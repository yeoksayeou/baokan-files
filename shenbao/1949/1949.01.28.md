### Li Zongren Telephones Mao Zedong Urging Him to Send Representatives to Start Negotiations; Explains That Today's Matter is Not About the Honor or Disgrace of One Party or One Person; Hopes for Swift Cessation of Hostilities, Bringing About Peace and Harmony

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] Acting President Li telegraphed Mao Zedong on the 27th, urging him to send representatives to agree on a location and begin peace talks. The original telegram read: "Brother Runzhi: Since the breakdown of the Political Consultative Conference and following the eight years of war against foreign aggression, the civil war has lasted for more than three years. The nation's vitality is greatly damaged, and the people suffer immensely. Ceasing hostilities and seeking peace has become the unanimous call of the nation today. Therefore, from the day I took office, I resolved to use the utmost sincerity and make the greatest efforts to promote the realization of peace. The statement I issued on the 22nd and the telegrams I sent to Mr. Ren Chao, Mr. Hengshan, Mr. Bojun, and Mr. Dongshen, I believe have all been received. The country is now in such a state of ruin, and the people are suffering so deeply. The destruction of fields and cities, the deaths and injuries of innocent people, are countless. Wives separated from husbands, children separated from parents, crying from hunger and cold, are everywhere. All this is caused by the war. In the past, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, under the leadership of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, jointly devoted themselves to the Chinese revolution. Unfortunately, due to differences in political views, internal strife arose, causing such a catastrophe for the country and the people. Looking back on the past, how can we not feel heartbroken? If we truly believe that the purpose of the revolution is to increase the interests of the people and the nation, and that the motivation of the revolution is based on the will of the majority of the people, then no matter how different the propositions and political views of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party may be, in today's situation, there is absolutely no reason to continue resorting to force, killing each other, to increase the suffering of the people and the nation. There is no other way to follow except to follow the national will, cease hostilities and seek peace, and engage in a political solution. Otherwise, our crimes will truly be unpardonable even if we die a hundred times. In the past, you, sir, have repeatedly declared your willingness to seek a peaceful solution. The current government has expressed its sincerity for peace through words and actions. All the demands previously made by people from all walks of life across the country, such as the release of political prisoners, freedom of speech, and protection of people's freedom, are being gradually implemented. The facts are there for all to see; how can they be called false? I hope you, sir, will call upon your comrades in the Party to jointly and quickly promote peace talks, immediately dispatch representatives, agree on a location, and begin negotiations. If the war can be stopped for one day, thousands of national lives will be saved, and thousands of orphans and widows will be reduced. If we can all understand the difficulties of the time and meet each other with sincerity, everything can be resolved. The eight conditions proposed by your side, the government has recognized that they can be used as a basis for peace talks. All issues can be discussed and decided during the negotiations. Before the discussions between the two sides have even begun, to demand that the other party must first implement certain conditions, how can this be called peace talks? If past grievances and rights and wrongs are given too much importance, then revenge will beget revenge, and there will be no end to it. Alas, my compatriots, I fear there will be no hope. You, sir, and I will both become eternal sinners of the nation. Furthermore, your broadcasts have repeatedly stated that the government's advocacy of peace this time is a conspiracy of the government colluding with a certain country. This view is obviously derived from a certain prejudice. Since the War of Resistance against Japan, my foreign policy has always been based on being friendly to neighbors and treating them with kindness, without any favoritism. All that is helpful to the peaceful construction of our country should be closely cooperated with. In the future, we can only follow this principle to ensure peace in East Asia and the independence and autonomy of our country. You, sir, are wise and will certainly agree. In short, today's matter is not about the honor or disgrace of one party or one person, but about the lifeline of the nation and the life and death of the people. I personally have no selfish motives or concerns about gains or losses. If we can quickly eliminate the war and bring about peace and harmony, allowing me to relinquish my responsibilities early and return to my original position, it is what I pray for every moment. I sincerely express my intentions, hoping for your wise consideration and a reply. Your brother, Li Zongren, January 27th, Secret Seal of the Capital."

### Key Leaders of the Ministry of National Defense Hold Important Meeting; Zhang Zhizhong Flies to Wuhan This Morning

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Acting President Li convened a meeting of key leaders of the Ministry of National Defense at the Ministry of National Defense on the morning of the 27th. Xu Yongchang, Gu Zhutong, Tang Enbo, Zhou Zhirou, Gui Yongqing, and others attended. It is reported that important discussions were held. At noon, he also invited Legislative Yuan members Yin Shuxian, Huang Yuren, Qiu Changwei, and others to a banquet, during which they exchanged many opinions on the current situation, especially discussing the content of the CCP's broadcasts in recent days.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The government's determination to sincerely seek peace has not been shaken by the CCP's broadcasts in recent days. People close to Acting President Li said that the Acting President still holds the attitude of doing his best and continues to work for peace. The government's pursuit of peace is with the utmost sincerity, so it is still quietly waiting for the CCP to send representatives and designate representatives so that peace work for the benefit of the people can be carried out immediately. However, according to the feelings obtained by our reporter from various parties throughout the day on the 27th, they all feel that the prospects for peace are dim due to the CCP's broadcasts, and some people have even expressed negative intentions.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Zhang Zhizhong will fly back to the Northwest by special plane on the morning of the 28th. Li Pinsian will accompany him to Wuhan. Mr. Zhang may make a short stop in Wuhan and then fly directly to Lanzhou.

[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] Shao Lizi told Chinese reporters that the government delegation is ready and can fly to Beiping at any time. There is much speculation here, with some saying that the delegation may plan to go to Beiping without waiting for the CCP's consent, but well-informed sources believe this news is inaccurate.

### Nanjing Professors Form People's Delegation to Fly to Beiping Tomorrow to Convey True Public Opinion and Promote Comprehensive Peace

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The People's Peace Delegation, jointly formed by the China Peace Promotion Association and the National Policy Research Association of Professors from Various Universities in China, consisting of seven professors including Wu Yuhou, has borrowed transportation from the government and will travel to Beiping to appeal for peace. It is reported that the Executive Yuan has agreed to allocate a plane. In order to immediately save the people from the scourge of war, they will not spare their efforts and plan to fly to Beiping on the 29th (Lunar New Year's Day) to convey the true expectations of the people, so as to promote comprehensive peace. The original telegrams sent to Ye Jianying, Deng Baoshan, and Zhou Binglin are recorded separately as follows:

(1) Mr. Ye Jianying of the Beiping Joint Office, and forwarded to Mr. Mao Zedong: After eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, the nation's vitality has been damaged. After three years of internal strife, the country's pulse is about to break. The people are suffering and urgently need peace. Our association has been running around and appealing for it for a month, which I believe you have seen. Recently, rumors from various parties indicate that the prospects for peace are turning dim, while the people's desire for peace is becoming more urgent. In order to convey the true public opinion, our association has specially organized a People's Peace Delegation, with a total of ten representatives and reporters. It will fly from Nanjing to Beiping at 10:00 a.m. on the 29th of this month, arriving around 2:00 p.m. on the same day. We respectfully hope that you will inform the security personnel and provide assistance. We look forward to it, and this telegram is sent in advance. Please note. China People's Peace Promotion Association, National Policy Research Association of Professors from Various Universities in China, respectfully. Printed on the 27th.

(2) Mr. Deng Baoshan of the Beiping Joint Office, and forwarded to Mr. Fu Zuoyi: Recently, the prospects for peace talks have turned dim.

(3) Mr. Zhou Binglin of the Faculty of Law of Peking University, and forwarded to professors from various universities in Beiping, newspaper offices, and people's organizations: As the civil war continues, the prospects for peace are dim. The wealthy officials have all fled far away, and the victims will inevitably be innocent civilians. In order to convey the true public opinion, our association has specially organized a People's Peace Delegation, with a total of about ten members and reporters. It will fly from Nanjing to Beiping at 10:00 a.m. on the 29th of this month. We will seek a good meeting at that time to jointly plan for comprehensive peace. This telegram is sent in advance. Please note. China People's Peace Promotion Association, National Policy Research Association of Professors from Various Universities in China, respectfully. Printed on January 27th.

### U.S. State Department Orders Minister to Remain in Nanjing and Adopt a Wait-and-See Policy; Clark Leads a Small Group of Staff to Guangzhou

[United Press, Nanjing, 27th] It is now confirmed tonight that the U.S. State Department has instructed U.S. Ambassador to China Stuart, Leiden to continue to stay in Beijing and adopt a "wait-and-see" policy, while Minister-Counselor Clark leads a small group of staff to move to Guangzhou with the Chinese government. It is expected that this move by the U.S. will have a decisive impact on the actions of diplomatic envoys from various Western countries here. Envoys from the North Atlantic Group countries have held three meetings in the past eighteen hours to discuss whether to move south. Most embassies are still waiting for instructions from their governments to act. As for the Soviet Embassy and the embassies of Czech and Poland, they will abide by the provisions of their credentials and move south with the government.

### Tong Guanxian Entertains Legislators in Shanghai

[Our City News] Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., he held a tea party at the New Life Club to entertain more than 70 legislators in Shanghai. Mr. Tong delivered a speech first, saying that the purpose of the tea party was to report on the government's relocation situation. The Executive Yuan has now decided to work in Guangzhou on February 5th. The Legislative Yuan plenary session was originally scheduled to be held on February 1st, but due to the current situation, it is difficult to hold a meeting in Nanjing, so it has been decided to reconvene in Guangzhou in mid-February. It is now necessary to make relocation preparations immediately. Vice President Liu Jianqun is responsible for finding a venue in Guangzhou. The travel expenses for legislators to go to Guangzhou for the meeting have been approved by the Executive Yuan and will be paid by the government. Most of the Legislative Yuan staff have voluntarily dispersed, and there are less than 100 people left in Nanjing to work. Chen Guyuan and Fang Zhichao then spoke, advocating that the Legislative Yuan should find a place near Nanjing and Shanghai to reconvene in order to promote the realization of peace and should not move south. Zhang Qingzhen and others believed that the Legislative Yuan should be located in the capital, and that if it does not move, it is easy to breed abuses. However, they emphasized that after moving to Guangzhou, there should be a thorough review of all the resolutions and suggestions made by the Legislative Yuan in the past, whether they have all been accepted and implemented by the government, and criticized the long delay in adjusting the treatment of public school teachers and staff, the changing policies on exchange deposits, and the failure of local authorities to release detained students. They all advocated that the Legislative Yuan should fully play its role in the future. Mr. Tong then replied: The Legislative and Executive Yuans have a close relationship, so the Legislative Yuan must move. The current problem is how to solve the various relocation difficulties so that the meeting can be held in Guangzhou as scheduled in February. The Legislative Yuan has decided to set up offices in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Guilin to handle relocation matters. In Shanghai, Mr. Ma Shuli is responsible for liaison and registration. The meeting then adjourned at 6:00 p.m. It is also learned that Mr. Tong is scheduled to return to Nanjing today.

### 30 U.S.-Supplied Fighter Planes Arrive in Taiwan

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 27th] About 30 Mustang fighter planes were shipped from the United States three days ago and unloaded at Keelung Port. This batch of planes was purchased with funds allocated by the U.S. for military aid to China. Although it is inevitably too late for aid to China, it is reported that more will continue to arrive in the future.

### Chen Cheng Says Order to Release Zhang Xueliang Has Not Yet Arrived; Deng Xihou Orders Investigation of Yang Hucheng Case

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 27th] Chairman Chen Cheng met with visiting reporters at 3:00 p.m. today and, in response to inquiries about the release of Zhang Xueliang, replied that the order had not yet arrived. Jing Shang Hot Springs, where Mr. Zhang lives, is still refusing visits.

[Our Newspaper, Chongqing, 27th] Deng Xihou invited Liu Yuqing, Yan Yucong, and Li Baomi for confidential discussions at 4:00 p.m. on the 27th. The participants refused to disclose anything about Yang Hucheng. Mr. Li also said that he was not clear, while Mr. Yan said that two military planes did come to Chongqing from Nanjing this morning, and the mission of one of them was unknown, but it was definitely not carrying Yang Hucheng to Nanjing. Deng Xihou avoided meeting reporters all day and sent Zeng Wenxian at 4:00 p.m. to say that he was ordering subordinates to investigate the Yang Hucheng case.

### Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng Arrive in Shanghai to Fly to Guangzhou in a Few Days to Preside Over the Affairs of the Executive Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] After the government decided to move the capital, in addition to the various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan working in Guangzhou on the 5th of next month, the heads of the various ministries and commissions are scheduled to go to Guangzhou starting on the 1st. Executive Yuan President Sun Ke and Vice President Wu Tiecheng flew to Shanghai on the 27th and can transfer to Guangzhou immediately. The political center will soon be moved from Nanjing to South China, but those who are waiting for the CCP's response to proceed with peace talks will remain in Nanjing.

[Our Newspaper News] Executive Yuan Vice President Wu Tiecheng flew to Shanghai from Nanjing at 11:00 a.m. yesterday and received many guests at his private residence in Wanglu in the afternoon. Mr. Wu will fly to Guangzhou by plane in a few days to preside over government affairs. He will not have any important political activities in Shanghai, but he may also meet with third-party figures here in a private capacity to exchange views on the current situation. It is reported that President Sun Ke also arrived in Shanghai yesterday, but Sun's residence firmly stated that the president is still in Nanjing. In addition, the Executive Yuan will work in Guangzhou starting in February, and the Deputy President will personally preside over it. The arrival of the two men in Shanghai is of a transit nature.

### Part of U.S. Marine Corps in China to Withdraw Soon; Plan to Train National Army Announced to End

[United Press, Our City News] U.S. Western Pacific Naval Commander Badger told reporters on the 27th that a portion of the U.S. Marine Corps will withdraw from China soon, but plans to retain sufficient strength to deal with any emergencies. The Marine Corps currently stationed in China has about 3,000 in Qingdao and 600 in Shanghai, which exceeds the need. Part of the Qingdao Marine Corps is being moved from shore barracks to warships. However, it is pointless to keep too many people on the ships, and those who are not needed are better off being sent to Guam and other places. Mr. Badger did not disclose how many Marine Corps stationed in China will be reduced or whether it will affect the Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, but he believes that the Marine Corps staying on ships does not violate the sovereignty of the host country according to international law. The U.S. policy of maintaining sufficient troops in China to prevent riots and protect U.S. citizens and other foreigners will not change. Mr. Badger hopes that the handover of various places in China will be as peaceful as Beiping. The U.S. Navy and Marine Corps do not participate in the Chinese civil war and will strictly abide by the non-interference policy. When asked what would happen if the Communist Party demanded the withdrawal of the U.S. Navy after taking control of China, Mr. Badger replied that he might withdraw, but this should be decided by the government. He only knows how to follow orders and it depends on the need to prevent riots and protect overseas Chinese.

[United Press, Pearl Harbor, 26th] The U.S. Pacific Fleet Command announced today that the four destroyers "Duncan," "Perkins," "Rodgers," and "Duke" sailed to Qingdao yesterday to serve in the Western Pacific Fleet. This move is "routine redeployment in the area."

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 27th] The United States has officially terminated its military training program for Nationalist China. This move can remove another obstacle on the road to peace between the KMT and the Communists. The CCP had accused a U.S. military group of actively assisting the government in combat, which the United States denied. Except for a few U.S. military personnel, they all took a ship to Japan and returned to the United States on the 27th.

### Communist Representatives for Beiping Joint Office Determined; Minor Problems Remain Regarding National Army Moving Outside the City

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th] The candidates for the Communist representatives for the Beiping Joint Office have been determined to be Ye Jianying, Xu Bing, Tao Zhu, and Rong Shihe. It is reported that some of them have entered the city, but the names are unknown. The personal representatives left behind by Vice President Li and Bai Chongxi are still in Beiping working for comprehensive peace, but the details of their activities are unknown.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 27th] The Communist army has not yet entered the city, and a considerable number of National Army troops are still stationed in the city. Street posts are densely distributed, and prices in the city are soaring. The old capital is in a desolate state at the end of the year, and the tension cannot be concealed in the midst of peace. It is heard that there are still minor problems regarding the National Army moving outside the city, which are waiting for the two sides to discuss and decide. It is unlikely that the Communist army will enter the city before the Spring Festival.

[United Press, Beiping, 27th] The Communist Party is still operating behind the scenes. All public institutions, such as public utilities and telecommunications, are managed by the original government personnel, making it difficult to believe that Beiping has been ruled by the Communist Party. It is reported that the Communist Party officials in charge announced that anyone who attempts to take over the above-mentioned institutions without permission will be punished. However, once the transition period is over, the Communist Party will openly manage Beiping. Peking University students are preparing to hold a large-scale parade to celebrate the arrival of the Liberation Army and to break free from the spiritual prison. Thirty-two professors from Peking University and Normal University also jointly issued a declaration supporting the eight conditions proposed by Mao Zedong as the only basis for true peace.

### Communist Army Automatically Withdraws Northward; National Army Enters Yangzhou City; Yizheng Has Not Been Abandoned and Was Relieved Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 27th] A company of the 13th Column of the Communist Army's Yi Department, which had invaded Yangzhou City, automatically withdrew northward from Bianyi Gate at 9:00 a.m. on the 27th. The 59th Division of the 4th Army, Wang Zuohua's Department, stationed in Shijiaqiao, heard the news and immediately advanced towards Yangzhou, entering the city safely without encountering any resistance along the way. It is heard that another unit of the National Army has advanced towards Taixian from Longwokou on the Zhen (Jiang) Xu (Liu Xu) line. At this moment, the National Army is adding elite troops to cross the Yangtze River north to work overnight. Zhou Delin, the magistrate of Jiangdu County who was left in Guazhou waiting for orders, is scheduled to lead the staff to Yangzhou on the 28th. The Zhen (Jiang) Wei (Liu Wei) Zhen (Jiang) Kou (Bank) ferry will also be restored. At present, 200,000 citizens of Zhenjiang are welcoming the New Year with a happy mood. Also: Yizheng was relieved on the morning of the 27th after reinforcements arrived (the previous report of withdrawal was inaccurate), and the county town is still firmly defended by the stationed troops.

[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 27th] The situation north of the Yangtze River is completely quiet today. In Jingjiang, our powerful troops have been reinforced, and the situation is excellent. We have also reinforced the port area. We have reinforced Liuxu and Guazhou twice yesterday and today. At 4:00 p.m. this afternoon, we advanced towards Shijiaqiao to search for the local Communists. There has been no activity in Yizheng today. In general, the Communist army in northern Jiangsu has no formal main force, has extremely poor equipment, and has no offensive capability.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Jingjiang City, across the river from Wangyin, was invaded by more than a thousand Communist troops before dawn on the 26th. Also, the Communist army stationed in Yangzhou is reported to be the Gaoyang Independent Regiment of Gu Weihang's department. The connection with Guazhou Gudutou, south of Yangzhou, was also interrupted starting on the 26th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] The National Army, from Chongming in the east to Wuhu in the west of the southern bank of the Yangtze River, has not only taken up its positions and completed the deployment, but also drawn elite troops, such as paratroopers, to complete the organization of mobile divisions under the CCP's delayed peace talks and accelerated military offensive. These mobile divisions are transported by ten trucks, and each soldier is a light machine gunner, so that if a small group of the Communist army steals across any part of the long Yangtze River defense line, they can quickly rush to annihilate them. In addition, most of the Yangtze River civilian ships have been summoned to the south bank. It is reported that although Chen Yi has deployed troops north of the Yangtze River, he is still waiting for Lin Biao's troops to move south and reinforce before launching a large-scale crossing of the river.

[Our Newspaper, Puzhen, 27th] The KMT and Communist armies on the southern section of the Jinpu Railway are still in a stalemate between Dongge, Xige, and Wuyi. On the 27th, there were only local small contacts all day long. The Communist army's front-line forces are Chen Yi's 12th and New 1st Columns, the former stationed on the railway side and east of the railway, and the latter stationed in Quanjiao and its northern Shizilu. Because the National Army controls a strong force of four armies in the two Pu areas, the military judges that people in the capital may not have to replace firecrackers with artillery fire to embellish this upcoming Lunar New Year. [Our Newspaper, Puzhen, 27th] It is reported that about 3,000 local Communists have sneaked into Kongcheng, east of Tongcheng in central Anhui, and are advancing towards Tongcheng to invade and harass.

### If the Communist Army Continues to Attack, the National Army is Determined to Resist in Self-Defense; Deng Wenyi Speaks at a Press Conference

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 27th] Ministry of National Defense Spokesman Deng Wenyi said at a press conference on the afternoon of the 27th that since the government called for peace, the National Army has adopted a defensive strategy in order to comply with the government's decision. The National Army has now withdrawn to the Weijiang defense line, but the Communist Army is still attacking. For self-defense, the National Army is determined to resist on the Yangtze River defense line. At present, ten columns of the Communist Army have been found concentrated in northern Jiangsu and on both sides of the Jinpu Line. About four columns are in the Taixian and Yangzhou area, which is the main force of Shanxi and Henan. There are still six columns on the Jinpu front and on both sides, but each column has no more than 10,000 people, totaling about 200,000 people. The National Army has more than 300,000 people, plus the cooperation of the navy and air force. It is believed that if the Communist Army invades, it will suffer a serious blow. According to Mr. Deng, the Communist Army on the Jinpu front has now reached Wuyi, 30 miles north of Puzhen. It is expected that the Communist Army may launch an offensive within the next week.

### Defense Ministry Announces One Week of War Situation

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The Ministry of National Defense today announced the war situation for the week from January 20th to 26th as follows: For the past week, in order to comply with the Executive Yuan's decision for an unconditional ceasefire and to promote the early realization of peace, which is the unanimous desire of the entire nation, the national army in various regions has proactively withdrawn from certain areas to show sincerity for peace. Therefore, except for a few areas where the communist army invaded and the national army had small-scale resistance and outpost contact, it was generally peaceful. However, some communist troops constantly attacked the national army. After repeated tolerance, the national army also counterattacked. The details are as follows:

(1) Jianghuai Area: Disregarding the national people's ardent desire for peace, the communist army has been pressing southward day after day, and has approached the north bank of the Yangtze River in several places. In order to comply with the government's decision and to show sincere intent for peace negotiations, the national army on the Jinpu Railway line voluntarily withdrew from Bengbu on the 19th, Chuxian on the 23rd, the national army in northern Jiangsu withdrew from Rugao on the 22nd, Yangzhou on the 24th, the national army in northern Anhui withdrew from Hefei on the 21st, Yexian on the 24th, and tolerated the communist army in areas such as Mingguang, Jiashan, Zhangbaling, Quanjiao, and Taixian in northern Jiangsu. The vanguard of the communist army under Chen Yi's 12th Column and the 34th Brigade of the Jianghuai Independent Brigade, moving south along the Jinpu Railway line, had contact with the national army. The follow-up troops are Chen Yi's nine columns, four of which have reached the counties of Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Liuhe, and Tianchang. The other five columns are also moving south along the Jinpu Railway line, reaching the vicinity of Yuxian. Although the communist army is pressing hard, appearing to launch a larger offensive soon, its strength is limited. Each column has only over ten thousand men. Moreover, our Yangtze River defense has been tightly deployed. Therefore, if the communist army attempts to cross the Yangtze River by stealth, it will be difficult to succeed. The national army now secures several important forward bases on the north bank of the Yangtze River, such as Taixian, Yangzhou, Yizheng south of Yangzhou, and Jiangpu. If the Yangtze River defense war is unavoidable, the price the communist army pays will be heavier than the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign. The national army can achieve the effect of favorable timing, geographical advantages, and popular support, and the future of the war situation can be changed.

(2) North China Area: In order to shorten the war, achieve peace, and preserve the ancient capital of Beiping and its cultural relics, General Commander Fu Zuoyi issued a proclamation on the 22nd, announcing a ceasefire starting from 10:00 AM on the 22nd. Most of the national army in Beiping immediately followed the headquarters' instructions, successively withdrawing from the urban area and entering designated locations. A small part of the communist army has entered the urban area, and ceasefire will also be implemented in Suiyuan and Datong.

(3) Eastern Gansu Area: There are more than 1,600 communist troops in the Guyi area. On the 21st, the communist army continuously attacked the national army. For self-defense, our Eastern Gansu Corps immediately counterattacked. After only four hours of fierce fighting, the entire 21st Regiment of the communist army was annihilated. It is estimated that more than 700 communist troops were killed and more than 400 were captured alive. The victory in Eastern Gansu proves that if the communist army remains obsessed with its course, it will inevitably suffer a fatal blow under the hatred of the people of the whole country.

(4) Northern Jiangsu Area: The national army is currently holding the line from south of Yangzhou to Yizheng. On the 22nd night, a part of the communist army attacked Yizheng. The battle continued until the evening of the 23rd, when the defending troops repelled the invading communist army. In the Liuhe area, more than 2,000 communist troops attacked on the 22nd night. The defending troops immediately launched a fierce counterattack, and the war is still continuing nearby.

In summary, given the facts of the past month and the recent week, the communist army has no sincere intention for peace, still believes in force, and continues to harass. If this continues, with the support of the army, navy, and air force, and the support of the people of the whole country, relying on the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, we will surely rise up and annihilate the communist army's invasion. In the future, who is a warmonger and who sincerely wants peace talks, the people of the whole country can make a righteous judgment based on the facts.

Editorial

### Shanghai Citizens Beware of Fire

As the end of the year approaches and winter fire prevention becomes crucial, the safety and order of Shanghai society, as well as the stability of its society, have become the most concerning issues for both the authorities and the people. While the maintenance of social order is being addressed by the municipal police authorities with various measures, ensuring social safety relies on the joint efforts of the authorities and the people. Considering the facts of the past month, the most significant threat to the lives and properties of Shanghai citizens, the materials and equipment of industries and businesses, and the public and private building facilities, aside from the spread of war, is the threat of fire. This is a serious problem for urban society, and as the days ahead are long and fortune is unpredictable, we must urgently call on the municipal authorities and the citizens to "Beware of Fire."

Shanghai is a major city in the East and the largest port of import and export in Southeast China. Commerce and industry are prosperous, and the population is concentrated at nearly six million. Housing is densely packed, buildings are poorly constructed, fire protection is inadequate, and the general public lacks a spirit of self-governance and a sense of responsibility. This poses many obstacles and difficulties to the promotion of public welfare and the maintenance of public safety. The major fire on Wuding Road in the spring of the year before last burned for thirteen hours, turning the houses and properties on half a street into ashes. The major fire in the Maochang warehouse on Nanxun Road burned for thirty hours, destroying a large amount of supplies from the Executive Yuan for Relief and Rehabilitation Affairs. These were unprecedented major fires in Shanghai. The public and private losses, and the trauma of the citizens, still exist and are difficult to compensate for. These two major fires in the past served as a test of fire protection administration, and also a test of the citizens' lack of moral awareness and the lack of reasonable building facilities. After such major traumas, active and passive fire prevention have greatly improved in recent years, but the general public lacks a sense of vigilance and is careless in their daily lives, resulting in frequent fire alarms, which further increases the factors of social instability.

Considering the facts of this January, a major fire on Zhongxing Road, Zhabei on the 6th destroyed five to six hundred households; a major fire on Duojia Road, Nanshi on the 8th destroyed more than two hundred households; a fire occurred on Guangzhao Road, Zhabei on the 12th, claiming the lives of approximately one thousand households. Most of these destroyed households are poor citizens who live in makeshift shelters. After the disaster, they are exposed on the streets, suffering from hunger and cold, and in extreme distress, turning into a severe social problem. The painful lessons of the fires in Nanshi and Zhabei have not awakened the vigilance of the citizens. As a result, there have been fires every day since January. On the 25th alone, there were six fires, which threatened social safety and increased the poverty problem, which is a matter worthy of attention. Now that the situation is unstable and society is chaotic, the general public should cultivate a sense of vigilance for social safety and personal safety, in order to reduce or eliminate the occurrence of fires. Life in a big city is a common life. For the promotion of public welfare and the maintenance of public safety, being careful about fire in extraordinary times should be an extraordinary attitude held by the people in the common life of the city.

Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, using fire for heating and setting off firecrackers can easily cause more fires, so caution is essential! Preparation prevents problems; lack of preparation causes failure. For the safety of Shanghai citizens' lives and properties, the safety of industrial and commercial materials and equipment, and even for the stability of social order, we hope that the authorities and the people will jointly plan to prevent the occurrence of fires. In short, being careful about fire is everyone's responsibility. Everyone must be vigilant and responsible to turn fire hazards into harmony and eliminate disasters in the invisible. On the part of the municipal authorities, in addition to actively replenishing fire protection equipment, improving the treatment of fire protection personnel, and arousing the sense of responsibility of fire protection personnel, it is also necessary to implement household safety inspections, restrict the use of kerosene, prohibit setting off firecrackers, and, if necessary, evacuate the population. On the part of the citizens, it is hoped that everyone will have a sense of responsibility and cultivate a spirit of self-governance. The ability to respond in extraordinary times requires cultivating a spirit of self-governance, which can then be developed into a spirit of common life in urban society. We believe that "there must be loyal and trustworthy people within ten households." Shanghai citizens are not lacking in wisdom. If everyone can maintain a cautious attitude, fathers teach their sons, husbands teach their wives, and housewives teach their servants, with every family thinking about public safety, and every household thinking about family interests, being careful everywhere, and being vigilant at all times, and engaging in fire prevention in psychology and behavior, then fire can be prevented before it ignites.

### Pan Gongzhan Talks About the Future of Peace: Whether It Can Be Realized Depends on the Thoughts of the Chinese Communists

[Central News Agency, This City] Yesterday, a reporter visited Speaker Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Council to inquire about his views on the future of peace talks and the possibility of local peace in Shanghai. Speaker Pan replied: Peace is desired by the people and sought by the government, which is beyond doubt. However, peace is a matter for both sides, and whether it can be realized truly depends on the thoughts of the Chinese Communists. President Chiang resigned resolutely to seek peace, and Acting President Li is even willing to discuss Mr. Mao Zedong's eight conditions and has first made various sincere gestures such as releasing political prisoners. Naturally, all are for the sake of the people. However, the Chinese Communists have recently broadcasted that they have not yet designated representatives and locations, and have repeatedly expanded their list of "war criminals." It is unknown who the Chinese Communists will negotiate peace with? For example, myself, standing in the position of the Shanghai Municipal Council, am the same as Speaker Xu Huidong of the Beiping Municipal Council. Almost every day we beg for peace on behalf of the people, but both of us have been honored with the title of "war criminal" by the Chinese Communists. I wonder if the generals in charge of the war on the side of the Chinese Communists will also be called "war criminals" in front of the people? It is deeply regrettable that this kind of broadcast by the Chinese Communists may close the door to peace. In short, today we sincerely hope that both sides will purely consider reducing the suffering of the people, put aside prejudices, and tolerate each other. Ceasefire and seek peace must not involve a single "I" thought, and there must be no arrogance, only then can we hope for success. I still remember that when the Kuomintang and the Communist Party negotiated in the winter of 1946, the Kuomintang not only never put forward a so-called list of "war criminals" to block the door to peace, but also welcomed Mr. Mao Zedong and others to visit the capital for consultations. How can we not feel emotional when we look at the past! As for war and peace, it is originally a whole question. If the flames of war continue to spread due to the Chinese Communist's continuous advance, then right and wrong will be even clearer. We Shanghai citizens love peace, but also love freedom and justice. Where the great righteousness lies and freedom is concerned, the past events of January 28th and August 13th are still fresh in our minds. We sincerely hope that the gentlemen of the Chinese Communist Party, as fellow Chinese people, if they do not want to greatly damage China's vitality and are willing to preserve a glimmer of hope for the people, then their southward troops on the north bank of the Yangtze River should be able to rein in their horses and stop at the right time, cease fighting on the spot, in order to facilitate the reopening of peace talks. Otherwise, "when the nest is overturned, will there be any intact eggs"? Local peace may also become a dream. But no matter what, I dare to believe that Shanghai citizens will be willing to do their best to strive for genuine, democratic, and lasting peace.

[Our Newspaper] Washington, 27th Broadcast: The US House Armed Services Committee today reviewed the government's request to determine the number of army personnel and expand the air force to seventy groups. Secretary of the Army Royall attended the briefing and declared: "According to our estimates, war is unlikely to occur in the near future, but at least the possibility of war still exists. We should take appropriate measures to be prepared."

[United Press, Washington, 26th] The highest-ranking military leaders of the government presented an overview of the world military situation to the House Armed Services Committee on the 26th. They also analyzed President Truman's defense request for the 1950 fiscal year, including the proposed air force reduction. Committee Chairman Vinson said that this would waste a lot of money and could endanger national security. This general report was presented by Secretary of Defense Forrestal and the responsible generals of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Retired General Eisenhower also attended as Forrestal's special advisor.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 26th] Secretary of Defense Forrestal reiterated his opinion to the House Military Committee on the night of the 26th that there is no immediate danger of war. But he also said that in the long run, the danger of war is difficult to eliminate.

### US Foreign Aid Program, Congressional Leaders Express Support

These prominent senators also stated that Congress should support Truman's "world cooperation" plan and his request for 6.7 billion yuan in foreign aid appropriations. Congressional leaders said that from the US point of view, the Soviet Union's offensive timing was quite clever. It is reported that Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally and Senator Vandenberg are worried that the Soviet Union's "peace offensive" may deprive the government of votes on its foreign policy. Former Undersecretary of State Lovett also felt the same way. He said that if you want to be convincing, any peace gesture must come from actual performance. Regarding the Soviet Union's announcement of the establishment of the Economic Mutual Assistance Council with five Eastern European satellite countries, Senator Smith said that this move could prompt Congress to pass a huge foreign aid agenda.

### President Truman Talks to Reporters

[Our Newspaper] Washington, 27th Broadcast: President Truman declared at a press conference today that he had not heard of the message from Philippine President Quirino to the United States.

### British House of Commons Debates Holy Land Policy, Bevin Narrowly Wins Vote of Confidence, Government Prestige Weakened, Unease Revealed

[United Press, London, 26th] Foreign Secretary Bevin told the House of Commons on the 26th that the United Kingdom was prepared to recognize Israel, but there should be no more war in Palestine. After that, he won a vote of confidence of 283 to 193. However, more than 50 Labor Party members abstained, which shocked the party.

Since the Labor Party came to power, the majority vote obtained on major issues has been the smallest this time, and the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party unanimously opposed it. Congressional sources believe that Bevin's weakened position is mostly due to the Labor Party's failure to provide significant support. Bevin tried his best to defend his Palestine policy, and told the House of Commons during the debate that the United Kingdom and the United States are conducting "frank and open" discussions on their basic policies in the Middle East. Conservative Party leader Churchill condemned Bevin for being prejudiced against Israel, which was extremely clumsy, and said that the United States and the Soviet Union were both opposed to the United Kingdom on the Palestine issue. Churchill forced a vote of confidence, which was the first vote of confidence that the Conservative Party had requested on foreign policy since the Labor government came to power in July 1945.

[Our Newspaper] New York, 27th Broadcast: Lake Success: The Security Council discussed the Indonesian issue today. Indonesian representative Bella claimed that the four-power proposal may not be acceptable to the Netherlands, and since this proposal does not stipulate a mechanism to strictly order the Netherlands to implement it, it is tantamount to leaving a "political time bomb."

### Eastern European Economic Alliance, Polish Government Explains

[Agence France-Presse, Warsaw, 26th] A Polish government spokesperson told the press today that "the Economic Mutual Assistance Council, which was just established in Moscow, should not be regarded as an organization aimed at forming a bloc. He emphasized that one event is very important for Poland's economic future, that is, to try to change the bilateral agreements signed between Poland and certain countries into multilateral agreements. The spokesperson pointed out that Poland does not intend to restrict trade relations with Western countries, and the Polish government does not have to consult with the Economic Mutual Assistance Council before signing a trade agreement with another country. He continued, "The new agreement respects the sovereignty of the participating countries, and does not restrict them from only having economic interests with a certain power, which is different from the Marshall Plan." The spokesperson then condemned the United States for reducing Poland's imports to the United States by half last year, and for putting pressure on the International Reconstruction Bank not to grant Poland a loan of 100 million yuan to reorganize Poland's coal mines.

### Reorganization of Old Public Debt Treasury Bonds Approved and Implemented by Political Affairs Council

According to news, the "Measures for the Ministry of Finance to promptly formulate reorganization measures for public debt treasury bonds issued by the previous government and submit them for approval and implementation" passed by the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Council on the 16th of this month have been formulated by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Political Affairs Council on the 26th for approval and implementation. The principles are as follows:

(1) The previously determined graded addition multiple for legal currency public bonds will be multiplied by 50 based on the previously determined multiple and cleared at once in advance. (2) Public bonds issued in 1949 to reorganize US dollar bonds and old foreign currency bonds will be converted into the above public bonds at face value. The principal and interest due in the future will be paid in US dollars.

The newly revised measures and the key points of the 1949 reorganization of US dollar public bonds are as follows:

1.  Regarding the revised measures for the clearing of legal currency public bonds:

For the portion of the 17 types of legal currency public bonds issued in the past that had not yet matured and been repaid on August 20, 1948, the previous regulations stipulated that the addition multiple should be determined based on the market price of general legal currency public bonds on August 19, 1948, according to the order in which the bonds were issued, with the highest being 27,000 times and the lowest being 1,000 times, converted into gold yuan coupons, and cleared once in advance before the end of March 1949. It is now revised to increase the number of legal currency payable based on the face value of the old bonds, and then increase it to 1.35 million times for the highest and 50,000 times for the lowest, converted into gold yuan coupons, and cleared once in advance. The procedure must be completed within one month from the date of implementation of these measures in order to end it (attached revised multiple standard table).

2.  Regarding the revised measures for the exchange of foreign currency bonds for new bonds:

For the portion of the principal and interest of the four types of foreign currency bonds issued in the past, namely the 1938 Gold Public Bonds, the 1940 Construction Gold Public Bonds, the 1942 Allied Victory US Dollar Public Bonds, and the 1947 (US Dollar) Short-Term Treasury Bonds, that were actually sold and had not yet matured and been repaid on August 20, 1948, the previous regulations stipulated that they should be converted into the 1948 Reorganization Gold Yuan Public Bonds at the original exchange rate (i.e., 4 gold yuan per US dollar and 12 gold yuan per British pound). It is now revised to replace them with the 1949 Reorganization US Dollar Public Bonds at the original face value. All of them will be denominated in US dollars, and the principal and interest due in the future will be paid in US dollars. As for the two most recent interest coupons of the above four types of foreign currency bonds that were due after August 20, 1948, all of them will be cut off by the end of March 1949, and the amount of the deferred interest coupons will be calculated together with the outstanding principal of the bonds and replaced with the 1949 Reorganization US Dollar Public Bonds separately. The remaining fractions will be paid separately according to other measures in order to facilitate and clear the procedures.

3.  Key points of the 1949 Reorganization US Dollar Public Bond Regulations:

(1) Types: This public bond is divided into three types: A, B, and C.

(2) Use: Reorganizing old foreign currency bonds, i.e., exchanging Type A bonds for the first and second installments of the 1947 Short-Term Treasury Bonds. Exchanging Type B bonds for the 1938 British and US Gold Bonds and the 1942 Allied Victory US Dollar Public Bonds. Exchanging Type C bonds for the first installment of the 1940 Construction Gold Public Bonds.

(3) Issue Date: Issued at face value on April 1, 1949.

(4) Interest Rate: Annual interest rate of 3%, Type A bonds will begin paying interest on September 30, 1949. Type B bonds will begin paying interest on November 31, 1949. Type C bonds will begin paying interest on January 31, 1950. Interest will be paid every six months thereafter.

(5) Repayment Period: Lottery will be drawn at the beginning of each fifth interest payment period, and the principal will be repaid evenly. Lottery will be drawn every six months thereafter. Type A bonds will be repaid in 10 years, Type B bonds in 15 years, and Type C bonds in 25 years.

(6) Repayment Method: Both principal and interest will be paid in US dollars.

(7) The Ministry of Finance will allocate the amount of principal and interest due for each installment of the three types of bonds in advance from the foreign exchange in the national treasury and deposit them into the National Debt Fund Management Committee for special reserve payment.

(8) Bond Types: Fixed at six types: US$5, US$10, US$50, US$100, US$1,000, and US$5,000. All are in bearer form and cannot be reported lost.

(9) Exchange Procedures: Old US dollar bonds will be exchanged for this public bond at face value. British gold bonds will be exchanged for this public bond according to the exchange rate of gold pounds to US dollars quoted by the Central Bank (i.e., one to three). The exchange procedures will be completed entirely within a limited time after the bonds are printed. Any overdue bonds will be voided. The exchange procedures abroad will be handled in the same way.

### Elimination of Restrictions on Foreign Exchange Certificates Benefits Industrial Goods Imports

[Report from our newspaper] The issue of the transfer of foreign exchange certificates has recently become a focus of research for industrial and commercial circles, and all those concerned about the economy are paying attention to it. Our reporter, considering that this issue is also related to the interests of the industrial sector, interviewed those in charge of import and export businesses yesterday. According to them, some people believe that the removal of restrictions on the transfer of foreign exchange certificates will increase costs for the industrial sector. In reality, the interests of the industrial sector are not entirely the same as those of the import and export sector. Currently, the country lacks foreign exchange, and all imports depend on the injection of foreign exchange from exports. Without exports, there would be no imports, and industrial raw materials would inevitably face a crisis. Therefore, both the industrial and import sectors deeply hope for the prosperity of exports. Because restrictions on the transfer price of foreign exchange certificates have led to a decline, verification has stalled, and imports have been hindered. Industrial raw materials will be insufficient. Therefore, the demand to eliminate restrictions on the transfer of foreign exchange certificates is a unified step that should be taken by both the industrial and import/export sectors.

### To Maintain the Value of Student Aid Grants - Entrusting Taishan Rice Store to Purchase 18 Dan of Rice

In order to maintain the value of the "Reader's Student Aid Grant" and prevent it from depreciating, it has been decided to purchase medium-grade white japonica rice at any time with the donations received. When the grants are issued, they will be valued according to the actual price of the rice. In this way, the applying students may suffer less loss due to currency depreciation. In order to implement this plan, this newspaper has reached an agreement with the Taishan Rice Store on Henan Middle Road in this city. From now on, the donations will be handed over to the store to purchase rice, which will be sent to the hall for preservation. The Taishan Rice Store has generously agreed to provide this service free of charge, which is commendable. Yesterday, we entrusted them with 28,800 yuan of student aid funds to purchase 18 dan of white rice. Yesterday, Mr. Wang generously donated one old yuan, which was the largest donation in this session. We hereby express our gratitude.

### 車轔轔　馬蕭蕭　A Glimpse of Zhenjiang

— By Our Reporters He Xianglin and Chen Zhonglin

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, 25th] As the nationwide peace talks approach a climax, Zhenjiang, the capital of Jiangsu Province, is now facing the front lines. Yangzhou, an important town in northern Jiangsu across the river, has been completely evacuated by the garrison in a planned withdrawal by 10 PM on the 24th. As of this writing, the last of the military and government personnel are still crossing the river to the south in a continuous stream. The ferry service between Zhenjiang and Liuhe was suspended starting the morning of the 25th. The riverside docks are packed with thousands of refugees from Yangzhou, Taixian, and Gaoyou. Fortunately, they have not been ravaged by gunfire and fervently hope for an early realization of peace so that they can return home. On the east and west sides of the riverbank, the sound of vehicles rumble and horses neigh, armored vehicles constantly coming and going, creating a wartime atmosphere. Sandbags are piled up at various intersections, and engineers are working hard to build fortifications. Many sensitive Zhenjiang residents are leisurely saying: "These are the outer defenses of peace. It seems that neither side will continue fighting."

Sails Fully Loaded with Refugees

The Jiaoshan Temple, protruding from the river, which has always been secluded in a tranquil world, is now different from the past. Cruising around are naval patrol ships and countless gunboats, instead of tourists' painted boats. The fishing boats, which have always been accustomed to life on the water, have lost the means to rely on Jiaoshan for their livelihood. Now, there are only sails carrying groups of homeless refugees, passing by under the turbulent mountain waters, heading for safer shores on the river.

Sweeping Clearance Sale Signs

During the lunar New Year, people in Zhenjiang experienced deep emotions. Merchants were settling their profits and losses. Every household was anxious and planning for the end of the year and the arrival of the New Year. On the streets, vendors sold New Year cakes, firecrackers, door gods, Spring Festival couplets, and other items related to the New Year preparations. The shops, imitating Beijing and Shanghai, also hung up signs for "Sweeping Clearance Sales" and price reductions to attract business. Food shops were filled with "Jinhua Ham," "Guangdong Sausages," and "Nanjing Salted Duck," all kinds of preserved meats. The toys that children played with during the lunar New Year were also displayed on the streets, but the prices were high, and the provincial and county-level civil servants with meager incomes could only "covet the fish from the edge of the pond," admiring them for a while. Since yesterday, the streets and alleys have been adorned with new sights, "Selling Yangzhou Flowers," "Selling Yangzhou Flowers," evoking the feeling of "still selling Yangzhou flowers across the river." The hearts of people who have always lived in the warmth of Jiangnan are stirred by different emotions.

Trains Unprecedentedly Busy

In the past half month, the trains between Nanjing and Shanghai have been unprecedentedly busy and crowded due to the large-scale evacuation of various agencies in Nanjing. Every time a train from Nanjing arrives at the Zhenjiang station, it is already packed. Large numbers of passengers waiting for the train on the platform bridge, as well as carriers, risk jumping from the overpass onto the roofs of the cars or climbing in through the carriage windows, resulting in falls, injuries, or even deaths. In recent days, due to frequent military transport, trains have been delayed. The Shen Bao, Xin Bao, and Da Gong Bao in Shanghai also often miss their arrival in Zhenjiang. It is hoped that the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway authorities will quickly find a way to dispatch vehicles and schedules to ensure the safety of travelers.

Ding Zhi-pan Encourages Colleagues

The civil servants of various departments and offices under the province are now jointly requesting the provincial government to follow the example of the central government and issue severance pay to make arrangements for settling down. Chairman Ding Zhi-pan said to his colleagues at the memorial week meeting on the 24th: "At this time of national turmoil, we must stabilize ourselves and not disturb each other in order to stabilize society. Peace is what everyone hopes for, and we should await the decision of the central government. As for the livelihood of our colleagues, we are always concerned. The salary for January has been paid in advance, and the salary for February is also being advanced. We hope that we can unite in spirit and overcome the difficulties together." Finally, Ding encouraged them with "Righteousness should be upheld, not personal gain pursued," and "The Way should be understood, not personal merit calculated."

The First Line of River Defense

[Dispatch of 26th] Since the abandonment of Yangzhou on the night of the 24th, Zhenjiang has been the first line of defense along the Yangtze River. On the 25th alone, ferries between here and Liuhe across the river made extra trips to evacuate troops and refugees retreating from Yangzhou. The Communist troops only advanced to Shijiaqiao (11 li south of Yangzhou City). The troops and civilians who gathered at Liuhe on the 25th have all safely arrived in Zhenjiang. From the 26th, the Zhenjiang-Liuhe ferry was announced to be suspended. It is estimated that more than 20,000 troops and civilians retreated from southern Yangzhou. The refugee crowds wandering the streets along the Zhenjiang River further increased the bleakness of this end-of-year scene.

Hoping for Good News during the Spring Festival

After the abandonment of the outposts across the river, the Navy is cooperating with the Jiangnan land defense forces to carry out river defense tasks. River defense gunboats are closely monitoring the actions of the Communist troops in northern Jiangsu. Although this place faces the front lines, the citizens are calmly watching the development of the situation and especially hope that the Spring Festival will bring good news of peace. The five newspapers here will suspend publication during the Spring Festival and will provide news to the citizens daily in a joint edition. The provincial government has completed its preparations for relocation. Seventy percent of the personnel from various departments and bureaus will leave Zhenjiang first, with their families following them. The provincial government will issue free train tickets. The evacuating personnel and their families will await Chairman Ding's order and board the train to leave Zhenjiang at any time. Ding will lead the remaining 30 percent of the personnel to temporarily stay in Zhenjiang.

Sufficient Coal Supply

Here, due to the lack of coal, the water and electricity plant has been implementing power outages by region for two months. Now that the Spring Festival is approaching, and at a time of turmoil, the supply of water and electricity is especially indispensable. The provincial government implemented emergency measures on the 25th, requisitioning coal passing through to maintain the water and electricity supply in the provincial capital, impounding 1,700 tons, which the Zhenjiang water and electricity plant will pay for at 3,500 yuan per ton. This amount of coal is sufficient for the water and electricity plant for one month. During the Spring Festival, there will be no interruption of water and electricity throughout the city.

### Xilin Garden Residence in Xiamen Refurbished and Newly Decorated

[Dispatch from Xiamen, 26th] A few days ago, Reuters and Associated Press in Nanjing speculated that President Chiang might stay briefly on Gulangyu Island in Xiamen via Fuzhou in the near future. The news has been quite uplifting to the various circles here. According to some current indications, the rumors are not without basis. A month ago, the post of director of the Xiamen Police Bureau was assigned by the Presidential Office to Liu Shuzi, who was President Chiang's deputy adjutant. Since taking office, he has paid special attention to public security in Xiamen. At the same time, Xilin, the private garden of overseas Chinese Huang Zhonghuan, formerly the office of the Southern Fujian Division on Gulangyu Island, was taken over by Director Li sent by the Presidential Office for repairs. It is located under Zheng Chenggong's training platform on Sunlight Rock, with a spacious and towering area. Previously, it was quite dilapidated due to disrepair. Recently, after being repaired by personnel from the Presidential Office, it has been refurbished and newly decorated, and the layout is quite gorgeous. Police Chief Liu Shuzi has personally supervised the repairs.
