### The Peace Talks are Progressing Well; Disagreement Remains on the Issue of Dividing the Country Along the River; Yu Youren and His Entourage Flew to Beiping This Afternoon

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The formal peace talks, taking place in Beiping, have been underway for two days, and the situation is progressing well. The first meeting was held at 9:00 PM on the 13th in the Qin Zheng Hall of Zhongnanhai in Beiping, ending at 12:00 AM. The discussion focused on explanations and clarifications of the eight-point framework proposed by the CCP representatives, followed by discussion. Authoritative sources revealed that the CCP has conceded on the fundamental principles of the eight points, but a divergence of views remains on the crucial issue of dividing the country along the Yangtze River, necessitating further negotiations. This point may be even more important than the eight points themselves.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Yu Youren and his entourage, including Yin Shuxian, Qiu Changwei, Li Shijun, Gu Fengxiang, and Liu Yan (misreported as Liu Jun yesterday), have decided to depart for Beiping at 11:00 AM on the 15th, foregoing waiting for Huang Shaohong's return to Nanjing. Mr. Yu's preparations are complete. At 8:00 PM on the 14th, he convened a meeting at his official residence with his entourage to discuss their approach to providing advice in Beiping.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Government representative Huang Shaohong was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing from Beiping on the 14th to report on the progress of the talks in Beiping. However, the government received a telegram from Beiping stating that Huang had to attend to important matters and could not make the trip. It remains unknown as of this evening whether he can return to Nanjing on the 15th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] To discuss the peace talks already underway in Beiping and the reports from the government delegation, Acting President Li visited Premier of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin for a lengthy discussion on the afternoon of the 14th. Wu Tiecheng also visited He Yingqin in the afternoon of the 14th for discussions.

[United Press, Nanjing, 14th] A well-informed source stated that the preliminary peace agreement only pertains to broad principles. Some difficulties remain in the technical details of implementing these broad principles and need to be overcome during the negotiations. The source warned that it is difficult to be overly optimistic at this stage, as, based on past experience, technical details of negotiations are far more difficult to resolve than broad principles. The views of Guangzhou must be weighed and considered.

Liu Ziheng Issues Statement on Peace Talks

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Liu Ziheng, one of the "mysterious guests," arrived in Nanjing from Beiping and has been working for peace, meeting with the Acting President on several occasions to provide advice. Now that his mission is accomplished, he will return to Beiping by special plane within days. When interviewed by reporters on the evening of the 14th, he released the following statement on the KMT-CCP peace talks: "When the Anti-Japanese War was won and the Political Consultative Conference broke down, I firmly advocated peaceful democracy, unified nation-building, and opposed fratricide that would endanger the foundations of the nation. I published 'Nine Arguments Against Fighting' to declare this to the world. However, in reality, it resulted in three years of civil war. Voices advocating war filled the court, and the calamities of slaughter spread everywhere. Finally, heaven and earth responded, and the New Year's Day proclamation was issued in due course, followed by the eight conditions. The people of the nation, long suppressed, were able to express their deep desire for peace. My footsteps have taken me almost all over the country, and all who have blood in their veins desire governance. Since arriving in Beijing, I have met with Mr. Zhou Enlai, Mr. Li Jishen, Mr. Dong Biwu, Mr. Qi Yanming, Mr. Ji Fang, and others, who all unanimously expressed their sincere desire for peace. After arriving in Nanjing, I also met with Mr. Li Zongren, Mr. He Yingqin, Mr. Bai Chongxi, Mr. Wu Zhongxin, and other gentlemen, who also unanimously expressed their sincere desire for peace. Based on this, the fate of the nation will turn from misfortune to prosperity, and the lives of the people will be revived from death. The opportunity has emerged, and we must all work together, encourage each other, and promote the early success of the cause of peace. Ziheng silently observes the current situation and believes that there is no way to seek unity other than peace, and no way to seek the people's well-being other than unity. Looking towards Xikou, the spring sunshine is bright. Gazing towards Beihai, the green waves ripple. Although Mr. Mao Zedong and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek have never met me, I imagine that their enthusiasm for peace will surely fill the world with an atmosphere of harmony."

### KMT Legislators Convene in Nanjing to Discuss Forming Joint Organization; Heated Debate Nearly Leads to Physical Altercation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Over one hundred KMT legislators continued their meeting at the Sino-Austrian Cultural Association in Shipo'an on the morning of the 14th to discuss the content of a declaration and the formation of a joint organization. Chairman Chen Guyuan presided over the meeting. The opinions of those in attendance differed widely, and the debate was very heated. Two legislators nearly engaged in a physical altercation. The meeting began with a discussion of the organization's formation. The original drafters proposed the name "Legislative Yuan Democratic Comrades Association." Its charter stipulated that "the purpose of this association is to unite democratic and progressive legislators to discuss national affairs, promote political reform, and realize the Three Principles of the People." It also stipulated that members should abide by the following covenant: (1) The minority shall obey the majority, and the whole shall obey the resolutions; (2) The secrets of the association shall be kept confidential and not disclosed to outsiders; (3) Members may diligently encourage and criticize each other within the association, but shall not slander each other outside the association; (4) Without being recommended by the association, no member shall represent the association to speak or contact outsiders; (5) Major proposals must first be submitted to the association for discussion. After the proposal was presented for discussion, some immediately considered the name inappropriate. Because only over a hundred people attended this time, to call these hundred or so people "democratic comrades" would imply that those who did not attend were not democratic. The discussion continued for a long time and did not reach a conclusion. Finally, it was decided to wait until the declaration was issued and then determine whether a formal organization was needed based on the number of signatories. However, when discussing the content of the declaration, disputes arose again. The original drafters proposed four points for the declaration: (1) Absolutely and thoroughly support peace talks; (2) The Executive Yuan should truly be responsible to the Legislative Yuan and not be manipulated behind the scenes; (3) Remove all obstacles to political reform; (4) Emphasize that the corruption of politics and the abandonment of party affairs are due to the monopoly of power by a few people. After more than ten people proposed revisions and supplementary opinions, it was decided that the original drafters would reorganize the content and submit it to the next meeting for discussion.

### Hong Kong Bans Gold Transactions to Prevent Affecting Pound-Dollar Exchange Rate; Possession of Gold Prohibited Except for Those with Special Permits

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 14th] To protect the interests of the sterling area, the Hong Kong government has ordered a ban on all gold transactions and stipulated that no one may hold gold except those who obtain a special permit from the Governor of Hong Kong. The emergency measure was published in the Hong Kong Government Gazette on the 14th, which also prohibits the printing or publishing of any news related to gold transactions. An official statement issued simultaneously explained that the price of gold in the Hong Kong gold and silver market has consistently far exceeded the price of gold determined by the International Monetary Fund. Therefore, the Hong Kong gold market is effectively setting its own gold exchange rate. Although the Hong Kong government has strictly implemented measures to prohibit the import and export of gold for some time, the Hong Kong gold market continues to engage in a very large amount of gold transactions, and the amount of foreign exchange transactions in the open market is also very considerable. These phenomena are sufficient to affect the pound-dollar exchange rate. Since the order prohibiting the import and export of gold has failed to produce results, the Hong Kong government has had to take further measures to fulfill its obligations to the International Monetary Fund. Under special circumstances, the Hong Kong government will allow people who have not settled their transactions to understand their affairs, but they must prove that the specific amount of gold they traded did not violate the gold import ban implemented since May 16, 1948.

He then reported on Qingdao's military situation and economic overview. The gathering adjourned around 6:00 PM.

### Control Yuan Joint Meeting Passes Resolution; Transfer of Foreign Exchange from Taiwan and Xiamen Should Be Ordered to Be Returned by the Central Bank; To Be Handled Jointly with the Executive Yuan and the Selling of Gold Policy Case

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Control Yuan members Xiong Zaiwei, Ying Honglie, Hu Wenhui, Liu Pingjiang, Zhang Dinghua, Wang Xiangchen, Ren Bingjun, and others proposed that the Executive Yuan order the Central Bank to return the gold, silver, and foreign exchange transferred to Taiwan and Xiamen. This was passed at a joint meeting of the Control Yuan's Finance, Banking, Internal Affairs, and Food Policy Committees at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 14th and will be sent to the Executive Yuan. They request that this be handled swiftly and jointly with the case correcting the selling policy, to replenish reserves, enhance financial strength, and maintain the credit of the government's Gold Yuan Certificates. The original text of the proposal is as follows: "The Central Bank's reserves of gold, silver, and foreign exchange amounted to approximately several million US dollars in value as of the end of February this year, after investigation, including gold, silver, silver dollars, and foreign exchange (including US dollars, British pounds, and Hong Kong dollars, etc.). Since January of this year, the bank has, under orders, successively transferred over several tens of thousands of taels of gold and several tens of thousands of silver dollars to Taiwan, and over several tens of thousands of taels of gold and several tens of thousands of silver dollars to Xiamen, resulting in a significant reduction in the bank's headquarters reserves. This measure was originally intended as a temporary expedient. Now, with military and political expenses being enormous, income unable to offset expenses, currency inflation, and soaring prices, although the selling policy is used to adjust finance, alleviate prices, prevent speculation, and stabilize society, after investigation, a substantial amount of gold and silver has been sold since February 18th. This selling policy, in principle, should be to sell high and buy low, but the amount sold is becoming increasingly large, while the amount bought is limited. Moreover, the general speculators, being keenly aware, technically adept, and ruthlessly cunning, and because of the counter-evidence of certain facts, this selling policy not only cannot remedy financial difficulties, contract currency, and stabilize prices, but also fuels speculative forces, increases the power of the wealthy to snap up treasury reserves, accelerates financial bankruptcy, stirs up popular unrest, and causes social unease. If this continues, we deeply feel that the government's gold, silver, and foreign exchange reserves will become increasingly depleted, and the future outlook is dangerous and worrying. We therefore proposed a correction last month, requesting that the Executive Yuan formulate other effective policies and measures to rescue the situation in a timely manner, but we have not received a reply, which is regrettable. Now, the gold, silver, and foreign exchange reserves in Shanghai are limited, and the gold, silver, and foreign exchange used as reserves have been transferred elsewhere, further affecting the people's confidence in the Gold Yuan Certificates. At this critical time, although military and political expenses are being vigorously reduced, necessary expenditures and operations must be carried out to stabilize the lives of officers, soldiers, and public education personnel, and to contract currency and stabilize prices as much as possible, which is of utmost urgency. Therefore, in order to replenish reserves, enhance financial strength, and maintain government credit, it is necessary to return the originally transferred gold and silver from Taiwan and Xiamen for application. Therefore, we specifically propose that the Executive Yuan be requested to handle this jointly with the other case, so as to meet urgent needs and comfort public sentiment. Proposers: Xiong Zaiwei, Tang Honglie, Hu Wenhui, Liu Pingjiang, Zhang Dinghua, Wang Xiangchen, Ren Bingjun."

### Guangzhou Prohibits Outward Transfer of Silver

[United Press, Guangzhou, 14th] Guangdong military authorities defied Nanjing on the 14th and prevented the Central Bank from shipping large amounts of silver out of Guangzhou on orders from the Ministry of Finance. Garrison troops, under the orders of Yu Hanmou, Director of the Pacification Headquarters, prevented a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane from loading approximately seven tons of silver at Baiyun Airport. A military spokesman said it was estimated that a total of approximately fifty-four tons of silver and silver dollars were to be transported from Guangzhou within the week by six CNAC planes. The reason for preventing the loading was to prevent the local economic situation from further deteriorating. According to Central Bank officials, they are currently under orders from the Ministry of Finance to ship silver to Liuzhou, Nanchang, and Changsha.

### Proposal to Increase Railway, Postal, and Telegraph Rates to Be Discussed at Legislative Yuan Meeting Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] An increase in railway, postal, and telegraph rates is inevitable. The transportation authorities, mindful of the previous adjustment that caused intense resentment among the legislators, have decided to implement this adjustment only after it is passed by the Legislative Yuan. The Executive Yuan's request to amend the regulations on adjusting railway, postal, and telegraph freight and rates has been listed on the Legislative Yuan's agenda for the 15th. The request is to reduce the adjustment from a deduction of at least 50% to 25%, and to change the frequency of monthly adjustments from once to twice or three times. The Legislative Yuan's Procedure Committee, considering that this case urgently needs a decision, has directly submitted it to the meeting for discussion in accordance with the proviso of Article 8 of the Legislative Yuan Organization Law and listed it as a matter for discussion. The Executive Yuan's communication is as follows: "The Ministry of Transportation previously submitted the regulations on adjusting railway, postal, and telegraph freight and rates, which were resolved by the Legislative Yuan and have been implemented accordingly. However, in recent days, prices have soared, and revenue from rates is minimal. The transportation industry has reached a point where it cannot be maintained. We now intend to forward the following two articles to the Legislative Yuan for amendment in order to adapt to the facts: 1. In the original regulation 4 (the cost index multiplied by the pre-war railway, postal, and telegraph rates is the freight rate to be adjusted, but a reduction of at least 50% should be considered during the adjustment), it is proposed to change 50% to 25% in order to reduce subsidies; 2. In the original regulation 5 (monthly adjustments may be made once, and no adjustment will be made if the rate of increase in the index does not exceed 20% of the previous adjustment), it is proposed to change 'monthly adjustments may be made once' to 'adjustments may be made twice or three times' to be more practical. It is sincerely hoped that your esteemed Yuan will immediately submit this to the Yuan's meeting for resolution so that it can be implemented as soon as possible to maintain the transportation industry. This is a communication."

### Entire Jiangbei Region Enters Ceasefire State; Communist Troops Retreat One to Three Kilometers; Garrison Troops at Sanjiangying Have Returned to Original Positions

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] All the bridgehead positions north of the Yangtze River, downstream of Anqing, have entered a complete ceasefire state since dawn on the 14th. Furthermore, the Central China battlefield was quiet on the 14th with no fighting.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] The Communist troops have successively occupied the Nationalist bridgehead positions on the north bank of the Yangtze River downstream of Wangjiang, including Huayang, Zongyang, Tuqiao, Liujiadu, Dahekou, Siyuanning, Yizheng, Shijiaqiao, and Longshaogang. The remaining bridgeheads such as Anqing Yuxikou, Erba, Xiliangshan, Jiangpu and Liangpu areas (including Huaqiying, Puzhen, Pukou), Huazikou, Shierxu, Guazhou, Gaoqiao, Liuxu, and Baxu are still firmly defended by Nationalist forces. From the afternoon of the 13th, the Communist troops near the various bridgeheads, except for Anqing, Jiangpu, and the Liangpu area, retreated by one to three kilometers.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 14th] Confirmed information: (1) The war situation facing Zhenjiang is quiet. The garrison troops at Liuxu and the Communist troops are still facing off at the original positions on the line of Chenjia Lao Si Xu. There was a small contact in front of Shierxu today. After the Communist troops retreated north in the Yizheng area, a sense of emptiness was evident. The town of Tuqiao between Guazhou and Shierxu was attacked by a small group of Communist troops last night. After a counterattack by the garrison troops, the Communist troops retreated. (2) Last night, small groups of Communist troops on the southwest and northwest sides of Yangzhou, riding wooden rafts, made exploratory attempts to cross the river. After the naval gunboats stationed on the river surface discovered them, they rushed to bombard them, and the Communist troops retreated north. (3) At Sanjiangying, Communist troops gathered over 10,000 local Communists around 8:00 PM last night and attacked the Nationalist positions. They engaged in fierce fighting with the garrison troops for ten hours, and with the assistance of the navy in the river firing artillery, the Communist troops were unable to withstand it and retreated. The garrison troops at Sanjiangying restored their original positions.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 14th] A telegram from Zhenjiang said: Under the cover of the navy and air force, Nationalist troops recaptured the Sanjiangying bridgehead on the north bank today, which is sixteen miles northeast of Zhenjiang. It is estimated that two regiments and one battalion of Communist troops were annihilated in this battle. At the same time, Nationalist troops continued to actively deploy defenses on the south bank of the Yangtze River and completed defense works in an area three miles long on the south bank today.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 14th] A telegram from Wuhu said: When the Communist troops stopped attacking the bridgehead on the opposite bank of Wuhu yesterday, they issued a notice to the local residents, instructing them to bury the fallen Communist troops when the Communist troops withdrew. The notice was signed by Commander Huang of the Communist 3rd Army and stated that the Communist troops were retreating under orders from their superiors.

[Our Pukou Dispatch, 14th] The Nationalist forces opposite the capital [Nanjing] have been strengthened, but they still firmly defend the original positions of Jiangpu City and the Liangpu area. Six armies of the Communist troops, numbered 25, 26, 33, 35, and 36, are facing them. Although the pressure has not decreased, the probing attacks have ceased since the afternoon of the 13th.

[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 14th] Three or four hundred members of the 10th Army under Chen Yi, divided into two small groups on the night of the 13th, one group harassed Longhu Bridge north of the Agricultural School northeast of Anqing City, and the other group harassed Phoenix Mountain northwest of the city. Both were repelled by Nationalist forces before dawn on the 14th.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 14th] Military news: The lines in Central China have been relatively quiet for days. Last night, Communist troops outside Anqing harassed the Phoenix Mountain and Longwangmiao areas and have now been repelled.

### Order Concentrating Xianghe River Vessels to be Suspended by Authorities

Outskirts of Hankou Set up Checkpoints to Inspect People and Vehicles

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 14th] The local Communists lurking in the Zhurushan and Gaojiafan areas of Hanyang County have recently shown some movement. The authorities, seeing the Communist troops approaching Wuhan, in order to prevent the local Communists from attacking the inner-line strongholds, ordered the concentration of all Xianghe River vessels to the south bank of the Yangtze River a few days ago. The water security authorities, upon receiving the order, began implementing it the night before last. For a time, vessels gathered in the river, with over 10,000 registered (including wooden boats and small steamers). Citizens, not understanding the truth, showed considerable panic. It is now learned that the authorities, seeing the front line becoming quieter, are considering suspending the implementation in order to stabilize public sentiment, but non-essential vessels will still be ordered to dock on the south bank. Furthermore, the Wuhan city security authorities have set up checkpoints at key intersections in the suburbs, and pedestrians and vehicles are strictly inspected. Businesses in the urban area are also ordered to evacuate to Wuchang as much as possible.

Yuan Zhonghu Talks After Returning to Kunming

[Our Kunming Dispatch, 14th] Yuan Zhonghu, former mayor of Yingkou in Northeast China, returned to Kunming on the 13th to visit relatives after escaping captivity.

### Nationalist Forces Under Wang Sanzhu in Northern Henan Launch Raids and Sweeps; Have Entered Anyang and are Attacking Liuhegou

[Our Xinxiang Dispatch, 14th] Nationalist forces under Wang Sanzhu are currently conducting sweeps across a hundred li in northern Henan. Twenty days ago, the unit launched surprise raids on the Communist troops between Kaifeng and Yanjin along the Xin (xiang) Yan (jin) highway, and once entered Linqi, a mountain valley in the Taihang Mountains. They were invincible, and the administrative organs of the Communist areas along the way were swept away like clouds, and the public grain accumulated by the Communist troops was also emptied. Wang's unit has now entered Anyang, and part of it is sweeping through the mountainous area of Liuhegou. According to a telegram from the unit, they have achieved significant gains. The Communist troops in northern Henan feel unable to cope and are now mobilizing militias to block them.

### Xu Wentian's Written Statement Explains Nature of "Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary League"; Denies Plotting Troop Actions

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Xu Wentian, a legislator who was arrested and then released, distributed a mimeographed press release with his personal seal to various newspapers on the 14th, explaining the nature of the "Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary League." The original text is as follows: "A spokesman for the Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary League recently told reporters: Since March 28th, over ten comrades of this league, including Chen Tilu and Xu Wentian, have been arrested one after another. Rumors have been circulating, and there has been much speculation about the nature of this league. Most of the comrades of this league are historical members of the Chinese Nationalist Party, and all are committed to realizing the Three Principles of the People throughout their lives. Seeing that the nation's crisis is deepening and the people's suffering is intensifying, and that the Chinese Nationalist Party, which has been in power for fifty years since the revolution and in government for twenty years, is declining, all true followers of Mr. Sun Yat-sen are heartbroken. Therefore, based on the freedom of association clearly stipulated in the constitution, they resolutely gathered people inside and outside the Nationalist Party who truly believe in the Three Principles of the People and organized the Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary League to cultivate new momentum for realizing the Three Principles of the People in order to share the task of nation-building at this stage. As for political views, a political program has also been drafted to educate members. In summary, it is nothing more than two major goals: reforming politics and striving for peace. However, we recognize that reforming politics must first overthrow imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capitalism, and striving for peace must first eliminate hatred and suspicion towards all revolutionary political groups within the country. We also recognize that we can truly reform politics only if we can promote peace, and we can surely reform politics if we can truly realize peace. This is not only the unanimous demand of the entire country today, but also the current policy of the government. As for the participants, most are intellectuals, small and medium-sized bourgeoisie, and leaders of farmers and workers. Organizations in various places are growing. Whether military personnel participate is still uncertain, but it can be asserted that this league does not have a military department, has absolutely no relationship with any troops, and has never plotted the actions of any troops. To eliminate misunderstandings from the outside world, in the future, the league should uniformly reject current military personnel from joining. As the dawn of peace talks is breaking, this league has suddenly suffered this misfortune. In addition to appealing according to the law, we request that the arrested comrades be formally transferred to the judicial authorities for trial and present the truth of the matter to the people of the country. If this league can establish a correct direction for the country, any sacrifice is worthwhile."

### Shanghai Groups Telegraph Central Government, Requesting Punishment of Xu Wentian and Others

[Central News Agency, This City] The details of the arrest of Legislator Xu Wentian have been repeatedly reported in various newspapers. Mass organizations in this city, including the General Labor Union, jointly telegraphed the central government and the Legislative Yuan yesterday, expressing their opinions. The original telegram is recorded below: "To Acting President Li of the Presidential Palace in Nanjing, Premier He of the Executive Yuan, and President Tong and Vice President Liu of the Legislative Yuan: It has been reported that Legislator Xu Wentian's arrest was due to instigating a mutiny of the National Army and plotting to subvert the government, which constitutes a criminal offense and endangers the Republic of China. The evidence of his guilt is found in his confession and the testimonies of his accomplices. The case is extremely serious and should be strictly handled according to the law. His easy release should not occur because the procedures of the investigating personnel are incomplete. Moreover, his special status as a legislator should not allow him to escape justice. We believe that legislators who break the law not only tarnish the dignity of the people's representatives but also are sufficient to ignite the root of national chaos. The impact of this is not insignificant. In this era of democratic constitutionalism, everyone is equal before the law. We request that the government swiftly punish Xu Wentian and others according to the law to uphold the law, rectify right and wrong, and respect civil rights. We respectfully submit this telegram, hoping for your consideration. Shanghai General Labor Union, City Education Association, City Farmers' Association, City Women's Association."

[Central News Agency, This City] Legislator Xiong Dongnie yesterday made a statement on the arrest of Legislator Xu Wentian, saying: "Since legislators are also citizens, they should abide by the national law. Xu's arrest is still another matter that the procedures are incomplete. However, what Xu committed was instigating a mutiny of troops and plotting to subvert the government. The case is serious, and there is a confession and the testimony of accomplices. He cannot be placed outside the law because he is a legislator. For the dignity of the Legislative Yuan and the personality of the legislators, he should be brought to justice according to the law, which conforms to the principle that everyone is equal before the law."

### Silver Dollars Transported from Guangzhou Seized, Causing Dispute

[This Newspaper, Guangzhou, 14th] The Central Bank of Guangzhou, under the orders of the central government, was preparing to transport 14 tons of silver dollars (totaling 105,000 yuan) by air to Liuzhou to be handed over to the Joint Logistics Department for military expenses.

### Editorial: On High-Interest Rate Policies

Currently, the Central Bank's tools for controlling the market are nothing more than the two major policies of high prices and high-interest rates. The origin of these two major policies can be said to be to meet the financial objectives under the premise of "preparing for war and seeking peace."

At this stage, the financial difficulties can be considered to have reached their extreme. The salaries of military, government, and educational personnel are in urgent need of improvement, and the huge expenditures of political expenses continue unabated. Moreover, there is no US aid from the outside and no sufficient materials from the inside. With the fall of Beiping and Tianjin and the change of color in Xuzhou and Bengbu, tax revenues have decreased and burdens have increased. Anyone in charge of finance feels the pain of "cooking without rice!" Although finance is now continuing with the methods of expanding credit and expanding currency to artificially create purchasing power to make up for the deficit, in fact, it inevitably leads to soaring prices and high-interest rates. In this helpless situation, the authorities seem to have simply "adapted to the times" and implemented a high-price and high-interest rate policy as a mistake.

Although the high-price and high-interest rate policies began during the time when Zhang Gongquan was in charge of the Central Bank last year, they have not yet reached the level of the current Liu Gongyun. This is naturally created by the situation, but the basic reason lies in the different decisions of each individual. Today, the Central Bank holds a not insignificant amount of gold, foreign exchange, silver, and silver dollars, and also controls a huge amount of funds. Therefore, on the one hand, it uses the principle of financial commodities leading prices, and on the other hand, it uses funds as a tool to expand and contract credit. Therefore, no matter what it does in the market, it will never fall behind others. At the same time, it can use high-interest rates to increase the burden on bulls and use the surplus to subsidize the fiscal deficit. For example, the "44" harvest reached a huge amount of 4 billion gold yuan, which is certainly a gratifying thing for fiscal purposes.

However, when we examine the current situation, the impact of high prices and high-interest rates on people's lives in recent years is not small. If we deepen their extent further, not only will the people be in deeper water and fire, but it will also accelerate the collapse of the gold yuan and increase the fiscal burden. Moreover, even if there is a net income of 4 billion yuan every day, it is not enough to cover the monthly expenditure of 800 billion yuan (the above refers to the situation in April). The government is originally an institution that guarantees the people's livelihood and has the obligation to promote employment and stabilize prices. If everyone is reduced to starvation, what is the government's purpose and intention? What is the government's future and future? Politicians should have a long-term vision and must not be short-sighted and lose the hearts of the people. Moreover, between high prices and high-interest rates, it is still beneficial to vested interest groups.

Furthermore, the interest rate is originally a price for using funds. Its profit must exceed or track prices. Under high prices, it will certainly not fall. At the same time, the interest rate is one of the costs of prices and also one of the factors that determine prices. Once the interest rate is high, in order to maintain its own costs and obtain considerable profits, industry and commerce must of course adjust prices from time to time to compensate for losses. This phenomenon is always cyclical. Take the situation in the market last week as an example. The daily interbank lending rate created a new high of three to four hundred yuan, and prices also rose to a new peak of five to six percent every day (especially for oil, rice, and other items). Can ordinary people bear such a heavy burden?

There is one more point worth noting about the role of the Central Bank's use of the high-price policy. That is, after the government sells at high prices, it can recover most of the gold yuan, creating a tight credit situation and raising interest rates. This policy is correct in principle, but it is very different when looking at the current facts in our country. The most important factor is that the expenditure of the national treasury is too large, and a large amount of hot money is outside the financial circle and does not go through the bank's relationship. Therefore, although the items sold recently are many and the prices are high, the Central Bank still does not have the ability to control the market, only causing price disturbances.

We have seen the chaotic phenomenon in the market recently, which has lost the law of supply and demand, which is enough to prove that it is artificial self-disturbance. Therefore, we are very worried about the future of prices and the trend of interest rates. We deeply hope that the competent authorities should immediately put aside the financial objectives and, based solely on objective factors, weigh the gains and losses between the country and the people and make a new decision on prices and interest rates. The people have suffered a lot in recent years, and their lives cannot withstand another blow.

### US Senate and House Committees Complete Foreign Aid Compromise Bill, Aid to China Not Listed as Separate Bill

### Acheson Writes to Connally, Explains US Policy Toward China

Substantial Aid Inevitably Hides Potential Dangers

[United Press, Providence, Rhode Island, 14th] The Providence Journal quoted Washington correspondent Collins as saying that US Secretary of State Acheson wrote to Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stating that continuing to provide the Chinese government with substantial military or economic aid inevitably hides potential dangers. This letter was in response to Connally's inquiry about the State Department's attitude toward Senator McCarran's proposal to extend a $1.5 billion loan to China. Acheson strongly implied in the letter that there is currently no government in China that can implement a substantial military and economic aid program. The United States' true military intent requires a large number of US troops to actually fight, which would directly involve the United States in the Chinese civil war, not only violating its traditional policy toward China but also violating American interests. McCarran's proposal seeks to have the US government embark on an undertaking whose final cost is so enormous that it is difficult to predict, but the result will undoubtedly be a disaster.

### Last Shipment of Gold Yuan to Changsha, Many Disputes Over Conversion to Silver Dollars

Provincial Bank Subsidiary Coin Coupons Now Launched

[This Newspaper, Changsha, 14th] Disputes over the conversion of gold yuan to silver dollars have spread to Changsha. Most stores in the Changnanmen area of Changsha were closed on the 14th. In the evening, all stores in the city closed early, with a bleak scene and people in panic. The price of silver dollars has broken the 100,000 mark. Subsidiary coin coupons issued by the Provincial Bank, divided into one-jiao, two-jiao, and five-jiao denominations, will be launched on the 15th for the one-jiao and two-jiao denominations. The five-jiao denomination will be delayed until the first of next month due to printing issues. Because of the difficulty in supplementing the gold yuan conversion rate, the municipal government decided to issue fractional tickets to supplement it. This move is equivalent to stating that the Xiang authorities advocate not using gold yuan. Merchants in the market have already refused to accept gold yuan, regarding it as waste paper. After the subsidiary coin coupons are launched, the circulation of gold yuan will become more difficult, inevitably leading to a complete refusal to use it. The Xiang authorities previously ordered that all merchandise be priced in silver dollars, and now they are issuing subsidiary coin coupons, and these coupons are not interoperable with gold yuan, which is like adding fuel to the fire. Commentators are all sweating for them.

### Ministry of Education Negotiates with Ministry of Finance; Expediting Allocation of Funds to Various Universities

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] It is rumored that national universities in Shanghai have significantly better employee compensation than universities in other provinces.

The Executive Yuan instructed the Ministry of Finance to quickly release the funds due to the universities. Recently, universities in Shanghai have received salaries for March and April, as well as overdrafts based on the new March standards. Some universities in Shanghai, sympathizing with the difficult living conditions of their employees, have diverted the overdraft funds to provide advances. Based on the above situation, the Ministry of Education has contacted the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank to request the early release of funds due to universities in other regions, so that employee compensation across the country is not significantly different.

### Hunan Military Leaders Meet; Exchange Views on Xiangxi Problem; In Principle, There Will Be No Hasty Military Action

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 14th] A section of the Xiangxi rebel forces has once again moved south from the Yongshun border, reaching 炊宿 (Chuisu) on the 13th, engaging in combat with blocking troops. Another section is advancing towards Luxi. The rebels claim that they wronged the people of Yuanling last time and will not enter the city this time, but will bypass the city to the east, directly towards Changtao. Yuanling currently has two regiments from the Second Security Brigade, as well as two regiments from the Fifth Security Brigade established by Yan Wuxin, commander of the Yuanling Garrison. Although newly formed, the quality of Yuanling's civilian militias is not weak. The people of Yuanling suffered greatly last time and are now quite motivated, preparing to resist strongly. Senior military officials in the province held a meeting on the evening of the 13th to exchange views on the renewed Xiangxi unrest. In principle, there will be no hasty military action, and a political solution will still be the primary focus. Chen Quzhen, the "King of Xiangxi," is old and had no intention of causing unrest. It is said that the reason he accepted the endorsement this time was because Zhang Yulin, who was incorporated in Chenxi, had a blood feud with Chen over his father's death. Chen feared revenge from Zhang and took this action for self-preservation, leading the "heroes" of leaderless Xiangxi to have a united "leader."

### Indonesia Insists on Restoring the Republic First; Dutch-Indonesian Negotiations Reach Another Stalemate; Cochran Urges Both Sides to Reach an Agreement

[United Press, Batavia, 13th] Dutch and Indonesian representatives met here on the night of the 13th to renegotiate the bloody dispute over Java and Sumatra, but a dispute arose before the negotiations even began. Roem, chairman of the Indonesian Republic delegation, told United Press during the meeting that the first step in the negotiations was to restore the Indonesian Republic. However, Van Royen, chairman of the Dutch delegation, immediately replied that accepting such a condition was "out of the question." Roem and Van Royen only agreed on one point: the hope of a successful resolution was extremely slim. Roem stated that they could not make effective decisions on a ceasefire or participation in the Hague Conference until the government was restored and contact was established with party leaders, guerrilla commanders, and parliamentary leaders.

[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 14th] Representatives of the Netherlands and Indonesia met again here on the 14th at a round table conference for the first time since the Dutch military action against the Indonesian Republic last December. The preliminary meeting held here was convened in accordance with the Security Council's directive of March 23. The meeting was held at the Hotel Indonesia in Batavia and began at 10:45 am on the 14th. It was chaired by Cochran, the American representative on the United Nations Commission for Indonesia. The meeting lasted about an hour and then adjourned, to be reconvened on the 16th. In his opening remarks, Cochran mentioned the Security Council's directive of March 23 to cease guerrilla warfare and restore the Republican government in Yogyakarta, stating: If this condition is fulfilled, then Indonesia's participation in the Hague Round Table Conference will undoubtedly be achieved with friendly understanding. Cochran also stated that the duration of the current consultations had not yet been decided and that both sides must immediately dispel misunderstandings and quickly reach a resolution to the Indonesian issue. Cochran concluded by calling on both sides to restore reason, tolerance, and careful consideration. After Chairman Cochran's remarks, Van Royen, head of the Dutch delegation, rose to speak, stating that the Dutch delegation would first discuss the issue of the return of the Republican government to Yogyakarta, but that a prerequisite for discussing this issue was that Indonesia must first agree to stop guerrilla warfare and allow participation in the Hague Round Table Conference. Van Royen also emphasized that Dutch sovereignty over Indonesia and the United States of Indonesia must be fully and unconditionally recognized. He denied that the Dutch-Indonesian Federation would appear in the form of the Netherlands as a supreme state. He stated that this federation would include two equal members with equal rights, so the United States of Indonesia could not expect to enjoy more rights than the Netherlands. Roem, head of the Indonesian delegation, then spoke, stating that Indonesia would never agree to a partial implementation of the Security Council's resolution. He declared that only after an agreement on the restoration of the Indonesian Republican government was reached and implemented could other comprehensive solutions to the Indonesian issue be considered. He also solemnly stated that important decisions on this matter would then be taken based on public opinion.

### Argentina Plans to Suggest to the UN General Assembly; Abolishing the Great Powers' Veto Power; The Soviet Union Vigorously Criticizes the Atlantic Treaty

[Our Dispatch] New York, 14th Radio: Flushing News: After participating in the Small Nations Group meeting to discuss the veto issue, the Argentine representative stated in the UN General Assembly that Argentina will insist on convening a special session to amend the UN Charter, even if opposing countries threaten to leave the UN. He said, "I personally do not wish to see any country leave the United Nations, but if the actions of any member state are sufficient to cause the division or failure of the United Nations, then I have no intention of retaining it."

[United Press, New York, 13th] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko spoke at a plenary session of the UN General Assembly today, attacking the signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty for conspiring to launch an atomic war against the Soviet Union. Gromyko said that the signatory countries of the treaty are taking extensive military measures that are unrelated to their own national defense interests. In particular, the United States, Britain, and France are actively engaged in an arms race and are drafting plans to attack the Soviet Union, including the use of atomic weapons. The form of the North Atlantic Treaty proves that a new military and political bloc on both sides of the Atlantic is targeting the Soviet Union. Since the Soviet Union is the only major power outside the treaty, it is self-evident that the treaty's purpose is to counter the Soviet Union. This treaty undermines the foundation of the UN organization, but the Soviet Union will continue to uphold the principles of the Charter. Britain and the United States are establishing bases in areas near the Soviet Union. No one believes that Norway's participation in the treaty is for peaceful purposes. If a major power thousands of miles away were to establish air bases in Mexico, how would the United States react? It is obvious that the Soviet Union has not threatened any of the signatory countries with any attacks.

Earlier, US representative Austin stated that the North Atlantic Treaty has no aggressive intentions and is consistent with the principles of the UN Charter. The Soviet Union has abused its veto power in the Security Council as many as thirty times, causing member states to lose confidence in the Security Council's peace efforts. Austin advocated listing thirty-four items on the General Assembly agenda as procedural matters, not subject to veto power. Chinese representative Xu Yuqi seconded the motion, but stated that the fundamental solution lies in completely abolishing the veto power. Regarding this point, Gromyko replied that the US and British governments' position on the veto issue can only be correctly understood within the scope of their general policy, which aims to establish military and political blocs and pursue goals that are completely inconsistent with the UN Charter.

### Israel's Application for Membership; Referred to the UN General Assembly's Political Committee for Review; Agreement Reached in Israeli-Syrian Armistice Negotiations

[United Press, New York, 13th] The United Nations General Assembly voted 31 to 18 today, with 7 abstentions, to refer Israel's application for membership to the 58-nation Political Committee for review, thwarting hopes for Israel's early admission. The General Assembly had once included Israel's application on the agenda of this session, but then rescinded the original decision.

[Agence France-Presse, Damascus, 13th] As a result of armistice negotiations held here between Israeli and Syrian representatives, an agreement has been reached today.

### Suggestion to Conclude a Military Agreement with South Korea; The US Government Is Studying It; Korea Hopes for the US to Equip Over 200,000 Army, Navy, and Air Force Personnel

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The US State Department and the Army Department are currently studying South Korea's proposal to conclude a military agreement, similar in nature to the US-Greek military agreement. The detailed plan was presented to Secretary of State Acheson by Chung Huan-bum, the South Korean representative to the United States. Chung also discussed it with Army Undersecretary Devers. According to Chung, South Korea hopes to obtain sufficient arms and equipment to establish six infantry divisions of approximately 100,000 men, a reserve force of 50,000 men, and a police force of 50,000 men. In addition, it needs 100 aircraft of various types and equipment for 3,000 airmen. The Navy needs over 50 ships and weapons and equipment for 10,000 sailors.

### Yoshida Hopes to Conclude Individual Agreements with Various Countries; The Result Is Equivalent to Concluding a Peace Treaty

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida hopes to establish "piecemeal" agreements on various issues, which will then accumulate into a peace treaty. Yoshida stated in the House of Representatives yesterday that while the government still hopes to conclude a peace treaty as soon as possible, it also hopes to establish temporary agreements on various issues, the result of which may be equivalent to concluding a peace treaty. Yoshida also stated frankly in response to questions from the House of Representatives Budget Committee that the Japanese government has no intention of amending the new constitution.

### A Strong Earthquake Occurs in the Northwestern United States; Houses Collapse and Roads Crack Everywhere

[United Press, Seattle, 13th] A strong earthquake occurred this afternoon in a vast area of the Pacific Northwest, including Washington State and British Columbia. At least five people have died, many have been injured, and property damage amounts to millions of dollars. The Washington State Capitol in Olympia was damaged in eight places, killing two people. A child died in Tacoma, a student was seriously injured in Stone Palace, and one person died in Centralia. The worst of the earthquake was at Puget Sound. Many eaves were shaken off in Seattle, and bricks, stones, beams, and wood fell into the streets, and many walls, windows, and water pipes were cracked. All the police were dispatched for rescue, and fire trucks and ambulances roared and rushed about. The elevators were packed with people fleeing their homes. Countless people in Seattle, Portland, Tacoma, Olympia, and many other cities fled their shaking homes, and many were injured by falling eaves. The Olympia State Capitol and major insurance companies were ordered to close, and all students in the schools were evacuated. In Tacoma, a section of a street cracked for 1,000 yards, and the entire front of a building in Centralia collapsed into the street. Two water tanks on the roof in Seattle were cracked, and water poured down like a waterfall.

### US Atomic Bomb Production; One Can Be Manufactured Per Week

### The US House of Representatives Approves a New Military Budget After Heated Debate; Cannon Stresses the Need to Expedite the Production of Aircraft Carrying Atomic Bombs

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The House of Representatives today passed a $16 billion military budget after a heated debate, sending it to the Senate for discussion. This is the largest peacetime military expenditure in American history. Democratic Congressman Cannon frankly declared that once a war with the Soviet Union breaks out, US bomber fleets must crush every Soviet military center within the first three weeks.

After the signing of the Atlantic Treaty, we have obtained bases everywhere. Currently, we only need aircraft to transport atomic bombs. Moscow and key areas of Soviet bases must be bombed within a week of the start of the war, otherwise the Soviet Union will sweep across Europe within sixty days. Cannon defended his proposal to reduce funding for the Navy's aviation forces under the House Appropriations Committee, stating that once a war breaks out, it will be Air Force bomber squadrons, not Navy aircraft, that will carry atomic bombs to Moscow. Congressman Vinson, chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, defended the $300 million additional budget for the Navy's aviation forces, stating that the Appropriations Committee has cut off the Navy's lifeline.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] The US Army and Air Force are currently at odds over the construction of a new 67,000-ton aircraft carrier, with intense debate. The government has already allocated $10 million for the construction of the ship. The Navy Department argues that it should continue construction as a mobile base for heavy bombers to drop atomic bombs. However, the Air Force Department believes that the existing 36 Superfortress bombers can bomb anywhere in the world from domestic bases, so building a mobile base is a waste of money and useless.

### The Plan to Revive West Germany Announced; Easing Industrial Restrictions and Restoring Shipbuilding Industry; The Decision Not to Dismantle 159 Factories

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 13th] British Military Governor Robertson and US Military Governor Clay convened a meeting today with leaders from the German economic and financial sectors to discuss the steps for the British and American joint zones to participate in the European Recovery Program.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] The United States, Britain, and France announced today a plan to revive West Germany, lifting or easing restrictions on the shipbuilding industry and other industries, while deciding to remove 159 factories from the list of German dismantling, retaining them for the purpose of increasing German production.

The purpose of this move is twofold: (1) to accelerate West Germany's economic self-sufficiency; (2) to enable Germans to contribute more to general European recovery. According to the new agreement, West Germany can restore various important industries that were previously prohibited, such as the manufacture of aluminum, vanadium, ball bearings, ships, light machinery, synthetic ammonia, heavy tractors, and commercial radio transceivers. The manufacture of military weapons, munitions, synthetic gasoline, synthetic rubber, magnesium, and radioactive materials remains prohibited. The list of 159 factories exempted from dismantling was released by the State Department and the Economic Cooperation Administration. The list includes 32 steel mills, 88 woodworking factories, 32 chemical plants, and 7 non-ferrous metal plants. In the future, Germany can manufacture cargo ships and oil tankers of less than 7,200 tons, with a maximum speed of 12 knots per hour. The Potsdam Agreement only allowed Germany to manufacture ships of less than 1,500 tons. In the future, Germany can also purchase 100,000 tons of oil tankers and 30,000 tons of dry cargo ships from foreign countries, but ocean liners may not be manufactured. In the future, aluminum production will be limited to 85,000 tons per year.

### British, American, and Dutch People Plan to Search for; Relics of Noah's Ark

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] The American Geographical Society announced today that the United States does not intend to formally organize an expedition to Mount Ararat in Turkey to survey the relics of Noah's Ark. Mount Ararat is a military area close to the borders of Iran, Turkey, and the Soviet Union. The report in Moscow's Pravda that the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands plan to use the expedition to send spies to the area is completely untrue. In fact, only American explorer Heys and 19-year-old Dutch youth Lawson plan to join the expedition led by Englishman Six. Previously, Kurdish natives discovered a remnant shell similar to Noah's Ark in a cave on the slopes of Mount Ararat, hence this action.

### Already Decided and Undecided Political Prisoners: Ordered to Be Released on Bail Within One Week; District Attorney's Office Rushing to Process Overnight

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal District Court and its Prosecutor's Office recently received a telegram from the Supreme Court Prosecutor's Office, relaying instructions from the Ministry of Judicial Administration. This concerned those already convicted of offenses under the "Emergency Decree Punishing Crimes Against the State During the Period of Suppression of Rebellion" who are now eligible for release on bail according to the amended "Temporary Measures for Aiding Robbers in Extraordinary Times." It also tasked guarantors with proper supervision and guidance. This measure was submitted to and passed by the 52nd Executive Yuan Political Affairs Meeting and ordered to be implemented by the Executive Yuan on April 7th. The amended measures and the separately issued "Points to Note Regarding the Release on Bail of Convicted Political Prisoners" were attached. All levels of procuratorial organs, higher courts of provinces and cities, high court branch courts, and prisons were ordered to, within three days of receiving the document, have the chief prosecutor of the location, together with the court president, supervise the responsible personnel of the prisons to investigate and list the convicted political prisoners, and release them on bail within one week. For those undecided political prisoners who had previously been ordered to be released on bail, if there were any still detained, they should also be jointly investigated and listed by the competent authorities within the aforementioned time limit and released on bail, and the handling situation should be reported without delay. After receiving the order, the court and prosecutor's office have already begun to handle the matter.

Chief Prosecutor Zhang Yuquan and spokesperson Xu Chengde of the District Attorney's Office, in order to handle the matter of releasing convicted political prisoners on bail, received the press at the office yesterday afternoon to report on the progress and answer reporters' questions. The following is a summary: (1) After receiving the telegram order the day before yesterday, the office rushed to print all the documents overnight and sent them to the relevant agencies for investigation and handling. Because the number of convicted and undecided political prisoners detained in various places varied, it was hoped that they would reply quickly so that bail could be processed on schedule. The office has appointed two prosecutors, Chen Shoutao and Dao Zhou, to be responsible for handling the matter. (2) Those detained for violating martial law are not yet covered by explicit regulations and are not eligible for bail. (3) The government is determined to achieve peace with this order to handle the release of political prisoners on bail, and families do not need to ask anyone for help or even bribe anyone. (4) Families of detained political prisoners can apply directly to the court for bail. Agencies, schools, and organizations related to the prisoners can act as guarantors, without the need for commercial or monetary guarantees. (5) For political prisoners not detained in this city, their families should apply for bail to the detention agency where they are located. (6) There are currently more than forty political prisoners detained in Shanghai Prison.

### Postal, Telegraph, and Railway Price Hikes: Not Expected to Be Implemented Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] Postal, telegraph, and railway fares will not increase today. The Ministry of Transportation is still seriously considering the fee standards for the three state-run transportation sectors. Since the Canton-Hankow Railway used silver dollars as the base for freight rates, there has been much speculation about the new freight rates for the Peking-Shanghai Railway. In order to balance income and expenditure and achieve a permanent solution, the authorities of both railways are very interested in emulating the Canton-Hankow Railway's silver dollar pricing. However, in reality, it is feared that this will be difficult to achieve in the short term. However, if the cost-plus pricing method previously passed by the Legislative Yuan is restored, with monthly adjustments made three times according to a formula, the possibility is greater. The situation with postal and telegraph services is roughly the same. If calculated according to the formula previously set by the Ministry of Transportation, the new prices for railways, telegraphs, and postal services would all be more than ten times higher than the current prices. However, a sudden increase of ten times would inevitably affect prices and the people's purchasing power. This is the reason why the Ministry of Transportation has been unable to make a decision for so long. However, the financial deficits of these institutions urgently need to be made up, so the price increase is only a matter of time.

### To Make a Long-Distance Call to Peking or Tientsin: Application Procedures Must Be Completed First

(6) Those who do not have their own telephone but apply to make a call must go to the Telecommunications Bureau in person to make the call in order and must not borrow someone else's telephone. Violators will have their calls terminated.

### Workers at China Textile Factory No. 11 Clash Over Demand for Rice Distribution

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Textile Factory No. 11 in West Shanghai employs over a thousand male and female workers. Last winter, the factory stored a large quantity of rice to be distributed to workers in case of emergencies. Recently, due to the high cost of goods and the rising price of rice, all the workers demanded yesterday morning that the factory distribute one dou of rice per person and pay their salaries early. At the time, the factory thought that this matter should be resolved by the head office, and the workers immediately went on strike. By lunchtime, when the staff went to eat, they were all robbed by the labor side. Afterwards, the Putuo Road Police Station received a report, and the branch chief Shen Deheng personally led Zhu and other officers to rush to the scene to suppress the situation. They also persuaded the labor side to resume work as usual, and if there were any demands, they could elect representatives to discuss them with the head office to seek a reasonable solution. After 1:00 PM, all the workers resumed work and elected representatives to negotiate with the head office.

Most shipping companies find it difficult to maintain operations and hope that the government authorities will pay attention to this as soon as possible.

### Yangtze River Impassable: Two Ships Attacked by Artillery Fire; Request for Escort Unsuccessful

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yangtze River ships have been repeatedly bombarded, making them afraid to travel. The Shipping Association has repeatedly requested the dispatch of naval vessels for escort, but without success. Regular passenger ships going up and down the river have been suspended for half a month. Occasionally, cargo ships are attacked, resulting in damaged hulls and injured crew members, as previously reported. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Min" No. 306 ship, towing the "Li" No. 107 large iron barge, was shot at by the Communist army while traveling from Nanking to Shanghai, passing through the Yizheng River, and was hit by three shells. A large hole was blown in the side of the ship, and two crew members were injured. The two ships are now docked in Zhenjiang, and the captain returned to Shanghai yesterday to report to the head office. In addition, the Hong An Company's Dongshan ship, which was traveling from Shanghai to Huangshi Port, was shelled by both sides while passing through the West Liangshan River near Datong. Two shells hit, but fortunately no one was injured. After being frightened, some of the crew members abandoned ship and fled. Yesterday morning, more than thirty people arrived in Shanghai and made demands to the company. The company had already received a report from the captain, so it had sent more than ten people to the Dongshan ship the day before to sail it back to Shanghai. The company's other two ships, Mingxing and Ruitai, are said to be loading coal in Hankow and will soon return to Shanghai.

### Resolution of the Issue of Cash Salaries: National Bank Agrees to Two Methods; Manufacturers Can Exchange Gold for Silver Dollars for Payment

[Report from Our Newspaper] The cost of living index will be released today, and industry and commerce need a large amount of cash to pay employees' salaries. Last time, most of the salaries were paid in bank drafts, which employees had to exchange for cash at a discount of 10% to 20%, resulting in too much loss and frequent disputes. In order to prevent such incidents from happening again, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau and representatives from more than ten groups, including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, the General Labor Union, the Silver and Money Trade Association, China Textile Corporation, and the Cotton Spinning Association, including Ouyang Lun and Zhou Xuexiang, visited Lin Chongyong, director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, yesterday morning at 10:00 AM and made two requests: (1) Please issue 100 billion in cash before the 18th of this month. (2) If it is not possible to issue all cash, please issue silver dollars as well. After detailed research, two methods were decided:

(1) The size of the cost of living index to be released at noon today cannot be predicted, so the amount of cash to be prepared for salary payment cannot be determined. However, the principle is that cash will account for 50% of the total amount. (2) The issuing of silver dollars will be modified to use as many silver dollars as possible. That is, it is stipulated that one tael of gold can be exchanged for 48 Yuan silver dollars. If industrial and commercial firms need to pay salaries in silver dollars, they can entrust banks and members of the Gold Trade Association to exchange gold for Yuan silver dollars at the National Bank. The above methods were approved by Director Lin and resolved by noon.

Difference in Price Between Yuan Silver Dollars and Other Foreign Silver Dollars: Director of Social Affairs Bureau Considers it Unreasonable

Director Cao of the Social Affairs Bureau told reporters yesterday that after the monthly cost of living index is released, silver dollars flourish and their prices rise accordingly. Employees suffer greatly from exploitation in the process of buying and selling silver dollars. Silver dollar dealers make a lot of profit, and prices also rise. He hoped that silver dollar dealers would have a conscience and cease operations for a few days, and not push silver dollar prices too high. Director Cao also said that the price of Yuan silver dollars is too high, while the prices of other miscellaneous silver dollars differ greatly, while their actual fineness is almost the same. This is an unreasonable phenomenon. He intends to suggest to the financial authorities that if the prices of various silver dollars cannot be uniformly regulated, a reasonable ratio should be set, and the difference should not be too great, in order to gradually bring them into line.

Since the devaluation of the Gold Yuan, some shops in this city have been pricing in Yuan silver dollars or US dollars. The Social Affairs Bureau believes that the Gold Yuan is the national legal tender, and all transactions should still be based on the Gold Yuan. Pricing in Yuan silver dollars or foreign currencies is prohibited by law. Yesterday, it ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to instruct its members to strictly prohibit this practice.

Results of Testing Various Silver Coins: Little Difference in Weight and Fineness

### Three Pawnshops Cracked Down on for Drug Trafficking; Thirteen Suspects Arrested and Sent for Handling

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Detective Division of the Police Bureau recently cracked a major drug case, arresting thirteen suspects and confiscating more than twenty taels of opium and more than thirty taels of heroin. If calculated at current prices, the value is about a hundred taels of gold. The case was only completed yesterday and was transferred to the District Court for handling in the afternoon. The head of the division, Gan Jue, received a tip on April 4th that Ma Jie, the owner of Yongfeng Pawnshop in Qishan Village, Jiangsu Road, Yu Yuan Road, was using the pawnshop as a cover to engage in the sale of opium and other drugs, and that he himself was heavily addicted to opium. The anti-drug police officers were ordered to go to the address to arrest Ma and, together with the head of the neighborhood, found a dish of opium paste, opium pipes, and opium ash in his small room on the third floor. While searching, Ma Wenda tried to enter Ma's house but, upon discovering police officers, looked flustered and tried to turn around and escape. The police officers chased him out and arrested him, finding a package of opium on his person. After interrogation, he confessed that the opium was entrusted to him by Ma and purchased from Jinxing Pawnshop at 35 Yingxun Road, Nanshi. In addition to taking the two suspects to the bureau, the police officers escorted Ma Wenda to the above location that afternoon and arrested He Yongde, Zhou Yinbo, Zheng Bingwu, Wang Weixin, and other four people. At the same time, a bag of heroin was found in the writing desk, fifteen bags of heroin were found in the toilet wall, and twelve bags of opium, weighing more than twenty taels, were found in the pawned clothing room. They were immediately taken to the bureau for questioning, and police officers were sent to wait until 7:00 PM, when three more accomplices, Fang Xiao, Bao Qingyuan, and Fan Sihao, were arrested. Later, according to He Yongde's confession, the heroin was purchased from Ke Chengchen on the upper floor of Hecheng Pawnshop at 922 Minguo Road. Police officers were sent to arrest Ke and continued to find a suspect named Huang Wen at the location. On the morning of the 8th, according to the confessions of the arrested criminals, Zheng Yongmu was arrested at 29 Jingu Road, and 17 taels of heroin and an opium addict named Ye Bingyou were found.

### Lu Tianyou Sentenced to Imprisonment for Transporting Military Supplies to Northern Jiangsu; Boatman Zhou Tiangen Granted Bail

[Report from Our Newspaper] Lu Tianyou, a native of Qidong, previously opened a general merchandise store in his hometown. Two years ago, Qidong was captured by the Communists, Lu fled to Shanghai, and operated a tofu shop at 22 Tongfu Lane, Zhoujiazui Road. He also worked as a broker, introducing buyers and sellers for single-item transactions and earning commissions. In August of last year, he was introduced by his fellow villagers Chen Xiaota, Weng Dasheng, and Huang Ximing to purchase picric acid, an industrial raw material, to be transported to Northern Jiangsu for sale. Unexpectedly, when it was delivered to the ship, it was seized by the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. The picric acid was identified as a raw material for explosives, and 1,938 carbine bullets, 1,189 Thompson submachine gun bullets, and about 40 pounds of finished explosives were also found on the same ship. The authorities considered that he intended to transport military supplies to Northern Jiangsu. At that time, Chen and the boat owner had already fled, so Lu and the boatman Zhou Tiangen were detained and sent to the Special Criminal Court. Later, the Special Criminal Court was ordered to be abolished, and the case was transferred to the District Attorney's Office for investigation and prosecution. Yesterday, the District Court opened the trial and sentenced Lu to one year and four months in prison. Zhou was granted bail.

The day before yesterday afternoon, he and more than ten relatives and friends were playing Russian Pai Gow at his residence. At around 8:00 PM, while they were having dinner, two thugs suddenly appeared, one wearing a yellow uniform and the other wearing a black police uniform with a police hat. They claimed to be checking household registrations and ordered everyone to show their identification cards. Then, three more people arrived, all carrying guns, knives, and other weapons. They threatened and intimidated the more than twenty people in the house, driving them into a room. One robber stood guard outside with a gun, while the others forced Wang's brother-in-law, Zhou Dehua, to hand over the key to the safe, which they looted at will. They stole fourteen large gold bars (weighing 140 taels), nine Hong Kong gold bars (each weighing five taels), five small gold bars, more than twenty gold rings, twelve pairs of gold bracelets, 410 US dollars, two gem-inlaid rings, three gold rings, four taels of old gold jewelry, one filigree gold bracelet, one woman's watch, several diamond rings, and two gold bracelets pledged by guests.

### Gang Robbery on a Junk, Two Criminals Sentenced to Life Imprisonment

[Report from this newspaper] Wang Hongtao and Lu Mupu, in collusion with Jin Xiaoxiang and Jin Xiaokou (who are still at large), sailed Jin Xiaokou's father's boat on October 4th of last year, carrying eight fake guns and eight Mauser pistols. They robbed a Shanghai-Ningbo junk off the coast of Wusongkou, stealing more than 700 catties of salt, 3.6 million yuan in legal tender, and two triangular sails. Then, on the 10th of the same month, they jointly sailed the boat to rob again, obtaining more than 700 catties of salt and two triangular sails. They were arrested by the Songhu Garrison Command, and the stolen goods were transferred to the Special Criminal Court at that time. Later, as the Special Criminal Court was ordered to be abolished, they were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. Subsequently, the District Court ruled that although Wang and Lu both denied the charges during the trial, they could not provide favorable evidence to the contrary. Considering that their crimes were somewhat pardonable, they were each sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of their civil rights for life.

### Strange Incident on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line: Express Train Derails but Still Arrives Safely

[Report from this newspaper] Another miracle of a train derailing and then automatically jumping back onto the tracks occurred at the North Station in this city yesterday. The No. 24 express train from Hangzhou to Shanghai on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line, which included first, second, and third class cars, was passing the double-track turnout at No. 43 Yangqi Station outside the North Station at 11:35 AM when the front two wheels of the third car, a second-class carriage, suddenly derailed. In an instant, they automatically jumped back onto the tracks. About half a minute later, the two wheels derailed again. Just as the driver was about to brake, the derailed two wheels jumped back onto the tracks again. The train finally arrived safely at the station at 11:40 AM on time. After inspection, the sleepers were slightly damaged by the steel wheels, and the wheels were also slightly chipped. The Road Bureau's Engineering Department and Locomotive Department immediately sent personnel to the North Station to repair and investigate. It is said that this situation is called "jumping the tracks" in railway terminology, which is caused by the vibration of the undercarriage. However, the Road Bureau is still investigating the cause of the undercarriage vibration and it is difficult to answer at this time.

### The Municipal Police Bureau Rectifies Discipline, Strictly Deals with Corrupt Police Officers Who Accept Gifts

[Report from this newspaper] Zheng Tingxian, the director of the Criminal Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, noted that some criminal police officers under his command sometimes used their authority to accept gifts from parties involved in cases during or after the investigation, which was tantamount to bribery. After sending personnel for secret investigation, he has discovered several cases. In addition to detaining and severely punishing the derelict personnel, he also hopes that citizens will report such cases at any time. In addition, there are some unscrupulous people who take advantage of their familiarity with personnel and even solicit criminal cases. Those who have been caught, such as Shen Lianfang and others, were transferred to the court for questioning yesterday.

### Police and Robbers Exchange Fire on Huangxing Road, Two Criminals Finally Captured

As a result, Wei Kui and Lu Yiqing were captured, and the others escaped into the darkness. After being taken to the bureau for interrogation, they confessed to committing several robberies. They are currently being questioned in detail.

### Engineer's Wife Dies by Poisoning

After being discovered, she was rushed to Fangji Hospital for emergency treatment, but it was ineffective, and she died at 7:00 AM yesterday.

### To Maintain the Domestic Kerosene Industry, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables the Executive Yuan Again to Allocate Diesel Fuel or Stipulate Import Quotas for Each Factory

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly cabled the Executive Yuan requesting the allocation of diesel fuel for the domestic kerosene industry, but no approval has been received. It has asked for prompt instructions, saying: Previously, according to a letter from the Oil and Grease Trade Association, the Export-Import Management Committee's Import Quota Allocation Office and the Gasoline Allocation Committee had formulated two measures for supplying diesel fuel for the domestic kerosene industry. Suddenly, citing the disparity between supply and demand, they requested instructions from the Executive Yuan. The case has been suspended for several months and is about to be interrupted. Therefore, it has repeatedly telegraphed, requesting approval for the allocation to be implemented. It stated that the source of raw materials for the oil refining industry in Shanghai has been cut off, and it has had to seek it on the black market for more than half a year, but no reply has been received, which is deeply alarming. Even if the Executive Yuan is said to be handling numerous affairs every day, the organization is large and each has its own responsibilities. The people's requests should be considered, so why is it so delayed? Recently, it has learned that the Guangzhou Kerosene Industry Association also has a case requesting the approval of diesel raw materials for each oil refinery. The Executive Yuan issued a notification to the Export-Import Management Committee for review and direct reply. The Export-Import Management Committee said that the import of oil depends entirely on US aid, and the amount and use are determined by the US Economic Cooperation Administration, and that the import of kerosene under US aid is sufficient for domestic needs, using this as an excuse to postpone it. This is tantamount to supporting the patent of foreign imported kerosene and not allowing domestic kerosene to compete with it, which is contrary to the overall principle. What the Chamber of Commerce cannot understand is that supporting industry is a fixed government policy, but requests for the allocation of raw materials have not been approved for more than half a year. The same request from the Guangzhou Kerosene Industry Association has even been transferred to the Export-Import Management Committee for review, while the request from the Shanghai Oil and Grease Industry is completely silent. The comparison between the two makes Shanghai merchants feel even more lamented. The Chamber of Commerce is responsible for forwarding the request, and it cannot avoid being blamed and cannot explain itself. It has been found that the Kaohsiung Oil Refinery in Taiwan has diesel fuel imported for manufacturing kerosene, and Hong Kong also has abundant reserves, coming from Iran, Britain, and Russia, not solely relying on US aid. The Guangzhou oil refining industry requested diesel fuel imports to avoid the threat of high prices on the black market, and did not insist that the government allocate it, truly understanding the limited amount of US aid to avoid endless litigation. If the government neither allocates diesel fuel nor approves the diesel fuel import quotas for each factory so that they can purchase it from abroad on their own, then the kerosene refining industry will either have to seek it from the black market at high prices, or it will have to close down and stop operating. The former is equivalent to the government encouraging the black market, and the latter is equivalent to the government rewarding foreign goods, which is probably not the government's consistent proposition of protecting industry. It is hoped that the Executive Yuan will review the two methods of allocating diesel fuel or approving the diesel fuel import quotas for each factory so that they can purchase it from abroad on their own, and approve one of them as soon as possible so that the industry can maintain production.

### Long Yun Unanimously Criticized by Hong Kong Press While Behind the Iron Curtain

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Jian Zi

[Air Mail from this Newspaper, Hong Kong, 12th] Long Yun held a press conference at his residence in Repulse Bay on the afternoon of the 11th, creating a sensational news story in Hong Kong. It wasn't because of the content of his speech, but because his son refused Chinese and Western reporters entry, and even attempted to imprison a reporter, reenacting his good show of imprisoning innocent people in Kunming! As a result, righteous newspapers in Hong Kong unanimously attacked Long Yun's "residual warlord power" like a volley of cannon fire. Long Yun's press conference can truly be described as "seeing the harm before the benefit."

Fifth Young Master Long Imprisons Reporter

According to the "Overseas Chinese Daily," "Long Yun, who governed Yunnan for more than ten years, has been secretly sneaking into Hong Kong from Nanjing since last month, and has been living the life of an overseas exile in a sophisticated villa at No. 177 Xiangdao, Repulse Bay. His third and fifth sons are by his side. After arriving in Hong Kong, Long Yun is still secretly engaged in political activities. Recently, taking advantage of the rapid downturn in the domestic situation, he has adopted a 'wait and see' attitude, negotiating with Nanjing and Beiping, attempting to make a comeback, hoping to return to Kunming one day and relive his old dreams. Recently, the negotiation has probably been completed and there are signs of progress. At 12:30 AM the night before (the 10th), he sent telegrams to various newspapers here, inviting reporters to come and announce something, etc. Reporters from various newspapers arrived at Long's villa at No. 177 Xiangdao one after another at 4:00 PM yesterday to await the invitation. Only reporters from the Huashang, Wenhui, and Ta Kung Pao newspapers were entertained. The remaining twenty or so reporters from the newspaper, as well as the Hong Kong Commercial Daily, Cheng Bao, the South China Morning Post, the Central News Agency, the Associated Press, and the Times, were all refused entry. The surroundings were filled with burly men who gave resentful glances when the reporters expressed their intentions, their demeanor fierce, which made people surprised. After repeated negotiations by this newspaper's reporter, Chen Zhihua, he was finally allowed to enter alone. Everyone thought that this would allow them to negotiate with Long. Unexpectedly, as soon as Chen Zhihua stepped through the door, Long Yun's fifth son, Long Shengxun, repeatedly said that he wanted to imprison Chen. Chen tried to explain, but Long Shengxun pushed Chen to the ground without explanation. Seeing the dangerous situation at the time, Chen pushed open the window in the prison room and shouted for help. The reporters who were refused entry were extremely angry and indignant upon hearing the cries for help. Fearing that things would escalate, they immediately called the Stanley Police Station, requesting them to send someone to protect them. After receiving the report, the police station immediately sent one Chinese police officer to the scene, but the burly men closed the door and refused to let the Chinese police officer in. Then, Stanley Police Station Assistant Superintendent Ho Lun Shi and three Chinese police officers arrived in a police car to investigate, but the burly men still wanted to refuse entry. After Assistant Superintendent Ho Lun Shi scolded them, they finally opened the door. Chen Zhihua was then free to move around. At that time, Long Shengxun still wanted to fabricate a story, but Assistant Superintendent Ho Lun Shi ignored him and took a statement back to the Stanley Police Station for filing. It was also heard that Long Yun sent a letter from Hong Kong to Acting President Li Zongren on the 10th and asked him to forward it to President He Yingqin, urging Li and He to resolutely and unconditionally accept the eight surrender conditions proposed by Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party, and instructing the Beijing representatives to make concrete decisions and implement them immediately according to the conditions. Long tried his best to show his 'democracy,' but before the ink was dry, he unreasonably imprisoned reporters, fully demonstrating the style of a warlord."

Unpleasant Events Attempt to Cover Up

The above news account has vividly described the "style" of the Long family. The reporters who were favored by Long Yun and allowed to enter the hall included those from the Ta Kung Pao, Wenhui, Huashang Xingdao, Xinsheng, and Huachao newspapers, as well as one reporter each from Agence France-Presse and United Press, a total of seventeen people. Although the Overseas Chinese Daily was invited, its reporter was almost locked up by Long's fifth son. Fortunately, he struggled to get up and shouted for help, otherwise this incident might have had even more shocking consequences!

Apart from the Overseas Chinese Daily, those newspapers that were "favored" did not record a single word about this "unpleasant incident" performed by the Long family, only Xingdao "supported the cloud and held the moon" in the lines. However, "unpleasant events" often attempt to cover up, and even with clever faces, it is impossible to hide the past. The Hong Kong Commercial Daily pointed out that the Long family was "arrogant and rude" and said that Long Yun "mentioned the Kunming Incident again and again," fully exposing that "old evils" had never been forgotten, taking the opportunity to retaliate…

Shallow Water in the Bay, Difficult to Stir Up Storms

The Hong Kong Commercial Evening News added a headline "Strange News of Inviting Reporters! The Long Mansion Sets Up an Iron Curtain" to this news, teasing it extremely. Cheng Bao said, "Long Yun wants to turn left. Yesterday he invited reporters and then imprisoned them. How can shallow water in the bay stir up storms!" It also said: "Today's Long Yun is winking at the democratic front, wagging his tail and begging for pity. However, the Long Mansion staged a scene of imprisoning reporters while inviting them, which is a great disappointment. What do democratic people think of this? I think if Long Yun doesn't talk about democracy, then so be it. If he talks about democracy, he should learn the real democratic style. Imprisoning reporters is an insult to all Hong Kong journalists. Even democratic newspaper reporters will not sympathize. You must know that this is Hong Kong under the rule of law, not the Yunnan of the past."

The newspaper finally ridiculed Long Yun: "Speaking of which, Lao Long's history also has many things worth writing about in detail. Due to space limitations, a brief introduction is as follows.

(1) Among the warlords who occupied and dominated a region in China, he had the longest life, lasting until the victory of the Anti-Japanese War before being invited to Nanjing by the central government.

(2) Wang Jingwei, the number one traitor in China, was released by him.

(3) In the past, Hong Kong's drug addicts believed that the best "Yunnan opium" was produced during Lao Long's reign.

(4) And there's so much more to say…"

### Hong Kong Journalist to Sue Long Yun for Assault

[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 13th] Chen Zhihua, a field reporter for the conservative Overseas Chinese Daily here, will sue Long Yun for assault and illegal detention. Chen declared today that he went to attend a press conference convened by Long Yun on Monday, but was blocked by Long Yun's guards. He then walked into the garden of the house and was attacked and detained in a dark room until other reporters reported to the police, who rescued him.

Marvels of Ancient and Modern Times

During the winter, some sandpipers stay on the island of South Na, a small and agile bird. With a strong migratory ability, it inevitably has to travel five thousand five hundred kilometers on the way to Siberia in the spring. Scientists have not yet been able to figure out why they leave the warm and beautiful South Sea Island and brave the difficulties and risks to go to the lonely, cold, and snowy land to lay their eggs.

To this day, many tribes in Africa believe that a person has two souls: one belonging to the person himself, and the other attached to other animals. Whether a person or an animal becomes ill or dies, it is inevitably related to the other soul. In Nigeria, a hunter shot a female hippopotamus near a local village. Coincidentally, a native woman suddenly died several hours later. The hunter was fined 25 yuan by the local judge as compensation.

The sandboats seen in Fuzhou have neither sails nor rudders, only a long oar longer than the boat's body, like a broom, placed horizontally at the stern. It is propelled forward by a person rowing it.

### Yangtze River Fortress: Jiangyin

— Our Correspondent, Li Tianxing

[Our Bureau, Wujin, 13th dispatch] This reporter, taking advantage of the "Military and Political Inspection Group" jointly formed by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the First Pacification Headquarters going to Cheng to work, accompanied the group to visit Jiangyin, a fortress on the Yangtze River. I stayed for two days, looked up at the Huangshan Fort, interviewed about the river defense works, toured the city, listened carefully to the people's concerns. The information I gathered all points to a picture of the turbulent Jiangnan of today.

The Military and Political Inspection Group was established in response to the review of the current military and political gains and losses and reforms at the Pacification Conference, which led to the proposal of a supervision plan. It was jointly decided by the Provincial Administrative Office and the Pacification District. The main tasks are: (1) rectifying military discipline, (2) eliminating corruption, and (3) relieving the suffering of the people. The organization is roughly divided into three groups: the Political Affairs Group, the Discipline Inspection Group, and the Appeasement Group. Each group is led by a group leader, and they cooperate in division of labor. All matters related to Baojia household registration, grain administration, conscription, justice, military discipline, and training are all targets for inquiry and supervision, and the authority is quite large. If it is found that officials are corrupt or soldiers violate military discipline and disturb or harm the people, they can be dealt with on the spot. Dismissal, execution, investigation... all are within their power. This was specially granted by Chairman Ding, who is also the commander, at a time when people's hearts are turbulent and the world is in turmoil, to demand a change in the atmosphere and clarify the chaos. This bold and decisive move is indeed necessary.

The group plans to conduct extensive inspections in more than 20 counties in the Jiangnan area under its jurisdiction. The first stop is Jiangyin, and then Suzhou, Kunshan, Taicang, Changshu, and other places will be visited in turn. From the perspective of the Provincial Administration, the entire local politics can be supervised; from the perspective of the Pacification District Administration, everything about the local garrison troops can be inspected. This is a dual-track military and political system that is unified. If it is properly used, correctly implemented, and works persistently and conscientiously, it should have special effects in remedying current malpractices. But all of this remains to be seen.

Land of Loyalty and Righteousness, Region of Integrity

Jiangyin has a glorious page in history. During the transition between the Ming and Qing dynasties, Registrar Yan Yingyuan trained local landlords and the people, led the militia to defend the isolated city, and resisted the Qing troops for more than eighty days. In the end, the entire city sacrificed itself, and no one surrendered. Their spirit and blood vividly wrote the four characters "Land of Loyalty and Righteousness," shining through the ages and remaining immortal for eternity. Perhaps it is because Huangshan's terrain is so strong, and the Yangtze River's currents are so powerful, that the land's spirit and beauty have influenced the people's emotions and character. The people of Jiangyin are born with a spirit of strength. "Dao ze la!" "Dao mo shi," (what does it mean?) every word is spoken decisively and powerfully. During the period of occupation, very few people from Jiangyin surrendered to the enemy, so recently they have been praised as a "Region of Integrity." The county covers an area of hundreds of li, with a population of 750,000, 42 townships. The urban area has a population of only over 30,000. The four rural areas have many large towns. Qingyang, Houteng, Yangshe and other towns are all commercially prosperous and densely populated. The territory borders the Yangtze River to the north, connects with Kaijiang to the southwest, and borders Changshu and Wuxi to the southeast. Except for the mountains and hills along the river, the entire territory is a fertile central area of Jiangnan. It can be considered a veritable "land of fish and rice." Education is quite developed in the county, with nearly 20 middle schools and more than 400 primary schools, and two newspapers, the cultural level is quite high. The terrain of the county, if viewed from the perspective of a gentleman, is a top hat. If viewed from the perspective of a housewife, it is a kitchen knife, and from the perspective of a musician, it is clearly a full note on the Yangtze River score.

Jiangyin, with its superior geographical conditions and glorious history, cannot avoid the suffering of this century today. And it must shoulder this heavy burden of suffering even more difficultly, and run through this era without any ease.

Huangshan Fortress, Junshan Battery

Huangshan Fortress and Junshan Battery, plus the Changshan position, armed Jiangyin. Huangshan is located northeast of the county seat. The mountain ridge is winding and folded into three or four peaks. The peak directly points to the Yangtze River and extends into the heart of the river, like an iron gate. The river must turn a corner here, and also moves north with the mountain, bypassing the peak before flowing east again. Therefore, standing on Huangshan and looking at the ships coming and going east and west on the Yangtze River, they all face forward in reverence, as clear as in the palm of your hand. Junshan is located west of Huangshan, directly north of the county seat. The isolated peak rises abruptly, closely controlling the Yangtze River and pointing far to the north bank. The ports of Baweijiuwei, Shiweishiyiyi... are all clearly visible. It is naturally a lookout for the county seat, and can also be said to be a large bunker. East of Huangshan, along the south bank of the Yangtze River, is another stretch of undulating hills, which is the Changshan position. Now all three mountains have been completely equipped with various types of cannons with different calibers, and ranges. The longest range reaches 30 li, and the firepower is fierce. It is said that at the beginning of the lunar year, the Communist army wanted to try to cross the river, and the fortress also tried to fire its cannons. As a result, the shells fell into the heart of the river, and the white waves flew together with the ferries. The fortress side achieved satisfactory success. It is generally estimated that the power of the cannons greatly helps the defenders ensure the bridgehead position of the Bawei Port across the river. The fortress troops have also put a lot of effort into this place, actively deploying for several months. The trenches, artillery emplacements, and communication trenches have been constructed quite successfully. At each position, sentries shoulder their guns, guarding far and near. The surface of the Yangtze River is so quiet, with no sails in sight, only a few military ships lined up in the river. Not even a white gull flies over. The scenery of the river country is far from ordinary. "Tense," "solemn," "strong," "heavy"... these are all adjectives for the atmosphere in Jiangyin today. Outside the fortress, along the river, from Taohuagang, which borders Wujin in the west, to Jinjigang in Changshu in the east, the river defense works stretch for 620 li along the winding river. There are also trenches, bunkers... Along the river road, road closures, bridges, culverts... have all been completed in order. "Everything for the front line," "Military affairs first," the 750,000 people of Jiangyin, hoarsely, shouldered this heavy burden. County Magistrate Wei Xifang also shouted a "terrible" appeal to the large army gathering under his jurisdiction.

Decline in Industry and Commerce, Financial Difficulties

The smell of military affairs and the war clouds of the fortress have enveloped this ancient city for years and months. Industry and commerce are inherently underdeveloped. Since the war in northern Jiangsu has approached the banks of the Yangtze River, and the Yangtze River has been blockaded, cutting off north-south transportation, industry and commerce have become even more suffocated. There are only two factories. Liyong Yarn Factory outside the North Gate has 170,000 spindles. The machines are old and the performance is weak, producing about 30 pieces of 20-count yarn per day. Another Huakang Yarn Factory is smaller than Liyong, with 8,000 spindles, producing nearly 20 pieces of 20-count yarn per day. The war has cut off the source of raw cotton, and yarn sales are sluggish. Now most of them are spinning cotton on behalf of the US Aid Economic Cooperation Administration to maintain operations. The situation is quite difficult. In the past, folk weaving was also a major side business in Jiangyin, but now it has been affected by the war and has declined! In the past, the most important commercial activity was the large-scale southward transport of pigs from northern Jiangsu, with pig markets standing in rows, making it one of the largest markets. The second is the fish market. Every fish season, the streets are full of fresh fish with new tails. The most famous knife fish, shad, and pufferfish... are transported from Jiangyin in tens of thousands of shi. The third is the north-south transport of cotton cloth, rice, and wheat. In the past, the Huangtian port was full of sails, and boats were as dense as weaving, but now everything has stopped due to the blockade of the Yangtze River! The entire Jiangyin market is deserted and desolate. All that can be seen are batches of silver bulls standing on the streets, jingling and shouting, "Big heads, small heads, want them? Got them?..." The scene is quite miserable!

The county's finances feel even more distressed. In the 37th year, only 34% of the land tax was collected. The major items of the five taxes, such as the slaughter tax and the fish tax... have all been frozen due to the blockade! Legal persons—factories, companies, and commercial firms—are all shaken and on the verge of collapse, unable to take care of themselves. Natural persons—rich and powerful families—have all run far away! They are not in Jiangyin. Some state-owned banks, such as the provincial and county banks, cannot even come up with 500,000 yuan in cash at one time. The state of poverty is imaginable. However, the supplementary food supply for the troops and the supply of materials for the river defense works require an expenditure of 50,000 shi of rice per month. Everything is for responding to emergencies, everything is for the Yangtze River. This expense cannot be apportioned, but it must be apportioned, and it cannot be borne, but it must be borne. In any case, we must get through this era.

The People's Voices, a Sea of Suffering

After the inspection group arrived in Jiangyin, it convened a symposium in the county government, gathering the heads of various districts and townships, as well as the heads of various institutions, companies, and groups, to listen to the people's concerns. Deputy Group Leader Wang Shiying first delivered a speech, explaining the three major tasks of the inspection group. Then came the frank voices of the people. Speaker Chen Zhisheng stood up and said:

"The people of Jiangyin have reached a point where they cannot continue to bear the burden of defense and supply. It is really unbearable. However, everything is for the country, for the nation, for freedom. We cannot shrug off our responsibilities. We only ask that in this unavoidable situation, the government be considerate of the people and do its best to reduce all unnecessary suffering. For example, corruption, false accusations, framing, beatings... all unnecessary complications should be eliminated..." Then several representatives spoke out righteously:

"Conscription is all about raising family allowance for conscription. The new recruits are conscripted, but soon they all slip back. What's the use of this?...

Collecting grain, Jiangyin has many accumulated problems. There was a major corruption case in the 35th year's grain administration, which has not been prosecuted to this day. In recent years, the grain administration has deteriorated day by day, enriching corrupt officials.

Since the victory, river defense works have been built every year. It is strange that they are repaired and demolished, and demolished and rebuilt. I don't know how much manpower and financial resources have been wasted. In the end, it is the common people who suffer. When the country does things, it always lacks an overall plan and does not consider economic efficiency at all.

Public school teachers are really too poor. A section chief in the county government, with a family of six, has not had food for many days, only eating porridge. This serious reality, how can public school teachers survive?..."

Problem after problem, difficulty upon difficulty, living struggling on the front line, life lashed by the front line, everything is being tested, everything is being refined. In the wind and rain, millions of people in Jiangnan are all in the same situation. From Jiangyin, we can get a glimpse of the overall situation in Jiangnan today.

### Miniature News

Wuxi [Our Bureau] Since the Wuxi Xiezhong Self-Defense Headquarters announced that public school teachers and news reporters could be exempted from guard duty, the town offices do not include employees of the central bureau, post office, telecommunications bureau, and power plant within the scope of public school personnel, and insist on guard duty. Deputy Commander Liao stated that before instructions are received from the Provincial Security Command, employees of each bureau must participate in guard duty. However, this matter has greatly affected transportation work, and the heads of various agencies, considering their heavy responsibilities, have jointly consulted with the county government.

### Reader Consultation, Legal Interpretation, Rural Land Lease Issues [Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi]

Hong Wenwen asks: Mr. Jia in my village has several acres of land, which are leased to Mr. Yi as a kiln. It is stipulated that the annual rent will be calculated in rice, and the rice will be sent when it is available after the harvest. If the lease is not for long, the rent will never be increased or redeemed. Conversely, Mr. Yi can sell the goods on the land. It is also stipulated that no soil may be dug on the land. Now, there are several questions, please answer them.

(1) Does Mr. Jia's son have the right to take it for his own use? (2) Can Mr. Yi's rent arrears for three months be used as a reason for redemption? (3) If soil has been dug on the land, can we proceed according to the agreement? (4) In addition, what are the methods and steps for redemption?

[Answer] The situation may not be as simple as described in the letter. Now, I will answer according to the questions: (1) Mr. Jia owns the land and exercises the right of ownership and rents it out. If Mr. Jia exists, then his son has no right to collect rent, unless Mr. Jia's son is authorized by Mr. Jia as an agent. (2) Strictly speaking, violating the lease can lead to termination, such as rent arrears, and (3) digging soil. The wording of the lease should be studied in detail before making claims. (4) To redeem the leased land, there must be a reason for redemption. It is not possible to do so rashly. The law does not allow arbitrary claims.

### The Equalization Fund Temporarily Stipulates the Exchange Rate Between Gold and Silver Dollars: 48 "Yuan Datou" Silver Dollars Exchange for One Taels of Gold

[Our Bureau] Today is the middle of the month, and it is time for various sectors to pay salaries. The market's need for cash is expected to become more urgent. In order to solve the difficulty of cash shortage, the Central Bank, in light of the practical situation, temporarily stipulated in the Gold and Silver Equalization Committee that one tael of gold (with a purity of 99% or higher) could be exchanged for 48 silver dollars with Yuan Shikai's image, to supplement the shortage of cash for various sectors when paying salaries.

Yesterday, a certain official of the bank stated that the total amount of cash required for salary payments in various sectors this month is estimated to be approximately 180 billion yuan. After the bank has tried to raise funds, the maximum amount that can be issued in cash is 90 billion yuan. For the remaining half, various sectors can decide on the salary payment method on their own. If silver dollars are needed, they can try to purchase Yuan Datou silver dollars from the National Bank through money shops and dealers with gold. The bank will provide them without limit.

The ratio of gold to Yuan Datou yesterday was one tael to 48 yuan. The ratio in the future will be adjusted dynamically depending on the market price. The above method is a temporary measure decided due to the cash shortage during salary payments this month, and it is not unchangeable.

### Outflow of Taiwan Currency Loosens Silver, Chinese Stocks Rise After Breaking Through

[Our Bureau] Under the special emergency measures of the financial authorities yesterday, the Hua stock market was filled with tight silver and heavy pressure, and the general trend was unanimously bearish. Giant shorts have been repeatedly frustrated for a long time, and the pressure is deepening, but the bulls still dare to come out and resist, and the market rose after breaking through.

Yongsheng opened at 53 yuan in the morning. Large investors wanted to let go first and then pull, and the market rose to 57.5 yuan. Shorts frequently suppressed it to 52 yuan. It hovered at low levels all the way, and the trend was very soft. Near noon, it was heard that a large amount of yarn and cloth remittances from the Bank of Taiwan were pouring out. Emergency working loans will be approved and released one after another from today. The supply situation is good. Yarn merchants tried to lift it, and Zheng Chongren took advantage of the situation to pull it up. The market's buying interest suddenly surged, and the market rose all the way to 58 yuan at closing.

Small and medium-sized stocks all opened weakly in the morning, and closed higher in the afternoon. Xinyi opened at 13 yuan, fell to a low of 12.5 yuan, and closed at 13.7 yuan in the afternoon.

Miscellaneous stocks, except for Taiwan Sugar, Commerce Tongyi, Shangni Zhonghuo, etc., which rose to the limit and closed, the rest saw a slight squeeze.

The tight silver situation eased slightly in the afternoon. The off-market gold rose, and because the index is about to be released today, the situation of the goods is firm and the stocks are rising, which is bound to be positive. Therefore, the bulls' psychology is extremely strong, and various stocks have risen to the limit.

Yongsheng initially traded at 60.05 yuan and 61.2 yuan, and rose all the way to 64 yuan, several times rising to the limit. Application for closing the transaction initially traded at 60 yuan, and after a slight decline, it quickly rose to 63.5 yuan at closing, with a turnover of 340 million plus 140,000 shares.

In the afternoon, due to the emergency working loan from the central bank, a large amount of funds flowed out, and people's minds turned for the better. There was even talk of issuing 50,000 and 100,000 banknotes. The appetite of all parties was unblocked, and the buying interest was booming. It opened at 4.2 million and stepped out of the 5 million mark, reaching as high as 5 million and 5.1 million at closing.

### No Transaction of Eagle Dragon Silver Dollar

[Our Bureau] Yesterday, the ratio of silver dollars to gold fluctuated rapidly. At the Securities Exchange Building, the matched number, the opening price was one tael of gold for 41 silver coins and sells one tael of gold for 43 silver coins, then rises to 42, 44, 43, 45, and near noon rises to 44, 46, 45, 48. In the afternoon, because the Central Bank announced that one tael of gold can be exchanged for 48 silver coins, it once fell to 44, 46, 44, 47. Finally, it was still 45, 48. The small head was made at 57, 62, then rose to 58, 63. In the afternoon, it was still 57, 62. Due to lack of inquiries, the transaction of Eagle Dragon Silver Dollar was temporarily suspended. There was also no transaction of exchanging big head for small head, and big head for Dragon Eagle Silver Dollar.

[Our Bureau] Yesterday's silver dollar arbitrage turned scarce. Approximately 200,000 sets of cash were transferred out in the southern and western directions. The market trend was tired and then lively. In the morning, the big head shouted 83,000 and 87,000, and there was some absorption at low prices at noon, once rising to 88,000 and 93,000. Finally, due to the banks' best efforts to spit out, and the chips were abundant, it once fell to 83,000 and 88,000 in the afternoon. Finally, due to the sharp rise in gold prices, it shouted up to 95,000 and 100,000, the small head shouted 75,000 and 80,000, and the Dragon Eagle Silver Dollar rose to 55,000 and 60,000.

[Our Bureau] Recently, the price of miscellaneous silver coins has deviated farther and farther from the price of Big Head. This is a really abnormal trend because the silver quality of Eagle Dragon Silver Dollar such as miscellaneous silver coins are higher than that of Big Head. It is reported that after the Central Bank has sorted the miscellaneous silver coins and returned them to the furnace, they can be restored into ship coins. It is said that one hundred miscellaneous silver coins can be remelted into one hundred and five ship coins. Therefore, miscellaneous silver coins are bound to have a good side in the short term.

### Gold Bonds and Foreign Stocks Rise Sharply

Gold bonds Yesterday, the silver situation was tight, the peoples minds was tired and soft. In the morning, the prices were opened at 1.8 million, dropped to 1.7 million, the price have been hovering for a long time, and at last 1.7 million at midday, in the afternoon the market squeeze and small, each parties took the opportunity to buy the market has rebounded, and the early stage opened at 1.85 million and peaked at 2 million, and the trading volume was 48 taels.

Yazhou trading at 120,000 yuan, 130,000 yuan, Yewen shouts to buy in at 36,000 yuan, Jardine, Matheson shout can buy in at 45,000 yuan, there are no sells.

### Stagnation in Cotton Yarn Trading, Relaxation in Fabric Prices

The Japanese cotton yarn market has temporarily suspended its market due to the authorities' sudden rejection of various firms' use of gold and silver as collateral, resulting in the failure of capital turnover. Many next-day bills were dishonored, and disputes over interest among businesses frequently occurred.

Yesterday, the fabric market experienced a sudden tightening of credit, leading to a general shortage of orders within the industry. Many small traders sought to liquidate their debts for cash. Early in the morning, a large number of businesses were engaging in distressed sales, with continuous price cuts at the counters. Market prices uniformly softened, and few transactions took place in the market.

Dragon Head Fine Cloth opened at 465,000 yuan and briefly saw a high of 470,000 yuan. However, by noon, it was unable to withstand the pressure and rapidly declined to 402,000 yuan. By the close, it had rebounded slightly due to some short covering, ending at 453,000 yuan, a drop of 35,000 yuan. Five Blessings Fine Cloth also followed the decline, closing at 415,000 yuan.

The Four Gentlemen Serge also fell by 30,000 yuan, closing at 443,000 yuan at noon. Due to firms refusing to accept promissory notes and requiring payment by promissory note for delivery, problems arose in settling transactions. The market then temporarily announced a one-day closure. Regarding the off-market asking prices, it was heard that the Four Gentlemen Serge was being quoted at 520,000 yuan, but there were no transactions.

### Market Plagued by Dishonored Checks

Temporary Suspension of Trading in Yarn, Silk, Flour, and Other Industries

Since the National Bank announced on the 13th that it would no longer accommodate firms lacking funds or gold, and the Gold Control Bureau reiterated that bills could not be used for same-day credit, while also sending personnel to investigate firms' issuance of promissory notes, firms have become more cautious with their clients. Regarding overdraft clients who had previously been allowed to use bills as collateral, many were processing dishonored checks yesterday to prevent being implicated by the authorities' stricter regulations. As a result, the gold, cotton yarn, rayon, silk, and flour markets experienced frequent disputes over next-day dishonored checks. These issues had not yet been resolved, preventing market activity and resulting in very few transactions, with trading almost coming to a standstill. Cash liquidity has become even more desirable, with interest rates rising from 5% to 10%, and large sums are difficult to obtain even at that rate.

Tight Credit, High Underground Interest Rates, Rice Prices Down Across the Board, Flour Market Closed Yesterday, Vegetable Oil Flat and Weak

Rice prices have fallen due to the severe credit crunch. At the same time, because bills are strictly prohibited as collateral, most transactions are being conducted with same-day bills or cash, and very few next-day transactions are taking place. In the South Market, Bai Geng rice and Bo Dao rice for immediate payment are priced at 420,000 yuan, each down 30,000 yuan. In the North Market, Bai Geng rice is priced at 460,000 yuan and Bo Dao rice at 450,000 yuan, both for cash payment. Total arrivals in the two markets amounted to 3,321 shi.

Vegetable oil trading has effectively come to a standstill due to the prohibition of same-day credit for checks and frequent disputes over dishonored checks among businesses. Furthermore, because importers have no liquidity, sellers are also cautious and unwilling to sell. Soybean oil opened at 2.25 million yuan, then Datong soybean oil was quoted at 2.5 million yuan, and raw rapeseed oil opened at 2.1 million yuan. The market was flat and weak, and soybean cake did not open.

Flour: There was no trading yesterday due to the aftermath of the Central Bank's large-scale selling the day before, which led to a tight credit situation. Additionally, the Silver Money Trust Industry Association received an order from the Gold Control Bureau strictly prohibiting the use of bills for same-day credit, causing businesses to lose liquidity and disputes over dishonored checks to erupt. From the opening to the close of the market, businesses were busy clearing bills, so trading was impossible. After the market closed, Military Ship Flour was quoted at 150,000 yuan, a drop of more than 10% from the previous day.

Trading in miscellaneous grains was sparse. With tight liquidity, the market trend was uniformly downward. Yellow things fell, winter beans traded at 410,000 yuan, corn prices dropped sharply by 20%, Huang Du corn retreated to the 200,000 yuan level, and broad beans and sesame seeds were slightly lower. Red sorghum and raw peanuts did not open.

### Ninth Anniversary Celebration of Zhongnan Rubber Factory

[Reported by this newspaper] The Zhongnan Rubber Factory, founded by overseas Chinese Zhuang Yisheng and others, celebrated its ninth anniversary yesterday. The factory specially invited members of the press to tour the factory's facilities and observe its operations.

According to Zhuang Yisheng's statement to reporters, the factory was initially established in Kunming in August of the 29th year of the Republic (1940). In the spring of that year, Zhuang followed the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Delegation back to China to express condolences and visited various provinces in the southwestern hinterland. He deeply felt the lack of a rubber industry, which hindered road transportation and greatly affected wartime transport. Therefore, he invited comrades from Guangdong and Fujian among the Malayan overseas Chinese to raise capital and purchase machinery and raw materials. After many twists and turns, they were able to establish a factory in Kunming. Subsequently, they continued to establish factories in Guiyang, Chongqing, Guangyuan, Qujiang, and other places. During the War of Resistance, they successively supplied more than 100,000 tires to the rear, saving the country an estimated foreign exchange of at least US$10 million.

After the victory, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in consideration of the factory's contributions to the War of Resistance, specially approved the priority purchase of the Shanghai factory of the enemy property Xingya Rubber Co., Ltd., and renamed it as the Shanghai Factory. Currently, four units in factories in Shanghai, Chongqing, and other places are continuing to maintain operations. The "22x60" mixing mill in the Shanghai Factory is the largest equipment of its kind in the industry in the city. Currently, the average monthly output of the four factories includes 9,000 sets of various tires, 2,500 retreaded tires, 1.2 million ply-meters of flat belts, 450,000 pairs of cloth shoes, 63,000 pairs of rubber shoes, and 56,000 pounds of various rubber products.

The automobile tire manufacturing machinery ordered by the factory from the United Kingdom has already been fully shipped to Shanghai and can be installed and put into production. After installation, the estimated monthly production volume includes 3,750 sets of truck tires sized 34x7 and 32x6, and 1,250 sets of passenger car tires sized 650-16 and 600-16.

Zhuang stated that overseas Chinese have recently suffered from the squeeze of colonial authorities and locals and can no longer live and work in peace and happiness as they did before the war. Therefore, if the domestic situation is stable and various parties provide encouragement and guidance, overseas Chinese capital will be able to continuously flow to the country's production enterprises.

The Central Bank Uses the Temptation Tactic Again, An Ambush to Annihilate is Imminent

The Central Bank has really been using its brains lately, and it came up with a new trick again yesterday.

It opened its doors, welcoming people to exchange one tael of gold for 48 yuan in silver dollars. It was willing to supply silver dollars without limit at this gold-silver exchange rate.

However, all day yesterday, not a single person made such an exchange.

At first glance, it seems that the Central Bank's strategy has failed. In reality, it was a success.

This strategy is not really a "gold collection movement," but a "silver dollar crashing movement."

In recent years, silver dollar prices have risen to a fever pitch. Especially after examining the gold-silver ratio, it can be seen that silver dollars have risen too excessively.

Yesterday, no one used gold to exchange for silver dollars, which proves that silver dollars have risen too excessively. Therefore, no one is willing to use gold to exchange for silver dollars.

But thinking about it the other way around, the excessive rise in silver dollars means that the price of gold has not risen enough. The price of gold "should" catch up with silver dollars. As a result, the price of gold began to rise sharply again in the afternoon, breaking through the 50 million yuan mark.

Therefore, the Central Bank's move yesterday has a strong suspicion of stimulating a sharp rise in gold prices.

The day before yesterday, the Central Bank refused to accept gold and cash for collateral from firms, which was a measure to suppress gold prices. The price of gold did indeed collapse in the afternoon the day before yesterday.

Yesterday, however, the Central Bank linked the price of gold to silver dollars, indirectly raising the price of gold. The price of gold did indeed rise sharply again yesterday afternoon.

Why is the Central Bank acting so erratically?

It is possible to see it as manipulating the market.

It is also possible to see it as disrupting the market.

But at the core, everyone must be careful! It is playing the strategy of "enticing the enemy to go deep and then annihilating them."

In warfare, luring the enemy deep into one's own position, then giving a drumbeat, with ambushing soldiers rising from all sides, surrounding the enemy, and wiping them out in one fell swoop, this is called the "enticement" tactic.

The Central Bank has recently been using this ruthless method to crack down on speculators. It first provokes a bullish trend, even adding fuel to the fire. When everyone is blinded by greed, it then applies great pressure, frantically sucking up credit. People who are full of gold, cash, and commodities are then squeezed to death under the pressure of unprecedentedly high interest rates.

Now, the Central Bank is probably arranging this tragicomedy again. I can point out the Central Bank's recent ambushes.

(1) Recently, there have been rumors that gold is being shipped from the United States; and that gold seized by Japan is also being shipped back. Whether these are true or false is not the point. This is clearly a planned publicity stunt to strengthen the image of future selling.

(2) Starting the day before yesterday, the refusal to accept gold and cash as collateral, on the one hand, shows that the Central Bank does not care about gold and cash, and also serves to publicize its strong ability to "sell." On the other hand, it cuts off the retreat for firms in the future. If firms frantically hoard gold and cash during the bullish trend, then when credit tightens, the Central Bank will close its doors and refuse to accept it, leading to self-inflicted consequences and a dead end.

Yesterday, the Central Bank suddenly brought up the gold-silver ratio, clearly to evoke the impression of "gold being cheap and silver being expensive." And the sharp rise in gold prices in the afternoon proves that people have already had this impression. In addition, large banknotes will be issued today and tomorrow, and the city's wages and salaries will also be released, so market prices may go crazy, and the Central Bank can "surround and annihilate" again.

Gold and Cash Soar Suddenly Yesterday Afternoon, Speculators May Have Fallen into the Trap

### Anecdotes from the "Marathon"

— Jinjin (Part 1)

Every year on April 19th, the city of Boston commemorates an important day. Everyone calls it Patriots' Day, which commemorates Paul Revere's ride. However, sports enthusiasts know that this is the annual Boston Marathon race. Participants are of all ages, and each person pays a fee of one U.S. dollar. They run from Hopkinton to Boston, a distance that meets the standard marathon length of 26 miles and 385 yards. About 175 people participate.

Have you ever walked 26 miles? Assuming you have to complete this distance in two and a half hours, how would your mind and body feel? In other words, you must complete one mile in six minutes, which means you must walk ten miles per hour. You can't stroll, you have to stand up straight and stride forward quickly. But participants in the Boston Marathon usually complete one mile in less than six minutes. The best record is about five minutes and ten seconds per mile.

Judging by this, it seems that the competitors do not feel tired, but that is not the case. To complete a marathon, you must not only have a strong will, but also superhuman energy. Typical racers often run until they are exhausted. Some even die halfway through due to exhaustion.

In the 1910 Saint Hugh Marathon, two people died. In the 1912 Olympic Marathon, the leading Portuguese athlete, Lazaro, ran unconscious and died in the hospital the next day. In the 1904 Olympics, American San Francisco athlete Bill Garcia suddenly suffered a stomach spasm eight miles from the finish line and almost died. In 1924, three athletes fainted on the ground after running 400 yards, and another athlete lost consciousness and crashed into the cement wall in front of the grandstand, his face covered in blood. In the 1908 race, Docado, Piacol, fainted four times in a row as he approached the finish line. Doctors examined him and found that his heart had shifted from its original position by more than half an hour. After recovering, he still participated in the race.

In the 1928 Boston Marathon, one-mile race champion Joe Lai, thinking he was invincible, decided to participate in the race and compete against marathon veteran Clarence, the Race Horse. Joe Lai usually wore spiked shoes and ran on cinder tracks, but this time he changed into running shoes and competed with people on asphalt roads. After he walked five miles, many blisters formed on the soles of his feet, but he followed the Race Horse relentlessly. The blisters burst, and the shoes embedded into his flesh. Soon, blood filled his shoes, leaving bloody footprints along the way as he ran. Although the Race Horse was far ahead, Joe Lai still finished the entire course. His shoes were already fused with blood and flesh, and he stayed in the hospital for several weeks before he could walk. After suffering this great injury, Joe Lai's passion for marathons did not diminish. Two months after the Boston race, he defeated the Race Horse in a New York race. In the same summer, Joe Lai again defeated the Race Horse in the Olympics, ranking among the top.

This year's Boston Marathon is the 53rd since it began. Many sports fans often prepare for a year in advance so that they can show their skills at the time. They participate in the event year after year, and their enthusiasm has not waned.

The Race Horse mentioned above is a printer from Massachusetts. Kars is the first marathon fanatic. He participates in the race every April 19th and has done so 37 times. He has won the championship seven times, the first time in 1911 and the last time in 1930. In 1947, at the age of 57, he ranked 32nd out of 101 racers.

But compared to the other racers, Peter Fogg is slightly inferior. This man is already 85 years old with a full white beard. In the 1938 race, he ran in front of all the racers, which surprised the audience. In fact, although he completed the entire course, he started two hours earlier than the other racers. Fogg has been participating in the race for nearly 30 years. After he turned 50, the Boston Athletic Association refused to register him because he was too old. He had no choice but to automatically join the race one minute after the other racers started. Even today, he is still more energetic than the average racer. It is common to see racers who fail to complete the entire course.

Most participants disregard the doctor's advice. A doctor told Sidney that participating in a marathon would shorten his life by ten years, but he ignored it and participated a total of sixty times. Before the start of the 1911 Boston race, a doctor said that the Race Horse had a serious heart condition and warned him not to participate again, telling him, "If you feel tired, quit immediately." The Race Horse smiled and replied, "I don't know if you can avoid feeling tired after running a marathon, but I have never felt tired." As a result, he won the race. (To be continued)

### The League Basketball A-2 Tournament Concludes, Donghua Maintains a Perfect Record

[Reported by Guoguang News Agency] Yesterday was the final day of the sectional matches for the fourth League Basketball A-2 Group. There were originally two games, but in the first game, Group A’s Xiqing Blue forfeited to Donghua. Donghua won without effort, creating a perfect record and securing the top spot in that division. In the Group D match between the Shantou team and the Dolphins, the strengths of the two teams were about equal, and the outcome was particularly important for their rankings. The game was extremely tense, and the Dolphins ultimately defeated the Shantou team 38-32.

It was heard that after the start of the game, Shantou team's Chen Qingjiang broke into the basket and scored the first point, only five seconds after the opening whistle. Not wanting to be outdone, Dolphins' Hou Yongkang and Lin Shaohua both scored, and Lü Miaosheng followed with a free throw, giving them a 5-2 lead. Zheng Guofan broke through from the corner, and Chen Qingjiang scored a free throw, tying the score at 5-5. Soon after, Dolphins' Lin Shaohua and Tao Yingshi scored again, making it 9-5, prompting the Shantou team to call a timeout. Luo Shaoqiong committed a foul, and Lin Shaohua scored another point, and Zhou Binhu hit a basket. The Shantou team substituted Chen Mingyi for Zheng Jiatao. Dolphins' Hou Yongkang scored a long shot, making it 12-7. Niu Yinmao substituted for Ouyang Guangzhi and called their first timeout. Guofan, Yingshi, Shaoqiong, and Yinmao traded baskets, and the Dolphins led 16-11, five points ahead. The Shantou team pressed hard, and Shaoqiong and Guofan scored consecutively. Chen Mingyi made a free throw, and the score was tied again at 16-16. Mingyi scored another point, and Qingjiang made a free throw, putting the Shantou team ahead again at 19-16. Shaohua then scored, and the first half ended with the Shantou team leading by half a point at 19-18.

In the second half, the Shantou team substituted Zheng Guitao and Guichang for Zhou Bin and Zheng Guofan. Dolphins' Ouyang Guangzhi made a free throw, tying the score at 19-19. The Shantou team's Guitao scored a basket and a free throw, adding three points. Dolphins' Yongkang scored consecutively, reversing the lead to 22-21. The Shantou team called a timeout. Qingjiang made a long shot, putting them ahead again. But soon after, Dolphins' Ouyang Guangzhi and Lü Miaosheng scored one after the other, making it 26-23, prompting the Shantou team to call their third timeout. Afterwards, the Dolphins maintained their lead all the way, with Lü Miaosheng and Tao Yingshi particularly active. By the time the score reached 34-27, there was little time left, and the Shantou team had lost all hope. Despite their best efforts, Qingjiang and Guofan scored three baskets, but Dolphins' Lü Miaosheng also scored three points. As a result, the Shantou team ultimately lost to the Dolphins 32-38. The game results are as follows: (The Basketball Committee will announce the full rankings for the A-2 Group in the coming days)

### The Reason Why Long-Winning Nan Hua South Lost to Chinese Association: A Freezing Cold Football Match in Hong Kong

[Hong Kong News Report] Before the match between Nan Hua South and Chinese Association, Chinese Association felt that their strength was lacking due to the fact that their rising star, Miu Cheung-Wing had gone with the Catholic Student Army to conquer the Philippines. Before the match, who would have dared to think that they had the possibility of overwhelming Nan Hua South? Who knew that their strategist was knowledgeable and found Lau Chi-Ping to replace Miu, even though he also came from the youth training program. Surprisingly, Lau Chi-Ping was bold and meticulous, performing in a well-organized and effective manner. Combined with the other players who also fought actively and all performed above standard, and with the absence of Fung King-Cheung and Lai Siu-Wing, and with Chu Wing-Keung and Tse Kam-Ho not performing up to standard due to insufficient practice, Nan Hua South ultimately failed to maintain their winning streak. The Chinese Association tasted the sweetness of defeating the long-winning team in this season, and with a score of 2-0, the long-winning team suffered the bitterness of being shut out. This upset was truly cold and freezing.

Nan Hua South’s strategist originally intended to use Tin Hip-Bo as left winger, Ho Ying-Fan as left midfielder, Cheung Kam-Hoi as center forward, Chu Wing-Keung as right midfielder, and Fei Chun-Wah as right winger. However, this proposal was not agreed upon by other staff members. As a result, at the start of the match, the two sides had the following formations:

(Nan Hua South)

Tse Kam-Ho Yu Yiu-Tak Hau Yung-Sang

Lau Chung-Ho Tse Kam-Hung Cheung Shu-Ling

Ho Ying-Fan Chu Wing-Keung Cheung Kam-Hoi Tin Hip-Bo Fei Chun-Wah

(Chinese Association)

Lui Shu-Ping Yu Kai-Yan Li Bing-Nam

Leung Bing-Wing Lau Chi-Ping Chan Kam-Pui

Chan Hing-Chuen Ho Yau-Gei Lo Wah-Sing Kwok Cheuk-Cheung Chin Chi-Fen

The Chinese Association players displayed exceptional spirit on this day. From the start of the match, it was clear that their momentum was strong. Kwok Cheuk-Cheung and Chin Chi-Fen even switched positions. Because Kam-Ho was not accustomed to playing left back, this further enhanced their dominance. Wah-Sing had enough sprinting power and often posed a great threat to Nan Hua South. Although Nan Hua South fought actively, they were mostly on the defensive. When they did gain possession, they could not overcome Bing-Nam and Shu-Ping, who were playing exceptionally well. Later, although Nan Hua South shot on goal several times, they could not get past Yu Kai-Yan. Throughout the game, Kai-Yan only fumbled the ball once. However, that one instance was extremely dangerous, as the ball was bouncing towards the goal. Fortunately, Shu-Ping covered the goal well, hooking the ball out at the last moment with one kick. If Chinese Association had conceded that goal first, the outcome of the match might have been completely different. Lui Shu-Ping’s contribution was significant. In another instance, during a goalmouth scramble, Ho Ying-Fan made a superb header towards the goal. The shot was very powerful, but Yu Kai-Yan jumped high and caught the ball, greatly compensating for his earlier fumble. The first half ended in a 0-0 draw, with no winner.

In the second half, Nan Hua South kept Tse Kam-Ho at left winger, Cheung Shu-Ling returned to his old position at left back, and Ho Ying-Fan moved back to right center back. However, Nan Hua South’s situation did not improve as a result of this change. About ten minutes into the second half, the Chinese Association center back made a long pass forward, and the Chinese Association forwards all advanced. A scramble ensued in front of the Nan Hua South goal. Nan Hua South cleared the ball, but it flew to where Kwok Cheuk-Cheung was rushing in, and he seized the opportunity to sweep the ball into the goal, giving the Chinese Association the lead.

After conceding the goal, Nan Hua South rallied and launched a rapid attack for two minutes. Chu Wing-Keung suddenly unleashed a powerful shot from 15 yards out. The ball was about to go in under the crossbar, but Kai-Yan jumped up and pushed it over, resulting in only a corner kick. This was another brilliant play by both the shooter and the goalkeeper. At 6:00 PM, twenty minutes into the second half, Lo Wah-Sing suddenly found himself with a one-on-one opportunity and unleashed a powerful shot to the left. Yu Yiu-Tak made a diving save, preventing a greater disaster but still conceding a corner kick. During another goalmouth scramble, the ball was cleared, but it flew to Chan Kam-Pui, who was rushing in to support. He then swept the ball into the Nan Hua South goal. Yiu-Tak was rushing out to try to make a save but did not anticipate Kam-Pui’s brilliant move. As a result, although Nan Hua South launched a full-scale counterattack, it was to no avail.

### Group A Table Tennis League: Postal Service Decisively Defeats Bank of China; Six Group B Matches to Continue Tonight

In the fourth Shanghai Table Tennis League, the Group A match between the Bank of China team and the formidable Postal Service team took place at the Postal Service's venue last night at 7:00 PM. Fans flocked to the venue, with over three hundred spectators. Due to the small venue, the atmosphere was enthusiastic. The Postal Service's use of young player Wang Chuanyao was particularly impressive. Although lacking in experience, given time, he could become a great player. The Bank of China's lineup arrangement was flawed, with their main player, Zhu Yongkang, avoiding the strong players and facing the Postal Service's main player, Liu Zaoshi. The two engaged in a fierce battle, evenly matched. Liu attacked, and Zhu defended, making it difficult to determine the victor. Although Zhu lost the first game, he led throughout the second, appearing likely to level the score. Unexpectedly, Liu Zaoshi remained exceptionally composed, executing powerful shots to both corners, all hitting their mark. From being behind, he caught up, creating a score of 22-20, ultimately reversing the defeat with two points. Bank of China's Zhu Guozhen unfortunately succumbed to the young Wang Chuanyao in the opening match. In the second match, veteran Zhu also failed, leading to two consecutive losses, severely impacting morale. In the third match, Xie Guocai of Bank of China was disheartened and lost the victory. In the fourth match, the Postal Service's Miao Fulin's skills were not yet refined, and Bank of China's Wang Shaozeng seemed to regain a city with his smashes. In the final match, Bank of China's Jiang Xiaoshi lacked fighting spirit and lost in straight sets to the Postal Service's chubby player, Zhuang Kunrong. As a result, the Postal Service decisively defeated the Bank of China by a score of four to one. The scores of both sides are recorded below:

(Postal Service) Score (Bank of China)

Tonight (the 15th), starting at 7:00 PM, six more matches will continue, all part of the Group B schedule. Lingyun, the runner-up of last year's Group C, and Lianhe, the runner-up of the Insurance Cup, will separately face the Shanbao and Tiemao teams. The former is expected to easily defeat Shanbao, while the latter is likely to capture Tiemao. Additionally, the Dagongbao team, the only new force from the press, will compete against Zhongji. Dagongbao has friendly matches with outsiders and is expected to make its debut in the league tonight. The opponent is also a newcomer, so a fierce battle is expected. The schedule for tonight's matches is recorded below:

Postal Service 18 - Fansheng (Group B2) 7:00 PM Postal Service

Dagongbao - Zhongji (Group B1) 8:30 PM Postal Service

### Allow Genius to Develop on the Right Path

— Xing Lang

The Children's Day "grand event"—the children's music competition held by the Music Education Association—has attracted widespread attention. In this publication, there have been calls for talented children to start receiving music education in a timely manner. However, currently, children who have the opportunity to receive music training often have a mistaken tendency—learning music seems only to be for showing off the family or showing off themselves. Adults should be responsible for this error.

Undeniably, in China at this time and place, children who can have the opportunity to learn music come from relatively wealthy families. The parents of these families usually have not thought about the artistic future of the entire nation. They have no artistic cultivation or understanding themselves and are only satisfied with their children having the playing skills of musical instruments. As a result, what the children gain from music is not the "aesthetic sense" given by art but the vanity-driven "pleasure" caused by the praise of relatives, friends, and even society. In the winners' concert of this music competition, the parent of a "winning child" was sitting in front of me. When her own child was on stage, it was the only time she was relatively quiet; but when other children were playing, she chatted with relatives and friends on both sides without restraint, simply forgetting that she was "listening" to a concert! Under the influence of such parents, even if the child does have talent and is good enough to be hailed as a "prodigy," what benefit can it bring to China's musical art? And social opinion unconditionally fuels this mentality, readily adding the title of "little musician." The original intention may be encouragement, but whether the result will be as expected, I think there is indeed room for discussion.

This phenomenon can only be corrected in two ways:—The teachers who teach music students directly influence children, and only they can inspire children learning music to seriously embark on the path of art, not allowing children to be hindered by the stumbling block of vanity and to degenerate into playing with skills. If they only teach children how to translate the notes on the staff into music on the keyboard or strings, then music is just meaningless air vibration. At the same time, social opinion, while "cheering" for talented children, should also awaken adults' attention: Art is the yardstick of a nation's cultural level, and music is not an ornament or plaything. Leading genius down the wrong path and burying genius are equally unforgivable sins.

Genius is the treasure of the country. If we hope that genius becomes "musicians" who speak for national emotions, not technicians in ivory towers, people must call out: Let genius develop on the right path!

The Largest Dictionary

The world's largest dictionary is the visitor list for the 1893 Columbia Exposition in South Dakota. This book weighs 175 pounds, and when the book is opened, its size is so large that it can accommodate a child crawling on it.

The Smallest Dictionary

The world's smallest dictionary is the English dictionary published in Glasgow, central Scotland, in 1890. It is one inch and one-eighth long, six-tenths of an inch wide, and two-tenths of an inch thick. It was compiled by Dr. Johnson and published by David Bryce and Sons. This small dictionary must be read with a magnifying glass.

### On "Snobbery"

— Si Yi

When I was young, reading the Records of the Grand Historian, I always felt that Sima Qian's description of the "snobbish" faces of Su Qin's father, brothers, wife, and sisters-in-law, with their attitudes changing from arrogance to servility, was not too excessive. It was not until after middle age that I realized that my past feeling was really lacking in common sense.

In fact, snobbery is not a Chinese "national treasure." Since ancient times, regardless of China or foreign countries, the formation of snobbish trends in society has been quite unified, like "crows all over the world are black." However, if we compare them using the logic of "foreign moons are better than Chinese moons," then, in terms of China and the West, it seems that foreigners' effect of snobbery is still somewhat lacking.

For example, if Madame Curie, a world-famous scientist, came to China with her plain clothes, especially Shanghai, I believe that there would definitely be more people who look down on her than people who "regard her as a scientist." The reason is the formation of snobbish trends: we purely take economic status as the standard. Apart from us, although people still are snobbish, in addition to "economic status," they also divide space into "high talent" and "low ability," "diligence" and "laziness," "contribution" and "parasitism," etc.; and for us, the first is "money," the second is "money," and the third is still "money." Then, what are we talking about inherent human morality, education, personality, and others?

Due to the deep-rooted snobbish trends for thousands of years, corruption has never been eradicated in every generation and every dynasty. The reason for coming and going is that society is always like this, "laughing at poverty but not prostitution," so it always forces people to rack their brains and use unscrupulous means.

### A Casual Talk on Appetizers

— Xian Weisheng

I have always been fond of wine. In the past, when wine prices were cheap, I had wine with every meal, but for the sake of frugality, I always had it brought home to drink. This was originally a way to get a little "side dish" money. However, since wine prices have soared, I have been feeling a headache. If I drink, my economic power is not enough; if I don't drink, my throat is itchy, which is really a dilemma. Fortunately, what is enjoyable is the "wine," not the "side dish," so in addition to discounting the "amount," I will also come up with a plan on the "side dish."

Speaking of appetizers, "salty" is originally the best, but if it is "salty" but not "fresh," it is also inferior. It is difficult to find something that meets the three conditions of "salty," "fresh," and "economical." Recently, I searched my brains and actually found a civilian-friendly, inexpensive dish, which is snails. The price is only one hundred yuan per bowl. After removing the tail shells and adding seasoning, it is good to stew it on the rice cooker or cook it in the pot, so there is a saying, "Eight kinds of sea cucumbers are not as good as stewed snails." The deliciousness of its taste can be imagined.

However, snails are best eaten hot, sprinkled with some fermented sauce and added some pepper, then it is really infinitely delicious, and you won't let go even if you are slapped in the face. Combined with the five conditions of hot, fragrant, salty, spicy, and fresh, a bowl of snails can at least be paired with half a catty or a catty of wine, which is simply beneficial and inexpensive.

Of course, this is a civilian dish for us general small clerks. As for wealthy families, there is naturally no need to praise this article.

### Put Down Your Own "Ego"

— Old Child

There are many troubles in the world, and disputes in the world. Although the reasons are extremely complicated, the most fundamental reason is actually only one, which is the harm of the word "ego." We will not mention anything else, just take the structure of the word "ego" as an example, which is already contradictory enough. You see, this word "ego" has "harmony" on one side and "war" on the other, which is basically able to be at war and at harmony, and yet not at war and not at harmony. Therefore, we, on the one hand, may appear to be peaceful; on the other hand, we may also fight among ourselves. Do you want me to be at harmony? I insist on being at war; do you want me to be at war? I want to be at harmony instead. Therefore, harmony and war, war and harmony, will never be clearly understood for generations. However, regardless of whether it is harmony or war, or even neither war nor harmony, fundamentally, it should be entirely up to "me" to make the best decision, which is undoubtedly the case. Performing the tragedy of war? Of course, it is due to my own sins; realizing peace and happiness? Of course, I also need to pursue it myself, which cannot be surpassed by others. However, what exactly am I?

The ancients said: "Skin, face, blood, flesh, bones, and tendons, many fools cannot recognize clearly. Only after death do they know that it is not me, leaving everything to others." It can be seen that whether the blood, flesh, tendons, and bones covered inside our stinky skin are me or not is fundamentally still a question. Moreover, in the world, there was originally no such thing as me dozens of years ago; after dozens of years, there will inevitably still be no such thing as me. Just say that in these dozens of years, all the blood, flesh, tendons, and bones are nothing more than many animals and plants in the world, which have become human food, to build and change, and transform them; once breathing stops, they must still enter the soil, become plant fertilizer, grow leaves of grass and trees, and provide digestion for insects or nutrition for beasts. This is the situation of change, flow, circulation, and repetition of all things in the world, and it is the absolute truth in the human world.

Originally, the situation of change and flow between things and me, me and people, in the world is like water and gas, and gas and water. Therefore, the benevolent regard all things as one body, love people as their compatriots and cherish things, and feel each other's pain and joy, filled with infinite compassion and love, with no discrimination or killing at all. However, since humans have been obsessed with material desires, their innate intelligence has gradually disappeared. Therefore, everyone misunderstands and attaches special importance to their own link in the change and flow, and is very persistent, so that the more deeply rooted the ego becomes, the stronger the subjective becomes, making the entire world and humanity more ruthless than machines, more merciless than water and fire, expressing endless sins, and creating this unprecedented catastrophe.

Like Hitler, who rampaged across the world, swallowed the whole world, believed in being the only one to be respected, and attempted to be the only one to survive, where are those blood, flesh, tendons, and bones of his now? If he had any knowledge, could he not regret it? As the saying goes, "You bring nothing with you when you are born, and you take nothing with you when you die." Hitler, of course, could not be an exception to this, but what was particularly different about him was that he had another kind of "achievement" that he did not bring with him when he was born, but took with him when he died, that is, the sins of his life that were bigger than the sky, and the resentment that was deeper than the sea, which will always and forever be attributed to him. The reason why all national affairs, family affairs, and world affairs cannot be done well today is all due to the obstruction of the word "ego" in life, and all responsibility should be borne by this evil ego. With me but no one, you die and I live, specializing in taking other people's pain to generate their own happiness; specializing in taking other people's misfortune to cultivate their own happiness. Even specializing in wanting others to perish in order to maintain their own survival, so countries want to attack countries, and people want to attack people, and an unprecedented catastrophe is created here.

As the saying goes, "Put down the butcher knife and become a Buddha on the spot." What exactly is the butcher knife, and what is the Buddha? In fact, the butcher knife is me, and the Buddha is also me. As long as there is evil in my heart, I am the butcher knife; as long as there is good in my heart, I am the Buddha. At this critical juncture of life and death, at this extremely dangerous moment, the catastrophe of mankind is imminent, we must immediately put down the evil "ego" in our hearts, then the heart is the Buddha, and we can immediately realize true and authentic peace, and immediately obtain universal and thorough salvation. Do we want to go from death to life, or do we want to abandon life to take death? These two paths, which differ by a hair's breadth, should be carefully and cautiously chosen, and we must not let greed lead us astray again!
