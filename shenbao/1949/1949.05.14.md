### The Soviet Iron Curtain in the Far East; The Competition for Xinjiang's Provincial Affairs Is a Political Struggle Between China and the Soviet Union; The Soviet Union's Methods of Aggression Against Xinjiang May Differ, but Its Goal Remains Consistent

[United States New Opening Office, New York, 11th dispatch] The Chinese-language program of the "Voice of America" radio station featured Guo Yunkui speaking on "The Soviet Iron Curtain in the Far East." Below is the fifth installment of his speech:

The political solution to the Kazakh rebellion in Xinjiang is an embarrassing result of the Soviet Union's two-faced policy towards China. Because the Chinese government was preoccupied with the communist party problems in North China and Central China, it decided to take a conciliatory attitude towards the Xinjiang rebels, asking the Soviet Consul-General in Dihua to mediate and seek compromise. After Sheng Shicai was removed from his post as Chairman of Xinjiang, Wu Zhongxin succeeded him. Then, Zhang Zhizhong was appointed by the central government. In order to achieve the goal of a political solution, Zhang was willing to make all possible concessions to the rebels, only seeking to ensure that China's sovereignty was maintained. At a conference in Dihua in 1947, Zhang Zhizhong declared that "the central government is willing to return all political power to the people of Xinjiang, but only asks that the nation's territory and sovereignty be preserved intact."

After seven months of negotiations and haggling between the Chinese government and the Yili rebels, an agreement was finally signed in January 1946. According to this agreement, the rebel army recognized China's suzerainty and the central government's right to send troops to protect Xinjiang's border security and prevent foreign aggression. The Chinese government, on the other hand, granted the rebel army a very high degree of autonomy, including the right to organize six regiments of officers and soldiers to maintain local security, and the right to elect all councilors of local councils in each administrative region, and to elect 15 of the 20 members of the Xinjiang Provincial Government.

According to Professor McLean's detailed account in his article "Xinjiang Today," the Chinese government was able to abide by the provisions of the agreement and held free elections at the end of 1946. Most of the elected representatives were local Uyghurs who were already working in the provincial government. However, the rebel army failed to fulfill its promises. To date, the Chinese government's troops have not been able to enter the three administrative regions of northern Xinjiang, which are still in the hands of the rebels and controlled by the Soviet Union. Zhang Zhizhong also reported that "According to the agreement, six regiments of troops could be stationed in the three administrative regions of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan, but these troops were not reorganized by the government as stipulated in the agreement."

Ahemaitijiang, the Vice Chairman of Xinjiang, was a key agent who had been trained in the Soviet Union and sent to Xinjiang to engage in activities. He and Kesimofu and Saber were all key figures in the pro-Soviet left wing, or rather the Yining Group organized by the Soviet Union. Xinjiang also had a right-wing pro-China Islamic Group, led by Masud, Burhan, and former Heshuite chieftain Amin, who were deeply shocked by the growing influence of the Soviet Union in the so-called "national liberation movement" in Central Asian Turkey.

When Zhang Zhizhong, the Chairman of Xinjiang Province, was transferred to the post of Northwest Administrative Officer in June 1947, and Masud, a central committee member for many years who came from a landlord and merchant family in Xinjiang, was appointed by the central government as the new Provincial Chairman, the Yining Group deliberately expressed dissatisfaction, rose up in opposition, and prepared to take action. According to a note in the article "The Straits of Xinjiang" in the December 1947 issue of "Pacific Affairs," this Yining Group, guided by the Soviet Union, protested against Masud's appointment, but was defeated by a small margin. Masud finally officially took office as the Chairman of Xinjiang in late June 1947, but then the political situation in Xinjiang began to shake again. In mid-July, a riot broke out in Turpan, southwest of Dihua. By August 26, the leaders of the Yining Group had withdrawn from Dihua. By the end of October, the Yining army seemed to threaten Dihua again. As Professor McLean pointed out, these traitors were once again preparing to try again, just like the attempt in the autumn of 1945.

The Soviet bosses behind the Yining rebels were not satisfied with this. Professor McLean clearly pointed out that under the pressure of Soviet-backed extremists, these local so-called "nationalists" who were instigated by the Soviet Union engaged in mostly anti-Chinese or anti-Han activities, with fiery speeches, collective strikes, and hostile demonstrations. Zhang Zhizhong, in his capacity as the Chairman of Xinjiang Province, toured southern Xinjiang in May 1947. His impressions were reported at a conference in Dihua attended by representatives of Yining, and were later published by the Xinjiang Daily on August 14, 1947, and reprinted by the Dagong Daily from August 25 to 30, 1947. He declared, "Regarding the situation in Shufu, I can say that the local atmosphere is now very unfriendly to the interests of our country and our national army. If this continues, all our efforts to implement the agreement and maintain the prestige of the provincial government will be destroyed. I hope that the Shufu authorities will no longer ignore the interests of the whole country based on the interests of one party and one faction." Professor McLean also specifically pointed out that the Soviet consulates often used sophisticated and modern propaganda techniques to support the Yining rebel group. The Yining Group, directed by the Soviet Union, had been mobilizing many primary school teachers, doctors, technicians, and people from the middle and lower classes of society in Xinjiang. Their propaganda particularly emphasized the "ethnic" and cultural relations between the Uyghurs of Xinjiang and the neighboring Soviet Socialist Republics.

Zhang Zhizhong's main means of politically resolving the Xinjiang rebellion, which represented Soviet interests, was a conciliatory attitude. Zhang said, "Because Vice Chairman Ahemaitijiang and other Yining members of the provincial government formed only a minority, I could not hope to pass any proposals they put forward. Therefore, I never used my power to put their proposals to a vote. Whenever I encountered disagreements with the minority opinion, I always used negotiations and concessions as examples, so many that I could not list them all. As a result, outsiders mistakenly believed that I could not prevent the Yining Group from controlling everything in Xinjiang." But Zhang Zhizhong admitted in his speech the failure of his conciliatory attitude towards the Soviet-controlled Yining Group. He said, "Despite all the concessions and efforts I have made to seek cooperation in provincial affairs, the situation in Xinjiang has really transitioned from military conflict to political antagonism. In this sense, the illusion of a political solution has to be transformed into the reality of a political struggle."

The competition for Xinjiang's provincial affairs is a political struggle between China and the Soviet Union. Professor McLean pointed out that if there was no external interference, the right-wing pro-China Islamic Group might have prevailed over the left-wing pro-Soviet so-called nationalist group. But the future of Xinjiang depended on the comparison of the total pressure that the Chinese central government and the Soviet government could exert on the province. Professor McLean pointed out that the Yining Group, with the support of the Soviet Union, already had great influence in Xinjiang in terms of personnel administration and routine provincial affairs. This can be confirmed by Zhang Zhizhong's speech, in which he said that at the election of commissioners of various administrative regions held in 1947 according to the terms of the agreement, "The provincial government had already announced all the rules so that it could be implemented quickly, but Vice Chairman Ahemaitijiang and other Yining provincial committee members suggested delaying the process, because they knew that if the election was held at that time, their group would not be able to control it, and they would not be able to express any opinion if the administrative chiefs of various regions they did not like were re-elected." Zhang Zhizhong also made similar complaints, saying that the Yining Group prevented him from turning Xinjiang College into the national Tianshan University, the unified currency system, and the plan to extend the existing railway to Dihua. The Yining Group's tricks were clearly intended to sever Xinjiang from China, promote Soviet interests in Xinjiang, and prepare to drag Xinjiang behind our country's iron curtain again.

The political solution to the Xinjiang rebellion has completely failed. The so-called "East Turkestan Republic" under the wing of the Soviet Union still exists and is trying to expand. Professor McLean reported that the Yining rebel government had established a special administrative system, collecting taxes, publishing newspapers and propaganda, and training regular troops. Zhang Zhizhong admitted that even as early as January 1946, after the signing of the agreement, the three regions of Yining, Tacheng, and Ashan "still maintain a special status. We deeply feel that if this special situation lasts for a long time, the disintegration of other ethnic groups will be even more likely." Professor McLean also emphasized this crisis, saying that the Soviet Union has economic and geographical advantages over China and can exert pressure on Xinjiang. "Unless the anti-Soviet forces within Xinjiang can receive external support, Xinjiang seems likely to be controlled by the Soviet Union again."

I have clearly analyzed in previous broadcasts that the Soviet Union's goal of aggression in Xinjiang has always been consistent, but the methods of aggression have varied from time to time. For example, Sheng Shicai's rule, the Kazakh rebellion, and the one-sided political solution were all just aspects of the Soviet Union's policy of aggression.

### Legislative Yuan Passes Important Resolution; Supports Government's Continued War Effort; Levies US$1 Billion from Song, Kong, Zhang, and Jiaao

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th dispatch] The Legislative Yuan continued its 19th meeting on the afternoon of the 13th, chaired by Luo Heng, with 196 members in attendance. The meeting passed a "Resolution Supporting the Government's Continued War Against the Chinese Communists for Undermining Peace," as well as a "Resolution to Establish a Committee to Investigate the Yuan's Affairs" and a temporary motion to "Levy US$1 Billion from Mr. Song Ziwen, Mr. Kong Xiangxi, and Mr. Zhang Jiaao." The selection of the members of the Yuan Affairs Investigation Committee was extensively discussed at the meeting. Finally, a resolution was passed to have the chairman nominate 15 people, who would be approved by the assembly. The assembly also passed a resolution to hold a closed-door seminar on the morning of the 14th before adjourning. The assembly also passed a resolution to hold a closed-door seminar on the morning of the 14th.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th dispatch] The Legislative Yuan passed the "Resolution Supporting the Government's Continued War Against the Chinese Communists for Undermining Peace" at its 19th meeting on the 13th. This case was submitted to the assembly for approval after being reviewed by 13 members, including Xu Yuanquan. The original text of the resolution is recorded as follows: "Since the beginning of this year, the government has followed public opinion, advocated peace, and exercised the utmost sincerity in tolerance, hoping to achieve a fair, reasonable, comprehensive, and lasting peace. The Yuan previously held a meeting in Nanjing, where it resolved to unanimously support the government's peace-seeking policy and called on the Chinese Communists to cease hostilities. Unexpectedly, during the peace talks, the Chinese Communists put forward their so-called eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the "Domestic Peace Agreement," setting a deadline for acceptance, and then launched an offensive, crossed the Yangtze River, expanded the war, and massacred the people. The responsibility for undermining peace should be borne by the Chinese Communists. The facts are all there and are obvious to all the people. Based on past experience, the members of this Yuan deeply understand that the Chinese Communists' attempt is to subvert the country and enslave the people. To reiterate: (1) The war launched by the Chinese Communists is an international war of aggression, not a simple domestic war; (2) The Chinese Communists are fighting against all the freedom-loving people. This war is not a war between parties, but a war between good people and violence; (3) The Chinese Communists are seizing power by violence, and their purpose is to destroy democracy and implement totalitarian politics; (4) Under the control of the Chinese Communists, not only is the people's life and property not guaranteed, but families are broken up, ethics are disrupted, and the people have no possibility of living freely. Our people across the country, in order to fight for survival, for freedom, for human justice, to defend our homes, and to maintain national independence, should rise up in unison, support the government in strengthening the anti-communist front, and fight to the end until the Chinese Communists abandon their dream of conquering by force and achieve final victory."

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th dispatch] During the 19th meeting on the afternoon of the 13th, the Legislative Yuan passed a temporary emergency motion by 49 members to levy US$1 billion from Mr. Song Ziwen, Mr. Kong Xiangxi, and Mr. Zhang Jiaao in order to save the crisis and quell the communist rebellion. The original text of the motion stated: "The Communist Party is ruining the country and undermining peace. The government has moved south, and the military situation is becoming increasingly urgent. Therefore, the national crisis is serious and has reached a stage that brooks no delay. All compatriots should contribute money and strength in order to jointly overcome the crisis. At this critical juncture, "taxation" and "waiting for aid" are not allowed by time. Therefore, it is proposed to levy a total of US$1 billion from Mr. Song Ziwen, Mr. Kong Xiangxi, and Mr. Zhang Jiaao, with half of it used for military expenses and half as a fund for reorganizing finance, in order to save the crisis and quell the communist rebellion. After the recovery of the national territory, the national treasury will repay the full amount. Is this appropriate? Please decide." When this temporary emergency motion was put forward, it was met with warm applause from all the members present, expressing their support, and was subsequently passed without objection.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th dispatch] The Legislative Yuan is scheduled to hold a closed-door seminar on the morning of the 14th.

### Central Agencies in Xinjiang Maintained by Temporary Loans from Provincial Government

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 12th] The central agencies stationed in Xinjiang have been experiencing extreme difficulties in maintaining operations due to the recent interruption of supplies. They previously jointly borrowed money from the provincial government to overcome the current difficulties. The Xinjiang Provincial Government today passed a resolution in a meeting to temporarily loan money to maintain the central agencies. Institutions with their own income, such as the Telecommunications Bureau and the Postal Bureau, are allowed to borrow five yuan in currency per employee and one yuan and five jiao per worker. Institutions without their own income, such as the Diplomatic Office and the Supervisory Office, in addition to borrowing cash, are also allowed to borrow 55 jin of flour per person, starting from May. In addition, the gold yuan notes allocated by the central government for the salaries of the national army stationed in Xinjiang will be handed over to the Lanzhou Office of the Xinjiang Commercial Bank to purchase materials and transport them to Dihua. The provincial government will pay silver dollars of the same value in Dihua to reduce the circulation of gold yuan in Xinjiang Province.

### US Orders Stop to Dismantling of Japanese War Industries; Our Restitution Work Not Affected

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Reparations from Japan to the Allied countries are about to be stopped according to the policy of the United States. The reparations that Japan has paid so far are only worth more than 23.9 million US dollars, which is far from what was suggested by the most generous Johnston Report and the moderate Strack Report. The US side's previous suggestions on the amount of Japanese reparations are as follows: In April 1947, the Joint Army-Navy Committee roughly based on the figures suggested in the Pauley Report, which was 616,448,000 US dollars. In February 1948, Strack suggested 412,040,000 US dollars. In April 1948, the Johnston Report suggested 165,561,850 US dollars. Our Reparations Delegation to Japan issued a statement this morning stating that only a portion of the equipment of the army and navy arsenals belonging to the Japanese government has been dismantled and shipped as reparations, while other private war industries have remained untouched.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] Since the news that the United States has decided to stop all reparations work in Japan was released, the stock market here has had a violent reaction this morning. The stocks of major Japanese military factories and heavy industries have all soared in unison.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] After the news that the US government ordered the cessation of dismantling Japanese war industries as reparations, Tokyo was filled with optimism. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida happily declared at a press conference this afternoon that Japan's international status has gradually improved, and the US decision to stop Japanese reparations is a clear proof of this.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] If the US order to stop dismantling Japanese war industries as reparations becomes the final reparations policy of the Far Eastern Commission, then the work of Japan's reparations to the Allied countries will be declared over in early November of this year. There is no doubt that this US order will affect any decisions of the Far Eastern Commission on Japanese reparations. When the reporter asked Wu Bannong, the head of our Reparations Delegation to Japan, whether this decision by the United States would affect our country's restitution work in Japan, Wu replied: Reparations and restitution are two completely different things, so the restitution work should not be affected by this. Wu said: The restitution work is scheduled to end in March next year.

### Editorial: Protect the Next Generation

In the past few days, Shanghai's public and private schools at all levels, hoping that the military would not be stationed in the schools, or to avoid the school buildings being used as wounded soldier hospitals. The principals have jointly requested the Director of Education to protect education and protect the next generation. The principals are usually troubled by the rice, oil, firewood, and vegetables of the teachers and students, and cannot break through a bright path. Recently, they have been running around for the school buildings. They are sweating profusely, full of worry and anxiety, entrusting people with favors and saying good words everywhere, hoping to preserve the schools and keep the sound of strings uninterrupted, but they still inevitably encounter closed doors and are rebuffed. Their good intentions are truly worthy of our infinite sympathy.

In the past, because the social organization was not sound, the people's vision was too short-sighted, the soldiers' knowledge was not very high, the school's responsibilities were not fully fulfilled, the military and education were disconnected, the military and the schools were alienated, and they were following the path of "emphasizing generals in wartime and emphasizing ministers in peacetime", which invisibly created the outdated concept of "education is the least important". Some people even say that Shanghai currently only needs the Bureau of Social Affairs to stabilize the interior and the Police Bureau to resist foreign enemies, and other bureaus seem to be superfluous. In fact, they did not think that society is a whole organic body, and the Police Bureau and the Bureau of Social Affairs are like a person's hands and feet, and if the hands and feet are sound, but the brain, stomach, and blood vessels are weak, how can the hands and feet be strong alone, not to mention that the actions of the hands and feet all depend on the command of the brain, the nourishment of the stomach, and the circulation of the blood vessels. Education is like the brain of people. Therefore, President Chiang Kai-shek said during the War of Resistance against Japan: There are three elements of national construction: first, education, second, military force, and third, economy. And education is the general hub of military force and economy. Because both military force and economy must be produced and nourished by education to complete their missions. No wonder civilized countries must attend the last class in the midst of gunfire before they are willing to stop.

In the past, the educational administrative authorities had very little contact and very little relationship with the military and schools, military affairs and education, and had no policy and no plan. Even if there were policies and plans, they often did not work. As a result, they often embrace Buddha's feet when things come to a head, treat the head when it hurts, and the head still hurts, treat the feet when they hurt, and the feet are difficult to heal. In the end, they are often at a loss and end up doing nothing. On the surface, it seems that the schools are suffering and the students are suffering; however, when settling accounts, to put it mildly, this debt must also be written in the record of the victory or defeat of the war. To put it mildly, the nation-state suffers hidden losses.

Sun Tzu's Art of War says, "To subdue the enemy's army without fighting is the best of all." For the military unit, they are still reluctant to break it, for the education that is tied to the lifeblood of the nation, if it can be preserved, why not preserve it. Sun Tzu's Art of War begins by saying: "Therefore, measure it by five things, and calculate it to find out its situation: one is the Way, two is the Sky, three is the Earth, four is the General, and five is the Law." He puts the "Way" first, he says, "The Way is to make the people agree with the ruler, so that they can die with him, live with him, and not fear danger." The "Way" is not an empty thing, it represents the relationship between the government and the people, and it is a tool to win the masses. Sun Tzu divides war into four levels, the first level of war is "attacking the enemy's plans," the second level is "attacking the enemy's alliances," the third level is "attacking the enemy's army," and the fourth level is "attacking the enemy's cities," and he considers "attacking the enemy's plans" to be the best strategy. "Attacking the enemy's plans" is to attack the heart, that is, modern political warfare, psychological warfare, and cold war. If used well, it can create a victory of "no wisdom and no courage." This kind of bloodless war is the most economical, but the most important thing is the "Way." This word "Way" is the only weapon to win the hearts of the people and the only capital to win victory. The people need education, and the government gives them education. This is "knowing what to give and taking, the reality of politics." This can "make the people agree with the ruler." This can win without fighting. At least be victorious in every battle when "attacking the enemy's army" and "attacking the enemy's cities."

There are more disadvantages than advantages to the military living in the city. When Zeng Guofan trained the Xiang Army, he established a simple standard in terms of quality. Don't use wandering soldiers and slippery soldiers. He said in his memorial that only those who choose "villagers who are strong, simple, and honest, training one person will gain the benefit of one person, and training one day will have the effect of one day." To Peng Xiaofang, Zeng Xianghai wrote: "Do not take those who are flashy, but seek those who are of the working class." This means that farmers from rural areas, who have preserved their inherent honesty and courage, and have not been contaminated with flashy habits, are more likely to be effective.

Wounded soldier hospitals should be prepared as soon as possible, but before the wounded soldiers arrive, it is still advisable to leave space so that the original institutions can preserve their original work and do not have to occupy them all or use them for other purposes. It is said that 10,000 wounded soldier beds are needed now. The ten dance halls that have been prepared have about 3,000 beds, and the remaining 7,000 beds are only thinking about schools. In fact, there is no need to do this. Shanghai has plenty of entertainment venues and high-rise buildings. Why must we requisition schools and make millions of students drop out of school!

We must know that today, the schools in Shanghai have one school building used for several schools. Some have been used for six or seven schools. They lend classrooms to schools in the suburbs, and they also lend them to teachers and students of evacuated schools as a place to live. They also lend out instruments and books, and the corridors are full of refugee children. Their own students are divided into two sessions, morning and afternoon, to teach classes. If the military is stationed again, or it is converted into a wounded soldier hospital, the number of displaced schools is more than just one or two, and they are scattered throughout society. The impact is conceivable. We sincerely hope that the military authorities can still protect the next generation in the Taoist war!

### Artificial Lightning in Dense FogâSafely Guiding Airplanes to Land

(Specially Translated by the Guangzhou US Information Office)

Dazzling artificial lightning has recently been guiding airplanes to land safely in airports shrouded in dense fog in the United States. A row of light emitters, the size of cigarette boxes, near the Landing Aids Experimental Station in Arcata, California, emit lightning-like flashes that penetrate the extremely dense fog to guide airplanes to land on the runway. Soon, they will help large numbers of scheduled flights land at New York International Airport.

This new type of illuminant is important news in itself. However, there is a dramatic story behind its invention, which is particularly dramatic for the experimenter.

During the recent war, Ben Lahr, a Westinghouse researcher in Cleveland (in Ohio), spent much of his normal working time researching better new searchlights for the U.S. Navy.

As his beam experiment work progressed, he fantasized about the problem of light penetration through dense fog. When he had time, he worked with paper, pen, and slide rule. As a result, he came up with some mathematical answers to the problem.

Later, Lahr discovered his lightning source in a special "super light," which was invented by Westinghouse research engineers during the war for nighttime aerial photography. The lamp has a slender quartz tube filled with krypton, one of the naturally rare gases.

When a strong current of high-voltage electricity is emitted through the gas from a small artificial lightning engine, the lamp emits a dazzling flash. It has 900 candlepower per square inch, nine times stronger than sunlight. The lamp can indeed emit a flash that lasts 17 one-hundredths of a second, or about one-tenth of the emission time of natural lightning.

Lahr was convinced that the krypton lamp's flash could penetrate the densest fog. His next problem was to find out what effect this powerful flash would have on pilots' eyes.

He solved that problem in his two-car garage behind his house. He installed various flashes there, as well as various optical testing instruments and sensory recording equipment. In order to find experimental subjects, he invited his family and many friends, and gathered many young people from the neighborhood to visit his flashes. Local teenagers gave up their games to visit. Lahr slowly increased the intensity of the flashes until the children's eyes could not be opened.

While working with home equipment in his backyard laboratory, he discovered that when the eyes adapt to darknessâsuch as aviators flying at nightâthe retina is not affected by any changes in luminosity lasting less than one-thousandth of a second. From these experiments in the home laboratory, a mixed illuminator of krypton lamps and neon lamps was produced, which is the new type of light emitter of the Westinghouse Corporation.

Not long ago, a U.S. Air Force C-45 transport aircraft experienced engine failure over Cleveland. When the pilot communicated with the local airport by radio, he received the shocking news that the aircraft's height near the ground was limited to 300 feet. However, he decided to try to land. After three attempts to find the airport failed, as the airport personnel deployed the airport's instrument landing equipment and Westinghouse's experimental lightning, the pilot almost turned around, risking finding better weather. When the pilot tried to land again, he followed the signals of the instrument landing equipment and saw six dazzling flashes of light facing the airport. When the plane carrying seven airmen and 32 passengers safely reached the ground, the pilot told ground observers that he "could not have landed" without Lahr's artificial lightning.

### Taiwan Province Implements 37.5% Rent Reduction

[Taipei News] Although Chen Cheng has been in Taiwan as chairman for less than six months, his blueprint for governing this beautiful island is the most far-reaching and ideal. He first put forward the clear banner of "People First" and "People's Livelihood First", everything for the people, everything for the people. At the same time, in his think tank, he accommodated many experts who were familiar with and studied British politics, and wanted to transplant the socialist policies of the British Labor Party government to this treasure island along the center-left line, to do a good job, to thoroughly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, and to teach the 6.5 million people of Taiwan to grow up rich and happy.

Therefore, this year's major work in Taiwan is to promote the "37.5%" rent reduction movement, which is the initial work of implementing land reform. Chairman Chen Cheng has the greatest determination to promote the "37.5%" rent reduction, which is also the public opinion of the people of the province, and actively and thoroughly promotes it. April was for preparatory work, and May further lectured and cultivated a large number of cadres for promotion, so that every village in the province could understand the main points of the "37.5%" rent reduction: by June, all will be mobilized to sign lease contracts separately. There are 6,302 villages (li) in the province, and 15,000 people will be mobilized to promote this great work. At the same time, the provincial 37.5% rent reduction supervision committee will also be established, giving Taiwan an optimistic future.

Of the 6.5 million people in Taiwan Province, tenant farmers account for 2.6 million. In the past, landlords charged rents of up to 55% to 75%, and tenant farmers were really overburdened and exploited, and could not get enough to eat. Based on this fact and in response to the current needs, the Taiwan Provincial Government has prepared a method to make up for the past shortcomings, eliminate disputes between landlords and tenant farmers, and strive for future cooperation between landlords and tenant farmers. This method is very simple: (1) According to the regulations of the Executive Yuan, the rent should not exceed 37.5% of the total annual harvest of the main products. If the agreed rent exceeds 37.5%, it should be based on the agreement if it is less than 37.5%; (2) When the lessor recovers the leased land for self-cultivation in accordance with the law, the total area per household is limited; (3) The land tax and other donations paid by the landlord after the rent reduction are also reduced accordingly; (4) The land rent that was not measured last year should also be reduced in accordance with the "37.5%" rent reduction.

Now, all counties and cities in Taiwan are working hard to handle this work, and they have been supported by the farmers. Although the ignorant landlords have given resistance to the government's promotion of this great work, it is not great, especially in Pingtung in the south, the preparatory work for this "357" rent reduction has been done the most perfectly and well. Because the "37.5%" rent reduction work is not only beneficial to tenant farmers, but also provides security for landlords. Taiwan will smoothly complete this work of stabilizing people's livelihood and prospering society, and is now moving towards the bright and ideal road.

### Harmonizing Opinions on the German Question: Three Powers to Convene Meeting; Jessup and Bohlen Depart for Paris; Denying US Plan to Withdraw Occupation Troops from German Territory

[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 13th (Broadcast): Paris reports that upon arriving in Paris, US Ambassador-at-Large Jessup stated that the rumor concerning the US proposal to withdraw occupation troops from Germany "is inaccurate and easily leads to misunderstanding."

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] US Ambassador-at-Large Jessup and State Department German affairs expert Bohlen departed Washington by plane last night for Paris to hold a preparatory meeting with representatives from the UK and France prior to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. They were accompanied by two State Department German affairs experts.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 12th] "The New York Times" reported today that State Department Director of Long-Range Planning, Mr. Rynin, will propose at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference that the four countries' occupation troops be withdrawn and concentrated in three German ports. US troops would concentrate in Bremen, British troops in Hamburg, Soviet troops in Stettin, and French troops would be stationed in Strasbourg, within French territory. This matter has been confirmed by authoritative sources here. However, reports claiming that the four countries have already reached an agreement on this matter are inaccurate. Both the US and Soviet sides are unwilling to express their attitudes towards this proposal. The French Embassy in the US stated that as of noon today, they had not been informed of this news. US authoritative sources emphasized to our correspondent that this plan does indeed exist, but it is "merely a plan," and the reaction of France will be considered first. The same source also stated that the reaction or exploitation of this proposal by the French Communist Party will also be considered in advance, but if the Soviet Union agrees to this measure, the Communist Party will not likely express opposition. It is believed here that Jessup and State Department advisor Bohlen will discuss this matter.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 12th] The French Foreign Ministry stated tonight that it had not been informed of the proposal to concentrate occupation troops in three German ports and withdraw French troops to Strasbourg.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] It is said that the Western three powers are studying the issue of withdrawing occupation troops from various countries in Germany to German ports. British official sources were greatly surprised upon hearing this. Sources said that this move may have been proposed by a certain official in the US State Department, but it was stated with great certainty that the UK had never received this notification.

### US, UK, and France Approve New West German Constitution with Reservations; Political Affairs Temporarily Handled by Premiers of Eleven States

[United Press, Frankfurt, 12th] The Commanders-in-Chief of the US, UK, and French occupation forces today, in their capacity as military governors, approved the constitution passed by the Bonn Constitutional Assembly for the establishment of a West German government. It is generally believed that their taking this action within 24 hours of the lifting of the Berlin Blockade is a reaffirmation of the Allied determination to organize a West German government until a peace treaty is signed or until the Soviet side expresses its willingness to cooperate before a treaty is signed.

The Allied Commanders did not change the wording of the constitution, but made six reservations. The Allied Commanders also congratulated the Bonn Constitutional Assembly for completing this difficult task satisfactorily in difficult circumstances. Now that the constitution has been approved by the Allies, Germans will gradually hold elections, perhaps in mid-July, so that there will be a government outside of the two houses of parliament, with a president and a prime minister each. The Allied Commanders made the following reservations regarding the constitution: (1) To notify the Germans not to forget that both administrative and legislative powers are subject to the orders of the Allied occupation forces. (2) The federal government's power to requisition police from the West German states is limited to cases where special approval is obtained from the Allied authorities. (3) Not detailed. (4) The special power to change the borders of West Germany cannot be exercised until a peace treaty is signed. (5) To clarify that certain legislative powers granted by the German states to the federal government are subject to careful review by the Allies. (6) To cautiously limit the federal government's power to take over power from the states in order to achieve economic equality. The Allied Commanders neither approved nor rejected the Bonn Constitutional Assembly's plan to establish an eighteen-member "Executive Committee" to carry out government work pending the official establishment of the West German government. US Military Governor Clay said that this issue would be left to the administrative chiefs of the eleven states in the West German occupation zone.

The Location of the Capital Will Be Reconsidered

[Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 12th] Well-informed sources say that the heads of the occupation forces advocate adding Berlin to the Federal Republic of West Germany, making it the twelfth state, and will ask the chairmen of the local councils to be responsible for handling future political affairs until the West German government is established. Regarding the location of the government, the heads of the occupation forces also believe that it is inappropriate and require the representatives to reconsider their decision.

### West German People Care About Their Compatriots

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 12th] Representatives of the West German Constitutional Assembly spoke today at a gathering of 300,000 Germans in the American sector of Berlin, expressing concern that the entire Germany might be "Bolshevized" after the merger of the East and West zones of Germany. The leader of the Social Democratic Party group in the West German parliament, è¨å¯, will say that the current situation in the East zone and Berlin allows evil forces to enter West Germany freely. Bonn Constitutional Assembly Chairman Adenauer continued by saying that Berlin has become an outpost against the East, and the German people should not be overly optimistic or too pessimistic about the future. Christian Democratic Party's Kaiser declared that the majority of the motherland is still shrouded in darkness today, and said that the West German people have not forgotten their compatriots in the Soviet zone. Berlin Social Democratic Party leader Norman finally said that Germans are unwilling to be obedient. He vehemently criticized the Socialist Unity Party in the East German zone, saying that Hitler must have left behind some political methods in the presidential palace, which were being used by the Socialist Unity Party. He demanded that Eastern politicians withdraw from Berlin, "because their behavior is a work of sin from Hitler's regime."

### East German Publications Circulate; UK Zone Ban Remains

[United Press, Berlin, 12th] In the British sector of Berlin, eleven people were arrested on the 12th for distributing newspapers registered with the Soviet side. According to the Soviet-controlled ADN news agency, they were also beaten. This is the first major trouble since the lifting of the blockade. ADN news agency first disclosed this matter, and West zone police officers confirmed it but denied that those arrested had been beaten. During the Berlin Blockade, the Soviet Union banned the distribution of publications registered with the Allies in the Soviet zone, and the Allies retaliated with a similar ban. However, since the lifting of the blockade, the Soviet side has lifted this order, followed by the US, but the UK and France have not taken this action.

### Truman Expresses Satisfaction with the Lifting of the Berlin Blockade

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 12th] President Truman declared today while receiving reporters that the lifting of the Berlin Blockade is a welcome event in the world situation, and he is extremely satisfied with it. The President continued by saying that he absolutely supports Secretary of State Acheson's statement yesterday on the policy towards Spain. Regarding US domestic issues, Truman said that he still advocates completely and strictly abolishing the Taft-Hartley Labor Act, regardless of whether the labor unions are prepared to accept a slightly modified law. The President denied rumors that he had hinted at wanting to "purge" members of Congress within the Democratic Party who oppose his economic and social policies.

### On the Second Day After the Lifting of the Blockade, Trucks Pass Through Unimpeded

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 12th] Since the lifting of the Berlin Blockade, up to this morning, a total of 1,500 trucks and other motor vehicles have arrived in Berlin from West Germany, while only about 150 vehicles have arrived in Berlin from East Germany. Items transported from West Germany to Berlin by truck included vegetables and chemical products. Today, many street vendors were selling new potatoes, which could be purchased without ration coupons. According to well-informed sources, the British military government intends to ask the Soviet Union to allow an increase in the number of trains traveling between Berlin and West Germany. Currently, there are 16 trains running daily, including 3 military trains. The only incident that has occurred since the trains have been running is that the German Economic Commission in the Soviet zone did not allow the first mail train to Hanover to reach the Soviet zone, and the West zone municipal government has protested. No cargo ships from the West zone have arrived in Berlin yet. 2,000 cargo ships carrying a total of 92,000 tons of goods are waiting in Hamburg, ready to set sail for Berlin.

During this preliminary union period, mutual trade will be gradually increased, foreign trade and currency policies of the three countries will be systematically planned, and preparations will be made to establish a regime that can achieve common agreements. The three countries also agreed to plan for the abolition and reduction of various subsidies in their production, distribution, and consumption control policies.

### British House of Commons Approves Atlantic Treaty by a Large Majority; Bevin Explains That the Treaty Is Purely Defensive

[Agence France-Presse, London, 12th] The British House of Commons today approved the Atlantic Treaty by an overwhelming majority of 333 votes to 6. The opponents were two Communist Party members, two Independent Labour Party members, and two left-leaning Labour Party members. Another six Labour Party members abstained voluntarily. Foreign Secretary Bevin, in opening the debate in the House of Commons today, said that he believed the House of Commons, the entire British nation, and all peace-loving people in the world would accept the Atlantic Treaty. Bevin said, "Although the United Nations has been established, and peace treaties with Italy and Eastern European countries have been signed, we are still facing a group of Eastern European countries today. This group is the first deliberate action to create a division in Europe." Referring to the lifting of the Berlin Blockade, Bevin said, "The blockade will be lifted today. I firmly believe that the close unity of the countries of the Atlantic Treaty has made the Soviet Union reconsider its actions towards Berlin. The Soviet Union's policy is to call for peace while accusing others of inciting war, but at the same time, it creates unease in various countries. In view of this situation, we have no choice but to believe that all people who share the same will and are seen as targets for destruction should unite, not to attempt to attack but only to defend. The Soviet Union's totalitarian methods have enabled peace-loving people to gain a greater understanding and unite more closely." Referring to the Atlantic Treaty, Bevin said that if the government did not take measures to ensure its defense, it would not be fulfilling its responsibility to the country and the world. He said that some people attacked this treaty as an aggressive weapon, but if this treaty had been established in 1914 and 1939, both past world wars could have been avoided. "I want to emphasize that the true purpose of the treaty is defense. We want to ensure that the situation between 1930 and 1941 does not happen again." In conclusion, Bevin said, "The North Atlantic Treaty is a measure for collective defense between several countries. I firmly believe that we have taken the greatest step towards peace. We will be defenders of peace and firmly oppose aggressors. We will gather all resources to raise the living standards of people around the world." After Bevin's speech, Conservative Party leader Churchill rose and said that he agreed with the Foreign Secretary's speech. He continued, "I am pleased that the Foreign Secretary does not regard the lifting of the Berlin Blockade as a major peace move." Churchill said that the opposition party also contributed to the Atlantic Treaty, and said, "We express our praise for the great task undertaken by the United States, as the United States is the main contributor to the creation of the Atlantic Treaty." Churchill continued by saying that the combined forces of the Atlantic Treaty, the Brussels Pact, and the European Parliament are the most solid guarantee for peace and security. Referring to the Spanish question, Churchill said that he believed that Spain's failure to participate in the Atlantic Treaty was a gap in Western European strategy. He said that he was pleased that the Foreign Secretary agreed to restore diplomatic relations with Spain. "At the moment, all I ask for is this point. I think it is better to send an ambassador openly than to adopt a 'black market' style of diplomacy."

### US Has No Obligation to Send Troops to Europe Under Defense Treaty

[United Press, Washington, 13th] It has been learned that the State Department is preparing to notify Congress in writing that there is no obligation to use US troops in Europe under the Atlantic Treaty. Through the cooperation of the proposed Atlantic Treaty Council and Defense Committee, efforts will be made in the cooperation of the production of military equipment, and broad strategic objectives may be discussed.

### Dutch Government Approves New Indo-Dutch Agreement

[Reuters, The Hague, 12th] The Dutch government announced today that it fully accepts the agreement recently reached between the leaders of the Netherlands and the Republic of Indonesia. Overseas Territories Minister Maææ stated to the House of Representatives today that future relations between the Netherlands and Indonesia should be based on sincerity and goodwill as their main factors. Although difficulties may still be unavoidable in the future, they will not be difficult to resolve.

### Political Committee Debates Italian Colonies Issue; Soviet and Indian Proposals Rejected; Arab Countries Blame UK for Disregarding Indigenous Interests

[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 13th (Broadcast): Lake Success reports that the UN Political Committee rejected the Soviet plan to resolve the three former Italian colonies by an overwhelming majority. The plan advocated granting Libya and Eritrea independence within five years, Somalia should be granted independence within ten years, and at the same time, the three places should be managed by administrators appointed by the UN Trusteeship Council, and certain areas should be designated as strategic areas and placed under the jurisdiction of the Assembly. The case was rejected due to the vigorous opposition of Western countries. Subsequently, the Political Committee also voted to reject the Indian proposal advocating joint collective trusteeship.

[United Press, Lake Success, 13th] The United Nations Political Committee completed its debate on the disposition of the former Italian colonies early in the morning of the 13th, and will reconvene at 10:30 a.m. to vote on whether to submit the Bevin-Sforza proposal to the United Nations General Assembly. The 59-nation Political Committee has been debating the issue for five weeks. The main proposal in the committee is the one proposed by the UK and supported by Western countries, the principle of which was agreed upon in London at the end of last week by British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Italian Foreign Minister Sforza. This plan is strongly opposed by the Soviet, Asian, and Arab groups. The plan would divide Libya among the UK, France, and Italy, and allow it to become independent within ten years. It would return Somalia to Italy and divide Eritrea between Abyssinia and British-Egyptian Sudan.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 13th] During last night's meeting of the Political Committee, representatives from the Philippines, Burma, Haiti, Poland, and the Soviet Union accused Bevin and Sforza of the agreement they reached on the disposition of the former Italian colonies, believing that this move was a "political conspiracy that did not respect the opinions of the indigenous people of the various colonies and disregarded the United Nations." The debate continued until 12:30 a.m., and will reconvene this morning to vote. Some people believe that this issue will continue to be debated in the General Assembly plenary session.

Arab Countries' Representatives Support Polish Proposal

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 13th] The United Nations Political Committee today passed Poland's proposal with 23 votes to 15 and 17 abstentions, asking the United Nations to reconsider the fate of the indigenous people in the former Italian colonies, especially the Bevin-Sforza plan. The plan was advocated for adoption by the Political Committee on Wednesday. Today, representatives from the Arab countries all voted in favor of Poland's motion. Countries such as China, France, and the UK voted against it. The United States, most Latin American countries, and Israel, which voted for the first time in the United Nations today, all abstained. Before submitting its motion, the Polish representative spoke out against negotiating prices outside the United Nations regardless of the interests of the indigenous people.

### Although the Berlin Blockade Has Been Lifted, British and American Air Lifts Continue; Clay Encourages Germans to Strive for Freedom

[United Press, Berlin, 12th] Although the Berlin Blockade has been lifted, Allied authorities and Germans are still watching the Russians with suspicion. The airlifts are still continuing, and their meaning is a warning that Western countries are prepared for a possible new war in the Cold War. Within hours of the lifting of the blockade, the Soviet Union launched a rather strong propaganda campaign to participate in the control of the Ruhr industrial zone.

It has been disclosed that the UK and the US have decided to continue the airlifts until Berlin has stored 200,000 tons of food, in order to prevent any Soviet trickery. In the 24 hours up to noon on the 12th, Allied aircraft flew a total of 1,008 sorties, delivering a total of 9,047 tons of supplies to Berlin.

[United Press, Berlin, 12th] Outgoing US Military Governor for Germany Clay told Berlin citizens today, who were joyfully celebrating the lifting of the blockade, that they had gained freedom and should unite with the German territory occupied by the Soviet Union to defend their freedom. Clay was giving a farewell speech at a special meeting of the Berlin West zone City Council, saying that he, like the Germans, eagerly hoped for the unification of Germany. The audience cheered thunderously upon hearing this. But Clay also warned, "But unification must never be achieved at the expense of the freedom guaranteed by the new Bonn Constitution." The Bonn Constitution was drafted by West German political leaders as the basis for a permanent West German government. The Germans in the Soviet occupation zone did not participate. Clay further said that the end of the blockade means more than just the fact that trains and trucks are running again. The people of Berlin have acquired the right to freedom, which will be accepted by freedom-loving people everywhere. The British and French military governors will all agree with us that, like you, we want to see a unified Germany, but the arrival of unification must never sacrifice the freedom guaranteed by the constitution that has just been passed in Bonn. The citizens of Berlin who chose freedom and are prepared to accept sacrifices to protect freedom, along with the pilots of the British and American airlifts, are the "true heroes of the blockade."

### US Orders MacArthur to Cancel Japanese Reparations; China, Philippines, and Other Countries Unanimously Oppose; US and China May Use Veto Power in Far Eastern Commission

[United Press International, Washington, 12th] The United States today abruptly ordered MacArthur to cease the transfer of Japanese machine tools and other industrial equipment to China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, as a new step toward restoring Japan's self-sufficiency. Simultaneously, US representative McCoy clearly announced to the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission that the United States would oppose any proposal to resume reparations payments and could use its veto power in the commission to block such a vote.

Japan needs all its resources to reduce its dependence on US aid. Japan and the US can no longer wait for Pacific nations to decide how much Japan can pay in reparations and how it should be distributed. Since MacArthur began pre-delivery of Japanese reparations goods in April 1947, approximately 20,000 machine tools dismantled from Japanese military factories have been transferred to China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Japan has also paid substantial reparations from its seized overseas assets, estimated by other officials to be no less than $3 billion. The Soviet Union obtained the most when the Red Army occupied Northeast China. Various countries have demanded tens of billions in reparations from Japan. The Philippines demands 15% of the total reparations, China demands 40%, Australia 28%, the United Kingdom 25%, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, and France 12% each, India 12.5%, New Zealand 2%, and Canada 11.5%. The US originally requested 29% but voluntarily relinquished it to be distributed among other countries and repeatedly urged all countries to reach an agreement as soon as possible.

[United Press International, Tokyo, 13th] MacArthur today declined to immediately comment on the US order to halt the shipment of Japanese reparations materials. While this unexpected move was welcomed by the Japanese, it has aroused opposition from spokespersons in China and the Philippines. According to a Chinese spokesperson, Japanese industries with war potential have not yet been touched. The US action on provisional reparations will likely clarify the entire reparations issue, which remains one of the major problems that the Allied nations must resolve.

US Suddenly Halts Japanese Reparations; Romulo Expresses Surprise

[United Press International, Lake Success, 13th] Carlos Romulo, head of the Philippine delegation to the United Nations, declared on the 12th that the US decision to halt the dismantling of Japanese factories for reparations was surprising. Four weeks ago, the Philippine government issued a statement to the Far Eastern Commission in Washington, requesting the US to determine Japan's reparations policy. He is now baffled by General McCoy's statement and is awaiting instructions from the government.

[United Press International, Tokyo, 13th] Emilo Abello, head of the Philippine mission to Japan, declared today that the US policy of halting Japan's continued transfer of reparations materials seemed paradoxical. In his personal opinion, the Japanese economy cannot bear the burden of idle factories. It is already teetering due to the heavy burden of economic subsidies and the scarcity of raw materials. While idle factories could be used by countries ravaged during the war, they cannot aid the Japanese economy.

UK Did Not Agree to Cancel Japanese Reparations

But Has No Means to Act Against US Decision

[Reuters, London, 12th] After news of the US decision to halt the acquisition of reparations materials from Japan reached London, the reaction here was quite cool. A Foreign Office spokesperson declined to comment on the matter. The decision was announced by US Major General McCoy, representative to the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission. It is said that the UK received brief notification beforehand. Foreign Secretary Bevin stated in the House of Commons yesterday that the UK had not agreed to cancel Japan's reparations. However, it was also pointed out that because the US Treasury bears the full cost of the occupation of Japan, the UK is not in a position to insist that Japan continue to pay reparations. In matters concerning Japan, the UK government's decision-making power differs from its decision-making power in matters concerning Germany. Therefore, if the US government ultimately decides to cancel Japan's reparations, the UK has no choice but to accept the decision. Observers also pointed out that the US abolition of the Far Eastern Commission's reparations plan could have two possible consequences: First, the Allied nations in the Far East will not receive reparations; second, the US policy of reviving the Japanese economy may neglect security considerations.

Full Text of US Statement

[US Information Service, Washington, 12th] The United States will no longer exercise the right to issue directives to continue authorizing the removal of equipment from Japan as reparations. US Major General McCoy, representative to the Far Eastern Commission, declared in a statement issued by the State Department today: "Japan's economic situation has developed to such an extent that if Japan is to achieve any degree of recovery, no more industrial equipment can be removed." McCoy said that this fact, coupled with the failure to resolve the reparations issue despite continuous US efforts, has prompted the US government to rescind its previous proposal to transfer preliminary reparations goods to the Allied nations. Officials here acknowledged that the implication of this statement is the termination of Japanese reparations and the cessation of the transfer of machinery and equipment to China, the United Kingdom, the Philippines, and the Netherlands under the preliminary transfer of reparations goods plan. They indicated that directives concerning this matter will soon be sent to General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in Tokyo. McCoy explained the main reasons for the US taking its current position as follows: "(A) Japan's economic deficit has little hope of being balanced in the near future, and achieving balance will ultimately require all the resources at Japan's disposal. (B) The burden of removing Japanese advanced reparations materials could have a serious impact on stabilizing the Japanese economy and allowing it to move toward the occupation goal of self-sufficiency. (C) Despite repeated US voluntary assistance in the past three years, the Far Eastern Commission has made little or no progress in drafting a schedule of reparations allocations. Without an agreement on a schedule of reparations allocations, all current policy decisions of the Far Eastern Commission on the issue of reparations cannot be implemented. (D) Japan has already paid considerable reparations by relinquishing its former overseas assets and has also paid smaller reparations under the pre-transfer plan." McCoy added: "In view of these conclusions, the US government has had to rescind the interim directive of April 4, 1947, and terminate the pre-transfer plan stipulated by that directive. At the same time, the US government has had to withdraw its proposal of November 6, 1947, regarding Japan's reparations allocations and notify the Secretary-General accordingly. Finally, the US government takes this opportunity to announce that it has no intention of taking further unilateral action under the authority of its interim directives to remove reparations materials from Japan." McCoy said: "Our current problem is not to restrict Japan's peaceful industries, but to revive those industries to supply Japan's minimum needs." He said that in order to solve this problem, the US recommends "allowing Japan to develop its peaceful industries without restriction." He declared that this development includes the use of "major war equipment," which has already been stripped of its "war equipment" characteristics. On this point, he continued: "The United States believes that all equipment, including the 'major war equipment' currently designated for reparations, that can contribute to Japan's recovery should be utilized. This equipment is essential to Japan's peaceful economy." However, he emphasized that the US continues to support the principle that Japan should not be allowed to restore its capacity to engage in war. The US plans to immediately request the Far Eastern Commission to pass recommendations concerning Japan that are consistent with the position he has explained. Regarding the government's current position on the issue of Japanese reparations, officials feel that the US has taken all reasonable steps to achieve a formal solution to the reparations issue, thereby creating in Japan a sense of stability necessary for industrial recovery. Among several related proposals for a solution, they recalled that in November 1947, the US submitted to the Far Eastern Commission a schedule of reparations percentages, listing the reparations amounts for all eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission. China and the United States were to receive the most. However, the US suggested that if other countries accepted the schedule, the US would be willing to relinquish its entire share of reparations to other countries. This suggestion, like other suggestions, was not accepted due to political factors.

### Lianxing Table Tennis Team Defeats Bank of China; Tonight, Quanlv Plays Qinglian

In the 4th Table Tennis League, Lianxing played Bank of China (ç²çµè¯æåºæ°ä¸­è¡) in the first division league the day before yesterday. Lianxing came on stage with five strong players, with a magnificent momentum and a state of easily defeating the Bank of China. Unexpectedly, the Bank of China had a strong fighting spirit and resisted bravely. Although the first and third groups were defeated, the main player Zhu Yongkang and the chopper Gao Zhonglin, each with an indomitable spirit, did not feel discouraged after losing the first game. They calmly responded to the battle, and sure enough, they turned the tide. They won two games in a row. The two successively defeated Lianxing's strong players Zhang Shanda and Chen Xingquan with a score of 2-1, winning back the second and fourth groups, making the Bank of China each tie at 2-2. The last group was the key to the survival of both sides. The Bank of China discovered that the strong player Wang Shaozeng was missing, so they had to send a reserve player Tu Guangrong to fight against Lianxing team leader Hu Yiping. Tu's skills were lower than Yiping's, so he was not an opponent of Yiping. He allowed the opponent to attack and was at a loss. In the end, he lost two games in a row. As a result, Lianxing won 3-2. Although the Bank of China lost this battle, the record was far better than before, and it can be said that they had done their best. The record of the two teams is explored as follows:

(Lianxing) Score (Bank of China)

Wu Zuojing

(21-14 21-19)

Zhu Guozhen

Zhang Shanda

(21-13 12-21 19-21)

Today (14th), there will be one first division match and two second division matches. In the first division, Quanlv will play against Qinglian. The latter has lost four matches in a row, and the morale has declined. Quanlv has defeated the Youwu Post Office and the Kunzhong Army of Post Office B. Under its command, in addition to the veteran Wang Yishan, who is already an outdated figure, the rest, such as Dai Yixing, Zhang Juchen, and Lu Yongkang, are full of energy and resourceful in combat. Qinglian must be cautious and careful in this battle, otherwise, it may still be difficult to escape the fate of defeat.

In the second division, Dagong will play against the seeded Ling team. Dagong has won against two weak teams. Today, under the supervision of team leader Xu Junyuan, they will definitely go all out to compete with the Ling team. It is expected that a fierce battle between the two sides is inevitable. In addition, in the second division two, Nongji B will play against You 18. The former has lost five battles in a row, and the spirit is very good. This battle is still not an enemy of You 18.

QuanlvââQinglian (First Division) 6:00 PM

DagongââLing Team (Second Division One) 7:00 PM

### Deliberation on Public Utility Pricing Methods; Decision to Temporarily Charge 680,000 Times; Revised Formula to Be Adjusted Every Half Month

[Central News Agency] The Shanghai Municipal Public Utility Fee Calculation Method Review Committee was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Mayor Chen, as chairman, briefly stated: Due to the increase in oil and coal prices, the calculation index of various public utility companies in the city is high, and users feel overwhelmed. However, in this difficult period, it is hoped that both the company and users will consider the difficult times, cooperate sincerely, understand and make concessions, and overcome the difficulties together. Subsequently, the Public Utilities Bureau reported on the cost calculation process. Senators, company and industrial association representatives all made statements, and the discussion was very enthusiastic. The two resolutions and the principles of the revised public utility pricing method passed are recorded as follows: Two resolutions: (1) For users who pay according to the announced public utility index, the part exceeding 680,000 times will be refunded by the company to the user. (Deducted from subsequent payments.) (2) For those who pay according to 370,000 times or 30%, and those who have not paid, from May 14th to the date of the announcement of the price based on the newly revised formula, all will be calculated and paid at 680,000 times. (Paid within three days of the company's bill being delivered to the user.)

Principles for Revising Public Utility Pricing Methods

(1) Please have the Central Bank, the US Economic Cooperation Administration's China Branch, the Shanghai Office of the Bituminous Coal Regulation Committee, and the Four Coal Mine Joint Operations Office adjust the prices of fuel coal and oil used by public utilities every half month thereafter. As for the prices currently set, they should also be reduced first. (2) Please have the Ministry of Finance exempt public utilities from import duties on fuel and equipment. (3) Please have the Central Bank continue to lend to public utilities at the rate of 600,000 US dollars in Gold Yuan per half month, and continue to lend according to the original method, for the turnover of various public utility companies. (4) In order to take into account the burden on the people and to maintain the survival of public utilities in the city, and to overcome the difficulties together, from now on, the pricing formulas for the four items of water, electricity, gas, and telephone should be re-determined according to the absolutely necessary expenses of various public utility companies, such as oil, coal, wages, taxes, and all miscellaneous expenses for maintaining business. Depreciation and profits will not be calculated for the time being. The Public Utilities Bureau will formulate a draft, which will be implemented after being approved by the Review Committee. (5) From the day after the implementation of the above pricing formula, the Public Utilities Bureau will calculate the amount of water, electricity, gas, and telephone charges based on the formula and the various market prices of the previous day, and announce them in the newspaper. In the future, the calculation and adjustment will be based on changes in the prices of various factors in the formula, and the principle will be to adjust it every half month for the time being. Users will pay within three days from the date the company's bill is delivered. (6) Factories that are willing to exchange oil or coal for water, electricity, and gas from the company may be allowed to do so. The Public Utilities Bureau will formulate the method and submit it to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation. (7) The oil or coal used by the company may be taken in advance and paid in installments, which will be handled by the Municipal Government in consultation with the competent authority. (8) All fares for public transportation will remain the same for the time being. The Public Utilities Bureau will formulate another pricing formula based on necessary expenses such as fuel and wages, but the principle will be to adjust it twice a month for the time being.

### To Maintain Factory Production, National Bank to Hold Temporary Industrial Loans; Various Industrial Associations Limited to Submit Rosters for Review This Morning

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the city entered a state of military emergency, factories have found it difficult to maintain operations due to sluggish sales, and the number of factories that have stopped or reduced production has been increasing.

### Land General Registration in Six Districts; Unfinished Parts; Procedures for Handling Set

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Land Administration Bureau is handling the land general registration business in six districts, namely Huangpu, Hunan, Zhabei, Yinxiang, Fahua, and Caohejing. Most of the work has now been completed, but there are still some cases of lost slips and damaged slips that have not been reported with the slip number, household name, and mu shares. There is also no circumstantial evidence available to verify whether the property rights are true. Although staff have been sent to conduct on-site investigations, it is still difficult to make a definitive determination quickly. In order to facilitate handling, the procedures for handling these cases are set as follows: (1) Order the owner to first set up a boundary and declare the loss of the property certificate in the newspaper, and then apply for measurement. (2) Draw a public announcement map according to the measurement results and post it on the announcement office in front of the gate of the bureau, the Baojia (ä¿ç²) office where the land is located, and the location of the land. A fee may be charged for this public announcement map. (3) For registration cases where the draft map has already been signed and confirmed, the aforementioned public announcement procedures should still be completed. (4) The public announcement map will be publicly announced for one month. If no one raises any objections after the expiration of the public announcement period, the owner shall obtain guarantees from the four neighbors or reliable shopkeepers and submit them to the bureau for verification. Those who already have guarantees must re-check the guarantees. (5) For all the above procedures that have been completed, refer to the precedent of land grading and tax assessment without grain department records, pay 40% of the prescribed land price, and issue a certificate of title. (6) All owners who fail to follow the above procedures will be rejected, and a public announcement of ownerless land will be processed immediately.

### Determination of Merchants' Profits for Purchasing Food from Suburban Areas

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Municipal Materials Adjustment Committee held a meeting at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 9:00 AM yesterday to discuss the issue of purchasing food from suburban areas. More than ten representatives from the Songhu Garrison Command, Social Affairs Bureau, Materials Adjustment Committee, North-South Rice Market, Rice Merchants Association, and others attended.

(3) To facilitate food merchants' procurement and transportation, the government will issue an order to the county governments and all units outside theè­¦æç¶« (guard lines), allowing merchants to freely purchase and transport food without any obstruction. (4) The Garrison Command will be requested to issue temporary passes for food merchants' food procurement and transportation.

### Various Parties Are Absorbing, and the Asking Price of Gold Is Rising Sharply

National Bank Sales Were Slightly Softer Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, in the gold market, because gold prices in other cities were high and far out of sync with the local market, various parties had strong buying interest, and there was a shortage of supply, resulting in chaotic asking prices. The market opened as high as 2.9 billion and once rose to the limit of 2.94 billion. The Central Bank quickly entrusted Dadecheng Gold Store to sell at a price of 2.9 billion yuan, pushing it down to 2.85 billion, releasing a total of 128 large bars. The rising trend slowed near noon and finally closed at 2.85 billion.

In the afternoon, because peers were rushing to pay the Central Bank's gold sales, they were not in the mood to trade. The Central Bank once again entrusted Dadecheng Gold Store to continue selling at a price of 2.8 billion, but no one accepted the offer, and nothing was sold, resulting in a further increase of 400 million compared to the previous day.

Another report: In off-market trading, gold opened flat in the morning, with asking prices of 2.4 billion and 2.6 billion, once rising to 2.8 billion and 3 billion. It closed at 2.7 billion and 2.9 billion at noon. The market opened in the afternoon at 2.75 billion and 2.95 billion, reaching a maximum of 2.85 billion and 3.005 billion, and then fell to 2.75 billion and 2.9 billion in the evening, a further increase of 450 million compared to the previous day.

Another report: US dollars stood out in off-market trading. Because it had been weak for a long time, it had an inverted spread with other cities. In recent days, people have been bringing cash to Shanghai to seek it out. In addition to the South China line, those coming and going from Suzhou and Wuxi were also absorbing it, and the sentiment was very firm. The trading was active, with the morning opening at 4.8 million and 5.3 million, rising to 5.3 million and 5.8 million. It closed at 5 million and 5.5 million at noon, and once hit 5.5 million and 6 million in the afternoon. The final asking price was 5.3 million and 5.8 million, an increase of 1.1 million compared to the previous day.

Another report: Yesterday, the price of gold ornaments in jewelry stores also increased due to the rising gold price, reaching 50 million, rising to 260 million and 300 million. Silver ornaments also rose by 500,000, reaching 2.5 million and 3.5 million. There was no change in the afternoon.

### Silver Dollar Market Trend Turns Firm

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the silver dollar market was trending firm because the authorities were going to equalize the negotiated prices, and the Central Bank would start listing prices from next week. In general, silver dollar trading was about to move again. Most commercial firms had also temporarily suspended trading, and asking prices of 3.8 million for buying and 4 million for selling were rarely seen.

Even if there were asking prices, they would say they had no incoming stock and no goods to offer to the market.

Another report: The exchange between gold and silver did not change much, with the high end trading at 49 and 52, and the low end trading at 45 and 48. The common rate was 47 and 52, an increase of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. The exchange rate between gold and banknotes was calm, still at 52 and 54. The exchange between banknotes and silver had leveled out. At times, US dollars were trading at 10 yuan, rising from 8.5 yuan and 9 yuan all the way to 8.8 yuan and 9.3 yuan, and then rising to 9.5 yuan and 10.05 yuan in the afternoon. Ornaments being exchanged for silver dollars were trading at 47 and 52.

Another report: Yesterday, silver coins turned stronger after being weak. The price was stable in the morning with little fluctuation. In the afternoon, because gold and banknotes rose sharply, sentiment turned positive. Vendors were reluctant to sell. 20-cent coins were asking as high as 150,000 and 200,000, 10-cent coins rose to 70,000 and 100,000, and 5-cent coins were also popular at 30,000 and 50,000, an increase of 10,000 to 20,000 compared to the previous day.

### Rice Market Initially Strong, Then Weak

Yesterday's rice market was initially strong, then weak. The morning opened with owners initially asking higher prices due to the continued scarcity of arriving goods. However, because of the imminent distribution of household rice, rice shops' actual sales were sluggish, and the market gradually turned downstream. High-quality white japonica rice barely held steady at 41 million yuan wholesale. Other medium and low-quality rice fell by 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. Thin indica rice fell slightly by 500,000 yuan, and the North City also saw a decline, with white japonica rice falling by 2 million yuan, retreating to 42 million yuan.

Miscellaneous grains continued to rise, with soybeans rising by 10% to 20,000. Mung beans had active sales, also rising sharply by 10%. Raw peanuts opened at 4 million, and Linhuaiguan opened at 36 million. There were few transactions for rice in bags, and red sorghum did not open.

Flour continued to rise. Because the market price was far out of sync with the price of rice, suppliers were trying to catch up, and asking prices were extremely high. Inbound wholesalers were quite eager, and many stopped absorbing at the high prices, so the market was at a stalemate. Furthermore, with the surge in gold and banknotes, sentiment became even tighter, and market prices generally strengthened by 10%. Old-brand flour was priced at 11.5 million, and Bingchuan (military ship), Hongfeng (red bee), and Jiancheng (built city) were all priced at 10.5 million, and Dafa was priced at 11.1 million.

The price of edible oil continued to rise sharply. It was heard that prices of various external commodities were rising sharply, and those in charge were strongly raising prices. The market price jumped by 10 million. Factory-pressed bean oil opened at 140 million in the morning, once trading as high as 160 million, but individual investors sold at the high prices, falling back by 10 million. Dayou closed at 150 million in the afternoon. The price of raw oil rose even more sharply, with factory-produced raw oil rising to 160 million, and the price of raw rapeseed oil rose more moderately. Dayou closed at 125 million.

### Cotton Yarn Apparently Increasing But Actually Decreasing

The cotton yarn market yesterday saw weak sentiment and increased supply. The market initially stabilized and then softened. However, because external financial items were strengthening, prices were driven up, but in terms of gold conversion, it was apparently increasing but actually decreasing.

42-count Blue Phoenix opened at 98 million, and various groups sold off in succession. Local wholesalers reduced their buying interest, and the market softened, falling to 92.5 million at noon. 40-count and 31-count were initially high and then low. 21-count Double Horse spot goods opened at 54 million, and there were many sellers, and the market was flat and soft. Later, there was a slight increase in buying interest, and the asking price rose slightly, closing near noon at 60 million. The trend for 20-count and below was mediocre.

### Cotton Cloth Unchanged

The cotton cloth market continued to be unchanged. A large amount of cloth distributed to employees of China Textile Mills and other factories as salary compensation poured out, and the market continued to decline. Local peers still had weak sales and showed no interest in buying. Even though gold and banknotes were rising, sentiment remained weak.

Longtou fine cloth initially opened low at 16.8 million, and then fell back to 16 million, a decrease of 1 million compared to the previous day. Four Gentlemen poplin fell from 17.4 million to 16.4 million, a decrease of 1.2 million. Low-end cloth also proved unsustainable. Longtou B and Dashuanglong fine cloths each fell by another 600,000, and Fufu traded at 14.4 million, falling by 800,000. Longmen fine cloth closed at 13.6 million. The buying interest for Four Gentlemen Yuanfu silk was slightly active, initially trading at 26.4 million, closing at 26 million at noon, an increase of 800,000 compared to the previous day. The market for privately-owned factories remained flat and weak.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Fan Zhaoding, an employee of the China Trust Bureau Life Insurance Department, lives at No. 46 Hongqing Lane, Heping Road. He is married to Fang, and his mother, Zhang, is nearly seventy years old. Recently, because Fan planned to move to Guangzhou with the bureau, Zhang was unwilling to go with him due to her old age, so the old and young had conflicting opinions. A fierce quarrel broke out one night a few days ago, and then they went to bed. Fan's eldest son, Zhongyin, slept with his grandmother in the same bed. When he got up the next morning, he called for his grandmother, but she did not respond. Fan and others rushed to look and found that Zhang had hanged herself in the bed. At that time, Fan reported the death to the police station and the district office, but did not explain that it was a suicide, and he had the coffin prepared himself.

### Before and After the Fall of Hangzhou

â Green Continent

[Report from Our City] On the morning of May 1st, around 4:00 AM, Hangzhou was awakened from its slumber by intense artillery fire. Citizens explored the source of the artillery fire with heavy hearts. After dawn, the shops did not open, and the streets were desolate. There were very few silver brokers in the Guankou area, and the big head price plummeted. No one wanted the Gold Yuan, and scattered transactions were priced in silver dollars. A set of big cake and fried dough sticks was being bargained for at two jiao. However, the price of rice was very cheap, about four yuan per dan. There were almost no pedestrians on the street, only the occasional fire truck patrolling and speeding by, which was heartbreaking. However, all newspapers were still operating as usual, competing to publish extra editions, which sold exceptionally well. Generally, people embraced the idea that a storm was coming and accepted it calmly.

On the evening of the 2nd, the rumbling of artillery fire was intermittent. By the morning of the 3rd, it had completely turned into a silent state. The air was very quiet, as if the storm had already passed. The day was sunny and clear. Citizens probed their heads into the streets with a strange feeling, talking to each other and inquiring. In order to clarify the truth, the author specifically visited the New Gathering Group of the 77th Division in the Army Hospital near the Dafosi Temple. However, the Zhenglu, Hubin, and Municipal Government areas were under martial law, and large trucks loaded with materials passed by in succession. After the author showed his credentials, it took a lot of persuasion to get through to the vicinity of the Municipal Government. A temporary police officer of the Self-Defense Force told me that the Communist army had reached Luodianzi, forty li from the city, and traffic on the Songmu Pasture area had been cut off. After arriving at the New Gathering Group, the house had been emptied, with only a few soldiers still sorting out the remaining items. When I inquired with them, I got nothing, and they only said that the Communist army was still forty to fifty li away. So I took a car to the Provincial Government Secretariat and other relevant agencies, but they were also ordered to evacuate on the evening of the 2nd, and the rooms were empty and desolate, realizing the seriousness of the situation.

The last train to Shanghai left at noon, fully loaded with military families and rushed to transport items. Most of the refugees were blocked outside the station and unable to board the train. From about 4:00 PM, suddenly there were several loud explosions. After the author inquired, I found out that the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command and the team had withdrawn from Hangzhou to a new position. At about 5:00 PM, the communication with Shanghai was interrupted. At about 6:00 PM, a notice from the "Revolutionary Committee of the Kuomintang" was posted on the street, announcing that citizens should operate their businesses with peace of mind, not disturb themselves, and assist the Communist army in entering the city and taking over various agencies and public utility institutions, etc. The notice was issued by Zhang Tianyi, Chief Captain of the Hangzhou City Security Brigade, and Deputy Captain Zheng Yuming. It was also rumored that the Communist army's advance troops of more than 4,000 people had arrived at the Municipal Government and the Hubin Hotel area. The order among the citizens was still good. In the evening, suddenly saw red light filled the sky in the direction of the Songmu Pasture, and black smoke obscured the sky, and there were sparse gunshots. The actual situation was unclear, but the general citizens became panicked again, carrying boxes and cages to escape. I hired a tricycle with my old mother at the cost of one big head yuan to take temporary shelter at the home of my friend Zhou at Wulong Temple, South Xingqiao. The car was blocked by crowded citizens and boxes of belongings on Shuishi Street, Cangqiao Street, Fengshanmenwai Street, and South Xingqi. It was already 1:00 AM when we arrived at Zhou's house. I heard that there were ships at the Sanlang Temple Yidu Wharf that could go to Haiyan, so I accompanied my old mother to the riverbank. However, the refugees on the riverbank rushed to board the ship first, and the cries of wives being separated from their husbands and children were heartbreaking. It was not until about 4:00 AM on the 4th that I hired a double-masted fishing boat at the cost of seven big head yuan and one mace heavy gold ring. Fourteen people on the same boat shared the boat fare. There was an old man in tattered clothes on the boat. After talking, I found out that he was the principal of a certain middle school in Hangzhou, and he was deeply saddened by everything the Communist army did when they entered the city.

After boarding the boat, because I was very tired from running around all day, I fell into a drowsy state and left Hangzhou in the glaring sunlight of the 4th. The Jiangnan escape boats were incessant. The green waves were rippling, and the distant mountains were distinct. With a heavy heart, I left Hangzhou, looked into the clouds, and unbidden emotions arose.

### Wedding of a Tianshan Mongol Prince

â Gong Juemin

Spring Melody Begins

When mentioning Prince Ban, every Mongol nomad in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains praises him as a hero. He was the leader of the Heshuote tribe on the northwest bank of Bosten Lake. He was born exceptionally brave. According to Dorji, the deputy head of Heshuk County and a progressive Mongol youth who studied in the Soviet Union, Prince Ban personally led a Mongol legion in Yanqi, defeated He Jiani Yazi, and then fought against Commander Ma Zhongying. Just as Ma Zhongying was being utterly defeated and struggling, Sheng Shicai, using his usual charge of "conspiracy and riot," imprisoned Prince Ban. Prince Ban believed he was very loyal to the government at the time and never dreamed that misfortune would befall him. He suffered this injustice for no reason and soon died of anger. Miss Li Jie, who is marrying the Tianshan Mongol prince this time, is the only beloved daughter left by Prince Ban. Prince Ban had three wives. The first and second wives did not have any children. Li Jie was born to Prince Ban's third wife, Ban Leqi. After Prince Ban's death, Ban Leqi remarried to an ordinary Mongol commoner. She is now only in her thirties. Thus, Li Jie, orphaned and alone, was raised by Prince Dawa, who inherited Prince Ban's position, herding sheep on the grasslands along the shores of Bosten Lake, like a very ordinary shepherdess. She was born very intelligent, knows graceful Mongol songs and dances, can play the Mongol ancient instrument "Tuokexiwote," and also studied in Mongol schools for a few days. Originally, she was betrothed to the son of Deputy Director Tao (Mongol ethnicity) of the former Heshuk Police Bureau. However, last year, after Man Guangqi, the son of Prince Man Han, inherited his father's position and became Prince Gong Han, his birth mother, Niao Jingbin, felt that her son had grown up and could establish a career and family at the same time. At this time, the leaders of the Heshuote and Hejing tribes proposed a marriage alliance. It is said that one day on the grasslands along the shores of Bosten Lake, many Mongol girls were gathered for Prince Gong Han to choose from. Among the girls, needless to say, Li Jie naturally became Prince Gong Han's only favorite, because Li Jie was not only very intelligent but also very beautiful, and her charming and affectionate eyes, her egg-shaped face, at first glance, looked very much like her mother. Her height was neither tall nor short. Her dignified, gentle, and full figure revealed the charm of a young girl. She was born at å·³ hour on the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth month of the twenty-third year (of the Republic), and is only fifteen years old now, the perfect age of a young maiden, no wonder Prince Gong Han fell in love with her at first sight. After this fairytale-like beautiful day, the leaders of the two tribes formally proposed marriage, and Li Jie and the young Mongol prince officially became engaged on January 6th of this year.

A tender spring melody blew on the shore of the lake, and from then on, Li Jie no longer felt lonely. With the arrival of spring, the spring breeze rippled the clear lake water, seemingly warming Li Jie's heart even more. In the flying days as the wedding day approached, the marching melody of "Give Me Muna" became more and more vigorous and tense.

Eve of the Wedding

On the day before the wedding, the groom, Prince Gong Han, rode a very extraordinary Yanqi horse to the bride's house to greet the bride. The horse's age and the age of the horse handler were carefully calculated, and the horse's saddle and body were also decorated very luxuriously. It is said that at dawn on the 25th, everyone in the yurts on Heshuk Beach was already drunk and sad. At the moment before Li Jie left Heshuk Beach, all the men, women, and children of the entire tribe really shed tears. Li Jie's relatives dragged her, unwilling to let her go. Finally, she was forcibly dragged onto the bridal sedan chair, which was carried by two white horses. At this time, the three to several hundred horsemen welcoming the bride surrounded the bride and galloped triumphantly, shouting all the way. From Heshuk to Hejing, there were about a hundred kilometers. They arrived at the prince's mansion at four o'clock in the afternoon. Earlier that day, at eleven fifteen in the morning, Prince Gong Han returned, surrounded by dozens of horsemen shouting. Prince Gong Han wore a top hat, a long gown, and a mandarin jacket, appearing cultured and refined, and not like a young hero of the grasslands. But when he took the lead and entered the prince's mansion with high spirits and joy overflowing from his eyebrows, this Tianshan Mongol prince could still be said to be a handsome young man. On this day, Dao Jingbin, Xi Muzhen, and Niao Jingbin's daughter, Manlin, as well as all the Mongol women who usually had the most fashionable hairstyles and wore the most fashionable cheongsams, all reverted to their original appearance and dressed in the Mongol women's style. The bridal chamber yurt was decorated. The path that the bride would take after entering the door was also marked by lamas. Auspicious clouds were covered with red cloth strips. Everything was ready. Niao Jingbin was supposed to get on the sedan chair at å¯ hour and get off at æª hour, but the bride did not arrive until four o'clock in the afternoon. By that time, the entire city of Hejing had been hanging flags for a day. My brother Fanqun and I hurriedly jumped on our horses and ran to the streets. From the southern end of the street all the way to the prince's mansion, the crowds were so dense that no water could pass through. In addition to the horsemen welcoming and sending the bride, there were those watching on horseback, those climbing trees to watch, and those standing on the rooftops to watch. Everyone was competing to see this unprecedented spectacle in Hejing. It was indeed extremely lively. The sun was shining warmly. In an atmosphere of jubilation, the first to walk towards the prince's mansion was the military band, followed by the ceremonial guard holding flags and umbrellas, then the team of lamas chanting scriptures, and finally the bridal sedan chair surrounded by hundreds of people and horses. The people on horseback, both men and women, were drunk and swaying, and shouting and singing. In front of the bridal sedan chair was a red cloth happy tent as large as a square zhang, followed by the women sending the bride and two "Donggan" horse grooms calling out to carry the sedan chair. The procession almost filled the only main street of Hejing County. At this time, many poor people were pulling ropes in several places to block the way and ask for lucky money. Thus, banknotes flew around. Such chaos and noise lasted for more than half an hour before they reached the prince's mansion. We had already abandoned our horses and squeezed into the crowd. He was taking exciting shots, and I was searching for touching materials. By the time we squeezed into the prince's mansion, it was a complete mess. After many Mongol ceremonies were performed, the bride finally walked into that yurt, still covered by the red curtain. The bride had been waiting for a long time.

Give Me Muna

On both sides of the hall, two large yurts were set up. The one on the right was filled with Lamaist statues and was the place to perform the "Zhi Wo Muna" ceremony. The one on the left was the bridal chamber, with extremely luxurious furnishings and decorations! There were also two iron beds inside. The bride sat on the iron bed on the left, still covered by the red curtain. Above was an image of Guanyin. In the middle were "paozi" and dishes for the god's banquet. Incense was offered, kowtows were performed, and hymns were sung. Except for offering wine during the ceremony, the order of "Give Me Muna" was largely the same as the old-fashioned wedding etiquette of the Han people. In short, the yurt was filled with people. Until late at night, that bridal chamber was still noisy. Perhaps this was the Mongol's "making a fuss in the bridal chamber"!

On the morning of the 26th, Li Jie met her parents-in-law. In the yurt, she offered wine and rice to her parents-in-law, and then offered wine again. Each time wine was offered, everyone had to sing once. The hosts of both the bride's and groom's families also offered wine and rice to each other. After offering wine and rice, they solemnly entrusted the bride to Prince Man Han, Niao Jingbin, and Xi Muzhen. Finally, the bride's family said goodbye, and one by one, the men and women of the bride's family shed tears again. This ceremony lasted until one thirty in the afternoon. That afternoon, a curtain-cutting ceremony was also held, and the red happy curtain covering the bride was taken away. Inside the yurt, everyone was Mongol, performing Mongol ceremonies and speaking Mongol words. What did I understand? I only remembered one Mongol sentence that Prince Gong Han told me at the time: This is the Mongol's "Give Me Muna," what you call "marriage."

### Yugoslavia: An Appendix

â Translated by Zhen Jun

The rift between Tito and Stalin has now become even more pronounced. In Yugoslavia, the brutal killing of an officer who supports the Soviet Union is already a common occurrence. Tito is taking a resistant attitude towards the Soviet Union. He wants to eliminate the Soviet echoers in the country and seek ways to sanction the Soviet followers, so that everyone no longer cares about Stalin.

The shortcomings and stains of Yugoslavia under the Soviet system have been fully exposed, arousing the people's hatred for Moscow's Cold War offensive. This is obviously a swift and powerful final test between dictators.

Stalin is now becoming increasingly indifferent to the debates between the United States and the Western European alliance. His attention has turned to another aspect, because he is urgently patching up what may be the weakest link in the Soviet empire. This is Yugoslavia, located in the southwest underbelly of the Soviet Union, which Churchill called "the soft underbelly of Europe." When the Soviet Union finds that the loyalty of this link is indeed doubtful, they can take any means, direct the army to attack, or use the power of the air force to destroy Yugoslavia entirely.

Until today, Stalin's attempt to seize Yugoslavia

The effort to enter the Soviet system has been declared a failure. Obstruction and condemnation, as well as more than a month of public disclosure of secrets, have all been ineffective. Something close to a miracle has happened in the circle of communists, that is, the communist party on the European continent even attempts to launch an open attack.

And Tito's struggle for seats in the parliament has made him unable to gain a foothold in Yugoslavia, or forced him to issue an apology, or activities to disperse his support, have all failed.

The contest between dictators has already begun, and Stalin is obviously intolerant of rebellious and challenging actions. This is a blow to the strength of the Soviet Union, and this restless poison may also spread to other parts of the Eastern European bloc, giving Western European countries an opportunity to attack this unexpected weakness in the Soviet camp. However, Stalin will obviously maintain the racial harmony between the two countries, and at the same time take concerted action against Western Europe through voting. Then the Western European countries will be expelled from Belgrade, and then Stalin will easily turn around and deal with the rising Tito.

This is very important. Stalin's tentative action is to understand the opposing relationship between him and Tito, and what the actual internal situation of Yugoslavia today is like.

The center of all disputes will eventually come down to this question: Who is the master of YugoslaviaâStalin or Tito? This question has never become so serious and acute in other satellite countries of the Soviet Union, but in Yugoslavia, since the end of the war, this annoying question has been growing, and each continuation of the dispute shows that it should be attributed to Chairman Stalin wanting to entrap Tito.

As early as during the war, Tito committed a serious "mistake." He showed an unusually cold and unresponsive attitude to the advice and assistance of the designers sent by Moscow to assist him in drafting the Five-Year Plan. Tito's ideal was not only to draft this great plan, but also to inspire the enthusiasm of the entire people to participate in this nation-building movement. So Moscow warned that Tito's plan was too childish and the outline was not clear enough.

This is an insignificant plan. Finally, Moscow accused Tito of not establishing a labor-based society, but that was necessary. If the communists come forward to govern, then they can dedicate themselves to completing it. An agricultural society can gradually improve only under firm leadership.

Yugoslav farmers are still as far away from the Soviet collective farm system as before. The Kremlin's order is for Tito to liquidate the local tyrants and transfer all their land to state-owned farms, forcing all

Farmers cooperate and cultivate together. Intellectuals also have to leave Belgrade and go deep into the countryside, but he did not implement it in this way. On the contrary, Tito promised the farmers of Yugoslaviaâwho account for 80% of the country's populationâthat they can cultivate freely and individually, and at the same time adopt the means of manipulating crop prices to make their lives better than the living standards of industrial areas. Tito also risked promising the farmers of Yugoslavia that they will have the freedom of private livestock. These measures have made Stalin very annoyed and cannot be forgiven.

The Communist Party in Yugoslavia does not have the effectiveness of a lively movement. This may be one of the factors that makes Stalin unhappy. Tito insists that the party organization should maintain a democratic style, so that the boundaries of the party are not clear, and communists and non-communists can have close contact and live in harmony. Tito is willing to eliminate non-party members, but he has never put the Communist Party above the country first, or allowed all workers in the country to receive the most satisfactory remuneration. Party members oppose Tito's reckless style, despising their "great contribution" to the country and the times, which also surprised their friends in Moscow. (To be continued)

### Northwest Overview

â Translated by Yang Guangjie

The representative of the Hui people ruling the southwest is General Ma Bufang of Qinghai. The reporter once drove to Xining, 150 miles west of Lanzhou, and visited him in his Western-style residence. After we entered Qinghai, we saw that Qinghai was working hard to promote some public works. Saplings are planted everywhere (it is said that in five years, Qinghai will afforest 600,000 trees), highways have been built, irrigation plans are being drafted, measures to increase timber production have been implemented, public clinics have been set up in many places, and compulsory schools have also been established in various places, and its performance is better than other parts of China.

The reporter met General Ma Bufang at 7 o'clock in the morning. His sparse beard made him appear much taller than he actually was. He extremely hates communism.

In fact, the Hui Muslim army led by General Ma Bufang is willing to fight and fights well. The reporter once saw them training in Xining, which was indeed stricter than other Chinese troops. However, Ma only has 100,000 troops, and because the defense line is too long, stretching from Dihua to the front line of Shaanxi, the defense force is not very strong. Recently, during the Southwest Provincial Leaders Conference held in Lanzhou, Ma requested that troops be transferred from various provinces to supplement him. Ma's army has very few heavy weapons, and their weapons are not uniform due to supply difficulties. He also has no arsenal. Recently, General Chennault's civil aviation team opened the Dihua air route, and only then did they airlift 50 tons of US aid materials to him.

Another Muslim military leader is Ma Hongkui of Ningxia Province. Since the area he rules is closer to the Communist area, he is not as optimistic as Qinghai about resisting the Communist invasion.

500 miles away from Ningxia is Chongqing in Sichuan, the wartime capital of China. Mayor Yang Sen is a famous military strategist. He claims that the Chinese people are afraid of communism.

In Sichuan, the common people often need two to three days to carry rice from various villages to the Tielian office to pay their taxes. Not only do they have to pay for their own food on the road, but the staff of the Tielian office often refuse to accept their rice on the grounds that it is of poor quality. However, the rice that is paid is often taken by speculators and sold on the market. Rice prices fall during the harvest and rise when there is a shortage of food.

Regardless of the state of peace talks, there are many soldiers here. No matter when and where you are, you will encounter people in uniform. In Lanzhou, there are no checkpoints, so soldiers replace them to check your luggage. On the border between Qinghai and Gansu, they are also responsible for the inspection. In Chengdu, there are very few coolies to carry luggage for travelers, and soldiers have taken over this job. On the highways of Hanzhong, Xi'an, and Sichuan, military transportation is frequent. Since there are frequent bandit alerts near Kunming, a part of the army is being transferred to guard and protect it.

### Legal Q&A

Answered by Lawyer Tang Mingshi

[Question from Mr. Fu Daxing] A has no children, B has two sons, and C has four sons. When A was alive, he designated B's eldest son to be adopted. Later, because C's eldest son disputed the inheritance, he gave him six mu of private land. However, C's eldest son died unmarried, and A, seeing that C was poor, agreed to take it back after C's death. After C died, his second, third, and fourth sons also passed away one after another, leaving only the second and third daughters-in-law and two nieces. With the public discussion of relatives, the land was provided for the two daughters-in-law to maintain their livelihoods. Now C's third daughter-in-law intends to adopt a son from another family, and C's second daughter-in-law intends to take in a son-in-law. Please advise (1) After the deaths of C's second and third daughters-in-law, can A's heirs take back the land that was given, or can it be taken back without waiting for the deaths of the two daughters-in-law? (2) Is there a statute of limitations for this type of event?

[Answer] According to the situation described in your question, the six mu of land seems to be a gift, and no conditions for recovery were attached. Moreover, the inheritance has been going on for a long time, so I am afraid it cannot be recovered.

[Question from Mr. He Guoxiong] (1) After I got engaged to Miss Wang, a relationship has occurred. If she becomes pregnant in the future, and is known by the girl's family, If the family takes me to court, am I criminally liable in law? (2) If the girl's family wants to declare a cancellation of the engagement, but both parties are unwilling, is the cancellation legally valid?

[Answer] (1) Since you know that there is criminal liability under the law, you should marry Miss Wang as soon as possible. It is believed that Miss Wang's family will not refuse, as both parties are already engaged. If her family asks for a delay, Miss Wang can explain the situation tactfully, and it is believed that they will not insist. (2) The engagement is determined by the wishes of the parties involved. Moreover, under these circumstances, the girl's family is unlikely to insist on canceling the engagement.
