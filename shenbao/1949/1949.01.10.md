[Our Beiping Dispatch, 9th] The decisive battle of the main forces in the North China theater is gradually unfolding.

Afterwards, they will concentrate on attacking Beiping. It is reported that the communist forces of Lin Biao's units have already gathered eight columns near the suburbs of Tianjin.

Since there was no need to defend the position any longer, it was ordered to withdraw actively. Lin Biao's Seventh Column, after two days of fire and blood, suffered heavy losses and no longer had the ability to fight. Dongjuzi has now become a no-man's land. As of the evening of the 8th, the bandits were reorganizing and awaiting reinforcements in Limingzhuang and Chenglinzhuang, under close surveillance by our army. The bandits attacking Fanjiabao from Zhao Gu Li Zhuang were the Twenty-second Division of the Eighth Column, which launched a fierce attack on us with the entire division, blindly firing over thirty mountain guns and field guns, but were all repelled by us.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] Du Yuming's troops, who have been confronting Chen Yi in the Xiaoyong area, Chenguanzhuang, and Qinglongji for 34 days, began a fierce battle with the Chen communist forces at 4:00 AM on the 6th. For the past 34 days, the Chen communist forces have used fierce attacks, followed by encirclement and psychological warfare tactics with loudspeakers. Finally, they mobilized their First, Second, Third, Fourth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, and Bohai Columns, which had been rapidly replenished after the Nianzhuang battle, as well as three independent brigades, and launched a fierce attack before dawn on the 6th on the 100 square kilometers of wilderness held by Du Yuming's troops. This attack began with a fierce bombardment. General Du Yuming immediately commanded the entire army to return fire with heavy artillery and sent a telegram requesting air force assistance. In order to "eat up" this large National Army force, Chen Yi's communist troops had to risk being bombed and strafed by planes gathering around the periphery of the encirclement in order to achieve their goal. In total, in the four days since, more than 50,000 soldiers have been killed or wounded, with the National Army suffering casualties from concentrated artillery fire from the communist troops, and the communist troops suffering casualties from the National Army's artillery fire and air strikes. On the night of the 8th, in order to assist Du's troops, the Air Force dispatched multiple C-47 aircraft to drop bombs on the south, west, and north sides of Zhouji, where the communist attacks were most intense. At dawn on the 9th, multiple Shenying aircraft, under the command of Deputy Commander Wang Shuming, were dispatched in batches to the battlefield to carry out destructive bombing. In particular, B-24 aircraft dropped bombs on Zengzhuang, Weizhuang, Wangzhuang, Zhouguanzhuang, Qinshuangcun, Xiaoshizhuang, Zhangjiazhuang, and Jihutong, the bandit strongholds surrounding Du's troops, inflicting heavy damage on the bandits. The Wangzhuang communist artillery position was destroyed, and the bandits in each stronghold suffered approximately 500 or more casualties each. At approximately 8:00 AM on the 9th, Deputy Commander Wang Shuming personally flew a B-24 aircraft to the battlefield to command and supervise the battle. The pilots of each fighter plane, under his command, became even more courageous and fierce, searching for and bombing and strafing the communist troops hiding in the trenches. By the afternoon, Du's troops had completely occupied Liuji. It is reported that this fierce battle is developing towards its climax. Liu communist forces' three columns in Guzhen, northern Anhui, and Chen communist forces' Seventh Column are rushing to the Chenguanzhuang Du's troops' area to support the communist forces. Although some National Army positions, such as Lulou, have been lost, Du's troops are still maintaining their calm fighting spirit of more than ten years, persisting in bloody struggle, hoping to achieve the goal of consuming more of the communist troops' strength. The scale of this battle is larger than Nianzhuang and Shuangduiji, and it is certain that it will yield greater results than Nianzhuang and Shuangduiji.

### Du Yuming Did Not Leave His Troops; Shushicun Flew Out of the Battlefield

His Chief of Staff, Shushicun, flew out on two PT-17 aircraft with Dong Mingde, Deputy Director of the Air Force Operations Department, on December 29th.

Everyone is still awaiting the official reply from the Chinese Communist Party regarding the peace issue, and how the four governments will consider this invitation is attracting much attention. It is reported that although Soviet Ambassador General Luo Shen has been slightly ill recently, he is still very concerned about the situation in our country. He did send embassy officials to contact our government on the 8th and accepted the diplomatic documents submitted by our side. A well-informed source revealed that the government's important action may have been decided after obtaining understanding from a certain friendly nation. If so, this should be the fruitful result of Zhang Zhizhong's continuous efforts in recent days.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 9th] Wu Tiecheng, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs, visited President Sun Ke and President Chiang this morning to report on the results of his discussions with the ambassadors of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France regarding the possibility of the three major powers assisting in the mediation of the civil war.

Sources familiar with the matter said: Wu did not directly request mediation during the talks on the 8th but only inquired about the attitudes of the three ambassadors regarding their respective governments' new policies on peace in China and the possibility of their assisting in this effort. The source said: If the replies of the three major powers are sympathetic and beneficial to the government, a direct request for mediation will be made. He said: Wu did not meet with the Soviet ambassador because he wanted to first inquire about the attitudes of countries that are generally considered friendly.

[United Press, Nanjing, 9th] Unofficial sources said on the 9th that Foreign Minister Wu Tiecheng had requested the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union to consider the situation in China and mediate for peace when he met with the ambassadors of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France yesterday. French Ambassador Meyrier has forwarded this matter to Soviet Ambassador Luo Shen, who is currently recuperating at his official residence.

[United Press, Nanjing, 9th] Well-informed sources said on the 9th that Shao Lizi predicted that there will be "important developments" in the political situation this spring.

### Zuo Shunsheng Tells His Staff That the Prospects for Peace Are Promising

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 9th] The Times Agency reports: It is said that Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zuo Shunsheng recently told his staff that the government's opening the door to peace this time means that the prospects for peace are very promising because the current government, unwilling to see the devastation of lives, is mostly in favor of peace. On the other hand, the Communist Party is unable to continue fighting for the following reasons: (1) Soviet leader Stalin is a firm and steady politician. Although the current Chinese Communist Army has the strength to cross the Yangtze River and defeat the government, he must consider international reactions. The United States is currently preparing to arm Japan and consolidate its defenses in the Pacific, which is unfavorable to the Soviet Union. (2) If the Chinese Communist Party can quickly control China, it is questionable whether it can truly be controlled by the Soviet Union when it becomes fully developed in the future. Due to the above factors, the Soviet Union may advocate reconciliation. (3) The Soviet Union has already controlled North Korea and the entire Northeast and most of North China and Central China in East Asia. This vast territory is sufficient to cope with incidents in East Asia. It is necessary to organize a coalition government and engage in rear-area consolidation and deployment, and then gradually annex. (4) The United States is willing to see the early establishment of a coalition government in order to implement the Marshall Plan to avoid the rapid deterioration of the world situation. (5) The members of the Democratic League need to obtain official positions and are very willing for peace to succeed early in order to advance. This time, they will definitely try their best to win over. Combining all the above factors, the prospects for peace are very promising.

Article 31: If the unit to which the recruited team member from the township (town) (district) is assigned proves that the recruit has not deserted at all within one year, the recruitment quota for the township (town) (district) shall be reduced by at least 50% for the second half of the year. If the desertion rate is within 20%, the quota shall be reduced by 20%. If the desertion rate is within 50%, the quota shall be reduced by 10%.

At the same time, the unit shall be responsible for arresting the deserters. If the deserters are not arrested, the military (directly subordinate regiment) divisional districts shall be notified and handled in accordance with the provisions of Articles 29 and 30. (2) Each unit shall assess and punish officers at each level based on the desertion rate reported by the officers at each level. Those who conceal the facts shall be severely punished after verification. If the desertion is not due to poor management or care, the punishment may be reduced or waived. If the deserter is arrested, the number of arrested deserters may offset the punishment to be received. (3) In transportation hubs and the rear areas of battlefields, the highest local military affairs agencies shall be responsible for ordering the security agencies or units to investigate and arrest deserters and stragglers. Anyone without military identification, or who has military identification but has left the unit, shall be arrested and handed over to the legal district or designated reception agency for guidance. After guidance, they shall be sent back to the unit for service. Those who refuse to return to the unit after guidance shall be punished in accordance with the Army, Navy, and Air Force Criminal Law.

The recruit shall be retired immediately upon arrival.

Article 34: Soldiers with combat merit and disabled soldiers may retire according to regulations after approval.

Recent Developments in the Palestinian Situation Washington Expresses Grave Concern United States and Soviet Union Investigate Truth of Downed British Plane

[United Press Washington 8th] U.S. officials today are greatly concerned about the British plane shot down by Israeli forces in Palestine but hope that after all parties generally accept the UN ceasefire order, no more serious disputes will occur between Britain and Israel. The initial official reaction believes that this matter will inevitably anger the British government and cause a new anti-Semitic wave among the British people, but it will not lead to war.

[United Press, Tel Aviv, 9th] Israeli officials said on the 9th that the Israeli government will protest to the United Nations the "undeniable hostile act" of Britain sending armed fighter planes to fly over Israeli airspace. They said that the British troops and equipment heading to Aqaba, which is adjacent to southern Palestine, are "very serious," and questioned whether Britain currently considers itself a belligerent. Details of the British-Israeli air battle were released on the 8th, and Israeli Prime Minister Gurion and Foreign Minister Shetok were not in Tel Aviv, but the two are studying reports from the UN observers who were captured, the two British pilots, and other aspects before submitting formal final documents to the UN and the US State Department. Israeli officials insisted that all five British planes were shot down by Jewish ground and air forces over Israeli territory and the Egyptian-Israeli border, and repeatedly denied the British claim that the air battle took place in Egyptian airspace. U.S. Representative McDonald and Soviet Ambassador Yetiv went to HaKiyah, near Tel Aviv, where the Israeli government is located, to inquire about the details of the British plane being shot down. The two are also expected to meet with Shetok on the 9th, and McDonald will also discuss with the U.S. military attaché. Captured British pilot McErhow has been escorted to Tel Aviv by senior Israeli intelligence personnel for questioning.

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 9th] To date, details of the situation in the Negeb are unknown. It is reported that the British Air Force has dispatched bombing raids on Israeli concentrations and columns.

Internationalized Holy Land Dispute Changes Nature Czech Republic Says Britain Should Bear Responsibility for Arab-Jewish War

[Agence France-Presse Paris 8th] Well-informed sources here said today that the Palestine dispute has completely changed its nature in recent days, with four key elements: (1) Egypt agreed to open ceasefire talks with Israel, (2) the British Foreign Office criticized Israel, saying that Israeli troops are currently fighting with Arab troops with Russian assistance, (3) Transjordan invoked the 1948 treaty between Britain and Transjordan and requested British assistance, (4) Rida has established a new government in Iraq, led by Said, who is working hard to support the partial merger of Iraqi, Syrian, and Palestinian Arabs under King Abdullah of Transjordan. This merger must be achieved after a peaceful settlement is reached with Palestinian Jews.

The same source also pointed out that the plan is to cede the Negeb to Transjordan, as Transjordan is currently very pro-British and is valued by Britain because if Britain is forced to completely withdraw from the Egyptian Canal Zone, it can use Transjordan as its military base. Therefore, yesterday's unfortunate incident in the skies near the Negeb may be a prelude to a strong intervention by Britain. The entire Palestinian issue now seems to be becoming the Negeb issue, but in today's situation, it has gone beyond the scope of just a Jewish-Arab dispute.

[Agence France-Presse London 8th] British officials emphasized today that the purpose of sending a British force to Aqaba is for precautionary reasons and is entirely based on the treaty between Britain and Transjordan. While a Foreign Office spokesman declined to release the strength of the British troops sent to Aqaba, it is understood that the presence of the British Royal Air Force in Amman and Mafraq is in accordance with the treaty. The spokesman also said that Israeli troops are still stationed in Egyptian territory, about three miles south of Rafa. Israel's victories are largely due to Czech assistance with planes, arms, and ammunition, while the supply of arms to the Arabs is prohibited.

[United Press, Prague, 9th] The Czech Republic said on the 9th that the Palestinian war continues purely because "Britain is pulling the trigger for the Arabs." The Prague newspaper "People's News" published an editorial titled "Thief Crying 'Stop Thief'" stating, "If it were not for Britain's imperialist policies, there would be no more bloodshed in Palestine, and the Arab and Jewish peoples could live together peacefully." It also said, "Britain should also bear half the responsibility for the Dutch invasion of Indonesia and the violation of the UN Charter. Britain does not blame itself for this, but instead blames others. On the contrary, Britain is the main culprit for the violation of UN principles and resolutions in Palestine." Britain accused the Czech Republic last week of privately shipping arms to support Israel. "People's News" launched a counterattack.

Fighting Resumes in Negeb Area Loud Explosions Heard in the Holy Land

[Agence France-Presse, Cairo, 8th] After less than an hour of calm, fighting resumed in the Negeb area today. The Egyptian side said that this was caused by Israeli troops firing on Egyptian positions. Arab League Secretary General Azzam announced today that Egypt has not requested foreign military assistance, nor has it considered requesting Britain to implement its treaty obligations, as Egypt believes that the treaty has expired. Azzam expressed regret for the cautious attitude taken by some Arab politicians regarding the changing situation in Palestine and said that it is overly optimistic to believe that the Jews will earnestly comply with the new ceasefire order.

[Agence France-Presse, Jerusalem, 9th] Loud explosions were heard in the eastern district of the Holy City on the evening of the 8th. Reliable military sources indicate that this was an accidental event, but the authorities refused to comment on the matter.

Affected by War, China's Tea Exports to Africa Shift to Japan

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 9th] After the end of the war, Japan's green tea exports, which have often been overshadowed by cheap and high-quality Chinese tea, have recently improved unexpectedly. African tea importers, due to the war in China, have been unable to purchase tea from China and have come to Japan to purchase it. The first batch of 1.5 million units of Japanese green tea for export to Africa this year has already been shipped this week.

Indonesia Determined to Fight for Independence Siam Formally Refuses to Attend New Delhi Conference

[United Press, Karachi, 8th] Indonesian representative to the United Nations Sumitro said on the 8th that the Republic of Indonesia will continue to use guerrilla tactics and scorched earth policies in its "war" for independence. Sumitro told reporters that the only key to resolving the Indonesian issue is "the determination of the Republican government, the restoration of Republican territory, the withdrawal of Dutch troops, and free general elections."

He said, "Although we are grateful to the United States for being prepared to assist in any appropriate way for Dutch-Indonesian cooperation at any time, I cannot agree with the United States' view that the fears of the Republican leaders may be alleviated due to the Dutch guarantee." He continued, "The United States and other powers should now bear the major responsibility for the events that have occurred in Asia."

[United Press, New Delhi, 9th] A Foreign Ministry spokesman announced today that a conference of Asian and Near Eastern countries initiated by Indian Prime Minister Nehru will be held on the 20th of this month to discuss the Indonesian issue. The conference will last for three days, during which countries will exchange views on steps to deal with Dutch actions in Indonesia.

[United Press, London, 9th] Indonesian President Sukarno and other Indonesian leaders are expected to attend the New Delhi conference after being released by the Dutch authorities.

[United Press, Bangkok, 8th] According to reliable sources, Siam sent a memorandum to the Indian ambassador refusing India's invitation to attend the New Delhi conference, stating that the Siamese government is waiting for "the results of the Security Council's further efforts to deal with the Indonesian issue."

British and Siamese Joint Communist Suppression Sides Reach Agreement

[Agence France-Presse, Bangkok, 9th] The delegations from Britain and Siam attending the Songkhla military conference have reached an agreement on the joint efforts of the two countries' land, air, and police forces on both sides of the Malaysian and Siamese borders to suppress the Communist guerrilla teams lurking in the forests. The final communiqué issued by the Siamese delegation in Songkhla stated that the British-Siamese conference in Songkhla made very satisfactory progress. The British representatives attending this time included General Butcher and Colonel Gray, an important leader in the police force. Gray is an expert in guerrilla warfare and has gained considerable experience in fighting offensive teams in Palestine.

Senate Must Fully Investigate Before Approving Acheson's Nomination Leading Republican Senators Make Request

[United Press, Washington, 8th] Senators Vandenberg and other leading Republican senators on the 8th requested that the Senate conduct a full investigation before approving Acheson's nomination as Secretary of State. Republican senators want to understand Acheson's attitude towards the Soviet Union, the conflict between East and West, and State Department officials accused of being unsafe. Acheson may also need to disclose his law firm's relationship with the Polish Communist government, as well as his personal relationship with Hiss, who has been accused of being a communist.

Acheson's appointment as Secretary of State has sparked speculation in diplomatic circles that President Truman may have decided to take on a more important role in foreign policy. Friends of Truman and Acheson insist that this appointment does not mean taking a softer stance towards the Soviet Union. Acheson was one of the first to advocate "taking a firm and patient stance towards the Soviet Union." Vandenberg, now the main spokesman for Republican foreign policy, called Acheson Truman's "personal choice." Vandenberg also said that the appointment was not discussed with leaders of both parties in Congress on foreign policy beforehand.

Symington Strenuously Advocates U.S. Building Large Air Force Army Enlistment Reaches Full Quota

[United Press, Washington, 8th] Air Force Secretary Symington reiterated today that the United States will build a 70-wing Air Force, regardless of the huge expenditures. The 70-wing Air Force is a feature of the four-year plan, which aims to make the Air Force capable of coping with any event by 1952.

[United Press, Washington, 8th] The U.S. Army's voluntary enlistment and re-enlistment rate averages 35,000 per month. Due to this high rate, Army officials announced that they will suspend conscription in January and February. Army Secretary Royal said, "Conscription will be suspended when voluntary enlistment and re-enlistment are sufficient to maintain the strength of the Army."

Hawaii Volcano Erupts Rock Followed by Earthquake and Heavy Rain

[United Press, Hilo, Hawaii, 8th] After the eruption of the Mauna Loa volcano on the island of Hawaii, a strong earthquake followed today.

Chinese Students in the U.S. Appeal to the United States Requesting Economic Assistance to Complete Their Studies

[Central News Agency, New York, 8th Special Dispatch] A special committee of the National Association of Foreign Student Advisors has issued an appeal to President Truman, members of Congress, and the State Department's Educational Exchange Advisory Committee, requesting $2.5 million in emergency economic assistance for 5,000 foreign students in the United States (including 2,900 Chinese students). The special committee pointed out in the letter that due to the lack of U.S. dollar foreign exchange by foreign governments and the rising cost of studying in the United States, at least 5,000 of the 25,000 foreign students in the United States will be unable to complete their studies, which can be completed in June of this year, and will be forced to return home. The special committee also suggested that the State Department should amend the immigration rules for foreign students so that they can continue to study in the United States in the current emergency situation. The special committee of the National Association of Foreign Student Advisors is organized by organizations such as the China Institute in America and the Foreign Student Fellowship Committee. The above action by the special committee is the greatest effort made by the American educational community to assist foreign students studying in the United States, especially the 2,500 Chinese students whose finances have been interrupted.

New Zealand Prime Minister Delivers Speech Emphasizing Importance of Pacific Alliance

[United Press, Ottawa, 9th] New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser revealed on the 9th that the Pacific Defense Alliance may have been discussed when the Federal Prime Minister met last fall. Fraser told reporters that the Pacific Alliance is a "very important issue," and he personally believes that Canada, the United States, and Latin American countries should participate if this agreement is reached. Fraser declined to explicitly state that the Pacific Pact will be concluded and declined to further explain his views. He said that this is not an urgent need, but "if a crisis does exist, then certain agreements must be reached." Fraser pointed out that Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson had said last year that the Commonwealth countries had paid attention to this agreement. He said, "But there is no official talk about this." But he continued, "All countries along the Pacific coast should participate."

Misunderstanding of Allied Policy Towards Japan MacArthur Sends Telegram to Clarify States U.S. Magazine Article Completely Untrue

[United Press, New York, 8th] This issue of "The New Leader" magazine published an article by former New York Times diplomatic reporter Apon, which stated that MacArthur's indulgence of Japanese communism has caused misunderstandings among Americans. MacArthur personally telegraphed the magazine's editor, Kolsky, today to correct the record, stating that all the points in the article are completely untrue and are purely false propaganda, identical to the tactics used by Moscow. Furthermore, Apon has not been to Japan since the war and is unfamiliar with the situation in Japan. Apon's article stated that MacArthur has a false sense of security about the crisis in the Far East. The Communist Party has infiltrated Japanese labor unions, and the Soviet Union has used the coercive and undemocratic methods of MacArthur's headquarters as propaganda tools. The Communist Party's power is extremely strong, and once the United States goes to war with the Soviet Union, conspiracy sabotage and internal unrest will further weaken the already shaky position of the United States. MacArthur's headquarters after the war did not make Japan self-sufficient, and the Japanese people only maintain a meager ration for survival. Most senior members of the occupation forces believe that Japan may turn anti-American and pro-Soviet. MacArthur is unaware of this and mistakenly believes that the Communist Party has no chance of rising. In fact, news censorship is strict in Japan, and Americans have no way of knowing the truth. MacArthur is personally responsible for this situation.

Yesterday Was Sunday, Business as Usual for Deposit and Exchange The Balancing Fee Was Raised Again by a Thousand Yuan The First Batch of Applicants Will Be Notified of Gold and Silver Collection Procedures in One Week

[Our Newspaper Report] Yesterday was a regular Sunday, but the Central Bank authorities decided to conduct gold and silver deposit and exchange business as usual at around 9 p.m. on the 8th, and temporarily notified all banks and treasuries to follow suit. However, the gold balancing fee was raised by another thousand yuan on the 8th. Depositors and exchangers of gold must pay a total of 9,000 yuan, including an exchange rate of 1,000 yuan, a deposit of 1,000 yuan, and a balancing fee of 7,000 yuan. Depositors and exchangers of silver dollars must pay a total of 90 yuan per yuan, including an exchange rate of 10 yuan, a deposit of 10 yuan, and a balancing fee of 70 yuan. The National Bank made the decision hastily, and even the news media were not widely notified, so fewer people knew about it. In addition, due to the holidays for the silver and money industry on Sundays, the supply of cash was also less, and the lines of people queuing up to collect application forms in front of the banks and treasuries were not as crowded as the previous two days. As a result, the National Bank issued 400 application forms, China 200, Communications 100, China Trust Bureau 50, the number for the Cooperative Treasury is unknown, and the Postal Remittance Bureau temporarily suspended issuing them for one day because colleagues were scattered everywhere and could not be notified in time. It is understood that in the future, each bank and treasury will continue to issue application forms as usual every Sunday, and Wednesday may still be the holiday for deposit and exchange work. A final decision can be made this Wednesday. In addition, according to regulations, those who applied for deposit and exchange of gold and silver and paid cash in the first batch (i.e., the 5th) will be notified of the procedures for collecting gold and silver in one week, so it is expected that the Central Bank will announce the gold collection procedures around the 12th or 13th.

Shipping Industry Has Difficulty Maintaining Operations Petitions the Executive Yuan for a Loan of 200 Million Determined to Send Representatives to Petition in Beijing Tomorrow

The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, due to the extreme difficulty of shipping operations and the approaching Lunar New Year, when funds are not easy to turn around, yesterday submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance and Communications, requesting a loan of 200 million gold yuan from the National Bank to maintain operations. According to the person in charge of the association, the reasons for the difficulty in the shipping industry are: (1) Frequent military transportation, most ships are requisitioned, and the rent for requisitioned ships is extremely low, accounting for only one-thirtieth of the operating costs. The requisitioned fees are owed for one or two months, and when the payment is made, the value of the currency has depreciated several times. Furthermore, the loading of goods is slow, delaying the schedule and causing huge losses, so each time a ship is requisitioned, it is almost equivalent to no income and a complete loss. (2) During the evacuation period, each ship evacuated public educators and transported public property, and the return journey was mostly empty, resulting in huge losses. (3) Coal prices, oil prices, foreign exchange rates, and various commodity prices are constantly adjusted and fluctuating. Although shipping prices have been adjusted, they are often out of sync and lagging behind, resulting in significant losses. During the price limit period, the losses are even greater. (4) Insufficient allocation of coal and oil, which must be supplemented by the black market. The difference between the official price and the black market price is also a significant burden on the shipping companies. (5) Slack cargo transportation, large expenses, and no way to cut back, while freight income must be collected after transportation and is often delayed, while any expenses of the shipping company must be paid in cash. The depreciation of the currency and the interest burden all affect the turnover of funds, and the year-end payment of double pay is even more difficult. Due to the above factors, each shipping company is overwhelmed when it comes to purchasing fuel, materials, and paying salaries. It is estimated that each shipping company needs 420 million gold yuan for necessary expenses such as purchasing fuel, rice, and paying salaries during the Lunar New Year, and the cost of purchasing hardware, materials, insurance, and ship repairs has not yet been calculated. It is planned that each company will raise 220 million yuan, and the remaining 200 million yuan will be requested from the government to be loaned by the National Bank. It has been decided to send representatives such as Wei Wenhan, Li Yunliang, Zhong Shandao, and Shen Qi to Beijing tomorrow to petition.

Shipping Federation Sends Telegram Calling for Peace

The National Shipping Industry Federation yesterday sent a telegram calling for peace. The original telegram reads: "To President Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, Mr. Mao Zedong in Yan'an, all national organizations, and all newspapers: Our people have long suffered from the bitterness of war. The same country, the same nation, the same writing. Even if there are different political beliefs, they can be resolved through consultation and negotiation. There is no need to resort to arms, causing the people to suffer the tragic fate of broken limbs, destroyed property, and broken families. Now that the President has a New Year's Day peace message, and Mr. Mao has always emphasized peace and is willing to cooperate with various parties, now is the time to turn hostility into friendship. We implore both sides to issue a ceasefire order immediately, designate a location, and reopen peace talks. This great act of turning the tide will be a blessing in history and a light in public opinion, preserving the complete mountains and rivers, spending a peaceful period, laying the foundation for construction, and nourishing the broken vitality. It only takes a change of heart from you all to realize this. You all value democracy, and public opinion tends towards peace. We implore you to accept it generously and approach it with calmness and tolerance. In the past, the martyrs of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom had a poem that said: 'My ambitions have not been fulfilled, and the people are suffering. There are tears everywhere in the southeast.' Please allow us to recite it for you. We are all countrymen, victory is not martial, and concession is not humiliation. The rights and wrongs of a hundred generations will depend on whether or not we can make concessions today. We are writing this telegram with trepidation, and we implore you to consider it. Du Tang, Chairman of the National Shipping Industry Federation, and the shipping industry associations of Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Datong, Jiujiang, Hankou, Yichang, Shashi, Wanxian, Chongqing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Zhenhai, Yin County, Yongjia, Fuzhou, Xiamen, Keelung, Shantou, Guangzhou, Shanghai Inland River, Changshu, Wu County, Wuxi, Bengbu, Nanchang, Changsha, Xiangtan, Wuzhou, Yongning, Ruian, Wuxing, Jiangyin, Liujiang, Linsen, and Wujin respectfully bow."

### Preliminary Ideas on China's New Economic Policy

— Shou Miancheng

Whether international or domestic wars, their direct causes, though complex and varied, all have their root causes in economics. The rebellion of the Chinese Communist Party, its superficial motive being to seize power, is still calling for economic reform; and its ability to sustain itself to this day also lies in economics. Therefore, the Chinese government should thoroughly reform the economy in order to achieve success in suppressing the rebellion and victory in peace. Otherwise, war is war, and people's livelihood is people's livelihood. If there is no certainty of victory in war, even victory is difficult to sustain. Therefore, I have drafted an outline of China's new economic policy to suggest to the authorities and to seek guidance from enlightened people.

First, China's new economic policy should take rationalization as the highest principle: China should determine its rational economic policy based on national conditions and with reference to the advantages of the economic policies of various countries. Capitalism, starting from individualism and self-interest competition, has great drawbacks and is not sufficient to be a model, but its successes can also be referenced. Communism, starting from collectivism, public ownership, and public operation, obliterates individuality and binds freedom, which is not very reasonable, but it is not without its advantages that can be adopted. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood originally sought to adopt the strengths of various systems and eliminate their weaknesses, but the methods were not very detailed, and due to factual changes, it is necessary to make appropriate revisions or supplements to fully meet the requirements of time and space.

If we want to seek the rationality of economic policy, in terms of space, it must be able to meet the different needs of various regions of the country. The situation in various parts of China is very different, and the cultural standards are different by several centuries. Therefore, the elasticity and adaptability of the economic system are extremely important. In terms of time, it must be able to gradually evolve and gradually improve. It cannot reach a highly modern state overnight, nor can it adopt an immutable system. In terms of society, it must be able to conform to the requirements of all the people or the largest number of people, and the interests of a few people must never be taken as a prerequisite. In terms of steps, it is necessary to distinguish between priorities and urgency, grasp the center of gravity, and select the important and urgent ones for serious implementation first.

I believe that China's new economic policy should especially strengthen the development of cooperative organizations and cooperative undertakings. Cooperative undertakings are democratic and socialized economic organizations, which have the benefits of private property economy and communist economy without their drawbacks. They should also have elasticity to adapt to the needs and capabilities of different times and different spaces. It is the most rational economic system. If cooperative organizations are used in rural areas, they can strengthen farmers' organizations, solve the distribution of agricultural land, and develop the rural economy; if they are used in cities, they can also improve the status of workers, develop the industrial economy, strengthen consumer groups, and facilitate price control.

Second, China's new economic policy must be more fair and reasonable than communism and more economically effective than capitalism in order to be successful: The Chinese Communist Party's call for land revolution and the liquidation of local despots has made the wealthy fearful and evasive, while the extremely poor, though unaware of what communism is, often blindly follow it because they believe it will benefit them. In fact, there are not many people in China who truly understand the communist system, and there are even fewer who have the ability to implement it. The situation on the capitalist side is similar. They only know how to follow the example of Britain and the United States, thinking that as long as the government does not regulate private enterprises and allows them to develop freely, a capitalist system like that of Britain and the United States can be formed. In fact, there are probably not many capitalists in China today who truly have the ability to build a capitalist system. However, if we do not actively work to establish a new economic system that is more fair and reasonable than communism and more economically effective than capitalism, and only know how to passively oppose it, it will be difficult to achieve results and may even lead to the failure of military suppression of the rebellion.

Third, China's new economic policy must take planned control as the main method and should immediately formulate and implement a long-term plan: The government has previously formulated a five-year plan, but because various conditions were not met, it resulted in nothing. The first condition for planned construction is the spirit of creation. The government must have the creative spirit of destroying the old system and building a new system to achieve a certain ideal, and then planned construction can succeed. Secondly, planned construction also requires the condition of a scientific spirit. It must be very objective, very detached, very precise, very concrete, very realistic, and very able to grasp the key points so that the executors can truly implement it according to the plan and be effective. Planned construction also requires a spirit of practice. In other words, once there is a plan, it must be controlled and executed. If the plan does not match the facts, it must be revised at any time. After the revision, it must still be controlled and executed until the construction goal is achieved.

Fourth, the construction of each department and the implementation of planned control by governments at all levels must be closely connected and coordinated: I advocated above that implementing key plans and關統制can be illustrated with several examples. Increasing the production of grain and cotton can be implemented as a key plan. The construction of railways and waterways can also be implemented as a key plan. To implement these key plans, it is necessary to control their main key points. For example, seeds, fertilizers, water conservancy, and agricultural tools are the key to increasing grain and cotton production; steel, fuel, and wood are the key to railway and waterway construction. However, these key points must be coordinated by various departments and governments at all levels in order to complete the control according to the plan. For example, land system, price system, banking system, and education system are all closely related to these constructions. If they are disconnected from each other, there will be no planned construction, and even if construction is possible, there will be no work efficiency to speak of.

Fifth, to implement the new economic policy, it is necessary to adopt new economic education to change the general social concepts and atmosphere: At present, the general society mostly holds individualism, worship of money, selfishness, and endless competition. In this atmosphere, it is impossible to implement a rationalized new economy. Secondly, the disconnection between education and career is also a major defect. Those who study agriculture disdain to engage in agriculture, and those who study industry disdain to work in industry, and are only willing to be employees of institutions, which has completely lost the function of economic education. Therefore, China's education needs to be thoroughly reformed. In terms of spirit, we must earnestly cultivate the concept and habit of mutual assistance and cooperation among students at all levels, emphasizing public interests and downplaying private interests; in terms of skills, we must teach students the practical skills of farming and working, and all teaching materials must be suitable for China's actual needs. Western materials can only be used for reference and cannot be selected as teaching materials. Students studying abroad, except for a few students, should focus on field trips and submit field trip reports. In terms of responsibility, all graduates of practical subjects must engage in practical work and must not arbitrarily change careers or concentrate on taking public office in institutions.

Sixth, to implement the new economic policy, it is necessary to mobilize social forces to cooperate with the government to promote it: The implementation of the new economic policy is related to every department of people's lives and every corner of the country, and it must have places where it conflicts with the interests of feudal forces. Therefore, it is difficult to thoroughly implement or fully promote it by relying solely on government laws and regulations. Under a one-party dictatorship, the organization of the party can still be used; under a multi-party political situation, perhaps the destruction of the opposition party is necessary. Therefore, mobilizing social forces to jointly promote it is an indispensable condition. This kind of work of launching and uniting social forces can be carried out in the form of a new economic policy promotion association.

Seventh, to implement the new economic policy, we should promote work competitions, technical guidance, and reward scientific inventions to increase economic efficiency: My country's technology is backward, and capital is lacking. To increase work efficiency, we must promote work competitions, technical guidance, and reward inventions. These tasks have been tried out by party and government agencies, but the results are poor. The problem seems to be that they have no real understanding of the work, and there is no concrete plan to match. For example, when I was in Chongqing, I remember that printing workers held a competition for typesetting speed. The speed of printing can be said to be irrelevant, but can holding a competition be said to be a matter of urgency? Technical guidance is relatively more recognized, but the scope is small and the benefits are very limited. In the past, awards for inventions were only given after the fact, and there was no active encouragement and cultivation beforehand. Moreover, invention cannot only rely on individual free activities, but must rely on the collective actions of institutions and groups. This is even more difficult to achieve, and is also its shortcoming.

Eighth, to implement the new economic policy, we must strictly reward and punish. Those who have contributed to promoting the new policy will be rewarded, and those who have committed crimes that hinder the new policy will be punished: There are many laws and regulations in our country for implementing the new policy, but they lack revolutionary provisions. However, even in terms of existing laws and regulations, many are regarded as empty words and have little effect. The lack of clarity in the reward and punishment methods themselves is one of the reasons, and the failure to seriously implement the rewards and punishments is an important reason. Our society rarely encourages those who work hard, and even deliberately destroys them because of excluding dissidents, which is even more counterproductive. (Specific methods omitted)

The eight principles described above are all aimed at ensuring that everyone has a life and that everyone's life can be gradually improved. China has a large land and a lot of labor, and China's materials are also needed by foreign countries, and can be used to exchange for foreign machinery and technology. The only things that can hinder us from implementing the new economy to improve everyone's life are the destruction of war, the laziness and selfishness of the people, and the lack of revolutionary decision-making and revolutionary ability of the country. If China wants to survive in the present world, and wants everyone to enjoy the benefits that mankind has, then it must seek the direction of our country's new economic system on the road to rationalization and socialization, which is undeniable.

### Wartime Wives Enter in Large Numbers; Overseas Chinese in the United States Set a New Production Record in a Century

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 8th] A Chinese-run English newspaper here reports:

The production rate of overseas Chinese in 1948 set the highest record in a century. There were 763 births in Chinese hospitals alone, including 390 males and 373 females. Since Chinese hospitals usually only handle 60% of the Chinese babies born here, there should be over 1,000 babies born in this situation. The newspaper said: The large number of wartime Chinese wives entering the country is one of the reasons for the surge in production. More than 1,000 people have entered the district. The number of people entering the country in the past two years is the largest number of Chinese women entering the country since 1880. The black market for gold and silver has rebounded.
