### Initial Conclusions Reached on Principles Discussion; Eight Conditions Modified; Yu Youren to Represent Government and Go to Beiping Tomorrow

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The formal peace talks conference has not yet begun on the 12th, but the exchange of conditions prior to the meeting and the discussion of principles based on the eight conditions of the Chinese Communists have yielded preliminary conclusions. Pre-meeting consultations have come to an end as of the 12th. According to what this reporter has learned from related sources, the Chinese Communists have made considerable revisions to their attitude towards the eight conditions. Furthermore, the government delegation's report on the preliminary consultations will be sent to Nanjing shortly, and an agreement can be decided upon for signing once the government has studied and agreed to it.

Acting President Li's representative Li Yuqing, Legislative Yuan members Wei Yongcheng, Qiu Changwei, Cheng Siyuan, and others were all present to see them off. Yu Youren was also present to see Fu Xuewen off. Zhu Yunshan was wearing a black Zhongshan suit, holding a black leather overcoat with a leather collar. He had a black mustache and looked quite old. His mysterious aura seemed to remain as he left Nanjing. After Zhu got out of the car, he was ushered into the airport by Shao, Cheng, and others. Liu Zhongrong, wearing a navy blue suit and a grass-green short jacket, boarded the plane first. After Shao's wife, Fu Xuewen, got out of the car, she exchanged pleasantries with this reporter. This reporter presented her with copies of the 12th editions of this newspaper and the News Daily. Mrs. Shao said, "Please write well about this. Mr. Shao asked me to go.

### Government to Establish Management Committee for North-South Navigation and Material Exchange; Measures to be Announced After Approval by the Executive Yuan; Executive Yuan to Discuss Proposed Postal, Telecommunications, and Railway Price Increases Today

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The Executive Yuan will submit the plans for North-South navigation and material exchange for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 13th. It will be announced and implemented as soon as it is approved. The plan has already been reviewed by Deputy Premier Jia, relevant heads of departments and commissions, and people in the navigation industry. The government will establish a management committee to guide navigation and material exchange affairs, and be responsible for management. Regarding the scope of material exchange, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has already drafted a list of materials that can be transported from the government area to the Communist area, including Taiwan sugar, gauze, grain, caustic soda, industrial raw materials, and machine parts. It is hoped to exchange for coal, soybeans, furs, pigs, etc. from the Communist area. In principle, goods will be exchanged for goods, with the types determined by the government and the quantities handled by the two parties themselves. Merchants must submit their applications to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review before departure, and ships must be reviewed by the Ministry of Transportation.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The Executive Yuan will discuss the postal, telecommunications, and railway price increases at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 13th. The price increase method proposed by the Ministry of Transportation is to increase postal, telecommunications, and railway prices by ten times, effective from the 16th of this month. The past Legislative Yuan passed a method for adjusting postal, telecommunications, and railway rates, stipulating that postal, telecommunications, and railway freight rates be adjusted once a month. The Ministry of Transportation believes that current price fluctuations are severe, and the price difference between the beginning and end of the month is significant. It decided to submit a proposal to the Executive Yuan on the 13th to change the adjustment to twice a month, and consult the Legislative Yuan to amend the original method. Minister of Transportation Duanmu Jie recently hosted all members of the Transportation Committee of the Legislative Yuan to explain that the transportation business cannot be maintained without price increases, which has been understood by the committee members. The Legislative Yuan has included the postal, telecommunications, and railway price increase proposal on the agenda for the Yuan meeting on the 15th.

### Communist Army in Jiangbei Continues Attacks; Fierce Assaults on Anqing Still Repelled by National Army; Garrison on Taiyang Island Northwest of Hugang Withdraws

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Although the CCP Central Committee has formally ordered a cessation of military offensives, as of noon on the 12th, several bridgeheads on the Jiangbei front were still under continuous attack by Communist artillery. Among them, the battles were fiercest in Anqing Yuxikou (across the river from Wuhu) and Taiyang Island in the Jiang River northwest of Huogang Town. On the Anqing front, starting on the night of the 11th, a division of the Communist army under Chen Geng continued to fiercely assault the agricultural school and Qipan Mountain northeast of the city. After being repelled before dawn on the 12th, they resumed shelling the National Army positions continuously from 9:00 AM. After the National Army launched a joint counterattack from the land, sea, and air, the fighting gradually subsided by noon. On the Yuxikou front, starting last night, two divisions of the Communist army under Chen Yi's 30th Army also launched a fierce assault, and were also repelled by noon on the 12th. On the Taiyang Island front, the 24th Army of Chen Yi's division, about one division strong, under the cover of artillery fire, forcibly crossed the river to Taiyang Island in the Jiang River from Liujia Ferry on the north bank at midnight on the 11th. A battalion of the National Army defending the island, due to the disparity in strength, actively withdrew by noon on the 12th after a fierce battle to strengthen the defenses on the south bank. Jiangpu City and Xiliang Mountain (across the river from Dangtu) were also attacked by the Communist army last night and this morning, and were all repelled by the National Army.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] According to a certain military observer: The reason why several bridgeheads on the Jiangbei front are still being attacked by the Communist army on the 12th is that the Communist army is attempting to capture as many of the more important National Army bridgehead positions north of the river as possible before receiving the order to cease offensives, so that they can launch a large-scale crossing of the river once the peace talks break down. Therefore, apart from the bridgeheads east of Huazikou (across the river from Qixia Mountain) to Bawu across the river from Jiangyin, where the Communist army has retreated slightly and the fighting has subsided, the fighting on the line from Jiangpu west to Anqing continues. Therefore, the widespread rumor that the Communist army in Jiangbei is retreating is obviously premature, and whether the Communist army is sincere in stopping military offensives should be clear by the evening of the 13th.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The National Army positions on the mountains about four or five li north of Pukou West Jiangpu City were attacked again by more than a thousand troops of Wu Huawen's Communist army last night. They were repelled by Liu Bingfang's troops of the National Army at around 4:00 AM on the 12th. In addition, at Huazikou on the opposite bank of Qixia Mountain, the National Army repelled more than 500 attacking Communist troops last night, killing more than 50 Communist troops and capturing three.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 12th] There is no change in the situation facing Zhenjiang today. According to a military source: The main force of the Communist army on the Yangliu line has indeed retreated, and the main force has gone to Yangzhou, but the National Army on the Liuwu front has not advanced forward. This morning, they are still firmly defending the old Siwu, Zhu Jiaqigan, Chen Jiaqiao area. The Guazhou Shierwu line is also quiet. It is also learned that, except for Guazhou, Liuwu, Shierwu, Puzhen, Yuxikou, and Hexian, the rest of the National Army's bridgeheads along the river north of the river have fallen into the hands of the Communist army.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 12th] Lin Biao's 43rd Army entered Huang'an County City from south of Hekou on the 11th, with a part of the remaining troops occupying Changxuanling.

[Our Huangpi Dispatch, 12th] According to transportation industry personnel who came here from Xinyang on the 12th: It is a fact that among the 40th and 43rd armies of Lin Biao's troops heading south, there are Japanese prisoners of war and Korean Communists. The military uniforms they wear are the same as the Communist army, and their number accounts for about 10%.

### Gui Yongqing Inspects River Defenses; Visited Zhenjiang Yesterday and Returned to Nanjing That Evening

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 12th] Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing, accompanied by Director Tao Diya of the Political Warfare Department and more than ten others, arrived in Zhenjiang by car from Nanjing at 9:00 AM on the 12th.

### People of Anqing are Peaceful and Quiet; Our Reporter Visits the City

[Our Anqing Dispatch, 12th] After a three-day journey, our reporter arrived in Anqing from Jiujiang and entered Anqing, the famous city that had been fiercely fought for 21 days, at 6:00 PM on the 12th. That evening, he was introduced to Commander Wu Zhongjian, the defending general, by Colonel Bao Shiqi. The city of Anqing is orderly and the people are peaceful and quiet. Since the start of the Anqing defense battle, this newspaper is the first to send a reporter to the city for interviews.

### National Army Has Long Ceased Offensives; No Need to Issue Ceasefire Order

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Local evening newspapers reported that the government had formally signed and issued a ceasefire order by the Ministry of National Defense at 3:00 PM on the 11th. After this reporter investigated with relevant parties, they all said "they had not heard of it." Military command units at all levels have also not yet received this order. Furthermore, according to a senior official in charge of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, since the President officially advocated peace in his New Year's Day address, the National Army has not launched any attacks on the Communist army. Therefore, this ceasefire order is actually unnecessary for the National Army.

### Legislative Yuan Holds Secret Meeting; Liu Gongyun Reports on Finance; Imbalance of Revenue and Expenditure; Issuing Banknotes Was Truly a Last Resort; Committee Members Mainly Propose Increasing Revenue and Oppose Selling Off

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] The Legislative Yuan held a plenary session on the morning of the 12th, and Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun was invited to attend and answer inquiries. During the meeting, a majority of 107 votes to 106 votes passed a motion to hold a secret meeting, where Liu Gongyun answered the inquiries raised by Legislative Yuan members Liu Shidu and 42 others. It was stated that: (1) The issuance of large banknotes was to meet needs. The fundamental problem at present is the imbalance between revenue and expenditure. The government is trying to increase tax revenue, and has proposed methods such as tax dollars and customs dollars in the amended financial and monetary reform plan. It is hoped that the Legislative Yuan will pass and implement them as soon as possible. (2) The relocation of gold, silver, and foreign exchange to Taiwan, South China, and other places is for safety considerations and was done under orders. They can be transported back at any time. The purpose of selling off gold is to contract the currency in circulation and suppress prices. Moreover, it is sold at market prices, so buyers have no profit to be made. (3) The issuance policy is a last resort. In fact, the fact that finance can be maintained to this day is due to currency issuance. The government will still do its best to improve the treatment of military personnel, civil servants, and educators, as well as contract the currency in circulation and stabilize prices. (4) The government has always maintained cultural undertakings, so it provided loans of 60 million yuan to each newspaper in Nanjing. I have no prejudice against this. When the meeting continued in the afternoon, various committee members raised questions, all opposing the contraction of currency in circulation by selling off gold and silver, advocating for increasing tax revenue to replace the issuance policy, and showing the courage to reform the monetary system. Those who did not have time to speak submitted written questions, which Liu Gongyun answered in writing. The secret meeting then ended.

### Yu Dawei Recuperating in Shanghai; To Undergo Surgery Soon; Extremely Concerned About Transportation Situation in Nanjing and Shanghai

[Our Report] Mr. Yu Dawei arrived in Shanghai from Taiwan the day before yesterday. According to him: Since going to Taiwan on February 7th, he has been out of touch with the outside world for a long time due to the need for rest due to illness, so he understands little about the evolution of current affairs. When the reporter asked for his views on the peace talks, Mr. Yu humbly said: The work he has undertaken in the past has been technical, and the peace talks are rich in political significance, making it difficult to judge. Mr. Yu expressed great concern about the traffic conditions on the Nanjing-Shanghai route, and believes that whether the shelling along the coast north of the Yangtze River can cut off traffic on the Nanjing-Shanghai line depends on the general situation. According to Mr. Yu himself: He will undergo surgery again soon, so he needs a considerable period of recuperation and cannot take on any duties.

### Regarding the Arrest of Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian: Heated Debate in the Legislative Yuan, Committee Members Speak Out Demanding Concrete Protection of Human Rights, Resulting in the Passage of a Resolution Requiring the Executive Yuan to Punish According to Law

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The arrest of Legislative Yuan members Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian caused a great uproar during the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 12th. Committee members expressed indignation at the illegal arrest of legislators by military authorities. The measures taken by President He [Yingqin] apparently gained the approval of the legislators; however, most legislators still demanded that the person primarily responsible, Tang Enbo, commander of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, be identified and that the Executive Yuan be requested to punish him. After much debate, a resolution was finally passed. The case was brought up in the morning by President Tong [Guanxian] in the form of a temporary report, in which he immediately explained that committee members Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian were arrested the day before by the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters and that the Legislative Yuan had negotiated with Executive Yuan President He [Yingqin] for their release. He also said that Committee Member Jin [Shaoxian] had been released at 11:00 p.m. that night, and Committee Member Xu [Wentian] arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 12th, where he was picked up by Secretary-General Chen [Kewen] and returned to his residence to rest, and was scheduled to attend the Legislative Yuan meeting in the afternoon to report. Regarding this matter, President He [Yingqin] had sent a letter explaining the handling of the situation. The original letter was read out immediately (see separate article). Subsequently, Jin Shaoxian, at the request of the committee members, reported on his arrest (the content was the same as that published in this newspaper on the 12th). Jin [Shaoxian] said: "The handling of this incident shows that the Executive Yuan still has power, which is very gratifying." Zhang Jiuru then spoke, saying that although the Executive Yuan's handling was good, it should not only pay attention to the central government in the future, but also to arrest incidents at the local level. Shao Jingren said: "The arrest of legislators this time is an unconstitutional act. He advocated a serious inquiry to pursue responsibility and severely punish those responsible to safeguard the constitution." The chairman announced: "Can this case be discussed again after Committee Member Xu [Wentian] reports in the afternoon?" There was no objection. After the closed-door meeting in the afternoon, the Legislative Yuan meeting was reconvened, and Xu Wentian was immediately invited to report on his arrest (see separate article). Subsequently, committee members spoke one after another, criticizing the illegality of this act. Xiao Juetian said: "The Legislative Yuan cannot protect the basic freedoms of the people, and even its own basic freedoms cannot be protected," which was heartbreaking. Niu Jianchu said that the Communist Party created a red terror, and the government must not create a white terror. He advocated that in addition to their own safety, they should also pay attention to protecting human rights. Zou Shuwen said that there were too many arrest agencies everywhere, and hoped that they could be simplified. Wu Hexuan said that this was a serious constitutional issue, and the government should be asked whether it wanted a constitution. Regarding the handling of this case, the committee members unanimously advocated consulting the Executive Yuan on the following: (1) Investigate the responsibility and find out who issued the order; (2) The organizers are so absurd that they should be investigated and severely punished within a week; (3) Issue a circular to military and police agencies that, except for criminals caught in the act, they must not arrest legislators without authorization; (4) Human rights should be effectively protected in the future, but there were differing opinions on whether the person primarily responsible should be identified. After Wu Hexuan declared that he was a friend of Tang Enbo, he said that Tang Enbo should bear full responsibility and be punished. Huang Yuren also said: "President He's letter has proved that Tang [Enbo] should be responsible." Yang Gongda advocated that Tang Enbo should be punished after the investigation. A chorus of boos immediately arose from the audience, and the meeting became chaotic as a result. Shao Jingren said: "The responsibility should be borne by Tang [Enbo], but the Legislative Yuan is not a judicial body and cannot designate who is responsible. The Executive Yuan can be consulted to investigate this person in highest authority and severely punish him." Huang Yuren still expressed his opposition, and after a long dispute, Chen Guda finally proposed a revised opinion, which was: "According to President He's letter, Tang Enbo has already requested punishment. In order to maintain the dignity of the Constitution, the Executive Yuan should punish him according to law." This was finally passed. In addition, the committee members' opinions, including the effective protection of human rights, the severe punishment of those responsible within a week, the investigation and thorough disbandment of all secret service organizations by the Executive Yuan, and the request that the Executive Yuan order the organizers to report and submit evidence of Committee Member Xu's incitement to rebellion, so that Committee Member Xu could respond and the truth could be ascertained before the General Assembly made a decision, were all submitted to the Executive Yuan for handling.

Xu Wentian Returned to Nanjing Yesterday Morning: No Mistreatment or Torture in Shanghai, Said He Did Not Want to Expand on This Misunderstanding

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Legislative Yuan member Xu Wentian, who was arrested in Nanjing, was released in Shanghai on the evening of the 11th and took the night train to Nanjing on the morning of the 12th. Chen Zuming, the senior staff officer in charge of the case, came with him. After getting off the train, they went to the Executive Yuan together. Because Xu's release from the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters was handled according to the order of Executive Yuan President He Yingqin, he handed Xu over to Huang Shaogu, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. Xu told Huang [Shaogu] about the process of being arrested and released, and then returned to his residence to rest. In the afternoon, he attended the Legislative Yuan to report on his arrest. When reporters visited him, he said: "I don't want to expand on this misunderstanding. There was no mistreatment or torture from the time I was arrested to the time I was released." According to what he knew, after being arrested on the 10th, two people were taken from the Weishu Headquarters to the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters at the same time, one surnamed Fang, who is still being held in Shanghai, and one surnamed Jia, who swallowed gold after being arrested and was sent to the hospital for treatment after being discovered. Both of them are employees of the Farmers and Workers News Agency. When reporters asked whether Commander Tang Enbo's report to President He [Yingqin] that "recent evidence has been obtained that Committee Member Xu [Wentian] is suspected of inciting a major military rebellion" was related, Xu [Wentian] replied: "This matter happened a long time ago and has nothing to do with me. I used to be the Director of Education of the Jiangsu Provincial Training Corps, so I have many friends in the organization. The rebellion referred to may be the Jiangsu Provincial Security Second Brigade Commander in Zhenjiang and Tao Hongzhao and Suzhou Water Police Bureau Chief Zhang Shaohua, but Tao [Hongzhao] and Zhang [Shaohua] have been arrested." Xu [Wentian] admitted that if he were not a legislator, he might not have been released so smoothly. According to reports, Xu's release was the result of the Legislative Yuan's protest to the Executive Yuan that the arrest was illegal, but the Xu case has not been concluded, and Xu did not deny this point when talking to reporters.

Report in the Legislative Yuan on the Arrest and Release

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] Legislative Yuan member Xu Wentian reported to the Legislative Yuan on the afternoon of the 12th about his arrest and release, saying: "After being arrested at the Wenfeng Bookstore at about 2:00 p.m. on the 10th, I was taken to the Guard Group of the Weishu Headquarters. At 4:00 p.m., I was sent to the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters in Xiaolingwei. At 10:00 p.m., I was taken by car to Zhenjiang Station and transferred to a train. On the morning of the 11th, I arrived in Shanghai, first sent to the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, and then sent to another place by the police department. Until the evening, I was sent back to the station and took the military train back to Nanjing." Xu [Wentian] said: "This arrest was a misunderstanding, because they have an organization called the 'Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance', which was established last spring. The main purpose is to seek the re-development of the Three People's Principles. The members are all members of the Kuomintang, and it has developed very rapidly in recent years, which has attracted much attention. All parties do not fully understand this organization. Recently, many members of the alliance in various places have been arrested. I am also a member of the alliance, so it may have caused a misunderstanding." Xu [Wentian] then stated that when he was interrogated in Shanghai, he wrote a statement together with them. The statement had pre-existing topics, many of which he did not understand. He could only ask for their opinions and write according to them, and he could not admit this statement. Xu [Wentian] also said: "From the day before yesterday to this morning, I saw many civilians and soldiers being arrested. I believe that ordinary people who commit crimes should be tried by judicial organs and do not want to be detained by military organs. I hope that the Legislative Yuan will correct this point. As for me personally, I hope that the Legislative Yuan will not cause waves because of this matter. The current environment is difficult and peace talks are underway. I don't want to cause waves because of personal issues and affect the peace talks."

President He Ordered an Investigation of Responsibility: Commander Tang Requested Punishment

He's Letter to Tong Guanxian

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] The full text of the letter from Executive Yuan President He Yingqin to Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian is as follows: "President Tong Guanxian, Today (11th), Secretary-General Chen Kewen of your esteemed Yuan visited and learned that Committee Members Xu Wentian and Jin Shaoxian of your esteemed Yuan were suddenly arrested by military organs yesterday. Committee Member Jin [Shaoxian] has been released, and Committee Member Xu [Wentian] has been sent to Shanghai. I was very surprised by this, because this kind of behavior is illegal. I immediately telegraphed Tang Enbo, Commander of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, who said: 'Recent evidence has been obtained that Committee Member Xu [Wentian] is suspected of inciting a major military rebellion, and I ordered Wan Jianfan, Deputy Commander of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, to investigate and handle the matter. Unexpectedly, Chen Zuming, the staff officer in charge of the case in Nanjing, did not understand the provisions of the Constitution and arrested him without authorization without reporting to Deputy Commander Wan [Jianfan], which was very inappropriate. Although I am responsible for the oversight, I should submit a request for punishment.' When I inquired about Deputy Commander Wan, he said: 'Staff Officer Chen Zuming did not ask him for instructions.' Yingqin immediately telegraphed Commander Tang [Enbo] to immediately release Committee Member Xu [Wentian] and send someone to accompany him to Nanjing. He also detained Chen Zuming and sent him to Nanjing for punishment according to law. At the same time, he ordered the Ministry of National Defense to thoroughly investigate the matter, pursue responsibility, and issue a circular to military and police agencies to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. He also ordered the Ministry to submit a detailed report on the ins and outs of this case. I am forwarding this to you for your information, and please forward it to the committee members of your esteemed Yuan. I respectfully wish you good health, Your brother, He Yingqin, April 11." (More details about Xu's arrest will be published on page 2.)

Although there is a glimmer of hope for peace talks, the military situation on the northern bank of the Yangtze River is temporarily in a state of stalemate; however, the situation surrounding Wuhan is still outwardly relaxed but inwardly tense, and future developments are worth noting. According to the current situation in Wuhan, after the troops commanded by General Bai Chongxi withdrew from Zhumadian, Henan, all the way to Xiaogan, on the outskirts of Wuhan, the Communist army seemed to be gradually approaching the bridgeheads for crossing the Yangtze River in eastern Hubei, central Hubei, and western Hubei from the two wings of the southern section of the Pinghan Railway, and Hankou has become a stronghold protruding from the northern bank of the Yangtze River. Now eastern and western Hubei are feeling increasingly heavy pressure from the Communist army. After the national army in Huangmei and Xishui in eastern Hubei retreated, the national army on the outskirts of Wuhan is currently strengthening the defenses in the Xiaogan and Huangpi areas. On the 10th, the northbound train on the Pinghan Railway only reached Hengdian, and the military crisis is imminent. The national army's transfer in this area is naturally not a defeat, but entirely for strategic reasons, in order to strengthen the defense of the outskirts of Wuhan. Judging from the attitude and determination of the national army, Wuhan can be defended. Despite the increasingly tight surrounding situation, General Bai Chongxi is confident and will be able to defend Greater Wuhan at all costs.

Wuhan is the abdomen of the Yangtze River, the central stream, and its situation is important; taking Wuhan's location as an example, if we draw a circle with a radius of 1,000 miles, Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin), Nanjing-Shanghai, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Xi'an, and Taiyuan are all within the scope, which is enough to show that Wuhan occupies a central position in China's geography. Wuhan, that is, the general name of the three towns of Hankou, Hanyang, and Wuchang, in terms of its strategic location, is surrounded by the Yangtze River and the Han River, connecting north and south. In the past, it was called the thoroughfare of nine provinces, the key to north-south transportation. To the northwest, the Han River can reach Shaanxi and Gansu, and to the east and west, the Yangtze River can reach Yunnan, Sichuan, Jiangsu, and Anhui; in addition, the Pinghan Railway extends north to Beiping and Hebei and Henan provinces, and the Yuehan Railway extends south to Guangzhou, which can connect eastern Guangdong and is the center of transportation throughout the country. The Book of Songs says "滔滔江漢" (surging Yangtze and Han), "如江如漢" (like the Yangtze and Han), "江漢浮浮" (floating Yangtze and Han), "江漢湯湯" (abundant Yangtze and Han), which is not a song praising the water of the Yangtze and Han rivers, but actually praising the situation of Wuhan, which has an abundant and surging momentum, and its every movement and float is enough to connect the north and south. Because of the importance of Wuhan's situation, in any military conflict in Chinese history, the gain or loss of this place has been the key to success or failure for those using troops in the north and south. The ancients said: "The Chu of the Spring and Autumn Period was a frequent contention for military strategists." The history of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods can be said to be the history of the disputes in the Chu area, which is enough to show that the contest for the strategic location of Chu by the north and south is greatly related to a turning point in history. At the beginning of the Republic of China, the uprising of the Xinhai Revolution was the first, and the whole country responded to it. In less than a year, the country was restored and the republic was created. Although the demise of the Qing Dynasty also had its reasons, only by occupying the ground and gaining momentum could it be so effective so quickly, which was definitely not accidental. This not only illustrates the importance of Wuhan's situation, but also the importance of Wuhan's defense.

To defend Wuhan, it is necessary to consolidate its periphery first; otherwise, it will not be easy to maintain peace for a long time. The Battle of Wuhan in the War of Resistance Against Japan did not take place in the core, but in the outer perimeter. The so-called Wuhan periphery has a very wide range, with Wuxue and Xinshan in the east, as well as Jiujiang and Hukou, and even further to Pengze and Madang; to the north along the Pinghan Railway, there are the dangers of the Tongbai Mountains and Jigong Mountain, and the importance of the Yiyang Three Passes; to the northwest along the Han River, there is the solidity of Xiangfan, which has always been the lock of the north and south. To the west is the land of Jingzhou, where Jiangling is located, controlling the key routes of Ba and Kui, connecting the upper reaches of Wuhan, embracing Xiangfan to the north, connecting Changde and Yuanling to the south, bordering the Yangtze and Han rivers, and arching the arms of Wu and Chu. As Zhuge Wuhou said, it is a country where military force is used, and as Gu Zuyu said, it is an important town in Huguang. Wuhan is not only the throat of the two lakes, but also the throat of the Yangtze River. Today, the Communist army is eyeing Wuhan, intending to approach this throat to facilitate the control of central China, threaten Nanjing and Shanghai, shake southern China, and cut off the connection between Sichuan and Kang to the outside world. Therefore, the gain or loss of Wuhan is too important and worthy of close attention from the government and the public.

Looking at the current situation of the national and communist armies, the national army must defend Wuhan, and the communist army must strive to seize Wuhan. Therefore, the struggle for the periphery of Wuhan is difficult to avoid a fierce battle. We cannot make premature predictions about the future evolution of Wuhan, but we can point out that the gain or loss of Wuhan is greatly related to the progress of the peace talks, and it is greatly related to the superior and inferior situation of the national and communist armies. Therefore, today's Wuhan and its defense are worthy of our deep attention and concern.

### New Disturbances Brewing in Western Hunan: Fifteen or Sixteen People Want to Be Military Commanders, Pacification Is Difficult, Yang Guangyao and Zhou Qing's Troops Stirring, Yuanling Becomes Tense Again

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 12th] It is widely rumored here that another change is brewing in western Hunan, with many "heroes" supporting Chen Quzhen, the old "King of Western Hunan" who has been in seclusion for a long time, as their leader, and using Li Jishen's "Kuomintang Reform Committee" as a front. Among them, Yang Guangyao, who is indeed in contact with the Reform Committee, has gathered nearly 10,000 people and is advancing towards Yuanling, and Yuanling, whose wounds have not yet healed, is trembling again.

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 12th] Song Xilian is finding the work of pacifying the civilian armed forces in western Hunan quite difficult. It is said that there are too many people in western Hunan who want to be promoted, and there are as many as fifteen or sixteen people who want to obtain the position of military commander. Recently, various "heroes" led by Zhou Xieqing have gathered thousands of people and guns between Fenghuang and Qiancheng, and are planning to launch another attack in western Hunan. Zhou [Xieqing] contacted Wang Yuanhua and Cao Zhenya of Yongshun in advance, and held a meeting in Majia'ao, Qiancheng, at the beginning of this month. Participants included Wu Hengliang of Yongshui, Huang Daxun of Baojing, Xu Hanzhang of Luxi, Pan Zhuangfei of Qianyang, Long Feitian of Mayang, and Zhang Dazhi of Gucheng.

Their intention is to advance on Changde and Taojiang in two routes, one via Yongshun and Dayong, and the other via Yuanling. Xiong Zilin's troops under Zhou [Xieqing] have advanced to the border of Qiancheng, and Yuanling has entered a state of tension again. According to reports, Zhou [Xieqing] is from Xiushan, Sichuan. More than a decade ago, he entered Hunan with a gun and was incorporated by Chen Quzhen, serving as a brigade commander in Chen's troops. In the 29th year of the Republic [1940], Gu Zhutong revoked his number due to the discipline of Zhou's troops and detained Zhou, who was later acquitted and released. He then resided in Nanjing and Shanghai, and only recently returned from Shanghai. He happened to be in Yuanling when it fell last time.

### Two Battalions of Rebellious Army in Shijing, Guangdong, All Return to Guangzhou, Two Battalion Commanders Flee to Macau in Fear of Punishment

Commander Ge [Xiancai] also returned to Guangzhou from Jiangmen to report the pacification process to Yu Hanmou. According to a senior official of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, their rebellion was mainly due to the low pay and not due to political conspiracy. He pointed out that if there were political relations, they would have fled to northern Guangdong or eastern Jiangnan Road, and would never have fled to the bag-shaped area of Zhongshan Doumen, waiting for the national army to surround them. He also said that the soldiers of the two battalions that returned to Guangzhou did not lose a single gun or bullet.

As for the students who have returned, they deeply regret being deceived this time. I have decided to follow the instructions of the Commander-in-Chief and treat them leniently without further investigation."

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 12th] After the First Headquarters of the He National Defense Ministry Yu Gan was coerced to rebel by the former Commander Jia Yibin, a part of more than 700 people crossed the national army's defense line on the 10th and went to Mogan Mountain, intending to enter Tianmu Mountain.

### Chen Bijun Has Many Troubles in Prison: There Is Also a Dispute Over US Dollars

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 12th] It is rumored that the traitor Chen Bijun recently submitted a petition to the authorities of the Shizikou Prison, requesting them to force Chen Shibiao, the director of the traitorous Nantong Chamber of Commerce who had been released on bail, to compensate her for 1,000 US dollars that she had been defrauded of. It is said that this huge amount of US dollars was given to her by a certain important person during a visit because of her difficult situation. Later, a traitorous Chen [Shibiao] in the same cell deceived her into handing it over to him to find a way to do business and make profits. Unexpectedly, not long after, he claimed that it had all been lost, and he himself was released on bail, causing Chen Bijun to be very resentful and report it to the authorities. However, according to reporters' investigations, last year there was a rumor in prison that Chen Bijun had several hundred US dollars of her own to do business outside, which was lost. Chen [Bijun] vehemently denied it after hearing about it, and complained a lot in prison. Therefore, the current rumor of being defrauded of 1,000 US dollars may be far-fetched.

### Suzhou County Bank Embezzlement Case; County Government Submits to the Provincial Finance Department for Handling

[Our Newspaper Suzhou, 12th Dispatch] The case of the county bank acting as the county treasury's agent for delaying the payment of taxes is suspected of embezzlement. The county government sent personnel to investigate, and it has come to an end. According to reporters, it was found that there were three tax payments with inconsistent registration dates, totaling more than 30,000 gold yuan. The county government has now reported this case to the provincial finance department for handling. Although the bank has made some justifications, the advantages of the new accounting system can prevent forgotten entries, so even if it is forgotten, it can be discovered on the same day. Currently, just looking at the tax payment of Demei Company, the registration dates are a month apart, which seems to be far from being disguised by the word "negligence."

### Inside Story of the Arrest of Legislator Xu Wentian; Repeatedly Inciting Military Rebellion with Conclusive Evidence; Processing Personnel Unfamiliar with Legal Procedures Also Detained

[Our Newspaper News] Regarding the arrest of legislator Xu Wentian, in order to understand the truth of the case, the reporter visited the security agency yesterday and learned the inside story as follows: Xu belongs to the so-called "Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance" (please refer to page 5 today), and once served as the military minister of the alliance. He is currently the "General Commander of the National Self-Defense Army of Jiangsu and Anhui," and also acts as the organization minister of the alliance. In fact, this organization is an external group of the Communist Party. Xu began his activities in Chongqing as early as the summer of 1945. He successively participated in the Kuomintang Revolutionary New Faction, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Social Party, and the Three Principles of the People Revolutionary Alliance, until recently participating in the Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance. This organization specializes in penetrating military agencies in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, plotting military rebellion by the National Army, local troops, and senior generals, in order to welcome the Communist army to cross the Yangtze River. It is a planned and purposeful incitement organization. In the past few months, several mutinies have been caused by Xu's instigation: In February of this year, Tao Hongzhao, commander of the Second Jiangsu Security Brigade and commander of the Zhenjiang city defense, was first instigated by Xu to attempt to welcome the Communist army to cross the Yangtze River at the end of February. Fortunately, the authorities discovered it early and arrested Tao on February 24 with lightning speed. This was Xu's first instigation attempt. Because Xu was a legislator, the security agency personnel only sent personnel to follow and monitor him and did not arrest him. In late March, Wang Yanchang, commander of the 97th Division stationed in Tangshan, a suburb of Nanjing, led his troops to defect to the Communists. This was Xu's second instigation attempt. At the same time, Xu sent Zhang Dasheng (member of the Huaiyin Huazhong District Working Committee of the Communist Army's Fourth Army Commander), Chen Titi (former member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, currently the person in charge of the Shanghai branch of the alliance), and Yan Yimin (identity unknown) to Shanghai to conduct activities with the garrison troops. They were arrested by security agency personnel on March 28 while holding a secret meeting at the Nanjing Hotel on Shanxi Road. Recently, a mutiny occurred among some officers and soldiers of the pre-cadre corps stationed in Jiaxing, which was Xu's third instigation attempt. The above are the major examples. Xu has conducted activities with more than a dozen other units, and the security agency has collected confirmed intelligence and evidence, believing that at a time when the Communist army is attempting to cross the Yangtze River, it is essential to ensure security in Jiangnan. Xu's actions affect public morale, so they had no choice but to order Xu's arrest on the 10th of this month. Another legislator, Jin Shaoxian, was mistakenly arrested because he worked with Xu. After investigation, he was released immediately. After Xu was arrested, he admitted without hesitation to instigating the mutiny during questioning, and wrote a detailed account of the instigation process in his confession, saying that the mutinous troops were under the command of Communist Army commander Chen Yi. Because legislators who are not caught in the act cannot be arrested according to the Constitution, the security agency escorted Xu to Nanjing by overnight train the day before yesterday to complete the legal procedures before formally interrogating him. A total of seven people were arrested in this case. In addition to Xu Wentian, Tao Hongzhao, Chen Titi, Zhang Dasheng, and Yan Yimin, there were also Fang Zhinong (secretary of the Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance) and Lu Bihu (current county magistrate of Jiangning County, former chief of the Longhua North Station Police Sub-bureau in Shanghai), who were also arrested in the same case. In addition, the heads of the alliance's propaganda department and liaison department, labor movement social department, finance department, and speech research committee are all well-known figures. The security agency is rushing to complete the procedures and will round them up in one fell swoop.

[Central News Agency This City Dispatch] Regarding the arrest of legislator Xu Wentian, the reporter visited General Commander Tang Enbo. According to Tang, the personnel handling this case were unfamiliar with legal procedures and acted rashly, which he regretted very much. The personnel handling this case have now been detained and will be severely punished, and Xu was escorted back to Nanjing on the night of the 11th.

### Truman Sends Special Message to Congress Urging Approval of the North Atlantic Treaty; Emphasizes that the Treaty is an Important Step Towards the Road to Peace; Senate Debate Will Take at Least One Month

[Our Newspaper News] Washington, 12th Broadcast: President Truman has submitted the North Atlantic Treaty to the Senate for approval. The President's message to the Senate stated that the treaty is an important step in realizing the American people's determination to establish a just and lasting peace. The President also indirectly denied the Soviet Union's accusation that the treaty conflicts with the United Nations Charter. The President stated that the 12 signatory countries of the treaty are exercising their right to "collective or individual self-defense against aggressors" in accordance with Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. The President originally intended to send a letter to the Senate only, but because he was eager for the treaty to be approved as soon as possible, he decided to send another message on the weekend. The President stated, "This treaty is only one step on the road to peace, for to seek peace is not something that can be accomplished by taking just one action. We must continue to consider the environment with caution and patience and take practical and realistic steps to build a sound and solid peace. This treaty is drafted to address the current actual situation, based on the United Nations Charter and the United States Constitution. This treaty truly represents the American people's desire for peace and security and the continued opportunity to live and work freely." The President did not address the economic responsibilities that the United States should bear in implementing the treaty. The President also stated, "The people of the North Atlantic group have now reached a sacred agreement, guaranteeing the security of all small countries, so that their peace and rights will no longer be threatened by terror and oppression. All countries share weal and woe, for economic prosperity or military security cannot be achieved by the sole efforts of one country."

The President also stated that the "combined strength" of the North Atlantic Treaty nations will be of extreme importance to the free people of the world in the future. Since all countries are committed to human rights and justice, differences in language and political and economic systems will not become obstacles to international unity. The establishment of this treaty is proof of this.

[United States Information Service Washington, 11th Dispatch] Before the provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty become binding on the United States, they must first be approved by a two-thirds majority of the Senate. It is generally believed that the treaty will be approved. Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, revealed today that the hearing on the security alliance will begin next Monday and will continue to hold "fully open" discussions for about a month.

### Lie Proposes Establishing International Guard Force, Soviet Bloc Firmly Opposes, Political Committee Refers to Fourteen-Nation Subcommittee for Study

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 11th] Secretary-General of the United Nations Trygve Lie's proposal to establish an International Guard Force of 800 personnel to protect United Nations mediators caused heated debate in the Second Political Committee of the General Assembly today. The Soviet bloc argued that this move violated the United Nations Charter, and that such a guard force would only facilitate military and political intervention in foreign countries by the United States and Britain. The Polish representative, Suchi, said, "I hope that the Secretary-General will not propose unconstitutional suggestions again. The Secretary-General's hands are already full of unconstitutional actions, such as the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the Atlantic Treaty, and so on. The Secretary-General should instead encourage the member states, especially those generally busy organizing armies outside the United Nations, to devote themselves to the establishment of a United Nations army." The Soviet representative, Malik, stated that the plan to establish a guard force attempts to bypass the Security Council and replace it with an international police force. Subsequently, the committee voted 41 to 6 (the Soviet bloc voting against, with three abstentions) to establish a fourteen-nation subcommittee to study Lie's proposal and submit a report to the General Assembly this autumn. The Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia were also appointed as subcommittee representatives, but those countries may refuse to participate.

### Japan Follows Germany's Lead

Allied Powers Lifting Military Control over Germany Will Set Precedent for Relaxing Control over Japan

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 12th] An Allied diplomat stated today that the lifting of military control over Germany might set a precedent for relaxing control over Japan. There is almost unanimous agreement that controls can be relaxed, and this is inevitable, but there are doubts as to whether Japan can automatically escape from its post-war economic plight. Once a West German government is established, world attention may shift to Japan to see if it can become self-reliant. At that time, some pressure may arise to try the same approach in Japan, including pressure from the Japanese themselves.

### German Leaders to Discuss New Occupation Regulations with Allied Authorities, Maintaining Control Fails to Satisfy Germany

[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 12th (Broadcast): Bonn reports that the Social Democratic Party of West Germany has informed the Allied occupation authorities that they do not intend to discuss the constitutional assembly's stalemate regarding the drafting of the West German constitution with the Allied authorities, reiterating that Germans should draft the constitution themselves and then submit it to the Allied powers for approval. The Social Democratic Party suggested refusing to participate in the talks with the Allied authorities. After the Christian Democratic Party and other parties voted in favor of participating, the Socialist Party also agreed to participate, but only on the condition that the scope of the negotiations be limited to the occupation regulations and not involve the constitutional assembly's stalemate. The meeting is scheduled to be held this Thursday in Frankfurt.

[United Press, Bonn, 12th] The prime ministers of the German states jointly issued a declaration today stating that the West German occupation regulations did not realize Germany's important wishes, such as Germany's foreign trade still being subject to control, but that these regulations are also a fundamental step in rebuilding the sovereignty of the German people. The value of these regulations will be determined by the extent of their implementation.

### Why Has the United States Lost Ground in Asia?

— Translated by Special Correspondent from Our Newspaper

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has been successful by exploiting the traditional assets of Chinese peasants and the public's resentment towards the Nationalist government. Chinese peasants are the easiest to manipulate, and the CCP's promise to give them land is a powerful attraction. These peasants support the CCP in the hope that a change of situation will improve their fate. A certain Chinese Communist Party member told that interviewer: "Our most effective propaganda is land."

This propaganda is very effective. Once a region is occupied by the Communist army, there are very few peasants there who strive for the return of the Nationalist army. The CCP leaders have managed to make the peasants benefit from the civil war, so none of them are willing to risk their lives to fight for the return of the Nationalist army.

American officials, who support the Nationalist Party as the strongest anti-communist force, have no way to thoroughly reform the Nationalist government and eliminate the corruption that even Chiang Kai-shek has condemned. According to an American official stationed in China, for every dollar the United States invests in combating the CCP, it receives back less than ten cents.

Foreigners traveling in China have received proof of the Nationalist Party's poor anti-communist capabilities. Americans who have worked for many years to improve the effectiveness of the Nationalist government, with few exceptions, seem to find that their efforts are met with failure everywhere.

Now, in response to the CCP's victory, some suggest that the United States land its army in China to maintain the remaining part of China. But the reactions from all sides are very sensitive. Some officials in the US State Department believe that this action may involve the Americans in an endless war whirlpool, with the risk of being unanimously opposed by non-communist elements in China.

Southeast Asia Unanimously Opposes

The traditional color of colonialism has died in this region. The people of Indonesia and Vietnam are almost frantically demanding to get rid of the rule of the Netherlands and France. Because the United States desperately promoted the importance of the four basic freedoms and people's autonomy during the war, the rebel leaders fully hoped that the United States would help them fight for freedom. Now their dreams have been shattered and they feel resentment. They blame the United States for standing by.

Recently, a journalist traveled to Indonesia and witnessed the public's deep hatred of the Dutch and the rising anti-American sentiment. Most Indonesians believe that the United States is only paying lip service to the Indonesian Republic, while indirectly helping the Netherlands maintain the East Indies. Because the European Recovery Program includes France and the Netherlands, people in the Far East feel that the United States is not only not helping the colonies, but is favoring the colonizing countries.

Although the United States has strongly criticized the Dutch military operations in Indonesia (which the Dutch call "police actions") in the United Nations, the rebel leaders demand that the United States follow up its strong words with strong actions. The Communist Party has repeatedly announced to the Indonesian people that they have been betrayed by the United States. This policy of the Communist Party has gained a foothold.

On the bookstalls in Yogyakarta, the capital of the Indonesian Republic, there are almost entirely Marxist propaganda pamphlets. A 23-year-old Indonesian journalist frankly told an American reporter that he would be willing to take on underground work and follow any leader - even a communist - to participate in guerrilla warfare against the Dutch.

In Vietnam, a French official estimated that 95 percent of the natives were Nationalists, determined to resist French rule. An underground army has encircled the French in six cities, and even these areas are not safe places.

Several years ago, Vietnamese guerrillas hoped that the United States would help them fight for independence. On the contrary, US Lend-Lease weapons appeared on the French side. Therefore, they turned to the Communist Party and let them lead the struggle for freedom.

A young medical graduate, who had just returned from the front line of guerrilla warfare, spoke to an American reporter about the United States' assistance to France through the Marshall Plan, and was filled with indignation. He explained in the following words why he supported Vietnamese Communist leader Ho Chi Minh: "We follow Ho Chi Minh not as communists, but as nationalists. We have no other way. Even those who oppose communism would rather be ruled by our own communists than by the French."

The Good Feelings of the Past Have Been Completely Lost

Since the end of the war against Japan, various parts of Asia have repeatedly shown disappointment with the United States. The American promises of the four basic freedoms that inspired the Burmese people to fight for independence were distributed in leaflets. The people of Malaya were convinced that it was the Americans, not the British, who could liberate them. They posted slogans in the towns saying: "Expel the Japanese and welcome the Americans."

An American journalist who traveled to ten countries in the Far East for eight months obtained an impression that can be summarized as follows:

The chaotic situation in Vietnam and Indonesia continues to exist, and most of it is attributed to the United States (whether it is fair is another question).

The United States' policy of supporting and funding the Chiang Kai-shek government has cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and has not had the slightest significant effect on curbing the progress of the CCP. The prestige of the United States is gradually being lost.

Since the United States has pursued a policy of supporting Japan's recovery, it has gradually alienated the Asian countries that are closely related to Japan's recovery. People in the Far East suspect that the result of the American occupation of Japan may create a Japan that is neither strong and democratic, nor a reliable ally of the West.

In short, a journalist who has had many years of experience in the East, after visiting various parts of Asia, has come to a belief: that the United States' Far East policy, in the past three years, has sacrificed all the good feelings that the United States previously enjoyed in this complex region.

### Authorities Seek to Resolve Economic Crisis: First Economic Meeting Summarizes Four Resolutions, Asks National Bank to Draft Measures for Using Bills

[Report from Our Newspaper] The city's Economic Conference was held at the City Hall at 4 PM yesterday, chaired by Secretary-General Chen Liang. Attendees included Zhou Lixing from the Garrison Headquarters, Xiong Daji from the Coal Adjustment Office, Gu Yuzhen from the China Textile Company, Xie Renzhao from the Transportation Control Commission, Peng Shouyi from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation, Yan Esheng from the City Chamber of Commerce, Zhou Shunxin from the National Bank, Qin Zengyuan from the Gold Management Bureau, Zhang Xu from the China Trust Bureau, Yang Chaoan from the Food Department's Procurement and Storage Committee, Ouyang Lun from the Industrial Association, Ye Fucang, Liu Qingyi, Cao Peizi, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhong Zigang from the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, and Xiang Changquan from the City Council, among others. Secretary-General Chen first clarified that in order to suppress price increases, the task of the Economic Conference is extremely important. The current economic situation has reached its most serious stage, and all sectors must work together to seek a reasonable solution. The holding of the Economic Conference can allow the responsible authorities to exchange opinions and work together actively. Subsequently, the conference discussed the organization outline of the conference, approved the draft organization of the Shanghai Economic Conference, and decided to hold regular meetings every Tuesday, and to convene temporary meetings when necessary. Then, Ye Fucang explained the reason why the price increase has evolved from a curve to a straight line increase, because the people's psychology has recognized silver dollars as currency, and the Gold Yuan has ceased to exist. He also made two suggestions to the government: (1) Unify the price of silver dollars, the price of large heads, small heads, and eagle dollars should be unified, and silver dollar deposits should be organized. (2) Bills cannot be used on the same day, which is a great hindrance to legitimate merchants, and the Central Government should make changes. Zhou Lixing then suggested eight points: (1) In order to maintain the credit of the currency, in addition to the National Bank issuing promissory notes, commercial banks should be restricted, and those that have been issued should be recalled within a time limit. (2) Strictly prohibit the use of gold and US dollars as collateral. (3) The prices of public utilities should be restricted, and the subsidy policy should still be restored. (4) Production loans should be restricted, and in the future, loans must be based on a bill of lading before lending is allowed. (5) The price of food and main daily necessities should implement a price negotiation policy. (6) Remove public telephones. (7) Ban or rationally manage silver dollar vendors. (8) Warehouse receipts must be registered, and the practice of "kicking the ball" should be strictly prohibited. He said that the first four points are fundamental solutions, and the last four points are temporary solutions, and they must be implemented in a complementary manner. Subsequently, Zhong Zigang suggested a method for the National Bank to organize silver dollar deposits. Later, Zhou Shunxin from the National Bank stated two points: (1) The problem that bills cannot be used on the same day is that after the National Bank massively dumped gold on April 4, the nine banks and firms in the city automatically made this request to the National Bank for the sake of their own safety. (2) Regarding the issue of silver dollar deposits, the Ministry of Finance originally had this intention, but no concrete measures have been formulated so far. Regarding the unification of silver dollar prices and the supervision of the market, the Garrison Headquarters suggested that all silver dollar merchants should be registered, business licenses should be issued, and designated trading areas should be designated. The Social Affairs Bureau suggested that the original members of the Silver Money Industry Association should be responsible for the buying and selling of silver dollars, and all other illegal transactions should be banned. After detailed discussion at the meeting, Secretary-General Chen summarized the discussion and decided on the following four points: (1) The plan for improving the use of bills will be drafted by the National Bank in conjunction with the Gold Management Bureau and submitted for discussion at the next meeting. If there are provisions in the usage plan promulgated by the Central Government, they should be improved with reference to the current environmental needs. If there are no explicit provisions, they should be supplemented. (2) The case of unifying silver dollar prices and improving transactions should be drafted by the National Bank and submitted for discussion at the next meeting. (3) The case of handling silver dollar deposits should be drafted by the National Bank and submitted for discussion at the meeting. (4) The case of reviewing the prices of major daily necessities and supervising the market will be drafted by the Municipal Government in conjunction with the Garrison Headquarters and submitted for discussion at the next meeting.

### Authorities Decide to Dump Large Amounts of Silver Dollars, Purchase Silver from the US for Minting in China

Since the opening of free trading of silver dollars, the market price has risen day and night, and yesterday it was more than 40,000 times higher than the price limit during the August 19th period, breaking all price increase records, stimulating general price increases, and greatly affecting people's livelihood. The relevant authorities are paying close attention to this. According to a China East News Agency reporter, the authorities decided to start dumping large amounts of silver dollars in Shanghai to curb the factors of price increases. In addition to the large amount of silver dollars exchanged during the price limit period and the new ship oceans from the Central Mint, a huge amount of silver dollars has been newly ordered from Australia. The first batch of more than one million pieces will be transported to Shanghai and will be dumped in Shanghai. Once the dumping technology is negotiated, it will begin. According to the current US silver market price, it is 70 cents per ounce. Each silver dollar is 7.2 cents, equivalent to only 50 cents in US dollars. The current Shanghai silver dollar has exceeded one US dollar per piece. Therefore, the authorities have ordered a huge amount of silver from the United States, preparing to transport it to China for dumping.

### A Set Meal Costs 10,000 Gold Yuan

Due to the drastic fluctuations in rice prices in the city, the prices of set meals continue to be adjusted. Yesterday, the price of set meals approved by the association was 10,000 yuan for Grade A, 8,600 yuan for Grade B, and 7,200 yuan for Grade C.

### Shanghai Flour Mills Face Raw Material Shortage, Approaching Major Crisis

According to statistics from the Shanghai Area Flour Industry Association, the 37 flour mills in the city currently produce 3.2 million bags per month. However, the current supply of wheat along the Beijing-Shanghai line is only sufficient for flour mills in Wuxi and other areas. Shanghai's needs are not yet secured. If the government requires each factory to store six months' worth of materials, a large amount of low-interest loans and efforts to resolve wheat source difficulties will be necessary. Yesterday, a responsible person from a major flour mill told reporters that several long-established flour mills in the city will face a major crisis after the living index is released on the 15th of this month. How they will sustain operations three or four days later is currently unpredictable.

### Taiwanese and Qinhuangdao Ships Arrive, Transporting Over Ten Thousand Tons of Coal

[Our Report] Coal continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Yanping vessel of the Taiwan Navigation Company, carrying over 5,500 tons of coal jointly operated by four mines from Keelung, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and is currently unloading at the Fourth Mine's Second Wharf (formerly the Mitsui Wharf). Additionally, the Nanqiang vessel of the Nanhui Company, bringing 6,400 tons of coal from Qinhuangdao in exchange for flour, entered the port at approximately 4:00 PM yesterday and is currently unloading at the Kailuan Wharf. It also brought 354 bags of mail. The Huasheng vessel is currently docked at buoys 20 and 21 in Nanshi, loading flour, and is scheduled to continue sailing to Qinhuangdao to exchange it for coal tomorrow.

### North and South Negotiate Changes to the Flour-for-Coal Ratio

According to the person in charge of the Coal Transport Vessel Allocation Group of the Shipping Association, the first batch of 100,000 tons of Kailuan coal from Qinhuangdao has already been completely transported. The second batch is still under negotiation due to the exchange rate issue between flour and Kailuan coal. Because the Kailuan Coal Mine authorities believe that the coal price in Shanghai is very high, they are requesting four and a half bags of flour in exchange for one ton of Kailuan coal. After negotiations between the two parties, it is hoped that four bags of flour can be exchanged for one ton of coal. It is also reported that a contract will be signed within days. Currently, ten empty ships are waiting to load flour and head north. As for the ships going north, not any ship can participate. In addition to obtaining the approval of the Executive Yuan in advance, the consent of the CCP authorities in Beiping must also be obtained by telegram, otherwise it will be difficult to sail north. Therefore, currently, only fifteen ships have been approved to participate in the northbound voyage. According to shipping industry news, with the obstruction of shipping on the Yangtze River, the business of various shipping companies has become even more sluggish. More than 60 ships with a tonnage of approximately 1,000 to 3,000 tons are about to cease operations, so the crisis in the shipping industry is becoming increasingly serious.

### China Silk Association Board Meeting Resolves to Request Immediate Implementation of Silk Loans, Appointing Three Representatives to Petition in Beijing

Silk is a special product of our country and ranks first in export trade, upon which the prosperity of rural areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang depends. Since the restoration, due to the devastation of rural areas, farmers have been unable to afford silkworm seeds, and manufacturers have also been unable to purchase fresh cocoons due to weak financial resources. Therefore, the government has implemented various low-interest loans for mulberry seedlings, seed production, silkworm rearing, and cocoon collection. The government purchases raw silk to encourage production. Since its implementation, the quality of raw silk has improved year by year. The government has been able to control a large amount of export materials, with annual silk exports reaching more than 10,000 piculs, increasing foreign exchange earnings. The rural economy has also recovered, enabling the purchase and storage of fertilizers and food rice, which is of great benefit to the stability of social order. Last autumn, due to currency reform, all loans were suspended, and silk loans could not be treated differently. As a result, the cocoon market was in chaos, and silkworm farmers had no way to sell their products, and were forced to steam and dry them, resulting in the loss of valuable raw materials, which is deeply regrettable. Now that the spring cocoon season is approaching, the China Silk Association, in view of the importance of silk loans, convened a joint meeting of the second board of directors and supervisors at 216 Wujin Road on the 10th of this month, chaired by Chairman Leng Yuqiu. A total of 59 directors and supervisors attended. First, Leng Yuqiu delivered a speech, followed by a detailed report by He Shangping, a standing director, on his trip to France last autumn to attend the World Raw Silk Conference. After unanimous resolution, telegrams were sent to the Executive Yuan and the Central Bank, requesting that various silk loans be implemented quickly to reassure farmers and merchants. Three representatives were appointed to go to Beijing to visit the competent authorities to petition, in order to prevent the goods from being abandoned on the ground and missing the agricultural season.

It is also learned that the key resolutions of the joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors of the association also include the establishment of a Silk Academic Research Committee to be responsible for research, publication, investigation and other work, in order to seek improvement.

(3) Hunan University, Shandong University and other schools urged the initiation of a National College and University Staff Association. It was decided to temporarily reserve this matter. (4) The staff of Yingshi University were approved as members of the association. The applications for membership from Xiamen University and Shandong University were temporarily reserved due to the long distance. (5) The preferential treatment for staff of various member colleges and universities at the Sino-American Hospital has been agreed to in principle by the hospital and will be implemented soon.

### Cash Required for Train Tickets, Promissory Notes and Drafts Not Accepted

[Our Report] Recently, there has been a shortage of cash in the market, and promissory notes are rampant. The Railway Bureau sells tickets and stipulates that cash must be used. However, the general public is unaware of the truth and still uses promissory notes to request tickets from the North Station, resulting in repeated disputes. The railway authorities discussed the issue of promissory note purchases at a bureau affairs meeting some time ago. The result was based on Article 6 of the Eighth Edition Passenger Vehicle Transport Rules promulgated by the Ministry: "Railway fares must be paid in advance in cash. Checks, drafts, promissory notes, etc. will not be accepted unless prior contact has been made with the Railway Bureau." Based on the above regulations, the Railway Bureau has telegraphed all stations along the line to politely explain to passengers who use promissory notes to purchase tickets and ask them to purchase tickets with cash.

### Dismissed Torpedo Depot Staff Member Suspected of Colluding to Steal Public Property, Case Returned for Retrial, Detained for Two Years Without Bail

[Our Report] Zhuang Yijiang, former lieutenant administrator of the Torpedo Depot of the Navy's First Supply Headquarters, was dismissed after his superiors discovered that he had held a puppet position. On July 2, 1947, he was handed over to his successor, Chen Zaidao. At that time, the inventory was correct. However, Zhuang remained living in the depot and learned that Squad Leader Qian Wenzheng and his brother Zhuang Jinjiang intended to sell public property. Therefore, they colluded to steal 45 mine-sweeping ropes, 41 mine-sweeping tail ropes, 38 buoy ropes, 180 magnetic pole lowering ropes, 200 meters of mine-sweeping wire, and a box of pressure gauge testers. On August 4 of the same year, Chen cleaned the warehouse and found that a large number of items were missing. Subsequently, a box of the stolen pressure gauge testers was found at the home of Gu Huidong, a classmate of Zhuang living nearby. At that time, Zhuang and others had all fled. Gu, in order to avoid suspicion, tried to find Zhuang's whereabouts and ran into him in his hometown of Suzhou, so he reported to the police and he was arrested and sent to the Navy First Base Command for interrogation and sentenced to 12 years. Subsequently, the Naval Headquarters ordered the department to transfer him to the local court on the grounds that Zhuang's crime occurred after he was dismissed from office and exempted from military service. After investigation and prosecution, he was sentenced to five years imprisonment by the court on October 25 of last year. The defendant appealed and on December 24 of the same year, the High Court returned the case for retrial. Yesterday, the court reopened the trial, and Zhuang flatly denied the facts of the crime. Because other defendants, Gu Huidong, Qian Wenzheng, Zhuang Jinjiang, and Chen Zaidao, were not present, the trial was adjourned to a later date. The defendant's lawyer requested bail because Zhuang's crime has not yet been determined and he has been detained for two years. However, the court refused to grant bail on the grounds that the case involved the theft and sale of military public property, which was a serious matter, and promised to close the case as soon as possible.

### Rubbings of Han Dynasty Brick and Stone Portraits to be Exhibited Regularly at the Museum

[Our Report] The Municipal Museum of this city is scheduled to hold an exhibition of rubbings of Han Dynasty brick and stone portraits in the newly built Faculty of Arts and Sciences classroom of Tongji University at the end of North Sichuan Road, starting from May 20. The exhibition has been in preparation for a long time, and all the rubbings obtained from collectors have been mounted by the museum's technical department. However, due to the cramped museum building, there is no suitable place for display, so it has been postponed. Now, at the request of the National Tongji University, it will be held regularly.

### Convicted of Buying Stolen Goods, Acquitted on Appeal, Counter-suit for Conspiracy and False Accusation Concluded, Fists Fly Upon Leaving the Courtroom, Alerting Patrol Police to Chase and Arrest

[Our Report] Zhang Liyue from Siyang, in July 1948, purchased a batch of stolen goods from the Third Ordnance Depot for 60 million legal tender, including two gas masks, three water dragons, and one wire mesh, which were deposited at Li's residence at No. 10 Songdong Lane, Qipu Road. The incident was discovered by Wu Jingfu, a storekeeper at the depot, who reported it to the police and was arrested. The case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. On October 19, 1948, the court sentenced Zhang to two months imprisonment for the crime of knowingly buying stolen goods. Zhang appealed, and on February 22 of this year, the High Court reversed the verdict and acquitted him. Zhang then filed a complaint with the court accusing Wu and Wang Zhaoyun and Zhuo Xian of conspiring to falsely accuse him of buying stolen goods and of intimidation and extortion. According to the complaint, Wang and others falsely accused him of buying stolen goods to the North Station Police Station on August 26, 1948. The police station dispatched officers to search but found nothing. The next day, Wang and others went to Li's residence at Qipu Road and arrested Peng Xuehua, a worker, and illegally detained him in Jiangwan. On the 28th, they came to Zhang's house and threatened him, saying that 1 billion legal tender was needed to settle the case, otherwise he would be detained along with Peng. Zhang and others refused. On the 31st, Wang and others came again, intending to arrest Zhang. Fortunately, he was out. They forcibly dragged Zhang's wife, Luo Xiuzhen, out. Zhang's wife cried out, and Sun Jinhui, a passerby, stepped forward to intervene. Wang and others fled, and Zhuo slipped and was held by Sun, who called the police and transferred him to the North Station Police Station, where he was released on bail shortly thereafter. It can be seen that Wang and others used violence, threats, intimidation and fraud to obtain money. The evidence is conclusive. He requests a clear judgment. Yesterday, the court opened the trial. Zhang and his wife testified in great detail. Only Wang, one of the defendants, appeared in court. Wu and Zhuo did not attend. The trial was concluded and a judgment was announced on the 19th of this month. Unexpectedly, as soon as the two parties left the court, they started fighting outside the court. The bailiffs intervened. Wang immediately rode a bicycle and fled. Zhang and others chased after him, shouting loudly. The guard police outside the court were alerted and drove after him. A commotion broke out on North Zhejiang Road for a while.

### Shanghai Electric Construction Company (British) Decides on Salary Payment Method, Divided into Two Payments per Month

[Our Report] The workers of the Shanghai Electric Construction Company (British) requested to borrow wages in advance, following the precedents of the other five major public utility companies.

Under the personal mediation of Shen Lu, Director of the Labor Section of the bureau, it was decided to change the salary payment dates of the 7th, 17th, and 18th of each month to the 5th and 20th of each month. The payment on the 5th is one-half of the half-month's salary from the 1st to the 15th, based on the index of the 30th of the previous month. The payment on the 20th is one-half of the half-month's salary from the 16th to the 30th, based on the index of the 15th, and the shortfall in the first half of the month is supplemented according to the index of the 15th. On May 5th, in addition to the payment of one-half of the half-month's salary, the shortfall in the second half of April will be supplemented according to the index of April 30th. This will be continued in this manner. The company has agreed, and due to the fact that the payment date for the first half of April has passed, each employee will first advance 200,000 yuan before the 15th, and this method will begin to be implemented from the 20th of this month.

### Industrial Association Cables for Tax Exemption on Raw Materials Imported for Export Products

The Municipal Industrial Association believes that recently, industrial products exported from our country, such as textiles, thermos bottles, enamelware, rubber products, aluminum products, umbrellas, needles, and nails, are exported in considerable quantities. However, the raw materials are mostly dependent on imports, and the imported raw materials are already expensive. In addition, shipping costs are controlled by others and are not easy to reduce, so the cost is higher and the price of finished products must also increase, resulting in difficulties in export. They have no place in the European and American markets, and even sales in Southeast Asia are threatened. The tariff preference is our right, and the government can exempt or refund taxes to encourage exports. For this reason, the association has cabled the relevant departments, ministries, and commissions, requesting that all foreign raw materials used for imported be completely tax-exempt, or that taxes be refunded when finished products are exported, in order to reduce costs and compete in the international market.

### Youth Imposes as Colonel Director, Gang Plunders Property of French Residents

Two Police Stations Arrest Four Criminals

[Our Report] Yin Jie, a local, 25 years old, living upstairs at the Fuxing Noodle Restaurant at 490 Madang Road, recently impersonated a colonel director of the Shanghai Office of the Nanjing China Times of the Political Work Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, and was engaged in swindling and deceiving. On the morning of the 9th of this month, he colluded with Yu Peng, Xie Min, Cao Jinde, and others to intimidate the French resident Tao Erdong at No. 51 Nanchang Road, accusing Tao of secretly hiding military weapons, and took the opportunity to rob him of 1,000 US dollars, a camera, and a clock before escaping without a trace. Afterwards, Tao reported the incident to the police station and requested an investigation. The Songshan Police Station received the report and immediately dispatched Song Tingjun, chief of the branch, along with judicial section chief Zhong He, and staff members Tan Delin and Fan Lewu to investigate. They finally arrested Yin at dawn the day before yesterday and seized a pistol, two bullets, and the original stolen camera and clock, as well as 19 silver dollars. At the same time, the Lujiawan Police Station also arrested the three criminals, Yu Peng and others, at the Shi Mao Hotel.

### Dada Ship Arrives from Ningbo, Passenger Arrested for Transporting Drugs

[Our Report] The Maritime Unified Inspection Post of the Garrison Command cracked a drug trafficking case yesterday. At approximately 8:00 AM yesterday morning, when the Dada Ship arrived at the city's dock from Ningbo, Chief Wang Hongjun led inspection personnel Wu Zhenzhong, Jin Hui, and Fan Guanghan to inspect passengers and found that Zhang Azhuang, a native of Ningbo, was acting suspiciously.

Zhang Azhuang and the seized opium were immediately escorted to the Maritime Unified Inspection Post for interrogation.

### Large Batch of Smuggled Goods Seized Outside Wusong Breakwater, British Navy Oil Tanker Protects Smuggling, Our Customs Lodge Serious Protest

[Central News Agency] The Jianghai Customs recently cracked a large-scale smuggling incident using a foreign military vessel. The case is serious. On the morning of the 11th of this month, the British Navy oil supply ship "Green Laurel Bridge" arrived at the port and anchored outside the Wusong Breakwater. In the distance, customs officers were closely watching from the Wusong Branch Customs observation post with binoculars, and deployed on land and water to intercept smuggled ships and vehicles at any time. At 4:30 PM, they glimpsed four civilian boats leaving the oil tanker and immediately dispatched customs launches to pursue them. When the civilian boats saw the customs launches, they fled in different directions, trying to reach the shoals. The customs officers risked danger to pursue them and eventually captured all of them. One boat was full of smuggled goods, totaling 82 pieces, mostly wool, saccharin, and radios. The other three boats were loaded with escorts and coolies. According to the confessions of smugglers Xie Shutang and Yan Baosun, this was an organized smuggling operation. They loaded the goods in Hong Kong onto a warship, and Xie Shutang escorted them on the ship. Yan Baosun took a plane to Shanghai to prepare for civilian boats and cars to pick them up. The arrangements were extremely meticulous. If the customs officers had not been alert and loyal, it would have been difficult to solve the case. The smuggled goods have now been escorted to the customs office for counting, and the smugglers will be transferred to the court for handling. It is shocking that the British Navy would use a supply ship to cover smuggling. It is learned that the Jianghai Customs has lodged a serious protest.

### P'u-tung Nearly Becomes a Den of Thieves: More Than Ten Men and Women Arrested in Two Operations

[Report from Our Newspaper] On the afternoon of the eleventh, around 3 p.m., the First Squadron of the Yangjing District Auxiliary Police received a tip that a large number of bandits were hiding in the district, plotting a robbery. The squadron's Deputy Commander, Zhang Haigen, ordered the Fifth Platoon Leader, Yang Lijing, and the Sixth Platoon Leader, Gong Shijia, to quickly investigate and make arrests. The two platoon leaders swiftly identified the bandits' hideout using rapid investigation methods. Around 10 p.m. that evening, they led squad leaders Zhu Jianliang and Yang Shiliang, along with officers Ben Zhipeng, Zhang Genquan, and more than ten others, and went with the head of the "bao" system to No. 479, Yu Family Temple. They found five or six male and female bandits sleeping together on one bed. When the officers broke down the door, the bandits were alerted and immediately opened fire to resist arrest. Fortunately, the officers were alert and swiftly knocked down the bandit who opened fire in the dark, seizing the firearm. The remaining bandits surrendered. They then found another handgun and four bullets. The arrested bandits included Tian Changcai from Haizhou, Wu Sanxiao and Wu Zhu-shi from Taizhou, Xia Mingfu, and Chu Guanyuan, a total of six people. They were immediately handed over to the Yangjing Sub-bureau. Subsequently, another bandit revealed that the firearms and ammunition were supplied by a soldier named Zhou Zhenwu from "Eighteen Rooms." Based on this lead, the sub-bureau rushed to arrest Zhou at 3 a.m. Upon interrogation, Zhou confessed that he did not have a military identity but had committed crimes more than once. The Yangjing Sub-bureau is currently conducting further investigations.

Another report: Around 8 p.m. on the same afternoon, the Zhabei Police Sub-bureau, after discovering that bandits Zhao Haigen and others were hiding in Yangjiazhai in Pudong, ordered Section Chief Jiang Ying to instruct Patrol Officer Wang Shusheng to lead officers to Pudong to make arrests. They also requested assistance from the Yangjing Sub-bureau. However, due to insufficient personnel, Auxiliary Police Commander Zhang Haigen ordered the First Squadron, attached with Yu Jialiang, to lead more than ten officers to assist in the operation. They divided into groups to conduct a search and arrested a notorious bandit, Zhao Haigen, at No. 39, Lane 53, Yangjiazhai. They continued to Shenjialong South End and arrested Mao, an accomplice. They continued to arrest Yang Xigen and two Zhu surname thieves near Qianjiaxiang, and seized two fake handguns and a batch of stolen goods.

### Both Railways Automatically Adjust Freight Rates: Minister of Communications Personally Orders Railway Bureau to Stop: Promises to Discuss a Thorough Solution with Both Houses of Parliament: May Still Adjust Three Times Monthly According to a Standard Formula

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Administration originally planned to automatically adjust passenger and freight rates starting today. Yesterday morning, Minister of Communications, Duanmu, personally called the directors of both railway bureaus, Wang Zhaohuai, and ordered them to stop the automatic price increases. However, he expressed deep sympathy for the current economic difficulties and the significant disparity between income and expenditure of the two railways. He promised to discuss a thorough solution with the Legislative Yuan and the Executive Yuan, potentially restoring the formulaic adjustment method of three times a month. Therefore, passenger fares on both railways will remain at the original price today. A spokesperson for the bureau told reporters that with such rampant inflation, maintaining fixed railway fares and adjusting them periodically would make it impossible to survive. The 7 billion yuan subsidy from the Ministry of Communications to both railways in April was received yesterday, but even after using it to repay the Central Bank, there was still a shortage of 1.380 tons of coal payment. (According to the loan borrowed from the Central Bank to purchase coal, the settlement is based on the coal price of the day). Currently, the coal reserves of the two railways in Nanjing can last until the 24th of this month, and those in Shanghai until the 15th. All other major stations will last until the 16th. It is expected that they will have to go to the Central Bank to borrow coal again in the next few days. The old debts are not cleared, and new debts are added. If this continues, the debt will become increasingly insurmountable, and all the assets of the two railways will be insufficient to cover it. The salaries owed to employees for March were only paid off yesterday, and the salaries for April are likely to be delayed until May.

Possible New Fare Implementation on the 15th

The Guangdong-Hankou Railway has already adjusted its fares from the 4th of this month, setting the passenger fare for third-class at one silver dollar per kilometer, and for express trains at 1.2 cents, which is twelve times higher than that of the two railways. The new fare planned by the two railways for implementation on the 13th has become inapplicable due to the soaring prices in the past three days. The Ministry of Communications has now agreed to consider a thorough solution, which the employees of the two railways and those concerned about the traffic of the two railways are welcoming. However, the economic difficulties of the two railways have reached a critical point and urgently need to be resolved. Therefore, the new fare may be implemented on the 15th of this month.

### Case of the Sunken "Yugang" Vessel Due to Disrepair: Chief Captain and Others Indicted

[Report from Our Newspaper] The "Yugang" vessel of the Fisheries Administration, which was overdue for repairs, sank due to a typhoon, causing multiple deaths and injuries. The case has been concluded after repeated investigations by the District Prosecutor's Office. The chief captain of the vessel, Si Songxin, the deputy chief captain, Liu Lianghan, and the head of the Maritime Affairs Section of the administration and concurrently the Business Section Chief of the Chief Captain's Office, Chen Shuyi, have been indicted on charges of causing death by negligence. It is reported that the "Yugang" vessel was inspected by personnel from the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications on July 9th of last year, and the certificate issued had a validity period of three months, which was due to expire on October 8th of last year. When it went out to sea on October 11th, the captain of the vessel, Wang Jingsheng, went to Qingdao on official business, and Kan Zhaoyuan acted as captain in his place. On the 15th of the same month, the vessel collided with the "Yuxin" vessel in Shenjiamen, Zhejiang, and the bow was damaged. They hired carpenters locally to repair it, but the ship continued to leak. The crew members of the vessel believed that continuing to go out to sea would be dangerous, so they telegraphed Si and Liu for instructions. Si and Liu, upon receiving the report, ordered them to continue to go out to sea. On the 25th of the same month, the vessel returned to Shanghai. After inspection by Wang Yebo, the foreman of the carpentry team at the Ship Repair Factory of the Post-War Rehabilitation Committee, it was confirmed that the vessel had cracks below the waterline and was leaking water, and needed to be repaired in the shipyard. Si and Liu believed that the profits from going out to sea were very high and did not want to stop. When the original captain Wang Jingsheng returned to Shanghai from Qingdao after completing his official duties, he requested major repairs, but they did not allow it and ordered Wang to lead the crew to continue going out to sea. As a result, the vessel sank in the northeast sea of Nanfei Mountain in Xiangshan County, Zhejiang Province (i.e., 122 degrees 45 minutes east longitude and 28 degrees 50 minutes north latitude) at noon on December 14th due to a typhoon. All personnel on board, including Captain Wang Jingsheng, Deputy Captain Zhu Zijun, Chief Engineer Huang Hang, Second Officer Xin Yebin, Fishing Foreman Jiang Guoliang, Fisherman Gao Tongde, fishermen Jiang Axiang, Jiang Ruyun, Wu Xuecheng, Shen Laizhang, Wu Kunxing, and intern Shi, were drowned. Later, after learning of the incident, the administration sent a ship to rescue them and only recovered the body of Jiang Axiang, which was transported to Shanghai. The families of the victims suspected that Zhao Junmai, the director of the administration, Wang Yikang, the deputy director, and Si, Liu, and Chen had committed crimes, so they jointly filed a petition for investigation.

### Several Industries, Including Hardware and Toothbrushes, Refuse to Collect Security Donations on Behalf: Authorities Urge Prompt Payment

In order to subsidize the food expenses of the garrison troops, Mayor Wu began collecting local security donations at the beginning of last month. Since the collection began, the donation situation of various important industrial and commercial sectors in the city has been quite enthusiastic. However, up to now, the Local Security Donation Committee has found that industries such as hardware, toothbrush, cigar, machinery, beer trade, insurance trade, securities trade, and real estate trade have not yet donated. Yesterday, the municipal government ordered the Social Affairs Bureau and the Police Bureau to conduct thorough inquiries and urge them to do so. Because it concerns local safety, it is necessary to order them to pay promptly. In addition, the committee has also compiled a list of members of the industries that have already begun collecting donations who refuse to comply and has requested the Social Affairs and Police Bureaus to conduct inquiries and urge them to do so. Those who fail to pay the donation within the deadline will be subject to an additional "late fee" as a penalty, as stipulated: (1) Within five days of the deadline, an additional 20% of the donation amount will be charged. (2) Within ten days of the deadline, an additional 50% will be charged. (3) Within fifteen days of the deadline, an additional 150% will be charged. (4) Those who fail to pay within fifteen days will be reported to higher authorities for severe punishment.

The next highest were Huangpu, Hongkou, Xincheng, Songshan, French Concession, and Zhenru. No records were found for Gaoqiao.

### All Jiangsu Power Plants Face Closure: Seeking Emergency Loans from the National Bank

Since coal and oil prices have been dynamically adjusted according to the exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar, power plants in Jiangsu Province have faced significant threats. Moreover, due to price fluctuations, coal prices and electricity prices are often out of sync. In addition, due to factors such as the forced use of current, they have suffered heavy losses and are on the verge of closure. Yesterday, the Jiangsu Electrical Industry Association held an emergency meeting in Shanghai, gathering members from companies across the province to discuss several important proposals. In the afternoon, they invited Speaker Pang Shusen of the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly to visit President Liu of the Central Bank to request an emergency loan for one month's fuel for the power plants in Jiangsu to facilitate turnover. Secretary-General Lin Chongyong of the Loan Committee of the National Bank received them. After Speaker Pang and the representatives expressed the severity of the situation, Secretary-General Lin promised to submit it to the Loan Committee for review immediately.

### Municipal Government Promises to Allocate 500 Million for Repairs of Damage to City Schools by Garrison Troops: Secretary-General Chen States Funds to Be Issued Within One Month

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since garrison troops have been stationed in some municipal primary and secondary schools in the city, the school buildings and equipment have inevitably suffered some damage. Mayor Wu previously verbally expressed to the principals of various schools that he would allocate temporary funds to subsidize the schools for repairs. Yesterday morning, Municipal Government Secretary-General Chen summoned Education Bureau Chief Secretary Zheng, Secondary Education Section Chief Ye, National Education Section Chief Lu, and principals of municipal primary and secondary schools, Zhou Feicheng, Hu Shuyi, and Long Xia, to discuss the matter. Originally, the reported losses from various schools were very large, exceeding 1 billion yuan. Secretary-General Chen reduced it to 500 million yuan and issued an order to Chief Secretary Zheng, stating: "The following matters should be noted for the repair of school buildings in various municipal vocational primary and secondary schools: (1) The allocation of 500 million yuan for repair expenses should be fair and reasonable. (2) Funds should be issued immediately upon arrival, and repairs should be carried out immediately upon receipt. (3) Each school should mobilize teachers and students for labor service, making one cent worth several cents. (4) Prevent waste, misappropriation, and all kinds of malpractices." Secretary-General Chen also stated that the funds would be issued within one month. Afterwards, the Education Bureau and various schools will discuss the allocation method, with the principle determined as: (1) Municipal vocational middle schools will receive 250 million yuan. (2) Municipal primary schools will receive 250 million yuan. The amount received by each school will depend on the extent of the damage.

### Political Case Cracked in Wuxi and Yixing Counties: Those Arrested Include County Magistrate, Section Chief, Deputy Section Chief, and Others: Related to the "Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance" Organization

[Report from Our Newspaper in Wuxi on the 11th] Recently, a major political case has been cracked here. Those arrested include Fan Taisheng, the first Wuxi County Magistrate after the victory, Zhu Datong, the former Tongshan County Magistrate, Zhang Yifei, the current Social Section Chief of the Wuxi County Government, and Peng Fuzhong, the former Deputy Section Chief of the Wuxi County Land and Food Section, and others. It is said that the case is related to the "Sun Yat-senism Revolutionary Alliance" organization. The leader is Xu Wentian, the former Director of Education of the Jiangsu Provincial Cadre Training Corps and the current Legislator. Fan and others have now been sent to Zhenjiang for trial.

Authorities Secretly Ordered Escort to Zhenjiang

At 2 a.m. on the 5th of this month, County Magistrate Li Zi suddenly received a secret order from the Provincial Security Headquarters to detain Social Section Chief Zhang Yifei. Li, who also served as the City Defense Commander, immediately summoned Team Leader Guo of the Investigation Team after receiving the order and gave him instructions in person. That afternoon, Guo sent personnel to invite Zhang to the City Defense Department and detained him. On the same morning, Team Leader Guo also personally visited the mansion of former County Magistrate Fan in Houxixi. Fan was out, so Guo rushed to the Xinchang Yarn Company operated by Fan. After meeting, he invited him to have lunch at the City Defense Department. Deputy Commander Li Tiqing then pulled out an arrest warrant and said: "We are old friends, but today there is an official matter that is difficult for my brother." Afterwards, Section Chief Zhang and former County Magistrate Fan were sent to Zhenjiang on the 2 o'clock train.

Three Searches Yielded Documents

Zhang Da, the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Police and Security Department, is the person in charge of handling this case. He came to Wuxi at 11 a.m. on the 5th, under the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters. After getting off the train, he went directly to the County Police Bureau and secretly discussed with Director Miao. Then, he issued an order and gathered a large number of patrol officers, patrol sergeants, and criminal police officers to prepare for action. At that time, the atmosphere inside the bureau was extremely tense. The work was not completed until 11 p.m. that night. In addition to Fan and the other four, those arrested included Xu Shaosheng, the younger brother of Xu Wentian, and Huang Keqin (engaged in silk cocoons, recently returned from Xuzhou), Ding Yaping, and others. On the same day, the enforcement personnel searched Section Chief Zhang's residence three times and inspected the residences of other people, reportedly finding many books and other printed materials.

Extensive Involvement: First Crackdown in Yixing

On the 31st of last month, the provincial authorities similarly sent people to Yixing to arrest Zhou Daoxin, a member of the local council and teacher at the Provincial Agricultural School, Wu Chucai, the former Chief Secretary of the Yixing County Government, Zhu Yaohan, the head of general affairs of the Yixing County Bank, and others. After Zhou and others were sent to Zhenjiang, the arrests and searches in Wuxi occurred. There are widespread rumors that Zhang Yifei was transferred to Shanghai for interrogation, but the truth remains to be verified.

### The Battle for the Anqing Bridgehead

— Our Correspondent Liu Zao

[Report from Our Newspaper in Anqing on the 10th] The commanders in charge of the Anqing campaign are Xia Wei, Commander of the Eighth Pacification Zone, Xu Qiming, Deputy Commander, Zhuge Shu, Chief of Staff, Tan Heyi, Corps Commander, and Wu Zhongjian, the division commander of the defending forces. If we link and extrapolate the names of General Xia Wei and others, we can develop an interesting character analysis that cleverly shows that the National Army has a promising future in the battle of Anqing.

"The might of Xia Yang" has long caused the Communists to fear and be alarmed. This time, the chief of staff of the National Army is a "Mr. Zhuge." He can borrow the east wind and, under "the dawn's light," gradually give people "enlightenment; the future is bright." The Anqing defending forces are the mainstay and will definitely defend firmly." Therefore, the Communists want to seize this bridgehead, and "it is not easy to speak of taking it."

— Episode of the Anqing Campaign—

After the end of the Huaihai Campaign, the Communists' attack target had already indicated Anqing in the Jiangbei bridgehead. Because in terms of terrain, it is the barrier of Nanjing and the left arm of Wuhan. In terms of the situation before the campaign, the defending forces command structure at that time—the Eighth Pacification Zone—was being adjusted and replaced, and it took advantage of the opportunity to descend, hoping to take Anqing in one fell swoop, seize this bridgehead in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, and use it as a future crossing point.

The Communist forces facing them have two corps. Its operational boundary is bounded by Baitu Lake, Caizi Lake, Tongcheng Lake, and Zongyang to the north of Anqing. Chen Yi is to the east, and Liu Bocheng is to the west. Liu Bocheng's 15th Corps, with its 43rd and 44th divisions in Taihu and the 45th division in Susong, and the 11th Corps, with its 31st, 32nd, and 33rd divisions, an independent division, the Western Anhui Backbone Brigade, and three backbone regiments, are responsible for the main attack on the front of Anqing. According to military estimates, the Communist forces on the front have 50,000 people. Although they have suffered nearly 20,000 casualties in the fighting in the past ten days, their strength seems to be constantly maintained at this number.

The Anqing defending forces, Wu Zhongjian's troops, were a team that had just been supplemented by a reserve brigade transferred from the rear during the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign. To say that new soldiers who had been trained for less than half a year in Guangxi would immediately assume this difficult task is indeed not easy.

Corps Commander Tan Heyi talked about the 17 days of the Anqing bridgehead defense battle yesterday. He said: "This battle can be divided into three phases at present:"

"The first phase: The battle near Sishilipu and Lion Mountain is a skirmish. At noon on March 21st, a part of the Communist Independent Division of more than 800 people and the main force of the Western Anhui Independent Brigade of more than 2,000 people attacked the National Army guards near Sishilipu and Lion Mountain (both about 20 kilometers north of Anqing). The fighting lasted until the morning of the 22nd. The defending troops, believing that the guard mission had been achieved, gradually withdrew to the first line of resistance near Jixianguan."

"The second phase: Near Jixianguan, on March 22nd, the 31st Division of the Communist 11th Corps and the Independent Division and the Western Anhui Independent Brigade all arrived on the battlefield one after another and launched an attack on the first line of resistance of the National Army at Jixianguan. By the 24th, Jixianguan was lost and regained, forming a seesaw situation. In order to obtain a favorable situation, reduce the front and concentrate forces, and continue to complete the mission, the National Army took the initiative to transfer to the second line of resistance on the night of the 24th and deployed a line that matched the existing forces of the defending army and was ideal for defense. Because the limited forces led by Division Commander Wu Zhongjian were not easy to take on the broad front of the defense and would only increase their own casualties under the other side's tactic of eating the small with the large."

"The third phase: On the line of Qipanshan, Wulidun, and Zhangmuchong on the outskirts of Anqing, which is the second line of resistance in the current stage, the Communist army continued to press forward while the defending army adjusted and occupied the second line of resistance. Its two subsequent divisions of the 11th Corps—the 32nd and 33rd divisions—and three backbone regiments and an artillery regiment also arrived on the 25th to reinforce, and launched a fierce attack on the National Army positions with its several times superiority, especially in the Qipanshan farm area on the eastern outskirts of the city. The battle situation day and night from the 24th to the 4th of April:"

"From the night of the 24th to the night of the 27th, there was fierce fighting on the entire line day and night. The defending army resisted bravely, and the Communist army did not succeed."

"On the 30th, the daytime was slightly calm. After the curtain fell, a fierce attack was launched on the entire line until the night of the 31st. The offensive was still fierce. During that period, the two strongholds of Qipanshan and the farm were once lost, but were quickly recovered by the defending army's counterattack."

"On April 1st, the daytime was calm, and there was an artillery battle at dusk, lasting for two hours. It was followed by a fierce attack on the entire line, with assaults reaching more than ten times, all of which failed."

"On April 4th, the Communist army continued to dig trenches and attacked again, but failed. The National Army launched a powerful attack to the east and occupied Taihu Dam and the line 2,000 meters east of it. In that short day, the attacking Communist army suffered more than 2,000 casualties, and more than 110 people were captured. Its trench warfare tactics were completely shattered."

"The battle for the Anqing bridgehead began on March 21st and lasted for a full 17 days until April 6th. Compared to the 17 days of the Battle of Hengyang, which was famous both at home and abroad during the War of Resistance, and the five days of the wonderful Second Battle of Changsha, it was three to four times more of a hard fight."

"This battle of Anqing can be said to be the most wonderful battle."

Anqing Defending General and Division Commander Wu Zhongjian (Report from Our Correspondent Liu Zao)

### Repairing the Jinwu Light Railway

— Our Reporter Jiang Feng

[Our Jinhua Dispatch, 4th] The Jinwu Railway, this short 50-kilometer route, is a history of blood and tears.

In the early summer of the 31st year (1942), the enemy launched a major offensive on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, attempting to open up the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and realize their dream of a "East Asian Continental Corridor." Jinhua, Wuyi, and other places fell into enemy hands during that offensive. At that time, the enemy learned that Jinhua, Wuyi, and other places were rich in fluorite. They dispatched experts to conduct detailed investigations, believing that the Wuyi fluorite mine had abundant reserves and excellent quality. Therefore, they forcibly recruited laborers to build the Jinwu Light Railway. The people near Jinhua completed the earthwork of the Jinwu Line under the lash. In less than half a year, the Jinwu Railway was opened to traffic amid the painful feelings of the Chinese people. After the opening of the railway, the enemy did everything possible to plunder the Wuyi fluorite until the eve of their defeat. In the spring of the 34th year (1945), when the enemy planned to withdraw from Jinhua, they dismantled the steel rails and bridge materials of the Jinwu Line and transported them elsewhere, leaving only a roadbed, which is now dilapidated.

The products along this route are quite numerous, especially fluorite. It is estimated that 400 tons can be produced daily for up to 50 years. Not long ago, a German geological and metallurgical expert was invited by the American Jiangnan Company to investigate and believed that the Wuyi fluorite was of pure quality and large quantity, and was considered one of the largest fluorite mines in the world. It is estimated that each ton can obtain a net profit of US$7-8, and 5-6,000 tons can be sold each month, which is very economical to export in exchange for foreign exchange. According to reliable investigations, Wuyi County exports more than 80,000 tons of agricultural products, 350,000 tons of bamboo paper and grass paper, and imports about 20,000 tons of cotton textiles each year. It is estimated that the daily freight volume will be 1,300 tons after the restoration of traffic in the future. In addition, coal is produced in the northeastern suburbs of the county, 2 to 5 kilometers from the city, and iron sand is produced in the towns of Censhang, Wuxi, and Qingxi, 20 kilometers from the city, which may also be mined on a large scale in the future.

Because the Jinwu branch line has great economic value, when Shen Chengzhang was in charge of Zhejiang, he had a plan to repair the road as a section of the Hangzhou-Wenzhou Railway. Later, due to the problem of raising road funds and the fact that Shen Chengzhang was transferred to another position, the plan was once shelved. After Chen Gongqia took over from Shen, he announced a major plan to repair the Jinwu Railway, mine Wuyi fluorite in exchange for railway equipment, and build a light rail network in the province. After Chen Ren, Director of the Construction Department, Gong Peicheng, ran around to make contact, it seemed that everything was arranged, and it was originally possible to start construction before the end of last year.

However, not long after, the war situation changed, and the evacuation of Beijing and Shanghai was raised, and the construction of the Jinwu branch line was shelved again. Until recently, Zhou Yan took charge of Zhejiang, and the old matter was brought up again, and a "Light Railway Construction Plan" was drawn up. Under the principle of "seeking its通(tōng - accessibility) first, and then seeking its 備(bèi - completeness)", mountain traffic was developed and minerals were transported. It is planned to sell the fluorite produced in the province to foreign countries, exchange it for foreign exchange to purchase necessary materials, and use civilian labor to repair it.

The implementation procedure has been decided. The following three lines will be built first this year:

(1) The Jin(hua)-Wu(yi) line, 50 kilometers long, is to facilitate the transportation of Wuyi fluorite.

(2) The Shang(jiaodao)-Jin(yun) section of the Jin(hua)-Wen(zhou) line, about 60 kilometers long. Surveying work is now being prepared. Construction can be started after Wuyi fluorite is exchanged for steel rails from foreign countries.

(3) The Yong(bo)-Bai(duan) section of the Hangzhou-Ningbo line can be built after the Japanese steel rails are transported.

From the above plan, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has decided to include the Jinwu Line in the first phase of the construction project, and it is expected that construction will start soon.

As early as when Chen Gongqia was in charge of Zhejiang, the Zhejiang Provincial Light Railway Preparatory Office was established, and Luo Jigang, a senior engineer transferred from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, was appointed as the director of the Preparatory Office. Then, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway also established the Jinwu Branch Line Preparatory Office in Jinhua on New Year's Day this year, and Luo Jigang was still appointed as the director, and Chen Changyan was additionally appointed as the senior engineer and deputy director to actively prepare for the start of construction.

On January 22 this year, Director Luo and Zeng Ziwei, director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Finance, came to Jinhua to convene a symposium of the county magistrates and public representatives of Jinhua, Wuyi, Lanxi, Tangxi, Suichang, Longyou, and Qu County to discuss the construction of the Jinwu Line. It was decided on the spot that the counties along the Jinwu Line would be responsible for requisitioning 35,000 insufficient sleepers. The market price of each sleeper was equivalent to 24 catties of Zhongbai rice. The province would bear half of the cost, and the counties present would jointly bear half of the cost. The number of sleepers purchased by each county would be determined by the province based on the tax quota and business tax amount of each county, and it was stipulated that all of them should be requisitioned within March.

In addition to the smooth resolution of the sleeper problem, the three large bridges along the line, namely the Jinhua River, which is 160 meters long, the Baxian River, which is 130 meters long, and the Baiyang River, which is 160 meters long, have a total length of 550 meters across the area. The bridge steel beams required for the project were requested by the Preparatory Office to be transferred from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) materials allocated to the Jinpu Railway and still stored in the Zhanghuabang Bridge Yard in Shanghai, and it is said that there is no problem in principle. In addition, locomotives have been planned to be purchased by Tang Enbo, and passenger and freight vehicles have been allocated by the Ministry of Communications. It has been decided to borrow the existing steel rails stored in Shanghai on the Huainan Road, and it is possible that all of them will be transported here for use within a month.

The surveying team dispatched for the 1/2000 scale plan and the 1/4000 scale longitudinal profile started work on the 18th of last month and will be able to survey to the suburbs of Wuyi today. When this reporter visited the Wuyi fluorite mine, I saw staff responsible for surveying working in the rain on the way. It has been raining heavily for the past half month, but the more than 20 staff members are working in extremely difficult conditions and may complete the task in a very short time. Their good working morale is truly admirable in today's situation.

From all aspects, the preparatory work for the restoration project of the Jinwu Light Railway has been largely completed, and it has entered the state of "everything is ready, only欠(qiàn - lacking)東風(dōngfēng - east wind)". The people along the Jinwu Line are looking forward to the government authorities quickly allocating the funds for the project as the "east wind", so that this Jinwu Line, which has been paid for by the people with blood and enslaved by the enemy, can become an artery serving the people and promoting the rural economy as soon as possible. The reporter wishes it an early resurrection!

(29) Zheng Yu Bao Mountain: 12 li from the city, 8 li to Shuikou. There are two ore veins, the surrounding rock is rhyolite, the reserves are about 5,500 tons, with very good quality.

(30) Dian Hou Long: 12 li from the city, 8 li to Shuikou. The south vein is 1.5 meters wide, the outcrop is 30 meters long, the north vein is 6 inches wide, the outcrop is 30 meters long, the surrounding rock is rhyolite. The reserves are about 10,000 tons, with very good quality.

(31) Nei Wai Si Mu: 12 li from the city, 8 li to Shuikou. It is the south vein of Dian Hou Long, 1.5 meters wide, the outcrop is 20 meters long, and the reserves are about 6,000 tons.

From the above investigation data, it can be seen that Wuyi's ore reserves are vast and abundant. Therefore, during the enemy's operation, a large-scale fluorite smelting plant covering an area of 35 mu was built outside the south gate of Wuyi, all made of steel and cement, with facilities such as a water storage pool and a water tower, and there was a hydroelectric power plant nearby. In the mining areas such as Jiang Wan Dong, more than 40 worker residences and a small power plant were built. There are light rail networks in each mine. This reporter made a special trip to visit the Wuyi mining area. Except for the bridge steel rails and sleepers of the Jinwu Light Railway, which were dismantled and transported away by the enemy before the victory, the mining areas that only left the roadbed earthwork were also mostly damaged, and the mining tunnels were covered by collapsed waste rocks; the worker residences were also dilapidated. The fluorite smelting plant in the south of the city only has a large chimney standing tall into the clouds, sighing to the long sky, for people to commemorate.

Three years after the victory, time has passed in the civil war. The enemy left behind a roughly scaled mine, but there was no time and no ability to recover it, and it was allowed to be buried, which is truly regrettable. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Government has repeatedly advocated restoring the Jinwu Railway, reopening Wuyi fluorite, and prohibiting private mining and transportation; however, the government has been planning for a long time and has not yet reached the implementation stage. Therefore, private scattered miners have all stopped work due to an order prohibiting external transportation. After this reporter visited the mining area, I felt that Wuyi's fluorite is not only of good quality and large quantity, but also has convenient transportation, and it is urgent to recover it. Here, I sincerely hope that the government authorities will quickly lay the Jinwu Railway, and the government and businesses will jointly establish a mining company to purchase machinery and engage in large-scale mining. This is not only related to the prosperity and decline of the rural economy in central Zhejiang, but also to the national economy and people's livelihood.

### The Process of Xue Daxiong, a Student of the Chinese Department of Chongqing University, Discovering the Han Tomb

[Our Dispatch from Chongqing, 9th] An ancient Han tomb was discovered this morning near the Nongzhuang, the dormitory of the faculty and staff of Chongqing University. It has been confirmed by Professor Qin Fengxiang and Shao Zuping of the Chinese Department. The discovery of the ancient tomb was extremely accidental. Xue Daxiong, a student of the Chinese Department of Chongqing University, is originally from Wujin, Jiangsu. Recently, because an ancient tomb was discovered in his hometown, and someone sent a letter to inform him of the patterns of the Han bricks unearthed, this curious student had a flash of inspiration. He cleverly said that Han bricks had also been discovered near Chongqing University. Sure enough, this morning, he dug up fragments of pottery of bodhisattvas, leopards, dragons, provinces, cups and plates in the Nongzhuang. In addition, he also discovered Han bricks of 4.5 inches in length and width, and 8 inches in height. There were burr-shaped patterns on both sides of the bricks, which were the same as the patterns of the Han bricks sent from Wujin. This matter has caused a sensation in Shapingba. Xue Daxiong is consulting with Yuan Shifu, the director of the Chinese Department, to preside over the excavation of the Han tomb in the future.

### Speculation on the Flour Market in Changzhou Three Companies Embarrassed by Squeeze

[Our Dispatch from Wujin, 11th] On Friday and Saturday of last week, the price of goods soared, and speculators repeatedly pushed up the price, causing unprecedented chaos in the market. In the flour market, Pingqi, who was accustomed to shorting, Zhenfeng Flour Shop, Zhang Jingwen, Hengfeng Shop, nicknamed Little Wang, and Wang Afang and others, shorted more than 5,000 bags of flour, taking away more than 600 million yuan in cash. Later, when their colleagues squeezed them for cash, they were unable to cope and all avoided the exchange and disappeared. On one hand, they tried to ask for a bankruptcy. On the 10th, the flour market stopped auctioning. The county government specially ordered the person in charge of the association to not open the auction before the floating amount was smoothed out, so as to avoid causing chaos.

### Visiting the Dragon Well Tea Region

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Chuyu Sheng

[Special Dispatch from Hangzhou, 10th of This Month] The Dragon Well tea leaves, famous both at home and abroad, are primarily produced in the scenic areas of Hangzhou: Lion Peak, Dragon Well, Yunqi, and Hupao. Among them, Lion Peak's production is considered the best, followed by Dragon Well, and then the others. Lion Peak is a high mountain next to Dragon Well and can be said to be part of the Dragon Well area, hence the tea is named after Dragon Well.

There are two routes to Dragon Well. One is via the Nine Creeks and Eighteen Streams, and the other is from Jingjiang Road in the North Mountain to the "Twin Peaks Piercing the Clouds" monument, turning left into a small path. This small path is also accessible by car, leading directly to the foot of Dragon Well Mountain. The Nine Creeks and Eighteen Streams, as well as the mountains near Dragon Well, are mostly barren hills, except for the vicinity of Dragon Well Temple, which still retains many ancient trees, resembling a peacock with its tail spread, proudly showing off to the surrounding mountains.

Climbing Dragon Well Mountain, winding stone steps are naturally arranged with clumps of green leaves and forests. There is also a pool of moderate size, with ancient vines winding around it. Gradually ascending, one reaches Dragon Well Temple. In the tea pavilion of Dragon Well Temple, one can overlook West Lake. Entering a rockery cave, there is a Dragon Well. Originally, this well is a mountain spring. After a fresh rain, a dividing line can be seen on the water surface. Even if stirred with a stick, it still exists. It is said that the mountain spring originally contains minerals, and the rainwater, after falling, cannot mix with the mountain spring, thus forming two halves. Once the rainwater flows away, the dividing line disappears.

The Shunzhi and Qianlong Emperors of the Qing Dynasty visited this place several times, staying for a day or two before returning to the city. This place is indeed peaceful and tranquil, perfect for escaping the summer heat, and is the most elegant area in the South Mountain. In the past, Hu Shih also came here and, seeing many ancient stone tablets used as paving stones, wrote an article regretting this. Now, some of them have been recovered by the temple monks, such as the well railing of Dragon Well. The rest have disappeared.

Walking a few hundred steps from Dragon Well Temple, a bamboo forest leads to Dragon Well Village. All 104 households in the village are engaged in tea cultivation. This village is built next to the Nine Creeks, and a small stream flows through the village into the Eighteen Streams. The houses near the water have small stone bridges, and inside each house, there is a stove for frying tea. In the open space in front of the houses, chickens and ducks are raised in flocks, but it is very clean. The villagers are neatly dressed, with clean faces, resembling a secluded paradise.

The surrounding mountains are planted with short tea bushes, and the towering Lion Peak looks as if the tea trees are planted like a chessboard.

I, as a reporter, have been in Hangzhou for almost three years, and have visited various scenic spots. However, the scenery around Dragon Well is the most superior. Whenever people come to Hangzhou to visit, I always recommend it as a good place to go. In the spring of 1947, Tian Han, Ying Yunwei, and Wu Tian came to Hangzhou and were inspired here to write the screenplay for the film "Remembering Jiangnan."

During the Qingming Festival, Dragon Well takes on a fresh new look. Men and women picking tea, carrying baskets on their backs, climb the tea mountains, picking tender tea buds. In Dragon Well Village, every household opens its doors, placing tables and chairs, with white tablecloths on the tables, displaying glass bottles containing tea leaves and several teacups. On the door, there is a sign that reads "This Household Sells Dragon Well Bud Tea," so that tourists can purchase it after enjoying the fine tea.

According to Yongchang, the abbot of Dragon Well Temple, Dragon Well has had tea for a long time. During the Song Dynasty, Su Dongpo often came to the temple (then named "Guangfu") and enjoyed tea and conversation with the old abbot Biancai. When Emperor Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty came to the temple, the villagers presented tea leaves to him. He praised it as a fine product and visited the area, where he saw eighteen tea trees, hence the saying "Eighteen Imperial Tea Trees." Before the war, Hu Shih, while serving as the envoy to the United States, annually entrusted a Mr. Cheng from Shanghai to purchase ten catties of Dragon Well tea from the temple for President Roosevelt. As a result, more and more foreigners came to buy it. I have visited tea farmers and learned that a mu of tea trees can produce forty to fifty catties of good tea, or one dan of lower quality tea. The tea fields also need to be fertilized and weeded, using fertilizers such as manure and rapeseed cake. During the Anti-Japanese War, because there was no fertilizer, many tea trees became old, so the recent production has decreased compared to before the war. Tea trees are best planted on mountains, especially sandy mountains. The areas near Lion Peak and Centipede Temple are the best because they are white sandy mountains. The eighteen imperial tea trees are located there.

After the tea leaves are picked, they must be stir-fried by hand, with a slow fire and a quick, hot fire under the stove. Stir-frying must be done several times to be considered successful. After stir-frying, some people also blend old tea, saying that blending with old tea enhances the aroma. This year, the monthly cost for providing food and lodging to stir-fryers is five dan of rice. The cost for pickers is about five hundred yuan per tael. Based on cost calculations, the selling price of pre-Qingming tea is about one dan of rice per catty. Last year, there were many tourists, and the production of Dragon Well tea, about five to six thousand dan, was not enough to sell. Some tea merchants used tea leaves from Lin'an, Yuhang, Shaoxing, and other places to replace Dragon Well tea for sale. Although the tea business in Dragon Well Village is very good, the atmosphere in Dragon Well Village is so tranquil and comfortable, most of the families in the village are poor because they lack capital during the tea-picking season and have to borrow from tea merchants. When the tea is produced, one catty is used to settle the debt for one catty. When the tea price is high, they cannot enjoy the profit and are busy for nothing. As for wanting to improve the tea fields and plant new tea, it is out of the question.

I always imagine that such famous Dragon Well tea should be further improved, such as maintaining its color, aroma, and taste permanently. However, because the tea-growing families are too busy taking care of their livelihoods, many agricultural experts with ambition have not yet turned their attention to Dragon Well tea.

This year, with the flames of war approaching, Dragon Well tea has suffered another blow!

### Foreign Exchange Arbitrage Transactions Sprout Up Like Bamboo Shoots After Rain; Silver Dollars Rise, Gold Notes Fade

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday's silver dollar arbitrage was particularly active due to the upcoming tea season. It is reported that more than ten firms arbitrated out large quantities of silver dollars for remittance, with the remittance rate rising to five yuan (an increase of 105 yuan for every 100 yuan). Some were done on a five-day term, with the counterparty paying cash, while others were done with drafts, with payment in two days. Most of these remittances were transferred to Tunxi, Wuyuan, and other places. Although the Hunanese firms arbitrated out sporadic remittances, totaling about 50,000 yuan, the exchange rate was an increase of two yuan per 100 yuan. Arbitrage in Wanxian saw an increase of one yuan per 100 yuan, with some done directly, possibly due to the high price of silver dollars in Wanxian. Hankou firms had silver dollar funds coming in, but no outgoing arbitrage was reported. Shanghai mostly used draft remittances, with payment three days after sight, and payment in gold yuan for delays of one day, but the amounts were small. Conversely, gold yuan being arbitraged in was quite common.

Nanchang rice firms arbitrated out a large amount of silver dollars, with an increase of one to three yuan per 100 yuan. In Peiping yesterday, it was heard that a certain large building Shen Zhuang firm arbitrated out 500 US dollars, with the remittance rate done directly. In Fuzhou, silver dollar arbitrage was done by the southern goods firms, with an exchange rate of 15 yuan per 100 yuan. It is difficult to accurately calculate the above statistics due to the scattered amounts, and each firm's arbitrage is in violation of the law, making it difficult to investigate the underlying reasons without special connections.

Furthermore, a Tianjin merchant told our reporter that the number of silver dollars arbitrated out by northern firms will continue to grow. It is heard that a certain influential person is planning to purchase a large quantity of Yuan heads (silver dollars) in Shanghai and Hangzhou and transport them to Tunxi for arbitrage remittance business. However, mountain villages price raw tea in silver dollars, making "Tianjin-Shanghai" and "Shanghai-Tunxi" silver dollar arbitrage a great business opportunity recently.

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, silver dollars once again showed their strength, having already surpassed gold and US dollars. The stock exchange, with its dealmaking firms, opened with one tael of gold exchanging for 48 big heads (silver dollars), and one tael of gold going out for 50 big heads. Trading then narrowed to 47-49, 46-48, and finally closed in the afternoon at 47-49. The afternoon saw a decline to 46-48, with closing at 45-47.

Small heads (silver dollars) remained stable, trading at 60-65. Dragon dollars fell steadily from 90-95 to 88-93, and then down to 87-92 in the afternoon. The ratio of big heads to small heads remained stable at 80 to 100, and the ratio of big heads to dragon and eagle dollars also remained at 60 to 100. The US dollar rose from ten yuan to eleven yuan.

[Report from This Newspaper] Street trading saw factories absorb supplies with all their might, and with mid-month approaching, demand from all parties was eager, and sentiment was bullish. Holders released little and absorbed more.

The morning remained stable, with big heads quoted at 70,000-73,000, rising all the way to 73,000-78,000, 75,000-80,000. Near noon, prices rose to 78,000-82,000, and then to 80,000-85,000 in the afternoon. Small heads were quoted at 65,000-70,000, and dragon and eagle dollars were quoted at 45,000-50,000. In promissory note trading, big heads were finally quoted at 85,000-90,000. Money exchange firms' dealmaking for big heads for the next day rose to 87,000-92,000, approaching the 90,000 mark, an increase of 10,000 from the previous day.

### National Bank Continued Selling Gold Yesterday; Off-Exchange Prices Briefly Surpassed 4 Million

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, after the Central Bank sold gold off-exchange at a price of 3.6 million yuan, and seeing that the market had little appetite, it, with lightning speed, around 10 o'clock, entrusted Dadecheng Gold Firm to sell unlimited amounts at the black market price of 3.6 million in the market, reducing prices all the way to 3.45 million, for a total of 11,976 bars.

According to the regulations, the allowed daily increase was 3,284,000, but the Central Bank broke the limit and sold gold at a high black market price, which was not in line with the regulations. According to the regulations on the buying and selling of gold, issued by the Ministry of Finance, the limit for increases and decreases is 20%. The Central Bank did not submit a request to the Ministry of Finance for amendments before implementation, which surprised all the gold firms. There were no transactions in the afternoon due to the scarcity of people.

[Report from This Newspaper] Off-exchange spot trading opened at 3.35 million-3.45 million due to heavy pressure from the Central Bank. There was some buying at low prices, with securities firms showing strong demand, and prices once rose to 3.65 million-3.75 million, before falling to 3.5 million-3.6 million near noon.

In the afternoon, next-day trading opened at 3.75 million-3.85 million. Due to active selling from Northern and Shanxi firms, prices briefly exceeded 4 million, reaching as high as 4.1 million-4.2 million.

The Central Bank, entrusting Dadecheng and Zhaofengchang, used a two-pronged approach, continuously selling 1,700 large bars with next-day settlement at 4 million, lowering the price all the way to 3.75 million. Sentiment softened, and closing prices fell to 3.8 million-3.9 million, deducting interest of 400,000, an increase of 200,000 from the previous day's settlement.

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, off-exchange futures trading opened in the morning at 3.3 million-3.4 million, rising as high as 3.9 million-3.95 million, and closing in the afternoon at 3.53 million-3.58 million. Afternoon trading opened at 3.9 million-3.95 million, falling to 3.88 million-3.93 million. Various firms aggressively sought supplies, and prices rose all the way to 4.18 million-4.23 million, before closing lower at 4.07 million-4.12 million. Interest was paid at 400,000 yuan per tael, calculated based on a price of 4 million.

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, off-exchange trading of US dollars remained scarce, with the trend not as strong as silver dollars. Morning prices opened at 71,000-74,000, rising to 75,000-78,000, and closing at 73,000-76,000. Afternoon next-day trading opened at 82,000-87,000, rising to 84,000-89,000, and closing at 83,000-86,000, deducting interest of 8,000, an increase of 7,000 yuan from the previous day's settlement.

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, jewelry gold opened flat, still listed at 3.3 million-3.65 million. Near noon, prices rose to 3.35 million-3.7 million. Afternoon prices rose to 3.6 million-4 million, a further increase of 300,000 from the previous day. Jewelry silver remained stable, with the purchase price increased by 5,000 to 35,000, but the selling price remained unchanged at 45,000. Money exchange businesses hung red signs, with morning prices at 3.5 million-3.7 million and afternoon prices rising to 3.7 million-3.9 million.

### Market Money Tight

The market money market was already seen to be tight yesterday morning. Because the prices of various goods in the market had already successively surged to a peak, interbank lending also followed, with the lowest price for daily lending at 60 yuan per thousand yuan, and the highest at 150 yuan. After the Central Bank sold gold off-exchange the day before, market money initially loosened and then tightened. Although people in various industries felt that prices had reached their peak, the foundation was unstable. The Central Bank may sell a large amount of gold within the day, and prices will fall back. Yesterday morning, market prices mostly hovered on a firm path and did not create new records. The interest on goods for each industry was 60-65 yuan for securities, 100 yuan for yarn, 110 yuan for rayon factories, 90-100 yuan for silk, 150 yuan for sugar, and 110 yuan for daily necessities cigarettes.

### Gold Control Bureau Sends Personnel to Inspect Banks and Firms

[Report from This Newspaper] The Central Bank's Discount and Loan Committee held its 34th regular meeting at 4 PM yesterday, with Li Fuxun acting as chairman, discussing and approving multiple cases of transportation, public utilities, industrial and mining production, and agricultural loans.

### Foreign Exchange Certificates Stabilize

The market for foreign exchange transfer certificates was stable yesterday. The morning opened at 58,000 yuan, and some retail investors bought in, pushing the price up to 60,000 yuan. Later, due to tight market money and fragile sentiment, the price retreated to 59,000 yuan at midday, on par with the previous high, a slight increase of 200 yuan from the previous closing price.

### Dragon Well Firmly Navigates the Market

This year's Hangzhou "Before the Rain" new Dragon Well tea is expected to be shipped to Shanghai this week to meet market demand. According to industry insiders, although the region is blessed by nature, making its products better than those of Wenzhou, Zhejiang, the tea body is not as fresh and tender as in previous years due to the erratic rainfall this year. Tea farmers and merchants generally expressed dissatisfaction with this. As for the new Dragon Well from Wenzhou, the source continues unabated, but the quality is aging day by day. Price cuts among industry peers are intended to benefit downstream customers, but since non-industry materials and freight rates are cyclically rising, costs are repeatedly increasing, so they are still struggling in their original paths. For other varieties, although market money is tighter than before, sentiment is not discouraged, and they continue to firmly navigate the market.

### Situation Improves Day by Day; Chinese Stocks Rise Again

[Report from This Newspaper] The Chinese stock market continued its upward trend yesterday, carrying on the momentum from the previous night. In the past, the market had lagged for a long time due to constraints from the situation and threats from the external environment. Recently, with the overall situation easing, the public is paying attention. Although the market money trend was slightly tighter yesterday, the supply of funds was still smooth, and bullish sentiment spread across the board, leading to a firm market and ultimately a rise.

Yongsha opened in the morning at 36.5 yuan. Due to consecutive days of gains and tight market money, overnight bulls frequently liquidated, softening the market slightly and falling to 35.5-35.8 yuan, the lowest price after opening. Swiftly replenishing short positions and squeezing spot chips, sentiment suddenly lifted, with various firms frequently absorbing, rising to 40.07 yuan. Subsequently, news of falling gold prices and pressure from the Central Bank caused institutions to sell at high prices, and the market suddenly fell, hovering around 39.8-39.9 yuan. Later, hearing that the Yongsha interest payment was 60-65 yuan, major players strongly supported the market, rising to 41.3 yuan. Retail investors competed to sell, and the market closed at 39.3 yuan.

Small and medium-sized stocks opened weak in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon. Xinhe rose from 8.3 yuan to the 9.5 yuan limit, and Xinguang was quiet in the previous market but soared to 3.11 yuan to the limit near closing. Qinxing Jingfu first leveled and then rose. Miscellaneous stocks Shangwu Kaifu saw 8.99 yuan and hit the limit, and Zhabei Shangni Neiyi Lian'an Taitang, etc., all hit the limit, and the remaining stocks were also popular.

In the afternoon, market money loosened, and remittances from various banks and branches poured in, with frequent disbursements, and shadow interest retreated to 6-7 points. Gold outside the ring rose again, and buying remained strong. Yongsha initially traded at 43.8 yuan, 44.3 yuan, slightly softening and consolidating in the middle, but the trend remained firm, ultimately closing at 44.4 yuan. Settlement transactions opened at 40 yuan, and then rose all the way, closing at 43.2 yuan.

Small and medium-sized stocks settlement transactions: Meiya 1.13 yuan to the limit, Xinguang 3.11, Jingfu 1.46, Qinxing 2.08 points, Neiyi 1.15, Yonggong 9.5 yuan, Tongyi 13.2 points, Zhonghuo 22.8 points, Taitang 84,670 yuan, Zhongfa 8.29, all to the limit.

### Gold Bonds Rise; Foreign Stocks Squeezed Lower

The market for gold bonds continued to be popular. With the approach of peace talks, sentiment was optimistic, and prices outside the ring were strong, improving buying sentiment. The morning opened with buying at 1.35 million, rising all the way to 1.53 million. Subsequently, hearing that gold prices were soft, buyers were cautious, and market prices also softened, before rising again near closing, ultimately closing at the 1,584,000 yuan limit.

The after-market initially traded with buying at 1.55 million, rising to 1,584,000 yuan, squeezing up 264,000 yuan, with 37 taels traded.

Yesterday, foreign stocks were slightly soft due to tighter market money and sharply reduced buying. Yisha 90,000-92,000, falling 2,000 yuan. British Union 95,000-98,000, retreated 8,000 yuan. Yipi 17,000-18,000, down 1,000 yuan. Ye Guang 33,000 buying, no selling. Asian 9,100-9,300. Huidefeng calling for 350,000 buying, no selling.

### Tight Funds, High Shadow Interest; Rice Prices Slightly Decline, White Rice Closing at 400,000 Yuan

The rice market was weak yesterday, due to the excessive gains the previous day, tight funds in the market, and high shadow interest. Many holders sought to sell at the opening, and prices for all grades of goods fell by 30,000-50,000 yuan. Later, gold prices rose, and various parties absorbed at low prices, stopping the decline and rebounding. White rice closed at 400,000, with next-day payments at 420,000 yuan, a fall of 10,000 yuan from the previous day. The situation in the Northern market was stable, with white rice priced at 380,000.

Cooking Oil

Prices declined across the board, with a peaceful atmosphere in the market and tight funds. Retail investors sold off to seek cash, and factory soybean oil fell by 200,000, while rapeseed oil fell by 200 marks. The arrival of raw oil was not much, a slight drop of 100,000 yuan. Sesame oil holders raised prices, the market was stable, and Jitone trucks still traded at 2.35 million. Soybean cake fell first and then rebounded, and Changzi cakes traded at 128,000 yuan.

Flour

The market was firmly stable. From the beginning of the market to before closing, due to tight funds, falling rice prices, and fragile sentiment, buyers were mostly cautious, fearing large sales by the Central Bank, and the market remained in a sluggish path. Until the closing, there was no news of sales by the Central Bank, and market buying quickly became strong, and the market rose. Lao Che called for 146,000 yuan, and Bingchuan was last traded at 143,500 yuan, a slight increase of 2,000 yuan from yesterday.

Miscellaneous Grains

Prices fell across the board, but red grain was scarce, and the market could not meet demand. The market was unique in rising amid the decline of all goods and hit the 200,000 mark. Soybeans were weakening step by step, corn fell by 10,000 yuan, sesame trading was strong, and raw kernels did not trade.

### Market Ramblings

— By a Spectator

Silver Dollar Arbitrage Trading Intensifies Extraction of Blood from Rural Areas

Miscellaneous Brands of Silver Dollars Complain; Seems Like an Anti-Yuan Movement

Many banks and firms are rushing to engage in silver dollar arbitrage.

Once this trend starts, silver dollars from all over the country will be swallowed up by Shanghai, which has the greatest capacity.

Since the nationalization of silver in the winter of 1935, most of the silver in major cities has been converted to paper money. Only rural areas, which are highly conservative, may have a habit of hoarding silver.

The silver dollars circulating in the market now are probably mostly from rural areas. After silver dollar arbitrage, the speed at which silver dollars flow from various regions to Shanghai will inevitably increase.

Undoubtedly, this is the work of urban capital extracting blood from the vast rural areas.

Optimistic air such as "Peace Talks" and "Ceasefire" is very strong, reflected in the market, stocks rose wildly and then rose more wildly, and the general commodity market tended to be weak.

People need peace and also need to alleviate the high price pressure. With the success of peace, the price pressure will also be lifted. Just the optimistic air has entered the market, and the market has already changed. This shows that

But before the facts are actually realized, one should not "take chicken feathers as imperial arrows." Currently, it is still hot and cold, and one must be careful when entering and exiting the market.

With the upcoming mid-month salary payment, the rise of silver dollars is becoming more and more popular.

The pride of the Yuan Datou era; sailing ships, Sun Yat-sen heads, eagle dollars, dragon dollars, etc., are far behind. In terms of fineness and weight, they should not be so far apart, and many people complain for Sun Yat-sen heads, etc.

In fact, there is no need to complain. As long as you have a sense of what is already available, "People despise it, so I buy. People value it, so I abandon," is the main secret of the Jews. One day, when the "Look Alike Order" arrives, grievances can also be resolved.

Recently, there have been rumors in the market that the Central Bank will recoin Yuan heads. The Central Bank's denial is of course the fact, but such news will not disappear and may even be intensified in the future.

You should know that this is the beginning of the "Anti-Yuan Movement." Since someone launched it, there will be a day of success.

Similarly, Citibank has recently faded in obscurity.

At the time of 8/19, exchanging one US dollar for two silver dollars was already abuse. Now, one-to-one is even more abuse.

I don't think there is any need to complain, as long as you have a good idea of where the high profits come from, there will always be seeds left in the unfeeling times.

Please be very careful. American and British merchants of Jewish descent who can use their brains have one thing. There is a possibility that "Yuan Datou" imported goods will be listed and sell off US dollars.

The gold market has entered a new stage; that is, the daily limit increase. Only with the daily limit increase can the off-exchange price stand firm.

Slightly sell off-exchange overnight, and then buy back the next morning. Slightly supply for sale again in the afternoon, and then replenish again the next morning. By doing so, you earn interest and earn the price, and it is insured.

### Cotton Yarn Retreats

The cotton yarn market was stable and weak. The reprinting industry was saturated and turned to wait-and-see attitude. In addition, the money report was tight, and the daily deduction was as high as 1.2 yuan. The customer gang also stopped entering the market, but the holders still rarely took off their hands, so there were not many transactions in the market.

42-strand Blue Phoenix initially opened at 25.5 million yuan, and at one point progressed to 28.5 million yuan. At closing, it resumed to the downstream trend, ending at 26 million yuan, down 1 million yuan from the previous one.

32-strand Silver Moon slightly fell by 100,000 yuan, ending at 16.1 million yuan.

21-strand Double Horse spot goods started at 12.7 million yuan, once hitting 13 million yuan, and closed at 12.3 million yuan, slightly down 400,000 yuan. Factory orders are still 100,000 yuan away from spot goods. 20-strand Double Horse was 800,000 yuan lower, and other grades were also slightly smaller, but 10-strand Boy Scouts and Siping Lian revealed their color.

### Cloth Market Crushes

The cloth market started low and continued yesterday. The money trend turned tight, and there were excessive leaps and bounds in recent days. People had some concerns. At the beginning of the morning, all parties took a wait-and-see attitude, and both buying and selling were sparse. Afterwards, the merchants on this street took in at low prices, and the market was slightly firm. The result was that the market still saw a crush compared with the after-market of the previous day.

Longtou Fine Cloth was pulled from 435,000 yuan to the highest level of 455,000 yuan. Near noon, it was once as low as 430,000 yuan. At noon, it closed at 443,000 yuan, a drop of 22,000 yuan. Sijunzi Biji broke through the 1 million yuan mark at the high end of the Silin factory. The buying was strong in the after-market, because the non-industry was all thriving. The initial Longtou Fine Cloth opened at 471,000 yuan, and Sijunzi Biji at 460,000 yuan. At the end, the former closed at 485,000 yuan and the latter at 474,000 yuan, an increase of 42,000 yuan to 46,000 yuan compared with the noon closing.

### Silk Saw Gains and Losses; Rayon Small Blanket Rose

The opening of excellent grade raw silk yesterday morning was 21 million yuan, and the noon closing was still 21 million, which was on par with the previous market, with few gains and losses.

Yesterday morning, the opening of rayon for spot delivery, Tianqiao and Siniya, was 12.5 million yuan. In the noon closing, the clear bill transaction rose to 13.5 million yuan, which was 3 million yuan less than the noon closing yesterday, due to the fragile sentiment of the people.

The Huaqiang Blanket of Silk, opened in the morning at 8.4 million yuan, and rose to 8.75 million yuan at noon closing, an increase of 128,400 yuan from the previous noon closing, and all have been upgraded by Xu Chengyun.

### Things to Know About Table Tennis

The following is a discussion about the use of the feet:

(1) Support weight with the front of the foot: Putting the body's center of gravity on the front of the foot can make the body light and agile. With agile movement, one can make sharp attacks. If the center of gravity is always on the heel, the body cannot be used freely, and the fighting spirit will inevitably be diminished. At this point, one only has the ability to defend against attacks.

(2) Bend the knees to lean the body slightly forward: Bending the knees can make the body lean forward, shifting the center of gravity forward. In this way, the whole body is like a spring, and can cope freely in any direction. This is of great benefit for both forehand and backhand shots.

(3) The two feet should form an oblique line: When preparing to play, there are two theories about the position of the feet: one is the parallel theory, which keeps the feet parallel to the table tennis net; the other is the oblique line theory, which maintains a certain angle between the line connecting the two feet and the extension line of the net. When the feet are parallel, lateral movement is relatively easy, but there is a lack of convenience for forward and backward movement. Therefore, usually the feet maintain an angle of twenty degrees with the net.

(7) The Three Stages of Playing Table Tennis

Practicing table tennis can be divided into three stages: the first stage is the beginner stage; the second stage is the training stage; and the third stage is the skilled stage.

During the learning stage, one must concentrate all of one's attention on one point of the ball, because the position where the ball bounces on the table, the ball speed, the ball's rotation speed, and the ball's direction of rotation can be understood after the ball hits the table. At the same time, pay attention to hitting the ball in the middle of the paddle when returning the ball. Hitting the ball in the middle of the paddle is very difficult, but the rebounding force of the middle of the paddle is the strongest, and various playing methods can also be accurate. The rebounding force of the four sides of the paddle is reduced, and there is little confidence in using various paddle methods. Therefore, in the beginner stage, one must pay close attention to the ball, and at the same time, pay attention to hitting the returned ball in the middle of the paddle.

During this stage, it is not advisable to imitate skilled table tennis players and hit hard balls indiscriminately. Pay attention to not touching the net and not going out of the table, fully restrain the ball, and hit the ball within one foot of the baseline. Also, first practice hitting the ball well in front of one's body with the hand holding the paddle, and then practice hitting the ball by pulling the hand holding the paddle backwards. Only after these two hitting methods are learned can one practice sideways hitting.

After each return of the ball, one must always be prepared to return the next ball, because only by being prepared at all times can one cope at any time, otherwise one will be subjected to unexpected attacks and be at a loss.

Only after one can hit the ball almost every time in the middle of the paddle and hit the opponent's table almost every time can one be considered to have completed the first stage of the course.

During the training stage, one should pay attention to correcting one's weaknesses, and practice various hitting methods. Having fewer hitting methods means having more flaws and more opportunities for the opponent to attack. One must also learn to conserve physical strength, attacking only where one should attack, and defending where one should defend. Do not move rashly when not defending, and respond quickly, in order to fight for a long time.

In addition to this, one must also pay attention to the opponent's movements, because understanding the opponent's movements can predict the direction of the opponent's return. The observation methods are roughly as follows:

1. The posture of the wrist, paddle, and body before and during hitting the ball;

2. The position of oneself and the opponent, and the hitting posture;

3. The position of the opponent and the table tennis net;

4. The position of the paddle;

5. Research on the opponent's habits and common tactics.

Being able to pay attention to the above points makes it not difficult to predict what kind of ball the opponent will hit.

During this stage, one must not only correct one's weaknesses, practice various hitting methods, and pay attention to the opponent's movements, but also train one's hands and feet. Training one's hands is the most important thing, but it will not be successful if the feet do not actively help when hitting the ball. To cope with the opponent's attacks, one must have a flexible response. This kind of all-around skill relies on the movement of the feet.

By the skilled stage, one should have a thorough understanding of the principles of playing table tennis, and play the ball very well. One should also be used to seeing the opponent's usual movements. Therefore, table tennis players in this period are limited to ordinary viewing, and should do more observation before the battle, making final corrections to one's own return.

### Softball League to Open on May 1st: Grand Scale and Unprecedented Excitement

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Paomao County Softball League will open on May 1st. This year's league will see all of Shanghai's top teams participating, making it a grand event unseen since the end of the war. In previous years, the competition was divided into two units: military and civilian, organized separately by the U.S. Navy Sports Department and the International Sports Association. This year, a flexible approach has been adopted, with the two organizations jointly hosting the event. Bringing together elite troops from both sides in one league, the grand competition that will unfold can be imagined.

Among the Chinese teams, only the reigning champion Panda team has formally registered to join so far. The Bee team, mainly composed of athletes from St. John's University, has not yet made a move. The registration deadline was originally set for this Friday, but to facilitate the registration procedures for other teams that did not participate in the previous competition, the organizing committee has decided to extend it to next Monday (the 18th). Chinese military teams interested in competing with foreigners can contact the International Sports Association in Paomao or Mr. Kelibote, one of the league organizers.

The teams that have already registered include ten units: Panda, Wild Duck, Texaco, Country Club, Holy Riders, Portuguese Business, and the U.S. military's Weather, Aviation, Harbor, and Officers teams. Teams that have been notified but have not completed registration include West Blue, Catholic League, Civil Aviation Brigade, Aurora University, Filipino Musicians Association, and the American Academy.

It is expected that more than 30 teams will participate in this year's competition, so it is possible that they will be divided into groups based on their strength.

To ensure the smooth progress of this grand league, the organizing committee will hold a meeting of representatives from all participating teams next Monday in Paomao to discuss the various details of the league. It has also been decided to open all the ballparks in Paomao from today onwards to allow the teams to practice. According to the announcement from the authorities: Teams that have already registered and wish to use the field can contact Mr. Cox by phone. The phone numbers are 30056 and 37437.

### Basketball League Jia 2B: Huili Wins Championship

Three games of the Basketball League Jia 2 Group were held last night at the City Gymnasium. In the final battle of Group B, Huili faced the Police Machinery team to determine the group's top spot. Huili defeated the Police Machinery team by a large margin of 56 to 26, achieving an excellent record of five consecutive victories. In the other two matches, Chongde lost to Red Riders, and Pushui defeated Chenyou.

Red Riders defeated Chongde (Jia 2D) 54-48

Pushui defeated Chenyou (Jia 2D) 40-32

In the final Jia 2B match, Huili B played against Police Machinery. At the start of the battle, Wang Shide of Huili B scored the first point under the basket. Lu Dinghou and Zheng Yunzhong followed, and Huili B took a 6-0 lead. The Police Machinery team tried hard to supply points, and Gu Zhenji pulled back a goal, but Huili B's offense continued, and the score kept increasing. The Police Machinery team's formation was loose and often suffered losses. By the end of the first half, Huili B was leading 20-11.

In the second half, both sides made adjustments to their lineups. Huili B played even more smoothly, with Zheng Bizhong in charge. The Police Machinery team was unable to stop their momentum, and their defense was terribly lax, with frequent loopholes. Therefore, Huili B was allowed to trample on them. By the end of the match, Huili B had won a big victory with a score of 56 to 26.

### 4th Table Tennis League: Post Office Meets Bank of China Today

The 4th Shanghai Table Tennis League has already started mobilizing the second division teams since last night. Apart from the Jingzong and Wangye locations, other venues such as Shanbao, Yousi, and Xinyi, although not spacious, were crowded with fans, and the venue managers were unable to accommodate everyone. This shows that table tennis has aroused the interest of people from all walks of life, which is the result of the enthusiastic promotion by the organizing committee.

Starting at 7:00 PM tonight (the 13th), there will be six more matches, including one first division match and five second division matches, held in five ballrooms including the Post Office and Guohuo. The schedule is as follows:

### Army Armored Team Slightly Wins Over Pele

The Army Armored Headquarters basketball team played against Pele at the team's stadium on Dianlu Road yesterday at 5:30 PM. The referee was Wu Zibin. The strengths of both sides were almost equal, and the match was very close. The first half ended in a tie at 11. After switching sides, the scores were very close, and it was difficult to tell who would win. The Army Armored team finally won slightly by a score of 38 to 35, with a difference of one and a half goals, because they were more familiar with the venue.

### 4th University Games Changed to be Held in Nanshi

The 4th University Games held its third preparatory meeting last Saturday, and it was resolved that: (1) The games were originally scheduled to be held at Shanghai University on April 30th, but because the school is located in Pudong and transportation is inconvenient, and the budget is quite large, in order to save on the cost of the games, it was changed to be held at the Nanshi Stadium, which has been approved. The date remains the same. (2) The registration fee and expenses were originally set at one stone and five dou of rice for each participating school. In order to reduce the burden on each school, it was changed to one stone. The insufficient amount will still be prepared by Shanghai University. (3) Registration will still be done at the Shanggongyuan at 209 Yuanmingyuan Road. When registering, in addition to submitting the registration list, please also pay one stone of the current market price of Shangbai Geng rice on that day (Langqi checks must be paid before 11:00 AM). (4) The venue equipment group should send a letter to the Nanshi Stadium to take on the responsibility.

The preparatory committee has already sent the report name list to each school. If you have not received it, you can send a letter to the preparatory office of Shanghai University to request it.

### Lawn Tennis Match: Hong Kong Defeats Saigon Again

[Hong Kong Air News] After completing their matches in France, the Saigon tennis players passed through Hong Kong on their way back to Vietnam. The Hong Kong Tennis Association contacted them and held a friendly match with the Vietnamese team. The friendly match was held on grass and hard courts. The hard court tennis match was held the previous weekend, and Hong Kong won by 3-2, with Lai Yekuan winning both singles matches and Ye Guanxiong and Xu Weipei winning one doubles match. The grass court match continued last weekend, and Hong Kong won again by 4-1. The results of the five matches are as follows:

Ye Guanxiong 6-4 8-6 Arong

Wen Sui 3-6 6-3 6-3 Xu Weipei

Ye Guanxiong 1-6 6-3 6-0 Wen Sui

Ye Guanxiong Cai Huiquan 5-7 6-4 6-4 Wen Sui Arong

Note that Cai Huiquan is our country's Taiwan Cup player. He recently returned from Singapore. This time, he partnered with Ye Guanxiong in doubles. Because Cai had not played a match in six months, he was a little rusty and often made mistakes. Although he led 5-3 in the first set, he was overtaken by the Vietnamese general. After the start of the second set, Ye Guanxiong worked hard and Cai also improved, and they won.

Overall, Ye Guanxiong's performance in several matches in this friendly match has been highly praised, and he is considered to be a promising figure in the future. It is a pity that this French general did not overcome Kleigang, and was unable to compete with Ye Guanxiong.

### Brown Victor Reigns in Australia

[Reuters, Melbourne, 11th] Veteran Brown Victor was today listed by the Australian Lawn Tennis Association as the top player in Australian tennis. In the women's Hall of Fame, Mrs. Bolton is in the top spot.

### China Airlines Team Returns to Shanghai: Two Victories in Qingdao

The China Aviation football team was invited by the Qingdao sports community to exchange football skills. A group of 15 people, led by Lu Weisen and Wu Shouwei, flew to Qingdao last Saturday for two matches. In the first match, they defeated the Zhongqing team, the champion of North China and the Northeast. (2-0) In the second match against the Qingdao United team, the audience was extremely crowded. The situation was as grand as the East China Qingdao situation in Shanghai. There were many spectators who were rejected outside the door. In addition to the original team from Zhongqing, the United team also gained assistance from famous Tianjin business team players Grace and Qiu Pulopov, as well as Shen Shuxuan, a good player from the Seoul team. In the battle, the China Aviation's Shanghai style won with a record of 5-1. The entire team returned to Shanghai by plane on the 11th.

### Nanshi Democratic Cup Football Match: Yingguang Loses Two Goals to Huaguang Today at 4:30 PM, a Match Between Daxia and Pan Team

Led by Wu Qixiang, the Huaguang football team worked hard last night with high spirits and defeated Yingguang 2-0. This was one scene in the Democratic Cup. There was no record in the first half. Shang Shiqi scored both goals, one three minutes after the change of positions, and one in the last nine minutes. Yingguang's athletes Yu Qia and Xu Buyun, etc., all work at the China Bookstore Printing Factory. Recently, the factory has been working overtime day and night to print banknotes to increase production, and they are not allowed to ask for leave, so they were unable to play yesterday, which greatly affected their strength. However, it was not easy for the team to maintain a 0-0 draw in the first half. Liu Longsheng, He Jiatong and goalkeeper Zheng Tongyu performed very well. If all the players are present, Yingguang is indeed an organization that cannot be underestimated and can compete with any strong team. With Wu Qixiang in charge of the center, the rear is less worried, and the forwards can therefore exert great power, and victory is appropriate.

The Huaguang football team, led by host Huang Jiabang, took an overnight train to Hangzhou for sightseeing yesterday, and took the opportunity to hold friendly matches with the Huanhu team and Zhijiang University. They will return to Shanghai by overnight train on Friday.

Because the Jiuzhou team has a Qingbai Railway War this Sunday and needs to conserve their energy and prepare for a major event, team captain Meng Yiliang requested that the Jiuzhou vs. Huaguang match this Friday be moved to next week. At the same time, Huaguang also has a trip to Hangzhou, so there will be no battles in Nanshi on Friday. Also, the Pan team will be visiting West Lake next Monday.

Today at 4:30 PM, there will be another Democratic Cup football match in Nanshi, where Daxia will meet the Pan team. The referee is Wang Lin, and the linesmen are Tan Rongsheng and Zhu Yibao. The players on both sides are young and full of fighting spirit. The scene will definitely be intense. Daxia has a strong line and strong feet. The Pan team's forward line is flexible, Qian Ming is as light as a swallow, and his small movements are particularly clever and beautiful. The two sides are evenly matched, and the outcome is unpredictable. The lineup is as follows:

### Registration for the 9th 90-Year Cup Miniature Ball Extended by Four Days

The registration for the 9th 90-Year Cup Miniature Football Tournament hosted by Xuhui Middle School was originally scheduled to close yesterday afternoon. Now, in order to allow the schools to prepare adequately, it has been extended by four days until the 16th (Saturday). Those who wish to join can complete the formalities at the Sports Department of the school on Xujiahui Road before that date.

### Football Commentary Last Week

There was nothing exciting to say about the two甲level football league matches last week, and the wins and losses were not significant to the overall situation. Qian Ming performed the results of the Mayor's Cup champion and won the Jingwu Association. With the help of Aunt Feng, the leading team won the Zhichao Association with a score of 2-1; the championship will be decided in the Qingbai vs. Railway battle this weekend, and the football season can end in mid-month.

Except for Fang Renqiu, the young players of Jingwu were not in good condition. Jingren, Zhigang, Yuqi, etc. were tired due to track and field practice, and their performance was far from ideal. They lost a total of four goals. Apart from Zhai Xigen and Long Qingxiang's clear goals, the remaining two goals were no different from giving them away with both hands. One goal was due to Chen Huimin's leaving the goal too early, resulting in an empty goal. The other was when Chen Lianglian kicked the grass, which was taken advantage of by Huo Tikgen. Three of the four goals were scored by head, which shows that the head attacks of the Xilu forwards posed a great threat to Jingwu's defenders. It is a pity that they did not have the shooting ability, and they missed opportunities one after another.

In terms of offense, Jingwu's offense was sharp and put pressure on the Railway in the first ten minutes. When Wang Guoguang's strength failed, the forward lacked an inner forward to lead the way. Wang, Wu, Fang, and Chen each had a shot, but unfortunately they lacked experience and failed.

The railway picked up Wu Binghao and replaced him with Gai Ziwen to fill the left wing. The speed of the two wings was obviously enhanced, and there was a performance of both wings flying together. This is the most ideal forward line for the railway. When playing Qingbai this weekend, it is better to use this lineup to strengthen Qian's offensive and hold the determination to fight back to the death, which is enough to threaten Qingbai.

The Longtou team performed well at the beginning of the season, but their performance has been far inferior to that at the beginning of the season. There is an image of the Longtou team seeing the head but not the tail. The problem lies in the fact that there are too many contacts and competitions, and the players are already in a state of fatigue. Secondly, it is because all teams have made progress, while the Longtou team is still in a state of stagnation. Whether in Nanshi or Yiyuan, every game relies on strength rather than strategy, relying only on rushing, horizontal, and hard shots. In the second half, the wind only surrounded Zhichao for more than fifteen minutes without any gain. If it were not for the help of Aunt Feng and Sheng Peter's carelessness, which caused Zhichao to lose its momentum and lose another goal, then Longtou's defeat to Zhichao would have been possible. In defense, Zhichao laid down two doors, and the Longtou forwards' attack was blocked everywhere. Jiang Kun and Xia Shude had the opportunity. Unfortunately, they did not use angled shots and only made straight hard shots. Even a strong crossbow's tip can penetrate　　. They were all blocked by Qixiang and caught by Peter. Peter is like A Dou, and Qixiang is like Yu Long. Under Zhao Yun's cover, A Dou was only in danger but not harmed. The forwards are full of fighting spirit, but only lack experience. (Qi Gong)

### On Lying

— Sobey

The difficulty of lying lies in the expression.

When children lie, before they even finish their words, the corners of their mouths already betray a guilty smile. It's the same with naive news reporters when they fabricate "April Fool's" fake news. These people's expressions (i.e., "acting") are simply not up to par.

There are two famous liars in the world whose acting is very authentic. One is Yang Mei from Sichuan, China, and the other is Mussolini, who has already been condemned by history to death. The former spared no effort to endure the suffering of hunger, upholding the spirit of "feeling the hunger of others as if it were one's own," and fabricating shocking "truths"—that one can survive without eating. She endured twenty-one days of the greatest human suffering (suffering sufficient to end her life) just to prove that "hunger is not a social problem." Liars who present themselves with an attitude of compassion for humanity abound, but few can be as sincere and earnest as Yang Mei. Therefore, when Yang Mei's news first appeared, the masses applauded and supported it, placing great hopes on her.

This shows that even the biggest lie, as long as the "acting" is authentic, is enough to make people believe it to be true, or at least half believe it. Today's professional liars, although they all proclaim to be saving the masses, their expressions and acting are too childish, so they cannot gain the trust of the people.

The other professional liar, Mussolini, although his acting was slightly inferior to our "Yang Mei," was able to "dedicate himself to the task until his dying day, seeing it through to the end." He talked nonsense all year round, claiming to be acting on behalf of Heaven, aiming to save countless people all over the world. The first time he said this, people didn't believe him; the second time, the third time, they still didn't believe him. But he was not discouraged, saying, "As long as you say it a hundred times in a row, people will believe it!" Mussolini was able to remain in power for more than twenty years entirely because of this method.

The spirit of the above two master liars can be emulated by today's liars.

Liars! Lie to your heart's content. Anyway, "People deceive people, deceiving people to death without compensation!" How about taking this common saying as your "motto"?

### Cat

— Qian Dacheng

When cats are mentioned, I have so much to say. -- A book dedicated to cats is called "Cat Garden." I don't intend to quote even a word or half a sentence from it to lengthen my writing. Now, I'm only talking about the impressions cats give me.

About eight or nine years ago, a black and white female cat suddenly came to my house. After it came, it never left. If you fed it rice, it would eat. If you picked it up and put it on your lap, it would not move. So people said, "Cats bring wealth, dogs bring poverty, that's a very good thing!" I also thought it was a very good thing. After a few years, it quietly left again. The reason why, I didn't know at that time. But it left behind a kitten, which was tortoiseshell colored, and not bad. This kitten now already has several generations of descendants. It's very well-behaved. When it begs me for fish bones, it even stands up like a pug, and can also use its two front paws to catch things. When I'm eating, it comes as soon as I call it. But at other times, I can't call it no matter how much I call. Not only can't I call it, but when it hears my voice, it simply ignores me, and sometimes even deliberately walks far away. So I get a little angry, feeling that cats are, after all, snobbish creatures. Based on the saying "Cats bring wealth," I can even more judge that cats are snobbish creatures. The old cat's coming and going must have been because my family used to have fish and meat to eat, but later it became less and less every day. At the same time, it found a wealthy new owner, so of course it had to turn its head and not return. This proves that my family certainly has very little meat to eat, but some people's families are much better than ours!

More than a month ago, that tortoiseshell cat also ran away. A week later, it came back dejectedly, and its weight was almost half less. After it came back, it immediately ate, and the amount it ate was even more than double what it usually ate. So I speculated that its motive for leaving was to find a more fishy bowl of rice, but as a result, it almost starved to death. This also proves that my family now has almost no meat to eat, but many families nearby are probably simply without meat, or perhaps even white rice has become a problem. Otherwise, in Jiangnan, where keeping cats is a common practice, how could it have starved for six or seven days? -- From the successive departures of two cats, I was able to realize a lesson in real life.

During the period of the occupation, I absolutely worshipped cats, not only "welcoming cats," but also willingly becoming a cat. I once asked a friend to draw a picture of a cat, and I even wrote a poem on it myself, saying: "I have wasted my life reading military strategies, and have never done anything to serve the country. The rats jump and make trouble in the bright daylight, and I am willing to transform into an old male cat." Cats are just cats, but my impression of them changes from time to time. Now, although I am still willing to be a cat, I definitely do not want to be a pet cat lying on the lap of a noble lady. I want to be an old male cat that catches jumping and cunning rats. As for cats playing with butterflies in the shade of flowers, they are even more what I despise. -- Postscript

### Change to Fifty Thousand

— Zhuo Zhi

According to reports, the Central Bank has shipped a large number of five-yuan gold yuan notes from the United States, which were originally printed during the price-limited period last year. Now they have finally been shipped to port. "One step late," they can no longer be circulated on the market. The Central Bank considers the losses to be huge and is currently investigating responsibility, etc.

I think it is unnecessary to investigate responsibility. Because there was nothing wrong with printing five-yuan notes. If it were US dollars, it would not be too late to ship them now. The problem lies in inflation, so if we get to the bottom of it, it won't look good for anyone.

However, it would be a pity to discard this large batch of foreign-printed banknotes. So how to use them? I think it's very simple. As long as the Central Bank prints a "Change to Fifty Thousand" on them, like a stamp, they can be issued. Banknotes printed in the United States are naturally exquisitely printed and have excellent paper quality, which must be much more beautiful than the batch of ten thousand yuan notes printed by the Central Printing Factory. Then the people will be eager to welcome them, and naturally there will be nothing to say.

In this way, this batch of five-yuan foreign goods will not become a loss. It can both make the most of waste and alleviate the shortage of cash. Wouldn't it be killing two birds with one stone?

### Genealogy of the Gold Yuan

The trees on the grave have grown thick. A mound of yellow earth. Alas! Approaching the end. How long is life? About to emerge. 1

### Honest Reward

— Chen Yaoguang

One of the two young ladies suddenly remembered that she had not bought a ticket when the bus was about to arrive at the station, so she wanted to go back to the carriage to buy a ticket.

The other one advised her not to, and said to her, "What will happen if you get off the bus without buying a ticket?"

"I think one should always be honest in life!" she said, and then went to buy a ticket.

After a while, she walked out of the carriage and said to her friend with a smile, "Look, haven't I been rewarded for my honesty? I gave him a one-yuan bill, and he actually gave me a five-yuan bill in change!"

### Remembering Mr. Liu Ziheng

— Xu Ze

The three mysterious guests who came to Beijing from Pingyin once aroused the interest and attention of many people. One of them was Mr. Liu Ziheng. He and I have a past relationship, which I will briefly introduce here. I think it is also something that people from all walks of life would like to hear. Mr. Liu is from Shandong, tall and thin, and usually wears a blue gown. He is vegetarian and does not eat meat. Because he grew up in Shandong, he deeply studied the doctrines of Confucius and Mencius from a young age, and he especially studied the Lao-Zhuang School. He is indeed a well-learned scholar.

In the spring of the 30th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Liu and I met at the guesthouse of the Third War Zone Commander's Office. At that time, Mr. Liu and Mr. Liu Yizheng were both honored guests of Gu Mosan. At that time, Mr. Liu had just come from Hengyang. He looked like he was in his forties, sincere and honest, and kind to people. In addition to explaining Zhuangzi to Gu Mosan, he also discussed ancient and modern times with Mr. Yizheng every day, and the listeners were moved. When the Zhejiang-Jiangxi War broke out, he moved to Mafu in Jianyang, Fujian, with Mr. Yizheng, which was less than a hundred steps away from my residence. Whenever the sun set in the west, he would wander along the river with Mr. Yizheng, Brother Yang Tiandao, and me to express the accumulated feelings of the day. Not long after, when the Japanese bandits withdrew from Yushan, Mr. Liu had a trip to Guangxi, so he said goodbye to us and left. Now it has been eight or nine years since I last saw him. This time, he came to Beijing from Pingyin to seek peace for the country, to seek welfare for the people, and to eliminate the difficulties of peace talks. Is his contribution less than what it was in the past!

### A Record of Seeking Medical Treatment

— Bai Chu

(1)

My friend contracted lung disease.

(2)

He noticed blood streaks in his sputum and remembered the afternoon fever he had recently been experiencing, which made him suspect that he had lung disease.

Lung disease is terrible, especially for a salaried worker with the burden of a family. He had to reluctantly spend money that was originally intended for buying rice to consult a doctor and seek a diagnosis.

(3)

The consultation fee for the first doctor was 10,000. After taking an X-ray, he concluded: "There are a few black spots on your lungs." He felt that this was not getting to the point.

The consultation fee for the second doctor was 40,000. After taking an X-ray, he also concluded: "Your lungs are full of black spots."

The third doctor was a Ph.D. from Germany and a lung disease expert. The consultation fee was two silver dollars, and he stipulated that he would not accept gold yuan notes. After taking an X-ray, the doctor said very seriously:

"There is something wrong with your left lung."

"Are there some black spots in some places?"

"No, I'm afraid it's already corroding."

Oh my god! He gasped.

(4)

Lung disease was a definite fact, although the degree of the three doctors' diagnoses differed.

But one thing was consistent: they all told him to go to the hospital quickly, get lung disease-specific medicine, and have regular check-ups.

Hospital? How could a poor public school teacher afford to stay in a hospital?

My friend gritted his teeth and prepared to tough it out.

However, his family panicked, and his friends also panicked. This thing can take people's lives! How could he "tough it out"?

After much persuasion from many people, he understood the ancient saying, "As long as the green hills remain, there's no need to worry about firewood," and agreed to go to the hospital.

(5)

So: he took off his watch, and his wife took out the gold earrings and gold bracelets that she had brought as dowry.

Holding more than 600,000 in cash, he stepped into a hospital that others recommended as the most affordable.

After explaining his purpose, the hospital staff handed him a price list, scrutinizing him with cold eyes. Indeed, he was dressed too poorly.

My friend stared at the price list. Naturally, first class was out of his reach, so he could skip it.

What about second class? 50,000 a day, plus 100,000 for food and injections. He couldn't afford it!

Third class was marked as sixteen people per room, totaling 60,000 a day. He didn't want that either.

But, but there was no fourth class. He calculated for a long time before deciding to slowly walk to the registration window.

(6)

He registered and presented the pile of cash he had just exchanged for things.

The abacus inside made a series of sounds, and then a sentence was thrown out:

"Pay 1.4 million first."

"What! That much?" My friend was shocked.

Perhaps the gentleman inside was already used to such questions. He was not flustered and calmly recited the bill with a hint of sarcasm:

"A deposit of 800,000, and an advance payment of 600,000 for ten days of expenses, totaling 1.4 million."

"Deposit? Why do you need a deposit?"

"This is the hospital's rule. All hospitals are like this. Without a deposit, who will we turn to if you can't pay the bill in the future?"

"Then let me find a guarantor!"

"Please don't joke. We only accept deposits and don't want any shop or factory guarantors."

(7)

My friend couldn't get into the hospital.

He deposited the cash for a few days of interest, bought silver dollars, bought and sold, and now he's doing quite well, steadily earning tens of thousands of yuan every day.

I saw him recently, and he was radiant. I don't know if it's a periodic flare-up of stage X lung disease, or if it's because he's getting rich and happy.

But one thing is worth noting: his family is no longer worried about his illness.

Maybe he's already healed.
