### The President Hosts a Dinner for Leaders of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties, Carefully Listening to Peace Proposals, and Convening a Central Political Committee Meeting This Morning for Discussion

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] In order to carefully listen to opinions from all sides and decide how to handle the eight conditions proposed by Mao Zedong, the President hosted a dinner at his official residence on Huangpu Road at 7:30 PM on the 16th, inviting leaders from the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and important figures from the Kuomintang to gather and seek their opinions. The President began by asking all attendees, especially the leaders of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties, to express their views on the eight conditions of the Communist Party. Subsequently, Zhang Junmai, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, stated that the Communist Party's ability to propose such conditions warranted careful study and a positive response in order to promote the realization of peace. Zuo Shunsheng of the Youth Party also expressed the hope for the promotion of peace and emphasized the importance of cultivating new forces. Shao Lizi, a veteran of the Kuomintang, stated that we should recognize and acknowledge reality, face the current problems squarely, and seek solutions. Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party also spoke, arguing that whether it is peace or war, we must have our own methods and strength. Overall, the speeches of today's attendees were very practical. Although this post-dinner discussion did not yield concrete results, it did reflect the opinions of all parties. After all parties had finished speaking, the President specifically said to Zhang Junmai, "I will study it again when I have the chance." The important meeting concluded at 10:00 PM. Those invited to participate in today's meeting included Zhang Junmai, Jiang Yuntian, Zuo Shunsheng, Wu Zhongxin, Sun Ke, Shao Lizi, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Zheng Yanfen, and others.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] At the invitation of the President, Zhang Junmai, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 16th. Zhang Qun and Jiang Yuntian met him at the train station. They went directly to Zhang Qun's residence for a long conversation. Zhang also visited various friends in the afternoon. He attended the President's dinner in the evening. It is heard that he will not leave Beijing in the coming days and will continue to discuss the Communist Party's statement with the President.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] In order to solicit opinions from within the Kuomintang on Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation, President Chiang Kai-shek will convene a Central Political Committee meeting on the morning of the 17th to discuss this issue, so as to make decisions after gathering the opinions of people from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties.

[Our Dispatch] The leaders of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties here, Zhang Junmai and Zuo Shunsheng, have already arrived in Beijing to discuss the major plan for peace talks with the authorities. It is heard that people from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties in Shanghai had previously exchanged views on peace talks, all hoping that the peace talks would be successful soon. It is heard that the Democratic Socialist Party will suggest to the authorities that they give the people of the China Democratic League in Shanghai more opportunities for activity. At the same time, they also hope that the government will invite people from the "third force" remaining in Beiping, such as Zhang Dongsun and Liang Shuming, to come to Beijing, as they are mostly bridges for promoting peace talks. After coming to Beijing, they should be able to speed up the progress of peace talks.

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday's newspaper reported that Zhang Zhizhong came to Shanghai from Beijing to invite leaders of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties and the China Democratic League to come to Beijing to discuss the major plan for peace talks. This reporter went to Zhang's residence for an interview. According to Zhang's family, Zhang has not yet come to Shanghai.

[Our Dispatch] Ye Duyi, the former spokesperson of the China Democratic League, said yesterday that so far, the Nanjing government has not sent anyone to contact the leaders of the China Democratic League remaining in Shanghai about going to Beijing. Zhang Lan, Huang Yanpei, and Luo Longji are all currently in Shanghai.

### Military and Political Leaders Hold Meetings for Days, Clearing the Gloom and Hoping for a Brighter Future, Representatives of the Senate Will Go Out of the City to Negotiate Peace with the Communist Side

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 16th] After the news from Tianjin reached Beiping, people's moods returned to calm after a series of excitements. Last night, the moonlight was like water, and the suburbs were silent. In the silence, Beiping seemed to be waiting for a new opportunity. There have been important meetings in Zhongnanhai for days, with all senior military and political leaders participating. Well-informed sources revealed that the situation in North China is expected to become clear in the short term. He Siyuan also told reporters that the situation in Beiping may not be the same as in Tianjin. After the North China Peace Promotion Association decided to establish yesterday, it recommended five representatives, including Ma Zhenyuan, to visit Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi to state their desire for peace and express their intention to go out of the city to appeal to the Communist side. Deputy Secretary-General Jiao Shiqi received them instead, and Jiao praised the enthusiasm for peace of the various popular organizations, saying, "You can do whatever you want." He also promised to assist in handling the procedures for leaving the city. This afternoon, the conveners of the Peace Promotion Association plan to invite famous figures from the academic community to participate in the association and jointly appeal to leave the city.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 16th, 9:20 PM] The speakers of the senates of the seven provinces and cities in North China have been working for peace all day today. They held a meeting and decided to send representatives out of the city to negotiate peace with the Communist side, carrying a peace plan. At noon, they jointly hosted a banquet for more than 30 military and political leaders, corps commanders, military commanders, mayors, university presidents, celebrities, vice-speakers of various senates, and He Siyuan in Beiping to exchange peace opinions. It is heard that if there are no additional problems, the seven speakers will send representatives out of the city tomorrow and issue a telegram calling for a local ceasefire in North China.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 16th] According to the evening newspaper, the ancient capital has revealed a glimmer of peace. The seven provincial and municipal senates of North China will issue an announcement in the coming days calling for peace, protecting the integrity of the construction of Beiping, and the safety of the people. This is the result of the active efforts of peace advocates in the area for the past two days after the end of the Tianjin campaign. The ancient city, which has been in a gloom for more than a month, is expected to be clear in the shortest possible time. The evening newspaper further revealed that peace advocates have penetrated the relevant authorities with this difficult problem of peace and the protection of Beiping and have obtained concrete answers.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 16th] Well-informed sources say: According to official sources, the Communist army in Tianjin has been called back to the suburbs of Beiping, and there may be major developments in the war situation here in the coming days. Wanshou Temple outside Xizhimen, Tuchengzi outside Deshengmen, and Guang'anmen were once shelled this morning, but quickly subsided.

[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 16th] It was learned today that Communist Army Commander Lin Biao has demanded the surrender of the garrison in Beiping. Although no deadline has been set, it will generally be before the 19th of this month. The issue of peace and war in the Beiping area is now awaiting a decision by Commander Fu Zuoyi.

Political circles here predict today that Commander Fu Zuoyi will issue a series of important statements on the current situation in the coming days. Although all levels here hope for peace, they are also preparing for a city defense war to prevent the worst. According to Xinmin Daily today, Commander Fu Zuoyi is extremely willing to obey the public will and implement a ceasefire, but he believes that peace must be national. He deeply believes that the Communist army in the Beiping area will not be satisfied unless the national army surrenders unconditionally, so local ceasefire is difficult to achieve before national peace is achieved.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] Foreign military observers here believe that the editorial in the Beiping Daily yesterday is sufficient to represent Fu Zuoyi's own views, that is, if the Communist army is willing to make slight concessions and prepare to implement local peace talks in the Beiping area. In other words, if the CCP allows part of the 125,000-strong army commanded by Fu to retreat to Suiyuan, he will order his troops to stop resisting.

[United Press Beiping Dispatch, 16th] A United Press reporter accompanied Chu Xichun, chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, out of the city today to inspect the positions of the national army. He saw the national army digging trenches, building artillery positions, blocking roads, and rushing to build other defensive works to prevent the worst. Then, at the top of an artillery position one mile from Guang'anmen, Chu pointed to a village half a mile away, saying that it was the forward哨 of the Communist army. The national army's food and accommodation are very simple. Except for uniforms, washbasins, towels, and soap, there is nothing else. Occasionally there is toothpaste for brushing. The Communist army around Beiping has a total of about six columns, totaling 90,000 people. Two columns belong to Lin Biao's command, and the other four columns belong to Nie Rongzhen's command. It is rumored that the Communist side has transferred reinforcements from the Tianjin area and completely controls the Tianjin to Fengtai section of the Pingjin Railway.

[Central News Agency Beiping Dispatch, 16th] The air transport of food to this city has not been realized due to the repair of the airport runway, and the city is in urgent need of food. Mayor Liu telegraphed the Shanghai Food Emergency Storage Association on the 16th, requesting that airplanes be used for temporary airdrops to facilitate the food supply before the airport is repaired.

[Central News Agency Beiping Dispatch, 16th] The speakers of the senates of the seven provinces and cities in North China hosted a banquet at the Municipal Senate at 12:00 noon today to entertain senior commanders of the various units of the National Army to express their condolences, and invited Mayor Liu Yaozhang and others to accompany them.

### Armored Units Garrisoned Near the Capital Reviewed by the President Yesterday, Leading Officers and Soldiers in Reverent Visit to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] This morning, President Chiang Kai-shek reviewed the armored units of Zhao Xia and Que Hanqian, garrisoned in the capital area, as well as the gendarmerie and police units of Beijing at Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. The President arrived at 9:30 AM, accompanied by Chief of General Staff Gu Zhutong, Commander-in-Chief of the Jinghu Garrison Tang Enbo, and Commander-in-Chief of the Capital Garrison Zhang Yaoming, and immediately changed to an open car to inspect the various units, first the armored units, gendarmerie, and police, followed by the Zhao Xia and Que Hanqian units. The units were all neatly dressed and full of spirit. When the President drove by, they stood at attention and saluted, shouting slogans. The President was quite satisfied with the neat military appearance of the various units. After the inspection lasted an hour, the President went to the Christ Victory Hall for worship. At 12:15 PM, he led all the officers and soldiers participating in the review in a reverent visit to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. At 12:30 PM, in front of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit hall, the President led all the officers and soldiers in reciting the twelve articles of the New Soldier's Reading Instructions. The ceremony was completed at 12:45 PM. The President then walked to the ranks of Que Hanqian's troops for a week before returning to the official residence.

### Legislators Remaining in the Capital Write to Sun Ke, Hoping to Send Representatives for Peace Talks, National Representatives Also Issue Statements Presenting the Same Opinions

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] Many legislators remaining in the capital sent a letter to President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke on the 16th to express their attitude towards the current situation, hoping that the government would immediately appoint appropriate personnel to negotiate with the CCP and seek effective ways to promote peace in order to achieve peace. The letter was decided after several days of consultations among the members. The original text is as follows:

President Zhesheng,

With respect: After you took office as President of the Executive Yuan, you stated that the government would strive for honorable peace. Therefore, although the Executive Yuan's policy guidelines have not yet been submitted until the eve of this month's recess, we still understand and place high expectations on them. At the beginning of this year, the President issued a clear statement on peace, even at the expense of his personal position, in order to achieve his sincerity in seeking peace, which is admired by China and foreign countries. Now the Communist Party has responded to the President's proposal, expressing its willingness to negotiate peace with the government, which is indeed an appropriate time to achieve peace. For several years, the people of the whole country have suffered from war, in deep waters and hot fires, a tragic situation. The nation's vitality has been exhausted, and the international status that the people of the whole country exchanged with blood and flesh during the War of Resistance has plummeted. If we do not stop fighting immediately, no matter who wins the war, the country and the nation will be in a state of utter ruin. We believe that the government should make a decision with great wisdom and courage to immediately appoint appropriate personnel to contact the Communist Party, urge them to agree to an immediate ceasefire, start negotiations, and continue to seek effective ways to promote peace, without any delay or hesitation, so as to prevent any more families from suffering from war. If the peace that the people of the whole country are seeking can be achieved soon, we are willing to make any sacrifice to promote its success. Because the Legislative Yuan is currently in recess, we cannot hold meetings for discussion. We have repeatedly received letters from various places, and their views are the same. Therefore, we dare to contribute our humble opinions. The situation is urgent. We hope for your wise decision.

Legislators remaining in the capital: Zhang Jingyu, Lu Yuwen, Wu Hexuan, Wang Qijiang, Cheng Siyuan, Yin Shuxian, Fan Yusui, Chen Bosheng, Gan Jiaxin, Xu Zhongyue, Zhu Zifan, Wu Jianping, Fan Yuansheng, Ding Chengfang, Li Yinwu, Huang Tong, Huang Yuren, Zhou Jieren, Zhang Renmin, Kong Lingcan, Wang Renyuan, Zhang Yueling, Sun Huixi, Li Hansan, Wei Yongcheng, Cui Jingbo, Qiu Changwei, Pan Weifang, Du Gouruo, Liu Cifeng, Wang Hongshao, Song Shuqiao, Huang Mengfei, Chen Jiujing, Niu Jinlu, Liu Zhaoxun, Wang Xiaohua, Jia Weiqi, Zhang Jichun, Zhang Qianhua, Xi Zhenduo, Yi Bojian, Xu Baichuan, Hou Tindu, Wang Guangqing, Liu Butong, Zhou Nan, Zhou Tianxian, Rong Zhao, Wang Pengcheng, Jili Zhantai, Wang Changyu, Li Shijun, Zhang Jiuru, Peng Zhenhuan, Niu Jianchu.

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] National Representatives Yan Zezi, Yang Quesu, Yang Shenxiu, Chen Wei, Zhang Xiubai, Li Xianxi, Liu Hangxi, Zhang Shenwu, Zhong Dingwen, etc., gathered on the 16th to discuss the peace issue, initially exchanged views, and issued a statement, first stating that for ten years, wars have continued, the people have been living in misery, and the nation's vitality has been greatly damaged. Fortunately, President Chiang's New Year's Day message advocated peace, and Mao Zedong's broadcast responded, and peace has revealed a glimmer of dawn. Then, they put forward preliminary measures, calling on both sides to immediately cease military actions, stop verbal attacks, and immediately send representatives to negotiate. The statement stated: The five principles announced by President Chiang and the eight conditions stated by Mao Zedong have their differences, but their acceptance of the people's demands and their search for peaceful paths are the same. Both sides should immediately appoint responsible personnel to start contact and engage in consultation. The public opinion organs, people's organizations, intermediate parties, and social leaders that can truly represent the people should immediately form a third party to participate in it, so as to achieve the effect of supervision and mediation, so that this consultation can achieve satisfactory results under the supervision of the people of the whole country, so as to avoid repeating the mistakes of the past Political Consultative Conference.

[Another Dispatch] According to the spokesperson of the "National Policy Research Association of Professors of Various Universities in China," after the CCP put forward eight conditions for peace talks, no matter how far away they are, the door to peace has been opened and the future has revealed a glimmer of dawn. At present, we only hope that both sides will value the survival of the country and the lives of the people, immediately cease fire, and conduct effective peace negotiations. It also stated that the association is deeply willing to promote the early realization of peace talks and has initiated the "Peace Promotion Association." After days of separate contacts, dozens of units have joined, and it will be established in the coming days to discuss concrete measures to shorten the distance between the two sides in order to achieve the ardent hopes of the people of the whole country.

### Cheng Qian Expresses His Opinion on the Eight Conditions of the Communist Party Yesterday

[Central News Agency Changsha Dispatch, 16th] Cheng Qian, who also serves as chairman, recently expressed his personal views on the eight conditions of the Communist Party, stating: "This is a difficult problem deliberately created by the Communist Party, which shows that they have no remorse and no sincerity in peace talks, and it is impossible to get close to them for a while. The Communist Party aims to seize power by force in order to carry out its conspiracy to destroy my country's five thousand years of history. We certainly hope for peace, but it seems that we must carefully consider paying such a heavy price."

### The National Army in Bengbu Automatically Withdraws, Li Yannian's Corps Headquarters Moves South

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] It is learned that after the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters was abolished, the national army in Bengbu adjusted its deployment and automatically withdrew on the 16th according to the planned plan. Li Yannian's corps headquarters also moved south to facilitate the command of military affairs south of Bengbu. The Jinpu Railway is being dismantled, but there were still cars heading north from Pukou on the morning of the 16th. Telecommunications between Nanjing and Bengbu were still open on the 16th.

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] It was learned today that after the national army withdrew from Bengbu on the Huai River Line, it has concentrated in Chuxian, thirty miles north of here. It is heard that the national army in Huaiyuan to the west of Bengbu and Linhuai Pass to the east has also mostly withdrawn, with only a small number of troops stationed by the Sixth Corps left to guard. However, the latter statement has not yet been confirmed by the official. The national army on the north bank of the Yangtze River is now deploying a new defense line in Chuxian, with a total strength of about 60,000 people.

### The U.S. Marine Corps in Qingdao All Boarded Ships and Left Qingdao

[Our Qingdao Dispatch, 16th] On the 16th, all the U.S. Marine Corps boarded ships and left Qingdao, leaving more than a hundred people to guard the warehouse. Its navy did not leave the port, and the severance pay for Chinese employees was issued, but they did not leave their jobs. 110,000 tons of materials from the government's logistics department were ordered to be transported south in full within a month. Also, the racecourse in the city will be converted into an airport.

### There is Still No Way to Confirm the Four Countries' Reply

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] It is still impossible to confirm from any source here the rumor that one or several of the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and France have submitted a formal reply to the memorandum sent by our government. Officials from the embassies of the four countries all said that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be the most appropriate spokesperson on this matter, while officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs still replied to reporters with "I know nothing." A related source told reporters that Ambassador Stuart visited Foreign Minister Wu at his private residence on the evening of the 13th, and the British side also had contact with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 14th. The rumors about the reply may have originated from this. The source also hinted that the ambassadors of the United States and the United Kingdom may have discussed our government's memorandum according to the instructions of their governments, during which they may have explained the situation required for international mediation and the current good faith position of each country, but it is not known whether a formal reply was submitted. The general view is that the attitude of the Soviet Union is particularly noteworthy. People close to the embassies of one or several countries strongly agree with this view, but they are unwilling to admit that the submission of a reply by each country will fall behind the Soviet Union.

### Zhu Shaoliang Arrives in Beijing Upon Summons, Wang Lingji Flies From Chengdu to Chongqing to Discuss Defense, Central Government Decides to Increase the Number of Troops in Sichuan by Seven Armies and Twenty Divisions

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] Zhu Shaoliang, director of the Chongqing-Suiyuan Appeasement Office, arrived in Beijing by plane from Chongqing at 1:30 PM on the 16th upon the President's summons. Fan Songyao, chief of staff of the Appeasement Office, came on the same plane. Zhu originally planned to visit the President that day, but because the President convened a meeting of important members of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties at his official residence at 7:30 PM in the evening, he changed his visit to the 17th. On the evening of the 16th, Zhu attended a banquet hosted by Chief of General Staff Gu Zhutong and discussed for a long time.

[Our Chongqing Dispatch, 16th] Zhu Shaoliang received a telegram from the President in the afternoon of the 15th and flew to Beijing at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 16th with Chief of Staff Fan Songyao, Director of the Eighth Training Office and Commander of the 108th Army Luo Guangwen, and will return after staying in Beijing for several days.

### The Executive Yuan's Temporary Political Meeting Decided to Stop the Exchange of Gold and Silver Starting Today and to Issue Short-Term Gold Bonds Starting Next Month

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 16th] The cessation of the exchange of gold and silver will be implemented starting on the 17th. The government has also decided to issue short-term gold bonds in two tranches starting on February 1st, with a total value of 2 million market taels, purchased at the exchange rate of gold yuan certificates, and will repay the principal and interest in gold monthly within two years to replace the exchange of gold and silver. The Executive Yuan held a temporary political meeting on the morning of the 16th and passed the principles for issuing short-term gold bonds and the amendment to the short-term gold bonds regulations. At the same time, it was decided that (1) the Ministry of Finance should quickly formulate a plan for reorganizing the public bonds issued in the past, (2) the current method of exchanging gold and silver should be abolished, and (3) the issue of opening the stock exchange should be quickly discussed by the Ministries of Finance and Industry and Commerce. The source of funds for issuing short-term gold bonds is to use the gold in the treasury and the existing US aid, with full preparation so that those who hold gold yuan certificates still have the opportunity to exchange for cash. The benefits obtained are not much different from the current exchange method. At the beginning of the formulation of the method of issuing gold bonds, consultations were held with the responsible persons of the US Economic Cooperation Administration in China and the US Aid Utilization Committee before a decision was made, because the government announced in November last year the method of exchanging gold and silver for gold yuan certificates. Its main purpose is to restore the value of the currency and absorb floating capital, but the handling procedures are difficult and the national treasury suffers great losses, and the revenue and expenditure of the national budget for 38 years are seriously insufficient. The method of offsetting, in addition to stepping up the reorganization of tax revenue, the use of foreign aid, and the sale of materials, must use public debt policies to make up for it, and also collect the effect of encouraging savings and absorbing floating capital. When the case was submitted to the political meeting on the 16th, Finance Minister Xu Kan explained the draft clauses in detail. The discussion was extremely cautious, but only one clause was added to the issuing principles, the nominal amount of gold bonds, and the rest were passed without modification. (The Principles for Issuing Short-Term Gold Bonds and the Short-Term Gold Bonds Regulations are published on page two.)

### Tentative Solutions to Current Chinese Political Problems

— Li Chonghuai

The eight-year war of resistance against Japan was fraught with hardship. On the day of victory, compatriots across the country were filled with expectations that the suffering was over and good times would begin. Unexpectedly, as the flames of aggression subsided, the fires of civil war erupted again. For the past three years, the war zone has been spreading wider, with half the country falling into military conflict, and millions of people displaced and homeless. Even those not directly devastated by the war have indirectly suffered the hardships it has brought. If this continues, the water will become deeper and the fire hotter, and the people's suffering will be unimaginable!

Some argue that the only way to relieve the people from their distress is to stop the civil war, which is indeed a fundamental solution. However, few can offer appropriate methods to stop the civil war. If we only advocate for "ceasefire" as a solution to all problems without providing methods for "ceasefire," then our efforts will be in vain.

The reason why the ceasefire issue is more difficult to solve than any other issue is that "ceasefire" is a matter for both the KMT and the CCP, not just one side. Ceasefire methods must be acceptable to both parties under objective conditions. After more than a year of consideration, I boldly offer a solution to this problem, which may not "please" either the KMT or the CCP. However, I am confident that I have objectively considered the positions of both the KMT and the CCP in detail, and I also believe that what is said here may be what most compatriots across the country want to say but dare not say.

Any dispute involves two parties, A and B, and its ultimate outcome is no more than three paths: one is the surrender of party A, one is the surrender of party B, and one is reconciliation between the two parties. The result of the KMT-CCP war is also no more than these three paths. In other words, either the Communist Party overthrows the current government and seizes national power; or the Kuomintang eliminates the Communist Party and unifies China; or a ceasefire is reached under conditions agreed upon by both parties. We now need to compare the difficulty of these three paths.

First, let's talk about the possibility of the Communist Party overthrowing the government. Judging from the results of the past three years of war, the Communist Party has achieved far more than the government. The former can be said to have won successive victories, and most of the Northeast and North China have fallen into its hands. But from the perspective of general historical wars, the initial victory may be the foundation for a complete victory, but it does not necessarily guarantee the final victory. The course of World War II is a clear example. The government still holds most of the territories, and is constrained by international politics, I am afraid that the Communist Party cannot overthrow it in the short term.

Secondly, it is not easy for the government to try to eliminate the Communist Party. Before the War of Resistance, the government's military strength was far greater than it is today, and its reputation at home and abroad was also high. At that time, the Communist Party had a limited number of people and was confined to a small corner. After ten years of hard fighting, it still could not be eliminated. What's more, the Communist Party's power is growing and it has already occupied half of the country? It can be seen that the government cannot eliminate the Communist Party, and there is a reason why it cannot be eliminated.

Furthermore, it is questionable whether the people of the whole country are willing to be ruled by either party. The people who fled from the war zone praised the military and politics of the Communist Party, but why didn't they continue to stay in the Communist areas? This is a question that is worth studying. It is a fact that general public opinion is dissatisfied with the government, and it is also a fact that some people hope that the Communist Party will be in power, but it is unlikely that most people would abandon the government and embrace the Communist Party. The advantages and weaknesses of the National Government are well known, but the advantages and weaknesses of the Communist Party are very vague. The National Party's politics is declining day by day, which is indeed painful for the people, but its achievements in the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance should not be forgotten by the people for a while. Objectively speaking, some of our people hope that the Communist Party will be in power, and some people still support the current government; and it is not easy to know the attitude of the majority of the people, but it can be asserted that they will never fully support one side.

In summary, it is not easy for either the KMT or the CCP to defeat the other by force in the short term, and it is even more impossible in fact to ask either party to surrender unconditionally. If the war continues, it will naturally be resolved sooner or later, but the longer the war lasts, the deeper the people's suffering will be. Perhaps our country will be involved in the catastrophe of the Third World War as a result, and the future of China will be even more unimaginable.

In order to avoid the continued delay of the war and to relieve the people from the suffering of the war, it seems that there is only a third way to go, which is reconciliation.

Reconciliation is not easy, but if objective conditions are met, it is not more difficult than the previous two paths. There are also two ways to reconcile: one is to form a coalition government, and the other is to implement a north-south division. The former has been discussed many times after the victory, but it has never been successful. The reasons are obvious: first, both the KMT and the CCP have troops, and no one is willing to hand over military power to the other; second, the political systems of the KMT and the CCP are fundamentally different, and it is extremely difficult to merge them into one; third, the KMT-CCP dispute has lasted for 20 years, and the hatred is very deep. Even if they reluctantly share power, they will inevitably be at odds with each other, harbor suspicion, and eventually have infighting. Therefore, it is feared that the difficulty of resolving internal disputes by establishing a coalition government is no less than resolving them by force.

I believe that a more feasible path to reconciliation is the north-south division. Now, let's provide the principles of division as follows:

(1) The national system of the Republic of China will not be changed, but within the national territory, the KMT and the CCP can agree on a boundary to divide the country into two parts, the north and the south. The northern part will be governed by an autonomous government established by the Communist Party, and the southern part will still be governed by the existing government.

(2) The Communist Party Autonomous Government in the north shall enjoy autonomy over legislation, administration, judiciary, and military affairs within its region, and shall have its own constitution, but shall still be a part of the Republic of China. The northern government shall obtain the consent of the southern government to send representatives abroad and enter into treaties, as the southern government is still recognized by all countries. Other than that, the northern government is not subject to any constraints from the southern government. The relationship between the north and south governments is like the relationship between the early British Empire and its autonomous territories.

(3) Both parties agree that the people and property of either party have the right to move to the other party at any time. Neither party shall hinder in any way, except by completing the legal passage formalities in the simplest manner.

(4) Troops and all directly affiliated institutions of both parties crossing the border shall be withdrawn to their respective political territories within a time limit.

(5) Both parties shall periodically discuss positions in accordance with the above principles and sign an agreement for joint compliance. This agreement may also be witnessed by friendly countries related to Far Eastern politics upon invitation by both parties, or the United Nations may be invited to send personnel to supervise the implementation.

If the above basic principles are agreed upon by both parties, the details and implementation methods will not be difficult to resolve.

Once the north-south division is implemented, it will give both the KMT and the CCP the opportunity to win the people's confidence with their achievements, and it will also allow the people to choose the government that they believe is good. Ceasefire and peaceful political struggle are the unanimous demands of the people. If one party disregards this demand of the people, it will be abandoned by the people. If one party takes the lead in agreeing to this proposal, it will not only show its determination to care for the people and sacrifice its own interests, but will also increase the people's love for it. What to do is very clear. (Continued on page 4)

Whether a Third World War Can Be Avoided Depends on Stopping the War in China

The letter stated: "If China becomes red, the Soviet Union and its vassals can launch a third world war in Europe at will. The Communist Party will proceed according to this pre-planned plan. If the Chinese Communists who echo them seize power in China, they will definitely have something to do in Europe. I firmly believe that the avoidance of worldwide war depends on the cessation of the war in China, because the Communist Party must shroud the Asian continent in an iron curtain before carrying out its invasion of Europe, because the Soviet Union will never fight on two fronts. It seems that the leaders in Washington have no ability to realize these things."

### Widespread Rumor that Britain Will Initiate Organization of a Pacific Common Alliance, Inviting Relevant Countries to Hold a Meeting in Singapore, Britain and France Agree on Common Far East Policy

[Agence France-Presse, London, 15th] According to today's "Star" newspaper, the British government is currently considering a proposal to convene a conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Netherlands to determine a common policy for each country in the Far East to contain communist forces. The meeting may be held in Singapore, and Siam and Burma will also be invited to participate. British officials have not commented on this news. According to official announcements, Britain and France are expected to issue a joint statement soon, declaring the common attitude of Britain and France towards various Far East issues. It is reported that the Far East issue was also discussed at the meeting of the British and French foreign ministers held this week.

[Associated Press, London, 15th] According to reliable sources, one of the actions of Western countries in the Cold War against communism may be to conclude a Far East regional treaty to prevent the expansion of communist forces. Although not officially confirmed, this plan has apparently progressed to the point of mutual consultation. The initial participants will be the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France, the Netherlands, China, and India. Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaya may also join the treaty if they can establish stable governments. This proposal was the basis for British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Schuman to discuss Far East mutual assistance issues this week. Although the content is kept secret, it is said that Bevin strongly stated that Britain believes that the independence movements of Far East nations should be encouraged by democratic countries, but the national movements he referred to do not mean those incited by the Communist Party under the guidance of the Soviet Union. The establishment of a Far East defense treaty is consistent with Bevin's recent declaration in the House of Commons. The United States has also adopted the same line, as evidenced by its current negotiations with Canada and Western European countries to conclude the North Atlantic defense treaty. The main reason for the British-French conference is probably this. In the communiqué issued on the 14th, it was strongly stated that cooperation between the two countries in Europe should be extended to the East.

[Associated Press, Washington, 15th] News from London indicates that the British and French foreign ministers have studied the possibility of establishing a vast anti-communist bloc in Southeast Asia. Considerable attention is being paid to this news here. However, officials informally stated that they have not heard of any concrete plans for a Southeast Asian alliance. The State Department seems to insist that the United States should not expand its unfulfillable responsibilities. Washington is temporarily focusing its efforts on completing the North Atlantic Treaty to defend Western Europe.

### China, Siam, Lebanon and Fifteen Other Countries Decide to Attend the Asian Conference, Opinions on Sanctioning the Netherlands Still Differ

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 16th] It is reported that the Chinese government has instructed Luo Jialun, its ambassador to India, to be an observer for China at the upcoming Asian Conference. So far, only China and New Zealand have sent observers. The conference will last for three days, and may be extended if necessary. Representatives of the Republic of Indonesia and the Dutch government will both submit memorandums to the conference. It is reported that when Indian Prime Minister Nehru invited Asian countries to the meeting, he had Article 52 of Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter in mind, but Indian officials stated that this meeting is a "regional conference."

[United Press, New Delhi, 15th] Diplomatic sources said on the 15th that the Asian countries' conference on the Indonesian issue, which will open here on the 20th, will reconcile two divergent plans, one for dealing with the Netherlands outside the United Nations, and the other for demanding that the Security Council sanction the Netherlands. It is reported that the first plan to pressure the Netherlands to cease action in Indonesia is sponsored by Afghanistan and Burma. The plan calls for direct sanctions against the Netherlands and assisting Indonesia on a regional basis without obtaining United Nations approval. On the other hand, India, China, the Philippines and other participating countries are expected to insist that the Security Council cannot be bypassed, and that the conference can only condemn the Netherlands and demand that the Security Council implement sanctions. Indonesia's proposal calls for the direct application of economic sanctions, severing diplomatic relations, and providing material assistance to Indonesia. These officials also announced that they had received acceptance invitations from fourteen countries: Afghanistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, China, Burma, Nepal, Pakistan, Ceylon, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Philippines, and New Zealand, but New Zealand will only send one observer. Turkey declined the invitation, and Yemen has not yet replied.

[Associated Press, New Delhi, 16th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that Siam has decided to participate in the Southeast Asian Conference held in New Delhi to discuss the Indonesian issue.

[Agence France-Presse, Beirut, 15th] Lebanon has decided to participate in the Pan-Asian Congress in New Delhi, and its representative will be Hai Mat, the Director of the Political Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

### US Secretary of the Navy Submits Report to the President, Suggests Navy Modernization, Requires Huge Funds to Build a Fleet of Unmanned Aircraft and Submarines

[United Press, Washington, 16th] In his annual report to President Truman today, US Secretary of the Navy Sullivan requested that billions of dollars be allocated to build a fleet of rocket ships, unmanned aircraft, and submarines in order to ensure victory in the next war. The Navy's plan is now based on the doctrine that "future naval warfare will take place in the sky and underwater, and the number of underwater wars will be equal to the number of surface wars."

Sullivan said that if the US Navy wants to be prepared in time, it will need more than the $4.3 billion allocated to the Navy in Truman's proposed new budget. The President evenly distributes military spending among the Army, Navy, and Air Force, but Sullivan pointed out that the Navy believes that its share is too small. He also said that the Navy is now spending millions of dollars building a fleet of unmanned aircraft to be launched from airplanes and ships. He said that three experimental submarines are under construction, which can be used as "submarine executioners."

[Associated Press, Rhodes Island, 16th] The United Nations is trying to bring four other Arab countries into the Holy Land truce negotiations between Egypt and Israel. While representatives of Egypt and Israel were discussing important issues such as the surrounded Egyptian troops in Faluja and the demarcation of the truce line, Mediator Bunche suggested expanding the basis for resolving the Holy Land issue.

If they can be resolved, peace can be achieved. It is reported that Israel will allow the withdrawal of the Egyptian troops surrounding Faluja as an exchange condition for requiring Egypt to make concessions in the demarcation of the truce line. There is no indication whether Egypt will agree.

More than 100 public halls in Tel Aviv were borrowed five times last weekend, as the election campaign is approaching the polling day on the 25th. On the 25th, 140,000 Jews and 32,000 Arabs will vote to determine the 120 seats in Parliament, which is the same number of seats as in the Jewish National Assembly before the 20th century. Voters must choose the entire list of a certain party, but each party mostly uses the prestige of its leaders and candidates to win votes. In this melting pot of the Jewish world, campaign appeals are issued in Hebrew, New Jewish, English, Polish, Russian, Hungarian, Bulgarian, German, Spanish, and Arabic.

### Night Exercise Simulates Street Fighting, Suzhou River Blocks Enemy from Crossing North, Racecourse Suppresses Riot, North Station Fails to Stage Incident

[Our Report] The Special Service Battalion of the Garrison Command held a street fighting exercise yesterday, originally scheduled to start at 10 am and end at 2 pm. Temporarily, fearing that it would cut off traffic during the day and cause inconvenience, it was changed to after 10 pm. The exercise procedures were: (1) Guarding duties at key intersections near the headquarters; (2) Assuming that there were sporadic enemies on the south bank of the Suzhou River and the Bund attempting to cross the river, the National Army was ordered to search and guard; (3) Assuming that there were bandits lurking in the racecourse, intending to riot, the National Army was ordered to suppress them; (4) Assuming that the enemy forces attacked the North Station along the Beijing-Shanghai Line, the National Army received a report and rushed to repel them. (Because of time constraints, the fourth item was not completed.) The participants in the exercise were the first infantry company of the Special Service Battalion, a platoon of the fourth armored vehicle battalion, a total of more than 100 people, and five armored vehicles. Huang Chongwu, the deputy battalion commander of the Special Service Battalion, served as the company commander in charge of command during the exercise. Senior Advisor Shen Xiaofeng and Special Service Battalion Commander Zheng Yuanzhao served as instructors.

At the beginning of the exercise, soldiers gathered in the Garrison Department Square, and the instructors and commanders gave instructions on the main points one after another, and then immediately started the first procedure, sending a part of the soldiers to deploy defense and guard at key intersections such as Jiangwan Road, North Sichuan Road, and Shanyin Road around the Garrison Department. At 10:30, five armored vehicles drove out of the Garrison Department gate in a mighty manner, followed closely by two six-wheeled trucks carrying infantry, along North Sichuan Road to Sichuan Road Bridge. Discovering that the enemy was attempting to cross the river on the south bank of the Suzhou River, the armored vehicles turned into Suzhou Road and spread along the river between Sichuan Road Bridge and Waibaidu Bridge, opening fire. At the same time, the infantry got off the truck at the foot of Sichuan Road Bridge, divided into columns and ran to the river bank, using iron railings and stone piers as cover, either lying down or kneeling down to shoot fiercely at the south bank and the river. For a time, the sound of gunfire (all bullets had been removed from the caps) was continuous, and the situation was very realistic and tense. The boatmen in the Suzhou River were awakened by the sound of gunfire, and their commotion could be vaguely seen from the shore. Foreign residents living in Broadway Mansion also looked out the windows. After about half an hour of such exercise, the instructor went back and forth to give instructions, and Garrison Commander Chen Daqing also drove to inspect. By 11:30, the enemy on the south bank had been wiped out. Then, they went to the racecourse to suppress the riot. Armored vehicles and infantry trucks crossed Waibaidu Bridge and went through the Bund into Nanjing Road. They surrounded the racecourse on two routes at New World. One part ran south to Xizang Road to outflank the racecourse, and the other part continued west to Nanjing Road and turned into Mahuo Road to encircle them. The tanks patrolled around to guard, and the infantry was distributed around the racecourse to the battle strongholds on the road, completing the arrangement to suppress and prevent riots. It was already 12:15 midnight. The instructor thought it was too late, and the final coordinated attack on the North Station in the exercise procedure was decided to be stopped. The tanks and infantry then withdrew to the Garrison Department under the bright moonlight.

### Garrison Commander Receives Reporters Yesterday, Hopes Citizens Will be Calm, Resolutely Prohibits Strikes and Go-Slows, Troops Temporarily Staying in a Small Number of Schools is Temporary in Nature

Chen Daqing, Garrison Commander of Songhu, gave a speech at the reception for reporters at 2 pm yesterday, stating that the purpose of maintaining law and order is to "seek stability" and "prevent chaos." Stability is the common need of all citizens. Under any circumstances, he hoped that people would be calm and that chaos would never be a blessing for the citizens. Chen said that before the publication of the cost of living index for the first half of this month, several labor-capital disputes had occurred in the city. Currently, on this issue, on the labor-capital side, labor-capital disputes are prone to occur because of the approaching Lunar New Year. From the standpoint of law and order agencies, this issue is extremely important because it is currently the winter defense period. He said that it is almost impossible to fundamentally resolve labor-capital disputes at this stage. However, he hopes that both labor and capital will seek a solution under the principles and spirit of being reasonable, realistic, and mutually understanding, so as not to affect social order. However, if strikes, go-slows, and other behaviors occur, they are not allowed by martial law, and the Garrison Department will resolutely prohibit them.

Chen continued to talk about the city's security measures: (1) The construction of suburban fortifications is actively underway, and the basic fortifications can be completed before the end of this month. Regarding the materials for constructing the fortifications, such as yellow sand, gravel, and materials, in order to save time, those that have not been transported to Shanghai will be temporarily purchased or borrowed from those in the city who store these materials. The Material Procurement Committee under the Shanghai Municipal Fortification Construction Committee (the chairman of the committee is Du Yuesheng) will pay for or issue a IOU to borrow them, and return them on a regular basis. (2) Recently, a small number of schools have been temporarily occupied by troops after they have closed for vacation. This is temporary in nature and will definitely not hinder the recruitment and opening of the schools. (3) From the 15th, the martial law time outside the mouth of Wusong is from 6 pm to 6 am the next morning. The martial law time on the Huangpu River will be determined in sections according to the traffic density. In principle, it will be coordinated with the martial law time on land. (4) The street fighting exercise was originally scheduled to be held from 10 am to 2 pm on the 16th, but was later changed to 10 pm to 2 am on the 17th. The participants in the exercise were one company of the Special Service Battalion of the Garrison Department and several armored vehicles.

### Shanghai Speaker Replies to Henan Speaker by Telegram to Discuss Peace

Pan Gongzhan, Speaker of the Shanghai Municipal Council, replied to a telegram from Speaker Liu of Henan Province yesterday, which read, "Respectfully received telegram from Speaker Liu of Henan Provincial Council in Xinyang, Your Excellency. Since the President's New Year's Day speech has advocated peace, and Mr. Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party, although his statement on the current situation lists eight items that are close to harsh, we should still regard them as the final lament for the sake of the people's suffering and seek tolerance from both sides. This council's telegram suggests that the National Peace Promotion Association should be convened in Shanghai, which I believe you will understand. I hope that you will come to Shanghai as soon as possible to discuss and appeal together. Your brother, Pan Gongzhan, bows, Zi, Xiao."

Unexpectedly, Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party broadcast a statement yesterday, publishing the so-called eight conditions, making the hope for peace that the people of the whole country unanimously yearn for dim again. He still hopes that the compatriots of the whole country will continue to appeal, so that the Chinese Communist Party will accept public opinion and cease fire on the spot, and at the same time should raise vigilance and not forget the war because of the peace talks.

### Resumption of Stock Exchange Awaits Study, Some Employees Have Been Dismissed

[Our Report] It was reported yesterday that after the Ministry of Finance and Industry decided to suspend the exchange of gold and silver, it would also study the resumption of business of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The reporter asked the spokesperson of the exchange for details yesterday. According to the statement, the stock exchange has not yet received a notice from the authorities to resume operations, so there are no preparations at present. Since the order to suspend operations last year, the stock exchange has never submitted a request to the authorities to resume operations, but it has mostly been the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Council, and other social groups that telegraphed to request approval to resume operations. However, the authorities telegraphed back to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce several weeks ago, clarifying that the resumption of operations should be "temporarily postponed."

In addition, due to the uncertain resumption of operations, the employees of the stock exchange were given severance pay at the end of last year and dismissed. The number of those who accepted severance pay has reached one-third.

### Zhongxing Road Shantytown Fire: Public Works Bureau Investigates the Situation

Shaoxing Native Association Distributes Relief Funds

Houses in the Zhongxing Road area of Zhabei suffered an unprecedented fire on the sixth of this month. For fire safety, the Municipal Public Works Bureau, together with the police局, dispatched personnel to investigate the actual situation of the fire. It is understood that the fire was caused by the simple structure of the houses, most of which were makeshift buildings. In addition, there were no fire hydrants nearby, and the water supply was insufficient, so rescue efforts were delayed. It is reported that the Public Works Bureau has ordered the relevant public works management office and suggested that the police局 stop the unauthorized repair of houses after the fire. It also instructed the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to add fire hydrants to various routes in Zhabei as needed.

In addition, the disaster-stricken refugees from the Shaoxing area have been appealing for relief to the Shaoxing Seven Counties Shanghai Native Association. The association, recognizing their hunger and cold and the pitiable nature of their situation, immediately began registration and convened a meeting of the standing directors and supervisors to discuss relief measures. It was decided that the directors and supervisors would donate funds and distribute relief funds of 500 yuan per person to the affected fellow villagers, which would be distributed separately today.

### Pope Donates 500,000 Yuan to Aid China Anti-Tuberculosis Association

Wu Shao-qing, Director-General of the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association, told reporters yesterday that Pope Pius XII of Rome recently donated 500,000 yuan in gold yuan to the China Anti-Tuberculosis Association. Archbishop Libero, the Papal Nuncio to China, has notified Mr. Wu of this intention, stating that the funds have already been transferred to the Catholic Welfare Association for delivery to the association. It is estimated that three Chinese people die of tuberculosis every minute, and approximately 20 million Chinese people suffer from tuberculosis, while hospitals nationwide only have 3,000 beds available for tuberculosis patients. The China Anti-Tuberculosis Association was established a year ago and has since established 18 branches in cities across the country, setting up tuberculosis clinics, distributing anti-tuberculosis pamphlets in different areas, and conducting group lung screenings and treating patients. Mr. Wu believes that the Pope's donation is a great assistance to our anti-tuberculosis work.

### Luban Road, Nanshi: Three Robbers Raid Rice Shop, Open Fire, Four Casualties, All Escape

[Our Newspaper Report] Luban Road Nantangbang in Nanshi, at the intersection of Songshan, Lujiawan, and Penglai three districts, a robbery resulting in bloodshed occurred last night, with as many as four people killed or injured. As a result, the robbers calmly escaped after firing shots to intimidate. Lin Zhengxing Rice Shop is located at No. 1 Longxingfang in the area. The shop owner, Lin Lixian, is 49 years old and from Taizhou. The shop was busy selling household rationed rice until late last night. As the shop owner was settling accounts at around 7 p.m., three robbers carrying weapons suddenly rushed in. All spoke with a Northern Jiangsu accent, one wearing a blue cloth long gown, one wearing a short overcoat, and the other wearing a short shirt and shorts. First, they forced the shop owner, his wife, and their young clerk to hand over the four gold rings they were wearing. At the same time, they stole 16,000 yuan in cash and a bundle of household rationed rice tickets, and rushed out the door. Seeing this, the shop owner's wife chased after them, intending to retrieve the household rationed rice tickets. Unexpectedly, the robbers, feeling guilty, immediately pulled out a gun and fired. The wife quickly dodged, but the bullet accidentally hit the shop owner's right leg. At this point, the wife screamed wildly, and the three robbers fled in haste. When they escaped to Xietu Road, Zeng Sibao, a worker at Universal Glue Factory, happened to be coming towards them. The robbers mistook him for someone coming to catch them and fired a shot at Zeng, hitting him in the head. At this point, the three robbers became even more flustered and fired randomly along the way. As a result, two rickshaw pullers, Ji Weiying and Shao Guilin, were also hit and injured. The former was shot in the waist, and his injuries were serious. The latter was shot in the right foot, and his injuries were not serious. As for Zeng Sibao, he died on the way to the hospital because he was shot in the head. The three robbers ultimately escaped without hindrance.

### Tentative Solution to the Current Political Problems in China Continued from Page Two

As for whether China can have a longer period of peace after the Kuomintang and the Communist Party implement North-South division, it still requires the efforts of all compatriots and leaders of both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. If both sides continue to go to extremes, war may still be inevitable in the future; if both sides can move in the same direction, it will not be difficult to merge into one in the future. To adapt to the requirements of the times, the author would like to attach a few basic principles, hoping that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can move forward accordingly:

(1) Freedom and equality are inherent rights of mankind. Any kind of politics must take the protection of the people's freedom and equality as its task. Because human beings are social animals, individual freedom must be coordinated with the freedom of others or groups. In other words, individual freedom may be restricted to avoid infringing or harming the freedom of others, but it does not necessarily have to be restricted if it does not hinder the freedom of others or groups. As for equality, it should include political equality and economic equality. The so-called political equality is that everyone has the right to vote and express their will. As for the meaning of economic equality, please refer to Section 6 below. Whether a political system is good or not depends on whether it can enable each member to have the average highest degree of freedom and reasonable equality.

(2) To achieve the above goals, the most ideal political system is naturally democratic politics. The so-called democratic politics is that all important measures are decided by the choice of the will of the majority of the people. The majority of the people may be foolish and blindly follow, and their decisions may be wrong from an objective point of view, but as long as the majority of the people subjectively satisfy their desires at that time, the ruling party should obey. Therefore, as a leader of democratic politics, one must have a high degree of patience and tolerance, must sacrifice one's own prejudices, and abandon the mentality of heroic self-esteem and arrogance.

(3) Since democratic politics is the politics of the masses, the speed of its progress depends entirely on the level of the masses' wisdom, that is, on the level of national education. Without a mass of people with considerable knowledge and education, it is not easy to have good democratic politics. Therefore, after the ceasefire, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should immediately implement national education. The cost of primary education for the people should be entirely borne by the state. This should at least be the touchstone of political competition between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

(4) The application of democratic politics is entrusted to multi-party politics. Because multi-party politics can produce the effects of competition, checks and balances, and metabolism. In other words: multi-party politics can enable the people to have the opportunity to choose. It is fundamentally not easy for one-party dictatorship to produce the will of democracy. This does not mean that one-party politics cannot have a good government. One-party politics may have a good and satisfactory government; but it may also produce an autocratic and violent government. The former is naturally welcomed by the people, but if the latter makes the people dissatisfied, they have no way to change it, unless through a bloody revolution. Therefore, one-party politics is theoretically an unstable system, which is easy to go to extremes.

(5) The army should be nationalized immediately. It is a matter of course that political parties in democratic countries should not have an army. In the future, I hope that the soldiers in active service can firmly adhere to the excellent style of "the army should not interfere in politics." If so, the Kuomintang's contribution to laying the foundation for the future civil rule of China will be eternally remembered and praised by all generations. After the Communist Party achieves autonomy, we also place the same hope on "the army being state-owned." If both parties can firmly adhere to the principles of multi-party politics and state-owned army, our civil war may be eliminated forever, and in the near future, there will still be an opportunity for the north and south to merge into one.

(6) Economy and politics are two sides of the same coin. The purpose of all human economic activities is nothing more than the satisfaction of consumption desires, that is, the improvement of living standards. It is easy to improve the living standards of individuals, but difficult to improve the living standards of the masses. A good ideal economic system is to generally improve the living standards of the masses. If we want to improve the living standards of the masses generally, we must consider two major principles: one is the increase in production, and the other is the rationalization of distribution. The method of increasing production lies in the full utilization of resources and the improvement of technology, but the most important factor in promoting industrialization is the concentration of capital. Capital concentration is nothing more than private capital concentration and state capital concentration. Whichever or both is acceptable, as long as the government clearly defines and firmly adheres to the boundaries between state-owned and private enterprises. The problem lies in the need to simultaneously coordinate with the second principle, which is the rationalization of distribution. The so-called rationalization of distribution is another explanation of economic equality. We know that absolute economic equality is impossible. Because each person's natural talent and physical strength are different, people's work contributions to society are different. If the price (that is, income) is completely equal, it will not encourage people to work hard and compete. In order for society to continue to progress, the difference in labor remuneration should exist, but it cannot be too large. In other words, the government should have maximum and minimum restrictions on the income of the people. With this kind of restriction, the phenomenon of extreme wealth and extreme poverty will not exist. Within this limit, people have ample opportunities for free competition. This limit can be larger in the early stage of economic development, and then gradually shortened with economic development. When the two limits are close, we will reach the ideal world of great communist harmony. The implementation of this income limit policy is not difficult. On the one hand, the minimum wage treatment is stipulated by law, and on the other hand, the progressive income tax law is strictly implemented, which can gradually achieve our goal. However, there is a central principle that must be followed in this ideal distribution system, that is, the system of "unearned income" should be abolished. For example, the inheritance system should not continue to exist. The author has always advocated that the inheritance system should be abolished immediately, and at the same time, the government should use all the confiscated inheritance as funds for national education. However, after the government promotes this method, it should also seek appropriate ways out for the unemployed, those who rely on inheritance for a living, and those who cannot support themselves. On this point, you can refer to the British social security system and formulate another plan.

(7) The foundation of our country lies in agriculture; more than 80% of the population is engaged in agriculture. Therefore, the land problem should be the central problem of our country's economic policy in the future. On the one hand, we should realize the ideal of "land to the tiller" as soon as possible, and organize self-cultivating farmers, promote cooperative farms and collective farm systems to seek the progress of agricultural technology and the increase in production. On the other hand, we should develop towards the virgin land in the border areas that has not been reclaimed, and at the same time, we should guide farmers to develop sideline businesses so that they can gradually embark on the road of industrialization and improve their living standards. It is best that each region should make planned and rational development according to its economic characteristics, and compete with each other for their achievements.

(8) The above is about the future political and economic system. Education is the foundation of a country and should not be ignored. Our past education policy was a big failure. One is that various parties used students as political tools, and the other is that the government has no clear policy for education at all. In the future, both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party should adopt the following policies as the guiding principles for education: (1) All parties withdraw from schools and no longer use students as tools for political struggle. (2) The cost of basic education received by the people is entirely borne by the state. (3) Secondary education should focus on vocational and technical training. (4) University and graduate education should adopt a key system, that is, select a few excellent schools and develop their faculty and equipment as much as possible. (5) Outside of schools, more attention should be paid to mass education. People's assembly halls should be widely established in various places to encourage people to gather frequently to remedy the current society in our country where individualism is too developed.

The above eight items are roughly the conditions that a good political system should have. If both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party can earnestly move towards this goal, it will not be difficult to get closer and lead China to an ideal state of prosperity, strength, health, and happiness together. (The End)

### Malnutrition Causes Many Diseases: Privately Run Children's Institutions Hope Supply Stations Increase Quality and Quantity

[Our Newspaper Report] According to news from children's institutions in this city, the recent drastic fluctuations in prices have made it impossible for general privately run children's institutions to maintain themselves, resulting in malnutrition and various diseases among children. The Shanghai District Children's Emergency Work Review Committee's Dietary Supply Station provides a small quantity and quality of supplies to various children's institutions, with only 3.2 liang of white rice, 3 qian of soybeans, 3 qian of butter, 1 qian of salt, 4 liang of vegetables (distributed according to the price-limited vegetable of 5 jiao per jin), and half a jin of firewood per person per day (one-quarter deducted for 100 or more people). The above quantity is difficult to fill the children's stomachs, and the transportation costs must be borne by the institutions themselves. The meat and eggs that were previously decided to be supplied have not yet been realized. Now, various institutions are overwhelmed and hope that the association can increase the supply quantity and improve the supply methods to help the children's institutions in this city tide over the difficulties together.

### Yiyuan Football Friendship Match: Jingwu Defeats China Aviation Yesterday: Losing One Goal First, Scoring Four in a Row

Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. at the Yiyuan Stadium, there was a football practice match between China Aviation and Jingwu. It was cold and the horses were fat, and the fighting spirit of both armies was very high, while less than a thousand people watched from the sidelines. As a result of the competition, Jingwu defeated China Aviation with a score of four to one.

Jingwu kicked off first, and Li Rongbang penetrated deep into the goal. China Aviation's Xu Fusheng caught Ah Dou and didn't make a mistake. China Aviation counterattacked, Gao Xiuqing came to the key point, and lightly passed to Xu Zuguo. Jingwu's Huang Lipu left a gap, and Gao Zhiwen rescued an empty goal. Zuguo shot it in, and China Aviation took the lead with one to zero. Jingwu was humiliated and attacked relentlessly, but the ball luck was not good. Zhao Baoli hooked it, and Zhuang Wenquan's attempt to resolve the situation failed. Li Rongbang attacked again and hit the goalpost. Half an hour passed, Jingwu's offensive revived, Zhao Baoli scouted the camp and shot forcefully but missed. Li Rongbang attacked again, penetrated deep into the enemy's formation, and took a horizontal sweep not far from the goal. Xu Fusheng failed to save it, and the ball went into the net. Jingwu tied the score, and the first half ended with one to one, with no clear winner.

After the break, the two armies fought again. Jingwu made major adjustments to the lineup, with changes in both the forwards and defenders. As expected, Jingwu's morale was greatly boosted, and the offensive surged. At 15 minutes, Jingwu's front line besieged urgently. China Aviation's Jin Chuanhan returned to rescue, but inadvertently caused a major disaster in the penalty area. Jingwu's Li Rongbang took the penalty kick from 12 yards and scored with one kick, and Jingwu took the lead with two to one. In less than two minutes, Jingwu's Li Rongbang attacked the goal again. Xu Fusheng扑救出 but it didn't go far, and Wang Guoguang happened to arrive and凑上another kick, and Xu Fusheng had no way to save it and lost another city, making it three to one. China Aviation was frustrated, morale turned 昻, and they attacked in turn, but Jingwu's defenders were 엄격, and China Aviation's strikers failed more than once, but it was futile. At 24 minutes, Li Rongbang led the three armies and rushed forward. Near the Jingwu gate, they raised their feet and shot immediately. Xu Fusheng撲救出, the same mistake again, the ball didn't fall far, Jingwu's right wing Fan Benjun caught up at a diagonal angle and kicked it in, and Jingwu defeated China Aviation with a score of four to one.

### Yunnan-Guizhou-Sichuan Border Security Situation (Part 1)

— Our Reporter Liu Mengchi

[Our Newspaper, Guiyang, 9th (Airmail)] The security and order of the Yunnan-Guizhou-Sichuan border area has always been less than ideal, but it can also be said that the problem has not yet become severe. There are roughly three evil forces endangering the security and order of the three-province border area: one is the Tusi (local chieftain), one is the Paoge (secret society), and one is the opium bandit. Any one of these three evil forces can disrupt the security and order of rural areas, let alone when some people combine all three into one. Added to this is the administrative officials' contempt for the law and collusion with these forces, which leads to all kinds of evil deeds and unforgivable crimes.

Without going too far back, recently Long Tengxiao, the Tusi of Pan County, Qianxi, local tyrant Xian Baliang, and Long Chengyao, a corrupt gentry from Zhenxiong, eastern Yunnan, colluded with Luo Renji, the county magistrate, to grow opium under armed protection, incite resistance to eradication, and secretly communicate with bandits from Junlian, southern Sichuan, and Yang Dizhong, the Tusi of Bijie, plotting illegal activities. Judging from various signs, although the authorities of the three provinces were able to prevent and suppress them early, fortunately preventing the situation from expanding, they still managed to maintain some residual power, frequently roaming the borders of the three provinces, which is enough to keep the Chongqing Pacification Headquarters, responsible for stabilizing the rear, constantly vigilant.

Long Tengxiao, the Tusi of the southern district of Pan County, is a retired military officer who graduated from the Yunnan Training Corps. He participated in the war against Japan with the 60th Army and later became a subordinate of the Communist bandit Zhang Chong. In the area of Pan County, Pingyi, Chengxin, and Zhenxiong, he has some latent power because he was stationed there for a long time. Knowing that the ignorant people on the Yunnan-Guizhou border are greedy for immediate gains, he used armed protection of opium cultivation as a slogan. In the bankrupt rural areas, taking advantage of the "three-no-man's-land" loophole at the border, he slowly expanded his power, using Nuozhai as his lair, recruiting soldiers and buying horses, seemingly building a small base. To prevent local chaos, gentry in Pan County requested that troops not be added until the government had determined to thoroughly suppress the area, and publicly recommended provincial senators Xie Taoran and five or six other representatives to go to Nuozhai to advise him to quickly rein in his actions. Unexpectedly, they were rejected, and he further contacted a corrupt gentry named Fu from Pingyi. Qian Baliang, a local tyrant from Pan County, was also intimidated by him and conspired with him. In mid-November, the Guizhou provincial government realized that this malignant sore could not be treated early unless it was decisively cut open. Therefore, it mobilized the people's defense reserve teams from Pan County, Pu'an, Qinglong, and other neighboring counties to launch a suppression campaign. Long Tengxiao then tore off his mask and led nearly a thousand men to resist, his...

### Desertion of New Recruits Should Be Pursued According to Procedures

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 14th] After enlisting, volunteer soldiers from the three counties of Xichengyi often desert. The pursuing troops do not follow procedures and often take away family members or guarantors to force them to hand over the deserters. There have even been cases of falsely claiming desertion and extorting money from family members and guarantors. The Yixing Self-Defense Force and the troops falsely claiming to be pursuers have had clashes. The county government telegraphed the regimental area command, strictly ordering a stop to these practices to prevent further incidents. After receiving the report, the Wuxi regimental area command stated that illegal pursuit of deserters violates the regulations of the Ministry of National Defense and easily causes public resentment. On the 13th, it telegraphed the three county governments, instructing them to investigate and stop such practices. In the future, if new recruits desert, they should report to the division headquarters, which will issue official documents in a unified manner and pursue them according to the procedures for apprehending deserters to avoid inciting incidents and maintain public opinion.

Zhenjiang

[Our Newspaper] The Provincial Security Command established the Second Jiangsu Provincial Training Corps to improve the quality of cadres, appointing Major General Wang Shaozhi as the corps commander. The corps headquarters is located in Wuxi, and barracks have been surveyed in Yixing and Liyang. The corps is expected to have 2,000 personnel, with a training period of one year.

Songjiang

[Our Newspaper] Citizens Lu Guiliang and Wu Cunfu, etc., of this county, have complained that the county land tax office has changed the conversion rate for converting grain tax into rough rice (adding two deciliters of rough rice for each stone of grain tax). The people find it difficult to bear this burden, especially since the tax for 1948 has already increased by eight deciliters per yuan compared to last year. Now, changing the conversion rate is equivalent to extorting the people's blood and sweat to be used as bonuses for subordinates, which does not benefit the country or the people. Furthermore, more than 10,000 stones of tax rice collected in 1946 and 1947 were owed by the district chiefs and warehouse managers of the office. The supervisors failed to supervise in advance and have not strictly pursued the matter afterwards. Now, changing the conversion rate not only increases the burden on the people but also violates existing laws and regulations. Therefore, they have telegraphed the Ministry of Food and the provincial government separately, requesting correction.
