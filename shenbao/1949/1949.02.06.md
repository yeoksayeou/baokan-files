### Government Begins Working in Guangzhou, Executive Yuan Council Meeting Held Tomorrow Afternoon, Presidents of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans to Inspect Guangzhou

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 5th] The Executive Yuan officially began working in Guangzhou on the 5th. In the morning, Premier Sun and Vice Premier Wu invited Legislative Yuan Vice President Liu Jianqun, members of the Legislative Yuan in Guangzhou, and the speakers of the provincial and municipal councils to inquire about the security and economic situation in Guangdong Province, and to consult on opinions regarding the current situation. In the afternoon, they invited heads of various ministries and commissions from the south to discuss matters and give instructions. Premier Sun also scheduled a reception for reporters on the 6th. According to sources, after arriving here yesterday, Premier Sun immediately convened a meeting with military and political leaders, including Yu Hanmou, Xue Yue, Zhang Fakui, and Liu Jiwen. The content was not disclosed.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th] The Executive Yuan is scheduled to attend the expanded memorial week assembly held at the Memorial Hall on the 7th, then visit the Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs at Huanghuagang, and hold an Executive Yuan Council meeting at 4:00 PM. Premier Sun and Vice Premier Wu are also scheduled to invite members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans staying in Guangzhou, as well as members of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Kuomintang, to a symposium at the Municipal Government Guest House at 10:00 AM on the 6th. Furthermore, the Central Standing Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting in Guangzhou on the morning of the 8th.

[Our Newspaper] Regarding the political rumors sparked by Premier Sun's trip to Guangzhou, according to Gan Jiehou, he was ordered to meet with Premier Sun on the 3rd of this month. Premier Sun said at the time, "I must go to Guangzhou once, firstly because I have already notified the diplomatic corps to move to Guangzhou. Several countries' embassies have moved south, and some ambassadors or ministers have already arrived in Guangzhou. It is polite to make a trip to Guangzhou. At the same time, there are several things in Guangzhou that must be handled in person. However, I will return to Nanjing within days." In fact, the Legislative Yuan has decided to hold a meeting in Nanjing. The Executive Yuan is constitutionally responsible to the Legislative Yuan, and the heads of ministries and commissions must submit policy reports and answer inquiries. It is impossible to establish two separate locations. In spirit, it is necessary to be in the same location to be responsible. Therefore, the Executive Yuan will definitely move back to Nanjing.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian and Supervisory Yuan President Yu Youren are scheduled to fly to Guangzhou from Nanjing by special plane at 10:00 AM on the 6th. The purpose of their trip is to understand the situation in Guangzhou after the Executive Yuan moved south and to urge Premier Sun to return to Nanjing. It is said that the two will also return to Nanjing within three to five days.

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 5th] According to Legislative Yuan Vice President Liu Jianqun, it is not yet known when President Tong will come to Guangzhou. The third session of the Legislative Yuan will be held in mid-February in accordance with the constitution. If the government moves south, the meeting place will be in Guangzhou. Liu ended with an optimistic tone, saying, "China always has a way."

### Legislative Yuan Prepares to Reconvene in Guangzhou, Supervisory Committee Members Remaining in Shanghai Dissatisfied with Executive Yuan's Move South

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Legislative Yuan Secretary-General Chen Kewen returned to Nanjing from Shanghai by train on the morning of the 5th. According to his interview with reporters, the date and location of the Legislative Yuan meeting are difficult to determine at present. However, most of the Legislative Yuan staff have left Nanjing, so it is unlikely that it will be convened in Nanjing. According to his statistics, the largest number of Legislative Committee members are in Shanghai, reaching over a hundred, followed by Guangzhou. There are also many in Guangxi, Taiwan, and Nanjing. When and where the meeting will be held in the future will depend on seeking the opinions of the majority of Legislative Committee members and the development of the situation. Chen recently went to Shanghai to distribute public funds to Legislative Committee members in Shanghai. He will go to Guangzhou and Guangxi within days, but the date is undecided.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th] After Legislative Yuan Vice President Liu Jianqun and Deputy Secretary-General Yan Guofu led staff to Guangzhou at the end of last month to prepare for the Legislative Yuan to convene in Guangzhou, they actively made preparations. After consultation, it was decided that the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall would be the meeting place, and the Wende Road Sun Yat-sen Library and the Guanyinshan Zhongyuangang Library would be the offices. Hotels were booked for the committee members' accommodation, and each committee member could be assigned a room. All resumption affairs are ready, and more than forty Legislative Committee members from various places have already reported for duty, and the rest are coming to Guangzhou one after another. According to the Deputy Secretary-General, the resumption will be held as soon as the Legislative Committee members meet the legal quorum.

[Central News Agency, this city] Supervisory Committee members remaining in Shanghai held a symposium at the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Supervisory Committee office at 9:00 AM on the 5th. Over fifty people attended, including Vice President Liu Zhe, and Supervisory Committee members Ju Zheng, Yang Hu, Liu Pingjiang, and Ni Bi. Wang Xiangchen was elected as the chairman. The theme of the discussion focused on promoting peace and the government's relocation. The majority of the Supervisory Committee members expressed dissatisfaction with the Executive Yuan's move to Guangzhou, and they all believed that the Supervisory Yuan should not move with the government in order to facilitate the early realization of peace. The Yuan meeting in February is still scheduled to be held in Nanjing on the 15th. The symposium decided to establish a Peace Issues Research Committee, and Liu Pingjiang, Tao Baichuan, Ni Bi, and others were appointed to preside over the discussion of concrete steps to promote peace. The meeting adjourned at noon.

[Our Newspaper] Over forty Supervisory Committee members remaining in Shanghai held a discussion yesterday and decided to formally impeach Premier Sun for ordering the heads of various ministries to move south, disrupting government affairs and unsettling people's minds.

### Fuzhou to Become an Economic Center, Deputy Finance Minister Yang Daoyue and Others Arrive One After Another, Advance Personnel of Various Embassies Arrive in Guangzhou One After Another

[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 5th] Current signs indicate that Fuzhou will become an economic center. Deputy Finance Minister Yang Daoyue, Director of the National Treasury Wang Fuzhou, and Director of the Salt Administration Li Tang have all arrived in Fuzhou by plane one after another. The head office of the Farmers Bank of China has found a location on Shangteng Road in the city to build a new office. In addition, a large number of public and private banks plan to move to Fujian. There are widespread rumors among the people that the Ministry of Finance will move to Southern Fujian for office work.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 5th] Recently, many people have been evacuating from the capital to Guangdong and Guangxi, and the traffic on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has exceeded its saturation point. Currently, the highways that can be accessed are one from the Hangzhou-Huizhou Road to Tunxi, passing through Jingdezhen to enter Jiangxi. The security on this line is poor. The other is from Chun'an via Jiangshan and Shangrao to Nanchang. Over a hundred military vehicles pass through this road every day. From Nanchang to Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong, the roads are clear.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 5th] Recently, embassies of various countries in Nanjing have been sending advance personnel to Guangzhou to find office locations. It has been found that those who have arrived here include U.S. Minister Clark; Counselor of the British Embassy, ​​Goldher; Counselor of the French Embassy, ​​Lohai; First Secretary of the Australian Embassy, ​​Li Guijiang; Counselor of the Italian Embassy, ​​Jibi Ge; Counselor of the Dutch Embassy, ​​Wei Maoxiang; First Secretary of the Indian Embassy, ​​Li Nan; Business Counselor of the Czech Embassy, ​​Shang Ni; Second Secretary of the Burmese Embassy, ​​Wu Bi; and Soviet Ambassador Rosen and his entourage. Before finding suitable embassy locations, most embassies are temporarily staying at the Aiqun Hotel. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has specially appointed Wang Jingxian, a protocol officer, to be responsible for reception.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 4th, United Press] The State Department announced today that thirteen members of the U.S. Embassy in China have moved from Nanjing to Guangzhou with the National Government. Ambassador Stuart and 39 members of his staff, along with six members of their families, remain in Nanjing. The personnel moving to Guangzhou are led by Minister Clark.

[United Press, Guangzhou, 5th] Key figures who have moved south are busy looking for houses. The provincial and municipal governments are doing their best to fulfill their landlord duties. The government that moved south does not show any signs of activity. Today, personnel from the embassies of nine more countries arrived here from Nanjing. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs office in Guangzhou formally entertained foreign guests for the first time last night. The U.S. Embassy office is located in a new house in Shamian, which is still being renovated, but U.S. Minister Clark and embassy staff have already started working today.

### Presidential Seal Still in Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Foreign news reported that the presidential seal has been transported to Guangzhou. Huang Xuecun, Director of the Second Bureau of the Presidential Palace, formally denied it on the 5th. According to Huang, the presidential seal is still in Nanjing.

### President Chiang Visits Yuwang Temple

[Our Newspaper, Ningbo, 5th] President Chiang returned to Xikou after retiring, and more than ten days have passed in the blink of an eye. He enjoys visiting scenic spots in Xikou and has also visited places such as Xiaowang Temple in Fengcheng, enjoying his leisure time. At around 9:00 AM this morning, he and Chiang Ching-kuo, Yu Jishi, and others took two small cars from Xikou directly to Ningbo and then to Yuwang Temple in Eastern Yin for sightseeing. Upon hearing of the President's arrival, the abbot immediately led all the monks to greet him in front of the temple. The President and his party rested briefly in the abbot's room and then toured the entire temple, looking very happy. At noon, they were treated to a vegetarian feast by the abbot. Chen Youhua, the Magistrate of Yin County, heard the news and took a car to Yuwang Temple to greet him at 2:00 PM. The police patrol team also rushed to patrol and guard the highway area. The President returned to Xikou by the original car at 5:00 PM.

### Ding Zhipan Discusses Peace Movement

Partial Peace Is No Different from Surrender

Beijing and Shanghai Cannot Be the Second Beiping

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 5th] Chairman Ding Zhipan expounded his views on peace at a press conference today. He first said with a smile, "Because I am a soldier, I naturally hope to fight on." However, this statement was immediately interpreted as a "joke." He believes that because the Communist Party's attitude is strong, the prospects for peace talks are not optimistic. After the meeting, Ding also frequently spoke to our newspaper reporters about the current situation, which is actually more difficult to achieve peace than to fight. He also said that he is prepared to have the belief of Zheng Chenggong and Shi Kefa. When the reporter inquired about the local peace movement in Beijing and Shanghai that is currently being brewing, Ding replied that local peace is no different from surrender, and Beiping can be taken as a lesson. Ding's view on local peace in Beijing and Shanghai is that because the people's hope for peace is more urgent, and local peace conforms to the Communist Party's conspiracy to divide the government's power, this statement is very likely to be accepted by the Communist Party. However, this is only limited to the Communist Party, with the people as the object of negotiation. From the military's standpoint, under the major premise of the government's sovereignty and national interests, it is impossible to sit idly by and watch Beijing and Shanghai become the second Beiping. Regarding the issue of river defense, Ding said that there are nearly a hundred warships constantly patrolling the river below Nanjing, and the garrison troops on the Nanjing-Shanghai line have more than ten armies, so there is no problem with river defense. However, this does not mean that the Communist army can never cross the river. Small units of less than a thousand people can "sneak across" at any time, so he has recently been actively carrying out mass organization and training work in the Jiangnan area, targeting this point.

### Nanjing People's Peace Delegation Flew to Beiping from Qingdao Today, List of 11 Members Announced

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 5th] The Beijing People's Peace Delegation spoke with the Beiping Joint Office on the morning of the 5th, and Zhou Beifeng relayed to Mr. Ye Jianying that there were slight revisions to the matters notified yesterday: (1) Take off for Beiping at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th; (2) Land at Xiyuan Airport; (3) Bring enough fuel for the return trip; (4) Only open radio communications when flying over Beiping; (5) Absolutely guarantee the safety of the aircraft and crew; (6) Call Beiping before taking off; (7) The Joint Office will send personnel to greet them at the airport. As for the accompanying reporters, Mr. Ye agreed to consider it. A decision may be made when they speak again at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 5th. In addition, Zeng Zisheng, the spokesperson for the delegation, solemnly stated: "The Qingdao telegram issued by the Central News Agency yesterday, which claimed that Wu Yuhou, a representative of the delegation, spoke with Ye Jianying through personal relations, is not in accordance with the facts, because the delegation never engages in activities in a personal capacity, and Mr. Ye did not directly answer the phone."

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 5th] The list of the Beijing Peace Delegation was sent to Beiping on the evening of the 4th. The delegation stated that the name of the delegation should be "People's Peace Delegation Jointly Organized by the China People's Peace Promotion Association and the China National University Professors National Policy Research Association." The list is as follows: Representative and Chief Representative Qiu Zhizhong, Representative and Secretary-General Wu Yuhou, Representative and Spokesperson Zeng Zisheng, Representatives Deng Weiyu, Song Guoshu, Xia Yuanzhi, Wu Zhesheng, Deputy Secretary-General Miao Diqing, Secretaries Liu Da Kui, Huang Gao, and Ren Zhujun, a total of eleven people.

### Candidates for Shanghai Delegation Determined, Mission is to Knock on the Door for Peace Talks, Trip North Postponed for One or Two Days on Orders, Huang Shaohong and Huang Xuchu Arrived in Nanjing to Meet Acting President Li to Discuss

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Government Peace Representatives Huang Shaohong, a member of the Legislative Yuan, and Huang Xuchu, Chairman of Guangxi, flew to Nanjing from Wuhan by plane on the afternoon of the 5th. Acting President Li invited the two, as well as Shao Lizi and others, to a banquet that night, during which they exchanged views on the issue of peace.

[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] People close to Acting President Li said tonight that the Communist Party has given a reply to Li's peace proposal. This move is at least the first step in starting formal negotiations. Details of the Communist Party's reply are not known, but it is believed here that Li has finally managed to obtain direct contact with the Communist Party without having to publicly exchange views through radio stations.

[United Press, Nanjing, 5th] People around Vice President Li openly expressed optimism about the future of peace on the 5th, but the reason for their optimism was hidden. On the surface, Li's mission to achieve peace between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is less obvious than it was a week ago when Premier Sun and others were in Shanghai, but Li's advisors are all showing trust, which shows that he at least hopes to persuade the Communist Party to start peace talks. The Beiping Communist Army's welcome of the Shanghai Peace Representatives is probably one of the reasons for their optimism. On the other hand, it is said that the Communist Army's failure to advance to the north bank of the Yangtze River has given Vice President Li's faction confidence that its efforts can succeed. The Communist Army's withdrawal and reorganization near the Yangtze River is obviously an order from the high command. If the Communist Party does not intend to seek peace, why would it order the army to stop attacking the Yangtze River basin?

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] Regarding the matter of Yan Huiqing and others going to Beiping to meet with the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party to convey the government's sincerity for peace, the government is currently conducting careful research on relevant issues. In order to make it more complete and detailed, the peace delegation, originally scheduled to fly from Shanghai to Beiping on the 6th, has decided to postpone its departure for one or two days on the orders of Acting President Li. Shao Lizi, who was originally scheduled to fly to Shanghai on the 6th to fly to Beiping with Yan and others, has also postponed his trip to Shanghai due to the postponement of the delegation's trip. In addition, Gan Jiehou, who was sent by Acting President Li to Shanghai to contact Yan Huiqing and others to promote peace, is scheduled to return to Nanjing for a trip on the 6th.

[Our Newspaper] The candidates for the Shanghai Peace Delegation have been formally determined yesterday to be Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, Jiang Yong, Ling Xianyang, Ou Yuanhuai, and Hou Debang, in addition to the three people Yan, Zhang, and Jiang who had already been decided, the other three were only agreed upon after Gan Jiehou came to Shanghai again to contact them this time. Ling Xianyang is the president of Shanghai University, Ou Yuanhuai is the president of Daxia University, and Hou Debang is the general manager of Yongli Company, representing the education and industry sectors respectively. In addition to the six members of the delegation, Shao Lizi and Gan Jiehou will participate in a personal capacity to assist with everything. Zhang Zhizhong was unable to go because the Soviet government had responded to the Xinjiang-Siberia trade agreement and needed to return to the Northwest for negotiations. The date of departure for the delegation must be determined after Gan Jiehou flies to Beijing again today to ask for instructions, but it is already known for sure that it will be very soon. It has been reported by Beiping that the Communist Party has prepared special rooms in the Beiping Hotel for the peace representatives and their secretaries to use, and that all transportation required for the special plane to land and for activities in Beiping has been arranged. The delegation plans to stay in Beiping for a week to exchange opinions extensively with the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party. All of the above points were formally announced by Gan Jiehou last night. Gan also stated: The main task of the delegation is to ask the Chinese Communist Party to quickly appoint representatives for peace talks and to determine the time and location for peace talks. As for who they will meet after arriving in Beiping, they will talk about it after they arrive, and in principle, the more the better, implying that they will see Ye Jianying first. He also emphasized that the delegation will be doing "door-knocking" work for future peace talks, and it is not a formal peace negotiation, let alone a negotiation on local peace, because today "the central government cannot discuss local peace, and local governments have no right to discuss local peace." Gan also announced that the transportation tool to Beiping was originally scheduled to be the Zhuiyun special plane, but now the Central and China Airlines have automatically expressed their willingness to send a plane to send the representatives to Beiping. Whether the Zhuiyun plane or the special plane of the two companies will be used will be studied and decided later.

[Central News Agency, this city] Liu Pingjiang, Tao Baichuan, Ni Bi, and two other members of the Supervisory Yuan Peace Research Committee, visited Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, and Jiang Yong, who are about to fly to Beiping, at their residences yesterday afternoon to express the hopes of the Supervisory Yuan colleagues for peace and to fully exchange views on specific ways to promote peace.

[United Press, Beiping, 5th] Shanghai contacted Ye Jianying, Chairman of the Beiping Military Control Commission, by radio telephone on the 4th. Ye has agreed to receive the Shanghai Peace Delegation, but stipulated three points: (1) The talks must be kept secret and not disclosed to the press without permission. (2) No journalists are allowed to accompany them. (3) They should come to Beiping as people's representatives and not represent the government.

### Chen Cheng Invited Cheng Siyuan to a Banquet Yesterday Afternoon, Raised Opinions on Political and Military Reform, No Problem in Principle with Releasing Zhang Xueliang

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 5th] Provincial Chairman Chen Cheng invited Cheng Siyuan to a banquet on the 5th, accompanied by Liu Keshu, He Zhonghan, and He Liankui. After the meal, the two had a long conversation. Cheng first explained the will of the central government in detail and solicited opinions on political, economic, and military reforms. Chairman Chen emphasized that whether for peace or war, the principle should be national unity, and it is still necessary to study. He will hand it over to the main secretary's office for handling after Cheng returns to Nanjing. As for urging Weng Wenhao and Sun Lianzhong to return to Nanjing, according to Cheng, Weng is currently in Tainan and is preparing to urge him by telephone. Sun will visit him within days. He does not plan to visit Zhang Xueliang during his stay in Taiwan.

### A China Airlines Plane Went Missing, It Has Landed in Yan'an with Passengers, The Company Plans to Submit Measures to Prevent Wrong Landings

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 5th] It is reported that the relevant authorities here have received a special telegram that a China Airlines plane that went missing, carrying 15 passengers, has safely arrived in Yan'an.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 5th] Liu Jingyi, General Manager of China Airlines, recently arrived in Taiwan from Hong Kong to inspect business and flew back to Shanghai on the 5th. According to people in charge of the company: Based on the judgment that the No. 135 passenger plane, which took off from Shanghai and made an intermediate landing in Jinan, had lost contact with the ground after takeoff, it is highly likely that it was "forced to land" in Jinan. The company has sent a telegram to Beiping, requesting the Jinan authorities to provide passengers with the convenience of leaving the country as much as possible, and to assist in repairing the plane if it is damaged and allow the plane to return. However, no response has been received so far. Since the plane made a wrong landing in Jinan, the company has now formulated three measures: (1) Find a way to prevent passengers from entering the pilot's room. (2) Request the government to allow pilots to carry pistols for self-defense. (3) Pilots must sign a series of guarantees. The above measures will be implemented once approved.

### General Badger's Flagship to Come to Shanghai Next Week, Adjustment of U.S. Navy in China, U.S. Marine Corps Activity Center Moves to Shanghai

[United Press, this city] Vice Admiral Badger, Commander of the U.S. Western Pacific Fleet, confirmed on the 5th that he would order his flagship "Eldorado" to come to Shanghai in the middle of next week, and the temporary headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet under his command would come at the same time. However, Badger stated that this does not mean that the headquarters of the Western Pacific Fleet will be established in Shanghai. Badger answered the question of whether more U.S. Marines would come to Shanghai, saying: There are already U.S. Marines in Shanghai. If more are needed, more Marines will be sent to Shanghai. Badger's statement was made on behalf of Admiral Ramsey, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, who is making a routine inspection trip in China. Ramsey told the U.S. press that due to changes in the situation in China and a reduction in the naval budget, the U.S. Navy in China and the Pacific region has to be readjusted and redeployed. Ramsey also stressed Badger's previous statements that U.S. policy toward China is determined by the State Department in Washington, and the Navy is only an institution that implements its policy. Ramsey also said that the reduction in naval funding not only affects the Navy's position in China, but also affects all naval facilities in the Pacific region. At the same time, the time is not yet ripe to publish any documents on the details of the impact of this matter. It is necessary to re-evaluate the situation and start from a new foundation. This is a difficult problem that will be faced. It seems too early to say a new plan. The recommendation or implementation of this policy will depend on the need.

Ramsey also said that naval funding has been cut, and work in all regions of the Pacific region must be limited, and China is in this region. The number of future naval facilities in each region in this region will be determined by the Navy's need to execute the State Department's orders. Currently, one of the main parts of the State Department's policy on the civil war in China is to protect American expatriates. Badger reiterated that U.S. naval policy is to have enough U.S. Marines in any place to meet the needs of the situation. The question of enough is determined by urgent needs. Badger pointed out that in the past, the Tianjin area was in dire need of U.S. Marines to protect American expatriates. Most American expatriates have now withdrawn from that area, and in the future, Shanghai will be the center of activity related to the duties of the Marine Corps.

According to him: Because Li had a good relationship with the Communist Army generals in Northern Jiangsu in the past, it is very possible (according to the reporter, many mid-level and above cadres in the Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu are former subordinates of Li).

### If the Government is Willing to Fully Innovate

— Xu Daolin

A Concrete Suggestion Regarding Administration

On the front lines, battles are lost, and soldiers die or are wounded by the tens of thousands, while the lives of high-ranking generals become ever more luxurious; common people are ruined, their families broken, and they are displaced, with hundreds dying daily of starvation and cold, while the wealth of powerful, corrupt officials grows daily. This is military and political affairs today.

Everywhere, in streets and alleys, are hung signboards of government offices, yet there is not a single person who earnestly manages the things that should be managed in society. At the central and local levels, there are tens of thousands of agencies, holding meetings and promulgating laws and regulations every day, formulating measures, yet the actual national economy and the people's livelihood remain as before, even deteriorating. Hundreds of thousands of civil servants, receiving meager salaries that are not enough to keep them warm or fed, walk in and out of government offices from morning till night, just turning somersaults through piles of official documents. This is administration today!

During the military suppression period, conscription of soldiers and collection of grain are, of course, the most important policies at the local level. Within a county, the monthly expenses of all agencies combined are not even equal to the difference in subsidies for food and fodder for one month, and the total annual budget is not equal to the resettlement fees for one conscript. What the government demands from the people is conscription, collection of grain, and apportionment; and what it gives them are refugees begging along the streets, roaming students stirring up trouble, veterans engaging in forced purchases and sales, and military dependents barging into homes, slamming tables, and breaking bowls. This is the life of the people in various localities today.

Why is the people's livelihood so difficult today? It is because of the successive military defeats over the past year. Why are military and political affairs so corrupt? It is because of the narrow-mindedness, hypocrisy, and selfishness of those in power. Why is administration so incompetent? It is because the current system makes personnel matters unreasonable.

Under such circumstances, continuing in this way will only lead to things getting worse and worse, and more and more bitter, whether it be war or peace, nothing can be discussed. What I want to discuss now is: if the war situation can improve, or if peace talks can truly achieve a ceasefire, if those in power can make a mental shift and truly consider the welfare of the broad masses of people when deciding on policies, and truly use people based on their talents, ambitions, merits, and demerits, without regard to their factions or systems, speaking truthfully and acting truthfully, then in administration, how should we seek improvement?

I believe that a thorough and effective administrative reform should achieve the following points:

(1) Merge and Reduce Institutions

The various administrative institutions at the central and local levels that need to be reformed can be roughly divided into three types: one is permanent institutions that nominally have formal responsibilities but actually have no power or ability (mostly at the central level), another is temporary institutions that actually have power but are overlapping and redundant in nature (mostly in cities), and the third is a group of decorative institutions that are idle and exist only in name (mostly in localities). I will now analyze them as follows:

Permanent institutions (using square seals) often become powerless and incompetent because their main business, which is to deal with personnel matters, is often extracted and formed into separate institutions (such as land administration, health, and police being separated from the Ministry of Interior), or simply formed into temporary institutions (such as the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration outside the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Commander-in-Chief cum Administrative Governor outside the Provincial Government, and the Materials Bureau outside the Ministry of Finance). And these temporary institutions (using long seals), because their leaders are mostly favored by the current dynasty, and the matters they manage are urgent matters of the moment, naturally do not take their competent authorities seriously, so in addition to overlapping, they cause delays, and in addition to redundancy, they add to numbness. And the organization of these institutions themselves, because they are favored by the heavens, naturally have abundant personnel and generous funding, forming a huge, empty, extravagant, and wasteful special class in government agencies! As for some decorative institutions that exist only in name, most of them are established by important party and state figures to arrange personnel for factional gains. To place their subordinates, they universally set up descendant sinecures (divisions, bureaus, offices, sections) at all levels of localities. However, in reality, they cannot raise funds to carry out their business, nor can they find personnel who are trained and interested in these businesses, and there is no urgent need in the environment to handle these businesses. Naturally, these institutions have no choice but to be idle, neither alive nor dead, and spend their calm lives in a dim and boring way.

Because countless redundant institutions have been added year after year, and those many decorative institutions that exist only in name are unable to be filled, the competent authorities are unable to quickly and effectively solve problems, the processing time for official documents becomes increasingly long and cannot be shortened, the number of civil servants becomes increasingly large, and it becomes increasingly difficult to improve their treatment. As a result, administrative agencies generally become incompetent and wasteful!

To merge and reduce institutions, regarding the above-mentioned overlapping and redundant institutions, we should hire a number of fair-minded people who are knowledgeable in theory and well-versed in political affairs to form a committee—paying special attention to their neutral and objective standpoint—to conduct a thorough investigation of the work situation (business, funding, organization, purpose, efficiency) of these institutions themselves. Then, based on the obtained data and the relationship between them and the relevant permanent institutions, conduct detailed research and decide on their organizational adjustment. I believe that after this kind of reorganization, most of the current overlapping and redundant institutions can be abolished or merged, and most of the permanent institutions will become powerful and capable.

Regarding the abolition of all ineffective and nominal decorative institutions in localities, we should instruct the senior local authorities to designate fair and capable cadres to thoroughly investigate their work situation and carefully study their adjustment methods. Any institution that does not have sufficient funds to carry out its business, or does not have capable personnel to carry out its business, or does not have a suitable environment to carry out its business, should be abolished without exception. Do not be swayed by the beautiful names on their signboards and have any scruples or pity. If you keep a group of idle people alive and force them to become useless, it is not only unfair to other personnel, but also too inhumane to them.

(2) Reduce Personnel

Except for a few agencies where there are too few personnel and they are completely unable to do anything, it can be said that there is not a single administrative agency in the country that is not overstaffed, spending their time drinking tea, smoking, reading newspapers, talking and laughing, and dozing off. However, this is still the lesser of the harms. The unevenness of work and leisure leads to disharmony among colleagues, everyone has to find a way to put a stamp on official documents, making documents extra slow, and the work is too easy, creating a general atmosphere of laxity and lack of morale. This is the greater of the harms.

The method of reducing personnel should take the following steps: (1) Collect all the incoming and outgoing documents of an agency within a week and conduct a sampling inspection. (2) Based on the number and nature of the incoming and outgoing documents, calculate the number of people that the agency must have. —My standard: For staff members, they should be assigned at least three to five ordinary official documents per day; for clerks, they should copy at least 2,500 to 3,000 words per day—When calculating, allocate the responsibility for handling official documents to staff members based on the number of documents, allocate the responsibility for copying to clerks based on the number of words, and allocate the responsibility for administrative matters to administrative staff based on the number of staff members and clerks. (3) Finally, adjust the organization based on the number of necessary office personnel. —My standard: Five to ten staff members form a unit, three to five units form a section, and five to seven sections form a department or bureau. And among the current personnel, who should stay and who should go, all should be determined by open and fair methods such as examinations, performance reviews, and tests. After such an adjustment is made to each agency—determining the number of personnel based on the business, and determining the organization based on the number of personnel—I believe that at least two-thirds of the personnel can be reduced, and in many cases, I believe it can reach four-fifths.

We should allow all the personnel who are reduced in this way to continue to receive their original treatment (too many unemployed civil servants will cause serious social problems), but to find suitable outlets for them, we should organize various training classes and lectures in conjunction with the current needs of various villages in localities (we must solemnly find first-class talents to preside over them). Then, assign them a new and active job. My estimate is that the best outlets for these eliminated civil servants are adult literacy education, village education, guidance on rural sideline occupations, promotion of rural cooperation, and security officers, etc. With China's vast rural society, accommodating these people is not a problem. And as long as we can make these urban people return to the countryside to live, I guarantee that the national political economy will improve.

(3) Improve Treatment

Only after merging institutions and reducing personnel can we talk about improving treatment, and it can also be said that the latter is the purpose of the former two. If we do not improve the treatment of civil servants to a level that barely maintains their livelihood, and want to curb corruption and improve efficiency, it is like using a group of corrupt and incompetent civil servants and hoping for a clear government and a happy people, like climbing a tree to catch fish. If an agency, after merging and reducing, has only one-third or one-fifth of its original personnel left, I advocate that this group of elite cadres, in the midst of economic turmoil, should all be paid in hard currency (for example, from ten to two hundred yuan). Those who raise treatment locally can refer to the system of paying with grain (for example, from one dan to twenty dan). If we transfer the people's current burden for military affairs—conscript fees, differential fees, various temporary apportionments—to this improved treatment, it will be absolutely more than enough. At that time, we can take an absolutely unceremonious attitude and mentality towards this group of civil servants who receive improved treatment, and demand that they not be corrupt and not be incompetent. We can change incompetent ones at any time without worrying about no one answering, and we can severely punish corrupt ones, and those who receive it will die without resentment.

(4) Innovate Several Systems

Many new systems cannot achieve their original good purposes, but instead have many opposite and bad effects. We must now recognize the facts, muster our courage, and carry out innovation in a sweeping way.

(1) The Administrative Three-System Integration

Now, all agencies in the country are implementing the three-system integration, but in reality, what is consumed in terms of material resources is the amount of paper used for compiling and printing various plans and reports, printing and postage, and what is consumed in terms of human resources is the personnel designated by various agencies to specifically deal with the so-called design and assessment. And in terms of effectiveness, it is a 100% official-style participation! (Reviewing last year's work plan this year is also considered design; a small official stays in a big yamen, the minister invites him to a few meals, sends a little gift, and writes a report that is neither painful nor itchy, which is called assessment.) I advocate abolishing this system happily to save a lot of manpower and material resources and correct the atmosphere of high-pitched hypocrisy.

(2) The Qualification and Appointment System

In our personnel system over the past ten years, the selection aspect can be said to have achieved some success. People who have passed the high and ordinary examinations have a considerable level. The qualification and appointment aspect can be said to be a complete failure. Because this system has not produced any selection and division effects, it has forced out many fake works, fake diplomas, and fake certificates, and all large and small agencies at home and abroad are supporting tens of thousands of personnel who specialize in dealing with these fake diplomas and fake certificates. On the contrary, people with ability and integrity are unable to catch up with those who pretend to be impostors because they are unwilling to fake and deceive, or are even forced to leave their jobs because their qualifications do not meet the requirements, which is even more harmful. Originally, with the underdevelopment of education in China and the lack of widespread examinations, it is necessary to raise the employment qualifications of civil servants, and at a time when authority and responsibility should be concentrated in the hands of chief officials at all levels, it is necessary to restrict their power of appointment. For ten years, with foreign aggression and domestic troubles, wars and famines, displacement and migration, it is necessary to rigidly bind such and such documentary evidence. How can this system work? I believe that the current qualification and appointment system should be resolutely stopped. Each agency should have restrictions on the number of personnel and grades, but not on qualifications. The power of appointment belongs to the chief official, and the amount of treatment depends entirely on ability.

(3) The Accounting and Political System

In theory, it seems to be based on three premises: (1) All political, business, and administrative affairs of an agency can fully trust the chief official, but they cannot absolutely trust the chief official's use of money. (2) The integrity of the chief official must not be credible, but the integrity of the accounting personnel must be credible. (3) Ordinary people are subject to the instructions and manipulation of the chief official, while accounting personnel are "transcendent" and cannot be affected by anything. Whether these three premises are accurate can be answered by anyone who is slightly involved in political affairs. And in today's economic chaos, price instability, and currency depreciation, this accounting and political system, precisely because it is a necessary procedure for reimbursement, creates the best guarantee for corruption and fraud. The fact that the current accounting and political system cannot save money for the country and the people is a minor matter; the fact that it restricts and restrains those who really want to do things and prevents them from exerting their abilities is a major matter. The fact that tens of thousands of accounting personnel are supported for nothing is a minor matter; the fact that the flow of corruption and fraud, with complete documents and perfect procedures, can avoid legal sanctions and social criticism is a major matter. I advocate abolishing all accounting and political systems, abolishing all fixed accounting and auditing personnel (a few agencies that use a particularly large number of threads, of course, must think of other ways), and establishing several specialized auditing agencies at the central and local levels—must carefully select a few upright and incorruptible people—to conduct surprise spot checks at any time, check thoroughly and realistically, and handle strictly and harshly, so that those who do things can let go of their hands, and those who cheat cannot but be wary. I think maybe it is a better way (anyway, it will not be worse than the current situation).

(4) People's Opinion Institutions

According to the current national conditions, it is difficult to have a sound administrative agency, and it is also not easy to have a sound people's opinion institution. And according to the current situation of the administrative agency, the existence of a people's opinion institution is ultimately better than not having a people's opinion institution. However, it is not a good policy at present for administrative agencies to be excessively constrained by people's opinion institutions in their facilities. I advocate giving administrative agencies more freedom to establish facilities, and allowing people's opinion institutions to exert their supervisory and impeachment functions more.

This Month's Household Rice Price Determined Advance Allocation of Ten Catties to End Mid-Month Mayor Guarantees Remaining Five Catties Will Be Redeemed After Mid-Month 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕The price of household rice for this month in our city has been determined by the Economic Coordination Committee, with two types of prices: Whole rice is priced at 4,800 yuan per dan, and the priority allocation rice is priced at 4,020 yuan per dan. Broken rice mixed with whole rice is priced at 3,360 yuan per dan, and the priority allocation rice is priced at 2,820 yuan per dan. It will begin today (6th) and end on the 15th. Mayor Wu stated at a press conference at the City Hall yesterday at 5 p.m. that the household rice allocation for this month is designed with three coupons. Due to the slow loading and unloading of warehouses, it has been decided to first allocate and sell ten catties. The first and second coupons of the rice allocation certificate will be used first, and it is stipulated that the first coupon can purchase five catties of whole rice, priced at 160 yuan per person for five catties, and 134 yuan per person for priority allocation of five catties. The second coupon can purchase two catties of whole rice and three catties of broken rice, priced at 112 yuan per person for five catties, and 94 yuan per person for priority allocation of five catties. Citizens who do not wish to purchase broken rice may voluntarily give it up, and the first coupon can be used alone. According to Mayor Wu, the reason why the date for purchasing household rice this time is set to end on the 15th is that the City Government hopes that citizens will rush to buy it all within ten days, which will reduce the demand for rice in the market and stabilize rice prices. Wu also emphasized that the city's rice supply is more than ever before, and the current reserves are sufficient to supply the city for three months. The reason why only ten catties of rice are allocated this time is entirely due to transportation difficulties, and he hopes that citizens will not be suspicious. He guarantees that the other five catties of rice will be redeemed immediately after the 15th. Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Council Resident Committee Holds Meeting in Shanghai Decides to Elect Pang Shusen as Acting Speaker 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕The Jiangsu Provincial Provisional Council held its 14th Resident Committee meeting at 2 p.m. yesterday in the conference room of the Provincial Bank in this city.

First, the Secretary-General of the Council, Xu Yuanruo, reported on seven items of Council affairs, and Director Chen of the Health Department reported on emergency response work. Then, the discussion began, and the following important cases were resolved: (1) Appointing Pang Diancai, Ling Shaozu, and Huang Sen to represent the Council at the peace conference convened by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Hubei People's Peace Promotion Association. (2) The 5th General Assembly of the Council was originally scheduled to be held on February 12th, but since Yangtai was abandoned, the focus of the provincial capital is shifting to Suzhou, and the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Council have not been legally elected. It was decided to postpone it to March 1st and hold it at the Council's location. (3) Since the Executive Yuan announced the approval of the resignations of Council Speaker Leng and Deputy Speaker Zhang, all Council affairs have been declared no longer responsible. Before the Speaker and Deputy Speaker are elected according to regulations, it was decided to elect Pang Shusen as Acting Speaker.

Various Municipal Organizations Jointly Telegraph the Speaker Expressing Opinions on Promoting Peace The Shanghai Municipal Council initiated the convening of the National Peace Promotion Conference, which will be held soon. The city's various national trade unions, educational associations, agricultural associations, women's associations, etc., to provide opinions for adoption, jointly telegraphed Council Speaker Shen and Deputy Speaker Xu yesterday. The original telegram is as follows: "Greetings omitted" Since your Council issued a telegram calling for the convening of the National Peace Promotion Conference on the 10th of this month, the provincial and municipal councils and civil organizations have risen up and responded unanimously, which shows that peace is the unanimous demand of the people across the country. Regardless of north or south, old or young, everyone detests the scourge of war and prays for the early realization of peace. However, it has recently been found that some people are advocating their so-called "partial peace," placing the entire country in disintegration, and trapping peace in inequality, in order to achieve their destruction of the realization of true and comprehensive peace, which is truly heartbreaking. This is what our people across the country resolutely oppose and cannot help but say. It is hoped that your Council and the representatives of the civil opinion organs and civil organizations participating in the Peace Promotion Conference in the provinces and cities will speak out loudly and unanimously advocate that peace must be comprehensive and negotiations must first cease fire. This is the blessing of peace and the fortune of the Chinese nation. Furthermore, the government's sincerity in seeking peace, compromising and seeking perfection, and repeatedly making concessions are all facts, which are seen by people at home and abroad. How has the CCP not ceased fire for more than a month, nor has it appointed representatives, determined the location and date, and even more so, has wantonly insulted and scolded in repeated broadcasts, which only hurts feelings and causes the door to peace to be opened, but negotiations have not yet been conducted, which is deeply regrettable. The National Peace Promotion Conference initiated by your Council is to represent the will of the entire people and to promote the realization of peace as its responsibility. It is hoped that concrete measures will be discussed quickly, calling on the CCP to immediately determine representatives, select a place for negotiations, and immediately cease fire, in order to save the people from water and fire and protect the national pulse from panting. As the nation's elites and opinion leaders are about to gather in Shanghai in the coming days to discuss peace, our association, etc., is speaking out for the people and presenting medicines for adoption, and we hope that you will take note." Small Industrial Loans in This City Can Still Be Applied For According to the City Industry Association, small industrial loans in this city can still be applied for after the Spring Festival. It is hoped that the various industrial trade associations will send the application forms and review opinions to the Central Bank's Discount Committee on the morning of the 7th. Those who have not received the application forms can contact the Technical Committee of the Industry Association at 115 Jiangxi Road to obtain them. It is also learned that emergency industrial loans have also been approved by the 24th meeting of the Discount Committee and can continue to be approved according to the previously determined review standards. However, those who have already received loans may not reapply. Provincial, Municipal, and County Native Place Associations Meet Yesterday to Discuss Appealing for Peace Representatives Will Be Sent to Contact the Communist Side National Provincial and Municipal Associations of Natives of Shanghai held their second joint meeting at the Shaoxing Native Place Association on Liuhe Road yesterday afternoon to discuss the issue of appealing for peace.

(3) The fourth General Assembly will be held at the Shaoxing Native Place Association at 2 p.m. on the 12th of this month.

Jiang Ya Aftermath Committee Warehouse Victims' Ornaments Stolen Clean 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕The Jiang Ya Wheel Tragedy Aftermath Committee warehouse downstairs of the Ningbo Native Place Association at 480 Xizang Road, stored eighteen travel bags, containing approximately 30,000 gold yuan, sixty-eight gold rings of various styles, two gold leaf pieces, three gold chains, six gemstone rings, two small diamond rings, four gold bracelets, one anklet, fifteen fountain pens, thirty-one watches, twenty-seven gold earrings, seven pocket watches, three silver dollars, and one platinum ring, all of which were objects of the victims salvaged from the sinking of the Jiang Ya. Yesterday morning at approximately 8 a.m., tea attendant Yang Quanhong suddenly discovered that the two large locks on the warehouse had been cut. After further discovery by economic coolie Wang Zuben, the batch of travel bags was moved to a small room behind the escalator. Some remaining pocket watches and fountain pens were left in the bags, but the rest were stolen. The incident was immediately reported to Chuan Longshan, the leader of the safekeeping team, who in turn reported it to the Lao Zha Police Sub-Bureau. Patrolman Tang Zhiliang and Sergeant Liu Zongtong were dispatched to investigate and took several tea attendants to the bureau for questioning to determine if there was any suspicion of internal theft. The investigation is currently underway. Zhong Weiquan, Already Sentenced to Death, Pays 2 Million Gold Yuan Bail 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕Zhong Weiquan, chairman of the Hangzhou Rice Industry Association, was previously accused of raising rice prices and hoarding for speculation, and was sentenced to death by the Hangzhou Special Criminal Court. Recently, due to the closure of the Special Criminal Court, the Hangzhou Special Criminal Court transferred Zhong to the Shanghai Special Criminal Court for temporary detention. The Shanghai Special Criminal Court transferred Zhong to the District Procuratorate for investigation yesterday. After the prosecutor investigated, he ordered Zhong to pay a cash bail of 2 million gold yuan, and he was released on bail at approximately 5 p.m. yesterday. Profiteers Raise Prices and Manipulate Western Medicine Prices Rise Abnormally The soaring and chaotic market prices of Western medicines have been rare in the past. Citizens who unfortunately fall ill are greatly troubled. It is reported that the city's reserves of Western medicines are very abundant, and since the fall of North China's Beiping and Tianjin, the sales routes of the northern gangs have also been cut off. Southern China's Guangdong and Guangxi provinces all purchase locally from Hong Kong and the Philippines. The actual sales of Western medicines in this city have been cut off. The current crazy rise is entirely due to the manipulation and price increases by large speculative households. The relevant authorities should quickly seek effective measures to stop it. Nineteen Land Certificates Completed Owners Allowed to Retrieve Them 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕Shen Zhenjia, Acting Director of the Land Administration Bureau, stated yesterday that nine-tenths of the land registration certificates in this city have been completed in the past, and the remaining one-tenth, approximately 10,000 pieces, are being actively cleared. Recently, due to the turbulent situation, citizens have been concerned about storing land registration documents in the bureau, so it has been decided to allow the owners to apply for retrieval, but a photo of the document must be retained. Also, there have been no personnel changes in the bureau. Only Wu Zunyang, Director of the Third Division, has been transferred to the position of Chief Secretary, and Xie Juntao, Secretary, has been transferred to the position of Director of the Third Division. Non-Motorized Vehicle License Plate Fees Revised 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕The Public Utilities Bureau has heard that the various vehicle registration offices under the Public Utilities Bureau have revised the fee for replacing license plates for non-motorized vehicles for the 37th year. The bureau believes that the price fluctuations are too drastic, and the cost of making new plates is very high. Iron-wheeled freight cars and pedicabs that have already been retrofitted can be exempted from production and issuance, and the replacement of bicycle license plates can be re-registered by the various registration offices with newly compiled numbers. Other non-motorized vehicle license plate replacements will uniformly collect 140 gold yuan per plate and must be paid to the original registration office by the 20th of this month, and the replacement license plate will be collected at the end of the month. Fire in Jiangwan Barracks 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕A fire broke out in the western barracks on Jiangwan Changzhong Road yesterday evening. The flames soared into the sky. Although the soldiers bravely rescued, the effect was minimal. Later, the Jiangwan Hongzhen and other fire brigades and the Central Fire Department rushed to the scene with pump trucks to put out the fire. The fire was extinguished at approximately 8:30 p.m. The result was the destruction of five rows of barracks. Rampant Scalpers at the Wharf Two or Three Hundred People Destroy Company 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕At approximately 4 p.m. on the 3rd, Li Qin, a policeman from the 3871st patrol of the Penglai Police Sub-Bureau, was on leave and wearing plain clothes, with a service pistol (number 238774) in his waist. He visited a friend at the Xundao Street Police Station and left. When passing the Huayi Street intersection of the New Wharf, he saw thirty or forty people holding thin knives, iron bars, shoulder poles, and other weapons, running wildly. Believing that a brawl was about to occur, he followed behind to investigate. He was stopped by these people, which led to a conflict. Li's service pistol was snatched by the crowd. In the chaos, he lost his gold ring and fountain pen. Seeing that they had succeeded, these people fled to the 16th Pier Wharf. Li immediately rushed back to the sub-bureau to report. After investigation by the Criminal Section Chief Kui Damai, it was learned that this group of gangsters were scalpers (specializing in receiving stolen goods) on the 45th Pier of the 16th Pier. Because they had accumulated hatred with the workers of Shengji Company, they gathered two or three hundred people at the 16th Pier and destroyed the Shengji Company and the office of the warehouse. They also slashed and injured the company's personnel. The Yimiao Sub-Bureau learned of this and immediately sent a large number of police officers to arrest them, causing them to flee in disarray. Afterwards, accomplices Lu Jinbao and Wang Amao were arrested and taken to the bureau for investigation. The service pistol that was snatched was found in the house of Lu Jintang (i.e., Mu Amao), the owner of the Shengji Company, and was reported to the Yimiao Sub-Bureau, which sent it to the Penglai Sub-Bureau for review. Director of Education Bureau Holds Symposium Amount of Fees Determined for Public and Private Schools Principals Suggest Calculation Based on 6,000 Yuan Per Shi of Rice Submitted to the Mayor for Review and Approval for Public Announcement 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕Li, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, held a symposium on tuition fees at Yucai Middle School at 3:30 p.m. yesterday. More than 100 people attended, including Municipal Council staff members Jiang Huaisu, Zhang Zhongyuan, Qu Yue, and representatives of principals, teachers, and staff of public and private primary and secondary schools. There was enthusiastic discussion at the meeting. A U.S. Senator suggested that the tuition fee standard be calculated based on the cost of living index, but this was opposed by the principals, who believed that the index was not practical. Senator Zhang suggested that tuition fees be paid in three installments, one installment every two months. Finally, it was decided that private schools would still use rice as the standard for fees, and convert the tuition fees of the previous semester into rice. Primary schools would charge 7.5 dou to 1.5 shi, junior high schools would charge 1.25 shi to 2.5 shi, and senior high schools would charge 1.75 shi to 3 shi. Whether to charge in installments would be determined by each school. The principals suggested that the rice price be converted at 6,000 yuan per shi. Director Li would ask Mayor Wu to decide. If Mayor Wu believes that 6,000 yuan is too high and wants to convert it at the current limited sales price of 4,800 yuan per shi, the principals requested that all the fees collected be sent to the mayor to allocate rice to the private schools at the price of 4,800 yuan. The fee standards for municipal schools have also been drafted, with senior high schools charging 1.6 shi, junior high schools charging 1.4 shi, and primary schools charging 9 dou to 1 shi, including teacher training funds. Because schools will need to open in the coming days, the above fee standards for public and private schools will be submitted to Mayor Wu for review and will be announced tomorrow. Law and Political Science Students Request Charging According to the Index 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕Shanghai College of Law and Political Science, located at Zhongzheng South Second Road, has set the tuition fee for this semester at five shi of white rice. Most of the students at the school feel that the situation is difficult and the price of rice is soaring, making it impossible to afford it. They decided yesterday to unanimously request the school to charge according to the general tuition fee method for private universities, paying in installments according to the cost of living index. A general assembly will be convened at 2 p.m. tomorrow, and representatives will be sent to negotiate with the school. Jiaotong University Scheduled to Start Classes on the 7th An Emergency Response Committee Has Been Established 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕Jiaotong University is scheduled to start classes on the 7th. The university's Emergency Response Committee has been formally established. The first committee meeting was held recently and passed the organizational charter. It was decided that the school authorities, the professors' association, the lecturers' and assistants' association, the staff's Lijing Society, the school workers' union, the students' union, and all the technicians would each nominate three representatives to form the committee. Under the committee are finance, materials, security, liaison, investigation, water and electricity groups. The fundraising target for emergency response funds is 800 dan of rice. However, the charity performance held at the school during the Lunar New Year did not yield good results due to low ticket prices and soaring prices. Furthermore, the university is scheduled to register from the 7th to the 12th and start classes on the 16th. National University Professors' Friendship Association Met Yesterday to Discuss Improving Treatment Sent Telegrams Calling for Action and Requested the Issuance of Emergency Response Funds 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕The professors' associations of Jiaotong and Fudan Universities invited professor representatives from Jinan, Tongji, Shanghai Commercial College, Shanghai Medical College, Kindergarten Teachers College, and Tangshan Institute of Technology to hold the first meeting of the National University Professors' Friendship Association at Jiaotong University's Ronghong Hall at 3 p.m. yesterday. The meeting discussed the issue of improving professors' treatment and decided to send telegrams to Acting President Li, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Education, explaining that the current monthly income of professors is only equivalent to one and a half silver dollars, and prices are still rising. They requested a quick improvement. In addition, they also requested the issuance of emergency response funds and grain storage funds for three months, all based on the price index at the time of payment. It was decided that Tongji and Fudan Universities would draft the above telegrams and send them out within days. In addition, it was agreed that each school would nominate a representative to contact the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance within days to urge the early allocation of funds. The second meeting of the association is scheduled to be held at Jinan University at 2 p.m. next Thursday, and will be held every week thereafter. The name of the association was originally intended to be the National University Professors' Association Federation, but because some schools still do not have professors' associations, it is now called the National University Professors' Friendship Association. Harvard Shanghai Alumni Association Scheduled to Hold Annual Banquet The Harvard alumni in this city recently re-elected the officers for 1949. Those elected are Cabot as President, Xu Weiming as Vice President, Baodemin as Secretary, and Qian Naixin as Treasurer. The association is scheduled to hold an annual banquet at the auditorium of the Bank of China on the 12th at 6 p.m. In addition to the handover ceremony for the new and old officers, Mr. Lai Puhan, Director of the China Division of the Economic Cooperation Administration and a current trustee of Harvard University, will attend and deliver a speech. Members of the association can contact Nie Guangdi of the China Insurance Bureau to reserve seats. If the Government Is Willing to Comprehensively Reform Continued from Page 2 (5) Judicial System Since the Anti-Japanese War, the most heartbreaking thing has been the decline in the reputation of the judiciary. This is the biggest hidden worry for the country's future, but unfortunately, it is not being taken seriously. The criticism of the judiciary is nothing more than two points: the backlog of cases, which often take years to resolve, makes people afraid to get involved, firstly. Arbitrary judgments, without responsibility, anyway, every case must go through appeal, causing people to lose faith, secondly. To save the situation, I intend that funds be raised by various localities, combined into hard currency or rice, to form a judicial fund. The presidents of courts at all levels should be responsible for gathering judges, or additionally hiring experienced lawyers, to form a temporary committee, responsible for clearing the backlog of cases. At the same time, it should be stipulated that judges who handle new cases and complete them within a certain period should receive certain bonuses. The above two types of expenses will be paid by this judicial fund. Furthermore, the judicial system should stipulate that judges should be responsible for questioning cases and making judgments. Any judge who has several cases overturned on appeal should be dismissed from his position, and his judicial officer and lawyer qualifications should be revoked at the same time. On the one hand, the appeal fees should be increased to prevent the general public from using them to delay time. The use of the jury system is even more worthy of our research and promotion. (5) Stop Promulgating Laws and Regulations and Use Orders I believe that if the government is determined to reform, it should decide not to promulgate any laws or regulations within a year. In the past twenty years, half in peacetime and half in wartime, all the laws and regulations that have been promulgated can be said to be all-encompassing and all-inclusive. But where is the effect that has actually occurred? If the laws and regulations are all effective, looking at a set of domestic affairs laws and regulations, what kind of rule of law country should China be? We are not lacking laws and regulations now, but there are too many laws and regulations; it is not that our laws are not good, but that our laws are not effective. The reason why they are not effective is because they are made behind closed doors and are not practical; it is because the upper-level agencies at all levels, on the one hand, pay too much attention to control, and want to use laws and regulations to bind the lower levels everywhere, and on the other hand, they are afraid of taking responsibility, and want to use laws and regulations to replace orders everywhere, that is, they are willing to admit the imperfection of a certain law or regulation they have formulated, but they are unwilling to admit the inappropriateness of a certain thing they have handled. Therefore, I advocate that all agencies should not promulgate any generally applicable laws and regulations in the future, but should retain all the laws and regulations of the past for reference when implementing policies. At the same time, all agencies with responsibility and authority should be held responsible for handling matters in full authority. They are not allowed to ask the higher-level agencies for instructions unless it is absolutely impossible to decide. The higher-level agencies are only allowed to issue instructions through orders based on the time, the matter, and the reason. They must not use the excuse of laws and regulations or precedents as the basis for their approval or disapproval. (At least we should give each administrative agency the power to appropriately change the existing laws and regulations when there is a legitimate reason.) In this way, if anything happens, no one will be left to handle it, and the person in charge cannot shirk the responsibility for the quality of the handling. Any matter, the handling agency, and the higher-level agency can and must handle it appropriately according to the time, the situation, and the reason, and will not and dare not use the four words "it concerns a general case" to block and cope with everything. (6) Steps of Reform When it comes to administrative reform, we must clearly understand that the key to everything lies in the people who actually implement it, that is, everything lies in the administrative leaders in various places. I not only advocate that each province should have its own reform methods, and each county should have its own reform methods, but also advocate that everyone may have their own reform methods. How China's entire destiny will be in the future depends entirely on the situation in each province, and how the situation in each province depends entirely on the situation in each county, and how the county government is everything depends on the county magistrate. If we want to improve the county government, we must be able to get people of great importance to be county magistrates. I believe that being able to have a few more people who have served as ministers and vice-ministers with excellent performance to serve as county magistrates will bring immeasurable benefits to the country. We want them to go, not because we want them to be county magistrates for the sake of being county magistrates, but because we want them to be able to bring several important cadres with them to research and experiment, improve, and create. I believe that a county magistrate of the ministerial level, with four or five cadres of the division chief level and seven or eight cadres of the section chief level, can certainly put everything in this county - household administration, police administration, financial administration, grain administration - in order in a important county in six months to eight months, and arrange everything in a workable scale in terms of systems - organization, personnel, and expenses. At this time, we will disperse the capable cadres here - the original old cadres, plus the newly absorbed and trained cadres - to several neighboring counties, and use the experience gained and the skilled hands to promote effective methods. In this way, spreading gradually from small to large and from near to far, I believe that a province will be able to achieve a small success in less than three years. Then, using the cadres of this province to promote in neighboring provinces, within five years, the whole country will be transformed. By that time, the central government, which is high above, will not be able to govern, even if it wants to. The above discussion is limited to general administrative reform. As for the many problems in the military and economic aspects, I will leave them to those who have more research than me to discuss. I will not speak presumptuously. Yesterday Evening's Basketball League Hualian Wins After Hard Fight Defeats Mailing By Two Points Result 61 to 59 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕In yesterday evening's exciting basketball league game, Hualian defeated Mailing by two points, 61 to 59. In the first half, Hualian also went through a hard battle to catch up with Mailing, which can be said to be a very dangerous win. Hualian's performance was lackluster, perhaps due to the cold weather. Mailing had tall players, and Hualian's use of low passes did not yield good results. Da Li did not play, and Wu Chengzhang was injured, both of which affected their strength. In the first half, Mailing took the lead with 10 to 5 and 15 to 5, Hualian was behind by as much as ten points, and only caught up by one point in the first half, 33 to 32. In the second half, Adi came on with an injury, and Le Jiazhou and Shuzhong led the team to a 48 tie, and then each reached 50, 57, and the situation was difficult to separate. Liang Xiong scored two consecutive goals, and Hualian finally won with 61 to 59. More than 2,000 spectators in the gymnasium expressed their satisfaction.

A Certain Lady Enthusiastically Helps Education Generously Donates More Than Three Taels of Gold Jewelry Since "Anonymous" generously donated 100,000 yuan the day before yesterday, our newspaper-sponsored "Reader Scholarship Fund" received another donation yesterday from a female reader in person, who generously donated three pieces of gold jewelry in the name of "A Certain Lady," weighing more than three taels and two fen, setting a new donation record. It is said: "I have always sympathized with poor students, and I greatly admire Shen Bao's long-standing advocacy of scholarship movements and its efforts to help poor and out-of-school students. Therefore, I am donating three pieces of gold jewelry that I have collected to the scholarship fund, hoping to do my best for the students. I also hope that female comrades from all walks of life will respond enthusiastically." Before leaving, she repeatedly entrusted us to not seek false fame for doing good deeds and asked us not to publish her real name. While accepting the donation, our newspaper is deeply grateful and sincerely hopes that enthusiastic men and women from all walks of life will continue to make donations, which will be of great benefit to the future of education. In addition, Shi Wenchao, a reader of our newspaper, gave his second daughter in marriage and transferred the congratulatory gift of 5,900 yuan to the scholarship fund. This is also recorded with thanks. Shooting to Arrest Deserters Stray Bullets Kill and Injure Two People 〔Our Newspaper's Report〕At approximately 9 a.m. yesterday, a deserter ran from west to east on Zhonghua Road in Nanshi, followed closely by four soldiers. When turning into the intersection of Yinggong Temple Road, the four soldiers who followed immediately pulled out their guns and fired more than ten shots, hitting the deserter in the chest with one bullet, causing him to fall to the ground and be captured. At the same time, as the bullets flew, stray bullets killed and injured one man and one woman. It was later learned that the deceased was an old woman, Wang Fangshi (72 years old, from Ningbo, living at 985 Zhonghua Road). The injured was Li Jiayu, 18 years old, from Shandong. The injured was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by car. The corpse was taken to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for examination by hearse. The police are ordering police to investigate which unit the deserter belongs to. International Telephone and Telegraph

### 京民生報被誤封　呈請衛戌部啓封

[Local News] When the Nanjing Renbao newspaper was sealed, the furniture, equipment, and machinery originally belonged to the Minsheng Daily. This was because Nanjing Renbao borrowed some furniture from the Minsheng Daily's president, Cheng Shewo (Legislative Yuan member), last year, with a promissory note as proof. The remaining houses, furniture, and other items still belong to the Minsheng Daily. During the execution of the sealing, they were sealed together. Now that the president of the Minsheng Daily has moved south with the Legislative Yuan, the newspaper's administrative director, Mi Zhemin, has submitted a written request to the Garrison Headquarters to lift the seal.

Other privately-owned yarn factories also suffered significant losses.

### 中航籌恢復菲星兩航綫　華南綫視需要隨時增闢

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 5th] According to the person in charge of China Aviation Company (CAC), as domestic routes are becoming shorter, the company is first planning to restore the Manila route. This matter has been approved by the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry has appointed officials to go to the Philippines to reopen negotiations with the Philippine government. As soon as passports are processed, the trip can be made. The company also plans to restore the route from Hong Kong via Bangkok to Singapore, which is still being discussed with the Ministry of Communications for approval. If flying directly from Hong Kong to Singapore, it must pass through Bangkok, which is what the company intends to resume. As for the Batavia route, it cannot be opened for economic reasons. The Australian route still awaits the signing of an aviation agreement between the two countries. Regarding the reporter's inquiry about whether to add South China routes, the person replied: "This is very easy. If there is a need, South China routes can be added at any time." The problem of mutual flights between China and the Philippines was previously shelved because the Philippines insisted that China allow Philippine planes to land in Xiamen, which was not agreed to by the Chinese government. In the past, the route that once implemented mutual flights was the China Aviation aircraft flying from Shanghai via Shantou to Manila, and the Philippine aircraft flying from Manila via Hong Kong to Shanghai. Later, the Philippines requested to add a stop in Xiamen. China believed that the conditions of Xiamen Airport's equipment were not sufficient to become an international airport, so it did not agree. The Philippines then announced that China Aviation aircraft would not be allowed to continue flying to Manila.

### 大西洋公約草案大體完成　下星期內即可公布　規定簽約國如遭侵略一致採制裁行動　挪外長啓程赴美參加討論

The Atlantic Pact Draft is Largely Completed; It Can Be Announced Within the Next Week; It Stipulates that Contracting Countries Will Take Concerted Sanction Actions If Attacked; Norwegian Foreign Minister Departs for the United States to Participate in Discussions

[United Press, Washington, 4th] According to diplomatic sources: The United States and the six countries negotiating the North Atlantic Treaty plan to announce the outline of the treaty's secret provisions next week. They revealed that agreements have been reached on various key points, and the detailed provisions to be revealed are being discussed by the seven countries: the US, Canada, UK, France, Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. According to reliable sources, the treaty will consider an attack on any member state as an attack on all, and take immediate action against the aggressor. This action is not necessarily military intervention, and may take the form of diplomatic and economic sanctions against the aggressor country or army. The previous provision that member states would assist friendly countries with military action has been abandoned due to strong opposition from all participating countries. For example, the United States must obtain special Congressional approval to enter the war. According to the new treaty, the parliaments of each member state can decide whether to participate in the war. The treaty is valid for sixteen years, and will be renewed upon expiration. Under the treaty, a North Atlantic Security Council will be established, but it will not have the power to order member states to participate in the war. The United States began considering this treaty in June of last year. The formal text is expected to be signed by the foreign ministers of the seven draft countries and any countries that decide to join at the end of this month or the beginning of next month. Officials here believe that there is still an opportunity for Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Portugal, and Italy to participate in this treaty before the treaty is formally announced. It is also said that Ireland has no hope of participating at this time. This treaty is the first peacetime alliance between the United States and Western European countries.

[Agence France-Presse, Oslo, 4th] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange is scheduled to leave here tomorrow with the Norwegian Ambassador to the United States. The former leader of the Labor Party parliamentary group and two former Ministry of Defense officials will also accompany him.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] Diplomatic officials said that an important meeting between Norway and the United States regarding the North Atlantic Treaty will begin here soon. They said that the State Department received a note on the afternoon of the 4th, stating that the Norwegian delegation will come to the United States to determine under what conditions Norway may participate in the defense alliance.

[United Press, Ottawa, 4th] Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson said in the House of Commons on the 4th that the rumor that Canada was invited to join the Pacific Alliance was purely "speculation." He said, "No government has made such a suggestion to us, and we are not aware of any suggestions regarding the Pacific Alliance."

### 蘇調整外交陣容　盛傳莫洛托夫將任新職　維辛斯基可能繼任外長

Soviet Union Adjusts Diplomatic Lineup; It Is Rumored That Molotov Will Take a New Position; Vyshinsky May Succeed Him as Foreign Minister

[United Press, Lake Success, 4th] Former colleagues of Gromyko at the United Nations expect this young Deputy Foreign Minister to take on a larger role in the Soviet Foreign Ministry. Since Gromyko retired from Lake Success last summer and returned to Moscow to take on a new position, his activities have become a mystery to most diplomats. Few people here believe that this 39-year-old senior Moscow diplomat will remain unknown for long. It is speculated here that Gromyko will succeed Vyshinsky as the most prestigious First Deputy Foreign Minister. United Nations personnel believe that Foreign Minister Molotov will take on a larger role in the Soviet government.

If Molotov is not the first favorite under Marshal Stalin, he is one of the few on Stalin's right hand, as Molotov has been nominated as one of Stalin's successors. A change in Molotov's position would elevate Vyshinsky to Foreign Minister, if his health allows. United Nations representatives who saw Vyshinsky's actions and eloquence at the recent Paris General Assembly believe that Vyshinsky is the best candidate. An American publisher who recently returned from Moscow said during a visit to the United Nations that he was convinced that Vyshinsky would take the position of Foreign Minister, but the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General and Soviet representative, Sobolev, offered little support for this. United Nations observers believe that it is significant that US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith visited Gromyko for a long talk when he left his post, which indicates that former United Nations representative Gromyko is now responsible for US-Soviet relations in the Moscow Foreign Ministry.
