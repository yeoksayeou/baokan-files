### Truman Announces Marshall's Resignation; Acheson to Succeed as Secretary of State; Policy Towards Soviets Will Not Soften

[Special Dispatch] New York, 7th (Broadcast from Washington): Secretary of State Marshall, due to physical exhaustion following kidney surgery, has requested to resign. President Truman has approved the resignation and appointed Acheson as Secretary of State. Marshall will step down on January 20, the start of Truman's new term. In announcing Marshall's resignation, Truman emphasized that U.S. foreign policy would not change as a result, and that the U.S. would continue to take a firm stance toward the Soviet Union and support the United Nations. Truman specifically stated that the policy towards the Soviets had not softened. The new Secretary of State Acheson, 55, is a man of distinguished appearance who served as Under Secretary of State for many years, resigning six months after Marshall became Secretary of State.

After resigning in June 1947, Acheson resumed his law practice in Washington. Resigning at the same time as Marshall was Under Secretary Lovett, who succeeded Acheson as Under Secretary. Truman stated that Webb, Director of the Budget Bureau, who had served as an advisor in the White House for many years, would succeed as Under Secretary of State, and his vacant position would be filled by the current Deputy Director of the Budget Bureau, Frank. Marshall's forced resignation due to physical exhaustion will bring to an end the era of major U.S. foreign policy decisions that began on January 21, 1947, when Marshall reluctantly took office as Secretary of State. It also marks the end of Marshall's glorious career, which spanned two World Wars. As Chief of Staff, he led the nation's army in the largest war in history.

The President praised Marshall as "America's greatest soldier" and said that approving his resignation was a last resort and "deeply regrettable." Truman told reporters that he considered Marshall an outstanding figure during World War II, and initially believed that Marshall would recover and continue to serve. The appointment of the new Secretary of State is subject to Senate approval, but Acheson is highly respected, and the Democratic Party is in power in the current Congress, so approval is not expected to be a problem. Senators Thomas and Green of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee expressed strong praise after learning of the news.

Acheson issued a statement saying that he was very surprised by the appointment, and that the President had not contacted him beforehand. He said he felt a great responsibility and would do his best. He did not intend to make any changes within the State Department and expressed "excitement" about the President's appointment of Webb as his assistant.

Truman said that Marshall had requested to resign on January 3, and although he hoped he would recover and continue to serve, he did not want to force him to stay and damage his health. Truman strongly denied that there was any difference between the "Forrestal-Marshall-Lovett foreign policy" and Truman's policy, and said that the policy was always formulated by him personally and faithfully implemented by Marshall. As for Lovett's resignation, the President said it was for "personal reasons." The President praised Lovett's achievements as Under Secretary of State.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Bengbu, 7th] Chen Yi's bandit troops, numbering approximately 300,000, in the Si (County) Yong (City) area, launched another attack on our Du Yuming's army corps' positions starting at noon on the 5th.

At the same time, they concentrated artillery fire to bombard us fiercely. More than 50,000 shells landed in one day and night, turning all the bombarded areas into scorched earth. The bandits also fired many crippling and tear gas shells. Due to a lack of medicine, the poisoned officers and soldiers of our defending army could not be treated and suffered heavy casualties, resulting in the breakthrough of several positions. After reinforcements arrived, they fought bravely and counterattacked, and are still engaged in a fierce battle with the bandits in the original positions.

Foreign Reporter Traveling with Him Fortunate to Escape by Lying on the Ground

### United Nations Secretary-General Officially Announces Non-Intervention in China's War; Believes Taking Action Would Not Help the Current Situation

[United Press Dispatch from Lake Success, 6th] United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie declared on the 6th that he had decided not to intervene in the Chinese war. According to an official announcement: Lie had "carefully considered" the matter and could not see that "any action on his part would be helpful to the present situation." The question of whether the United Nations would intervene in the Chinese war was raised at Lie's first press conference on the 5th after his return from the Paris General Assembly meeting. At that time, he said that he would "consider" whether the United Nations could do anything to stop the civil war between the Nationalists and the Communists. The United Nations announced on the 6th: "The Secretary-General has carefully considered this issue, and he believes that his authority to take any action is highly questionable, and that in any case, any action on his part would not be helpful to the present situation."

[United Press Dispatch from Lake Success, 6th] The United Nations Information Office announced on the night of the 6th: United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie has decided not to take any action on the Chinese war. Lie originally intended to answer this question at a press conference next week, but because some staff members of the Secretariat felt that the Secretary-General should immediately announce his position, the above statement was issued on the night of the 6th.

### Zhang Qun to Depart for Hankou Today; Many Rumors About Peace in Nanjing; Negotiations to Invite the U.S., Soviet Union, or Four Powers to Mediate Are About to Take Place

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] The Communist Party has not yet formally responded to the President's New Year's Day message calling for peace. The political circles in the capital remained calm on the 7th, but there were many rumors circulating. Some said that the President would issue another message in the near future, making a further statement about his own advancement or retreat. Others said that the President's decision to stay or leave would be made within ten days. The reporter recently visited a responsible person in political circles and inquired about the above matters. According to the person, all of these were pure rumors and absolutely unreliable. It was also learned that Zhang Qun will leave Nanjing on the 8th. It is said that his destination may be Hankou. This trip is in response to ______.

[United Press Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] Zhang Zhizhong hosted a banquet at noon on the 7th to entertain important officials such as Chen Lifu, during which they discussed the general situation.

[United Press Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] General Zhang Zhizhong continued to be busy on the 7th discussing measures to address the bleak future caused by the Communist Party's informal rejection of peace talks with a large number of officials, including Vice President Li Zongren and former Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun. Zhang Zhizhong told his friends that he still hoped that the CCP could "change its mind" and believed that a peaceful solution could still be achieved.

[Another Dispatch] Senior officials said on the evening of the 7th that the government would soon submit a formal proposal to the United States, the Soviet Union, or the Four Powers to mediate and assist in persuading the Communist Party to accept the government's peace proposals. The official also said that experts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had completed a study of the advantages and disadvantages of inviting the Four Powers to mediate and the procedures for the invitation. This study was ordered by Executive Yuan President Sun Ke. It is understood that the experts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have submitted a report to President Sun on the advantages and disadvantages of inviting the Four Powers to mediate, as well as a memorandum on the invitation procedures.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 7th] Foreign diplomatic circles in the capital believe that United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie's recent announcement that he is studying the current situation in China and considering the possibility of mediating peace talks is very important. Although the political atmosphere here was calm on the 7th, the continuous development of various events makes people feel that there is much that can be done to strive for peace. An international political scholar told reporters that if the United Nations believes that the evolution of the Chinese civil war will endanger the maintenance of world peace, it has the right to consider it in accordance with legal principles. As for the Chinese government submitting this problem that it cannot solve itself to the United Nations and asking to participate in mediation, it is not impossible. However, the opinion of the majority is that the key to international mediation is closely related to the attitude of a certain major power towards the peace issue. They believe that China's only ally also hopes that China's internal disputes can be resolved peacefully, but the country can be expected not to come forward alone. Therefore, the method of United Nations mediation or Four Powers mediation is very likely to become a reality. A diplomatic official also expressed his personal opinion, saying that if the China issue is brought before the United Nations and accepted, the efforts for peace must succeed. If the China issue is only mediated by China itself or its invited allies, the direct impact of its success or failure will only affect the fate of China and the face of its allies. However, if it is made a new issue for the United Nations, its success or failure will be a serious test for the United Nations. How the international community will consider this is worth paying attention to.

### Bullitt Reports to U.S. Foreign Aid Committee, Recommends $800 Million in Aid to China, Urges Speedy Restoration of "Flying Tigers," Tells American Reporters that MacArthur Should Be Sent to Lead Officers to China

[United Press Dispatch from Washington, 6th] Former Ambassador to the Soviet Union William C. Bullitt submitted an appeal from senior Chinese leaders, etc. to the Joint Congressional Committee on Foreign Economic Assistance on the 6th, urging a speedy restoration of the "Flying Tigers" under the leadership of Major General Claire Chennault during the war. Bullitt also requested a "comprehensive" aid to China plan, recommending $800 million in military and economic aid, including the training of new Chinese troops under the supervision of U.S. officers. Bullitt reported to the committee on his recent visit to China. Some committee members warned that Bullitt's testimony might embarrass the government, so they requested a closed-door meeting and got their wish. They insisted that the publication of the report should only be considered as Bullitt's findings, and not express the views of the committee. Bullitt told reporters after the meeting that he believed that the government army could hold the Yangtze River coast to stop the CCP. He also said: "It is late, very late, but not too late." Bullitt's report mentioned the "Flying Tigers." According to sources from the committee, Bullitt conveyed the appeal to rebuild the American Volunteer Air Force. Bullitt told the committee that this would be the most effective and rapid assistance to President Chiang. The $800 million in aid to China plan advocated by Bullitt includes $300 million for training new troops in southern China. The new troops will be trained and equipped by U.S. officers, $100 million for military supplies, $200 million for cotton, coal, gasoline, food, etc., and $100 million worth of silver as military pay for the government army. This plan is not included in Bullitt's official report.

Representative Bridges, chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Foreign Economic Assistance, agreed with the report. He said that the United States was "taking a big risk" of allowing all of Asia to become communist, and said that the U.S. government had not stated "a clear policy to counter communist aggression" in the Far East.

Bullitt's report stated that "in order to reverse the situation in the Chinese war," the United States must send a U.S. "combat general" to take command of the Chinese war and manage it. He believed that President Chiang lacked generals who could handle the overall issues related to dealing with the Communist offensive. Bullitt said that the Communist army numbered more than two million. Other conclusions of Bullitt's report are as follows: (1) Many of the officers above the rank of major under President Chiang are "incompetent and disloyal, especially the generals." (2) If properly trained, fed, and guided, Chinese soldiers are comparable to any soldiers in the world, and many junior officers are particularly outstanding. (3) Economic aid alone can "slightly impede" the Communist conquest of China, but military and economic aid "greatly extends" this development without U.S. guidance and management. (4) In order for China to have any real and lasting achievements, "U.S. guidance and management" is as important as providing aid. Bullitt concluded: "We must recognize that we are at one of the turning points in human history. Our decisions cannot be wrong, because the question is not only about China's independence, but also about America's independence."

[United Press Dispatch from Washington, 6th] Bullitt told reporters on the 6th that the United States should send MacArthur to lead 600 officers to China to help the country's government defeat the Communist army. He believed that MacArthur could complete this task in less time than other generals.

[United Press Dispatch from Tokyo, 7th] Bullitt's proposal on the 6th to ask MacArthur to help China in the war again has not yet had an immediate reaction here, but it is generally believed that this will not happen at present. MacArthur himself remains conservative and silent. Recently, someone has mentioned this to him, and the reply was that MacArthur has no intention of leaving Japan. It is said that MacArthur believes that the situation in China is extremely serious and has long predicted that the CCP will make major progress. People around MacArthur are closely watching the development of the situation. Many American officers privately expressed that giving the Chinese government army sufficient air force can defeat the Communist Party, but whether this aid can be given without the United States strictly controlling the Chinese military is still a very big question. According to people around MacArthur: MacArthur does not intend to accept the position of the late General Stilwell and be subordinate to President Chiang. In any case, MacArthur will not express his position until he receives a formal appointment.

[United Press Dispatch from Washington, 6th] Representative Bridges, Chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Foreign Economic Cooperation, declared today that China accounts for one-quarter of the world's population. It would not be wise for us to allow it to be occupied by the Communist Party without a concrete and positive policy to deal with it. When asked if Bridges knew that the United States would have a new aid to China plan, Bridges replied that he did not know.

U.S. Senator Smith Requests Publication of Wedemeyer Report

[United Press Dispatch from Washington, 6th] Republican Representative Smith, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, today demanded that the government publish the investigation report of former President Truman's special envoy to China, General Albert Wedemeyer, due to the urgent situation in China. Smith said: The Wedemeyer report has never been published. As far as I know, the report pointed out that Secretary of State Marshall's insistence on a policy towards China was completely wrong. Marshall advocated not giving the Chinese government effective assistance and waiting for it to recruit the CCP to organize a coalition government. Wedemeyer also proposed special assistance to President Chiang's army to prevent the CCP from occupying all of China, as is the case today. I believe that Marshall and Truman are responsible for the current situation in China. If the CCP controls the entire China in the future, then the victory that the United States won in the Pacific will be lost. This situation is more tragic than the fall of some Western European countries. Our entire future depends on the Pacific.

Editorial

### Another Protest Against an Armed Japan!

The issue of the United States assisting Japan's rearmament has attracted the attention of various countries in the Far East. In particular, the dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union on this matter has recently become almost a war of words, intensifying day by day. From the perspective of international relations, the United States and the Soviet Union clearly have significant differences in their understanding of the Far East issue. From the standpoint of the Chinese nation, the threat posed by Japan's rearmament to China is the same as the threat felt by the Soviet Union. China and the Soviet Union share the same concerns. Standing on the positions of international relations and the survival of the Chinese nation, we should, without a doubt, once again express our serious protest against the United States' rearmament of Japan!

The United States' unilateral assistance to Japan's recovery is a multifaceted reality, encompassing political, economic, and cultural aspects. The resurgence of Japan's war potential, such as the revival of the military industry and the expansion of police forces, fully symbolizes the revival of the old Japanese militarism. Archibald, a former aide to General MacArthur, submitted a proposal to the US authorities in December of last year, advocating for the establishment of a 150,000-strong Japanese police force to cope with the current dramatic changes in the Far East situation. Later, it was widely rumored that General MacArthur suggested that the United States should take action to rearm Japan, and it was also rumored that General MacArthur ordered the reconstruction of the Japanese army and the rebuilding of roads damaged by the war. Both China and the Soviet Union, valuing these rumors, expressed their condemnation to the United States successively. Pan Youxin, the Soviet ambassador to the United States and representative to the Far Eastern Commission, issued a statement on December 30 questioning the rearmament of Japan, demanding that the United States bring the matter to the Far Eastern Commission for discussion. President Truman immediately issued a statement denying this fact, but Truman did not deny that Archibald and MacArthur had made any suggestions. This was the first round of the dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union on this issue. On the 5th of this month, a meeting of the Allied Council for Japan was held in Tokyo. The Soviet representative, Derevyanko, loudly denounced that Japan was, with the help of the United States, moving towards the goal of building armed forces of 300,000 men. Derevyanko warned that this move would give Japan the equivalent of seventeen infantry divisions, which was the strength Japan had five years before it launched the Northeast Incident in 1931. He further accused the United States of not bringing this fact to the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan for discussion. The US representative, Sebald, immediately defended, arguing that the Soviet representative's estimate was too large and seemed exaggerated, but he could not deny that nothing of the sort was happening. This was the second round of the dispute between the United States and the Soviet Union on this issue.

Judging from the rebuttals between the United States and the Soviet Union as described above, and based on the manifestation of some recent facts, it can be seen that Japan's rearmament has been encouraged by the United States and has begun to be implemented! In our view, this should be a shocking thing. We hope that public opinion and government authorities will take the following steps quickly and effectively regarding the United States' measure of reviving Japanese militarism to express our country's upright position.

First, our opinion leaders and experts on Japanese issues should express a strong protest against Japan's rearmament and intensified armament from a nationalist standpoint. Some Americans believe that helping Japan can stabilize the Far East, which is a very misguided view. If this misconception does not have a new direction, the future Far East position of the United States will inevitably suffer the consequences.

Second, our representatives to the Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan should, based on the spirit of the Potsdam Declaration and the decision of the Far Eastern Commission on basic policies toward Japan, raise a serious protest and opposition to this major event of Japan's rearmament. We have the right and the position to express our country's attitude of protest with a clear banner and a righteous drum. If the United States does not accept the protests of China and the Soviet Union and responds with the fact of assisting Japan's rearmament, then we should express an attitude of non-recognition of the current state of control over Japan. Japan believes that "faits accomplis" can gain recognition in future peace conferences. This is Japan's extravagant hope. As long as our position in the Far Eastern Commission is firm, any "faits accomplis" will have the opportunity to be overturned in the future.

In the past three years, many of the measures taken by the Allied Headquarters to control Japan have gone beyond the track and violated the principles of law. There have been many accusations in world public opinion. We hope that the situation in the Far East will be stabilized as soon as possible, and that the Japanese issue can be thoroughly clarified one day. In short, under a fair and just treaty, we do not oppose Japan's recovery, and we support Japan's recovery. However, we have a firm principle, which is to oppose the revival of Japanese militarism!

### This Year's Salt Tax Revenue Could Reach 10 Billion Gold Yuan; Ad Valorem Collection Has Been Implemented Since New Year's Day

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] The regulations for the salt tax calculation and collection, after the Legislative Yuan completed the legislative process, the salt tax ad valorem collection has been implemented since New Year's Day. According to Wang Fuzhou, Director of the Salt Administration, speaking to reporters on the 7th, the total budget for salt tax revenue for the 38th year was originally 260 million yuan. After the salt tax was changed to ad valorem collection, the total budget for salt tax revenue for the 38th year has been increased twelvefold, changed to 3.12 billion gold yuan. This is still based on the price calculation of last December. If prices continue to rise, the salt tax revenue for this year will reach at least 10 billion gold yuan.

### Our Salt Exports to Japan

Can Obtain 8 Million US Dollars

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 7th] Our country's export of edible salt to Japan, after consultation with the Allied Headquarters, a contract has now been signed.

### Japanese Attempt to Force Overseas Chinese to Pay Taxes; An Overseas Chinese Merchant in Osaka Is Detained; Huang Wanju Is Being Searched for by the Allied Headquarters for a Paper Allocation Case

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Counterintelligence agents of the Allied Headquarters are currently cracking down on two of the richest Taiwanese overseas Chinese in Japan. Wu Baifu, a textile merchant famous in Osaka who donated 10 million yen alone in 1947 to build the only Chinese Engineering College in Japan, is currently being detained on charges of tax evasion. Representatives of our delegation here believe that Wu's detention is the first step in Japan's implementation of greater pressure to force overseas Chinese to pay taxes to the Japanese government in accordance with the regulations of the Allied Headquarters. Counterintelligence agents of the Allied Headquarters are also searching for Huang Wanju, president of the International News Agency. It is reported that Huang has fled elsewhere. He is suspected of engaging in black market transactions with the paper allocated to the agency. Huang recently participated in a 32-member delegation to Taiwan for sightseeing. It is reported that when he left, the Allied Headquarters agents had already seized the account books of his International News Agency. According to the fact that the International News Agency receives 400,000 sheets of allocated paper every day, while its newspaper sales are only 100,000 sheets per day, the Allied Headquarters suspects that he is selling the surplus allocated paper on the black market. Our delegation in Japan is paying close attention to Wu's case, as it involves a wide range. Representatives of our delegation stated that the Japanese government hopes that Wu will pay 8 million yen in taxes in 1947, but Wu assured the Japanese tax collectors that he did not obtain one yen of profit in 1947. Representatives of our delegation continued: "We have repeatedly asked overseas Chinese to pay all ordinary taxes to the Japanese government in accordance with the resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission." The delegation may recently reiterate this order to overseas Chinese in various parts of Japan to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings between the compatriots and the Allied Headquarters. Representatives of our delegation also stated that, according to the regulations of the Far Eastern Commission, overseas Chinese in Japan do not need to pay special taxes such as capital special tax and inheritance tax.

### President Truman Submits Federal Economic Report to New Congress: Requests Authorization to Prevent Price Increases and Expand Social Welfare Programs

[United Press International, Washington, 7th] President Truman on the 7th requested Congressional authorization to prevent all price increases until public consensus on "their legislation" can be obtained. The President submitted the annual report on the federal economy to Congress, based on a review prepared for him by the Council of Economic Advisers. The economic report is largely similar to the federal message he submitted on the 5th, but includes more details. In a lengthy legislative proposal, Truman reiterated his request for a four billion dollar tax increase, stating that the main source of this tax increase should be corporations. He stated that an increase in corporate profit taxes could be adopted without "unduly interfering with the prospect of continued business expansion, and ensuring that profits after taxation and distribution of dividends are sufficient for investment and temporary expenses." Truman also requested an increase in income taxes for the middle and upper classes, property taxes, inheritance taxes, and "additional commodity taxes," requesting control over special prices and related wages, and requesting authorization to order the prevention of price increases for a considerable period of time while entering into a public opinion survey on legislation. Although the President still maintains the theory that "normal collective bargaining will promote reasonable adjustments in wages," he reiterated that Congress should authorize the government to "limit wage adjustments that could undermine maximum prices." He allowed for "careful limitation of federal spending" as another way to help balance the budget. Truman requested: (1) government finances be handled in a way that reduces public debt; (2) continuation of federal regulations on consumer installment credit; (3) temporary expansion of allocation controls on "scarce essential materials" and continuation of priority allocation mechanisms in railway transport; (4) continuation of rent control for at least two years and strengthened supervision; (5) expansion of export controls; (6) expansion of federal power to prevent excessive speculation or manipulation of commodity exchange prices. In another part of the proposal, he requested that several measures be taken to protect "victims of inflation," including expanding the scope of social security and raising the minimum wage from 75 cents per hour (originally set at 40 cents). The majority of other recommendations relate to rural policies, natural resources, international trade, housing issues, education issues, public health issues, etc., and are consistent with those mentioned in his federal message. Truman's report to Congress was accompanied by a review from the Council of Economic Advisers. The review stated that if the United States hopes to maintain its spiritual prestige and world leadership position, it must actively support the hopes of countless people around the world. The review stated that it would be helpful and hoped that the United States would import manufactured goods from other countries, and that it is also necessary to invest abroad to help them produce, but other countries must "provide appropriate security guarantees" for the funds provided in order to obtain large loans.

### Negev Front: Jewish and Egyptian Armies Ceasefire as Ordered from Yesterday Afternoon: Peace Talks to Be Held Under UN Assistance

[Agence France-Presse, Tel Aviv, 7th] Israeli Prime Minister Ben-Gurion ordered a ceasefire on the Negev front to begin at 2:00 PM today (local time).

[United Press International, Lake Success, 6th] Acting UN Mediator Ralph Bunche announced: Israel and Egypt have agreed to an immediate ceasefire to begin peace talks "as early as possible." The war in the Negev region was originally scheduled to cease at 2:00 PM on the 6th (GMT), but due to telecommunications delays, Bunche telegraphed both Israel and Egypt, requesting that they set noon on the 7th (8:00 PM Shanghai time on the 7th) as the final ceasefire deadline. UN officials say the sudden end to the long-standing Israeli-Egyptian stalemate may be a prelude to a final peaceful resolution of the entire Middle East. Bunche said that Israel has agreed to direct negotiations on Egypt's proposed ceasefire and peace plan, that the UN will participate in and assist in overseeing the matter, and that the time and location of the peace talks are yet to be determined. UN officials pointed out that the Israeli-Egyptian agreement does not mean that the two governments have agreed to a genuine peace. Its achievement was due to secret contacts between UN officials in Cairo and Tel Aviv. The agreement stipulates that the Egyptian and Israeli governments will simultaneously negotiate (1) the Security Council's order issued to both the Arab and Jewish sides on November 16 of last year requesting peace; (2) the withdrawal of Jewish troops from the Negev region to the boundaries occupied before the outbreak of war on October 14 of last year. The UN acknowledges that there are many issues that Israel and Egypt cannot agree on. Bunche said that this development has greatly encouraged him, and that he hopes this negotiation can achieve lasting peace in the Holy Land.

### Labor-Management Discord at the Park Hotel: Employees Appeal for Protection

[Reported by This Newspaper] All employees of the Park Hotel in the city have recently appealed to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Restaurant Industry Workers Union, accusing the hotel manager, Lin Mianzhi, of abusing his power and oppressing employees, and requesting protection. The content of their appeal is as follows: (1) According to the labor-management agreement approved by the Social Affairs Bureau, the hotel was originally required to contribute 25% of its total monthly revenue as a living allowance for all employees, and to issue an additional one picul of rice allowance. However, the hotel recently changed the rice allowance to a bonus and did not issue it according to the fixed amount, violating the agreement and arbitrarily exploiting employees. (2) Gu Zhouxuan, the floor supervisor of the hotel's housekeeping department, was fined half a picul of rice allowance and 15 yuan of basic salary by the hotel manager for the crime of "allowing guests to gamble," and was demoted three levels. Gu argued that the guests brought their own gambling equipment, and he had no right to interfere. Furthermore, in the past, he had repeatedly reported guests gambling, but the manager had ignored it. Therefore, he believes that the punishment was inappropriate and that he was being deliberately singled out. (3) Weng Zutong, a worker in the hotel's inspection department, was suspended from his job due to a minor dispute between colleagues. He believes that this is a major punishment according to the hotel's historical regulations. Currently, all employees of the Park Hotel have formed a fellows' group and have indicated that they are determined to fight to the end for the above three matters. If there is no satisfactory result, they may consider going on strike.

No ceremony was held at Longhua Airport, and the aircraft had no special decorations, appearing like any ordinary commercial flight. Besides passengers, those on board the flight to Japan included a press delegation from Tai City, this newspaper's Deputy Editor-in-Chief Bu Shaofu, Xinwen Bao reporter Yao Yongtai, Director of the English Department of the Central News Agency Qian Yushen, Chief Correspondent of Yi Shi Bao Yin Xueman, and Section Chief Yuan Mingqing from the Shanghai Office of the Government Information Office.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 7th] China Airlines’ Hong Kong-Tokyo route officially opened today. The four-engine Skymaster was piloted by former wartime pilots who flew over the “Hump,” and arrived here at 7:50 PM. A large crowd of welcoming personnel was present. Two Japanese women in kimonos presented flowers to the two Chinese flight attendants to express their welcome. The entire journey took only ten and a half hours, including a one-hour stopover in Shanghai. According to Mr. Zeng, the company representative on board, the new route connects with China Airlines’ existing transportation network, allowing travel from Tokyo to any major city in China within a few hours. In addition to the five journalists, the passengers included Chinese businessmen and members of the Chinese delegation stationed in Japan. The plane will return to Hong Kong tomorrow, and the return passengers will include two Chinese citizens and one Indian citizen. According to Mr. Zeng, the company representative, initial operations are expected to be unprofitable, as the Allied Headquarters prohibits Japanese citizens from traveling to China or through China to Hong Kong. However, its importance lies not in profitability but in pioneering air transportation between China and Japan. He added that the plane will fly from Hong Kong to Tokyo every Friday, with the return flight the next day. The one-way fare is US$226, but those purchasing round-trip tickets will receive a 10% discount.

### Lack of Vehicles Causes Overcrowding on Both Lines Again; Shanghai-Hangzhou Dispatch Office Relocates to Hangzhou

[Our Report] The Jinghu (Nanjing-Shanghai) Railway Administration, recently recognizing the increasing complexity of vehicle dispatch on the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines, the significant increase in train arrivals and departures at Hangzhou Station, and the shift in transportation focus from Shanghai to Hangzhou due to the current situation, the Transportation Department of the Administration, after careful consideration, resolutely decided to relocate the Shanghai-Hangzhou Dispatch Office to Hangzhou. It is reported that Mr. Wu Xizhang, the director of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Dispatch Office, along with more than twenty employees, arrived in Hangzhou yesterday and will begin operations today.

Since the tensions in Xuzhou and Subeng, and the evacuation of dependents of public and religious personnel from the capital, Jinghu Railway vehicles have been transporting dependents of public and religious personnel, displaced students, and important government goods. They traveled south on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway via the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Most of these vehicles were retained by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi or Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) Railways upon reaching their destinations, with very few returning. Consequently, there is an extreme shortage of vehicles on both lines recently, and the number of vehicles attached to all trains in both directions has had to be drastically reduced. This has resulted in the reappearance of passenger overcrowding, with passengers again occupying the roofs and areas around the locomotives. According to railway administration statistics, as of the 5th of this month, a total of 1,007 vehicles have traveled south, including 845 freight cars (carrying 20,156 tons) and 162 passenger cars. Only 20 passenger cars have returned. If these vehicles cannot be returned, the passenger overcrowding on both lines cannot be alleviated in the short term.

### Six Airlines Fight for Rights, Protest; Dissatisfied with Sole Carrier of International Refugees; Civil Aviation Administration Invites Representatives to Negotiate, Ending in Discord

[Our Report] Six major commercial airlines in this city, including China, Pan American, Northwest, Dutch, French, and Hong Kong, have expressed dissatisfaction with the International Refugee Organization (IRO) exclusively contracting with the American-owned Trans Ocean Airlines to transport international refugees in China. They requested the IRO to grant them the right to carry refugees. When their request was not fulfilled, the six airlines appealed to the Civil Aviation Administration (CAA). The CAA first ordered the suspension of Trans Ocean Airlines flights and then dispatched Mr. Xiao Likun, Director of the CAA's Business Department, to Shanghai yesterday to invite representatives from the airlines and the IRO to hear both sides' arguments and make a fair judgment. The discussion was held at 3:00 PM in the China Airlines reception room. Representatives from the IRO and Trans Ocean Airlines, along with representatives from Pan American China and the other five airlines, engaged in heated debate. The IRO representative even stated that the CAA had no right to intervene in this matter, and that if airlines wanted to contract to transport refugees, they should negotiate directly with the IRO. The IRO's choice of carriers is determined by its headquarters in Geneva. However, representatives from Pan American and the other five airlines argued that they all have regular routes, while Trans Ocean Airlines does not. Therefore, they should have priority for carriage, or at least enjoy equal opportunity. The IRO ignored their requests. The discussion ended in discord after a long debate. According to Mr. Xiao, Director of the CAA, the matter will be referred to Nanjing for a decision on how to handle it. The CAA has no bias and is only intervening because the six airlines filed an appeal. According to those familiar with the matter, the IRO contracted with Trans Ocean Airlines for US$250,000, with an additional 7% fee for each refugee airlifted, with adjustments made for any difference in cost. The profit margin is very generous, so the major airlines all want to share in the spoils.

### Banking and Trust Industries Issue Joint Telegram Calling for Peace

The Shanghai Banking, Money, and Trust Industries Joint Council recently issued a telegram calling for peace. The original text is as follows: To President Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, Mr. Mao Zedong in Yan'an, and all national organizations and newspapers: Since the failure of political consultations, the flames of war have spread from north to south. Sacrificing countless properties and lives for the sake of the front line to fight over walled cities. It has been over two years, shaking the foundations of the nation and scattering the people's hearts. Prominent figures in society and university professors have long been calling for peace, their voices hoarse. Now President Chiang has issued a New Year's message, also calling for peace, and stating that personal concerns are not considered, which is sincerely and obvious. Mr. Mao flew to Chongqing at the beginning of the political consultations to discuss national affairs. Although there were setbacks and it was not successful, his sincere desire for peace was also seen by the people of the country. They should abandon preconceptions, party affiliations, and all other selfish considerations, immediately cease fire, select representatives to jointly discuss national affairs, and alleviate the suffering of our 450 million compatriots. Some say that peace is more difficult than war and that it may not lead to results. However, the so-called difficulty is due to a lack of sincerity. If there is sincerity, what difficulty is there? Moreover, from the people's perspective, wherever war reaches, homes are destroyed, and in besieged cities, everything is lost. Requisitioning grain leaves the granaries empty, and it is difficult to recruit soldiers. Refugees fill the roads, and corpses fill the ravines. Not only is war more difficult than peace, but it is also unbearable and unspeakable. We in the financial industry have suffered unspeakable effects from the war. If peace is not achieved quickly, we will all perish. Therefore, we send this special telegram, hoping that our sincere hearts will resonate with all levels of the nation to promote peace talks. Then, the people will be fortunate, and our industry will be even more fortunate. Li Ming, Chairman of the Shanghai Banking Association, Shen Rixin, Chairman of the Shanghai Money Industry Association, Yan Chengde, Acting Chairman of the Trust Industry Association, and all members of the three associations respectfully appeal.

### Money Supply Loosens, Sales Active; Bai Geng Reaches the 800 Mark Again; Flour, Cooking Oil, and Grains All Rise

The rice market rose again yesterday. Although there were many arrivals, prices changed on the household ration system. Market sentiments revitalized, inventory holders pushed up prices, and the money supply loosened again. Major rice shops had high demand, and the market increased by 40-50 yuan at the opening. After the middle of the day, rice shops had fulfilled their demand, so the market relaxed slightly, and prices fell 5-10 yuan at the close. Bai Geng reached 800 yuan again, an increase of 40 yuan. Bo Dao (thin rice) exceeded 800 yuan, reaching 820 yuan, an increase of 50 yuan. Glutinous rice was in high demand due to year-end sales, and the market was especially brisk. Bai Yuan rose above 900 yuan, reaching 930 yuan, also an increase of 50 yuan. In the northern market, Bai Geng and Bo Dao were both 800 yuan, with all rice prices rising 40-50 yuan. Total arrivals in the two markets were 12,921 shi.

Flour: Prices rebounded due to a loosening of the money supply, rising rice prices, and rising prices of goods outside the stock exchange. Market sentiments were also bullish, and the market was very firm at the opening, so opening prices were quite high. Lao Che brand flour opened at 365 yuan, and Bing Chuan brand opened at 355 yuan. Later, the market turned downward due to selling at high prices. Lao Che closed at 347 yuan, an increase of 12 yuan. Bing Chuan closed 3 yuan lower because the previous day's price was too high. Hong Feng and Jiancheng both rose 7-8 yuan. Bran rose 15-16 yuan.

Cooking Oil: Prices rebounded sharply due to a loosening of the money supply and renewed buying by small investors. Coupled with rising prices of goods outside the stock exchange and bullish market sentiments, the market was especially brisk. Soybean oil initially opened at 2,800 yuan, then exceeded 3,000 yuan, and finally reached 3,100 yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 2,900 yuan, an increase of 450 yuan, a rise of 15%. Ji Tong brand rapeseed oil closed at 3,100 yuan, an increase of 400 yuan. Small investors rushed to buy soybean cake, and the market turned brisk. Chang Zi brand closed at 250 yuan, an increase of 50 yuan.

Grains: Prices were uniformly firm. Yellow soybeans were bought aggressively by oil factories due to the loosening money supply. Hankou Che Dou rose 80 yuan, closing at 560 yuan. Zha Dou rose sharply by half, and Pinghu Du Dou rose by 10%. Corn rose first and then fell. Stockholders held onto shelled peanuts, and out-of-town buyers remained cautious. Transactions were slow to open, and the closing saw more transactions. Sesame sales were weak, and the market fluctuated. Other commodities such as Yuan wheat, mung beans, and red sorghum all rose.

### Increased Capital of Brokers Officially Available for Use Today

[Our Report] As of yesterday, the Gold Management Bureau approved approximately 4.3 million Gold Yuan regarding the application to use the increased capital of the brokers. It is expected that this will be officially available for use today. However, the amount used for the first application may not exceed one-third of the deposited funds, the second application may use two-thirds of the remaining amount, and the third application may use the full amount. The term is usually one week or ten days, and may not exceed one month.

### National Bank Raises Interest Rates

[Our Report] Due to market fluctuations and high underground interest rates, the Central Bank raised its rediscount and interbank lending rates yesterday. The daily rediscount rate has been changed to 19.33 Gold Yuan per 1,000 Yuan (previously 11.33 Yuan). The daily interbank lending rate has been changed to 16 Yuan per 1,000 Yuan (previously 9.6 Yuan).

### Increased Idle Capital in the Market Leads to Sharp Decline in Bank Deposits

[Special Dispatch] Due to recent price fluctuations, bank deposits have once again sharply declined. According to financial circles, since the New Year, reserves have been flowing out rapidly, with many customers withdrawing cash from various banks daily. It is estimated that the total deposits in banks citywide are less than 400 million Gold Yuan. Due to the current situation, funds from other areas are also flowing into this city, and it is estimated that the idle capital in the market is no less than 1.5 billion yuan. This batch of funds is circulating outside the financial circles, which has a significant impact on prices. Although the authorities are paying close attention to this, there are still no effective countermeasures. In addition, according to the Gold Control Bureau, the current influx of idle capital is closely related to price fluctuations. The bureau is now paying close attention to the business of the banks, and will conduct regular inspections of their accounts. Those found to be engaged in activities outside of their permitted business will be severely punished.

### Remittances Gradually Released, Easing Credit Conditions

Credit conditions are trending towards easing amidst stability. The underground interest rates in various industries and markets opened at around forty cents in the morning. However, due to strong buying interest and urgent demand for funds from all parties, underground interest rates rose, eventually stabilizing at around fifty cents by noon.

In other news, credit conditions are mixed. Various non-financial groups have urgent needs, but the supply of funds has slightly improved because the central bank has released a portion of remittances from other areas. The shortage of funds within the industry has improved. Market interbank lending rates vary, with the highest reaching 50 yuan for overnight loans and the lowest at 40 yuan, equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 1.20 to 1.50 yuan. General observations suggest that credit conditions will ease next week, as some industrial loans are about to be issued and idle capital will be heavily concentrated.

Yesterday, the availability of cash was tight, especially for large bills. Various banks restricted the amount of cash withdrawals, ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 yuan. Premiums occurred in the market.

### Overseas Remittance Rates Remain Unchanged

The exchange rate for overseas remittances has been 130 yuan for several days. According to relevant authorities, the gold price must include a balancing fee based on the overseas remittance rate. Adjusting the overseas remittance rate would increase the gold price and stimulate commodity prices. Therefore, the relevant authorities are extremely cautious about adjusting the overseas remittance rate. It is generally expected that if the authorities fix the overseas remittance rate at one point, it will sacrifice overseas remittances. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the effectiveness of absorbing overseas remittances through posting rates in the past has not been significant.

### Loan Discount Committee Holds Meeting, Approves Fourteen Loan Applications

[Special Dispatch] The Industrial and Mining Advisory Committee of the Central Bank Loan Discount Committee held its 24th meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. More than 20 people, including Zhu Tongjiu and Zhi Bingyuan, attended. They discussed 17 loan applications related to public utilities, transportation, mining, salt transport, papermaking, matches, raw materials, and other industries. In addition to applications that were rejected or required further investigation, a total of 14 were approved. All of the above cases must be submitted to the next Loan Discount Committee for approval. In addition, the Export and Production Enterprise Loan Review Committee postponed its meeting, originally scheduled to be held after the Industrial and Mining Committee adjourned, to 3:00 PM today.

### Food Prices Continue to be Buoyant

Yesterday, the sugar market was active because credit conditions remained tight, and holders sold off, leading to a trend of initially soft prices followed by a rise. At the close, prices uniformly increased. No. 45 sugar closed at 2080 yuan, up 330 yuan. Prices for all other grades rose uniformly by more than 20%.

### Silk Prices Soar

The raw silk market showed strength again yesterday. Credit conditions were tight within the industry, but due to the rise in the financial securities and other markets, buying interest was strong, and prices for all grades reached new highs.

After No. 120 Tianqiao was offered at a high of 58,000 yuan, there was strong demand from intermediaries, pushing the offer price up another 2,000 yuan. Subsequently, large firms covered short positions and sold at high prices, softening the market slightly. The morning session closed at 55,000 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors of a sharp jump in the black market for gold and cash stimulated sentiment. The over-the-counter market took the opportunity to push up prices, with retail investors actively buying. The market showed a uniformly high peak, with Tianqiao offered at 65,000 yuan and Dongyang at 67,000 yuan, significantly higher than the morning session.

The price of foreign exchange transfer certificates for raw silk has not improved, and exports have not moved. Foreign firms are satisfied with their profits and have little interest in imports. Domestic sales initially showed strength due to rising yarn prices, but after hearing that the financial black market was rising again, the market became even stronger. Superior grade silk opened at 61,000 yuan in the morning and rose to 63,000 yuan at the close. The future trend is expected to remain buoyant, with the offer price increasing by another 5,000 yuan.

The silk fabric market initially rose and then fell yesterday. Sentiments among industry participants varied, and their targets differed. Credit conditions in the market tightened, and underground interest rates rose. Many speculators released goods to profit from interest, leading to continuous sales. The market was dominated by selling. After Meiya bedsheets opened at a high of 34,200 yuan, the rising momentum became too sharp. Large firms sold off at high prices, causing the market to decline immediately. Subsequently, after learning that the yarn market did not decline and that Chinese stocks rose, sentiment was restored. Prices then gradually rose slightly. Meiya closed at 33,200 yuan, and Huaqiang at 33,000 yuan, both higher than the previous day.

### Little Fluctuation in the Tea Market

Yesterday, the tea market initially showed frequent excitement due to reports of easing credit conditions and the rebound of various goods outside the circle, leading to the sellers' intention to raise prices. The trend took on a different color. However, the buyers, considering that the funds have not yet been fully settled, coupled with an unwillingness to urgently seek high prices, suddenly softened the process, and the price has no ability to rise, but moved downstream step by step, and the final result at the end of the day was much the same as the previous day, without much ups and downs, and the trading continued to present a morning star state.

### Tung Oil Firm and Stable

Since the tung oil trend turned from circuitous to virtual the day before, the market trend in the tung oil market yesterday suddenly became relaxed because of the easing of credit, so the goods holding mentality was suddenly pulled up, and the attitude recovered and sprouted to defend, so although the buying interest from all parties was still very small, the chassis was more stable than before, and the future has no signs of shaking.

### Yarn and Cloth Market Prices Continue to Soar

The rising trend of cotton yarn has risen again, Cantonese transactions are active, people's minds are excited, and those who hold goods are unanimously optimistic, so yesterday's market conditions returned to a state of madness. Market prices skyrocketed. 42-count Blue Phoenix fell from 58,000 yuan to 56,000 yuan, and closed at 58,500 yuan at noon, a sharp increase of 8,500 yuan compared to the previous. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 8,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened at 45,500 yuan, reaching a high of 47,000 yuan in the middle, and closed at 46,500 yuan, up 6,500 yuan. 21-count Shuangma spot goods initially opened at a low of 38,000 yuan, with a maximum of 42,500 yuan, and closed at 41,500 yuan at noon, a final increase of 7,300 yuan, and factory orders at 37,500 yuan. 20-count Shuangma closed from 32,500 yuan to 34,500 yuan, an increase of 4,500 yuan. The 16-count and below grades all rose by about 3,000 yuan.

The cloth market, with a slight easing of credit, the absorption of customers has become stronger, the buying wind is very strong, the trend has suddenly turned to fast profit, and market prices have risen slowly. The fine cloth stalls are quite active due to the fact that the spinning construction company has not been selling for a long time, resulting in a dry chip on the market. Longtou fine cloth initially saw a new high price of 1,550 yuan, although it was shouted down to 1,470 yuan in the middle, but it returned to 1,540 yuan at noon, resulting in a final increase of 190 yuan. Only Tianjin Factory 32 Wufu and Qingdao Factory Da Shuanglong were sold in the medium-grade fine cloth, and there was no supply of other products such as Laba Tong Wufu. Sijunzi Yuan Biji retreated from 1,400 yuan to a minimum of 1,360 yuan, and turned firm and strong at the end, ending with 1,420 yuan, up 180 yuan. Sijunzi Yuan Zhigong started well, 170 yuan, and closed with 1,460 yuan for cloth. The factory's opening prices have mostly increased by about 100 yuan.
