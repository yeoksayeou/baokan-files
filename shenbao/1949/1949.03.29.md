### Negotiations Await Agreement on Procedures: Both Sides' Representatives to First Hold Preparatory Meeting; Government Requests Suspension of Military Operations

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Government peace talks representative Zhang Zhizhong, at 5:00 PM on the 28th, in response to reporters' inquiries about the prospects of the peace talks, expressed optimism, his tone being: "I have always been optimistic." However, he declined to explain the reasons for his optimism. He also declined to reveal the procedures for the upcoming peace talks in Peiping and the government's handling of the CCP's eight conditions. Zhang stated: "I cannot comment on this, as I fear it will affect the progress of the peace talks. However, after the delegation arrives in Peiping, a preparatory meeting will be held first, so the procedures are currently difficult to predict." Zhang smiled broadly and showed little sign of worry during the conversation. When asked about the duration of his trip, Zhang had no pre-planned estimate. Regarding whether he would have to travel between Peiping and Nanjing for instructions, he said: "It depends on the circumstances." Regarding the discussion of war criminals and whether to discuss a ceasefire first, as well as the constitution and legal authority, Zhang appeared to find it difficult to explain.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Before the start of the KMT-CCP peace talks, Huang Qihan, the representative of Acting President Li in Peiping responsible for liaison with the CCP, frequently communicated with the Presidential Office. It is said that under Huang's communication, some issues have made smooth progress. About two days ago, Nanjing, through this bridge, proposed to the CCP to temporarily suspend military operations during the peace talks. This request did not receive a direct response, but responsible individuals believe that the fighting in Anqing near the capital, which has become apparent on the 28th, means that the Communist army in Anqing has already taken the initiative to withdraw. This is enough to demonstrate the CCP's sincerity in the peace talks, which indicates that the upcoming peace talks may have optimistic omens. Furthermore, future contact between the peace talks representatives in Peiping will be communicated to Nanjing every day, and any results obtained will be submitted to Nanjing for research and discussion before contacting Peiping again. On the evening of the 28th, an authoritative source stated: Currently, the Kuomintang is striving for unity and a unified will to ensure the smooth progress of the peace talks in Peiping. This unity and unification, the authoritative source believes, is very much in hand.

[Our Newspaper] Peace talks representative Huang Shaohong arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong by plane at 5:00 PM yesterday evening and took a train to Nanjing that night. Huang declined to speculate on the prospects of the peace talks. Regarding the difficulties in the peace talks, he said: In his personal opinion, war criminals are a difficult problem, and the issue of military reorganization is particularly sensitive and difficult. However, the key lies in the sincerity of both sides. With sincerity, big problems can be turned into small ones; without sincerity, small problems can be turned into big ones. When asked whether the outcome of the future peace talks would be approved by the Kuomintang's highest decision-making body, he replied: "That has been the practice in the past." When asked about Guangzhou's view of the peace talks, Huang said he did not know but said: "The decision on a matter should be based on the majority, regardless of location."

[Our Newspaper] Zhang Shizhao returned to Shanghai yesterday morning to attend to private matters and is scheduled to go to Nanjing again tonight, awaiting orders to fly to Peiping. It is said that the date for the peace representatives to fly to Peiping is either the 31st of this month or April 1st, depending on the weather. In the past two days, the peace talks representatives and the government authorities have had informal consultations, not, as rumored, participating in military meetings. The report that Xu Yongchang and Gu Zhutong attended the meeting is particularly inconsistent with the facts.

[United Press, Nanjing, 28th] The government has formally notified the CCP that the peace delegation will fly to Peiping on the 31st. The Communist side has designated the Six Nations Hotel as the delegation's residence and has arranged wireless communication between Peiping and Nanjing. It is said that at the start of the peace talks on April 1st, the delegation will ask the Communist side to announce an unconditional ceasefire.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 28th] Government leaders were still busy meeting on the 28th. It is understood that preparations for the peace talks have been virtually completed. Acting President Li, Premier He Yingqin, and peace talks representatives are now scheduling meetings with legislators, supervisors, members of the KMT Central Political Committee, and members of the Central Executive Committee to solicit their opinions and achieve internal unity within the government.

### Presidential Office Held Meeting Yesterday: Presidents of the Executive, Legislative, and Supervisory Yuans, and Peace Talks Representatives All Attended; Discussions Focused on the United Nations and Peace Talks

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Amid preparations for peace talks with the CCP, Acting President Li convened a discussion meeting at the Presidential Office at 8:00 PM on the 28th, gathering the presidents of the Executive, Legislative, and Supervisory Yuans, as well as some legislators and peace talks representatives, to discuss various issues related to the peace talks. The peace program previously drafted by the government's ten-member committee was also presented again for item-by-item discussion, with attendees expressing their opinions extensively as a reference for the peace talks representatives' trip to Peiping. The meeting lasted until 12:00 AM. After the meeting, it was agreed that no information should be disclosed to the outside world. Reporters visited President Yu Youren and Shao Lizi to inquire about the content of the meeting. Both only stated that the discussion related to strengthening ties among the Legislative, Supervisory, and Executive Yuans, and the peace talks were also touched upon, but the content could not be revealed. Attendees at today's discussion meeting included He Yingqin, Yu Youren, Tong Guanxian, Liu Jianhua, Qiu Changwei, Peng Zhaoxian, Wang Qijiang, Fan Yushui, Gan Jiaxin, Cheng Siyuan, Yin Shuxian, Huang Yuren, and Chen Kewen.

### Authoritative Source Discusses Peace Talks: Time Limit of at Most One Month

Difficult Issues Still Require Instructions from Nanjing

[Our Newspaper] According to authoritative sources, the KMT-CCP peace talks in Peiping this time will last for at most about a month. The representatives do not have full authority and must seek instructions from Nanjing at any time when encountering difficult issues. There is no plan for the delegation to visit Xikou to visit Chiang before flying to Peiping. The government representatives did not bring a plan on this trip. The plan planned by the Ten-Member Committee has long been aborted in fact. Therefore, technically, the representatives are only responsible to Nanjing for each point of the agreement. How the opinions of other parties within the Kuomintang will be unified is a matter for the government and has nothing to do with the peace talks representatives. Shao Lizi's pessimistic attitude towards the peace talks stems from this, as he is deeply afraid that the peaceful views of the capital may not be accepted by other parties within the party. As for the outside world's deep fear that the CCP's insistence on eight points will lead to the breakdown of the peace talks, relevant people believe that there is no need to be overly pessimistic because "the CCP's market changes sooner or later." The CCP is the most realistic political party, and its policies are revised at any time according to the environment and will never take a dead end. Since taking over Peiping and Tianjin, they have discovered serious difficulties, so their attitude may have changed compared with two months ago. However, what is worth worrying about is that several military leaders of the CCP are strongly advocating taking advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reduce the remaining strength of the National Army to avoid prolonged peace talks and give the National Army a chance to recover. On the government side, even those who advocate peace the most often remember the maxim "only by being able to fight can there be peace." Therefore, the future of the peace talks will only be known after the talks begin. As for the recent military actions of the Communist army in Jiangbei, when the Shanghai peace delegation went to Peiping, the Chinese leader had stated: Even if the peace talks are reopened, he cannot restrict his military actions north of the Yangtze River, but he believes that the offensive to cross the river will not be launched during the peace talks.

### Friendly Encirclement of Zhang Zhizhong: Inquiring About News of Peace Talks

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] Zhang Zhizhong held a tea party at Jieshou Hall at 4:00 PM on the 28th, inviting friends, about a hundred people in attendance. Zhang, as a popular figure in the current peace talks, was repeatedly surrounded by guests inquiring about news of the peace talks. Some even arrived without receiving an invitation. For a time, there was much talking and laughing, coupled with Zhang's humorous tone, creating a very harmonious atmosphere.

### Fan Yunong and Others to Suggest: Suspending Legislative Yuan During Peace Talks

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 28th] Legislator Fan Yushui and others are launching a proposal on the 28th, requesting the Legislative Yuan to adjourn during the peace talks. According to Fan, the adjournment of the Legislative Yuan will be conducive to the progress of the peace talks, as incautious remarks in the Yuan's meetings may affect the progress of the peace talks.

### Internal Affairs Committee of Legislative Yuan Reviews: Simplification of Provincial-Level Organizations Case

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The Internal Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 28th to review the "Simplification of Provincial-Level Administrative Organizations" case proposed by Meng Yunqiao and others. Luo Gonghua chaired, and Internal Affairs Counselor Wang Ting attended to report on the organizational status of the provincial government before leaving. The committee members began reviewing, agreeing in principle. However, regarding the second item of the proposal, "In the Communist-occupied areas of the province, where the provincial government has little business, efforts should be made to tighten up and reduce the burden on the national treasury. The four departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction, and the Accounting Office need not be established separately. Only a Secretariat Office is temporarily allowed to be established to manage various affairs in sections, and other institutions "should be merged," they believed that the Executive Yuan should be requested to pay attention and recommended Zheng Zhenyu to report to the next Yuan meeting.

### Yu Youren Dispels Intention to Resign: Supervisory Yuan Annual Meeting Scheduled to Close This Afternoon

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] After Supervisory Yuan President Yu Youren sent a letter to all supervisors requesting his resignation, all supervisors repeatedly and earnestly urged him to stay and requested to advance and retreat together to dispel his intention to resign. As a result, Yu dispelled his intention to resign on the 28th in consideration of the difficult times and to avoid causing unrest in the Supervisory Yuan due to his resignation. He personally went to preside over the Supervisory Yuan General Assembly. At noon, he and Vice President Liu Zhe hosted a banquet for all supervisors at the International Friendship Club. Each supervisor offered a toast to Yu, as Yu had dispelled his intention to resign. The guests and hosts were very happy, and the banquet did not end until 2:00 PM.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] This year's annual meeting of the Supervisory Yuan is scheduled to close at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 29th. President Yu Youren will personally deliver the closing remarks. According to a secretary responsible for drafting the content of the remarks, the main point is to explain the Supervisory Yuan's wishes for promoting peace and innovating politics. As for the so-called legal authority issue, it should be decided by the people's opinions. In addition, the motives for his resignation and the process of dispelling his intention to resign will also be explained. After the closing of the Supervisory Yuan's annual meeting, each supervisor will leave Nanjing and return to various places. The Supervisory Yuan Secretariat has negotiated with the airline to charter three special planes to send each supervisor to Taiwan, Guangzhou, and Chongqing.

### Memorial for Revolutionary Martyrs: Central Government Holds Spring Ceremony

### Releasing News of Peace Talks: To Adopt Communique Format; Whether Reporters Can Accompany to Peiping Awaits Study

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] When Zhang Zhizhong met with reporters on the 28th, the reporters requested Zhang to allow them to accompany him to Peiping to cover the news of the peace talks. Zhang replied that he would discuss it with the CCP when he went to Peiping. If possible, he would welcome everyone to go. However, the release of this news will definitely adopt a communique format and be unified.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 28th] A senior official said: The government is considering suggesting to the CCP to allow Chinese and foreign reporters to go to Peiping to exclusively cover and release news of the peace talks, without restrictions or censorship, to avoid the CCP monopolizing the news of the peace talks.

### CCP Youth League: Strongly Attacks the United States

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 28th] The CCP on the 28th stood with the Soviet Union "in peace or war" and, amid calls for peace, launched new attacks on the United States. The CCP's broadcast in Peiping claimed that the Soviet Union was the only peaceful country. Whether this second attempt to end China's civil war politically since World War II will succeed is still not clearly optimistic. In Peiping, the CCP Party, the Youth League, strongly attacked the United States and pledged to fight alongside the Soviet Union in another war as a tribute to the World Peace Congress scheduled to be held in Paris in April. The Youth League stated that the League wanted to point out that "US imperialism is the main culprit in causing war." The League declared: The peaceful method is to "strengthen the democratic front led by the Soviet Union and fight with greater determination against the international reactionary group headed by US imperialism. The Chinese people and youth have established the closest and strongest revolutionary friendship with the Soviet people and youth in the past thirty years. Whether in peacetime or wartime, we will stand on the same front with the Soviet Union and all democratic countries."

### Candidates for Vacancies of Grand Justices and Examination Committee Members: Supervisory Yuan Has Agreed; Intense Debate Arose Due to Absence of Women

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] The Supervisory Yuan held a general meeting on the morning of the 28th to review the candidates for the vacancies of Grand Justices and Examination Committee members nominated by Acting President Li for the Supervisory Yuan's consent. The general meeting held a general meeting in the afternoon to exercise the right of consent. The voting results showed that each candidate received more than half of the votes of the attending members, obtaining the consent of the Supervisory Yuan. Chen Jianxiao's nomination as a member of the Examination Committee was criticized and opposed by the members, and he was almost canceled. Chen only received 56 consent votes, only three more than the required majority consent votes. Fortunately, he was approved. The results were immediately communicated to the Acting President in writing by the Supervisory Yuan so that he could formally submit the appointments. The list of Grand Justices and Old Examination Committee members nominated by Acting President Li and approved by the Supervisory Yuan is as follows:

Grand Justices (eight): Xia Qin, Weng Jingtang, Ye Zaijun, Li Haopei, Mei Ru'ao, Xiang Zhejun, Wei Datong, Su Xixun.

Examination Committee members (nine): Liu Yizheng, Zhang Qiyun, Gao Yihan, Chen Jianxiao, Ai Wei, Deng Hongfan, Ma Shiru, Shui Zi, Zhang Bin Sheng.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th] At the Supervisory Yuan's general meeting on the 28th, when exercising the right of consent for the candidates for the vacancies of Grand Justices and Examination Committee members, the female supervisors expressed deep dissatisfaction that Qian Jianqiu (female), who had been agreed to be nominated in the original list of Grand Justices, was not included, resulting in no women in the entire list. Cui Zhenhua, Feng Yunxian, Lai Ying, and others stood up and spoke one after another in the morning and afternoon, strongly arguing that there should be a woman among the Grand Justices and that Qian Jianqiu should be added to the message and exercise the right of consent at the same time. The male supervisors opposed this on the grounds that it was not in accordance with the law, which caused fierce debate. It was not until 5:00 PM that the vote was conducted. Before the vote, the female supervisors made various efforts to persuade the eight Grand Justices nominated by Acting President Li to disagree with one person so that Qian Jianqiu could be nominated again. However, the vote count showed that all eight Grand Justices were approved. The efforts of the female supervisors failed again, and they left the meeting in anger before it was adjourned. According to a female supervisor who told reporters: "Yesterday Guo Dejie also told us that there was Qian Jianqiu on the list of Grand Justices. I don't know why Qian was canceled when I saw the message today. We women are always easily bullied, but we will continue to fight. As long as women exist, we women will strive for women's rights to the end."

### Expounding Thoughts on the Atlantic Charter: Zhu Jiahua Issues Statement: Says It Is a Positive and Effective Action to Win Peace

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Mr. Zhu Jiahua recently issued a written statement expounding his thoughts on the Atlantic Charter, stating: Today, world peace is facing serious threats, and the safety and freedom of mankind have been shrouded in fear. This is because everyone in the past has ignored the danger of aggressive factors, allowing them to grow and spread, and even helping them, resulting in the heavy price paid in the Second World War, which only obtained an incomplete truce. Furthermore, after the painful war, everyone was obsessed with optimistic illusions and far-fetched discussions, procrastinating and waiting, and failing to take positive action to prevent the recurrence of war and protect peaceful methods, which led to the decline of the United Nations' prestige and failed to exert its righteous power. In the past four years, after painfully reflecting, everyone has gradually had a clear understanding, and because of potential and external aggressive factors, they have responded to each other, making all countries troubled by the concerns of their hearts and minds. The unprecedented seriousness of the danger is even more deeply felt. China has particularly deep wounds and can understand it even more deeply. The United Nations has repeatedly been unable to prevent acts of aggression due to the abuse of veto power. The Atlantic Charter clearly emphasizes the determination to defend democratic principles and free institutions and agrees on practical methods for collective defense and maintaining peace. It is a positive and effective action to win peace and can also be said to be the awakening of mankind to the current crisis. Therefore, recently there have been the initiation of the Pacific Treaty and the East Asian League. As understanding becomes deeper and more widespread, aggressive factors can be reduced, and mankind can be relieved from another catastrophe. Looking around at the international situation, it is becoming more open and beneficial to our efforts to win genuine peace. We should be encouraged to have courage, strive for reform, and move forward together. There will be a bright future.

### Serious Treatment Issues in Yunnan: Public Education Refuses to Receive Salary; Soldiers and Police Flee

Lu Han Cables for Countermeasures

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 28th] Yunnan Chairman Lu Han recently sent an urgent telegram to Executive Yuan Premier He, Finance Minister Liu, and Sui Jing Director Zhang, requesting urgent countermeasures to stabilize people's hearts because the lives of public education workers in the province have fallen into desperation. The original telegram stated: The lives of civil and military personnel in this province are extremely difficult, and the public is impatient and cannot live a day. There has been a phenomenon of sluggishness. In order to avoid collective petitions, we have been reluctantly trying to raise half-opened silver coins since February, and each person will be given an additional relief fund of five yuan to maintain the current situation. However, the minimum living standard per person in this province requires forty to fifty yuan in half-opened silver coins, which is a drop in the bucket. At present, it is impossible to continue. Security soldiers and police are fleeing one after another, and public education personnel have initiated a refusal to receive salaries. The situation is serious, and the central bank is extremely short of cash and cannot allocate funds. At a time when bandits are rampant and people's hearts are turbulent, if countermeasures are not taken quickly, the future will be difficult to deal with. I am waiting for orders with the utmost urgency.

[Hankou Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 28th] Commander Bai Chongxi returned to Hankou by train from Hunan at 5:30 PM on the 28th. According to Bai's statement to reporters at the station, Director Cheng is highly respected for his governance of Hunan and Jiangxi, and he is extremely determined to strengthen the defense of southern Jiangsu and support central China. The Hunan incident has been resolved reasonably under Director Cheng's enlightened handling.

[Another Dispatch] Bai Chongxi recently issued a letter to the youth on Youth Day, encouraging them in three aspects: (1) Recognize the times and strive for progress, (2) Use reason to distinguish right from wrong, and (3) Promote peace and strive for construction. Finally, Bai pointed out that the Communists are gathering a large army to prepare to cross the Yangtze River, which shows that reasonable and just peace must be paid for with considerable sacrifice. He hopes that everyone will face reality and strive actively.

Special Commentary

### The Road of Youth – A Free China

— Pan Gongzhan

— Written on Youth Day as a Public Memorial to Mr. Dai Jitao —

Mr. Dai Jitao dedicated himself to the revolution, served the country with his writing, and his name will be immortalized. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was always concerned about the peaceful unification of China after the victory. On the 12th of last month, Mr. Dai passed away in Dongyuan, Guangzhou, and he must have regretted not being able to witness a new China of independence, freedom, peace, and unity after the war.

Today is the anniversary of the martyrdom of the Huanghuagang Martyrs, and also our country's Youth Day. Comrades and friends in Beijing and Shanghai, because Mr. Dai loved young people the most during his lifetime, are holding a public memorial for this mentor of youth today.

I have devoted myself to the newspaper industry and am still young. I consider Mr. Dai to be the closest to me among the senior figures in the Party's newspaper industry, in terms of both literary and moral relationships, and friendship between teachers and friends, besides Mr. Ye Chucang and Mr. Chen Bulei. Since the victory, Mr. Chucang passed away first due to overwork, and Mr. Bulei fell into a long sleep last winter. Now, I mourn Mr. Dai, and I truly do not know where my tears should fall. I recall around the tenth year of the Republic of China, when I followed Mr. Bulei at the Shangbao newspaper on Wangping Street. Every midnight, Mr. Dai would always care for us, discussing matters extensively and expressing his opinions frankly, often staying late into the night until I finished my work, and then we would go together to "Sishi Chun" for a midnight snack and continue our discussions. This became a regular occurrence. Thinking about it now, it feels like a different world! Today, on Youth Day, I suppress my sorrow and offer a few words to my beloved young compatriots. I wonder if Mr. Dai's spirit in heaven will approve?

In the winter of the 16th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Dai compiled and published a small booklet titled "The Road of Youth" from the notes he took during lectures to students when he was the president of Zhongshan University, containing over 100,000 words. It explained his observations and experiences regarding national and party affairs at that time. (This book is currently available for sale at the China Cultural Service Society.) This book, along with Mr. Dai's other work, "National Revolution and the Chinese Nationalist Party," were widely circulated and recited by young people. Today, the reason why I want to talk about "The Road of Youth" is still to extend Mr. Dai's posthumous work and offer a few heartfelt words to young friends, targeting the current situation.

In the preface to "The Road of Youth," Mr. Dai said: "Revolution is for survival, not for death; it is to do real work, not to play games. The sin of playing games with revolution is much greater than that of imperialism and warlords. Because all the actions of imperialism can still have some material construction, and when the warlord's territory is consolidated, it can still protect some temporary peace, but only the revolution of playing games has no good results, only disregard for human life and blockage of vitality... Turning back is the shore, striving to uphold, and truly using scientific knowledge and experience to build a country and society of the Three Principles of the People that is consistent in word and deed, then China can avoid the catastrophe of killing and create unlimited vitality." He also painfully blamed himself and encouraged those who bear leadership responsibilities in politics, saying: "Seeing the suffering of the Chinese people today, reflecting on past words and deeds, one cannot help but feel apprehensive!" "If you step into political work, you must put away all greed and hatred, and always take the interests of the people and the country as your own, only then can you save others and yourself."

Today, reading these few posthumous words of Mr. Dai, even if we have not savored the full text of his posthumous work, we cannot help but feel deeply moved. The suffering of the Chinese people today is ten or a hundred times greater than in the 16th year of the Republic of China! The political workers today, relying on their greed and hatred, playing games with revolution, and wreaking havoc on the people's lives, are also ten or a hundred times worse than in the 16th year of the Republic of China! Mr. Dai, as a revolutionary elder, was so compassionate and exhorted the youth. We, as workers who died later, should use a fair and upright mind to guide the youth on the broad road, and never let them go astray. As it seems today, this broad road should undoubtedly still be a broad road of "Free China" paved with the bricks of the Three Principles of the People.

When everyone is clamoring for peace, and peace is becoming the most fashionable term, why do I insist on shouting the broad road of "Free China" to the youth? The reason is very simple. Because the reason why we want peace is to survive, to live; and if our lives lose freedom once we survive, then we become slaves and livestock, no different from death! Therefore, the saying "Give me liberty, or give me death!" has long become a famous saying of Western philosophers. Perhaps some people think that the people today are barely able to save their lives, and only seek temporary peace and security. They are satisfied with this, and they cannot care about whether they have freedom or not. Didn't you see that some liberals, people who used to hang the banner of democracy and freedom on their lips, are now in the Communist areas where newspapers are sealed and newspapers are suspended, and they never talk about freedom anymore? Assuming this is the correct saying, then when the Japanese warlords invaded China twelve years ago, we would not have to insist on resisting for eight years. Under the rule of the Japanese, the Chinese people could still survive! Moreover, the Four Freedoms advocated by President Roosevelt in those years (freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want), were able to become the backbone of the Atlantic Charter, and were able to become the common goal of all democratic countries in the Second World War, and were able to call on all peace-loving and democratic people in the world to unite and overthrow the fascist groups of Germany, Italy, and Japan, precisely because freedom is necessary for life. Therefore, when China talks about peace today, all conditions can be considered and discussed, but the reasonable freedom of life of the people of the whole country must never be lightly sacrificed under the smoke of peace by anyone! Whoever sells the freedom of the people in a way that no one knows, in exchange for false peace, this peace must be unbearable for the youth. Therefore, the youth of China today should make up their minds to strive for the construction of a "Free China" forever, and never stop until the goal is achieved.

Assuming that the peace talks that began in Beiping on April 1, both sides of the representatives can truly, as Mr. Dai said, painfully blame themselves, "put away all greed and hatred, and always take the interests of the people and the country as their own," then they will naturally think about how to maintain the freedom rights that the people should enjoy. Otherwise, if the people taste the poison of losing freedom in the sugar coating of peace, they will definitely rise up to fight for their freedom sooner or later; if that is the case, this peace is only an intermission in the war.

Young compatriots, look at the current situation of the entire globe, you are facing a division of two worlds:—one is the democratic and free world, and the other is the totalitarian and autocratic world. The Chinese people undoubtedly love democracy and freedom, and hate totalitarianism and autocracy. Therefore, no matter how bright or successful the future of China's peace talks is, the youth must strive for "Free China," which should be a clearly defined road. Because, I firmly believe that no youth is willing to be a slave under a totalitarian and autocratic political system.

I remember two years ago, on March 12, 1947, President Truman roared like a lion at a joint session of the US Congress, requesting to lend to Greece and Turkey to support free nations. He said: "Almost all nations must choose between two ways of life. I believe it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures." He more firmly stated: "The destruction of free institutions, the loss of independence, is dangerous not only to them (referring to Greece and Turkey), but also to the whole world... Free peoples throughout the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedoms. If we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world – and we shall surely endanger the welfare of our own nation." This famous speech is the essence of the "Truman Doctrine" that is known all over the world. In a nutshell, the American people and government, rich in the traditional spirit of freedom, are the supporters of all free nations and autonomous countries today. The recent signing of the Atlantic Treaty and the proposal of the US reporter's 1.6 billion loan to aid free countries are the clarion calls for the unity of the free world. Since the Chinese people pushed away the Qing Dynasty, they have endured all the pain and sacrifice for more than thirty years, just to create and maintain a "Free China," to stand among the free nations. Therefore, in today's turbulent world trend, the Chinese youth who love the country and love mankind must do their best to move towards the broad road of "Free China," and not allow themselves to hesitate on a wrong path.

Striving for freedom should not only be the responsibility of members of the Kuomintang, but also the common responsibility of the people of the whole country. Therefore, today our young compatriots, whether they are members of the Kuomintang, members of the Youth Party, members of the Democratic Socialist Party, or even members of the Communist Party, or have no party affiliation, should reflect on the past, deeply repent, wash their hearts and minds, and work together to strive for "Free China." As long as anyone is unwilling to be a slave, they should unite and strive for freedom. Honestly speaking, thinking carefully today, in these two or three decades, the various parties only know how to attack and criticize each other, and put the commonly recognized Three Principles of the People behind their minds, and have brought the country to such a mess and chaos. Who is right and who is wrong cannot be determined in one sentence. But in general, it can be said that this is caused by the combination of causes and conditions. In the past, this cause was planted, and now this effect is obtained. The Communist Party does not need to laugh because of victory today, and the Kuomintang does not need to hate because of defeat today. It must be known that poisoning the people has created evil karma. The disputes, separations, joys, and sorrows in these two or three decades, which are unpredictable, will never be that one party is all right and the other party is all wrong, nor will it be that one person is all right and the other person is all wrong. Today, if you want to judge the details, and decide on one party is all right or one party is all wrong in the peace talks, it is impossible in principle and in reality. What we hope is that everyone does not need to gloss over their faults, but quickly starts from scratch and gives the youth of the whole country a new hope for "Free China," so that they can move forward peacefully on the broad road of "Free China."

If the representatives of both sides of the peace talks do not understand the fundamental meaning of the above, and only seek the realization of the beautiful term "peace," while ignoring the obstacles to the future of "Free China," and do not clear the way for it, or even lead the Chinese people by the nose to the camp of totalitarianism and autocracy, then the youth of China will one day use their own strength to regain the basic human rights of freedom. At that time, wouldn't peace be lost again? Therefore, peace must be built on the foundation of freedom to be stable. Let us shout "Freedom!" "Chinese freedom!" on Youth Day to comfort Mr. Dai's spirit in heaven! (38, 3, 29, in Shanghai).

[Wujin Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 28th] The local Communists have been active in the area southwest of Benniu, more than ten li from Wujin and Danyang.

### Financial Chaos in Various Parts of Fujian; Gold Yuan Coupons Sometimes Refused

Pacification Office and Provincial Government Issue Proclamations Strictly Prohibiting It

[Fuzhou Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 28th] Amid rising prices, the value of gold yuan coupons is depreciating sharply, and the financial situation in various parts of Fujian is becoming more chaotic. Transactions in the market in northern Fujian are all based on gold, silver dollars are prevalent in western Fujian, and foreign currencies are rampant in southern Fujian. Gold yuan coupons are sometimes refused. The Rong Pacification Office and the Fujian Provincial Government issued a proclamation on the 28th stating that gold yuan coupons are the current legal tender of our country and should be circulated and used in accordance with regulations. However, it has been reported that there have often been cases of refusing to use gold yuan coupons in various parts of the province, which has stimulated prices and disrupted finance. This is not the case. In addition to sending telegrams to various commissioner's offices and county and municipal governments to strictly prohibit it, all sectors of society are urged to use it as usual. If there is any refusal to accept, it will be severely punished upon verification. This proclamation is hereby issued for general knowledge.

### Director of the ECA Tianjin Office, Ovei, Told Reporters Yesterday: Restoring North China's Economy Requires Opening Tianjin; Communist Suspicion Heavy, Leading to No Achievement

[News from Our Newspaper] Ovei, Director of the ECA Tianjin Office, stayed in the Communist area for two and a half months after the Communist army captured Tianjin. Mr. Ovei arrived in Shanghai last Saturday via Japan with his staff member Moore Tao. He told reporters on the 28th: Only by opening the port of Tianjin can the economy of North China be restored. The Communists may be interested in reviving the commerce of the area, but because they are too suspicious of outsiders, they cannot accept the advice of experienced people, so there has been no achievement. The value of the People's Bank notes is also falling. The initial exchange rate between the US dollar and the People's Bank notes was set at one to eighty, but three weeks later, in February, it was revised to one to 320 yuan, and the current black market exchange rate is one to 650 yuan. The unemployment problem in Tianjin is very serious, and many factories are struggling. However, because the official regulations stipulate that workers who are dismissed must be paid six months' severance pay, they want to close the factory but cannot. After the Communists took over Tianjin, workers' wages increased, but because of inflation and the falling value of the currency, actual wages decreased; wages are also calculated based on the cost of living index, with millet as the standard. In terms of industry, Tianjin's textile factories have all started operating. The attached cotton fields have accumulated two years of harvest. In the past, due to the war, the city and countryside were separated and could not be used. Now, raw cotton is being shipped into Tianjin, which can be used for six to eight months. Among the seven factories of the Spinning and Construction Company in Tianjin, the one with the newest equipment was unfortunately destroyed by the war, but the remaining six factories and four private factories have all resumed operations, and the Communists have not taken over the private factories.

In addition, Ovei also gave a detailed report on the ECA's 5,000 tons of flour and US$7 million worth of cotton cloth in Tianjin being forcibly taken over by the Communist authorities. The content is no different from what has been published in the newspapers. He also said that although he protested many times, he has not been able to get the Communists to change their decision.

[Another Dispatch] After spending the weekend here, US Ambassador Stuart Redman returned to Beijing by plane yesterday morning. During his stay in Shanghai, the ambassador met with Ovei and Moore, representatives of the US ECA who had recently withdrawn from Tianjin to Shanghai.

### Yongshui City in Western Hunan Captured by Miao Bandits

[Changsha Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 28th] Qianyang was lost, and the bandits set fire to the city. The streets outside the east, south, and north gates of the city were all reduced to ashes.

Chen Yuxin, commissioner of the tenth district, said that he would coexist with Hongjiang (Note: Hongjiang is one of the major towns in western Hunan, and its commercial scale is comparable to that of Changde, Xiangtan, and Hengyang). The Miao bandit leader who attacked Yongshui was Wu Hengliang, with nearly a thousand people. After the defending team guarded the city for eight days and nights, they ran out of ammunition and supplies, and the city finally fell. Dai Jitao, a provincial committee member who was ordered to go to Yuan to guide, recently signed a petition to Chairman Cheng to resign from the provincial committee.

### Guizhou Medical Students Petition to Sell Goods for Charity to Help Teachers

[Guiyang Dispatch from Our Newspaper, 28th] The Gui University students had just returned to school yesterday.

Chairman Gu received them and agreed to issue another month's worth of subsidized rice to teachers and staff, as in the case of Gui University, and asked the Provincial Government to certify the actual price of the rice purchased by public-funded students and send a telegram to the Ministry of Education to issue it truthfully.

In addition, the joint association of professors from Gui University, Gui Medical College, and Gui Teachers College decided on the 27th that the colleges and universities would painfully maintain classes for two more weeks and send a telegram to the Ministry of Education to seek relief quickly, otherwise they would go on strike for a long time.

### Atlantic Pact to be Signed Early Next Month; US Senate Decides to Postpone Discussion; Approval Possibly Delayed Until Summer This Year; Foreign Ministers of Various Western European Countries Arrive in US One After Another

[Our newspaper's report] Washington, 28th Broadcast: Senate Democratic leader Lucas stated in a White House meeting with Secretary of State Acheson that the North Atlantic Pact has been placed at the end of the Senate's agenda today, and hinted that the pact may be delayed until summer this year for approval. Lucas said that numerous unresolved domestic bills will be discussed first. Lucas was one of the congressmen who attended Truman's weekly meeting on Monday. Lucas said Acheson attended the meeting to discuss the legislative procedures after the signing of the Atlantic Pact.

[Our newspaper's report] New York, 28th Broadcast: Italian Foreign Minister Sforza flew from Europe to New York this morning to prepare for the signing of the North Atlantic Pact. According to airline staff, Sforza will travel to Washington on the evening of the 28th.

[Reuters, Washington, 28th] The first group of foreign ministers from the Atlantic Pact countries are expected to arrive here tomorrow. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Schuman are both expected to arrive here on Wednesday. A British Embassy spokesman said that Bevin has already arranged a meeting with US Secretary of State Acheson on Friday to discuss the situation in Greece, Turkey, and the Mediterranean. Local officials are awaiting Portugal's official response to be one of the founding countries of the Atlantic Pact. Security authorities in Washington are currently busy deploying to protect the visiting dignitaries. Officials revealed that the Atlantic Pact will be held in the State Department building. Allowed to attend will be only the plenipotentiaries of each signatory country, as well as their staff and journalists. President Truman will attend as a guest. The ceremony will not last more than an hour. As the foreign ministers of the Atlantic Pact countries arrive in Washington to prepare for the signing, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko will also arrive in New York at the same time to attend the UN General Assembly. Although the Atlantic Pact is not on the agenda of the UN General Assembly, it is expected that the Soviet delegation will try to initiate a debate on the pact and its political consequences in the General Assembly. If this happens, the current General Assembly will inevitably deepen the rift between the East and West blocs to an irreparable point. Some even predict that the Soviet and Eastern European representatives may walk out of the United Nations organization. The current General Assembly is a continuation of the meeting of the Third General Assembly held in Paris last September. At that time, there was an unresolved legal proposal requesting to find ways to promote international cooperation in the political field. The Soviet Union may raise the issue of the Atlantic Pact during the debate on the case, pointing out that the Western European Union and the Atlantic Pact run counter to efforts to encourage international cooperation.

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] The foreign ministers of ten or even twelve Western countries will gather here in the coming days to sign the Atlantic Pact and usher in a new era of Western solidarity to counter the Soviet Union. The foreign ministers will try to reach agreements on four major international issues: (1) the issue of the former Italian territories, with the focus on whether Italy will obtain trusteeship from the United Nations or adopt other forms of management; (2) the unity and development of West Germany, which is the main topic of discussion between the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France; (3) the issue of joint defense outside the Atlantic region, especially the Near East and the Mediterranean; British Foreign Secretary Bevin has already discussed this issue with the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey. It is heard that Bevin also supports the establishment of an anti-communist organization in Southeast Asia; (4) the establishment of a joint defense organization under the North Atlantic Pact, which will only be discussed in general, and the details will be determined after the treaty is implemented.

### New York Peace Congress Closes; Resolves to Demand Strengthening of the United Nations and Cultural Freedom; Unanimously Calls for Seeking International Understanding

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 27th] At the closing meeting of the World Peace Congress held at Madison Square Garden in New York, representatives from various countries participating in the congress unanimously called on the broad masses of the world to rise up and defend world peace, seek international understanding, and denounce the policies adopted by the US State Department.

At the same time, speeches were delivered by crowds of approximately 20,000 people, estimated by American and foreign representatives.

At the same time, a proposal to send a delegation to attend the Paris Intellectual Peace Congress was handed over to the Executive Committee. During the congress, Soviet chief representative Fadeyev harshly criticized the speech given by Professor Schuman of political science at Williams College. Schuman said: The United States and the Soviet Union should both bear the responsibility for any trend towards war. Fadeyev bluntly declared: "Professor Schuman is indeed mistaken. No one in our country wants to launch a war against the United States or any country."

### Bathing Industry Price Basis Problem; Representatives Express Difficulties; Social Bureau Promises to Find a Solution

[Our newspaper's report] After the problem of the haircut price basis was resolved, the bathing industry, due to more complicated circumstances, has not yet resolved the basis problem. Yesterday afternoon, the Social Bureau convened representatives of the industry's guild, including executive directors Shu Taigang and Yang Yilong. According to Shu et al.: The industry has a total of 128 businesses, divided into three grades of special class, three grades of A class, and three grades of B class, for a total of three classes and nine grades. The opinions of the bathhouses of various members are extremely inconsistent, and most of them oppose calculating based on the cost of living index. The difficulty for the industry is that the price of fuel has risen too high. The bran and straw used now are calculated in rice, and the market price differs in the morning and evening, and the Social Bureau does not allocate fuel. Other items such as towels, tea, soap, water and electricity are also consumed in large quantities. Commodity prices rise almost every day. The industry is currently adjusting prices at any time based on the prices of fuel and other items, with each increase being about 30-40%. After the board of directors has decided, it notifies the member bathhouses to implement it. If the price is adjusted according to the cost of living index twice a month, the cost of living index will inevitably jump one fold after it is published, and business will be greatly affected. On the eve of the publication of the cost of living index, it will inevitably be overwhelmed again. They do not want to see this phenomenon and hope for a slow increase. Section Chief Xi instructed after they expressed their difficulties: The industry still needs to quickly draft a basis based on pre-war prices for review. If there are any difficulties, the Social Bureau will assist as much as possible, and technical problems can be solved. Shu et al. will convene a joint meeting of the industry's board of directors and supervisors within the next few days to make a decision.

### University President Conference: Minister of Education Attends and Delivers Speech, Announces Open-minded Approach

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Municipal Association of Universities and Colleges held its 23rd meeting yesterday afternoon at the Tsinghua Alumni Association, with more than 30 presidents of public and private universities and colleges in attendance. The newly appointed Minister of Education, Hang Liwu, was invited to attend and deliver a speech, which roughly stated: "Because of his firm refusal being unsuccessful, he reluctantly took office. During this difficult time, if one wants to talk about rectifying education, one can only do what is within one's capabilities and cannot expect too much. Currently, issues such as increasing education funding, improving the treatment of faculty and staff, improving students' lives, and resettling refugee students are all urgently awaiting resolution, especially the issue of funding. In the future, the Ministry of Education hopes to have a new democratic and free approach in its administration, trusting the presidents of each school, adopting a tiered responsibility system, and not waiting for the Ministry of Education to resolve everything, so as not to delay efficiency due to the back-and-forth of official documents. Education belongs to everyone and is a whole. Although there are many difficulties at present, since I have accepted the position, I am determined to do my best and bravely face them. I hope that the presidents of each school can understand and provide more help and cooperation." At this point, Minister Hang stated that he still had many things to report, but because there were outsiders (referring to reporters) present, he did not want to say more.

Zhang Yi, the president of Fudan University, praised Minister Hang's statement that he fully trusted the administrative authorities of each school, calling it an enlightened approach. Wang Yuxiang, the vice president of Daxia University, believed that education is a whole, and that in the past, private schools were like illegitimate children. He hoped that the Ministry of Education would take care of both public and private schools in the future. Sheng Zhenwei, the dean of the Soochow University Law School, pointed out that the Ministry of Education's review of the qualifications of university graduates had been delayed for more than a year or two and diplomas had not yet been issued. He hoped that this could be improved in the future.

They also made three demands to Minister Hang in person: (1) Starting in February, the salaries of faculty and staff should be calculated according to the current month's price index without any deductions. (2) The 500-fold increase issued at the beginning of this month should be used as part of the salary supplement for February and should not be deducted from the salary in March. (3) Please increase academic research funding again. Minister Hang replied that the first two points would be considered after returning to Beijing. The third point, academic research funding, could be increased, but the amount was yet to be determined.

### Coal Shortage on Both Railways Resolved; National Bank Agrees to Advance Coal Funds: 7,000 Tons Every Ten Days

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau has been severely affected by the government's military and public transportation and the sluggish business in recent months, and its financial situation is extremely tight. Moreover, due to the separation of the north and south, the source of coal has been drastically reduced, and coal prices have soared. The Railway Bureau's turnover is not flexible, and it is unable to purchase coal, which has caused a serious coal shortage on both railways. Wang Zhaohuai, the director of the bureau, has repeatedly gone to Beijing to request relief from the Ministry of Communications. It was heard yesterday that the Central Bank authorities have agreed to provide long-term loans for coal funds for both railways. The National Bank will advance 7,000 tons of coal funds every ten days, and then the Railway Bureau will gradually repay the funds. The coal shortage on both railways can be said to be completely resolved.

### Lack of Cash Affects Salary Payments; Social Bureau Director Makes Two Recommendations to National Bank

According to Cao Peizi, the director of the Social Bureau, who met with reporters yesterday: The next issue of the Shanghai Municipal Workers' Cost of Living Index for this month will be published soon, but the shortage of cash in the city has not improved. After the previous issue of the Cost of Living Index was published this month, some factories issued wages in the form of bank drafts, which workers could not use, resulting in disputes. In view of the above situation, Cao made a special trip to the Central Bank yesterday morning to meet with Director Lin Chongyong to discuss the issue of cash for factories to pay wages. Cao said that there are about 500,000 workers in the city. Assuming an average monthly salary of 25 yuan per person for half a month, and the Cost of Living Index is 3,000 times, then 45 billion yuan is needed. If workers are paid with bank drafts, the impact would be enormous. Cao also explained the seriousness of the issue and suggested that the Central Bank should indicate on the checks when factories pay wages to facilitate endorsement, and relax the withdrawal limit or issue silver dollars so that workers' lives are not affected by the lack of cash for salary payments. According to Cao, Director Lin has paid attention to this issue.

### Tianyaoqiao Theft Case; Two Perpetrators Arrested Based on Tire Tracks

[Our Newspaper's Report] At 9 p.m. on the 20th, 720 kilograms of cotton, two dan of rice, swimming money, a gold ring, and a suit of clothes, worth a total of more than two million gold yuan, were stolen from Gong Chunquan's home at 87 Zhaoxiang, Tianyaoqiao, Huxi.

### Judgement on the Case of Ji Juemi Being Sued for Selling Empty Land in Hardoon Garden: Sales Contract Confirmed Valid; Criminal Part Declared Not Guilty

[Our Newspaper's Report] The dispute caused by Ji Juemi, the chief accountant of Hardoon, selling empty land in Hardoon Garden but delaying the handover, and the buyer Huang Zizhao filing a private prosecution with the District Court's Criminal Division, accusing Ji of fraud, with an accompanying civil lawsuit. After several trials by the two divisions, the criminal division, Judge Huang Guangyu, and Judge Ling Yuanqing of the civil division announced their verdicts yesterday:

Criminal Part: Ruling: Ji Juemi is not guilty. The reasoning roughly stated: Whether the defendant is guilty of a crime should be determined by whether he had the intent to illegally possess the property and used fraud to induce others to hand over the property. The contract signed by both parties in the real estate transaction, with all the brokers' guarantees, has been confirmed by Fan Yunzhan, Ji's representative, in court that Ji indeed wanted to sell the property and had no intention of fraud. Even the last part of item 4 of the original contract states: "If the seller regrets and does not perform the sales act, the seller shall return double the deposit to the buyer, terminate the contract, and compensate for all losses." Even if one party is unwilling to sign the contract and hand over the property due to reasons (Ji delayed the contract due to the depreciation of the gold yuan), it can be considered attributable to the defendant and is a civil matter, which is completely different from the criminal situation of fraud. Moreover, in the last paragraph of the reply letter sent by the defendant to the plaintiff on November 6 last year, "You can go to Fan Yunzhan to retrieve the deposit" indicates that there was no intentional fraud, so the defendant was declared not guilty in accordance with the law.

Civil Part: Ruling: (1) The contract signed by the defendant's agents Fan Yunzhan, Tan Boya, and Zhang Haitong, on behalf of the defendant, and the plaintiff on September 15, 1948, for the sale of the empty land in Hardoon Garden on Zhongzheng Middle Road, Shanghai, i.e., part of No. 2437 of the former Public Works Department, Land Register No. 12170, British Register, approximately 5 mu, 4 fen, 6 li, and 7 hao, is valid. (2) The defendant shall, in his own name, sign a sales contract with the plaintiff for the aforementioned land, submit it to the Shanghai Municipal Land Administration Bureau, transfer it to the plaintiff's name, and hand over the aforementioned land to the plaintiff for management. After the plaintiff provides a security deposit of 1 million gold yuan, the (2nd) ruling is approved for provisional execution. The plaintiff's other claims and applications for provisional execution are rejected, and the litigation costs are borne by the defendant.

### Lawyers' Opinions

According to the lawyers, since the civil part of the case has ruled that the sales contract signed by both parties is valid, it is not yet known whether the defendant Ji Juemi will appeal. According to lawyers, the contract price is 480,000 gold yuan. In addition to the 50,000 yuan deposit that the buyer has already paid, 430,000 yuan remains to be paid. Due to the depreciation of the currency, this amount in September of last year is vastly different from the current value in terms of actual income. Ji Juemi, who originally insisted on pricing in gold bars, will inevitably find it difficult to accept. Therefore, when the two parties perform the handover in accordance with the judgment in the future, disputes caused by the currency value change may still be unavoidable in order to seek a solution.

### Under Mrs. Sun Yat-sen's Auspices: The San Mao Paradise Movement - Countless Suffering Children Across the City Await Compassionate Assistance from All Sectors

[Special Report] The "San Mao Paradise Movement" is still a nascent concept today, but I predict that it will soon become a household name. This is because San Mao, from the hand of artist Zhang Leping, is a realistic figure, a lively presence scattered throughout the dark corners of Shanghai, and even all of China.

The child welfare work led by Mrs. Sun Yat-sen takes San Mao as its target for charitable work for children. Currently, there are three child welfare stations established in impoverished areas such as Jiaozhou Road. Over 23,000 displaced children benefit from this, including newspaper sellers, garbage collectors, bridge attendants, and begging children.

Easy to Understand for All Ages and Practical

Child welfare work is divided into two aspects: education and healthcare. In education, there are currently 100 literacy classes, 30 of which are run by welfare stations, and 70 are family literacy classes. The establishment of family literacy classes relies entirely on the successful experimentation of the "little teacher" system. Child welfare stations promote literacy education based on Tao Xingzhi's educational principle of "learn and teach immediately," fostering a spirit of self-help and mutual assistance. As a result, literacy classes of all sizes have been organized in small rooms, attics, and kitchens. Those who serve as teachers are former illiterates from two years ago who, after two years of diligent study at the welfare station, have become teachers. Originally, the "learn and teach immediately" little teacher system had no time limit, but now the child welfare station, in order to ensure mature training, has temporarily set it as a two-year system. The first year is purely literacy education, and the second year is life education. The teaching materials are self-compiled, vivid, practical, and easy to understand. They call it "Easy to Understand for All Ages." In the past two years, more than 200 little teachers have been trained. These little teachers all have exceptionally tragic backgrounds, but their desire for knowledge is extremely strong.

Medical Care and Nutrition: Two Important Tasks

In healthcare, there are two aspects: medical care and nutrition. Each child welfare station has a clinic that provides free medical treatment and medicine to poor children. Every day, more than 200 children are saved. For the sake of universal coverage, there is also a mobile medical team that travels around the slum areas to serve the poor. In terms of nutrition, more than a thousand suffering infants are regularly nourished with milk powder, cod liver oil, and vitamins, all of which come from the Economic Cooperation Administration and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. All beneficiary infants are rigorously investigated by the welfare station, and they cherish resources, never wasting a single bit unless the child truly needs it.

Starting with Eighty San Maos

Mrs. Sun Yat-sen's child welfare work has been underway for less than three years, but through the efforts of just over two years, the results have been significant and the achievements remarkable.

At the beginning, only about 80 San Maos benefited, but now it has expanded to over 20,000 San Maos. However, Mrs. Sun Yat-sen is by no means satisfied with this, as there are too many San Maos in China. And the difficulties follow, because as welfare work expands, the need for funding becomes even more urgent. Taking Shanghai as an example, there are countless homeless children who are waiting for rescue. In order to promote welfare work, it is necessary to mobilize more manpower and resources. It is for this reason that the San Mao Paradise Movement has been announced. Mrs. Sun Yat-sen is determined to build a paradise for San Mao, hoping that one day every San Mao can enter paradise. But this requires the efforts of the public. The child welfare organization is currently preparing to recruit members, seeking members who are willing to help San Mao. According to their estimates, it costs three silver dollars per month to help one San Mao. Anyone who can sponsor one San Mao is an ordinary member, and anyone who can sponsor five or more San Maos is an honorary member. Their goal is to recruit 500 ordinary members before the end of April, which means that 500 San Maos can be saved as a result.

Pitiful Lives of Vagrants

In order to make more people aware of San Mao's impoverished and destitute life, the child welfare station has scheduled a San Mao art exhibition at the Great World Department Store on Children's Day, April 4th. There are more than 300 pictures of San Mao's wandering life on display. I hope you can take the time to visit it once, you will definitely find San Mao lovable. So let us use everyone's strength to build San Mao Paradise!

### Ding ZhiPan Angrily Executes Wan A Da

— Special Correspondent Yang WenYu

In the western district of Xuzhou, mentioning Wan A Da, the detective chief of the criminal police team, is quite well-known. His real name is Wan Bin, which is unfamiliar to people. The abnormal social situation has turned him from a coachman into the owner of the Tailai Hotel, a coach company owner, the leader of numerous followers, and the most capable of the five detective chiefs and more than forty detectives in the criminal police team. Who would have known that this "little celebrity" in Suzhou would have his new and old crimes settled so quickly, and that he would be executed at the platform of Suzhou Railway Station at 1:20 AM on the 25th under the wrath of Chairman Ding? Most people were surprised, and even Wan himself did not realize he had committed a capital crime until just before his execution. It was too late to regret. Whether it is "using severe punishments in chaotic times" or "killing one to warn a hundred," Chairman Ding's decisive handling of Wan A Da this time was truly an merciless operation on evil forces.

Served as a Detective for Fourteen Years

Fourteen years ago, Wan A Da began his career as a detective in the investigation team. During the period of occupation, he even served as the captain. He almost lost his life because of a case. After the victory, he was accused of being a traitor under the name of Wan Yunlong. However, due to the social connections he had in all directions, he was not brought down. Of course, people who emerge from such an environment inevitably have many enemies. However, due to his power, no one dared to offend him. Unexpectedly, over a small matter, when Wan was detained by the police patrol team, letters reporting his crimes flew in like snowflakes, finally ending his life. This fact, which borders on karmic retribution, is truly a lesson that should be taken to heart.

The captain of the criminal police team was recently appointed a month ago by Director Wu, who invited Song Yuanheng and Xian Chengming, who had worked in the Zhabei Police Station in Shanghai for a long time, to take over. The reporter had several conversations with them, and they felt that it was difficult to deal with both people and affairs. The small area of Suzhou, the complexity of the people, and the deteriorating social atmosphere were the most troubling.

Wan Arrested in Western Medicine Case

Some time ago, the criminal police team, led by Wan A Da, uncovered a case of counterfeiting Western medicine in Jiuqu Lane. When the group of criminals were detained in the criminal police team, Captain Song ordered that no relatives were allowed to visit. Unexpectedly, Wan A Da privately allowed Kuai Daquan to visit Zhang Liang, the criminal in the case. It happened to be discovered by Deputy Captain Xian, who also found a lump of opium on Kuai. Captain Song, due to his duty, summoned Wan A Da to the office to investigate the responsibility. Who knew that Wan A Da looked down on this new captain and even retorted, almost drawing his gun to fight. Afterwards, Captain Song reported the incident to Director Wu, saying that Wan was so lawless. Thus, Director Wu ordered the police patrol team to detain Wan at the criminal police team. Wan A Da viewed this risk very normally. He believed that he had a way to escape from the cage.

Accusations of Crimes One After Another

However, this opportunity was seized by Wan's many enemies. Therefore, letters reporting his crimes were sent to the county government and the police station one after another. Among them, one case of corruption involved a flour merchant, Chen Ruisheng, who had an affair with Zhang Wang Zhenying, a woman from Weiting. After a long time, Zhang discovered that she was pregnant and demanded money from Chen to have an abortion. The intermediary in this matter was Wan A Da, who took 30,000 yuan of compensation from the 16 old yuan of gold yuan coupons. Some people also said that Wan played the "honey trap" in the case and reaped the price of dozens of bags of flour. In any case, these rumors had long reached Chairman Ding's ears. Therefore, when Chairman Ding came to Suzhou on the 23rd to attend the joint defense conference of the three counties, he was furious about this. On the 24th, after inspecting the river defense from Changshu, he hosted a banquet for people from all walks of life in the Yusha in Ximei Lane, and said to County Magistrate Zhu: "Have Wan Bin shot tomorrow!" At midnight, Chairman Ding and Deputy Commander of the Security Yang Zongding planned to return to the town by special train. However, for some unknown reason, on a whim, he ordered County Magistrate Zhu, who was seeing him off at the station, to immediately bring Wan Bin to the station for execution. Chairman Ding's lightning-fast decision was probably because he was afraid that the all-powerful Wan Bin might escape after he left Suzhou. County Magistrate Zhu obeyed the order and immediately telegraphed Director Wu of the Police Bureau and Commander Sun of the Security Regiment to send soldiers from the search platoon to escort Wan A Da to the station under strict guard. Wan A Da did not expect that his death sentence had been pronounced by Chairman Ding in the Yusha, and even more unexpectedly, he would be on the execution ground in the middle of the night. Along the way, he appeared calm and chatted and laughed with the escorting soldiers.

Screamed for Help Before Execution

When he arrived at the station, Director Wu asked the Chairman how to deal with him. Chairman Ding looked back at Deputy Commander Yang and said, "Just do it!" Yang then wrote eight large characters on the entire file of Wan's case: "By order of the Chairman, executed by shooting." Subsequently, Deputy Commander Yang interrogated Wan on the dark platform. At this time, Wan A Da saw that the situation was so serious and realized that things were not good. In addition, the night was cold and windy, and he could not help but shiver. At that time, Deputy Commander Yang asked Wan Bin's name and age, and then asked him how long he had been a detective. Wan replied that he had been a detective for more than ten years. Wan thought that his ten years of experience could be used to redeem his life, but Deputy Commander Yang's thoughts may have been the opposite. Therefore, he gave the order: "Take him away." Only Wan Bin's desperate screams were heard: "Officer, save me! Officer, save me!" The screams had not yet ended when the gunshots rang out. Wan A Da was quickly shot three times and died beside the water tower on the platform. Deputy Commander Yang finished the execution and ordered that the body be exposed for three days as a warning. Then he boarded the train and reported to Chairman Ding before the special train slowly drove west.

The "hero" created by the times was also swallowed by the times today. Tens of thousands of people flocked to the station to see Wan A Da's last moments!

### National Bank Begins Issuing Fixed Denomination Promissory Notes - To Relieve Cash Panic in the Market - Initially, a 50,000 Yuan Note Will Be Issued, Limited to Circulation in This City

[Reported by this newspaper] The Silver Money Trust Industry Association of this city, in view of the recent shortage of cash in the market, suggested to the National Bank to issue fixed denomination promissory notes to remedy the situation. It is now learned that the National Bank began to issue the notes yesterday, which are divided into four denominations: 5,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, 50,000 yuan, and 100,000 yuan. Yesterday, the 50,000 yuan note was issued first. This promissory note can be used to replace cash. The phenomenon of cash shortage should be improved as a result.

In addition, according to a confidential official of the National Bank: This promissory note must be countersigned by both the Assistant Manager and the Section Chief of the Operations Bureau before it can be effective. Therefore, due to signature issues, a maximum of 500 to 1,000 notes can be issued per day, which in fact may not be able to completely solve the cash shortage, but can only slightly alleviate the tight cash situation. Therefore, the current issuance is only a transitional measure. In addition, this promissory note is made by the Central Printing Plant with banknote paper, which is about half an inch longer and wider than the current 500 yuan note. There is a wide gray-black border around it, and the middle is a light blue-gray pattern with the six artistic characters "Central Bank Promissory Note" embedded in it. The other side of the promissory note is completely white. Yesterday's issues were all 50,000 yuan denomination promissory notes. However, due to signature issues, they were not actually issued, and the banknotes sent by the Central Printing Plant yesterday were sufficient to be distributed to various banks and businesses.

### Market Sentiment is Volatile, and Gold and Banknotes Rise Steadily

[Reported by this newspaper] In the gold market, due to the fact that the Central Bank did not throw out gold yesterday, and even the emergence of large-denomination promissory notes, market sentiment was volatile. With the Northern Gang, Guangdong Gang, and Bank Gang competing to enter the market, the opening price was 747,000, and the upward trend was there. After a slight drop to 743,000, it soon rose to the daily limit of 748,000. In the afternoon, due to the further contraction of the Hong Kong exchange rate, gold prices in other areas rose one after another. Market sentiment continued to be optimistic, and the opening price reached 780,000. Midway, due to the sudden tightening of credit, the unofficial interest rate rose to eight or nine jiao, and the securities gang sold high, stepping down slightly to 750,000. It finally closed at 753,000, an increase of 73,000 compared to the previous day, with a total interest rate of about one yuan for two days.

The second offer was 730,000 and 800,000. The third offer was 750,000 and 820,000. In the afternoon, the fourth offer rose again to 810,000 and 880,000, jumping another 140,000.

The premium listed by money changers in the morning was 780,000, and in the afternoon it fell again to 750,000 and 770,000.

[Reported by this newspaper] The price of silver dollars on the street was first weak and then firm. In the morning, due to the hope for peace, market sentiment stabilized, and large head silver dollars once fell to 9,000 yuan and 9,600 yuan. Near noon, with the sharp rise in gold and banknotes, various parties rushed to buy, and holders rarely sold. The price rose to 10,000 yuan and 10,050 yuan. The market situation was chaotic in the afternoon, and it once rose to 10,050 yuan and 11,000 yuan. Finally, the asking price was 10,020 yuan and 10,070 yuan. Small head silver dollars were asking 9,400 yuan and 9,800 yuan. Dragon and eagle silver dollars were not in demand due to the lack of people in Tianjin, and the market situation was flat, asking 6,700 yuan and 7,700 yuan, an increase of 500 compared to the previous day. In the money exchange industry, the spot price of large head silver dollars was 11,600 yuan and 11,700 yuan on the same day.

[Reported by this newspaper] The gold industry market yesterday stipulated the following members of the gold purity inspection committee: (1) Yuan Xin (2) Qing Fa Yong (3) Da De Cheng (4) Tai Kang Run (5) Yong Feng (6) Jiu Cheng (7) Yu Xing Yong (8) Xiang He (9) Yu Fa Yong (10) Dong Lai Sheng (11) Hong Xing Yong (12) Yong Xing (13) Hong Feng Yong.

### Second Principal Repayment of Gold Public Bonds - Lottery to Be Held in Shanghai on April 2

The second principal repayment of the first series of short-term gold public bonds of the Republic of China in 1949 is still due at the end of March according to the repayment and interest payment schedule. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has decided to hold a lottery at 74 Dianchi Road, Shanghai, on the fourth floor of the Central Trust Bureau on April 2, following the precedent of the first principal repayment lottery, and has sent letters to the Shanghai Audit Office of the Ministry of Audit, the bond fund management committee, and relevant agencies to send personnel to monitor the execution of the lottery, and welcomes people from all walks of life to visit.

Also, it is reported that the second principal repayment of the bond should start on April 3 after the lottery on April 2, but that day is a holiday, so the repayment procedures will start on the 4th.

### Credit Market Turns from Loose to Stable

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday's credit market was still loose in the morning, but gradually stabilized in the afternoon. Although tightening was seen during the exchange, the daily borrowing rate in the morning was still between 35 yuan and 45 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the large-scale sale of foreign exchange transfer certificates by the National Bank, credit tightened, and the unofficial interest rate rose to 70 yuan to 80 yuan per day. Also, yesterday, banks and bureaus had a total deficit of 5.1 billion, foreign merchant banks had a surplus of 1.3 billion, large exchanges had a surplus of 4.4 billion, and small exchanges had a deficit of 600 million.

### Chinese Stocks are All Red - Still Buying More After the Daily Limit

[Reported by this newspaper] The market situation of Chinese stocks yesterday was extremely sharp, which was an unprecedented grand occasion after the resumption of trading on the exchange. In the early morning, the trend of credit was even more rampant than on Saturday, and the gold price was reported to have stopped after opening. Since the resumption of aftermarket trading yesterday made trading more flexible and reduced the risks for both long and short positions, market sentiment was therefore invigorated. Yongsha opened at 9.54 yuan in the morning and immediately reported a limit increase. Many bulls sold their profits from Saturday, and it fell to 8.73 yuan. Afterwards, various parties absorbed again at low prices, and the market trend reached the daily limit again. Over-the-counter buying was especially strong. After reaching the limit, there was demand for additional bids of 0.3, 0.35, and even 0.45.

Small and medium-sized stocks all reached their daily limits. Among them, Meiya had a particularly strong trend, opening at 2.78 yuan in the morning and reaching the limit. Xinguang was at 0.96 yuan, Jingfu was at 0.4 yuan, Jinglun was at 2.4 yuan, Qinxing was at 0.53 yuan, Huaci was at 2.9 yuan, Yonggong was at 2.28 yuan, Xinhua Department Store was at 2.94 yuan, Commerce was at 2.82 yuan, and Zhabei Water and Electricity was at 1.8 yuan. After the limit, there was still buying for additional bids over-the-counter.

In the afternoon, Yongsha was initially opened at the previous day's limit due to the obstruction of the limit increase transaction in the previous market, and there was demand for additional bids of 0.2 and 0.25. The highest additional bid was 0.5 and 0.55. In the middle, it was heard that the price of gold had fallen and credit felt tight. The unofficial interest rate on securities was made to 0.7 and 0.75. After breaking the limit, it was still reported to be at the limit increase. It was not until 2:45 that the selling trend turned strong and it broke the limit again to 9.2 yuan. Near the close, the securities gang worked hard and reported the limit increase again. Other stocks such as Xinguang rose from 0.94 yuan to the daily limit of 0.96 yuan. The total turnover for the day was 3,192,403,360 shares.

### Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise with No Goods

Due to the rise in gold prices, people were optimistic about gold public bonds. The morning opening was 400,000 for buying, and then there was a transaction at 430,000. The afternoon closing was 500,000, and the asking price was still 500,000 in the afternoon, but there was no transaction.

The over-the-counter prices of foreign stocks rose linearly, with each stock rising by about 50%. Yisha was at 27,000 yuan and 27,500 yuan, British Union was at 30,000 yuan and 33,000 yuan, Asia was at 3,000 yuan and 3,200 yuan, Jardine was bidding at 85,000 for buying, and other stocks were also in demand.

### Silk Price Surge Followed by Market Softening

Yesterday, the silk market surged sharply. After the market opened, speculative trading was rampant, gold prices soared, and cotton yarn prices skyrocketed, boosting market sentiment.

The "120" Bright Silk grade opened at 3,010,000, rose as high as 3,460,000, and closed at noon at 3,900,000 for the forward position. In the afternoon, monetary conditions tightened, gold prices retreated, and the excessive price increases led many long positions to cash in, causing the market to soften. The quoted price for the forward position was 3,800,000.

Raw silk opened in the morning at 4,800,000. Subsequently, rising gold prices and strengthening foreign exchange rates improved market sentiment, leading to aggressive buying and steadily rising prices, nearing 5,050,000 near noon. In the afternoon, the market softened and the intent to sell was strong, with supply available at 5,000,000. Quilted silk fabrics opened at 2,150,000, rose to 2,250,000 at one point, then experienced profit-taking and increased selling pressure, causing the market to decline to 2,110,000. At noon, buying interest surged again, leading to a rebound and a close at 2,270,000. Market sentiment softened significantly in the afternoon, and with tightening monetary conditions, selling was quoted at 2,200,000.

### Rayon Price List

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the China Trust Bureau's Rayon Meeting resolved the rayon price list for the 14th period of this year (March 28 to April 2). The prices are: Italian 120 Third Grade Bright Rayon at 2,950,000 yuan per case. 120 Dull Rayon at 3,215,500 yuan per case. 150 Third Grade Bright Rayon at 2,773,000 yuan per case.

### Cotton Yarn Prices Soar; Fabric Buying Spree Begins

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions, with favorable monetary conditions and external factors, boosted buying sentiment. People rushed to purchase, and local businesses eagerly sought fine yarn. Businesses from Guangdong also showed interest. Cotton yarn prices soared sharply, with an average increase of about 30%.

42-count Blue Phoenix yarn dropped from 5,400,000 to a low of 5,300,000, then rebounded to 5,780,000 at noon, a staggering increase of 1,250,000 compared to the Wealth Weekend closing price. 32-count Silver Moon yarn neared the 4,000,000 mark, closing at 3,900,000, a sharp increase of 780,000.

21-count Double Horse spot goods opened in the morning at 2,830,000, briefly dipped to 2,800,000, and then broke through the 3,000,000 mark to reach a peak of 3,050,000 at the close, a surge of 615,000 yuan. Factory orders closed at 3,000,000 at noon. 20-count Double Horse surged by 600,000 yuan, closing at 2,870,000. Jin Cheng and Tian Nu yarns also traded around 2,800,000 yuan. All grades of 16-count and below reached unprecedented highs. The market is closed today for the holiday.

The fabric market soared, mainly due to increasingly abundant monetary conditions. Many in the industry held long positions, and there were few takers for overnight loans. Additionally, reports from outside the industry indicated rising prices, prompting widespread buying. Sellers were reluctant to sell, and fabric prices reached new highs.

Dragon Head Fine Cloth opened at 96,000 yuan, briefly dipping to 95,000 yuan. Near noon, rumors of soaring cotton yarn prices prompted aggressive buying from industry players, causing prices to steadily increase and break through the 100,000 mark, reaching a new peak of 112,000 yuan, a sharp increase of 24,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Wu Fu and La Ba Tong Fine Cloth both closed at 92,500 yuan, an increase of 11,000 yuan.

Si Jun Zi Serge rose from 92,000 yuan to a high of 97,500 yuan, closing at 97,200 yuan at noon, a final increase of 14,200 yuan. Si Jun Zi Yuan Zhi Tribute Cloth held steady at 100,000 yuan. The high-end 190 grade of Shi Lin brand opened at 220,000 yuan. Today is National Renaissance Day, and the fabric market is closed for the holiday. Trading will resume as usual tomorrow.

### Sale of Yarn and Cloth

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, the Central Bank continued to entrust the Textile Construction Company to sell yarn, conducting two rounds of sales. A total of 386 lots were sold to 215 eligible buyers, with a total value of 1,029,480,000 yuan.

The sale process was as follows: (1) 115 lots of 20-count Red Bee yarn were offered at 2,480,000 yuan, with 6 applicants for 25 lots, which were allocated accordingly. (2) 361 lots of 20-count Li Ma Sunlight yarn were offered at 2,680,000 yuan, with 209 applicants for 1,066 lots, and 361 lots were allocated to 209 eligible buyers.

Additionally, the company sold 94 lots of yarn yesterday as usual to 42 eligible buyers, with a total value of 464,550,000 yuan. The prices for each count of yarn were: 6-count Secondary Sunlight at 950,000 yuan, 15-count Feng Nian at 2,400,000 yuan, 21-count Xian Tao Second Grade at 2,850,000 yuan, 32-count Sunlight at 3,850,000 yuan, 40-count Red Bao Guang at 5,250,000 yuan, and 42-count Double Strand Li Ma at 5,700,000 yuan.

### Coal Prices Adjusted Again

[Our Newspaper] The Four Mines Joint Management Office adjusted coal prices again yesterday. The new prices are as follows for delivery in Pudong: Chang Cheng White Coal Lump at 250,000 yuan per ton, White Coal Small at 200,000 yuan, Jilong Bituminous Coal at 150,500 yuan, Kailuan Bituminous Coal at 182,620 yuan, and Foreign Bituminous Coal at 381,240 yuan.

### Diesel Shipped to Shanghai

[Our Newspaper] The tanker "Dank Mershm" (transliteration), managed by the Mei Bang Company, carrying 3,800 tons of diesel from Persia, is expected to arrive today and berth at the China Petroleum Company pier in Laoshusha for unloading. The vessel also carries 10,500 tons of diesel destined for Kaohsiung.

### Tung Oil Rises

Although the tung oil market experienced weak sales yesterday due to limited actual demand, the unprecedented abundance of monetary conditions in the industry and the sudden sharp increases in the prices of other commodities, especially the surge in foreign exchange settlement certificates, boosted market sentiment. Sellers continued to raise prices, climbing more than 10,000 yuan compared to last week. The underlying support remained solid, suggesting a continued upward trend.

### Chamber of Commerce Continues to Wire Government Ministries, Urging Removal of Restrictions on Southward Transport of Yarn and Cloth

[Our Newspaper] Since the Ministry of Industry and Commerce imposed restrictions on the southward transport of yarn and cloth, the resulting stagnant sales of cotton cloth have directly threatened the suspension of production in the textile and dyeing industries, a matter of great concern. Yesterday, the City Chamber of Commerce again telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, urging them to immediately abolish the quota system for southward transport.

### Tea Market Active

Yesterday, the tea market opened strongly in the south, reaching new price peaks. This was attributed to widespread rumors that tea-producing regions such as Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui were planning to value this year's unreleased new tea in terms of white rice, with most requiring eight or more "shi" (unit of volume) of white rice to exchange for one hundred "jin" (unit of weight) of new tea. This greatly boosted market sentiment. Furthermore, rising gold and US dollar prices led to increases in the prices of various commodities, and tea merchants followed suit, with sellers quoting prices at will, leading to further rapid price increases.

Although there were attempts to raise the price of this year's Wenzhou Xin Longjing tea, they ultimately lacked the strength to push higher, as the source prices remained unchanged. It was reported that industry players were still discounting prices at 8,000 yuan per "jin." However, the underlying support remained firm. It was observed that trading activity today was limited, with buyers wary of high prices and few wholesale transactions.

### Market Stroll

— By a Spectator

Rising Winds Expand Rapidly; Promissory Notes Add Fuel to the Fire

Yesterday, the rising trend spread widely, and the price increases exceeded general expectations.

Today is a holiday, which actually provides an opportunity. In recent weeks, the market has often fluctuated during holidays. Given the current macroeconomic environment, creating new data could give everyone a "good show."

Prices are bound to equalize, which is why economics has the concept of "price level."

The continuous rise in rice and coal prices while general prices remained stagnant led us to conclude that a comprehensive price surge was imminent. However, yesterday's price surge was so strong that the issuance of large-denomination promissory notes by the Central Bank had a significant stimulating effect.

The four denominations of 5,000, 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 yuan promissory notes are undoubtedly equivalent to disguised large-denomination Gold Yuan certificates of 5,000, 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 yuan.

The Central Bank stated that the reason for issuing large-denomination promissory notes was to alleviate the cash shortage.

Recently, due to the shortage of cash, promissory notes and checks have been subject to substantial discounts. The market needs cash, but the Central Bank issues promissory notes, which is like giving stones to starving people who need food.

Yesterday, it was said that a 10,000-yuan promissory note or check could only be exchanged for 8,000 yuan in cash.

Instead of finding ways to increase the supply of cash, the Central Bank increased the supply of promissory notes. With the supply of promissory notes exceeding demand, the discount will only increase.

Isn't this equivalent to adding fuel to the fire?

If one believes that Central Bank promissory notes will not be discounted, I truly do not know why they would "not."

If one argues that Central Bank promissory notes can be readily exchanged for cash, and therefore will not be discounted, then why doesn't the Central Bank simply issue cash? Why take the extra step of issuing promissory notes?

The reason for issuing promissory notes instead of cash is that promissory notes are less convenient than cash, because they need to be processed through a bank. Converting them to cash takes time, and with interest rates so high, a discount is inevitable.

Paying Salaries with Promissory Notes Aggravates Small Clerks

It's the end of the month, the time for paying wages and salaries, and the need for cash is extremely urgent. The Central Bank is not supplying cash, but instead supplying promissory notes. As a result, most people will receive wages and salaries in the form of promissory notes this month.

### Departing Foreign Soldiers Issue Challenge; Sino-American Clash Tonight

The two U.S. Navy teams, Pfeiffer and McLain, will transfer and leave Shanghai tomorrow. To mark their farewell, they have joined forces with elite players from Nacas to form the U.S. All-Stars team, challenging the Chinese league champion, Hua Lian. The match is scheduled for 7:30 PM tonight at the Municipal Gymnasium. Before the main event, there will be a curtain-raiser match between the Basketball Committee and You Yi team. To avoid overcrowding, ticket prices have been adjusted slightly. Upstairs seating remains at 500 yuan, while downstairs seating is 1,500 yuan, and courtside seating is 1,000 yuan. Reserved seating will be available for pre-sale starting at 10:00 AM, and the other two types of tickets will go on sale starting at 1:00 PM. The gymnasium doors will open at 5:00 PM. The Si Wei Boy Scouts will be on hand to maintain order. The three original league games scheduled for today have been postponed.

The Basketball Committee consists of many veterans of the basketball scene, such as Chairman Qian Xuchang, Captain Zhou Jun, and Wu Zibin, Chen Yong'an, and Chen Weiyuan. Xie Yiqin and Lin Zuoshi are also formidable players. Their strength should not be underestimated. You Yi has had mediocre results since joining the Class B league, but enjoys strong fan support. Their players Su Shifeng, Wang Xuewu, Wei Yuping, Zhang Fa, and Jin Yan are all skilled. A fierce battle is inevitable when they face the veterans of the Basketball Committee.

Hua Lian has won the league championship for the past three consecutive years and is poised to win this year's title as well. They are virtually unchallenged in Shanghai. Under the leadership of Li Zhenzhong and Ren Xiangcheng, the veterans and newcomers such as Adi and Xiao Leizi have a good understanding and are skilled and technically proficient. The U.S. All-Stars team is a formidable opponent, and Hua Lian will have to go all out to maintain their reputation.

The U.S. All-Stars team combines the best players from McLain, Pfeiffer, and Nacas, including the tall player Lis, the African-American player Brown, and Botou, Ikater, Keller, and others, all of whom are energetic and skilled. Chely Bretto is intelligent and knowledgeable about Hua Lian's strategy, making him a formidable opponent. In short, the departing foreign soldiers are launching an all-out assault, hoping to defeat the champion. It is clear that they come with ill intentions. The clash between the Chinese and Western powerhouses will be exciting and intense, creating an unprecedented spectacle.

### Today's Basketball League Games All Postponed

The Basketball League originally had three Class A games scheduled for today, but both Nacas and Chong De requested postponements. Additionally, due to the U.S. All-Stars' challenge to Hua Lian, it has been decided to postpone all games. The Class A Hua Lian vs. Shanghai Police game on the 31st has also been postponed. The organizers have rescheduled the games as follows:

April 8 (Friday)

Shan Team vs. Chen You (Class B, D Group) 5:30 PM

Hai Qing vs. Nacas (Class A Group) 6:30 PM

Hua Lian vs. Shanghai Police (Class A Group) 7:30 PM

April 12 (Tuesday)

Red Knights vs. (Class B, D Group) 5:30 PM

### Youth Day Celebration Basketball Games

The Municipal Gymnasium has accepted an invitation from the Shanghai All-Circles Youth Day Preparatory Committee to hold two basketball games starting at 9:00 AM today, followed by children's gymnastics performances and children's table tennis matches in the afternoon. The basketball game schedule is: (1) Xin Hua vs. Jin Gang at 9:00 AM (2) Zhao Guang vs. Nan Mo at 10:00 AM.

### Democracy Cup Kicks Off Today; Railway Disguises Itself as Zhong Yi

To commemorate Youth Day, the Municipal Stadium will hold the opening match of the Democracy Cup Senior Group Football Tournament, Samsung vs. Zhong Lin, at 4:00 PM today in the South City Stadium. Samsung is actually the Railway team, which won the Mayor's Cup the other day, with the exact same lineup, without a single change. The only difference is the organizer of the team. Therefore, it can be said that it is one team with two names. Although Zhong Yi is an unfamiliar team, the players are actually familiar faces. Judging from their lineup, it is clear that it is just old wine in new bottles. Samsung is known for its bold and fast-paced play, while Zhong Yi also adopts a straightforward style, with few fancy moves. The match between the two teams will be a good test of their abilities. Zi Wen and Lu Qingxiang, who played for Xin Xian Lin in the South City League, were unable to show their full potential. Their return to the team this time is self-explanatory. The referee is Wang Lin, and the linesmen are Ni Shiyao and Fang Rongfu. Admission is 700 yuan. The team lineups are as follows:

Samsung

Liao Xiong

Yue Renxiao Wu Jiabang

Lu Bingsheng Gao Baozheng Cao Liming

Wu Binghao Xiao Ziwen Zhang Jie Lu Qingxiang Lin Dianyi

Zhong Yi

Xian Boming Sun Hanxing Zhou Bingrong

Yu Zhenyue Zhao Yongfang Zhao Zhenhui

### Ren Yu Defeats Pfeiffer; Hui Li Loses to McLain

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday evening, the two Class A basketball league games were: (1) McLain defeated Hui Li, 63 to 42, with the first half score being 24 to 22. (2) Ren Yu defeated Pfeiffer, 51 to 43, with the first half tied at 28. The second game was more intense. Ren Yu scored twelve consecutive points in the final four minutes to secure the victory. The 2,000-plus spectators were ecstatic, and their cheers reverberated outside.

McLain is a fast-breaking team. In the first half, Hui Li held their positions and managed to cope. In the second half, Hui Li's stamina waned, and they replaced several young players, who could only assist but not fully contribute. As a result, under McLain's relentless attack, Hui Li gradually fell behind. After 37 to 30, the situation became irreversible. Although Hui Li called six timeouts, it was to no avail.

In the second game, Ren Yu faced Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer scored the first five points, and Ren Yu called a timeout. Xu Zhongyi and Shen Pengju then scored with consecutive throws and fouls, surpassing Pfeiffer with a score of 6 to 5. From then on, the game was balanced, with each team showing their skills. Xu Shenxinyun repeatedly penetrated the defense, and Keller also made frequent contributions. The score was tied three times at 18, 22, and 26, until the end of the first half, with each team scoring 28 points, evenly matched.

In the second half, Pengju scored first, but Galach Brownet scored continuously, making the score 39 to 33. Li Sun Xu quickly chased, making the situation extremely tense. In the last four minutes, the score was 39 to 43. Ren Yu gritted their teeth, and Zhongyi, Pengju, Guozheng, and Xinyun scored twelve consecutive points. Pfeiffer was at a loss, and Ren Yu finally won with a score of 51 to 43.

The Mei Feng team will also travel to Wuxi at the beginning of next month.

### Xiangdao Ball News (Hong Kong Soccer Report)

[Hong Kong Airlines News] Last weekend's First Division Football League had a total of six matches. The results were: (1) South China South defeated Hong Kong Club 3-1, (2) Bus Team defeated China Club 2-0, (3) Army Team defeated Delegation Team 4-2, (4) Kitchee Club defeated Air Force Team 3-0, (5) Kwong Wah Club tied South China Wah 3-3, (6) Navy Team defeated Eastern Club 7-1.

Bus Wins Over China by Two Goals

It was drizzling on Saturday, but the games went on as scheduled. The match between China and Bus deserves special mention because it was related to the runner-up position. On this day, both teams made changes to their left wings. During the match, Bus dominated the midfield. Although China's forwards were dangerous when pressing the goal, their center-backs were too busy covering, and completely failed to send any power forward. In addition, China's two inside forwards didn't come back to help much, so Bus often broke the formation into two segments. If it weren't for goalkeeper Yu Qi'en's outstanding performance, Bus would have lost by more than two goals.

South South Easily Takes Down Tai-ke

The battle between South China South and Hong Kong Club, although a rainy match, did not affect the ball control ability of both sides. Only the wet and heavy ball slipping was difficult for the two goalkeepers. Nan Nan's own goal was proof of that, but it cannot be entirely blamed on Yu Yaode's fumble, but rather his foot hooked the ball into the goal by mistake. As for the three goals that Tai-ke lost, they were not unjustified. Looking at the advantage of Nan Nan yesterday, if it were not for Fo-ye and Hei-zai who were cautious due to new injuries and did not dare to bravely charge, losing many scoring opportunities, and the "Da Pu Ting's" penalty kick feast, Tai-ke would have lost at least six goals. It is not an exaggeration to say that.

However, "the final verdict is made," although Tai-ke lost, they did not play too badly. The initial vigorous offensive created by Chia-neng and Wu-lun's linking, was dangerous enough; but the undeniable mistake was that Bickford, who was usually on the left wing, was transferred to the defense, trying to contain He Yingfen's progress, but it was inevitable that he was using talent improperly and counterproductively. All three goals won by Nan Nan came from opportunities found on the left. Jing is the main reason for Tai-ke's defeat in this match.

However, the long-winning army's unbeaten record is also entirely the deserved result of technical skills. The offense, defense, advance, and retreat all had wonderful performances. Although Hou Yusheng was in the bad conditions of rainy and slippery ground, he still had bold and neat style of play, and Xie Jinhong's sitting in the center-back, with a majestic and heroic demeanor, are really endearing. Liu Songsheng and Zhang Jinhai's performances are "gradually returning to their old form" compared to the "Governor's Cup" match. Fo-ye and Hei-zai's comeback made the fans see their wonderful passing and elusive feints again, which is truly pleasing to the eye. Second Uncle leads the three armies, directing the charge, not letting the teenagers. Fei Chunhua's reluctant acceptance of the right wing, and Zhu Jincheng's using "B" material as "A" material, is also barely satisfactory. But strictly speaking, Nan Nan's forwards still cannot get rid of the slow-moving problem. I hope that they can "bravely" improve in the future, so that they will not "fall short of success"! The lineups of both sides in this match are as follows:

South China South

Yu Yaode

Zhang Shuling Hou Rongsheng

Liu Songsheng Xie Jinhong Zhang Jinhai

He Yingfen Li Zhaorong Feng Jingxiang Fei Chunhua Zhu Jincheng

Hong Kong Club

Chicks and Proud Soldiers Tie With Kwong Wah

The battle between South China's fledgling team and Kwong Wah, judging from the usual performances of the two teams, South China should have won the two points in this match. However, after seventy minutes of lackluster and dull game, Kwong Wah was able to tie the chicks 3-3, which is truly a "miracle"!

Looking at the complete lack of fighting spirit and cooperation of Kwong Wah's generals in the first half, especially when Guo Wentian was injured and left the field, and they were fighting with ten men, the "playing" was really like catkins沾泥, and they simply gave the chicks control of the entire scene, taking whatever they wanted. In less than fifteen minutes, South China won three goals, which shows how disorganized Kwong Wah was at that time.

However, as the game continued, the generals of South China gradually "recovered" their "arrogant" state, but they did not know that this was the loophole that caused them to win. On the contrary, after Guo Wentian returned to the battle, the morale of the entire Kwong Wah army was high, and they fought more and more bravely, and finally recovered the lost ground one after another. What this game gave the audience was not any wonderful and exciting process, but only a repetition of the historical lesson that "an arrogant army will be defeated."

### Usury in Rural Areas of Jiangnan

— Qi Nian

Years of war, although Jiangnan has not directly suffered the disaster of artillery fire, the rural economy has become increasingly collapsed. Farmers work hard all year round, and the price of rice and grain they get is already astounding, but the rate of increase is still far less than that of other goods. In terms of customs, they are becoming increasingly extravagant, and consumption expenses are naturally increasing invisibly. What's more, the main land tax is increasing year by year; the burden of military service is even more urgent than fire. Therefore, in today's Jiangnan farmers, those who are not heavily indebted are probably one in ten.

In the past, pawnshops were institutions for regulating the economy of the poor, but today, due to the changes of the times, they have disappeared. Therefore, if there is a shortage of funds, the only way out is to borrow money. Since there are loans, there is interest. In a situation where there are many borrowers and few lenders, a variety of usury has been brewed in the current rural areas.

Two years ago, borrowing in the countryside, with a monthly interest rate of three cents, was considered high interest. Because the authorities once issued a strict ban, both borrowers and lenders were afraid of the order, and the flow of money was carried out secretly. However, not long after, the currency value dropped sharply, and even if the lenders took heavy interest, it was not enough to compensate for the loss of depreciation. Therefore, no one with money was willing to lend it. With a change of mind, they changed to lending physical objects as the main thing. In this way, they could both protect their principal and get their interest, which is a double benefit. Up to now, borrowers quench their thirst with poison, and lenders get more and more, and the interest rates have increased.

The most common is the "half grain head," which means that if you borrow one grain of rice, you have to pay back one and a half grains of rice after the rice is harvested. Among today's usury, it is still considered the lightest. In addition, there are similar names such as "six grains," "seven grains," etc. In other words, if you borrow one stone of rice, the interest must be increased to six or seven dou, depending on the supply and demand relationship at the time of borrowing.

The above kind generally has a time of one full year. As for short-term ones, there is a kind called "monthly payment," which is the most exploitative. For example, if you borrow one stone of rice, the term can be determined according to the needs of the borrower, but you must pay one dou of interest every month. In addition, during the New Year, gambling is very popular in rural areas, and betting with rice is a common occurrence. Gamblers often want to make a comeback, and even if they seek loans, they do not hesitate to make a desperate bet. The interest rate on such loans is even more alarming, called "lottery money," which is generally calculated on a daily basis, and the interest of each stone has to be as much as a dou of rice, which can be said to be frightening.

The shrewd moneylenders also have so-called "wheat buns." The meaning is that although the wheat of the villagers is still in the seedling stage, they have already sold it to the price master. However, its price is often half the market price. This profit from lowering the price is indirectly the interest. The same kind of nature is still available to put "rice buns", its meaning is also the same, but to wheat instead of rice only. The time for borrowing is mostly after the Lunar New Year for the former, and around the time when wheat is on the market for the latter. In a short period of three to several months, the principal and interest must be paid. For the sake of urgency, the rural farmers drink salt brine, and they can't care about so many. It is said that ruthless lenders take advantage of the repeated lending of "wheat buns" and "rice buns," and the profits are so great that the physical objects are actually several times their principal in a year.

Recently, the situation has been turbulent, and people with money seem to be deeply wary of lending money. Recently, there has been crying and sobbing in the tea shops, and the poor people are almost suffering from the pain of not being able to borrow money. In this situation, even the most harsh usury has to be endured with tears.

### What I Saw in the Countryside

— Xu Dasan

On vacation back home, met with the conscription frenzy. On the Lantern Festival, the county magistrate personally went to the countryside to supervise the conscription, convened a meeting of rural保長, prohibited public attendance, and had strict security. As the news spread, everyone talked about "soldiers" with fear. On this night, several eligible young men in the village hired a small boat together, temporarily acting as water residents, and took turns guarding, waiting for news. If there was any news, they would gently row to another river to avoid the wind. After a night of returning, everyone silently rejoiced that nothing happened.

The story of Shi Hao Li is recognized as the masterpiece of anti-war literature. If I had talent, then today's situation would not be inferior to Shi Hao Li. The records of military service in the past dynasties can be described as extremely cruel. At the end of the Tang Dynasty, the藩鎭 rebelled. Flames of war everywhere. When Liang Tai-feng was in藩鎭, the law was particularly strict. If the generals were killed in battle, all the soldiers under his command were beheaded, which was called "拔隊斬". Most of the soldiers who lost their main generals fled and dared not return. Tai-zu ordered that all soldiers be tattooed on their faces to record the military number. If the soldiers or villagers escaped, Guanze would arrest them and send them to their subordinates, and none would die. The villagers also dared not tolerate them, so the escapees gathered in the mountains and lakes and became bandits, which was a great problem for the prefectures and counties.

The Biography of Liu Shouguang in the Old History of the Five Dynasties also has similar records: Liu Rengong exhausted all the men in his department, over the age of fifteen and under the age of seventy, and tattooed their faces, writing "定覇都". Scholars tattooed their arms, writing "一心事主". A total of 200,000 people were obtained. Even the literati were not spared in addition to the soldiers. The tragic events in troubled times are really frightening. Some time ago, it was reported that the commander of a garrison in a certain place, in order to prevent prisoners from escaping, ordered the prisoners to leave a tuft of hair on their heads when they shaved their heads to show identification. Leaving hair instead of tattooing their faces, compared to the past, this garrison commander can be said to be much more civilized.

Modern people say: Sincerity is "〇".

### Rambling Examination of Kites

— Qian Dacheng

Since the beginning of spring, I have often seen children flying kites with great joy. I lingered and lingered, and couldn't leave; I felt that my childlike innocence could be found, and I was more comforted. Returning home and flipping through miscellaneous books, I wrote "Rambling Examination of Kites".

Paper recommendations are commonly known as pigeons, and they have existed since the Qi and Liang Dynasties. Ming Chen Meigong's Bai Shiqiao Zhen manuscript "Distinguishing Kites" says: "During the time of Qi Wenxuan Gao Yang,... Zhu Zhu Yuan,... Pengcheng Wang Xie's grandson, Shao, was imprisoned in a dungeon. His cousin Huang Tou'er ordered him and the prisoners to fly each with a paper kite from the Jin Feng Building. Huang Tou alone was able to fly to Zimo before falling...." The Miscellaneous Records say: "Hou Jing besieged the Taicheng (Liang). Jianwen made paper recommendations to fly in the air and asked for help from the outside..." The use of kites is not just for games, one is for executing people, and one is for asking for help. Later, Tang Gao Pian once wrote a kite poem, with the phrase "The sound of strings is heard in the quiet night in the blue sky, and the palace sound trusts the wind back and forth." "Xunchu Lu" says: "Li Ye of the Five Dynasties made paper kites in the palace, pulling the thread and riding the wind for play; later, he used bamboo as a flute on the head of the kite, so that the wind entered the bamboo, and the sound was like a zither, so it was named a kite." However, now the kites without bamboo flutes on their heads are also called kites.

There are also people in later generations who wrote kite poems to entrust satire, such as Song Zhuang Jiyu's "Chicken Rib Chapter" which records that Lu Huiqing ordered a Taoist to write a poem with the theme of kites, and the Taoist responded and wrote: "Because of the wind, they are stimulated in the clouds, and the noisy children look up; don't let the silk be too much and let it fly high, but also prevent the wind from being tight and it is difficult to collect." The meaning outside the string can be known. A Ming person named Shui An also has a poem that says: "I am full of watching the hurricane go away, and my feelings are like paper. I am strong and fight with it to the end. Don't let the scenery all be used up, and the spring breeze will also have a time to end." Infinite emotion, can really be used as a warning song.

The ancients said: After Qingming, the wind is soft and weak, and this game is no longer played. Our Changshu nursery rhyme also says: "Kites are flown on Qingming, turtles are flown." Although the language is vulgar, it also implies the meaning of not being extremely happy.
