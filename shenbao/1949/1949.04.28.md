### President Chiang's Message to the Nation: Accept Lessons, Strive for Comprehensive Reform, Unite and Fight for Final Victory

[Central News Agency, Xikou, 27th] President Chiang recently issued a message to the nation, the full text of which is as follows:

Fellow countrymen! Now the Communist bandits have forcibly crossed the Yangtze River, and Nanjing has already been evacuated. Our patriotic soldiers and civilians fought bravely for eight years, and the capital recovered from the iron hooves of Japanese warlords has fallen into the iron curtain of the Communist International after less than four years. Today, facing this dark violence that ravages the freedom of the people, destroys national independence, and threatens world peace, the life and death of every citizen are inextricably linked to the survival of the entire nation. Although I, Chiang Kai-shek, have retired to private life, as a member of the nation, I still feel a great responsibility for the country's crisis and the suffering of my compatriots. At this time of anxiety and turmoil, I reiterate my determination to share weal and woe with my fellow countrymen and offer my sincere words to my patriotic soldiers and civilians.

During the war against Japan, our only major problem was to persevere in the war and strive for victory. After the victory of the war, the Communist Party problem became our only major problem. Therefore, as soon as the war against Japan came to an end, I exhausted all my efforts to find a political solution. We know that the Communist Party problem is an international problem and cannot be solved by China alone. However, at that time, we believed that if this problem could be solved peacefully by China itself or by the international community, the fruits of the war could be preserved, the people could recuperate, national construction could proceed smoothly, and world peace and security would not be threatened. Therefore, our government at that time, with the greatest sincerity, spared no effort to make concessions, convened a Political Consultative Conference, accepted American military mediation, and issued cease-fire orders four times to promote the success of a peaceful settlement. Unexpectedly, after more than a year of negotiations and mediation, the Communist Party not only showed no sincerity in seeking peace, but also intensified its perverse actions, using the cover of peaceful talks and military mediation, and the opportunity of the cease-fire with the National Army, to advance into the Northeast, obstruct the National Army from taking over the sovereignty of the Northeast, and cross the Yellow River southward to expand the war in the Central Plains. At this point, the government had no choice but to take military action and actively suppress the bandits. At the time of establishing the suppression policy, we knew that if the suppression military operations could not achieve success within one or two years, not only would the people's suffering deepen like water, but also Asian security and world peace would be seriously affected. Our China would become the battlefield of the Third World War, and the world's humanity would suffer unprecedented calamities together. Therefore, the government concentrated its forces, mobilized for war, and strived to implement the suppression policy and complete military operations quickly, in order to save the country from danger and eliminate human warfare. However, due to our political and military shortcomings, the misunderstanding of people at home and abroad, and the infiltration of Communist Party propaganda and espionage activities, our internal affairs, diplomacy, and morale could not adapt to the needs of suppression mobilization, which led to the serious situation today.

### The Democratic Nations Cannot Shirk Responsibility for the Evolution of the Serious Situation

This year, on New Year's Day, I reiterated the policy of peacefully resolving the Chinese Communist problem and retired to private life in order to promote the realization of peace. In the past three months, Acting President Li endured humiliation and bore heavy burdens, dealing with the Communists, making concessions and seeking complete accommodation. However, during this period, the Communist Party openly issued a declaration to help Soviet Russia in the Third World War, exposing its face as an international fifth column. Then, it put forward its so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement" of eight articles and twenty-four clauses, forcing our national army to disarm and surrender to the bandits, removing the guarantees of our national independence and people's freedom. Finally, it issued its general attack order, broke through our Yangtze River defense line, and launched a large-scale invasion of the south of the Yangtze River. This time, the Communist Party's destruction of peaceful negotiations and continued expansion of the chaos with a violent and dictatorial attitude completely proves that its purpose is not peace, but war. More precisely, its purpose is not for China's peace and people's livelihood, but for the invasion and conquest of China. It wants to turn my 12 million square kilometers of territory into a base for the Communist International in the Third World War, to use my 450 million compatriots as cannon fodder for the Third World War, to destroy my Chinese nation's 5,000 years of noble and excellent history and culture without leaving any trace, and to transform our Chinese ethics based on love and peace into cold and cruel struggle, participating in international massacres. The evolution of this serious situation has always been in our agonizing thoughts. This is not only a critical moment for the survival of China, but also the democratic countries of the world cannot avoid its impact, nor can they shirk their due responsibilities.

I am Willing to Follow the Soldiers and Civilians in Struggle in a Private Capacity

Compatriots! We have seen through the Communist bandits' conspiracy to destroy the motherland and sell out the nation. We have learned the lessons of the two failures of peaceful negotiations. We can only unite and fight back with one heart and soul against the tyrannical and brutal advance of the bandits. Our current situation is certainly dangerous, and our future battles will also be arduous. However, we recognize that today's bandit suppression war is a national war against aggression, a democratic war against totalitarianism, and also a social war for the free way of life of every citizen and every family, and a cultural war to protect our long history, excellent culture, and peaceful and loving ethics and morality. The final outcome of this war will determine the survival of the entire country, and will determine the life, death, fortune, and misfortune of every citizen and family. If this anti-aggression war fails, the country's independent and free status and the people's free way of life will be destroyed. Our future will only be widespread poverty, cold hunger, and world war. If this anti-aggression and anti-communist war can succeed, then the country will be an independent country, the people will be free people, and it will make a glorious contribution to world peace and security. At this moment of life and death for the country and the nation, I am willing to follow my patriotic soldiers and civilians in a private capacity, support Acting President Li and Premier He in leading the war, and fight to the end. Now this war has begun! Today, we can only be under one government, with our attitude towards the Communists as the touchstone of loyalty and treachery. All anti-communist policies must be thoroughly implemented, and all bandit suppression orders must be absolutely obeyed. Today, we can only stand together under the great cause of the nation, regardless of occupation or class, regardless of personal grievances, all those who are unwilling to be slaves of the Communist International, who cannot sit idly by and watch the demise of the nation's history and culture, who cannot sit idly by and watch the loss of ancestral tombs and fields, and the separation of families, husbands, wives, and children, all those who are anti-communist, anti-aggression, and anti-totalitarianism, unite sincerely, concentrate our strength, concentrate our will, never give up, and fight to the end. I firmly believe that we will be able to overcome the current crisis and achieve final victory.

Remove Dependency Mentality, Wash Away Wishful Thinking

Compatriots, our China was originally a poor and weak country, but it is indeed an independent great power in the East Asian continent, and it has a glorious and unparalleled history of fighting for national independence, national freedom, and for democratic peace. Today, our suppression of the Communists is to fight for independence and freedom and for the survival of every individual, and also to fight for world security and human happiness. Today, we stand at the forefront of anti-aggression and act as the vanguard of the world's anti-communist struggle, regardless of the Communist International's slander and the democratic countries' perceptions. We believe that there will always be justice in the world, and mankind must uphold justice. As long as we do our best, we will certainly not be alone in the international community. However, we must remove the mentality of dependence, and especially wash away the mentality of wishful thinking. The Chinese Communists have already issued a declaration on April 4, solemnly vowing to help Soviet Russia in the Third World War. They have no national consciousness or national thought at all, and they have no love or sense of responsibility for the motherland and compatriots. After the two failures of peaceful negotiations, we must never imagine that the Communist bandits will change their policies, nor can we hope that there is still a possibility of peaceful compromise. We must know that Mao Zedong is willing to depend on the Communist International and act as a tool for the expansionist policies of aggressive countries. His treachery is the same as that of Wang Jingwei, but his background is deeper and his behavior is more sinister, far beyond what Wang Jingwei can compare. Wang Jingwei lost confidence in the war of resistance and surrendered to the Japanese warlords during the period when our war of resistance against Japan suffered setbacks, in order to seek a place for his personal survival. But today's Mao Zedong, after our war of resistance has been victorious, the country's independent and autonomous status has been established, construction projects are sprouting and growing, and the people's lives are about to move towards restoration and progress, unexpectedly lost his mind and frantically led his Communist bandits to painstakingly destroy the fruits of the victory of the war of resistance, undermine the country's independent and autonomous status, obstruct the country's construction, and hinder the people's restoration and recuperation, willing to use China's territorial sovereignty as a sacrifice for his betrayal and seeking glory. Every step he takes and every action he takes is to implement international conspiracies and carry out arrogant ambitions. How can Wang Jingwei be expected to reach his level? Today, facing this unprecedented culprit in 5,000 years of history, we can only restore our revolutionary spirit, exert our own strength, grasp the weaknesses of the bandit army, and continue to fight to the end. Otherwise, if we have a slight dependence, we will only be indolent and let others slaughter us. If we compromise halfway, we will only surrender, and we will only be beheaded and seek our own destruction.

Unwavering Belief in Saving the Country and the People, Military, Government, and People United as One, The Opportunity to Turn Danger into Safety is Today

We admit the repeated failures in the Northeast and North China in the past. We anticipate that the current situation may worsen, but we will never be discouraged or disappointed. We must know that our past failures were not because the strength of the bandit army was so strong, but because of our political shortcomings, economic panic, and loose internal organization, which allowed the Communist bandits to take advantage of the gaps, so they were able to recklessly ambush spies between our front-line troops and the rear civilians, and spread the poison of defeatism to disintegrate morale and morale, so the National Army, with its superior military strength, suffered serious setbacks instead. I, Chiang Kai-shek, should bear a major responsibility for the past political and economic defects and the failure of the bandit suppression military operations, which caused our compatriots to suffer the ravages and massacres of the Communist bandits and fall into the iron curtain of communism, living this dark hell life, because my understanding of the Communist Party's conspiracies and atrocities is particularly profound, so my guilt is particularly painful for the country's difficulties and the people's disasters. However, I will never waver in my belief in saving the country and the people, and I am sure that we will be able to save my fellow countrymen from the communist iron curtain and regain the realm of freedom and well-being. The ancients said: "Lose in the east, gain in the west." Today, as long as my fellow countrymen across the country rise up together, support the government, and urge the government to make timely reforms in politics and have a certain direction in the economy, and the military and government cadres can thoroughly awaken and strengthen the organization, as long as we accept the lessons of failure, make failure a tempering and refining, achieve the effect of washing our hearts and renewing our faces in politics, achieve the merit of eliminating the weak and retaining the strong in the military, and integrate the excellent talents of military and political affairs with the people's self-defense activities, opening up a vast source of strength for the bandit suppression military force, I firmly believe that the opportunity for our country to turn danger into safety is today, when the Communist bandits cross the river and penetrate deeply.

Compatriots, we must also know that crossing the river is the highest peak of the bandit army's development, and at the same time it is the exposure of the bandit party's greatest weakness. In other words, it is the beginning of his failure. Of course, after the bandit army crosses the river, our people in South China will encounter the same darkness and pain as our compatriots in North China and the Northeast, but the brightness and final victory of our country and people's future is also here, because in terms of strategy and tactics, the Communist bandits have followed the same path as the Japanese warlords' invasion of the south and falling into the quagmire. The reason why Japan was eager to invade the south was to realize its dream of controlling the whole of China before the Second World War, and today's fifth column of the Third International, the Communist bandits, also delusionally want to control the whole of China before the Third World War, so as to replenish the Communist International's manpower, material resources, and resources to cope with the world war, making the same mistake as the Japanese warlords. The casting of this big mistake is the gene for his self-destruction, and it is also the guarantee for our China's final victory in suppressing the Communists. After the victory of the war of resistance, I said to the Shanghai Mass Rally: "We have to fight hard for another eight years, using the same spirit as the past eight years of war of resistance to prepare for sacrifice and endure suffering, so that we can achieve true victory and success." I said this for today. Compatriots, do not be discouraged, do not be pessimistic, as long as you rise up and are determined to fight, the Communist bandits will not be able to destroy our country, nor can they enslave ourselves. In less than three years, the final victory will surely be ours.

Accept the Leadership of the Acting President, Obey the Command of Minister He

Compatriots, the danger of the country's demise and the individual's disaster are very urgent, and the reasons why the Communist bandits will be defeated and the anti-communists will win are also very clear. The battle to save the country and save ourselves has already begun. Eleven years ago, the evacuation of Nanjing and the westward movement of the government were the starting point of our government's long-term war of resistance against Japan. Today, the evacuation of Nanjing and the southward movement of the government have become the only turning point in our China's anti-communist struggle. It is hoped that our soldiers and civilians across the country will accept the leadership of Acting President Li, and all officers and soldiers will absolutely obey the command of Minister He, eliminate the mentality of defeatism, exert all available strength, support the sacred and solemn war against aggression, anti-communism, seeking survival, seeking freedom, saving the country, and protecting democracy, and achieve the realm of final success. I, Chiang Kai-shek, have led the National Army and served the government for more than 20 years. The faults and omissions are seen by the people of the country and are guilty in my heart. However, I am confident that my loyalty to the country and love for the people can be testified to by heaven and earth without shame. At this critical moment of the country's survival, the nation's life and death, and the continuation of history and culture, I will always be consistent, follow my patriotic soldiers and civilians across the country, do my best, exterminate the fifth column of the Communist International - the Communist bandits, promote the revival of the Chinese nation, restore the independence, democracy, and freedom of the Republic of China, and realize the Three Principles of the People to complete the national revolution. Final success belongs to those who make the final effort. I hope my fellow countrymen across the country will encourage each other.

### US ECA Materials Suspended from Shipping to Shanghai, Relief Rice Continues to be Shipped to Shanghai

[US Information Service, Washington, 26th] According to officials of the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) here, the shipment of materials to Shanghai under the US ECA's aid-to-China program has been suspended. Cleveland, director of the agency's China program group, revealed today that 8 million U.S. dollars worth of raw cotton, now packaged in 17 ships, is en route to Shanghai. Five of these ships have already been diverted to Kobe, Japan, and it is expected that the remaining ships will also first head to Japan and then possibly to other Far Eastern regions that can use cotton. Although the ECA has stopped shipping materials to Shanghai, it will continue its aid program in areas of China not under Communist Party control. Supplies will be shipped to Guangzhou, Shantou, and Taiwan. The main materials shipped to Taiwan are chemical fertilizers, as Taiwan does not need food. Materials shipped to other areas will include rice, petroleum products, fertilizers, and some raw cotton.

[United Press, Washington, 26th] The United States today stopped shipping cotton to Shanghai, but US aid to Shanghai in the form of relief rice continues to be shipped, but it is not certain how long it can be maintained. According to Economic Cooperation Administration personnel, once the Communists occupy Shanghai, the transport of grain and other supplies to the area will automatically cease. Congress recently passed a continuing appropriation of $54 million in aid to China, stipulating that it be used only in non-Communist areas. The ECA stipulates that Shanghai has 12,671,000 yuan worth of relief supplies, including cotton, fertilizer, flour, and rice.

### Attlee Reports to the House of Commons; Britain Takes a Reserved Stance on the Communist Army's Shelling of British Warships; Churchill and Others Raise Questions

[Reuters, London, 26th] Prime Minister Attlee told a crowded and tense House of Commons that due to the still turbulent situation in China, Britain reserves its position on the incident in which four British warships were shelled by the communist army in the Yangtze River, causing significant casualties.

[Associated Press, London, 26th] Prime Minister Attlee stated in the House of Commons on the 26th that Britain will take all possible steps to protect British nationals in China. However, Britain will continue to adhere to the US-British-Soviet Moscow Agreement of 1945 regarding the Chinese situation and adopt a policy of non-interference. Conservative Party leader Churchill and many other members of parliament raised questions and attacked the Labor government regarding the communist army's shelling of four British warships in the Yangtze River. Labor members shouted "The Conservative Party wants war" to drown out various questions.

Churchill stated that the Yangtze River incident was an outrage, and the government should have delegated all responsibility to the Commander of the British Navy in China and sent an aircraft carrier for an effective counterattack. The government should take decisive steps to ensure that we are respected in the future.

Attlee explained that the British warship "Amethyst" entered the war zone with "correct" procedures. The other warships were heading to rescue the "Amethyst" and had no other mission, and there was no question of suppression. The British warships only opened fire to destroy the troops shelling them.

Attlee's explanation failed to satisfy the questioners, and some Labor members also expressed dissatisfaction.

[Reuters, London, 26th] Prime Minister Attlee revealed in Parliament on the 26th that Yu De, a secretary at the British Embassy in Nanjing who went to the communist area on the opposite bank of Nanjing to negotiate a cessation of shelling of British warships, revealed that the central authorities were prepared to allow the British warship "Amethyst" to sail to Nanjing, but the warship must assist the communist army in crossing the river. Attlee said this condition was clearly unacceptable to Britain.

[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 27th] The British cruiser "Belfast" has left here for Wusong to serve as the flagship of Vice Admiral Madden, Deputy Commander of the British Far East Fleet. The original flagship "London" was damaged in the Yangtze River shelling.

### Britain Decides to Maintain Hong Kong; Kai Tak Airport Opens All Night to Await Evacuation Planes from Shanghai

[Reuters, London, 27th] Undersecretary of the British Colonial Office Williams stated here today that the British government is determined to maintain Hong Kong as a peaceful paradise for refugees fleeing oppression and will continue to make it a center for trade, culture, and education. Hong Kong is a trading hub and a democratic showcase for the Far East. Despite the rapid population increase, it still maintains the highest living standards in the Far East. Williams made the remarks while welcoming a Hong Kong trade delegation attending the British Labor Party Congress. He said that the world's attention is now focused on China, where the people are in a state of disorder, major cities have fallen into chaos, and millions of men, women, and children are homeless. Fortunately, there is still Hong Kong, a small place, but still a center of prosperity and peace.

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 27th] Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon is open all night to await the arrival of evacuation planes from Shanghai.

The greater the extent of the Gold Yuan's inflation, the more rampant the rise in prices, this is an inevitable phenomenon, especially in the last two days, prices have risen day by day, and the Gold Yuan is constantly depreciating, clearly it has lost its monetary function. But if we reflect, who exactly is to blame for the Gold Yuan ending up with such a tragic fate? Originally, using issuance as a cash cow, as a balance for public finance, is an unwise plan, to know that the credit of paper money is completely based on general belief, if you do not control credit, and create purchasing power without limit, of course you cannot blame the people for no longer using it as a store of value and a means of exchange.

Now, from a legal point of view, the Gold Yuan is still the only legal tender, but looking at the general practical situation in society, the Gold Yuan has undoubtedly been reduced to a kind of subsidiary currency for silver dollars, this phenomenon has long been rampant among the people, this goes without saying, even from the official perspective, such as the army issuing salaries in silver dollars, the income and expenditure of provinces and cities such as Yunnan, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Fuzhou, and Lanzhou, have all openly adopted silver dollars as a unit, the fare for Hunan highway buses, is also based on the price of silver dollars, the central bank even gives out a portion of silver dollars when paying its banking associates, as the trend develops, silver dollars have indeed taken over the position of the Gold Yuan. However, until the government formally recognizes its status, it is still a contradictory phenomenon, with many latent difficulties, for example, when soldiers receive their salaries in silver dollars, it is difficult for banks to cope with requests to deposit or remit them, and there are many inconveniences in pricing goods in Gold Yuan, the facts are like this, there is no need to avoid it, therefore, the government should promptly recognize the legal status of silver dollars, so that banks can develop silver dollar deposits and other things, and prices everywhere can directly use silver dollars as a unit, to avoid the continued disruption of general economic life by unstable currencies.

Recently, there has been much debate over the choice between the silver dollar standard and the Gold Yuan standard, the focus of the problem is no longer whether the silver standard is outdated, but the issue of local and central issuance rights, and the status of the Gold Yuan, this fact is very obvious, such as the past brewing of local authorities in Changsha, Hankou, and other places to issue silver dollar vouchers, the half-value silver dollar auxiliary currency vouchers issued by Yunnan Fudian New Bank, and the silver dollars cast and circulated by the Gansu Mint, although the motions in Changsha and Hankou have not become a reality, the measures in Yunnan and Gansu, after all, the government also has to acquiesce to in fact.

Regarding the suggestions for local authorities to issue local currency everywhere, it is still going on, not only has the Guangxi Provincial Assembly been doing its best to urge the local authorities to issue silver dollar vouchers, but at the same time, the Chongqing Provincial Assembly has even advocated that the five provinces and cities of Sichuan, Kang, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Chongqing jointly issue silver dollar vouchers for the southwest region, and use them directly within the region, that is, the provincial and municipal governments and public and private banks of the region invest in the establishment of a joint reserve, set aside enough funds, to prepare for the preparation of cash, so that the economy of the five provinces and cities, can not be constrained by the turmoil of the overall situation; in addition, the speaker of this city's provincial assembly, Pan Gongzhan, and the representative of the city's chamber of commerce, Yan Esheng, recently suggested at a reception by the city government that commercial banks and enterprises store enough reserves to issue local vouchers, and it is heard that they have obtained the support of acting Mayor Chen on the spot. All of these are the forerunners of forming regional economic barriers, although the government is determined to maintain the Gold Yuan system under this situation, but due to the deterioration of the current economic situation, "the situation is stronger than the people", how can it oppose the proposal for local authorities to issue silver dollar vouchers?

Due to the clamor for local authorities to issue silver dollar vouchers, people with knowledge of the situation are deeply afraid that the rise of regional economies will evolve into a situation of economic separation and division, so they mostly advocate that the government should issue silver dollar vouchers as soon as possible, on the one hand, it is because the Gold Yuan itself is on the verge of collapse, it is better to reform as soon as possible to save the economic disaster, on the other hand, it is to adapt to the times and avoid further turbulence in the vortex, this part of the opinion can be represented by legislator Qiu Hanping and others, and they have repeatedly proposed extensive discussions in the Legislative Yuan.

At the same time, it is heard that when Wang Zishuang, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, previously attended the Financial and Economic Review Committee of the Legislative Yuan, he brought the bank's proposed method for issuing silver dollar vouchers, and it is also heard that the method has been supported by the Financial and Economic Review Committee, and once the legislative process is completed, it can be seen in practice, and the estimated time is not too far; and another rumor is that the authorities are preparing to issue silver dollar vouchers, and whether to adopt a cash system in the future has not yet been decided, we combine the reports from all sides, it is clear that the issuance of silver dollar vouchers is already imminent.

Talking about issuing silver dollar vouchers, in fact, it is not a simple matter: First, there must be sufficient reserves. Second, it must be absolutely separated from public finance, and must not be allowed to be taken at will. Third, it must maintain an unlimited cash system to consolidate credit. Fourth, the issuance must be presided over by a financial institution in a transcendent position outside the Central Bank, so that the people's attitude of doubt can be changed. Fifth, the branch institutions of the issuing institution must be spread all over the country, so that the silver dollar vouchers can be widely circulated. Sixth, the value of the currency must be absolutely stable, and maintain a balanced relationship with gold, foreign exchange, and general prices. If one of these factors is missing, then the silver dollar voucher itself cannot be sound, and it will only add another tool to disturb the people.

In fact, we believe that the chaotic situation of public finance and finance today cannot be completely attributed to the monetary system itself, just like the previous legal currency and today's Gold Yuan, both belong to the category of managed currency, non-cash paper money, in monetary theory can not be said to be an outdated system, but the fundamental reason for their failure, is still on the political major premise; because now the right to issue Gold Yuan is completely in the hands of the government, so if the war does not stop for a day, and public finance cannot be balanced for a day, then the demand for Gold Yuan will not be satisfied for a day. We still remember the grand scene of the Gold Yuan reform, if the authorities could continue to control the issuance at that time, how could there be today's tragic situation! Therefore, we believe that before issuing silver dollar vouchers, if we do not recognize several major principles clearly, then the lessons of the legal currency and the Gold Yuan are still before our eyes, otherwise, I am afraid that we will fall into the fate of "the present looks at the past, and the future looks at the present", can we not consider the major events of currency policy thoroughly in advance?

In recent decades, the people have experienced many great storms in the sea of suffering, and have also experienced many currency system changes, so every time people talk about currency system reform, they all turn pale at the mention of it, especially today, when the Gold Yuan reform is not long ago, it is really an extremely difficult thing to talk about currency system reform again, so we advocate that this silver dollar voucher reform must adopt a full cash system, although there will inevitably be a psychology of cherishing it when the silver dollar flows out, but under today's situation, this is the only way to regain the people's hearts, this point is the key to the success or failure of the new currency system, and must not be relaxed. As for the institution presiding over the issuance, it must be a transcendent financial institution outside the Central Bank in order to refresh people's eyes and ears, and not be constrained by public finance, and obtain the belief and support of the people throughout the country.

In the initial stage of issuing silver dollar vouchers, the Gold Yuan circulating as an auxiliary currency can only be regarded as a temporary expedient, and the unstable ratio between it and the silver dollar voucher is also a difficulty, but the unit of the silver dollar seems to be too large in the current stage, and it is very inconvenient for the people to use it, so silver dollar auxiliary currencies must be prepared at the same time to avoid the difficulties when the Gold Yuan was first issued, as for the sake of adapting the purchasing power of currencies in various provinces to natural levels, the names of the provinces can also be stamped on them, but there is no difference in the area of circulation.

The institution that issues silver dollar vouchers, in principle, should organize a joint reserve with the national commercial bank organizations to enrich the reserves and increase credit, but in fact, there are inevitably some difficulties, such as the unsoundness of most commercial banks, and there is no doubt whether they themselves can gain the belief of the people? Moreover, the branch institutions of commercial banks are limited, and they cannot assume the task of regulating the finances of the whole country, and at the same time, there are many gangs in commercial banks, with unequal wisdom, and once there is a financial storm and a shake-up, I am afraid that it will delay the major events of currency policy, this is especially a place that cannot be ignored.

Secondly, we examine from all aspects the most suitable financial institutions to issue silver dollar vouchers at present, I am afraid that we should promote the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, the reasons why we want to choose this way are nothing more than the following points: (1) Both the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have a long history of more than 40 years, and they are more deeply imprinted in the general impression. (2) Both the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have branch institutions all over the country and abroad, which is very convenient for the cashing of silver dollar vouchers. (3) The capital of both the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications is second only to the Central Bank, and exceeds that of general commercial banks and enterprises, and the strength cannot be said to be not strong. (4) Although there are official shares in both the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, they are actually private banks under official supervision, and can be free from the influence of public finance, and are in a transcendent position. (5) During the Peking government era, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications did their best to maintain cash, and therefore the people's belief in them was very strong, just like when there was a run on the Central Bank around the 20th year of the Republic of China, not only were the two banks not affected, but they were able to help the Central Bank quell the turmoil, which can be seen from this. The current situation is quite similar to the past, so from an objective point of view, it is advisable for the two banks to preside over the issuance of silver dollar vouchers, it is not without reason.

However, since the unified issuance, the bullion and silver dollars and foreign exchange of both the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have been transferred to the Central Bank, and what the two banks currently control is actually still the Gold Yuan, if the silver dollar vouchers are handed over to the two banks for issuance, it will be very difficult to raise reserves, therefore, the Central Bank should return all the previously deposited bullion and silver dollars and foreign exchange to the two banks as a preparation for cash, in order to maintain cash, consolidate credit, but when the two banks preside over the issuance, representatives should be elected by the local public opinion institutions across the country to organize the Silver Dollar Voucher Issuance Supervisory Committee, check the number of issuances and the use of funds at any time, and issue announcements, in order to show great faith to the world, so that no matter how the future development of the overall situation is, the people will be able to avoid the poll tax-like inflation.

In fact, if the right to issue silver dollar vouchers can be completely handed over to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, and the issuance is supervised by representatives of public opinion, it is indeed the most ideal and practical measure at present, and it is also a way for the people to maintain their own way of life, and at the same time, because of the transcendent position of the two banks, the subsequent issuance can be free from the burden of the national treasury, and will not cause the brewing of local currency, forming a sick state of each governing its own, which is more or less a great economic achievement in the turbulent period.

Furthermore, because the silver dollar voucher itself has sufficient preparation and unlimited cash, the value of the currency is absolutely stable, all transactions can return to normal, and gold prices, prices, and exchange rates can all maintain a balanced relationship, and as long as the silver dollar voucher maintains an indefinite ratio with the Gold Yuan, it still does not hinder the circulation of the Gold Yuan, moreover, after the use of silver dollar vouchers, silver dollar deposits will inevitably increase, which will undoubtedly increase the strength of the banks and enterprises and crack down on the activities of speculative hoarders, from this, we can also save finance, curb prices, and stabilize people's lives.

### The Clouds of Doubt Between East and West Gradually Dissipate; The Four Foreign Ministers Meeting Opens Its Doors; The U.S. Issues a Statement Explaining Future Negotiation Focus with the Soviet Union; Britain Firmly Believes a Meeting Will Be Held Before July

[Report from Our Newspaper] London, 27th Broadcast: British officials say: If the Soviet Union's proposal to lift the Berlin Blockade does not come with unacceptable conditions, then a Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference may be convened before July 1st. It is understood that the British government supports convening a Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the German problem, but only on the premise that the Soviet Union does not propose unacceptable conditions. It does not intend to continue discussing this issue. Since then, Western countries have continued to seek any point that could indicate a change in the Soviet government's attitude and have strived to explore the possibility of contacting Soviet officials. When Stalin answered questions from American reporters on January 30, 1949, he did not mention the Berlin currency issue. This point attracted much attention from the State Department, as it indicated that the issue could be explored. Therefore, the acting representative of the United States to the Security Council at the time, Jessup, met with the Soviet representative Malik on February 15 to inquire whether Stalin's silence on the currency issue had any special meaning. More than a month later, on March 15, Malik informed Jessup that Stalin's failure to mention the currency issue was not "accidental." Although the Soviet government considered this an important issue, it felt that if a foreign ministers conference could be convened to discuss the entire German issue, this matter could be discussed at the foreign ministers conference. Jessup asked if this meant that the Soviet government was prepared to hold a foreign ministers conference while continuing the blockade of Berlin, or whether it would lift the blockade first. The U.S. government had informed the British and French governments of the Soviet government's attitude in these informal negotiations. On March 21, Malik invited Jessup and said that if a date could be set for the convening of a foreign ministers conference, the Soviet side would lift the Berlin Blockade and restrictions on trade as an exchange condition, and would lift the blockade before the conference began. Taking advantage of the presence of the British and French foreign ministers in the United States, the State Department immediately discussed the latest developments in the Soviet attitude with them and reached a unanimous opinion. On April 5, Jessup read the statement drafted by the three countries to Malik to avoid any misunderstanding by the Soviet Union. The purpose of this statement was to clarify the focus of discussion as:

(1) The Soviet Union lifts all restrictions on transportation and trade between Berlin and West Germany that it has implemented since March 1, 1948, and the three Western countries simultaneously lift all restrictions on transportation and trade with East Germany.

(2) Confirm the date for holding the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference.

The Western countries wanted to be sure that the Soviet Union would no longer include these two points as reasons for refusing to lift the Berlin Blockade. The statement also summarized the three countries' understanding of the Soviet Union's attitude towards lifting the blockade and convening a foreign ministers conference. The purpose of this was to ensure that the Soviet government's position was the same as that published by TASS. On April 10, Malik again invited Jessup to reiterate the Soviet government's position. Judging from the statement issued by Malik, there were still several points that needed clarification.

### The Three Powers Establish a New Organization in West Germany

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] After the implementation of the constitution agreed upon by the three powers' governors and West German leaders on the 25th, the Allied High Commission will be the highest body of Allied control over West Germany. This agreement was signed by the three foreign ministers, Bevin, Acheson, and Schuman, here on April 8. The agreement also stipulates that even before the occupation regulations come into effect, that is, after the merger of the British, American, and French occupation zones, the powers of the High Commission will be in accordance with the occupation regulations and international agreements. In addition, the three powers also announced an agreement stipulating that the plebiscite in the state of Württemberg-Baden will be postponed to avoid hindering the establishment of the German Federation. Regarding France's participation in the Kiel port on the Rhine River, the three powers also agreed that France will continue to maintain control over the port until the establishment of the German federal government and the completion of administrative negotiations on the port.

### Jessup and Malik are Holding Secret Meetings; Rumors that Soviet Troops in Berlin are Ready to Lift the Blockade

[Report from Our Newspaper] New York, 27th Broadcast: U.S. Ambassador Jessup met with Soviet Ambassador to the United Nations Malik at 12:30 pm on the 27th to discuss the lifting of the Berlin Blockade. Jessup told reporters that information on the talks to end the East-West Cold War will be released later at the American headquarters in Lake Success.

[United Press, Lake Success, 27th] The United States and the Soviet Union plan to hold a secret meeting on the 27th to discuss ending the Berlin Blockade. U.S. Representative to the United Nations Jessup will meet with Soviet Representative Malik in New York (possibly at Malik's office in Manhattan) to find a way to lift the Berlin Blockade and discuss plans for a Four-Power Conference on Germany.

After consulting with President Truman, the State Department announced: "There is considerable hope for ending the Berlin Blockade and convening a Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference." Although, if the Berlin Blockade is lifted, the Cold War between East and West will be greatly eased, Secretary of State Acheson is still urging the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to promptly ratify the Atlantic Treaty. Although the Jessup-Malik meeting will be held in secret, its results are expected to be announced later by Jessup and the U.S. delegation here.

[Reuters, Berlin, 26th] Germans close to senior Soviet officials in Berlin revealed that Soviet officials are confident that the blockade of Berlin and the Allied counter-blockade will soon be lifted. Soviet military headquarters has just received orders from Moscow instructing them to immediately begin all technical preparations for lifting the blockade.

[Reuters, London, 27th] Western observers in Berlin believe that the Soviet Union is engaged in a final attempt to delay the establishment of West Germany. A British Foreign Office spokesman said: The contacts between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the German issue announced by TASS are exploratory in nature and are still ongoing. The reports by TASS, although not detailed, are accurate. The British government is maintaining contact with the U.S. and French governments on this matter.

### Developments in the Chinese Situation Will Threaten Korea; Syngman Rhee Will Request the U.S. to Temporarily Suspend the Withdrawal of Troops

According to sources close to the South Korean government, the current drastic changes in the Chinese situation will prompt the Syngman Rhee government to ask the United States to reconsider its planned withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in South Korea in the coming months.

### After Announcing its Independence as a Republic, India Agrees to Join the British Commonwealth; India Will Continue to Recognize the British Monarch as Head of the Commonwealth

[Reuters, London, 27th] British King George VI met with eight Commonwealth prime ministers at Buckingham Palace today to hear the new formula for India's participation in the Commonwealth. The formula stipulates that after India declares itself a republic on August 15, the British monarch will continue to be the supreme citizen of the Republic of India.

It is generally recognized that this is a major victory for Britain and the Commonwealth. Diplomatic figures believe that India's agreement to continue to participate in the British Commonwealth under the British monarch is the result of the Labour Party's enlightened policies. If the Conservative Party had been in power, India would have completely broken away from the British Commonwealth, and once this precedent was set, Burma and Ireland, which have already completely broken away from the Commonwealth, could also rejoin the Commonwealth without compromising their republican status.

[Reuters, London, 27th] A new page has been written in the history of the British Commonwealth today. India has agreed to continue as a member of the British Commonwealth while declaring itself an independent republic. India has also recognized the British monarch as the head of the Commonwealth, so when the President of India is sworn in, he will still make a broad statement of allegiance to the British monarch and the Commonwealth.

### Silver Dollar Rises Endlessly; Gold and Silver Exchange Trading is Doubled

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, silver dollars on the road became the darling of the day, and gold and US dollars were overshadowed. Due to the need for contingency measures everywhere, the demand was urgent. In addition, the Central Bank's 50,000 and 100,000 large notes were released in large quantities, and the money supply was loose and excessive. Wandering funds had no way out, and transactions were chaotic. There was demand but no supply, and the market showed a buying spree. Prices changed rapidly and fluctuated sharply.

In the morning, Big Heads were offered at 900,000 and 1 million, and rose to 1.1 million and 1.2 million near noon. In the afternoon, the buying momentum soared, and reached as high as 1.4 million and 1.5 million in the evening. Small Heads were offered at 1 million and 1.1 million, and Eagle Dragons were offered at 700,000 and 800,000. Bank draft transactions were quoted without any standards. Big Heads were initially traded at 1.3 million and 1.5 million, but in the afternoon, they actually hit the 2 million mark, rising to 2 million and 2.2 million, about doubling compared to the previous day.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The gold and silver exchange trading in the Stock Exchange Building is doubled. Because some securities firms have low business volume, they have switched to trading gold for silver and silver for gold. The sound of clanging is filling the ears. Big Heads started at 33 and 36, all the way down to 29 and 32, and in the afternoon, they were as low as 28 and 31.

### Gold Quotations are Chaotic

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday's gold market situation was still very chaotic, with little trading. In the morning, because the other party sold gold and bought silver, and the number of chips increased, bank draft transactions had more supply than demand. Quotations fell from 4,200 and 4,700 all the way down to 3,500 and 4,000. Near noon, because the money supply was loose, the banks helped with all their strength to absorb, and prices rose to 4,500 and 5,000.

US dollar transactions have no standards. The market quotations are only between 670,000. In the exchange method, a Big Head of 6 yuan exchanges for 10 US dollars, and there are also transactions. The final market quotation is 900,000 to buy and 1 million to sell, all settled with Japanese bank drafts.

Yesterday, the jewelry stores still did not resume price posting. Although the jewelry stores in this city are open as usual, the transaction is still stalled. The exchange of new and old is also sluggish, with a loss of 600,000 per tael.

### Cotton Yarn Still Not Trading Actively

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market still did not see active trading, mainly because wholesale merchants in this area found direct sales to be quite sluggish, so their interest was minimal. As for buyers in South China, most are directly exchanging gold with factories.

Transactions in the cloth market are still not expanding significantly. Both industry insiders and customer groups are cautious. Only three transactions took place throughout the day, and high prices were on the rise.

"Dragon Head" fine cloth retreated from 3.95 million to 3.7 million, but recovered to 4.15 million at midday, ultimately rising by 1.05 million compared to the previous day. "Five Blessings" fine cloth was quoted actively from 2.8 million to 3 million, but no transactions were seen afterward. "Four Gentlemen" serge initially stood at the 4 million mark in the morning, suddenly plunged to 3.5 million midway, and finally rose to 4.2 million at the close, continuing to rise by 1.1 million. Trading was uniformly lackluster for all other fabrics.

### Shanghai Stock Market Quiet

Investor sentiment in the stock market was disheartened, and the trend was stagnant. Inside the market, only popular stocks saw a few closing transactions. Minor stocks had no price quotations at all, and the market trend was weak. Yung Shing Cotton Mill opened low at 250 yuan in the morning, and operators rushed to close positions, even down to 200 yuan. Off-market short covering occurred on small declines, rebounding to close at 255 yuan. Sin Kwong, because it stood firm against widespread weakness the day before, continued to be supported by backers yesterday. It opened in the morning and was immediately pushed up to 11.20 yuan, reaching the limit increase. Amidst the sharp fall of Yung Shing Cotton Mill and generally soft market conditions, it fell to 10 yuan, finally closing at 10.05 yuan, still a gain from the previous day's squeeze. King Fook, Wing Fung, and National Goods all closed at the limit increase. Mayar Silk Mill continued to soften, opening at 5.80 yuan in the morning and falling to close at 5 yuan. China Pottery opened initially at 4.30 yuan and held its original price at midday, while all others saw no trading.
