### President Convenes Important Officials to Study the CCP's Situation Statement and Decides to Continue Listening to the People's Opinions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Capital officials continue to remain silent regarding the attitude towards Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation broadcasted by the CCP radio station. Officials learned the full text of the statement on the afternoon of the 15th. Several important officials, such as Vice President Li, Premier of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan Tong Guanxian, Political Committee members Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Qun, as well as Shao Lizi, Chen Lifu, Wu Tiecheng, etc., were successively summoned by the President to conduct research at the official residence and discuss with the President the main points of the statement and the attitude to be taken, providing opinions respectively. According to what our reporter has learned, they have a generally similar view, that is, they believe that the door to peace has already been opened, and the President has decided to continue listening to the people's opinions, and will invite representatives from the Min. Qing two parties, as well as people from all walks of life in the Kuomintang and representatives from local public opinion institutions within one or two days to talk. After extensively soliciting opinions from all parties, a final decision will be made. The political reactions in the capital on the 15th were remarkably calm.

[Our City News] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party, accepted an invitation from the authorities and traveled to the capital by car on the evening of the 15th, related to promoting peace talks.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] After Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation was released, very few government officials commented on it. When our reporter visited Shao Lizi, he first expressed that this statement should be regarded as the door to peace having already been opened, because the eight conditions mentioned in this statement were aimed at the principles of the President's New Year's Day message, and the target of the peace talks it referred to was still the current government. Shao's expression during the conversation was more optimistic than before, believing that there was hope for the future.

[Gao Erya, Chief of the United Press China Branch, Nanjing, 15th] Senior officials welcomed the CCP's counter-proposal for peace talks, but they were very cautious in interpreting the CCP's reply. A discussion meeting was held at the Presidential Palace on the morning of the 15th, attended by senior advisors, cabinet members, and party leaders, to study the full text of Mao Zedong's eight points. Political Committee member Zhang Qun made the following statement to the United Press, fully demonstrating the government's attention to Mao Zedong's reply: "The government is now sincerely striving to turn hostility into friendship. This reply is not only of great importance to the government, but also a serious test for world peace. If there is no peace in China, there can be no world peace." Every member of the government is prepared to study it in the most detailed way. In fact, it has been scrutinized word by word, sentence by sentence. It is too early to make a hasty decision and announce the conclusion now. "It is not yet possible to predict when the government will make a decision, nor can the content of the decision be known."

Sun Ke himself has been immersed in studying the CCP's counter-proposals. Well-informed sources said that the first decision the government should make is to determine which parts of Mao's declaration are in principle consistent with peace and progress. Sun should also determine which parts have the possibility of a consistent position, which parts echo his glorious peace and no-surrender purpose, and which parts must be immediately rejected.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The secret plenary session of the Control Yuan convened for the peace issue was held on the morning of the 15th. Chairman Yu Youren, in addition to the Peace Group of the Yuan reporting on recent contacts with Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, etc., also discussed the eight conditions proposed in Mao Zedong's statement on the current situation. Subsequently, some people advocated that all members of the Control Yuan should pay respects to the President to hear the President's intentions on peace. It was then resolved to request the Peace Group to continue its efforts, and after the group visits the President within one or two days, it will be submitted to the Yuan's meeting for discussion on concrete measures.

### The Beijing Municipal Assembly Issues a Declaration Calling for Peace, Suggesting the Formation of a National Peace and Reform Promotion Association to Discuss the Conditions Proposed by Both Sides

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] In the declaration calling for peace passed by the Beijing Municipal Assembly on the 15th, it was advocated that the President's five principles and the Communist Party's eight principles should be submitted to the peace talks for discussion and decision, and according to the contents of the declaration, Speaker Zeng and the Vice Speaker should maintain contact with various parts of the country. The declaration stated: Today, nothing is more urgent than peace, and nothing is more important than reform. Peace is the prerequisite for reform, and reform is the guarantee of peace. We demand that the government and the Communist Party's troops immediately cease fire on the spot, and then both sides quickly send representatives, together with representatives from various parties, representatives from public opinion institutions in various provinces and cities, and representatives from people's organizations, to hold a new political consultation meeting to resolve national affairs. The five principles proposed in the President's New Year's Day message and the eight conditions recently proposed by the Communist Party are indeed far apart, but from the people's perspective, peace talks are by no means a matter of who eliminates whom, but how to end the war and how to solve the people's problems. Everything should be based on the interests of the people and should be guided by the will of the people. All constitutional issues, legal issues, and the issues of the advancement and retreat of anyone can be easily resolved through consultation. This is the style that statesmen should have. We believe that provinces and cities should be given full autonomy, and the army should be reorganized into a strong national defense force under reasonable conditions, and a detached command system should be established. This is the step that should be taken to promote peace.

Regarding reform, we demand that the government recognize corruption, eradicate the powerful families, suppress the powerful and privileged, equalize the wealth of the people, reform land administration, eradicate bureaucratic capitalism, and thoroughly implement the Principle of People's Livelihood. We demand that the Communist Party abandon the terrifying policies of "struggle" and "liquidation." Although the methods of communism and the Principle of People's Livelihood are not entirely the same, the goals are originally the same. The true will of the people is to demand to live, to demand to live under a normal and beautiful cultural tradition. The people need a social revolution, a bloodless social revolution. Democratic politics cannot be separated from the category of party politics. Political parties should compete in the parliament, not in the battlefield. Whoever wins the hearts of the people will gain leadership. The current problem is to preserve the lives of the people and give them the opportunity to choose freely.

The current time is urgent and fleeting. This peace and reform movement should be launched immediately. We hope that the provincial and municipal assemblies (including the provincial-level public opinion institutions in the Communist Party areas) and national people's organizations (including the national people's organizations in the Communist Party areas) will immediately send one to three representatives to gather in Shanghai within this month to prepare for the establishment of a national peace and reform promotion conference, and the representatives of the first ten units to report will be responsible for preparing and carrying out all the preparatory work.

[Another Telegram] The Municipal Assembly, at its ninth temporary meeting on the 15th, discussed the proposal of the Shanghai and Hubei Provincial Assemblies to establish a national peace promotion association, passed a declaration calling for peace, and decided on the steps to establish the peace promotion association: (1) Request the Speaker and Vice Speaker to be representatives of the Municipal Assembly; (2) Send a telegram to the national (including Communist Party areas) public opinion institutions in various provinces and cities and national people's organizations, and ask them to send representatives to Shanghai by a set date; (3) Immediately invite people from all walks of life in the city and national people's organizations to exchange views, and ask national people's organizations to send representatives to Shanghai to prepare together; (4) Set a date to go to Shanghai before the 25th of this month, and entertain people from all walks of life in Shanghai and Chinese and foreign journalists; (5) Immediately translate it into English and broadcast it to the world to win international public opinion's sympathy and promotion; (6) Discuss borrowing the Shanghai Municipal Assembly as the address of the National Peace and Reform Promotion Association, and immediately discuss establishing a representative registration office within the assembly's address.

[Central News Agency, Xiamen, 15th] The People's Congresses of Xiamen City and the Siming, Kaiyuan, Gulang, Xiamen Port, and Heshan districts recently sent a telegram to the whole country, expressing their support for the President's New Year's Day message, and stating: Regardless of peace or war, national independence must be complete, the sacred Constitution must be respected, the territory of the Republic of China must be ensured, and the Chinese legal system cannot be abolished.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 14th] The Hunan Provincial Assembly today invited local elders and national representatives, members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan from Hunan to hold a symposium to discuss the organization of the Hunan Provincial Peace Promotion Association. After the meeting, Qiu Ao, Zhang Jiong, Peng Guojun, Cao Dianqiu, Tang Boqiu, and other twenty-three people were selected as preparatory committee members, and a formal establishment was scheduled.

### "Blueprint for Red China"

The San Francisco Chronicle comments on Mao Zedong's statement

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 14th] The San Francisco Chronicle here today published an article commenting on Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions, stating that even if Stalin himself were to write it, he would never draft more cruel and more communist-style conditions. It continued, stating that those who are still obsessed with believing that reconciliation is possible between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party or between communist and non-communist countries should repeatedly study these conditions. The title of the newspaper's editorial was "Blueprint for Red China." It said that these conditions are enough to overturn the arguments of some pro-Communist individuals, who have claimed that the Chinese Communists are not real communists, but merely progressive and well-intentioned Chinese people whose only wish is to improve the status of the general population of China. The article then commented on Mao Zedong's eight conditions one by one.

[Another Telegram] The San Francisco News editorial today stated that in light of all the official hesitation and "frank differences" expressed regarding the issue of aid to China, the US government should at least do one thing now, which is to issue a formal statement clearly stating that the United States will not fund or support a communist government in China.

### The Capital's Diplomatic Community Remains Silent, Paying Close Attention to Mao Zedong's Statement, Our Reply to the Four-Power Mediation is Still Pending

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The capital's diplomatic community learned on the 15th that CCP leader Mao Zedong had issued a statement on the current situation, putting forward conditions for peace. Although they continued to remain silent, believing that this was an internal Chinese matter and refusing to discuss it, they were clearly paying attention to the CCP's move. Ambassador Roshchen remained ill at his private residence, and Ambassadors Stuart, Steben, and Murry lacked activity. There were also no contacts within our Ministry of Foreign Affairs throughout the day, and we are still waiting for the four countries to respond to the memorandum submitted by our country. According to observations by relevant parties, the CCP's formal response to the President's New Year's Day message will help the four countries consider the government's memorandum. However, whether or not international mediation will ultimately become a reality depends on the development of the peace negotiations between the government and the CCP.

[Our Newspaper] Washington, 15th Broadcast: US State Department spokesman McDermott refused to comment on the London report that the US and Britain declined to mediate the Kuomintang-Communist peace talks in China.

[United Press, Nanjing, 15th] The Chinese government's request for the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to mediate has not received a satisfactory response. According to reliable sources, although the United States has submitted a reply, it has not agreed to act as a mediator. Britain and France are expected to adopt the same attitude. The Soviet Union may come forward to mediate, but in the current situation, it can only salvage it slightly.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] According to a reporter from the Nanjing Central Daily News on the 14th, it was learned from the capital's diplomatic community that the US State Department has strictly ordered the US Embassy in Beijing to stay absolutely out of the peace movement currently underway in China. Unless the Chinese side comes to contact, US diplomats should not have any formal contact with Chinese people. US diplomatic officials in China have also been ordered not to make any statements or engage in any work to influence the development of the situation in China.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] After receiving the Chinese government's request for mediation in the civil war, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France all remained silent, while the Soviet Union openly expressed its opposition. The Kremlin especially wants to allow the Chinese Communist Party to act freely, so that they can gain full benefits from the current situation without any restrictions. However, if the Western three powers have not expressed sincerity in the task of mediation, it cannot be assumed that they do not want to see the Chinese civil war end as soon as possible. It is still remembered that although General Marshall was highly regarded, and at a time when the balance of military power between the two sides was relatively easy to achieve a peaceful resolution in 1946, his efforts to mediate still failed. Therefore, it will be even more difficult to succeed today.

### Jiangxi Discusses Contingency Plans, Hu Jiafeng Expresses That Peace is Only Possible After Being Able to Fight

[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 15th] Jiangxi Chairman Hu Jiafeng learned of the CCP's reply of eight points from the newspaper on the morning of the 15th and summoned the heads of various agencies in the provincial capital to hold a symposium. He immediately expressed his opinion on the CCP's reply, stating that Jiangxi today should be able to defend before it can fight, and can fight before it can make peace. Strengthening unity is the only way to exert strength, and being able to exert strength is the only way to save the nation. At the symposium, Jiangxi's contingency plans were also discussed, including strengthening defense, organizing and training the people, sending talents to the countryside, establishing a deputy county head in each county, and improving major policies such as conscription and grain requisition.

[Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 15th] After the CCP's statement was released, reporters visited Jiangxi Provincial Assembly Speaker Wang Zhenxin and revolutionary elder Peng Chengwan on the 15th. They both believed that the future of peace was quite bleak. However, since the CCP was able to openly respond to the people's call, they still hoped to take the future of the country and the lives of the people as the premise to break the deadlock of peace.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 15th] After the CCP's peace conditions were released, local officials remained silent. Local gentry such as Geng Boxiao and Ai Yuying said that it was better to have a reply than no reply, but they all expressed dissatisfaction with the clauses on punishing war criminals, and planned to send many representatives to the capital to state their opinions.

### The Railway Passenger and Freight Fare Increase Case, the Political Affairs Council Decides to Retain It, Pushing Xu Kan and Others to Study Fundamental Adjustment Methods First

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] The case of adjusting railway passenger and freight fares by five times has been discussed at the Political Affairs Council meeting on the 15th, and it was decided to retain it. The case was submitted together with the postal and telecommunications price increase. After discussion, some Political Committee members believed that at a time when prices are soaring, although the adjustment of prices in the transportation industry has always followed prices, prices are often stimulated to rise by the increase in prices in the transportation industry. Therefore, it is believed that future price adjustments must be carefully studied and fundamental measures must be taken to ensure that they do not lead prices, or adjust in comparison with the cost of living index. It was decided to push Xu Kan, Liu Weichi, Yu Dawei, Pang Songzhou, and others to study it first, and then submit it for discussion.

### The National Army Has Absolute Superiority in Strength, Guanzhong is as Solid as a Rock, Hu Zongnan Still Sits in Xi'an to Preside Over Major Plans

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 15th] Due to the establishment of the Hanzhong Command Post of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters and the visit of Ma Hongkui's representative to the military and political leaders here, the speculation of the general sensitive people on the situation in Guanzhong has been affected, and rumors have been rampant in recent weeks. Our reporter recently learned from relevant parties that the Northwest battlefield is still dominated by Guanzhong and supplemented by Southern Shaanxi. In the comparison of strength between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in Guanzhong, the National Army still has an absolute advantage. The highest estimate of the combat effectiveness of Peng's bandit remnants is no more than three columns, and the National Army is several times larger than them. The establishment of the command post in Southern Shaanxi is based on military needs. After the Lan Wanxi bandit army went south to northwestern Hubei, the National Army should strengthen the defense of Southern Shaanxi to ensure that Guanzhong has no worries and can fully attack Peng's bandits. Luo Shining, Ma Hongkui's representative, also stated here that the 100,000 iron riders of the Ningxia Corps, in addition to being stationed, also guarded the three borders and protected Baosui. At the moment, they are unable to leave the country due to equipment problems. It is generally believed that if there are no major changes in the overall situation, General Hu Zongnan will still sit in Xi'an and preside over the major plans in the Northwest.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 15th] The Shaanxi Security Command announced a battle report, our Zhen'an team recovered Maoping on the morning of the 11th.

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 15th] The Tibetan leaders from southern Gansu who came to visit Director Hu Zongnan today expressed their views on the current situation to reporters, stating that the Tibetans in the Zhuoni area take the President's will as their will and are willing to be dispatched to contribute to the struggle for peace.

### US Consul in Tianjin Telegraphed Washington to Report Damage to the Consulate

### Tianjin War Comes to a Temporary End; Communist Forces Announce Occupation of the Entire City via Broadcast

[United Press International, San Francisco, 15th] A Shaanxi Communist radio broadcast today claimed that after a 27 and a half hour assault on Tianjin, the Communist forces "completely liberated" the area at 1:30 PM today. The garrison was completely annihilated and the commander of the garrison, Chen Changjie, was captured.

[Associated Press, Peiping, 15th] According to official news received here, Communist forces have entered Tianjin. By early morning of the 15th, the Communist forces only encountered very weak resistance. Sparse gunfire was still heard in the eastern suburbs of Tianjin, but the main offensive and defensive battle for Tianjin has already ended. The situation in Tanggu near Tianjin is unclear, but it is generally believed to be similar to Tianjin.

[Associated Press, Local Dispatch] US Consul General in Tianjin, Smith, wired that Communist forces entered the Tianjin city area and the former British and French concessions on the morning of the 15th. This means that the Communist forces have effectively taken control of the entire city, ending a month-long siege. At 10:46 AM on the 15th, Smith radioed Shanghai: "Five or six Communist soldiers are now passing by the US Consulate, firing rifles into the sky." Sixteen minutes prior, Smith wired: "According to a report from the US Information Service, Communist forces are now in front of the US Information Service office. Communists are shouting at Nationalist soldiers sheltering in the fire station to throw their weapons into the street." The US Information Service is only three blocks from the Consulate.

[Additional News] According to a telegram from the US Consulate in Tianjin on the afternoon of the 15th, the Tianjin battle has almost completely ceased. This indicates that Tianjin has completely fallen. Communist officials have not yet made contact with the US Consulate, but it is indirectly learned that a Communist soldier told an American expatriate that the Communist forces will protect foreigners.

[Associated Press, Local Dispatch] It is learned here that after the Tianjin garrison refused to surrender unconditionally, the Communist forces launched an attack on the 14th, continuously advancing into the city with artillery and infantry. Lin Biao's troops first crossed the Hai River from the north and entered the old city, passed through the Nationalist army and advanced rapidly southward into the former French, British, and American concessions. By 10:30 AM on the 15th, Communist forces were parading on the streets near the French, British, and American consulates, firing into the sky, demanding that Nationalist soldiers lay down their weapons and come out of their shelters.

As of the time of this dispatch in the afternoon, the battle was still raging.

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 15th] The North China Suppression Headquarters announced: There was continued fighting in the suburbs of Peiping today.

### Spokesperson of the North China Suppression Headquarters Discusses Situation: Street Fighting Still Occurring in Tianjin City Area; Nationalist Army Only Engaged in Self-Defense, Continues to Seek Peace

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 15th] When a reporter inquired about the Tianjin situation with the spokesperson of the Suppression Headquarters, the spokesperson replied: Tianjin is the economic and industrial heart of North China. As the war approached the suburbs, it coincided with a time when the entire country was striving for peace. The Tianjin garrison, consisting of only one and a half regular army corps, was also maintaining order and ensuring security, hoping for the progress of peace. The government authorities, people from all walks of life, and all compatriots in the city have made their utmost efforts in various ways, hoping to negotiate a solution under the principles of peace, and to avoid the destruction of industry and commerce, and to prevent the loss of life and property of two million outstanding citizens. Although these efforts have not yet yielded concrete results, they are still continuing to seek peace. Unfortunately, during this period of peaceful progress, the fighting intensified from the 9th, and by the 13th, the city area was under full-scale attack, with artillery fire continuously pouring into the city center, causing fires everywhere. As of the morning of the 15th, street fighting was still occurring in several parts of the city. Even under these intense battle conditions, the Nationalist army was only engaged in self-defense, and has not abandoned a glimmer of hope for preserving industrial and commercial buildings and the lives and property of the people, and continues to seek peace.

Editorial

### The Preconditions for Peace Talks

The peace that the people of the entire country have been hoping for day and night has lasted for a full half-month since New Year's Day. Yesterday, everyone read Mao Zedong's broadcast speech on the 12th, and inevitably felt bewildered!

The President advocated peace, the people unanimously called for peace, and the Chinese Communists also said that "in order to quickly end the war and alleviate the suffering of the people, they are willing to hold peace talks." Logically, the door to peace should have been wide open, and peace should have been highly promising. However, the Chinese Communists put forward eight conditions as the basis for peace talks: (1) Punish war criminals, (2) Abolish the Constitution, (3) Abolish the legal system, (4) Reorganize the "reactionary" army, (5) Confiscate bureaucratic capital, (6) Reform the land system, (7) Abolish "traitorous" treaties, and (8) Convene a Political Consultative Conference without the participation of "reactionaries" to establish a "democratic coalition government." In this way, it seems that the Chinese Communists have not straightforwardly agreed to peace talks, and peace seems to be within sight but unattainable. We do not wish to discuss here whether the eight conditions are reasonable, but rather to study whether peace talks should have these preconditions.

The President said long ago that he only hopes that peace can be realized, and he will not be concerned with anything else. It can be seen that if peace talks can be reopened, it is only necessary to discuss the national political system and the welfare of the people. If the Chinese Communists truly put the people first, they should be able to meet each other with sincerity and discuss matters frankly, without having to put forward any preconditions. Moreover, even Shao Lizi, the elder statesman for peace, said that the eight conditions proposed by the Chinese Communists are rather harsh, which cannot but be considered regrettable. However, some people believe that the eight conditions of the Chinese Communists can be regarded as a counter-proposal to the five principles of peace in the President's New Year's Day message, and there is still room for negotiation. We naturally only hope that this is the case.

However, we believe that the most urgent matter today is to save the people from the abyss of suffering. The reason why we urgently need peace is to allow the people to have a day of rest and recuperation as soon as possible. The people want peace, the government wants peace, and if the Chinese Communists also truly want peace, we do not understand why peace has not yet come? The current dispute between the two sides may lie between these five principles or eight foundations. In fact, from the people's point of view, these matters are all within the scope of discussion after the start of peace talks, and are not necessarily required to be decided before peace talks. If both sides regard these conditions as preconditions for peace talks, and delay the matter by arguing back and forth, then every day that is delayed means another day of fighting, which means that the people suffer another day and the country loses another day. Therefore, the matter today is to make peace if you want peace, and there should be no so-called preconditions for peace talks.

Or perhaps someone thinks that how can peace be achieved if the preconditions are not discussed well? And who will mediate? Our view is that it depends on whether both sides are sincere. If either side is not sincere and cannot be tolerant, then there is no need to talk about peace. If both sides are sincere, they should trust each other and not suspect each other of being a "deception." Then peace can be achieved immediately. How to make peace? Broadcast to each other, send telegrams to each other, agree on a date and time, and at the same time, both sides issue orders for a ceasefire. Only this immediate ceasefire in place is the true precondition for peace talks that meets the wishes of the people!

If both sides issue an order to cease fire, the whole country will be free of the smell of gunpowder, and the people will surely be overjoyed. Then, under the supervision of representatives of local public opinion organizations and visiting groups of Chinese and foreign journalists, the troops of both sides will wait in place for the start and progress of peace talks. Then, the people will designate a location that is internationally visible, guarantee the safety of the representatives of both sides, and both sides will immediately send representatives to arrive and begin to discuss all the conditions and methods for the sake of the country and the people.

### Strive for True Peace, Unite to Protect Freedom: Chu Chia-hua Delivers Speech on the Current Situation

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 15th] Chu Chia-hua, President of the Academia Sinica, recently issued his views on the current situation, stating: "China is a peace-loving nation. The quest for peace is the common desire of all people. The government has always pursued peace as its traditional policy. The tolerance of the Communists in the past, the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communists during the War of Resistance against Japan, and the convening of the Political Consultative Conference after the victory all prove that we want to live in peace with the Communists and jointly work for the country. However, the Communists belong to the Communist International organization system and have their own outlook on life and the universe. They must use force as a tool for political struggle, destroy the existing social order, change the people's way of life, and deprive all people of their freedom in order to complete their mission as the international fifth column. The government's and the people's efforts for peace over the years have all failed because of this reason. Since the President's New Year's Day message was released, public opinion organizations across the country have responded. The commentary from Xinhua News Agency and the eight demands put forward by Mao Zedong fully reveal the true face of the Chinese Communists and further show their militarism and contempt for the interests of the country and the nation. Although the people are eager for peace and the government has reaffirmed its determination for peace, peace cannot be achieved unilaterally. The responsibility for war or peace is already clear to the world. The Chinese Communists, like the Communist parties in other countries around the world, are doing their best to carry out purges and struggles. All non-Communist people are regarded as enemies and are to be eliminated. The current so-called liberated areas and the fate of Eastern European countries after the 'Iron Curtain' are examples of this. Even if the Chinese Communists are like this, we still don't have to be disappointed. On the one hand, we should continue to work hard to urge them to come to their senses. On the other hand, we must each strive to improve ourselves, raise our vigilance, strengthen our determination, and all freedom-loving people should unite to work hard for reform, to defend the independence and autonomy of the country and the nation, to protect human rights and the democratic way of life, to maintain cultural and intellectual freedom, to unanimously identify our goals, and to strive for true peace with a spirit of perseverance and struggle."

### Security Council Continues Debate on Indonesian Question: Netherlands Again Refuses to Withdraw Troops, Believes Any UN Plan for Indonesia Is Superfluous, Rumor of Very Moderate New US Plan

[United Press, Lake Success, 14th] Dutch Representative Van Royen stated in the Security Council on the 14th, suggesting the holding of elections in Indonesia. He said, "This election, under the supervision of the United Nations," will form a provisional government. The Netherlands hopes to form a provisional government "within one month from today." Van Royen continued to insist that the Security Council had no right to interfere in "this internal affair," and announced that the Netherlands "will not comply with" the United Nations' order to withdraw Dutch troops. He rebuked US Representative Jessup's "most unfair and one-sided" accusation, and questioned whether the United States could find in the history of the United Nations an example of "such prompt compliance" with the Security Council's demands. He continued, any timetable from the United Nations "is superfluous in view of our own plans. Our own plans are being rapidly developed." Van Royen reiterated his previous refusal to comply with the order to withdraw troops.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 14th] The Security Council continued to discuss the Indonesian issue today. The United Nations may soon make a concrete decision on the issue, as behind-the-scenes activities have made progress. After informal discussions with the US delegation and the delegations of China, Canada, and Norway, a draft temporary plan has been prepared.

### US State Department Issues Statement Advocating Expansion of the Atlantic Alliance, Emphasizing US Military Aid Is Necessary

[United Press, Washington, 14th] The State Department insisted on the 14th that the Soviet Union has created much "terror and instability" in the world, making it necessary for free nations to unite and arm themselves for their mutual defense. In a frank 3,000-word policy statement, the State Department condemned the Soviet Union, stating that the United States must participate in the North Atlantic Security Alliance and supply Western European democracies with weapons, because "potential aggressors" have attempted to undermine the United Nations' efforts to achieve peace. The statement, which was distributed among the representatives of 250 private organizations meeting here to formulate a program to support human rights under the United Nations, is one of the most candid statements issued by the State Department. The statement named the Soviet Union, accusing it of obstructing the United Nations' efforts to establish world peace.

The State Department called for continued economic aid under the Marshall Plan. The statement said that the people of Western Europe cannot work for reconstruction and make sacrifices because they fear that their land will be conquered by foreign troops. Acting Secretary of State Lovett, in a speech to the delegation, explained the position of the United States. He denied that the United States had begun to "bypass" the United Nations. On the contrary, the United States is working to realize the principles of the United Nations by contacting other governments directly, thereby making the United Nations "more effective." US Representative to the UN Dulles told the meeting that countries outside the Soviet sphere of influence all hope that the United States will be strong to deter the communist threat, but he warned that the United States should not adopt a "militaristic" policy and abandon all efforts in one fell swoop. The State Department's statement also pointed out that the United States, Canada, and five Western European countries have been negotiating the North Atlantic Defense Treaty since July last year. The statement also called for the joint participation of all countries in the North Atlantic region. State Department spokesman McDermott also explicitly stated that if the above-mentioned countries intend to obtain US aid, they should join this alliance. The State Department's statement called for preventing the Soviet Union's post-war "obstructionism," stating that the blockade of Berlin is a masterpiece of Soviet action, sufficient to endanger peace. The State Department did not predict when the North Atlantic Treaty negotiations could be completed, only stating: "Both sides of the Atlantic are racking their brains to study practical steps." Diplomatic circles speculate that the treaty will likely be submitted to the Senate for approval this spring. President Truman has not yet estimated how much money he will request from Congress for military aid, but well-informed sources say that the number may reach 1 billion in the 1950 fiscal year. The State Department's statement explained in detail why the United States is active outside the United Nations, stating that "the United Nations has encountered serious obstruction from one country and its allies" and emphasized that the Charter stipulates "regional collective self-defense agreements," so the negotiation of the North Atlantic Treaty by Western democracies is "consistent with the purposes and spirit of the Charter."

### Truman Plans to Propose New Military Aid Funds

Amounting to 1 to 2 Billion US Dollars

Recipient countries include Western European and South American countries, as well as Greece, Turkey, and China. The amount of aid to be given to China will likely depend on the outcome of the current military crisis.

### Exemption of Emperor Hirohito of Japan from War Crimes Was Approved by the Far Eastern Commission, US State Department Formally Announces

[United Press, Washington, 14th] The State Department announced today that all wartime enemies of Japan, including the Soviet Union, agreed to exempt Emperor Hirohito of Japan from charges of war crimes.

After the vote by the Far Eastern Commission, MacArthur regarded Hirohito as the head of the Japanese people. The US instructions to MacArthur were issued in 1946, and were only disclosed in Tokyo recently after the execution of Japanese war criminals such as Tojo.

### Radio Broadcast Peace Terms of the CCP: Speaker Pan Expresses His Views, Urging Both Sides to Immediately and Simultaneously Order a Ceasefire, with Representatives from Each Side Conducting Open and Sincere Discussions in Shanghai

Yesterday, a reporter visited Speaker Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Council to inquire about his views on the CCP's radio broadcast of peace negotiation conditions and the prospects for peace. Mr. Pan replied: The fact that the CCP has presented eight peace negotiation conditions is a progress compared to having no response at all. However, after half a month of public appeals, this broadcast has offered a glimmer of hope for peace. In recent days, fierce battles have raged in Tianjin and Beiping, with the familiar bustling areas of Tianjin already devastated by artillery fire, turning homes into ruins and causing numerous casualties. Beiping, the center of China's cultural relics accumulated over centuries, suffering the ravages of artillery fire would be an unimaginable tragedy. Moreover, after the victory, three years of war have left the people impoverished and both heaven and earth mourn. I believe that if both sides of the conflict truly have the sincerity to consider the suffering of the people and strive for peace, they should immediately agree, without proposing any conditions for now, to issue orders for all frontline troops to cease fire in place from a certain date (especially in the suburbs of Beiping, a ceasefire must be implemented immediately to protect cultural relics), for a period of two months. Representatives elected by local public opinion organs near the frontline areas of both sides should impartially oversee the ceasefire. Then, both sides should immediately dispatch responsible representatives to meet in Shanghai, a city with a history of successful peace negotiations, where several responsible and respected representatives mutually recommended by public opinion organs from both sides, as well as representatives from historically neutral third parties, can mediate, conducting open and sincere negotiations and frankly discussing all conditions and methods to reach a reasonable and fair solution. I believe that we are all Chinese nationals, and if everyone sincerely reduces the suffering of the people, tolerates each other for the sake of the country, and compromises for the sake of the people, what is there that cannot be peacefully negotiated? This is why the Shanghai Municipal Council has twice appealed for peace and suggested convening a peace promotion conference in Shanghai on February 10th. Currently, provincial and municipal councils and national professional organizations have responded enthusiastically by telegram, and some have even proposed an earlier date. I am entirely concerned for the people and earnestly implore both sides to stop arguing about conditions and immediately and simultaneously order a ceasefire to save the people from fire and water. Whoever has the great benevolence and courage to make this decision will bring immeasurable merit and eternal glory to hundreds of millions of people. Furthermore, "He who does not delight in killing is fit to unify the empire," an ancient saying that still holds true today. Our people have no other desires except for world peace, national sovereignty, human rights and freedom, and people's happiness and prosperity.

Furthermore, the Municipal Council initiated a national peace promotion conference to be held in Shanghai on February 10th, and yesterday continued to receive enthusiastic responses from local public opinion organs and national professional organizations. It is reported that Zhang Qiang, Speaker of the Zhejiang Provincial Council, Lu Gongwang, Deputy Speaker, Pei Mingyu, Speaker of the Shandong Provincial Provisional Council, the Shanxi Provincial Council, the National Medical Association, and the Shandong Provincial Chamber of Commerce, among other units, have sent telegrams to the council, expressing their unanimous support and deciding to send representatives to Shanghai to participate in the conference, discuss national affairs, exert the power of the people, and promote the early realization of the peace that the whole country is looking forward to.

### Hotel Industry Price Increase: Effective Today

Furthermore, reasonable regulations are planned for the wages of tea waiters. It has been found that tea waiter wages account for 45% of the total expenses of hotels since the implementation of salary-based compensation. Currently, tea waiters still collect tips in addition to their wages. Therefore, the Counselor's Office will be responsible for reviewing improvement measures before submitting them to the Municipal Council for discussion. It is possible that wages will be abolished and the practice of collecting tips will be restored.

### Xiaoshan Taoyuan New Village: Experimenting with Agricultural Reform, Praised as a Pioneering Innovation After Inspection by the Director of the Relief Commission

Ma Jie, Director of the Rural Industry Demonstration Office of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, recently returned from an inspection of Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province. According to him, there is a new village organized by farmers in the area, named "Taoyuan New Village," about 25 miles from Hangzhou. It has a population of about 5,000 people, and the villagers are engaged in organized and planned production in a cooperative manner, which is a pioneering innovation in rural China and worthy of emulation and promotion. The new village is divided into an experimental zone and has been in operation for only one year. It was initially promoted by the Sanhu Water Conservancy Cooperative and now has a cooperative irrigation organization that is developing water conservancy, improving crop varieties, and improving farming methods. Various plans are being implemented gradually. The village has a health clinic and an elementary school, and vocational schools and various training classes are being organized. On the first visit to the new village, the sight of men plowing and women weaving, vigorously working and dedicating themselves to construction, truly gives one a sense of "Shangri-La" in these days of war and chaos. Ma Jie is very interested in the development of the new village and believes that the new village plan coincides with the purpose of the Rural Industry Office and should be supported. In the past, the office has tried to promote its own improved textile machines in the new village as a preliminary step in improving handicrafts. Currently, the Rural Industry Office is also opening a textile technician training class in the new village area, with a quota of 600 people, and is adopting a loan method to rent textile machines to farmers. Farmers will repay in installments with their labor as compensation, calculated according to wages. In the future, the means of production will belong to the farmers. According to this plan, it is expected that 120 looms and 180 textile machines will be promoted within six months.

Villagers Dong Fugeng and Zhou Gensheng rushed to the scene and saw Shandao in the field, his lower body completely wet, while Qingtang falsely claimed that they had both fallen into the water while fighting each other and was not arrested. After escaping danger, Shandao fled to his brother Ahen, who accompanied him to the Shanghai East Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the police, who arrested Qingtang. At the time, Qingtang was still trying to escape by climbing over the wall, but he was finally captured. The case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office, which prosecuted him for attempted murder. Presiding Judge Chen Shijing of the District Court yesterday concluded the trial and announced the verdict: Hu Qingtang was sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment for attempted murder, and two months imprisonment for attempted escape, to be served concurrently as two years and seven months imprisonment.

### Nanshi Football Match: Pan Team Defeats Far East, Huaguang Wins Over Hengyisheng

Two matches of the Nanshi Football League were held yesterday, with the following results: (1) Pan Team defeated Far East, 2-0; (2) Huaguang defeated Hengyisheng, 1-0. Due to the severe cold weather, the teams did not perform to their full potential, and the audience's interest was also less enthusiastic.

Pan Team and Far East were the first to take the field. Most of the players on both sides were students. Although their skills were not particularly refined, their fighting spirit was extremely fierce. In the first half, Li Zhihua, the right winger of Pan Team, took a corner kick, aided by the wind, and scored a direct goal, opening the scoring. In the second half, Qian Ming of Pan Team added another goal, ending the match with a score of 2-0.

Pan Team:

Song Boshou

Sun Yongda, Xu Tonghua

Qian Ming, Lu Yide, Yang Gengsheng

Fang Renqiu, Qian Changxing, Situ Hou, Cai Liangxian, Li Zhihua

Far East:

Gan Zhong

Tao Bingsheng, Zhang Guohua

Zhou Rongchu, Hua Shoujiang, Wu Jinfa

Sun Bian, Zhuang Xinjia, Wu Zemin, Huang Rubo, Fan Benjun

Huaguang and Hengyisheng continued the competition. Due to the absence of three key players, Hengyisheng's strength was affected, leading to frequent attacks from Huaguang. After twelve minutes, Wu Qixiang of Huaguang took a free kick from 25 yards in front of Hengyisheng's goal. He kicked the ball with force like a cannonball. Chen Shensi, with his hands frozen, failed to catch it, and the ball went straight into the net amidst a burst of applause. Huaguang took the lead with a score of 1-0 in the first half.

After the change of sides, Hengyisheng's reinforcements arrived, boosting their morale. They switched from defense to offense, and the situation changed completely. The ball often revolved in Huaguang's territory. After ten minutes, Huaguang launched another offensive in a charging manner, trying to improve their situation, but unfortunately, their efforts were in vain. In the last quarter of an hour, Hengyisheng was extraordinarily active, but all their shots were wild and inaccurate, failing to achieve any results. As a result, the score remained 1-0, and Huaguang won.

Huaguang:

Chen Huimin

Lu Qitang, Le Dequan

Wang Lianhai, Wu Qixiang, Chen Lianglian

Zhu Jiazheng, Yan Tingzhang, Tu Liangquan, Wang Xingguo, Qian Yunqing, Shang Shiqi

### Six Rice Shops Suspected of Fraud; Defendants Deny Charges; Accounts to be Audited for Re-Trial

[Our Newspaper] Cases of rice shops engaging in fraudulent distribution of subsidized rice for registered households have been occurring frequently recently. Judge Mei Erhe of the District Court yesterday morning again heard the case of six rice shops accused of rice distribution fraud and ordered a postponement for summoning witnesses and auditing the accounts for a re-trial. The six rice shops, namely Yitai, Xin Chang, Gongda, Dafeng, Yuanchang, and Renfeng, were entrusted by the People's Investigation Committee to handle the distribution of subsidized rice for registered households. They allegedly abused their positions to deduct household rice, totaling over 75 shi. This was discovered and reported to the police, and the case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution on charges of embezzlement. The trial opened yesterday morning, and the defendants, Gu Nianong of Yitai Rice Shop, Gu Zhiting of Xin Chang, Gao Guoping of Gongda, Wu Wenhua of Yuanchang, Tao Zhiren of Renfeng, and Sheng Yuanqing of Dafeng, appeared in court for the trial. Each defendant vehemently denied embezzlement, claiming that the remaining household rice in each shop was either stored by buyers or exchanged for other types of rice by residents who did not like to eat household rice. Therefore, the rice in question was actually owned by the shops. After witnesses Bao Tingsheng and Xu Jinfu testified, the court ruled that the amount of suspected embezzlement by the defendants was very large and ordered a postponement for re-trial after the accounts were investigated.

### Handover Ceremony Held Yesterday for New and Former Chairmen of the Export Control Commission; Liu Weichi Discusses Future Trade Policies

[Our Newspaper] The handover ceremony between the new and former chairmen of the Export Control Commission, Liu Weichi and Huo Baoshu, was held yesterday morning at 10:00 AM in the auditorium on the fourth floor of the Bank of China. In discussing future trade policies, the new Chairman Liu Weichi stated: There have recently been demands from various parties to open up free trade. However, from the government's standpoint, opening up free trade at a time when military operations have not yet ceased presents many practical difficulties. In the future, the government will provide as much convenience as possible to the industrial and commercial sectors based on the actual situation and gradually relax restrictions to achieve free development. The foreign exchange transfer certificate system has made significant contributions since its implementation, and efforts are being made to improve its shortcomings. As for the examination and approval of overseas Chinese investment returning to the country, the government will seek to relax restrictions without stimulating the market to meet actual needs. In the future, trade with Japan will, in principle, continue to maintain the barter system. However, in Hong Kong, the number of trading companies engaged in trade with Japan has been increasing, and most transactions are in cash. To ensure uniformity, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is considering new measures. Regarding whether the government plans to assist factories in relocating to the south due to the current situation, Mr. Liu stated: As of now, the government has not received any such requests. If manufacturers actively submit such requests, the government will consider providing assistance.

[Further Report] It is learned that Finance Minister Xu Kan and Industry and Commerce Minister Liu Weichi are scheduled to invite the heads of local financial institutions, municipal authorities, and leaders of various industries to a tea party in Shanghai within days to discuss measures to stabilize prices.

### Truck Injures Elementary School Student

[Our Newspaper] Zheng Pengfei, a nine-year-old first-grade student at Chaoyang Elementary School of Shanghai Municipality on Zhonghua Road, Dadongmen, Nanshi, was on his way to school from home at approximately 1:50 PM yesterday when a truck with license plate 03-2012 suddenly sped by and knocked him to the ground, rendering him unconscious. Upon receiving the report, the Northern District Fire Department, led by Director Li Zhiliang, rushed to the scene with volunteer members. After managing to revive him, they rushed him to the hospital for treatment.

### Squandering Allowance Leads Apprentice to Suicide

[Our Newspaper] Jiang Ronghua, a 22-year-old apprentice from Ningbo at Deda Mat Shop at 359 Fujian Road, squandered his allowance and committed suicide. Last December, when his master returned to Ningbo, his hometown, Jiang replaced him in his position as Jia Zhang (local head). Recently, he received over 10,000 yuan in family support fees for new recruits from various households, which he squandered. On the 12th, the Bao Zhang (local leader) came to the shop to collect the family support fees for submission. Unable to make up the amount, Jiang went alone to the Grand Shanghai Hotel at approximately 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, booked room 315, and secretly consumed poisonous liquid. At approximately 4:00 PM, a waiter discovered him and immediately reported it to the Lao Zha Police Sub-bureau, which dispatched officers to investigate. They hired a car to transport him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died at 6:30 PM.

### Public Utilities Still Suffering Significant Losses; Bad Debt Losses are Extremely High; Burden on Citizens is Unreasonable

After the municipal government adjusted the prices of various public utilities this month, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau recently sent the cost accounting tables for the new prices of each company to the Municipal Council for review. According to the figures in the report, even with the new adjusted prices, each company still suffers significant monthly losses. The transportation sector is particularly affected. In the water, electricity, gas, and telephone sectors, bad debt losses still account for a very large proportion of the cost calculation, with the highest reaching 30%, which is a very unreasonable burden on the majority of citizens.

According to the previous statistical tables, although the fare adjustments for various land transportation services ranged from 128% to 204%, the operating revenue was still insufficient to cover their expenses. The main reason for the losses of various companies is that fare evasion has not been completely eliminated. The total revenue of the Public Transportation Company was 13,835,000 yuan, while the total expenditure was 29,949,967 yuan. The total revenue of the British-owned Shanghai Tramway Company was 16,655,000 yuan, while the total expenditure was 30,185,416 yuan. The total revenue of the French-owned Tramway and Electricity Company was 12,542,000 yuan, while the total expenditure was 23,001,752 yuan. The total revenue of the Shangchuan Transportation Company was 868,000 yuan, while the total expenditure was 1,683,998 yuan. The total revenue of the Shangnan Transportation Company was 465,000 yuan, while the total expenditure was 1,107,241 yuan.

As for bad debt losses in the water, electricity, gas, and telephone sectors, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company had the highest losses, amounting to 4,400,000 gold yuan, accounting for 30% of the total cost, which is six times higher than taxes and levies. Other companies, such as British, French, Mainland, and Pudong, had lower bad debt losses, approximately 2% to 3%. However, with the exception of Pudong Water Plant, all companies showed losses on their balance sheets. The losses for British-owned Shanghai Water Company were 22,149,660 yuan, the French-owned Tramway and Electricity Company was 3,075,000 yuan, the Mainland Water Company was 850,000 yuan, and the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company was 1,462 yuan.

### Deposit and Loan Interest Rates for Banking and Finance Industries to be Determined by Public Consultation

Since the implementation of the Supplementary Measures for Improving Economic Controls, the measures restricting deposit and loan interest rates for banks and money shops have been temporarily suspended. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance, in order to encourage banks and money shops to adapt to market conditions at any time, absorb as much deposits as possible, and use them for production and construction, has recently stipulated that the highest interest rates for deposits and loans of local banks and money shops shall henceforth be determined by the local banking, money lending, and trust industry associations, together with the local Central Bank, in accordance with Article 2 of the Interest Rate Management Regulations and Article 30 of the Banking Law. The determined interest rates shall then be announced and implemented by the local Central Bank. In areas where there is no banking, money lending, or trust industry association or Central Bank, the standards stipulated by nearby areas shall be used as a reference, and the Central Bank shall still report the interest rates determined by various localities to the Ministry for record at any time.

### Foreign Exchange Certificates Continue to Fall; Exporters Hope for Improved New Measures

The foreign exchange transfer certificate continued to decline yesterday, opening at 176 yuan in the morning and once falling to a low of 170 yuan. The market slightly recovered in the afternoon, closing at 174 yuan. Overseas remittances still maintained a listed price of 200 yuan. It is learned that the continued decline in foreign exchange transfer certificates is largely due to the Central Bank's Circular No. 170 issued yesterday. The measures severely restrict the buying and selling of foreign exchange, such as requiring the seller to specify the buyer's name and the buyer to present a permit. Since the implementation of these measures, both buyers and sellers have found it inconvenient, resulting in scarce transactions yesterday. Exporters believe that this is a method by the government to suppress exporters, which is extremely detrimental to the industry. If the government does not improve the measures, exporters will face a major crisis. They hope that the government can coordinate both exports and imports, as a one-sided approach will inevitably lead to losses. As for yesterday's market, the difference between the foreign exchange certificate price and the overseas remittance price was over 20 yuan, and the distance from the black market was even greater.

### Measures Limiting Deposit Accounts to Real Names Slightly Amended

The Ministry of Finance's measures supervising the banking and finance industries to limit deposit accounts to real names have been slightly amended regarding the provisions for imposing fines. The original Article 5 of the measures stipulated: "A fine of no less than 20,000 yuan and no more than 200,000 yuan shall be imposed for each deposit account." After the currency reform, the Ministry of Finance revised the original stipulation to: "A fine of no less than 10 gold yuan and no more than 30 gold yuan shall be imposed for each deposit account."

It is now learned that the Ministry, upon instruction from the Executive Yuan, has amended the words "a fine of no less than 20,000 yuan and no more than 200,000 yuan" in Article 5 of the measures to "a fine shall be imposed in accordance with the provisions of the Executive Yuan's Enforcement Law." After receiving the order, the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau has forwarded it to the three associations of banks, money shops, and trust companies in the city, ordering all member banks, money shops, and companies to take note.

### Banks and Money Shops Allowed to Use Reserve Funds to Increase Capital

The Shanghai Financial Management Bureau recently notified the three industry associations of banks, money shops, and trust companies that: (1) All cash reserve funds that banks and money shops should exchange back are allowed to be used to offset cash for increasing capital. (2) The interest on the cash portion of capital adjustments deposited in the Central Bank has been submitted by the Bureau to the Ministry for approval on a special project basis.

Furthermore, it is reported that the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau has submitted to the Ministry for approval the standard for valuing government bonds and treasury bills used by banks and money shops to pay for deposit reserve funds. US dollar bonds are calculated at a ratio of 1 to 20 yuan, and US dollar treasury bills are calculated at a ratio of 1 to 4 yuan, both at 70% of their value. National treasury bonds and treasury bills should be converted into gold yuan and then calculated at 70%. It is now learned that the banking, money lending, and trust industries in the city have once again requested the authorities to allow the conversion of US dollar bonds to be calculated based on the market price of daily exchange certificates and US dollar treasury bills to be calculated at a ratio of 1 to 20 yuan, which is expected to be largely approved.

### Money Market Slightly Bullish

The cash market was tight yesterday as industrial and commercial firms needed to transfer funds due to the mid-month period. Although banks and money shops supplied a lot of cash, it was still insufficient. Banker's acceptances were prevalent, with discount interest easily reaching 10%.

Furthermore, yesterday was the weekend and the middle of January, and the money market in the city turned tighter again. However, general turnover did not appear to be particularly difficult. Market interest rates ranged from 60 yuan to 80 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Industrial and commercial enterprises were well-prepared, so the demand for funds yesterday was not excessive. Although national banks and bureaus had material settlement payments to collect yesterday, it is feared that government spending may not be too high.

### Tung Oil Trends Weak

The tung oil market suddenly showed a sign of wanting to rise in the morning but then weakened. Initially, it continued the momentum from the previous day, and sentiment remained bullish. Sellers continued to try to raise prices, with the process still expected to make slow and steady progress. However, after a while, general merchants, aware that the payroll period was approaching, frequently came to sell, causing the market to suddenly become unsustainable and turn downward. As a result, each transaction was significantly smaller than the previous day.

### Decreased Arrivals and Fewer Sellers; Rice Prices Rise Across the Board; Flour Remains Firm, Edible Oil Slightly Higher

The rice market slowly rose yesterday due to decreased arrivals and fewer sellers. In addition, merchants were determined to raise prices due to high shadow interest rates. The morning market immediately increased by 50-60 yuan, and the closing price remained firm. At the Nanshi market, white japonica and thin indica were each sold at 1,420 yuan, up 70 yuan. Thin indica also rose 70 yuan to 1,470 yuan. Xian rice rose 50-60 yuan, while white yuan and yin yuan rose more sharply, increasing by over 100 yuan. At the Beishi market, thick and thin japonica and yang xian each rose 50 yuan, early rice rose 30-40 yuan, and glutinous rice rose sharply by 100 yuan. The total arrivals at the North and South markets were 6,072 shi.

Flour continued the firm momentum from the previous day's close and rose again. The slightly looser money market caused merchants to raise prices, resulting in a slight increase. Old car flour opened at 540 yuan, reached 550 yuan at one point, and closed slightly lower at 444 yuan, an increase of 19 yuan. Bingchuan flour rose to 532 at the close, an increase of 28 yuan. Red Bee and Jiancheng rose over 40 yuan due to the low prices the previous day. Large-bag bran rose over 20 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains were thriving. As rice prices rose slightly, sentiment was slightly firmer, and merchants were determined to raise prices. Soybeans finally rose 50 yuan. Corn from the northern region continued to be purchased, and arrivals were scarce, rising 50 yuan. Selected green beans were in short supply, and trading was limited. Tea beans from the Guangdong region were slightly purchased, rising 100 yuan. Red sorghum rose 50 yuan, and Jiangyan red sorghum was sold at 500 yuan. Sesame seeds turned firmer by 100-200 yuan, raw peanuts were stable, and Yangzhou raw peanuts remained at 2,500 yuan.

Edible Oil showed a slight upward trend. Due to high prices in Wuxi, merchants' intentions remained firm and they were strongly holding prices. Soybean oil once rose to 5,000 yuan, closing at 4,900 yuan, slightly higher by 200 yuan. Rapeseed oil from the factory opened higher, rising first and then falling, remaining stable at 4,300 yuan. Jitou rapeseed oil was 5,400 yuan, also rising 200 yuan. Small-car sesame oil was slightly higher by 50 yuan. Factories offered limited amounts of soybean cake. Changzi cake was 375 yuan, up 45 yuan.

### Authorities Continued to Sell Off Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] China Textile Construction Company continued to sell yarn on behalf of the National Bank and the American Aid Association yesterday. A total of 2,200 pieces were offered, with 124 purchasers requesting a total of 615 pieces. As a result, 610 pieces were sold, recovering 30,617,000 yuan. The sales were divided into five rounds of bidding, as follows:

(1) 20-count Jincheng sold 88 pieces at 43,000 yuan per piece. (2) 32-count Lanfeng stopped selling 98 pieces at 58,000 yuan per piece. (3) 42-count stranded Lanfeng sold 95 pieces (of which China Flying Wheel Factory was stopped from distributing 5 pieces due to outstanding tube debts) at 73,000 yuan per piece. (4) 21-count Jin Shuangma sold 217 pieces at 44,000 yuan per piece. (5) 20-count Lima sold 117 pieces at 43,000 yuan per piece.

In addition, the company sold cloth as usual yesterday, selling a total of 7,630 bolts of cloth and 970 bed sheets. There were 342 purchase orders, recovering 13,353,700 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn Market Relaxed

The cotton yarn market was dull yesterday. Factories were offering more for sale due to payroll reasons, while customers were not loosening their purse strings as the Lunar New Year approached. The market remained rangebound between 6 and 7 jiao, and the situation was very relaxed. Market trading was sluggish, with narrow fluctuations, and prices for various grades softened by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Later, prices rebounded slightly as there was some buying at lower prices. 42-count Lanfeng was 75,000 yuan, 40-count Jincheng was 71,000 yuan, 22-count Yinyue was 61,000 yuan, 21-count Shuangma fell below 50,000 yuan, 20-count Tiannv was 47,000 yuan, and 16-count Guangming was 39,000 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth Bidding Prices Sharply Lower

The cotton cloth market was depressed yesterday as external commodity prices were reported to be weak. Various parties were adjusting their finances to get through the year, resulting in more supply than demand. The market was sparsely populated yesterday, and as it was the weekend and the date for China Textile to open cloth sales, people left early. The trend of funds in the market was still average. In general, there were many sellers due to the approaching Lunar New Year. Longtou fine cloth fell below the 2,000 yuan mark outside the market, hovering around 1,800 yuan. Sijunzi Yuan Biji opened at 1,770 yuan and closed at 1,680 yuan. Longtou B fine cloth was 1,58 yuan, a decrease of 30-40% compared to the previous day.

### Last Year's National Export Settlement (Continued and Concluded)

The total amount of foreign exchange settlement by both merchants and the government was $237,518,944.86 (the above categorized statistics do not include Guangzhou, Kunming, and Shantou from January to June, so the number is less than the statistics by port).

In addition, the amount of foreign exchange settlement applications for export goods from Shanghai alone last year increased by $50 million compared to the previous year, with a total figure of $175,823,513.68 when converted to US dollars. This included $74,112,199.47 for export goods settled by the government itself (i.e., frozen eggs, mineral sand, sugar, etc.).
