### Shanghai Delegation Flies to Gubei This Morning - Three Members Scheduled to Stay for a Week - Shao Lizi Arrives in Shanghai, Decides to Go North

[Report from this newspaper] The city's peace delegation is scheduled to fly to Peiping at 10 a.m. on the 9th. The list of delegation members was changed again after a meeting at Yan's residence yesterday at 4 p.m., and the final decision was Yan Huiqing, Zhang Shizhao, and Jiang Yong. Ou Yuanhuai, Ling Xianyang, and Hou Debang all temporarily canceled their plans to go to Peiping due to health or business reasons. Peace elder Shao Lizi is also going this time in a private capacity. In addition, those who will fly to Peiping on the same plane include Mr. Huang Qihan, a friend of Vice President Li, Jiang Youfu, the son of Jiang Yong, five secretaries, one doctor, and one attendant. The delegation will travel on a China Aviation special plane, which will take off from Longhua Airport this morning and land in the western suburbs of Peiping. Permission has been obtained from the Chinese Communists to use wireless communication with the Xijiao Airport. The stay in Peiping is scheduled for one week, and wireless telephone communication can be maintained with Nanjing. According to relevant sources, the peace delegation is carrying a letter from Acting President Li to the leaders of the Chinese Communists. The longer the delegation stays in Peiping, the better, as the longer the time, the greater the harvest.

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] Shao Lizi and Gan Jihou flew to Shanghai by plane on the morning of the 8th to continue exchanging views with Yan Xianqing, Zhang Shizhao, and others of the Shanghai Peace Delegation. Shao has decided to fly to Peiping on the same plane as Yan and others in a private capacity, and Shao's personal secretary Zhang Fengwei will also go.

[Report from this newspaper] Shao Lizi arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning on the same plane as Acting President Li, and is scheduled to fly to Peiping with the peace delegation on the 9th. Shao declined to comment on the mission to the north, saying only that he was exchanging views with the other party in a private capacity, and the stay in Peiping would be about one week.

[United Press International, Peiping, 8th] Nanjing University professors, members of the peace delegation, made their first contact with Communist leaders here on the 8th. Unofficial but reliable sources say that the Nanjing delegation met with Communist military leader General Ye Jianying yesterday afternoon. General Ye told these university professors that the Shanghai delegation had agreed to come to Peiping, but did not express any opinion on how or when the military and political leaders of North China would receive the Yan mission or whether they would be willing to accept their request. It is said that General Ye hinted that the sooner the better, but did not explain the reason. The Nanjing delegation left the Six Nations Hotel, where they were staying, yesterday afternoon, and refused to discuss the contents of the talks with reporters after returning to their residence. This point coincides with General Ye's previous clear indication that the contents of the discussion should not be mentioned to at least foreign and outside journalists. It is understood that the Chinese journalists who flew to Peiping at the same time as the Nanjing delegation are still stranded at Xiyuan Airport.

[Associated Press, Peiping, 8th] The Communist Party does not regard the eleven members of the Nanjing Peace Delegation as possible tools for resolving national affairs. It is reported that Ye Jianying, chairman of the Military Control Commission, intends to meet with the representatives separately and have purely private talks with them. In other words, they are not regarded as a delegation. Yesterday, Ye met with three representatives of the delegation. The Communist Party does not seem to attach much importance to the delegation, and it is expected that the overall situation will not make substantial progress until the delegation led by Yan Huiqing arrives.

### Gan Jihou Solemnly Explains the Communist Attack as a Misunderstanding - Declares He Is Not Discouraged, Hopes Both Sides Will Endure Humiliation and Bear Heavy Burdens

[Report from this newspaper] Mr. Gan Jihou came to Shanghai from Nanjing again at 10 a.m. to preside over the preparations for the delegation's trip to Peiping. He met with reporters in the evening and said that he originally intended to invite Chen Guangfu and Leng Yuqiu to participate in the delegation's trip to the north, but after negotiations at Yan's residence at 4 p.m., everyone else except Yan, Zhang, and Jiang had their own difficulties and could not spare the time to go. Regarding the attack in the Shaanxi Northern Broadcasting the night before, Gan solemnly explained, "In the past week, we contacted Peiping by long-distance telephone, and there was no problem with going to Peiping, but because I explained at the previous reception that the task of the peace delegation was to ask the Chinese Communists to decide on the location and time of peace talks as soon as possible, I was criticized by the Chinese Communists. I am not angry about this, because I understand that this is a misunderstanding, which led to doubts. As for the accusation of a peace offensive, we have 100% sincerity, and the Chinese Communists have repeatedly stated that they want to shorten the war and reduce the suffering of the people, so the goals of both sides are the same, and we also believe that the Chinese Communists are sincere about peace. Under these circumstances, a peace offensive cannot occur. At the same time, peace is the demand of the whole people, not the business of the United States. If the whole people want peace, the United States cannot stop it, so there is no such thing as 'cheap American goods.' Although I am now being subjected to this kind of attack, I am not discouraged in my efforts for peace. Although I have suffered some grievances personally, the task of peace has the possibility of being accomplished, and the delegation's flight to Peiping is a major progress in the situation. Peace is the business of the whole people, and both sides should not only endure for the country, but also endure humiliation and bear heavy burdens, and hope that the Chinese Communists can understand this."

He expressed that he was not discouraged about the future of peace, because peace is the demand of the people of the whole country, and the government has long had this determination. In his conversation, he also hinted that at most, the Yangtze River would be used as a boundary in the future to divide the political power. He strongly denied the rumor that Acting President Li and President Sun had different political views, and pointed out that it was an intentional provocation from the outside. In this serious situation, internal division is not allowed. He also said that President Sun and himself would both go to Nanjing within a week, and would frequently travel between Nanjing and Guangzhou in the future. He may go to Hong Kong first on the 9th, but did not say what the mission was.

### Guangzhou Housing Shortage Is Severe - Rent Is Priced in Kind - Director of Land Administration Bureau Explains

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] Since the government moved south to work, the number of residents in Guangzhou has increased sharply, and the housing rental problem is very serious. Li Pusheng, Director of the Municipal Land Administration Bureau, told reporters today that since the partial relocation of the government to the south, the number of residents in the city has suddenly increased. In addition to the municipal government assisting various agencies in finding office locations, there are still many family members who have come to the city, resulting in an increasingly serious housing shortage. It is inappropriate for landlords to take this opportunity to demand exorbitant rents, but in recent times, the value of currency has fluctuated sharply. If we adhere to the housing rental regulations, the landlord's losses would be too great, so it is no wonder that landlords are unwilling to accept them. Therefore, in order to maintain the actual value of the landlord at the time of signing the contract and to quell disputes, this is a problem that needs to be solved urgently. Therefore, some advocate using a base number for rent, and some advocate using rice. In fact, rice is the most used now, and it is fairer to pay according to the price of the rice market on that day, because the government has already used rice to rent houses. Using foreign currency, but using official language to handle people's disputes, I feel that my conscience is ridiculous, so the government must formally recognize this fact before it can be easily handled. Otherwise, if the law is too far from the facts, it will not work on its own.

### Communist Army Activities West of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway - Plan to Threaten the Capital's Flank - National Army Seeks to Recover Nantong

[Report from this newspaper, Puzhen, 8th] The Communist Army's activities on the northern bank of the Yangtze River west of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway are gradually becoming more active. After the National Army voluntarily evacuated the cities of Quanjiao, Chaoxian, Wuwei, Hanshan, and Hexian, it was recently reported that a large number of Communist troops have entered and stationed in each of these cities. According to a high-ranking military official who told reporters, the Communist Army will change its tactics from facing the National Army head-on, which is concentrated on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway front, and will especially attack from the flanks. It will inevitably use the various sandbars above and below Hexian as a springboard to carry out its landing in places such as Caishezhen on the south bank in an attempt to threaten the capital's flank. However, the National Army is closely monitoring this.

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 8th] The county towns in the northern part of Jiangsu on the northern bank of the Yangtze River that are still firmly defended by the National Army are Jiangpu and Yiwei.

Editorial

### Shanghai School Tuition Issues

As winter fades and spring returns, Shanghai's public and private schools at all levels are approaching the start of the school year. Before the term begins, schools face two serious problems: first, the stationing of troops in schools, affecting the start of classes; second, school fees are based on the price of rice, increasing the burden on students' parents. The former pertains to military discipline and social order, essentially unrelated to school education, but it can affect education. The latter pertains to the education system, essentially unrelated to social order, but now it can constitute a social problem. Regarding the withdrawal of troops stationed in schools, various schools have made this request, but it is difficult to say whether the withdrawal can actually occur and whether it will hinder the start of classes. Currently, what weighs heavily on the education sector, especially on the minds of general students' parents, is the issue of school fees, which is attracting considerable attention; and yesterday, a partial solution was reluctantly achieved.

Regarding the tuition fees for schools at all levels this semester, the authorities of universities, middle schools, and elementary schools have made relatively specific decisions, and some city councilors have also participated in the discussion. Regarding the tuition standards for colleges and universities this semester, the principals of private colleges and universities reached a preliminary decision at a meeting on January 10: the tuition and miscellaneous fees for colleges would be calculated based on three and a half piculs of rice, while universities would be calculated based on the price of four and a half piculs of rice, with a principle of collecting the full amount at once. Some university presidents advocated charging fees based on a multiple of the cost of living index. For example, St. John's University and Datong University would divide the semester into three terms, with tuition and fees for each term at St. John's calculated by multiplying a base of 32 yuan by the cost of living index, and at Datong, multiplying a base of 31.33 yuan by the cost of living index. Soochow University would divide the semester into two terms, with a base fee of 48 yuan for each term. Whether based on the cost of living index or calculated with rice, the amount of fees for colleges and universities this semester is alarmingly high. Regarding the tuition standards for public and private primary and secondary schools this semester, since the City Council provided that "the amount of tuition and fees for private schools in the next semester should be converted into the price of commodities, and no additional charges may be levied after full payment" at the end of last year, this provided convenience for primary and secondary schools to use a small amount of rice as the standard for fees, paving the way for this approach. The Municipal Education Bureau did not oppose this idea, but only hoped that the fees would not be too high, increasing the burden on parents of poor students. For a month, the principals of public and private primary and secondary schools held meetings to discuss tuition standards, but they did not reach a unified opinion. Due to the urgency of the start of the school year, a meeting convened by the Municipal Education Bureau on February 5th barely managed to agree on the fees for this semester, using rice as the standard, stipulating that primary schools would charge from 7.5 dou to 1.5 shi, junior high schools from 1.75 shi to 2.5 shi, and senior high schools from 2.25 shi to 3 shi. If this becomes the final decision, the high numbers and the huge differences would not only shock students' parents, but even someone who studies educational theory would feel that this subtle application is not education to cultivate the new generation, but rather to destroy this generation.

Education serves the times, and receiving education is a right. Any violation or deviation from this highest principle is gravely related to the prosperity and decline of society. Undoubtedly, today's education, because of the government's depleted treasury, relies on the assistance of private schools, and the prevailing trend makes receiving education almost like purchasing education; this is entirely the behavior of a commercial society and commercial education. The financial difficulties of public and private schools at all levels in Shanghai are a factual problem, and it is questionable whether the labor income of students' parents can afford these heavy tuition fees, in other words, whether they have this purchasing power. Therefore, in today's extremely difficult situation and such social and economic conditions, it is hoped that there will be a proper relief measure to maintain school funding and take care of parents' burden. The proposed rice-based tuition standards should not be rigidly implemented by the schools.

What kind of measures are in line with the principles of appropriateness and relief, and that are mutually beneficial, truly require educationists and educational administrative authorities to consider the glory of education and the burden on students' parents, face reality, use wisdom, and seek a fair and reasonable level, reducing tuition fees and relaxing the scale of one-time collection. The amount of fees decided by the municipal government yesterday morning in consultation with the principals of private middle schools stipulates: (1) primary school tuition is 6,500 yuan, junior high school is 11,000 yuan, and senior high school is 15,000 yuan. (2) Schools may collect fees in installments, and students may also apply to pay in installments, but not exceeding three installments. (3) For those who pay in installments, primary schools use 40 yuan as the base, junior high schools use 64 yuan as the base, and senior high schools use 90 yuan as the base, dividing by the number of installments and paying according to the cost of living index for that period. Overall, it is considered more reasonable. Because (1) tuition and fees can be paid in installments to facilitate parents of poor children; (2) the price of rice is not used as the standard, so as not to involve other problems; (3) the average base amount set is not too high, according to the principle of two gold yuan equaling one pre-war legal tender yuan. However, here we must add three points. (A) Poor students should be given free or half-price tuition, and the number of scholarship places and the number of free or half-price places for poor students should be increased to the highest proportion as usual. (B) School finances should be made public, and if the finances of each school are indeed difficult, the municipal authorities should provide appropriate relief. (C) For those with truly long histories and outstanding achievements, the municipal authorities may allow an appropriate increase in the percentage of fees, while those with poor reputations should have their fees reduced. (D) Wealthy students' parents should also do their best and donate generously to help schools and teachers overcome the current difficulties.

### Hunan Province's Issuance of Provincial Currency is Shelved; Xiangtan and Other Counties Issue Subsidiary Currency Vouchers, Disrupting the Monetary System; Price Limits in Changsha Reappear Similar to Post-August 19th Situation

[Our Correspondent in Changsha, 8th] The "Silver Dollar Vouchers," which were once widely discussed, have been suddenly shelved due to various practical and technical difficulties in issuance. In order to cope with the current situation, it was decided to issue "Treasury Vouchers" by the Changsha Municipal Bank in another way, still based on silver dollars, with a total amount of 50,000 yuan, adopting a full reserve system. In addition, the Changsha County Government is also planning to issue subsidiary currency vouchers to facilitate grain households in paying grain taxes.

### Tang Honglie, Representative of Cheng Qian, Arrives in Guangzhou to Discuss Hunan-Guangdong Economic Cooperation; Liu Jianxu and Liu Fei, on Cheng Qian's Orders, Go to Guangzhou and Hankou Respectively

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th] Supervisor Tang Honglie, this time representing Acting Chairman Cheng Qian, arrived in Guangzhou on the 7th to discuss economic cooperation between Hunan and Guangdong provinces with Chairman Xue. That evening, he exchanged preliminary views with Chairman Xue. According to Tang, he told reporters: "The relationship between Hunan and Guangdong provinces has always been close, and economic exchange and cooperation are necessary. When Chairman Wei previously governed Guangdong, the two sides had negotiated a more specific plan as the basis for economic cooperation between the two provinces. Chairman Xue has governed Hunan for many years and has a close relationship with the people of Hunan and has a deep understanding of the situation in Hunan. I am convinced that the economic ties between the two provinces will have further achievements in the future. As for the rumors that Hunan Province has issued silver dollar vouchers, according to what I know in Changsha, Acting Chairman Cheng, based on the need to consolidate the credit and value of the gold yuan vouchers and to facilitate the people who have already widely used silver dollars, has ordered the relevant authorities to release effective measures to issue silver dollar subsidiary currency vouchers, which is one of these measures. As this matter is of great importance, it is still under careful study and deliberation, and whether and when it will be issued has not been decided. Furthermore, the saying that the Hunan Provincial Government withholds national taxes is purely unfounded."

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 8th] Liu Jianxu went to Hankou a week ago for official business, returned to Changsha after a brief rest.

### World Disarmament Issue: Security Council Reopens Debate; Expected Soviet Representative to Present New Proposals

[United Press International, Lake Success, 8th] Soviet Representative Malik is expected to engage in East-West debate on the world disarmament issue at the Security Council meeting on the 8th. Western delegations are eagerly awaiting the Soviet representative's speech, as they believe it may reveal clues about the next move in Stalin's "peace offensive." Malik and his aides have not further confirmed their intention to speak, but United Nations officials point out that the discussions on the disarmament issue have been postponed twice to allow Malik ample preparation time. The United States and Britain have no intention of commenting on this issue unless the Soviet Union puts forward new accusations or new proposals. In view of Stalin's recent proposal for gradual disarmament between the United States and the Soviet Union, some delegations believe that the Soviet Union may propose some new or revised disarmament proposals. At the Paris General Assembly, the Soviet Union's proposal for immediate one-third disarmament by the five major powers and simultaneous abolition and destruction of atomic weapons was rejected by an overwhelming majority. The issue currently pending before the Security Council is the General Assembly resolution passed by the Western countries with a majority vote over Soviet protests. This resolution states that disarmament is impossible under the current poor state of international relations and only stipulates that the United Nations Conventional Armaments Commission should re-discuss theoretical disarmament, pending an improvement in international relations for implementation. Due to the recent peace proposals from the Kremlin, Malik may propose some revisions to the rejected one-third disarmament plan, but the result will still be nothing more than a heated exchange of words. There will be no concrete steps towards reducing armaments, troops, and military spending, as disarmament at present clearly conflicts with Western plans to arm the Western European Union and sign the North Atlantic Treaty to prevent communist aggression.

### United States Continues Aid to European Recovery; Requests Appropriation of $5.58 Billion; Acheson and Hoffman to Testify Before Congress

[United Press International, Washington, 7th] Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally introduced a bill on the 7th, requesting continued financial assistance for the European Recovery Program for fifteen months, from April of this year to June 1950. During this period, the Economic Cooperation Administration will be allocated $5.58 billion. However, he warned that "Europe must make its own efforts" to make this plan successful. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom also introduced a similar bill in the House of Representatives.

[Our Own Dispatch] Washington, 8th Broadcast: US Secretary of State Acheson testified before the Foreign Relations Committees of both houses today, stating that one of the achievements of the European Recovery Program is the significant progress in collective security in Europe.

The Brussels Pact is an explicit expression of the signatory countries' determination to maintain their independence and freedom against external aggression, and it has had a major impact on enhancing the sense of security necessary for reconstruction efforts. The United States warmly welcomes this pact and views it as an important contribution to recovery.

[United Press International, Washington, 8th] Economic Cooperation Administrator Hoffman told the Foreign Relations Committees of both houses on the 8th, "Although economic aid to China is also one of the responsibilities of the Economic Cooperation Administration, we will not be presenting any recommendations regarding China at this time while listening to the European Recovery Program." Hoffman continued, "In the current rapidly changing situation, economic assistance in unstable regions is continuing on a day-to-day basis. Temporary recommendations and some revisions to the China Aid Act itself will be submitted to Congress for consideration at a later date." He also stated that preliminary plans for aid to Korea would also be submitted before April 1st. Hoffman declared, "Europe has passed the first stage of economic recovery. In the coming months, it must grasp the more difficult issue of making major adjustments to the traditional way of thinking in Europe, which now consumes its own money in the world and is no longer suitable." Hoffman urged Congress to continue implementing European economic recovery, estimating that $5.58 billion would be needed in the next five months.

The Foreign Relations Committees of both houses clearly expressed sympathy, and their approval seems to be a foregone conclusion. Hoffman praised the progress made by recipient countries in the first year of the Economic Cooperation Administration's work on recovery and declared that there was no need to be overly pessimistic about the recent gloomy report from the European Economic Cooperation Office. He stated that the report was not a prediction of future failure but a diagnosis of current weaknesses, so that salvage methods could be found in cooperative readjustments. The report only stated that the current separate recovery programs would not enable Europe to be self-sufficient in four years. In view of this conclusion of the European Economic Cooperation Office, ways to change and integrate the separate national programs can be considered.

### Authorize President Truman to Reorganize Administrative Agencies

The six representatives who are about to fly to Beiping to negotiate peace with the CCP were invited by Acting President Li yesterday morning to exchange views, which conflicted with the meeting time. None of them attended, except for Ling Xianyang, who arrived at the meeting place, signed in, and left in a hurry.

The preparatory meeting yesterday was presided over by Pan Gongzhan. After the chairman's speech, representatives from various regions spoke one after another, unanimously resolving the following three items: (1) Immediately telegraph the Hankou Seven Provinces and Cities Peace Promotion Association, requesting them to send representatives to Shanghai to present their peace proposals for joint discussion, and immediately contact the Hankou Seven Provinces and Cities Peace Promotion Association by long-distance telephone. (2) The Shanghai Peace Promotion Association decided to postpone the meeting to the 12th of this month. (3) Shanghai Municipal Council Deputy Speaker Xu Jigang was publicly elected as the temporary chairman of the general assembly.

The opinions expressed by Speaker Pan and representatives from various regions at yesterday's preparatory meeting are recorded separately below:

### Speaker Pan's Opening Remarks: Uphold the People's Stand, Reduce the People's Suffering

Speaker Pan's opening remarks and report on the political changes between the KMT and the CCP over the past month briefly stated: "On January 8th of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Council issued a telegram promoting peace, which has been enthusiastically responded to by provincial and municipal councils and national professional organizations across the country. This shows the eagerness of the people across the country to seek peace. The Shanghai Municipal Council is willing to take on the responsibility of preparing and convening the Peace Promotion Association. Representatives from various regions have also arrived in Shanghai one after another, and it has been exactly one month since then. During this month, the CCP's broadcasts and the central government's dispatch of peace talk representatives have undergone various changes. However, the Peace Promotion Association will always stand on the people's stand and seek to reduce the suffering of the people from war. The convening of this association is truly related to the future lives and safety of compatriots across the country. All of you have come from afar, and I hope you can express your opinions as much as possible so as to achieve the goal of peace."

Henan

Provincial Councilor Zhang Honglie stated briefly: "Peace is what everyone hopes for. Only with peace can everyone live and work in peace. However, what we need is true peace, which at a minimum must guarantee freedom of body, occupation, and residence."

Beiping

Municipal Council Representative Deng Cuiying stated briefly: "I believe that China has not been able to achieve peace up to now, and the KMT and the CCP must bear responsibility, but the people also have a responsibility. If the people love peace, the KMT and the CCP will definitely not fight. I remember when I was in Beiping, I received a telegram from Shanghai calling for peace and immediately responded enthusiastically. I specifically set up an office in Zhongshan Park to wait for the progress of peace work. Unfortunately, Shanghai has been silent since then. We always feel that Shanghai is close to the government, so it has ignored our longing for peace. If the enlightened people in Shanghai had advocated peace a year and a half ago, the North would not have suffered such a major loss. This is truly a disgrace to the people themselves, but it is not too late to convene the Peace Promotion Association now. I hope that this association will continue its work until the country achieves peace one day."

Shandong

Provincial Council Speaker Pei Mingyu stated briefly: "Since the victory, if both the KMT and the CCP had competed in production and construction, China would have made unimaginable progress by now. Unfortunately, the civil war broke out, causing the people to be exhausted and suffering immensely. Now is the time for the people to awaken. I hope everyone will move forward together on the road to peace, and then China will still have bright and brilliant hope."

Shenyang

Municipal Council Representative stated briefly: "I left Shenyang when Shenyang had not yet fallen. Now I am here to participate in this Peace Promotion Association. I don't know if I am qualified to be a representative. I think the Communist army should first stop military action so that peace talks can succeed."

Jehol

Provincial Council Speaker Wang Zhiyun stated briefly: "There is a national Peace Promotion Association in Shanghai, and there is also a national Peace Promotion Association in Hubei. We received two telegrams at the same time. I don't know which one is better to participate in. I hope the two sides will join forces first and avoid division."

Peace as the Goal, Saving Lives as the Slogan

National Federation of Commerce Wang Xiao stated briefly: "The people need peace, and it has reached the point of crying for help. No matter which is a good government and which is a bad government, the people are unwilling to kill each other. Now we are convening this Peace Promotion Conference. We should take peace as the goal and saving lives as the slogan."

National Association of Western Medicine Physicians Qin Qin stated briefly: "The Kuomintang government of the Three Principles of the People has never achieved the goal of solving the people's livelihood problem since the Northern Expedition. If it maintains the status quo, it is impossible to ask for peace."

China Women's Organization Federation Representative Zhuang Jing stated briefly: "The people love peace, especially women love peace, because women can never break away from the family, and peaceful life is the foundation of a happy family. Since ancient times, women have never launched wars. However, we feel that the peace in Beiping is a disguised surrender, and the CCP's obstruction of Shanghai's representatives is an undemocratic manifestation."

Finally, National Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine Physicians Representative Jin Songpan stated briefly: "There is a Peace Promotion Association in Shanghai, and there is also a Peace Promotion Association in Hubei. This shows that the opinions of the Chinese people are divergent and their spirit cannot be concentrated. We should quickly telegraph the Peace Promotion Association of the seven provinces and cities in Hubei and ask them to come to the meeting, otherwise we will all fly to Hubei to hold the meeting."

### Chongqing Municipal Council: Too Far to Participate

[Central News Agency Dispatch, Chongqing, 8th] The standing committees of the Chongqing Municipal Council held a joint meeting today and decided not to participate in the Peace Promotion Associations initiated in Shanghai and Hankou, citing the distance as the reason.

[Our Own Dispatch, Lanzhou, 8th] The Provincial Council has dispatched the Speaker and Deputy Speaker to participate in the Shanghai Peace Conference.

### Many Difficulties in Repairing Airports, Difficult to Resume Flights Between Shanghai and Hankou

The Shanghai-Hankou flights of China and Central Aviation Companies have been suspended for two months. According to the two companies. It is difficult to expect the flights on this route to resume in the short term. There is no special reason for the suspension of the Shanghai-Hankou route. The Wuchang Airport, which is used for civilian aircraft to take off and land, has been in disrepair for many years, resulting in uneven ground and runways. There are many difficulties for aircraft to take off and land, and it is even more dangerous in rainy weather. The repair costs are huge, and the local government cannot raise funds for repairs. Although there are small-scale repair works, they are of no help. Therefore, it is difficult to resume the Shanghai-Hankou route of civil aviation in the short term.

### Directorate General of Highways Transportation Department Adds Direct Buses Between Shanghai and Wuxi

In order to meet the needs of passengers, the Directorate General of Highways has added direct, reserved-seat buses between Shanghai and Wuxi starting today. A bus will depart from both Shanghai and Wuxi at 9 a.m. every day, providing convenience for passengers. The Shanghai ticket offices are located at No. 86 Guangdong Road, First Transportation Department, and No. 865 Qiujiang Road, the Shanghai Station of the Department. It is said that many people have already registered to go.

### Yangtze River Route Resumes, Jiangshun Wheel to Sail to Hankou Today

The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangshun Wheel is scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 1 p.m. on the 9th for Hankou, stopping at Anqing and Jiujiang along the way. The company's Shanghai-Hankou route has been suspended for two weeks. Therefore, the departure of the Jiangshun Wheel is the first Yangtze River route vessel for the company since the Lunar New Year. Since the National Army withdrew from Jiangbei to Jiangnan, shipping companies regarded the Yangtze River route with fear. If the Jiangshun Wheel runs smoothly, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and other shipping companies can resume shipping on the Yangtze River route.

### Normal Scheduling on South China Routes Expected to Resume After the 20th

After the suspension of the North China routes, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's express passenger ships Yuanpei, Qiujin, and Xilin, which were all running on the Shanghai-Tianjin route, were changed to South China routes and scheduled to run on the Shanghai-Qingdao, Shanghai-Shantou, and Shanghai-Guangzhou routes. It is now known that the scheduling of express ships on the South China routes is again confused. This is because various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan mostly chartered these three express ships when they moved from Nanjing to Guangzhou. Therefore, normal scheduling on all South China routes cannot be maintained. However, the relocation of the Executive Yuan to Guangzhou is in its final stages, and it is expected that normal scheduling on all South China routes can be resumed after the 20th of this month.

### Inauguration of Jinan University Professors' Association - Requesting Government to Improve Treatment

The National Jinan University Professors' Association held its inaugural meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at the China Science Society auditorium.

### Municipal Evening Schools to Charge a Uniform 1,400

[Our Report] The Municipal Education Bureau convened a meeting of principals of municipal evening schools yesterday morning. The meeting was attended by Bureau Director Li, Section Chief Sun, and more than ten others, including Cao Fengshan, Lu Erqiang, and Zhang Shi. They discussed the tuition standard for the current semester and resolved that both senior and junior high schools would charge a uniform miscellaneous fee of 1,000 yuan and a textbook fee of 400 yuan. Each school is scheduled to begin enrollment on the 14th of this month.

### Private School Tuition Standards to be Determined by Index - Elementary School Maximum 6,500 - Junior High Maximum 11,000 - Senior High Maximum 15,000 - Payment in Full Preferred

[Our Report] The private school tuition issue, which has been a concern for student parents throughout Shanghai, was resolved yesterday. Mayor Wu convened a symposium at 10:00 AM yesterday morning in the Municipal Government conference room. In attendance were Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Education Bureau Director Li, city councilors, and more than ninety school principals. Director Li first reported on the proceedings of the previous meeting, followed by councilors Zhang Zhongyuan, Chen Gongda, Jiang Hao, and others who expressed their opinions. They all argued that tuition should be based on the cost of living index, not converted into rice, as it was unreasonable. Otherwise, workers would also want to calculate wages in rice, which would affect the stability of the entire society. After thorough discussion, it was decided that the tuition fees for private schools this semester would be based on the cost of living index. Based on pre-war tuition standards, private elementary schools charged 20 yuan, junior high schools 32 yuan, and senior high schools 45 yuan, which were converted to a base of 40 yuan for private elementary schools, 64 yuan for junior high schools, and 90 yuan for senior high schools in Gold Yuan Coupons. Since the cost of living index for the upper period of February has not yet been released, and schools are about to open, it was decided to calculate based on the lower period index of January plus 80%. The maximum tuition should not exceed 6,500 yuan for elementary schools, 11,000 yuan for junior high schools, and 15,000 yuan for senior high schools, with payment in full preferred. Children of public educators and students from genuinely impoverished families can apply for installment payments, but only for two or three installments, not exceeding three installments. The amount will be calculated by multiplying the base figure by one-half or one-third of the current cost of living index, according to the installment ratio.

### Overseas Chinese Paint Factory - Boiler Explosion - Kills Engineer - Two Workers Seriously Injured

[Our Report] At around 11:30 AM yesterday, a boiler in the mezzanine of the Guiqiao Paint Factory at 1344 Song Park Road, Zhabei, exploded due to overheating, resulting in three deaths and injuries. The deceased was engineer Liu Gongdu (25 years old, from Suzhou). Upon hearing a sudden loud noise, Liu knew something was wrong and rushed to shut down the motor. However, after the upper-level building shook, the roof collapsed, breaking his left leg and causing severe internal injuries, leading to his death. The injured were worker He Miaozhang (31 years old), who suffered severe burns all over his body, and one factory building collapsed. Upon receiving the report, the Zhabei 123rd Section Fire Brigade dispatched a fire truck to the scene for rescue, sending the deceased and two injured persons to the Fourth Municipal Hospital. The body was later transferred to the Changde Road mortuary for autopsy.

### Railway Workers' Strike - Trains Halted - Workers Demand Better Treatment and Surround the Bureau - Agreement Reached on Three Points That Evening - Passenger and Freight Rates to be Adjusted from the 11th to Cover Salaries

[Our Report] Workers at the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau went on strike suddenly at around 2:00 PM yesterday, demanding better treatment. Trains on both the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines were completely suspended. More than a thousand workers from the Bureau's Engineering Department, Locomotive Department, and the North General Station surrounded the Bureau, creating a tense situation. Chen Fenke, the Deputy Director of the General Affairs Department, was also beaten in the chaos. Later, He Longqing, the Chief of the Investigation Section of the Songhu Garrison Command, arrived with the garrison troops, dispersed the workers, and mediated the situation, which was resolved to some extent by around 8:00 PM. Workers at the locomotive depot expressed their willingness to resume work, but they still need to coordinate with other sections, so the resumption of work was not very smooth. Only the fifth Shanghai-Nanjing train arrived at the station at 8:50 PM, and no other trains entered or left the station until 10:30 PM late at night. If no new obstacles arise today, traffic is expected to return to normal. As for the meager treatment of current employees, Bureau Director Wang Zhaohuai expressed deep sympathy and resolutely decided at yesterday's Bureau meeting to automatically adjust passenger and freight fares on both lines from the 11th of this month (previously, train fare increases had to be approved by the Executive Yuan). The revenue, in addition to coal costs and necessary materials, will be used to cover employee salaries. That is, employee salaries will be automatically adjusted simultaneously with passenger and freight fares from now on.

This railway strike was first initiated by workers at the Qishuyan Locomotive Factory. On the 4th of this month, the Bureau complied with the union's request to advance the rice subsidy for this month, resolving to convert it to 5,390 yuan per stone of Gold Yuan based on the market price of third-grade white japonica rice on that day plus 10%. At that time, the labor side was also satisfied, but the next day, the price of rice soared. The Qishuyan factory workers raised objections the day before yesterday and blocked trains on the tracks, making five demands: (1) Payment of back wages for January. (2) The 5,390 yuan to be treated as an advance, and another stone of rice to be issued. (3) Two stones of rice to be issued as contingency funds. (4) Five stones of rice to be issued as family evacuation funds. (5) Future salaries and subsidies to be calculated in rice. The dispute at the Qishuyan factory was mediated yesterday by Zhou Yan, the commander of the Suzhou Command, with each person temporarily receiving two dou of rice. The rest is to be implemented after the Bureau's unified adjustment measures.

### Police Station Smashed and Detainees Robbed

At around 2:00 PM yesterday, workers from various units of the Railway Bureau in the city gathered at the Railway Bureau Plaza, claiming to be responding to the petition of the Qishuyan factory workers in Shanghai and shouting for a strike. Traffic on both lines immediately came to a standstill. The number of workers increased rapidly, reaching nearly a thousand or more. However, there were no representatives or demands at the time. Union directors, Bureau Director Wang Zhaohuai, Director Wang Yunxun, and Deputy Director Chen Fenke tried to persuade them without success. At that time, a car from the Ministry of Communications was about to leave, but a blueprint worker from the Engineering Department named Wang Zhongxiang took the lead in blocking the car and deflating the tires. The Railway Bureau Police Department believed that Wang was suspected of disrupting order and arrested him, temporarily detaining him in the direct jurisdiction police station within the Bureau for questioning. After Wang was detained, the crowd rioted, broke into the police station, smashed doors and windows, robbed Wang, and beat Han Kuilin, the Railway Police guarding Wang Zhongqing. After Wang left the police station, he said that he had been electrocuted in the police station and was seriously injured. Upon hearing this, the crowd became agitated, emotions ran high, and they shouted and charged towards the building. The guarding police officers, seeing the tense situation, immediately dispersed, lay on the ground, and held their guns ready to fire.

### Passenger Trains Resume Service at Midnight

Latest News: The 84th Shanghai-Nanjing train departed at 11:30 PM last night, the first passenger train to resume service after the strike.

(Another Report) Yesterday, military trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing line were also affected by the strike and were once suspended. The soldiers were unaware of the reason and mistakenly thought the Bureau was deliberately making things difficult, so incidents of beating stationmasters occurred at Changzhou, Kunshan, and other stations.

### More Than Ten People Ganged Up to Beat Chen Fenke, Who Was Injured

At this critical moment, Chen Chen Fenke, injured Deputy Director of the General Affairs Department, rushed down the stairs and stood between the two parties to ease the situation and avoid a tragedy. In the chaos, someone shouted to beat him, and Deputy Director Chen was beaten by a dozen workers, injuring his waist, back, and face. However, the crowd was finally moved by Deputy Director Chen and stopped charging towards the building, but the situation was still tense at this time. The injured Railway Police Officer Han Kuilin was carried to the workers' club for a "public trial." At 5:20 PM, He Longqing, Chief of the Investigation Department of the Songhu Garrison Command, arrived with a large team of armed soldiers, dispersed the workers on the plaza, went to the workers' club to stop the workers' illegal actions, and rescued Han Kuilin. At this time, rumors spread among the crowd that Wang Zhongqing had died at the Sino-American Hospital due to severe injuries from electrocution. The person in charge of the Police Department stated that no electrocution had been used, and the Police Department had no such equipment at all. The blood on Wang's hand was actually caused by him punching the glass window when the workers smashed the police station, and it was absolutely not fatal.

### Treatment Issues - Direct Negotiations

After Chief He explained the situation, an agreement was reached on three points: (1) Both parties will send representatives to the Sino-American Hospital to examine Wang Zhongqing to determine whether he is dead or has been tortured. (2) Traffic will be restored immediately. (3) Representatives will be sent to negotiate directly with Bureau Director Wang on treatment issues. The workers present at the time agreed with these three points. The workers' representatives immediately set off for the Sino-American Hospital. After investigation, it was found that Wang had voluntarily gone to the hospital for examination at around Xishi, where it was found that his left wrist and other parts had been cut, the epidermis was broken, and the injury was minor. He was discharged after being bandaged, and a certificate of injury was issued by the Sino-American Hospital. Meanwhile, the union directors met with Bureau Director Wang. Bureau Director Wang told them with a very sincere attitude about the decision made at the Bureau meeting to automatically adjust freight rates and adjust treatment at the same time. However, there are many employees and complex organizations in the two bureaus, and it will take about a week to calculate the extent of the treatment adjustment. He also agreed to work with accounting and auditing departments today to check the cash on hand and issue some money in advance. He asked the union directors to convey this to the workers in various departments and urged them to take into account the country and the people and resume work as soon as possible. The union directors left at 8:40 PM, and the storm subsided to this point.

### Municipal School Tuition Standards to be Decided by the Mayor Today

Regarding the municipal school tuition standards, Director Li believed that they should not exceed half of those of private schools, but the figures proposed by the principals were much higher. Director Li will submit them to Mayor Wu for a decision at 10:00 AM this morning.

### Basketball League Game Last Night - Renyu Defeats Huili

[Our Report] In a Group A game in the basketball league yesterday afternoon at 5:30, Huili suffered another defeat. Renyu played extremely well, defeating Huili 63-35. The score was 34-15 in the first half. Huili was out of sync throughout and unable to develop. Wang Cunzhong, Chen Zhengmiao, and Ye Yunshan were unable to play last night, which had an impact. After the game began, Shen Pengju made a layup, opening the scoring. Xu Zhongyi and Wang Huaiting both scored, and Renyu's momentum was strong, leading 6-0. Huili replaced Wei Shu with Xu Shuyuan, but still couldn't find a way to get going. Renyu was able to do whatever it wanted. The first half ended with Renyu leading 34-15. After the break, Huili's situation did not improve. Renyu's forwards were very active. Huili only relied on Cao Zhiji and Zhang Pu to support the situation. When the score was 53-27, Wang Yongfang and Cao Zhiji scored three points in a row, but at 53-33, the score was still a huge difference of 20 points. Huili was finished, and their luck was bad, with many shots missing. The final score was 63-35, and Huili was miserably defeated by Renyu.

### Families of Jiangya Victims - Group Petition at China Merchants Bureau

[Our Report] After the Jiangya ferry disaster, the families of the victims organized a committee and repeatedly requested compensation from the China Merchants Bureau. At the end of last year, the Bureau allocated 5,000 yuan in relief funds to each family. The day before yesterday, the committee sent representatives to the China Merchants Bureau to make three demands: (1) The Bureau should pay each deceased passenger compensation equal to 100 stones of rice. (2) Funeral expenses of 25 stones of white rice. (3) For families whose bodies have not been recovered, coffin and burial expenses should still be calculated and allocated. The Bureau promised to respond at 4:00 PM yesterday. The families first gathered at the Limin East Road Siming Cemetery at 8:00 AM and arrived at the second floor of the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association at around 9:00 AM to wait. Until 4:00 PM, a representative from the Bureau replied, only agreeing to pay another 5,000 yuan in relief funds per person. The compensation issue will not be considered for the time being and will be discussed after the responsibility is determined. After the representatives reported to the families, they felt that the number was too small and expressed their dissatisfaction. They unanimously decided to go to the China Merchants Bureau to petition. They departed in batches from the Hanbo Fellow Villagers Association. After receiving the report, the police authorities, in addition to dispatching a large number of police officers from the Laoza Gate Police Sub-bureau, also dispatched a flying fortress from the General Bureau to provide protection.

### Thieves and Other Criminals Evacuated from Prison - Police Bureau Requested Delayed Release - To Avoid Endangering Social Security

[Our Report] Shanghai Prison continued to evacuate a total of 132 prisoners yesterday, mostly bandits, about 60 or more, and the rest were drug addicts, traitors, thieves, and murderers, but none were well-known figures. The Police Bureau sent a letter to Shanghai Prison requesting that the release of bandits and thieves be delayed to avoid endangering social security. If there is a shortage of prison rations, the Police Bureau is willing to subsidize them. The prison authorities believed that the evacuation of prisoners was an order from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and the Police Bureau's subsidy of prison rations was also not an appropriate measure, so they decided to continue the evacuation. However, before the release of the bailed bandits and thieves, the prison authorities gave them a lecture, encouraging them to reform and become new citizens.

### Commodity Tax Bureau Employees - Demand Relief Funds

[Our Report] The salaries of general employees in various units of the Municipal Commodity Tax Bureau have been only a few hundred to over a thousand yuan per month since October. Since the Lunar New Year, prices have soared, and the small amount is barely enough to survive. Recently, the employees jointly requested the Bureau to issue a one-time relief fund of 50,000 yuan per person and prepared to implement "inability to work" to achieve their goal. Yesterday, after the Bureau Director convened representatives to discuss the matter, he agreed to issue 15,000 yuan per person, but the employees rejected it because it was far from their request and are still in a stalemate.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Calls on Trade Associations to Discuss - Handling of Special Foreign Currency Certificates of Deposit - Resolves to Deny 7.9 Jiao Gold Yuan per US Dollar

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, in response to the Ministry of Finance's reply on the supplementary measures for handling special foreign currency certificates of deposit, convened a discussion with 16 relevant trade associations yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, including import-export, copper, tin, new drugs, iron, steel bars, electrical appliances, wool textiles, and enamel. More than 20 people attended, including Chen Guisheng, Chen Maoxun, Hua Hongtao, Ye Xuxin, Ding Huikang, Chuan Shaocai, and Xiao Erjun. Yan E'sheng chaired the meeting. The chairman first reported that after the Import-Export Management Committee announced the differentiated treatment measures for special foreign currency certificates of deposit, the Chamber had convened various industries to discuss them in detail. As a result, it was believed that the treatment measures were quite different from the original measures. However, in consideration of the country's financial difficulties, they were reluctantly accepted, but four requests were made regarding the offset of technology:

(1) Please issue special foreign currency certificates of deposit quickly. (2) The offset should start from the current quarter, not rigidly stipulated as the eighth quarter. (3) Special foreign currency certificates of deposit should be issued Gold Yuan public bonds at the current exchange rate, which should be converted at the current exchange rate at the time of issuance, not rigidly stipulated as 20 Gold Yuan per US dollar. (4) Gold Yuan public bonds take time to print. Please follow the US dollar short-term treasury bill method and exchange the certificate of deposit for a public bond receipt first. The above four points were telegraphed to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance by the Chamber on December 20 last year, requesting adoption. On February 3, a telegram was received from the Ministry of Finance: (1) The Central Bank is rushing to issue special foreign currency certificates of deposit. (2) The offset is still in accordance with the Yuan's order, starting from the eighth quarter. However, the industrial import review procedures can be expedited by the Import-Export Management Committee. (3) In section B of Article 3 of the treatment measures, for the issuance of public bonds in exchange for certificates of deposit, if the current exchange rate changes in the future, it can be calculated according to the "legal exchange rate" on the date of issuance of the bond. (4) The Central Bank's first issuance of public bond receipts can be handled in principle. However, the issuance of public bonds takes time, and the filling and issuance of receipts requires considerable technical consideration. If the original importers and exporters are willing to exchange for cash, the Ministry can submit a request to the Yuan to amend the regulations and change them to a one-time issuance of cash calculated at a rate of 474,000 yuan per US dollar, which is increased fivefold. The Ministry ordered that this point be answered quickly, so relevant industries were convened to discuss how to respond, etc. After careful study by the attendees, it was decided: (1) Section B of Article 3 of the differentiated treatment measures stipulates that public bonds should be issued in exchange for certificates of deposit according to the "current exchange rate," not the "legal exchange rate." The current exchange rate at that time was noted as 20 Gold Yuan per US dollar. This exchange rate is no longer in effect. Even the government's settlement of foreign exchange for imported or exported goods is calculated according to the settlement transfer certificate, with each US dollar equal to more than 800 Gold Yuan. This is the current "current exchange rate." Since the government's foreign exchange income is calculated based on this, how can it still be converted at 20 yuan per US dollar for debt repayment? The Ministry of Finance should be asked to correct the words "legal exchange rate." In the future, the exchange of certificates of deposit for public bonds should be converted according to the price of the foreign exchange transfer certificate at the time of issuance. (2) If the certificates of deposit are exchanged for cash at a rate of 474,000 yuan per US dollar and then multiplied by five, each US dollar would only be equivalent to 7.9 jiao of Gold Yuan Coupons, which is less than one-fourteenth of the current market price and less than one-thousandth of the current foreign exchange transfer certificate. Moreover, the Ministry must submit a request to the Yuan to amend the treatment measures, and official documents must be processed and passed at meetings, which will take time. At least three months will be required for issuance. In today's malignant inflation, it is even harder to imagine what the value of 7.9 jiao will be after three months. Therefore, all industries find it difficult to accept the Ministry of Finance's cash exchange method and request that the government still exchange the special foreign currency certificates of deposit back at the market price of the foreign exchange transfer certificate at the time of issuance. (3) According to the implementing regulations, special foreign currency certificates of deposit should be offset in six quarters, each quarter lasting three months, for a total of 18 months, starting in November of the 36th year. It has now been 16 months since November of the 36th year, and it is about to be offset. Even if the national currency is exchanged at the market price exchange rate, half of it should be exchanged, but after a delay of one and a half years, no repayment has been made. Government credit has been completely lost, which is heartbreaking. Today, it is really unreasonable to give cash at 7.9 jiao of Gold Yuan Coupons per US dollar. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce must make a sincere statement to the Ministry of Finance, asking Minister Xu of the Ministry of Finance to fulfill his promise to maintain price confidence when he took office, and quickly issue foreign currency certificates of deposit, and issue public bonds at the market price exchange rate at the time of issuance, fulfilling the government's obligations under the contract.

### Meeting of Stock Exchange Brokers to Discuss Resumption Measures

[Our Correspondent] The Stock Exchange has already sent a letter to the Brokers' Association, notifying them of permission to resume business on the 21st and instructing each broker to pay their margin as scheduled. The Brokers' Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon starting at 4:00 PM, chaired by Wang Naixu, Chairman of the Association. After reporting the Stock Exchange's notice of resumption, discussions began. Two important resolutions were made: (1) The brokers' margin is currently stipulated to be 300,000 Gold Yuan for each of the two categories of price-adjusted bonds and stocks, with 40% in cash and the remaining 60% in listed government bonds or state-owned enterprise stocks. All must be paid in full by the 16th of this month. The Association proposed extending the deadline for paying the 60% in substitutes to the end of this month, as the listing date of gold bonds is not yet certain. In addition to state-owned enterprise stocks, it is hoped that private enterprise stocks will also be allowed. Regarding the 40% cash requirement, it is hoped that bank guarantees can be used as a substitute. Regarding these points, it is planned to prepare an official letter and ask Chairman Wang Naixu to contact the Stock Exchange authorities and forward it to the competent authorities for flexible handling. (2) The Brokers' Association urgently hopes that the Stock Exchange will be directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministries of Finance and Industry in the future, to fully protect the legitimate rights and interests of the Stock Exchange and brokers, and that local institutions will not interfere arbitrarily.

### Rice Prices Rise Slightly Outside the Market

Rice: The limited price within the market remains without transactions. The government continues to release 5,000 dan (石), priced at 4,500 yuan. Prices outside the market have seen a slight increase, and transactions are also brisk, especially in early trading. White粳 (Japonica rice) was at 7,300 yuan, later slightly retreating to 7,000 yuan due to poor digestion. Thin稻 (thin-husked rice) also closed at 7,000 yuan, each up 300 yuan. Early稻 (early rice) started at 7,000 yuan, closing at 6,600 yuan. 秈米 (Indica rice) trading was light. 糙粳 (unpolished Japonica rice) was at 5,950 yuan.

Grains: The market remains firm. Soybean prices fluctuated. Oil factories purchased 车豆 (car soybeans), slightly increasing by 300 yuan. 乍豆 (sudden soybeans) were stable. 桑園黃豆 (Sangyuan yellow soybeans) decreased by 10%. 生仁 (raw peanuts) were slightly up 500 yuan, influenced by the rising rice prices. Nanjing and Linhuai Pass were both traded at 12,500 yuan. Sesame supply exceeded demand, and 黄蔴 (yellow sesame) quickly retreated by 1,000 yuan. 苟米 (Gou rice) was inquired about by the Qing Gang (gangster organization), and the market initially fell and then rebounded. Red sorghum sales were sluggish, falling nearly 10%.

Flour: Slightly increased. At the beginning of the market, prices were firm and rising due to relaxed monetary policy and rising rice prices. 老车 (Old Vehicle) and 兵船 (Warship) broke the 3,000 yuan mark. In the middle of the market, due to tighter monetary policy, sellers unloaded goods, and the market became unsustainable. Warship once retreated to defend the 3,000 yuan mark. Afterwards, there were not many fluctuations, and the market hovered. Old Vehicle closed at 3,180 yuan, with a high of 3,200 yuan. Warship opened at 3,050 yuan in the afternoon and closed at 3,040 yuan, with transactions occurring. Bran surged sharply, because the previous day's decline was quite large, and buyers took advantage of the low prices.

Edible Oil: Turned upward, because the previous day's decline was too large. Yesterday, rice prices and off-market prices rose, and market sentiment was slightly firmer. Sellers raised prices. Soybean oil initially started at 35,500 yuan, closing slightly lower at 33,500 yuan. Raw rapeseed oil closed at 27,000 yuan, each up 200 yuan. 吉桶 (Lucky Barrel) raw oil closed at 37,000 yuan, with few offers, up 1,500 yuan. Small cart sesame oil had some sporadic transactions, priced at 38,000 yuan, up 2,000 yuan. Soybean cake also increased by 200 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn Rebounds Firmly

The yarn market initially fell but ended firm. Transactions from local customers remained thin, with only retail investors slightly chasing. As a result, except for 42-count slightly weakening, the rest all flourished. 42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 370,000 yuan to close at 390,000 yuan, down 10,000 yuan from before. 40-count Jincheng rose by 15,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon opened at 290,000 yuan and closed at 320,000 yuan, ultimately rising by 25,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot goods initially opened at 220,000 yuan, and under the pull of the table, once rose to 255,000 yuan, closing at 245,000 yuan, a gain of 3,000 yuan. Factory orders appeared at 230,000 yuan for immediate delivery and 240,000 yuan for next-day delivery.

20-count Double Horse steadily rose from 200,000 yuan to close at 220,000 yuan. Jincheng slightly rose by 5,000 yuan to close at 225,000 yuan. 16-count Guangming initially traded at 190,000 yuan and closed above the 200,000 yuan mark, up 5,000 yuan from before. 10-count Boy Scouts initially opened at the original price of 170,000 yuan and finally rose to 180,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan. The fluctuations in other yarns were very small, making it difficult to be optimistic in the short term.

Cotton Cloth: Hovered and rose slightly. Monetary policy was not too tight. Various cloths initially made progress, but then sensitive parties sold off continuously, and the trend fell again, with a soft state again near closing. Leading fine cloth opened outside the market at 9,500 yuan, fell to 8,900 yuan near noon, and heard that 9,200 yuan had some transactions at noon. Trumpet Boy fine cloth fell all the way from 8,500 yuan to close at 7,550 yuan, a slight increase of 50 yuan from before. B Leading fine cloth still stood at the original level of 7,000 yuan the day before, without moving.

Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge initially opened at 9,000 yuan, once called for a price of 9,200 yuan, closed loosely at 8,100 yuan, and then rebounded to 8,500 yuan, a gain of 550 yuan. Four Gentlemen Yuan Zhigong rose by 200 yuan to close at 7,900 yuan. Dyeing and weaving factories continued to open at the same prices as the previous day, but transactions were not smooth, and the ground situation for various cloths was flat.

### Tung Oil Turns Firm and Excellent Again

Since the trend of tung oil leaned towards the downstream the day before, it opened yesterday with continuous activity. In addition, many off-market materials rebounded, so the mentality of holders also turned firm and excellent, and the process suddenly and rapidly recovered. As a result of the close, there was a consistent gain of more than 1,000 yuan. However, 青油 (green oil) remained in a stalemate, with supply and demand being relatively equal.
