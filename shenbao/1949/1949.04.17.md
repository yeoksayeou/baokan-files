### The Chinese Communists Propose Two Demands: Forming a Joint Organization and Crossing the Yangtze River, Hoping for a Government Response by the 20th

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] It is learned that the Chinese Communists have expressed demands to the government similar to those for peace in the Beiping style, and hope the government will respond before the 20th. This news was revealed by a highly authoritative source on the evening of the 16th. According to reports, after Huang Shaohong returned to Nanjing, he fully clarified the progress and crux of the Beiping peace talks. The demands raised by the Chinese Communists include, in the political aspect, the immediate formation of a joint organization to replace the current government. In the military aspect, they call for the immediate realization of crossing the Yangtze River and proceeding with the reorganization of the armed forces. The government feels considerably troubled by these demands and is currently studying countermeasures. The source stated that the main sticking point in the current peace talks is the issue of crossing the Yangtze River, which is difficult for the government to lightly agree to. The "rule by division along the river" principle proposed by the government aims to achieve a ceasefire on the spot and immediately listen to public opinion through universal suffrage to form a coalition government, and then carry out the reorganization of the army, in order to avoid all unnecessary disputes that may arise before the army is reorganized. If the Communist side insists on the demand to cross the Yangtze River, regardless of the method, the government cannot accept it, and the success or failure of the peace talks hinges on this major key. In the event that this issue cannot be resolved smoothly, the government may publish the details of the peace talks to appeal to the judgment of the people.

[Our News] New York, 16th Broadcast: Hong Kong News: The left-leaning newspaper "Far East Public Report" predicts that the large-scale crossing-the-Yangtze offensive by the Communist army will begin "within two weeks" and states that the result will be unavoidable.

### Huang Shaohong Returned to Nanjing Yesterday to Report: Authorities Convene Meetings to Study Countermeasures

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] After the formal peace talks began, the Chinese Communists proposed 24 detailed clauses based on the eight principles as a concrete plan for implementing the eight conditions, including steps for military reorganization and the organization of a joint government. This plan has been discussed by delegations from both sides and was brought back to Nanjing by Zi Shaohong on the 16th. The government will study this plan and propose countermeasures. Within two or three days, Huang will take the countermeasures back to Beiping to be presented at the meeting for discussion in the hope of reaching an agreement. Furthermore, the formal peace talks held their first and second meetings on the evenings of the 13th and 15th respectively, to discuss the plan.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] Acting President Li held a meeting at his official residence in Fuhougang at 8:00 PM on the 16th, summoning He Yingqin, Zhang Qun, Bai Chongxi, and others. Huang Shaohong reported on the situation of the peace talks in Beiping, and the participants discussed it.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] He Yingqin reported at the Political Affairs Meeting on the 16th, stating: The peace talks have already begun in Beiping and are currently conducting in-depth research on the plan proposed by the Chinese Communists. Government representative Huang Shaohong was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 13th, but the reason for the delay was to await the end of the discussion of the plan before returning to Nanjing to report.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] Government peace talk representative Huang Shaohong and advisor Qu Wu arrived in Nanjing by special plane from Beiping at 2:30 PM on the 16th. Those who greeted them at the airport included Acting President representative Liu Shiyi, President of the Executive Yuan He Yingqin, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan Chen Kewen, Political Affairs Committee member Zhang Qun, and dozens of others. The special plane was the same China Airlines XT-515 that carried Liu Zhongrong and Zhu Yunshan back to Beiping on the 13th, departing from Beiping at 10:43 AM on the 16th. After Huang got off the plane, he was immediately surrounded by a group of reporters. However, during the relentless and tiring questioning, Huang did not reveal a single word about the content of the peace talks, nor did he give a positive response, only repeatedly saying that the weather was very good today, and adding an inscrutable smile. This encirclement lasted for more than ten minutes, but yielded nothing beyond the phrase "good weather." Soon after Huang broke out of the encirclement, he shook hands and exchanged pleasantries with the government officials who had come to greet him and left in the same car with Qu Wu in a very short time. According to what reporters saw, Huang had important documents in his suit pocket, which were exposed at the mouth of the pocket. When Huang was surrounded and crowded, he often probed with his hand, as if they were extremely precious.

[Our News] China Airlines special plane No. 515, carrying government peace talk representative Huang Shaohong back to Nanjing, took off from Beiping at 10:50 AM yesterday, arrived in Nanjing at 2:25 PM, flew to Shanghai at 3:45 PM, and arrived at Longhua Airport at 5:10 PM, carrying a batch of mail. Special plane No. 531, which was sent by the company to carry Yu Youren to Beiping, was still stationed at Longhua yesterday and may fly to Nanjing tomorrow.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] Confirmed news: Third-party figures Zhang Lan, Luo Longji, and others may go to Beiping in the near future. The Chinese Communists have intended to invite them to jointly assist in the peace talks, and the relevant persons have conveyed their opinions. It is also heard that most of the invited persons are in Shanghai, and in addition to Zhang and Luo, Yang Weiyu, Leng Yu, Shi Liang, Ye Duyi, and others are also on the list of invitees.

### The Chinese Communists Highly Tout Urban Policies: Current Moderate Means are to Adapt to Reality: New Democracy is Not the Ultimate Goal

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] When an authoritative person met with our newspaper reporter on the 16th, he spoke freely about the current policies of the Chinese Communists and the political views of Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. Now, we will select the important points and briefly record one or two as follows: The current policy of the Chinese Communists, while highly touting urban policies, has slightly improved its past means of struggle, especially in the recently peacefully completed city of Beiping. The lives of the residents of Beiping are still as peaceful as ever, but according to Zhou Enlai, the Chinese Communist Party is a revolutionary political party and cannot stop its revolution halfway, nor can it compromise casually. Therefore, the current moderate policy is to adapt to the realistic environment, and they deeply feel the need to replace military methods with political methods to avoid bloody struggles. The New Democracy economic policy advocated in Beiping is close to the Democracy in the Three Principles of the People. The difference is that the Chinese Communists do not regard New Democracy as their ultimate goal. On the contrary, they regard New Democracy as their bridge. The person then stated: The current ability of the Chinese Communists to conduct peaceful negotiations with the government is an example of the transformation of the Chinese Communists from struggle methods to achieving revolutionary goals through political means. Mao Zedong has talked about the land reform issue, believing that there are many points that need to be studied and that it is extremely difficult to handle. Mao specifically pointed out that land reform in Jiangnan can only be achieved at least five years later, and within these five years, if it can be achieved by reducing rent and interest, it can be considered satisfactory. The person also stated: It is rumored that the government delegation in Beiping was treated arrogantly by the Chinese Communists, but this is not the case. Except for the fact that Mao, Zhou, and others did not go to greet the government delegation upon their arrival, the hospitality was very thoughtful. Emotionally speaking, old friends, regardless of whether they are Communists or Nationalists, still value friendship, but if they argue over issues, they will get red-faced and not stop.

### The Delegation in Beiping: Living a Busy and Arduous Life

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] It is learned that after the government delegation arrived in Beiping one day, they stayed at the Six Nations Hotel. That night, the Chinese Communist delegation hosted a banquet, and after the banquet, they held a preliminary meeting to discuss the way the peace talks would proceed, which was to first meet individually, exchange opinions widely, and then hold a formal meeting. At the same time, it was decided that neither side would publish any news about the peace talks. From the 2nd, individual contacts began, lasting for as long as eleven days. The first formal meeting did not begin until 8:00 PM on the 13th. The two sides conducted research separately on the 14th. The second meeting was held on the evening of the 15th. The activities of the government delegation in Beiping were generally to contact third-party figures in the morning, hold internal meetings in the afternoon to exchange views, and talk or meet with the Chinese Communist representatives in the evening, which was extremely busy and arduous. When they returned from the Qin Zhengdian (Hall of Diligent Governance) every night, it was always after midnight. Although Beiping has a beautiful spring scenery, the government representatives did not have time to visit. The Chinese Communists provided very thoughtful hospitality, and all expenses were borne by the Chinese Communist side. The government representatives originally brought three boxes of silver coins, intending to pay all the expenses themselves, but because of the hospitality of the Chinese Communists, they used very little.

### Political Affairs Meeting Passes Important Cases: Postal, Telecommunications and Railway Prices to Increase Today: Postal and Telecommunications Increase by 15 Times Overall, Railways Increase by 10 Times Overall

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] The Political Affairs Meeting on the 16th passed the increase in postal, telecommunications, and railway prices, and decided to implement it from the 17th. It is estimated that postal and telecommunications prices will increase by 15 times overall, with ordinary letters increasing from 100 yuan to 1,500 yuan, and ordinary telegrams increasing from 200 yuan per word to 3,000 yuan. Railway prices will increase by 10 times overall, with passenger transport increasing from 40 yuan per kilometer to 400 yuan, and freight transport increasing from 65 yuan per ton per kilometer to 650 yuan. After this adjustment to the new prices, the expenses of postal, telecommunications, and railway enterprises can be covered by 75%, and government subsidies can be reduced accordingly. At the same time, the transportation authorities intend to gradually achieve self-sufficiency. However, in Sichuan and Guizhou provinces, where prices are lower, postal and telecommunications fees will be reduced by 20%. In addition, the meeting discussed the issue of north-south remittances and north-south navigation (aviation), and decided to hand it over to the Ministry of National Defense, Transportation, and Finance for research.

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] The 15th meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 AM on the 16th, chaired by President Tong.

A formal response was sent to the Executive Yuan.

Next, the Budget Committee and the Financial and Economic Committee Jin Shaoxian and others reported on the joint review of the proposal by Yang Yifeng and other members that the salaries of public servants across the country should be reasonably adjusted as soon as possible. It was resolved to be reviewed again and discussed at the next general meeting.

### I Purchased 600,000 Taels of Gold in the United States

[Our Nanjing Correspondent, 16th] Confirmed news: In order to replenish the issuing reserves, the government recently purchased 600,000 taels of gold from the United States.

The 600,000 taels are worth 30 million US dollars, and the government has obtained a profit of 10 million US dollars. In addition to being used as a reserve for the issuance of gold yuan bills, a portion of this gold will be sold on the market to absorb the return of gold yuan bills and reduce issuance.

However, the levy of local taxes by provinces, cities, and counties must be approved by the local people's representative bodies. When the administrative expenses of the central tax collection agencies in local areas exceed 20% of their total revenue, they should be entrusted to local tax collection agencies for handling.

Customs duties shall be paid by purchasing and surrendering Gold Yuan Certificates, which shall not circulate on the market. (5) The price of goods subject to commodity tax shall be based on the wholesale price in the market near the place of production, and the basis for calculating the price shall be specified. If the wholesale price of taxable goods increases or decreases by 25%, the competent tax collection agency shall report to the Ministry of Finance for verification. (6) In the case of profit-seeking enterprise income tax among direct taxes, adopt simultaneous installment methods as much as possible, estimate the tax amount based on the business conditions of various localities and industries, and urge payment to simplify the process. (7) Implement property tax so that the wealthy contribute.

When depositors need to use them, they may sell them to the Central Bank or its designated banks at any time according to the Central Bank's foreign exchange redemption price; (3) The Central Bank should maintain a reasonable market price for foreign exchange transfer certificates to encourage exports and overseas remittances; (4) The import of tobacco and petroleum products shall still maintain the quota allocation method for the time being. The import of grain, cotton, and fertilizers shall be handled by the government separately. For other goods allowed to be imported, merchants may report and transport them for import within the prescribed time limit after obtaining foreign exchange transfer certificates. The types of goods shall be specified and announced by the government from time to time; (5) For goods imported from abroad with self-provided foreign exchange that belong to the types allowed to be imported as stipulated in the preceding article, they may be reported directly to the customs for import. Those belonging to quota allocation and government unified management must first be reported to the import and export management authority for approval.

### Views on the Prospects of Peace Talks

— Qian Nashui

A country that has been plagued by war for more than twenty years and has suffered more than eight years of devastation by foreign enemies has reached the point of extreme social exhaustion. The people of the whole country fully expected that the victory of the War of Resistance would bring peace and happiness; but contrary to their wishes, they were followed by nearly four years of new wars, with the flames of war burning close to half of China north of the Yangtze River. The people in the war zone have suffered greatly from the disaster of artillery fire, families have been destroyed, and lives have been lost, which is unbearable to witness. The people in the non-war zone have also suffered greatly due to frequent supplies. Therefore, everyone has the same heart and the same reason, and they all hope that the war will end immediately and peace will be realized immediately. Two years ago, I personally participated in the peace movement with the greatest enthusiasm and confidence, but the voice of running around and shouting was finally suppressed by the roar of artillery fire, and this movement died young. At present, new peace talks are underway. Based on the eagerness of the people of the whole country to be governed, these peace talks should have a future. Based on the fact that both sides have their own difficulties in continuing the war, these peace talks should also have a future.

The difficulties of the National Government in continuing the war are very clear in terms of military, political, and economic aspects, and there is no need to point them out one by one. What about the Communist Party? In my opinion, the military, political, and economic difficulties are actually not small.

What are the Communist Party's military difficulties?

First, let's look at the problem of crossing the river. After the end of the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, Nanjing was once in a state of extreme panic. This was the best opportunity for the Communist Party to cross the river militarily. However, although the Communist Party won a great victory at that time, it also suffered a great consumption. It would be too risky to carry out the river crossing battle immediately without a period of reorganization and replenishment. Several months of time allowed the Communist army to calmly deploy and arrange the river crossing offensive, and also allowed the government army to step up the deployment and arrangement of defense to hold the river, thus forming the current military stalemate.

The Yangtze River has been known as a natural barrier since ancient times. From a modern perspective, the so-called natural barrier has indeed passed. However, this Yangtze River has no value as a natural barrier to the attacking side with strong naval and air forces, but the value of the natural barrier has not completely disappeared for the Communist Party, which has neither a navy nor an air force. Since the Communist Party has no navy, it cannot move freely on the river. Since it has no air force, it cannot suppress the government's troop supply activities, nor can it cover the impact of a forced crossing. The main tools for the Communist army to cross the river are only wooden boats and the like. It is possible to succeed in secretly crossing the river in small units with slow-moving and limited-capacity wooden boats in areas where the defending troops are weak, but it will be very difficult to gain a foothold on the river bank as a follow-up to continue crossing the river. To effectively cross the river, a large-scale landing operation must be launched to seize important strongholds on the south bank. Large-scale troops exposed on the unprotected river surface provide a clear target for the defending troops' shore-based artillery and warships to fire and aircraft to drop bombs, and the danger can be imagined.

The heavy losses that will be encountered on the river surface in the battle to cross the river are like this, and it is not easy to seize important bridgeheads on the north bank before crossing the river. Generally, the cities along the river are located where there are crossings; the larger the city, the more important the crossing. The Communist army cannot but first attack and seize one or two important bridgeheads on the north bank if it wants to cross the river on a large scale, and Pukou, Anqing, Hankou, and Jingzhou are what it must take. However, some of these strongholds face the river on one side, and some are surrounded by water on two sides. Although the Communist army's attacking spirit is high, it is still unable to complete the encirclement. The closer it gets to the outer periphery of each stronghold, the closer it gets to the range of the defending troops and warships' artillery on both sides of the river. Especially the lake and swamp areas outside Hankou and Jingzhou are not conducive to the large-scale troop movement of the attacking side, and the air force can easily find bombing targets. In the battle to attack and defend important bridgeheads on the north bank, the Communist army will inevitably suffer heavy losses if it wants to accomplish the task of occupying them. The siege of Anqing for more than twenty days without success is an example.

From Jingzhou to Haikou, more than two thousand miles of the Yangtze River, the defending troops need a large number of troops, but the attacking troops need even more troops. The Communist army must use more than one million troops to carry out the battle to cross the river. The millions of troops consumed in the struggle for the north bank bridgeheads and the river surface may reach hundreds of thousands. Moreover, even if the river crossing is successful, it does not necessarily mean that the main force of the government army has been defeated, and it is possible to pacify more than 20 provinces and cities by sending a message. There will be a long period of war in the future. There is a lot of rain in Jiangnan, and the roads are muddy. The rainy season of several months can also make the Communist army feel quite difficult to advance.

The Communist Party occupied so many important cities in a few months, and the rapid military development was really amazing. However, after the military occupation, it must be followed by political digestion, and the time it takes to digest will be much longer than the military occupation. Now, what the Communist Party really needs to work hard on is not new military achievements, but to digest the territory it has already acquired. However, even if the digestion of the territory has achieved results, there is still a difficulty in politics that is the same as the National Government, that is, "joining the army" and "contributing grain" are not necessarily what the people want. The National Government's "conscription" and "grain levy" require the people to give money and lives, and the Communist Party's "joining the army" and "contributing grain" also require the people to give money and lives. They are always unwilling to give money and lives. If the war continues, they cannot but continue to "join the army" and "contribute grain," which can also become a latent political crisis for the CCP. Moreover, after several years of war in the northern provinces, in addition to the deaths and displacements of the population, either A comes to levy or B comes to join the army. The source of soldiers must not be strong, and sometimes it will not be able to meet the needs of front-line replenishment.

War is always unfavorable to the economy. The more than 20 provinces and cities ruled by the National Government can be said to be stable, except for the recent unrest in two or three provinces. The economic situation in these stable areas is already so bad. The areas ruled by the Communist Party have mostly suffered from war, and the economic decline must be even worse. At the same time, the Central Bank's treasury still has tens of thousands of taels of gold and tens of millions of yuan in foreign exchange and silver dollars, but the financial situation is still so chaotic. Even if the Communist Party's People's Bank treasury has gold and silver reserves, it must be far less than this amount. In the past, the political influence was limited to the countryside, and finance was easier to deal with. Now that it has control of several large cities, the situation will be different, and the trend of being stretched will be unavoidable. Continuing the war will only promote the rapid collapse of the economy in the Communist area.

If both sides understand their own difficulties, they will inevitably know that "peace is precious." Therefore, I believe that the peace talks should have a future. The question is how to solve the eight conditions?

I think the purpose of peace should be to seek governance for the country. If it is to seek governance for the country, then all factors that may cause great chaos should be eliminated immediately. Regarding the issue of military reorganization, it is possible to cause great chaos if a little carelessness is not taken. If the reorganization violates the principle of equality, or even if one party is subject to the control of the other, it may cause a great disturbance. The occurrence of this disturbance may also affect the local armed forces. In this way, the result of peace will not only fail to seek governance for the country, but will increase the suffering of the people. The pain at that time will be countless times greater than what everyone has experienced in the past four years. The best way is for the troops of both sides to reorganize themselves in their respective locations at the same time, complete them in stages, and have a joint organization to actually count them.

Secondly, I think the purpose of peace should be to seek peace between the two parties. If it is to seek peace between the two parties, then all factors that may cause resentment should be eliminated immediately. The so-called "war criminals" issue was originally just empty talk, but it stipulated that the responsibility for the war unilaterally belonged to the Kuomintang. This is naturally not a fair statement, nor is it something the Kuomintang is willing to bear. Moreover, the existence of the term "war criminal" will make some people fear that they will be charged with the same crime in the future. I don't think the Communist Party needs to insist on this condition.

The coalition government will also be one of the important issues of contention between the two sides. Many people advocate dividing the north and south along the river, and then uniting them after a period of time. They believe that the Communist Party's "New Democracy" and the Kuomintang's Three Principles of the People are quite similar, but due to the long-term war, mutual trust is difficult to establish suddenly. After the division, the political and economic facilities of each other show increasing closeness, and mutual trust is also increasingly deep. Uniting into one will inevitably become a natural trend. If they gather together and engage in intrigue and mutual exclusion, often making the political situation turbulent and affecting social stability, it is better to temporarily divide and govern. Due to the mutual needs and demands of various aspects, they can still improve their feelings and move towards cooperation, which is conducive to the people. However, whether division is possible, and whether the two sides of the peace talks will turn to this plan because some conditions cannot be agreed upon, I personally do not want to speculate. I can only say that if other conditions cannot be negotiated, being able to take this path first and save the people from the scourge of war is better than fighting.

The international situation is becoming increasingly tense. If we can achieve peace in our country, it will be a great help to the stability of the world. If the war continues, the great fire in the world may start burning from us first. (Shanghai, April 12)

### US Aid of 54 Million US Dollars Preliminary Agreement on Mobilization Plan Half for Purchasing Materials, Half for Agricultural and Industrial Construction

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 16th] After the US Senate and House of Representatives approved the continued use of the remaining US aid of 54 million US dollars by our country, it is now awaiting approval by the House Appropriations Committee and the signature of President Truman before it can be mobilized. The mobilization plan has been preliminarily agreed upon by the US Aid Association and the China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration. After Lapham returns to China, the two sides can make the final decision. In the agreed mobilization plan, half of the 54 million US dollars will be used to purchase materials, most of which will be used to purchase grain, cotton, and gasoline, and a small portion will be used to purchase coal. The other half will be used for rural reconstruction and industrial construction. After the grain purchased with this remaining US aid is transported to China, the grain rationing in the four major cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Shantou will be extended by at least two months. The grain rationing in the four cities was originally scheduled to end at the end of June, but now it can continue to be handled until at least the end of August. According to a certain authoritative person who told reporters on the 16th, the mobilization of this remaining US aid is expected to begin this month.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 16th] Lapham, the director of the China Branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, has set off from the US and returned to China. He has now arrived in San Francisco and is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 21st.

### Chen Cheng Forbids Price Increases for Taiwan Province's Highways and Railways

[Our Taipei Dispatch of the 16th] The Taiwan Provincial Highway and Railway Bureaus recently requested price increases.

### Yarn Factories in Shanghai, Qingdao, and Other Places Feel a Daily Shortage of Raw Cotton

[United Press Washington Dispatch of the 15th] According to the Department of Agriculture, yarn factories along the Chinese coast feel a daily shortage of raw materials. If they do not receive foreign cotton assistance, they will inevitably reduce work in the next five months. Due to the political and military division of China, domestic cotton cannot be transported to the textile centers of Qingdao and Shanghai in large quantities. As of the end of February, the cotton inventory in the coastal area was about 235,000 bales, which can meet the needs of one and a half months. In the second half of the harvest season, coastal yarn factories can continue to obtain about 672,000 bales, which is enough for four and a half months of consumption. In the future, if the yarn factories in Shanghai are forced to close down due to a shortage of raw materials or military instability, one million people will be directly unemployed, and indirect unemployed people are not included.

Yan Wu, the commander of the Yuanling Garrison, leads the newly established Yuanling local troops, the Fifth Security Brigade, to take charge of the defense on the south bank. According to a senior official of the Pacification Office who spoke to reporters, the rebel troops are a rabble. The last time they were lost was purely due to improper command. This time is far from the last time. The commander is General Du Ding, a famous general who defended Changde during the War of Resistance. He has rich combat experience and the rebel troops will never succeed. Also, according to the Pacification Office, Chen Quzhen's name is entirely borrowed by Wang Yuanhua, Cao Zhenya, and others to make a call. It is neither Chen's original intention, and Chen has no action in Fenghuang. Everyone expects Chen to be able to preserve his integrity in his later years.

### In Response to the Atlantic Pact, Eastern Europe Completes a Grand Alliance Aimed at Preventing Aggression from Germany or Its Allies

[Our Dispatch] New York Broadcast, 16th: Prague Dispatch: The two allied countries of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe have completed a large-scale "military agreement network," integrating all of Eastern Europe with the Soviet Union. When the Czech Republic and Hungary signed a military agreement in Budapest this afternoon, they issued a statement accusing "Western imperialist countries of concluding the North Atlantic Treaty, intending to revive fascist Germany and threaten world peace." The Czech-Hungarian agreement was signed by Czechoslovakia's Česlav Cipotek and Hungarian Prime Minister Dobi. According to reports, the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries have separately concluded such agreements, and Eastern European countries have also mutually concluded such agreements. The Czech-Hungarian agreement is the twenty-first of such agreements. From now on, the Soviet Union, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia have all concluded bilateral agreements, forming a whole. If Yugoslavia's Tito can abide by his promises, then in the future, if any of the seven countries in the Eastern bloc believe that they have been "threatened" by Germany or a "country directly or indirectly allied with Germany," they will all take unified action to resist it.

[United Press, Budapest, 15th] The Communist Youth Daily criticized "American capitalists" on the 15th for obstructing the task entrusted to Tito by the "People's Republic." Hungarian Communist Party editor Li Weiae wrote in the newspaper that Tito and his group "have become subordinates of American imperialists, in the same position as Bevin, Blum, Gasperi, Mintzenty, and de Gaulle." He stated, "The current task entrusted to Tito by the United States is to obstruct the people's democratic countries, especially Bulgaria, Albania, and Hungary. The Tito regime is actually an informal fellow traveler of the North Atlantic Treaty."

[Agence France-Presse, Budapest, 16th] Hungary and Czechoslovakia signed a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance here this morning. This treaty is practically similar to all the treaties signed earlier between the democratic countries of Eastern Europe. The main purpose is to prevent German aggression. However, the treaty also recalls that the relationship between Hungary and Czechoslovakia in the past was very tense, and now the two governments must work hard to change it into one of mutual reliance and friendship. The treaty also declares that the two countries must take all appropriate measures to prevent an attack on the two countries by Germany or its allies. If one of the contracting parties goes to war with Germany or its allies, the other party must provide military or other assistance with all the resources at its disposal. Neither contracting party may make any alliance against the other party or participate in any actions against the other contracting party with other countries. The contracting parties shall fulfill actions to maintain peace that are consistent with the Charter of the United Nations.

### Kolarov Succeeds as Bulgarian Prime Minister; Two Romanian Deputy Prime Ministers Dismissed; Ms. Pauker and Loka Fill the Vacancies

[Reuters, London, 15th] Sofia Radio announced today that Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kolarov has been appointed Chairman of the Bulgarian Council of Ministers (i.e., Prime Minister). Kolarov is one of the leaders of the Bulgarian Communist Party. In past Bulgarian official documents, he has been referred to as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers (Deputy Prime Minister). Another Deputy Prime Minister, Kostov, was recently dismissed for "committing serious political and anti-party errors." A U.S. State Department spokesman said today that he believes Dimitrov's trip to the Soviet Union means that he has broken away from government and party affairs. This move may also reveal some new background to the recent purge of Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Kostov and other Bulgarian Communist Party members.

According to reports, Kolarov was elected Chairman of the Bulgarian National Assembly in December 1945. In September 1946, he took over as the temporary President of the Bulgarian Republic. In November of the same year, he was re-elected Chairman of the Bulgarian Republic Presidium and was immediately entrusted with forming a cabinet by Dimitrov. In December 1947, he nominated Georgiev as Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. Soon after, Naichev succeeded him as Chairman of the Bulgarian National Assembly.

[United Press, Bucharest, 16th] Romania replaced two of its three deputy prime ministers on the 16th, awarding one of the positions to Communist Party giant Ms. Pauker. Ms. Pauker, who was trained in Moscow and has been regarded as one of the most important Communist Party members in the Balkans, has now been promoted one level in the Romanian government's line of succession. The Presidium of the Romanian People's Republic appointed Ms. Pauker to succeed Agriculture Minister Savulescu as Second Deputy Prime Minister, and appointed the Minister of Finance to succeed Culture Minister Voitec as Third Deputy Prime Minister.

Ms. Pauker has been influential in guiding Romanian affairs since returning to Romania with the Soviet army in 1944, but she did not join the government until she was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs on November 7, 1947. A few months later, King Michael fled the country, and Romania became a People's Republic. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party merged to form the New Workers' Party. She is expected to retain her position as Minister of Foreign Affairs in her new position as Second Deputy Prime Minister.

[United Press, London, 15th] The internal crisis caused by the Stalin-Tito dispute is today focused on the withdrawal of the old Bolshevik revolutionary Dimitrov from the Bulgarian political scene. Dimitrov was originally Prime Minister and Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party. This trip to the Soviet Union for a "return home vacation" is actually the most recent of several actions in the dispute between Soviet satellite countries. These satellite countries have been greatly troubled by the ideological conflict between Stalin and Tito. There is no evidence to be found as to the motives for the further changes of key figures in Eastern European countries, and perhaps it will not be known what their intentions are until weeks or even months later. However, it is generally known that infighting within Bulgaria has always been unceasing since the deterioration of relations between Stalin and Tito. The Bulgarian Communist Party has had great difficulty in discussing a policy to deal with Tito because there are many factions within the party vying for personal power and ideological principles. Kostov, although known for his moderate handling of his country's communist theories, once led the attack on people who supported Tito. Dimitrov has not publicly mentioned Kostov since Kostov's disgrace was announced by the party, which may provide a clue to recent developments.

### Smith Talks About Stalin, Believing That He Is Physically Robust and Seems to Be in Good Health

Smith replied to a radio interviewer's question, saying: I don't think Stalin is seriously ill. He is extremely physically robust and seems to be in good health now.

### Bevin Returns to England Carrying Confidential Documents

[Reuters, Southampton, 15th] Foreign Minister Bevin arrived here from the United States today aboard the "Mauretania" liner, carrying several confidential and important documents hidden in steel boxes. They were transported by special plane from Washington to here and were to be opened by Bevin immediately after arriving in England. However, because the key to the steel box was not brought with the plane, Bevin summoned the ship's engineer to break the steel box and take out the documents.

[United Press, Southampton, 15th] Foreign Minister Bevin said today upon arriving here that he "still firmly believes that the Atlantic Pact is the most significant step taken in maintaining post-war peace." He continued, "But it will still take considerable time to resolve many world problems."

### The United States, Britain, and France Will Thoroughly Study the Future Status of West Germany; Opportunities for a Four-Power Agreement Are Still Not Abandoned

[Reuters, London, 15th] The future status of West Germany will be one of the main topics discussed by the leaders of Britain, the United States, and France in Berlin and the capitals of the three countries during the Easter holidays. For a week, the three foreign ministers have successively resolved the three thorny issues of the West German occupation regulations, the establishment of the West German government, the administrative agencies of the three zones, and the dismantling of West German factories. However, the publication of these three agreements has raised two other issues.

First, the dispute between the German Christian Democratic Union and the Social Democratic Party over West Germany's basic laws and constitution. Reliable sources say that the Social Democratic Party's refusal to modify the West German draft constitution according to the occupying powers' opinions is not enough to show its final attitude. It is generally believed that the Social Democratic Party will eventually succumb to Allied pressure and abandon the draft constitution it proposed itself when it meets in Gozburg next Wednesday. However, these developments will inevitably leave unpleasant traces on future cooperation between German political parties and the Allied powers. Another major issue is the Soviet Union's attitude and the future status of Berlin caused by the announcement of the West German agreement. There have been widespread rumors in recent days that the Soviet Union has begun to explore the possibility of lifting the Berlin blockade and convening a four-power foreign ministers' meeting to discuss the entire German issue. British officials have denied that the Soviet government has made such overtures to Britain, but it is not yet known whether the Soviet Union has made overtures to the United States and France. U.S. Military Governor of Germany Clay said that there is no evidence to prove that the Berlin blockade can be lifted. However, when Secretary of State Acheson was asked about this matter, he only gave a vague answer. The official opinion of the Western countries is that the establishment of the West German government, the merger of the three zones of West Germany, and other reforms do not prevent the possibility of reaching an agreement with the Soviet Union in the end, but it is also admitted that it will be more difficult to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union after the West German government takes power. Therefore, the weeks before the West German government is established are also the last opportunity to reach a four-power agreement. If this opportunity is not seized, the Berlin problem will continue to exist.

### In Order to Win Over the German People, the Soviet Union May Order Poland to Return German Territory; Belgium Temporarily Suspends Receiving German Border Territory

[United Press, Berlin, 16th] Western diplomatic circles have received news that the Soviet Union may order Poland to return part of Lower Silesia to Germany. Western officials said that this move attempts to rebuild some of the prestige lost by the Soviet Union and the Communist Party in Germany. If this plan is realized, Poland will return part of the industrial area of Lower Silesia to Germany.

[United Press, Brussels, 15th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced tonight that Belgium is temporarily suspending the reception of German borderland that the Western occupying countries recently stipulated should be ceded. This cession totals 52 square miles and is all on the West German border.

### Formally Breaks Away from British Imperial Rule: South Ireland Declares Itself a Republic; Northern Ireland's Border Is Heavily Guarded to Prevent Unrest

[United Press, Dublin, 16th] South Ireland officially became a free republic today, the final step in 780 years of opposition to British imperial rule. The republic's founding ceremony will be held in front of the General Post Office building, where the Easter Revolution's bloody tragedy occurred 33 years ago, also with the aim of seeking independence.

[Reuters, Belfast, 15th] The Northern Ireland government has ordered strict security measures to be taken over the weekend to prevent possible unrest, paying particular attention to the entry of Irish Republican Army personnel into Northern Ireland. On Monday, the day of the transfer of power, the Irish Anti-Partition League plans to hold demonstrations demanding Irish unity at the border between Northern and Southern Ireland. The Northern Ireland authorities will intensify patrols along the border at that time.

### The UN General Assembly Meeting Still Requires Four Weeks; Israel's Admission to the UN Can Only Be Realized in September

[Our Dispatch] New York Broadcast, 16th: Lake Success Dispatch: The issue of Israel's admission to the United Nations may be postponed until the regular session of the UN General Assembly in mid-September before it is approved. The UN General Assembly decided to submit Israel's application for membership to the Political Committee for discussion, mainly because most representatives obviously wanted to force Israel to make concessions on the internationalization of the Holy Land and the Arab refugee issue. The Holy Land Mediation Committee's report on these two issues will have to be delayed until September before it can be submitted. The Arab representatives will probably argue that Israel's admission to the UN should not wait until those two issues have been resolved before it is approved. It is expected that the meeting will continue for at least four more weeks. In addition to discussing the issue of Israel's admission to the UN, it will also discuss the issue of the disposal of former Italian colonies, the issue of the treatment of Indian residents in South Africa, and the issue of the Franco regime in Spain.

### Peace Conference Representatives: France Restricts Entry; The French Women's Association Expresses Opposition

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 15th] The French Women's Association today opposed the French government's restriction on the issuance of entry passports to representatives of certain foreign countries, especially the Soviet Union and China, who will participate in the World Peace Congress to be held in Paris on April 20. The Preparatory Committee of the World Peace Congress issued a statement today, stating that the National Office of the French Women's Association is making every effort to oppose the French government's move, saying that this arbitrary plan proves that the French government is hostile to the Soviet Union and the people of the people's democratic countries and China. The French government is attempting to prevent the people of these countries from expressing their desire for peace, so it has now asked the French government to allow the representatives of these countries to enter France. Other French leftist organizations also oppose the French government's restriction on the issuance of entry passports to the representatives.

The passage of the bill by the Senate is expected to be inevitable. After the bill is passed by the parliament, Japan will have its first balanced budget since the war.

### Iran, Under Soviet Pressure, Plans to Appeal to the Security Council; Article 6 of the Soviet-Iranian Treaty Is Not Applicable

[Our Dispatch] Washington Broadcast, 16th: The Iranian Embassy recently denied the claim that the 1921 Soviet-Iranian Treaty was signed under duress. The Iranian Embassy stated that the Iranian government only cancelled Article 6 of the treaty, which stipulates that the Soviet Union may send troops to Iran under certain circumstances. The Iranian Embassy stated that Article 105 of the UN Charter stipulates that for the purpose of enabling UN agencies to carry out their missions, member states should provide the agencies with various necessary privileges. Therefore, Article 6 of the Soviet-Iranian Treaty is no longer applicable.

[United Press, Tehran, 15th] It was learned here today that Iran has notified the Soviet Union, stating that if the Soviet Union does not ease its pressure on Iran, Iran will appeal to the UN Security Council. Reliable sources say that Iran has asked the Soviet ambassador, who left for Moscow this morning, to inform the Soviet government of this.

### European Socialization of Medicine Movement

The cost of medical care is so high that it is beyond the means of ordinary people. Most European countries have adopted a system of free consultation at hospitals and doctors' offices, with all expenses covered by the state.

[United Press London, 16th] Doctors in Europe have been gradually trending towards socialization in the past twenty years. Public and private health insurance plans are very common, and an increasing number of doctors are participating in organized social services. However, in terms of the scale of such plans, no country except the Soviet Union can compete with the United Kingdom. In the UK, everyone can receive free treatment. There are three main reasons for the medical socialization movement: the people's hope for social and economic security promotes the universality of treatment; the advancement of medicine over the past fifty years has resulted in sophisticated equipment and high costs, which are beyond the means of ordinary people; and after the war, Europe lacked doctors and medicines, and the distribution was uneven in many countries, especially in rural agricultural countries.

Some health plans are compulsory, while others are limited to specific salaried classes. Many countries adopted forms of medical socialization as early as the mid-19th century, with their protection plans originating from labor unions. Compulsory plans organized by the government are largely the product of post-war political thought, especially in Eastern European countries. In 1948, the United Kingdom implemented a national health service. Initially, the 1911 National Insurance Act only stipulated that funding would come from tax revenue. Only those with an income of less than $1,680 were eligible for insurance, preventing diseases, accounting for about half of the national population.

According to a United Press survey of fifteen European countries, the general situation of medical socialization is as follows:

Norway—Employees with an income of less than 9,000 Norwegian kroner per year are required by law to participate in health insurance, accounting for about 80% of the total population. Employers pay one-sixth of the insurance premium on their behalf, and the rest is borne by the employee. Those with higher incomes can choose whether to participate in insurance. Patients are free to choose a doctor, and consultation fees are used under the insurance plan, with the cost of medicine paid out-of-pocket. Regulations also stipulate doctor's consultation fees: 5 Norwegian kroner for the initial consultation and 4 kroner for each follow-up visit. Specialist consultation fees are 10 kroner.

Sweden—The government is scheduled to implement a compulsory health insurance law from July 1, 1950, with funding from official appropriations or special taxes. The parliament is currently reviewing a comprehensive health plan that stipulates that all doctors in the country should be employed by the government for a period of about ten years. There are a total of 651 hospitals in Sweden, of which only 13 are privately owned. Medical treatment is completely free for the poor, and partially free for other patients.

Denmark—Since 1932, people over the age of 17 have been required to have insurance, paying 75 Danish kroner per year until their income reaches the government's prescribed limit. During this period, they can choose their own doctor and change it once a year. Insurance costs are waived. Most hospitals are managed by the central or local government.

Poland—Medical socialization began in 1945. Doctors are responsible for treating workers in state-owned enterprises for at least five hours a day, receiving a monthly salary of 30,000 Polish złoty from the Ministry of Health. They can practice privately after completing their public duties. Poland currently has 8,000 physicians and surgeons, compared to 14,500 before the war. The total population of the country is about 24 million.

Czechoslovakia—Since July 1948, 95% of the national population has participated in health insurance and received free medical treatment. Workers pay about 3% of their wages for insurance, while shop assistants pay 4% to 5%. The deficit is subsidized by the national treasury, and all hospitals are state-owned.

Hungary—Handicraft workers have been required to have insurance since 1927, with the insured person paying 1% of medical expenses and the employer paying 12%. Doctors' salaries are limited, but they work very hard. The government is now planning to expand the compulsory insurance system to the entire population.

Bulgaria—Since the government implemented a state-run health plan, the medical services received by the people have greatly improved compared to the past private doctors.

Romania—Since January 1, 1949, 1.5 million members of various trade unions and their families, totaling about 4 million people, can receive free medical treatment, but 85% of Romania's total population are farmers, and farmers are not yet included in the scope of the health insurance law.

Germany—After Prime Minister Bismarck proposed the social insurance law in 1879, compulsory health insurance was implemented. Until 1945, all workers with a monthly salary of less than 300 marks participated. This plan is largely implemented throughout West Germany, but there have been slight changes in Berlin, with medicine costs waived and each outpatient visit costing 5 marks. Patients can receive X-rays for a limited number of times during a certain period.

Soviet Union—All medicine is socialized. People can freely seek medical treatment an unlimited number of times, whether at home or in the hospital. Doctors' salaries and hospital operating expenses are all provided by the state. The total budget for 1948 stipulated health expenditures of over 20 billion rubles, which, according to official prices, is about 4 billion US dollars.

France—Those with a monthly salary of less than 19,000 French francs pay 6% of the insurance premium, and the employer pays 4%. Excellent doctors can enjoy the same medical treatment as hospitals and department heads. They should attend to patients in the hospital every morning, and the consultation fee is determined by the hospital based on the patient's income. They can take on private business at other times.

Italy—The most important state-run medical organization is funded by employer donations, accounting for 5% of each worker's monthly salary. Workers do not pay, but they and their families can be hospitalized for 180 days each year. Doctors in the hospital each manage 2,000 to 4,000 patients. Whether they treat patients or not, the hospital pays each doctor 270 to 340 lire per patient, which is about 47 to 60 US cents, based on the number of patients.

Spain—Since 1942, about 16 million people have enjoyed free medical treatment benefits under the health insurance plan, including employees with a monthly salary of less than 1,000 Spanish pesetas and their families. The plan is managed by the Ministry of Labor. Employees pay 6% of their monthly salary for insurance, and the employer pays the same amount, with the rest being subsidized by the government.

Portugal—State-run or municipal hospitals waive all or part of medical expenses based on the patient's income. Large factories hire their own doctors to provide free medical treatment to workers. Last year, the government paid a total of 28,988,800 Portuguese escudos to supplement the insufficient funds of various hospitals, equivalent to 2,174,100 US dollars.

Belgium—There is no socialization plan yet, but 1.9 million workers are registered under the social security law to participate in disease prevention insurance. Treatment costs are borne by the individual, and a portion may be reimbursed afterward depending on the situation.

### Secretary-General Chen of the Municipal Government Holds a Talk Session; Decision on Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices Expected Tomorrow; Source of Rice and Fuel Guaranteed Without Worry

[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Liang, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, invited responsible persons from various newspapers in the city to a discussion at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 3 PM yesterday. More than 20 people attended, including Pan Gongzhan and Cheng Cangbo. Secretary-General Chen first delivered a speech, stating: (1) The most important issue facing Shanghai today is the price problem. Regarding how to suppress and stabilize prices, I exchanged opinions with Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun on the evening of the 15th. Minister Liu went to Beijing on the evening of the 16th to discuss effective countermeasures with the Central Government regarding the current financial and monetary control measures. A concrete decision will be made after he returns to Shanghai tomorrow (the 18th). (2) Preparations are underway to stabilize rice prices through public funds, and the source of rice can be guaranteed without worry. Recently, the municipal authorities have reached a general agreement with the Economic Cooperation Administration, and have ordered 45,000 tons from overseas. On the domestic front, it is planned to purchase another 600,000 shi. From July onwards, the ECA will continue to supply rationed rice, and the issue of rice sources has been resolved. (3) Regarding fuel, the issue of flour exchange for coal should be resolved within half a month. Taiwan exports 70,000 tons of coal per month to supply South China and the Beijing-Shanghai area. Fuel should not become a problem. Imported coal purchased within two months will be exempt from taxes. (4) Regarding how to maintain industry and commerce, the municipal authorities have successively established a Factory Raw Material and Finished Product Purchasing and Sales Design Committee and a North-South Material Exchange Design Committee to solve the difficulties of industry and commerce, and have appointed the Industry Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as design committee members. This move will greatly help the smooth flow of materials in this city. (5) Regarding the student movement, the government has decided to take guidance and persuasion as the principle, adhering to the aim of caring for students and safeguarding education, and providing guidance day and night, and instructing the military and police to only maintain order and generally not retaliate. (6) The municipal finances and economy are tight. Due to currency depreciation, some taxes are not timely and the income is almost zero. The municipal government's income and expenditure are far apart, and it is determined to strive for gradual improvement. Subsequently, the responsible persons of various newspapers successively expressed their opinions, and the meeting adjourned at about 5 o'clock.

### Pan Gongzhan Suggests Issuing Local Currency

At the meeting, Pan Gongzhan and others requested the Central Government to approve the issuance of local currency to alleviate the current economic crisis. Pan stated that the people have lost faith in the gold yuan issued by the Central Bank. If the Ministry of Finance can approve several commercial banks to issue local currency by depositing sufficient reserves, then credit can be better. However, the key lies in whether the Central Bank can allocate the issuance authority to commercial banks. Yan Esheng stated that experts had previously studied the issuance of local currency, which cannot be implemented without the support of the Central Government. As for reserves, the Central Bank has already exchanged all of them when it redeemed gold and silver last time. It may be possible to use materials such as gauze as reserves, and the commercial banks can jointly form a joint reserve committee to manage the reserves and manage the issuance. Secretary-General Chen expressed great approval of the above suggestions, stating that after Minister Liu returns to Shanghai on Monday, he will convene responsible persons from local governments and various legal entities to discuss the central government's economic decisions brought back this time, and will propose them, and hope that the Senate will invite leaders from all walks of life to jointly discuss this issue.

### Yangtze River Freight Insurance Squad Established Yesterday; Highest Insurance Premium Charged is 4%

The Property Insurance Department of the Central Trust Bureau started providing Yangtze River freight war risk insurance yesterday, which is denominated in foreign currency. However, this foreign currency insurance method is limited to export materials. However, because foreign currency is still prohibited from free trading, all are settled with foreign exchange transfer certificates. The rate for the payment of insurance premiums was announced by the department yesterday as follows: (1) The entire Yangtze River route, from Chongqing to Shanghai, charges 4% of the insured amount. (2) The upper reaches of the Yangtze River, from Chongqing to Wanxian, charge 0.5% of the insured amount. (3) The middle reaches of the Yangtze River, from Wanxian to Hankou, charge 2% of the insured amount. (4) The lower reaches of the Yangtze River, from Hankou to Shanghai, charge 4% of the insured amount. According to the person in charge of the department, in light of the recent ceasefire talks, cargo ships that were stranded near Jiujiang a few days ago will continue to arrive in Shanghai for export, most of which are tung oil, lard, and other materials. Therefore, it is said that there will be more people applying for war risk insurance recently.

### Air Freight Rates Adjusted Today; Increase of 470%

### Water and Land Public Transportation Ticket Prices Adjusted Today

Various water and land public transportation companies in this city have experienced an excessive increase in prices recently, especially the prices of gasoline, coal, and foreign exchange, which are the main costs, have soared wildly. The ticket revenue is too far from the actual expenditure, and they are all on the verge of being unable to maintain operations. They have successively submitted requests to the competent authorities to re-adjust the new prices according to the mid-month index to alleviate the emergency. Yesterday, the Public Works Bureau invited representatives from the Senate to jointly review and confirm that this was indeed the case, and it was approved by the Municipal Government and implemented today (the 17th). After this adjustment, the public bus fares are 1,500, 2,300, 3,000, 3,500, and 4,000 yuan. Tram first class is 1,500, 2,100, 2,600, 3,200, and 3,600 yuan. Third class is 1,000, 1,400, 1,700, 2,100, and 2,400 yuan. Ferry is 1,500 yuan.

[Another Dispatch] The soaring prices of gasoline, coal, and foreign exchange have greatly affected the expenditures of various public transportation companies. According to statistics from the Municipal Public Transportation Company, the average daily ticket revenue from April 1 to 15 was approximately 85 million yuan. Only the expenditure on gasoline alone, based on the total ticket revenue, requires a loss of more than 10%. According to statistics from British and French companies, the losses in March were as high as 3 billion yuan due to price increases. In addition, the number of passengers without tickets has increased sharply recently, accounting for more than 53% of all passengers. The various companies have successively submitted requests to the competent authorities to seek effective solutions to maintain their survival.

### Chen Daqing Hosts Reporters to Discuss Economic and Security Issues

Security Forces Organized by Some Schools Should be Banned · ID Cards from Areas North of the Yangtze River are Invalid

[Reported by this newspaper] Songhu Garrison Commander Chen Daqing hosted reporters in the conference room of the headquarters at 10:00 AM yesterday, and made the following remarks on the city's economic and security issues: (1) The city's economic situation has been extremely serious recently. Prices have been jumping several times a day. The lives of citizens are on the verge of desperation, and social security has been greatly affected. Commander-in-Chief Tang and Minister Liu Gongyun have exchanged views on economic issues many times, and will immediately convene an emergency meeting to discuss ways to curb the runaway prices after Minister Liu returns to Shanghai. Positive efforts will be made to secure sources of key materials such as rice and coal, and illegal activities such as speculation, manipulation, and monopoly will be strictly prohibited. In particular, the recent surge in silver dollars and the speculators who are stirring up trouble in the market, and there are also people manipulating behind the scenes, are currently under strict investigation and will be completely banned. (2) Recently, some students from several schools have been engaged in illegal activities on campus after their off-campus parades and other activities were banned, such as organizing security forces, some of whom even use weapons and build fortifications. This kind of action is indeed childish and ridiculous, and has absolutely no legal basis. If they are doing this for safety, then the garrison command has the responsibility to protect public security, and can send troops to protect them if necessary. Therefore, this kind of activity should be banned and disbanded by the school authorities, otherwise the school will be blockaded or other measures will be taken to maintain public security. (3) The city's population is complex, and general surveys and statistics are not very accurate, resulting in many homicide and theft cases in recent months that are difficult to solve. A decision has been made to rectify this. In addition to the fixed households residing in the urban area being thoroughly investigated by the municipal government, for the floating population, the Jinghu-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters will propose to the central government that all passengers on ships, vehicles, and airplanes must purchase tickets with their ID cards, and after arriving at their destinations, they must also stay in hotels with their ID cards. ID cards from all areas north of the Yangtze River will be invalid from now on. (4) Regarding the release of political prisoners, the department has not yet received a formal order. Chen believes that everything should still depend on how the peace talks progress. If the peace talks are successful, there is no need to detain them any longer. During the current peace talks, this is not an urgent issue to be resolved.

### The Rumor That Chen Daqing and Shi Jue Would be Swapped Has Become a Thing of the Past

[Reported by this newspaper] Chen Daqing will continue to serve as the Songhu Garrison Commander, and the rumor that Chen would be swapped with Shi Jue, the deputy commander of the Jinghu-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters, has become a thing of the past. This is because the authorities, in view of the complex situation in this city, intend to divide public security work from military defense. In the future, Commander Chen will be solely responsible for social security. Shi Jue will be ordered to take charge of military defense in the Zhejiang-Shanghai area.

### Consultations Among Authorities; Decisive Measures

[Our Report] In recent days, the general prices in this city have once again risen wildly and in a straight line. Especially after the release of the mid-month cost of living index, almost every commodity has risen by 50% to 100% daily. The lives of ordinary citizens have been forced to the brink of survival. According to reliable sources: The city's security authorities have decided to consult with the financial authorities on emergency measures starting next week. It is said that these measures may be similar to the policies implemented during the currency reform last autumn, and their implementation will inevitably deal the most severe blow to various speculative markets, in order to wipe out this surging and unextinguished price inflation in one fell swoop. These decisive measures could have been implemented immediately, but because Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun has gone to Beijing, the outcome will be seen as soon as Liu returns to Shanghai.

### Gold Control Bureau Divided into Six Groups for Inspection; Responsibility for Deducting Wages Paid in Cash

[Our Report] The Central Bank issued more than 30 billion yuan in cash to various banks and financial institutions on the 15th for distribution to factories to pay employees' wages. However, some factories did not receive the money on that day, and disputes arose among employees demanding payment, leading some to suspect that the banks and financial institutions were diverting these funds for speculation. Secretary-General Chen of the municipal government instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate thoroughly. Yesterday, the Gold Control Bureau dispatched personnel in six groups to inspect various banks and financial institutions. The Police Bureau participated in four groups, and the Social Affairs Bureau participated in two groups. According to Director Cao of the Social Affairs Bureau: This inspection aims to clarify who is responsible for suppressing and diverting the funds. If the factory did not send someone to collect the money, the responsibility lies with the factory. If the factory sent someone to collect the money, but the bank or financial institution deliberately made it difficult to issue the money, the fault lies with the bank or financial institution. After a thorough investigation, the full situation will be announced.

### Cash for Wage Payments at Factories to be Collected by Labor Unions; Banks and Financial Institutions to Deposit Every Other Day; National Bank Issues Half of Cash

[Our Report] Yesterday, the Central Bank improved the method of issuing cash in order to ensure that cash for wage payments reaches the hands of manufacturers directly. The method was changed to have the industrial unions contact the relevant banks and financial institutions, issue checks from the banks and financial institutions to the Central Bank, and then have the industrial unions endorse them before collecting the cash directly from the cashier's department of the National Bank. The total amount of cash collected by the industrial unions yesterday was 30 billion yuan out of the 70 billion yuan that was agreed upon. The order of the cash collection process was generally good. Occasionally, some factories did not go through the industrial unions to collect cash directly from the National Bank. The National Bank also accommodated and issued cash to them uniformly. However, according to the relevant authorities of the bank, it is hoped that manufacturers will still have the industrial unions collect the remaining 40 billion yuan in cash to be issued on Monday (i.e., tomorrow) in order to save time and procedures and to ensure that the allocated 70 billion yuan in cash can be issued on the 16th and 18th as scheduled. Furthermore, if the industrial unions' cash allocation for the 16th has not been received due to unclear procedures, it can be included in the 18th for collection.

In addition to issuing 30 billion yuan in cash to the industrial unions yesterday, the National Bank also issued 5% (i.e., half) of the cash to each bank and financial institution based on their bi-daily deposit balance to meet the needs of their clients. As for the various state-owned enterprises and institutions that directly interact with the National Bank, the National Bank still issued 30% of the cash based on their balance yesterday. For those without special needs, the bank will still provide appropriate leniency based on the actual situation.

### Financial Industry Issues Statement on the Issue of Issuing New Cash

[Our Report] Responsible persons from the Banking, Money Exchange, and Trust Association, regarding the report that factories were paying wages and the National Bank was issuing cash that was being used by banks and financial institutions who were failing to keep their promises, resulting in manufacturers not receiving the money, issued a statement on the actual situation, stating: The issue of factories paying wages this period, due to the cash shortage, had been discussed in advance by the relevant agencies more than once. The banking and financial industry is in an intermediary position and naturally wants to consider the needs of manufacturers who are their clients. During the group meeting on the 13th, it was discussed that the checks for wage payments during this period should be endorsed by the industry unions to distinguish them from other clients, so that manufacturers could use them to collect cash. However, this point was not clearly stipulated during the meeting at the Central Bank the next day, and it was suggested that the wage payments during this period should be handled exclusively by designated banks, which would be clearer, but this was not adopted. The Central Bank authorities only stated that 90 billion yuan in cash would be issued within three days starting from the 15th, which is about 30 billion yuan per day. According to the industry's usual deposits in the Central Bank, it is roughly estimated to be around 100 billion yuan. Calculating 30 billion yuan per day, it is only slightly less than 30%, which is not much more than the usual amount of cash collected. Moreover, the deposits of each bank and financial institution in the Central Bank vary, and the clients of the banks and financial institutions are not limited to manufacturers, so they cannot refuse other clients' withdrawals. With procedures not yet finalized and handling inconsistent, how can there be a failure to keep promises? Taking the cash received on the 15th alone, it was only 20%. Excluding the 10% for fixed-amount promissory notes, the cash received by each bank and financial institution must be issued under such a severe cash shortage and cannot be retained. Moreover, the banks and financial institutions do not have the resources to hoard this cash, and the banks have long-standing relationships with manufacturers, knowing their urgent need for cash, so how can there be a reason to deliberately make things difficult for them? This kind of misunderstanding is not factual. Therefore, if the manufacturers who are clients of the banks and financial institutions have any questions, they can only investigate the facts. The allegation that banks and financial institutions are profiting from the cash premium is an illegal act and can only be reported to the Gold Control Bureau for legal action. The true situation is hereby clarified.

### Director Cao Investigates Rice Prices; New Measures Expected on Monday

[Our Report] Yesterday, rice prices rose wildly, with retail prices approaching the one million yuan mark per dan. The north and south rice markets were closed all day. A reporter interviewed Director Cao of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday. According to him, personnel have been dispatched to investigate the situation of rice price speculation and are currently collecting data. He has requested instructions from Secretary-General Chen, and a new measure will be introduced on the 18th. He also stated that the city's rice reserves are sufficient and will not be lacking. The government has control of two-thirds of the city's food supply, so there will be no problem with the allocation of household rice.

### Two Convicts for Robbery in Gangs Sentenced to One Year Each

### Fires in Nanshi and Western Shanghai; Careless Use of Gunpowder Factory Endangers Several Shanties

[Our Report] A residence of a certain family at No. 16-18 Wan'an Street, Old North Gate, caught fire at around 7:30 AM yesterday. Flames soared into the sky, and the fire department and fire brigades from various districts in the city rushed to the scene with pump trucks to put out the fire. It took about an hour to extinguish the fire. In addition to burning down the residence at that number, it also affected the neighboring No. 20. Fortunately, there were no casualties. It was later found that the fire was caused by carelessness while cooking breakfast. The kitchen of the Yilong Gunpowder Factory at No. 1188 Lane, Kaixuan Road, Western Shanghai, reported a fire at around 4:30 PM yesterday, which spread to the Huakang Electric Pole Factory at No. 1174 next door. Several fire belt trucks from the fire department rushed to the scene to put out the fire. However, the fire spread rapidly, and in an instant, it endangered several shanties from No. 1113 to No. 1121. It took an hour and a half to control the fire. It is estimated that three-quarters of the Yilong Factory, one-half of the Huakang Factory, and five grass sheds were burned down. The police station in charge later ordered an investigation into the cause of the accident.

### Battle for the Bridgehead in Northern Jiangsu: Ensuring the Natural Barrier of the Yangtze River

— Our Correspondent, He Xianglin

[Our Correspondent, Zhenjiang, 14th] The flames of war are burning ever closer to the opposite bank of the river. The Yangtze River, known as a natural barrier, is now facing a historic test. Zhenjiang, in these few days, has drawn the keen attention of the people nationwide because it is the shield for Nanjing and Shanghai, and its advance or retreat will have a tremendous impact on the overall situation. From the 6th to the 10th of this month, the sounds of artillery fire across the river have been incessant, shaking the glass windows and objects in the houses.

The Fate of Yizheng

This time, the large-scale offensive launched by the communist forces in northern Jiangsu, in addition to being determined to take Yidun, the only isolated city in Jiangbei, has two meanings: on the one hand, to act as a pioneer for peace talks, to facilitate bargaining; on the other hand, to seize a springboard for crossing the river, directly threatening the safety of Nanjing and Shanghai. After the Nationalist troops successively retreated from Yangzhou, Qin County, and Nantong at the end of last year, the communist forces wanted to seize Yizheng effortlessly. However, the opposite happened. Five or six offensives were launched on Yizheng, but they were unexpectedly driven away by Zuo Zhiren, a young county magistrate who fought hard and refused to surrender. The communist forces were very distressed. Once, they reached the city gate and shouted to the defending soldiers: "Your big city of Yangzhou has been lost. Are you fools still trying to defend this broken pig city?" From that time on, around the beginning of February, Yizheng fell into a fate of being surrounded on three sides with the river on the remaining side. Later, although the communist forces' offensive temporarily stopped, in reality, they knew that this group of local communists could not take Yizheng. So, on the 6th of this month, the 26th Army of the Eighth Corps, led by Zhang Mingchu with three to four thousand men, was suddenly transferred from Lai'an County via Liuhe, equipped with considerable firepower, including fifteen cannons. They spent a night and took the important stronghold of Xupu Bridge in the northwest of the city in one fell swoop. (Note: Xupu Bridge is about five or six li away from Yizheng city, just to the north of the Simangzhou port on the Yangtze River, seven li away. The mountain peaks undulate and the rivers crisscross, making it a stronghold that threatens the river defense.) On the one hand, the vanguard of the communist forces immediately scurried to the stronghold of La Temple in the north of the city. The county security regiment of the defending army fought bravely under the disparity of strength and retreated to defend the north gate of the city.

Zuo Zhiren's Breakthrough

At 8 PM on the evening of the 7th, the communist forces' offensive intensified. The cannons at Xupu Bridge intensively fired more than 200 shells into Yizheng city and the Jiangmian River area of Siyuan River. At about 11 PM, the county government office was hit by a shell and caught fire. The city was filled with thick smoke, and more than 1,000 communist troops attacked the west gate. By the time the defending troops outside the north gate rushed into the city to reinforce, it was too late to stop them. They then engaged in fierce street fighting with the communist forces, with the sound of fighting shaking the sky. County Magistrate Zuo Zhiren immediately led the security team to break through the fire line and retreated to defend the south gate (the gate is four li away from the Jiangmian River area of Siyuan River). Unexpectedly, a part of the communist forces attacked from the west gate and then divided their troops to occupy the defense positions of the defending troops in the Simangzhou area in the southeast of the city, and thus controlled the gunboats on the Jiangmian River area of Siyuan River. County Magistrate Zuo knew that things were not good and immediately broke out of the south gate and tried to travel along the Siyuan River highway. When he reached a place two li away from the Yisi Bridge midway, the bridgehead asked for the password. County Magistrate Zuo still thought that the bridge was guarded by the security team. The person who asked for the password then said: "Wrong." County Magistrate Zuo was captured here. It is said that he has now been escorted to the Yangzhou Military Control Commission by the communist forces.

Nationalist Troops in Liuwei

After the communist forces captured Yizheng, they became arrogant and launched a fierce offensive on the areas of Sanmao River, Sanjiangying, Shijia Bridge, Liuwei, and Shierwei facing Zhenjiang at dawn on the next day. The communist forces fired more than 3,000 shells in this area. Sanmao River, Sanjiangying, and Shijia Bridge were successively captured, but although the Zhang Mingchu's troops who attacked Yizheng launched a fierce attack on Shierwei, they were suppressed and retreated after continuous shelling by our navy, and dared not act rashly again.

The bridgehead position of the defending troops in Liuwei is extremely strong. From the 8th to the 10th, the communist forces formed an arc-shaped battle line from the east, west, and north sides to encircle Liuwei. The vanguard once reached the vicinity of Chenjia Bridge, four li away from Liuwei. On the morning of the 10th, the people of Zhenjiang were all worried about the gain or loss of Liuwei because Liuwei is just opposite Zhenjiang. If it were abandoned, it would have a great impact on Zhenjiang. Fortunately, the defending troops and the navy used intensive artillery fire to bombard the communist forces, and the communist forces began to retreat. Now the situation in Liuwei is very stable, and a large number of Nationalist troops have been reinforced. The Guazhou area is also quite peaceful. The communist forces stranded on the Yun Causeway of Balipu north of Guazhou are really not easy to sneak across.

The Daqiao town and Xinzhou, located on the east bank of Jiangbei at the junction of Zhenjiang and Yangzhou, are the first district under the jurisdiction of Zhenjiang County. The situation is quite dangerous and is a good springboard for the communist forces to sneak across. Unexpectedly, a part of the communist forces in Sanjiangying coordinated with the local communists to launch a large-scale attack on the night of the 7th. After the local teams calmly responded, the communist forces reinforced with four regiments of troops or more to launch a fierce attack on the night of the 10th. Due to the disparity in strength, the local teams took the initiative to retreat to Dagang. At dawn on the 13th, the Dagang defending troops counterattacked after reinforcements and recovered Gaoqiao Xinzhou in one fell swoop, and captured more than 1,000 communist troops. The communist forces on all fronts had to retreat to the north.

The Delusion of Crossing the River

In summary, the battle for the bridgehead in northern Jiangsu can be said to be a fierce and valuable battle. According to unofficial statistics: the communist forces suffered more than 20,000 casualties this time, with considerable losses. It gave the communist forces' delusion of crossing the river a serious lesson. It is said that a certain political commissar of the CCP in northern Jiangsu made a judgment on the Nationalist troops after the end of the Huaihai Campaign: (1) retreating to defend northern Jiangsu and consolidating the river with the entire division is the best strategy; (2) adding more heavy troops and mobilizing the air force to completely sweep the Binjiang area is the middle strategy; (3) guarding the current strongholds, not advancing or retreating, and waiting for the main force of the communist forces to come south to offset the strength, and exchanging space for time is the worst strategy. However, this time, the Nationalist troops' battle to defend the Jiangbei bridgehead exceptionally strove for the first.

According to the military authorities here, this offensive by the communist forces in northern Jiangsu was a planned action. Although Yizheng, Siyuangou, Sanmaohe, Shijiaqiao and other places were captured, the Nationalist army has close coordination and prevention by the army, navy and air force, so it is still impossible for the communist army to cross the river. We must always be vigilant, defend the natural barrier of the Yangtze River, and ensure the fortress of peace.

### ·Reward of 50,000 Silver Dollars· For the Capture of Jia Yibin

[Our Correspondent, Xing, 15th] After a part of the officers and soldiers of the Hebei Pre-Cadre Regiment mutinied, they were jointly suppressed by the security team of the First District and the Jiangsu Security Team. Most of them have voluntarily surrendered their weapons and sent back to their original posts. There are still more than 80 remnants led by Jia Yibin who fled back to the upper reaches. Chairman Zhou of Zhejiang Province has offered a reward of 50,000 silver dollars for the capture of Jia Yibin. The commissioner has ordered assistance in the arrest to bring him to justice in accordance with the law.

### Lanzhou Industry Faces Crisis: Issuing Loans · Freezing Silver Dollar Storage

— Our Correspondent, Song Lin

[Our Correspondent, Lanzhou, 10th] Lanzhou's industry is facing a crisis. Dozens of small factories that cannot overcome the difficulties have closed down one after another. Financial figures held several symposiums some time ago, brewing the organization of an industrial loan banking group, responsible for industrial loans, and put forward a specific plan to lend 50,000 silver coins to large and small factories to continue production and prosper the economy in the Northwest. In addition, there is also a request to resolve the silver dollars stored in the Central Bank and lend them to the private factories in need of relief first. However, these good prescriptions for resolving the Northwest industrial crisis are still hovering in legal procedures. We only hear the sound of footsteps on the stairs, but we don't see anyone coming down.

When the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee will be established is nowhere in sight, and formal lending is even more unpredictable. Many small manufacturers who were lured by this series of beautiful dreams to "drink poison to quench their thirst" are unwilling to lose money to maintain production, and are planning to close down their factories one after another. Recently, members of various trade unions have been crowding in the small building of the Industrial Association all day long, sighing and sighing, unable to think of any way to persuade the small factory owners who are about to close their doors to endure for a period of time, wait for the ideal fruit to mature, and then reorganize and continue to work.

Among the factories in Lanzhou, except for the provincial leather factory, chemical factory, cement factory, machine factory, electrical appliance factory, and the private Northwest Wool Textile Factory, Lanzhou Woolen Mill, and several large flour mills, the situation is better. The remaining 226 small factories, one-third of them are preparing to close down recently. The most serious are the 82 brick and tile factories, none of which maintain regular production. The 18 soap factories, 30 textile factories, and 9 tannery factories are all overwhelmed. The remaining 9 small flour mills, 39 printing factories, 8 metal processing factories, and 2 match factories are also in a precarious situation.

A person in charge of the Industrial Association told reporters: "If one-third of the 226 factories close down, more than 2,000 workers will be unemployed. Not to mention how the unemployed workers will solve their future lives, just imagine how much impact this group of people crowding on the streets will have on society?"

"Then," the reporter asked him, "what measures will the Industrial Association take to save this crisis?" He responded with a helpless bitter smile.

### Rain in Anxi County

The car bypassed Chijinbao and continued to climb up the Gansu-Xinjiang Highway at the 838-kilometer mark. The rain was getting heavier and heavier, but it was only about 2 PM when we reached the county seat of Yumen. We decided to rush on in the rain and pass through more than 200 kilometers of the Gobi Desert at a very fast speed.

On this section of the road, we unexpectedly enjoyed the rain scene in the Gobi Desert. Except for the Mogongtan area in Anxi County, which is a green grass lake, with large patches of light red, light purple, and pink-white wildflowers blooming on the shallow grass, happily receiving the raindrops, the rest of the area is almost entirely sandy gravel covered with camel thorns. The construction of this section of the road is extremely easy. Just measure the direction, dig two ditches in the Gobi Desert, and pave some gravel between the two ditches, and you can drive smoothly. Therefore, this section of the road is extremely straight. Later, the rain became heavier and heavier, and the low-lying areas of the road surface accumulated into pools of water, but the car was still able to cross the water without hesitation.

The Qilian Mountains to the south of the road and the Mazong Mountains to the north of the road gradually disappeared from our sight, and the impact was vague and unclear. The horizon seen at the end of the eye is dome-shaped, and only the road in front of us extends to the intersection point and almost connects with the sky.

The car passed Qiaowan Town. There is a road here that extends to Gongpoquan, a major town in the Mazong Mountains. Although there is no passenger or freight transport, the Seventh District Road Administration still runs a car once a week for maintenance. There is also a story of a human skin drum here: According to legend, Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty once dreamed at night in the desert, saw nine trees and a bridge, and an old man under the bridge told him the place name of Qiaowan Town, and suggested that Kangxi build a castle here that was similar in size to the Beijing city circle, which would be beneficial to the Qing Dynasty. Kangxi woke up and ordered people to visit this town in various places. Later, it was found that Anxi had this place name, and there were nine trees, just as seen in the dream. He then ordered his nephew, the Governor-General of Shaanxi and Gansu, Cha, to supervise the construction of the castle here, just like the Beijing system. Cha saw that this place was desolate and did not care much, so he casually supervised the construction of a small castle to perfunctorily complete the task, embezzling a lot of public funds. Later, after being reported, Kangxi was furious and issued an edict to strip Cha of his skin and use it to make a drum, and use his skull and other things to make wine vessels and sacrificial utensils to warn against corruption. The highway does not pass through the castle, and it is said that the human skin drum and skull are now stored in the Anxi Folk Education Museum, so the car did not stop. Everyone in the car talked about the punishment of skinning. Although it was too cruel, Kangxi's determination to punish corruption was still talked about by the people. It can be seen that the people, after suffering hundreds of years of brutal political oppression from the Qing Dynasty, would also create this kind of story to vent their feelings.

Going further ahead is Bulongji. It used to be a densely populated and commercially prosperous big city. It is said that there were five or six thousand residents, but now it has become a deserted city. Most of the city has been engulfed by the desert and has become an area where wolves roam.

At about 7 PM, we arrived in Anxi in torrential rain. Anxi is the center of the three counties outside the pass. In addition to the highway to Lanzhou, it can go northwest to Xingxingxia, drive straight to northern Xinjiang, and go west to Dunhuang, out of Yumenguan, to southern Xinjiang, and southwest over Yangguan, to Qinghai, and is an important town in the Western Regions. The "wind" in Anxi is constant throughout the year, especially in winter and spring. Flying sand and rocks are commonplace. Together with the "heat" of Turpan and the "cold" of Zhenxi, they are called the three wonders outside the pass. The famous "ancient Shazhou" is in the southwest of Anxi, and is now gradually being buried by flying sand.

That night, we stayed overnight in the county self-defense team headquarters. The county magistrate told reporters: Anxi has an area of more than 43,000 square kilometers. In the Han and Tang dynasties, there were 80,000 residents, but it gradually decreased later. In 1929, there were still 40,000 people, but now there are only more than 22,000 people left. In the past, counties outside the pass did not conscript Zhuang Ding, but replaced them with horses. Since this year, Zhuang Ding must serve in the military. The result of the conscription is that the population has sharply decreased again, and the young and strong have fled to other places. The old, weak, and women and children have been displaced. The original farmland has been abandoned. What is there to talk about reclamation? What is there to talk about immigration?

The vastness of the land, the inconvenience of transportation, and the distance between each township and county are often 70 or 80 li. (The nearest Yuquan town is 70 li away from the county seat, and the farthest Liugou township is 260 li away from the county seat.) Usually, the transmission of information relies on riding horses or walking, so the implementation of government orders is really slow. The land here is barren and lacks rain. Years of disasters have made people miserable, and the inability to guarantee supplies has made people silent for a long time!

Talking about the lack of light, heat, and water, the people's alienation from cultural education, the 90,000 square kilometers of no man's land, and the troubles that nomadic peoples bring to the people outside the pass...etc., are all common problems among the counties, which will be reported one by one later.

Under the dim kerosene lamp, listening to the rustling rain, until the dawn once again returned to the earth.

### Introducing the Emergency Medical Aid Society (1)

Answering Readers' Inquiries, Enthusiastic People Contributing What They Can

A month and a half ago, a reader wrote to this newspaper asking if there were any charitable organizations in Shanghai that could apply for emergency medical aid. We gave a brief answer in the "Letter Box" based on what we knew. In the past week, among the letters we have received from readers asking about emergency medical aid, there have always been three or five letters a day. Some asked to publish the hospitals and their addresses where emergency medical aid can be applied for in detail to benefit the sick. We feel that this is a social welfare undertaking, and the poor citizens of this city should know that if they unfortunately suffer from an emergency illness, they can get timely treatment, so that they will not lose their lives due to lack of medical treatment; or they will delay the opportunity of treatment due to temporary lack of medical expenses, and finally sacrifice their lives. Therefore, we do not hesitate to use space to give a detailed introduction. At the same time, we hope that the enthusiastic and wealthy people in this city will donate more to jointly participate in this righteous cause. Because this emergency medical aid organization, although it has directors who are solely responsible for the basic economic responsibilities and regularly bear huge burdens, also accepts donations from enthusiastic people outside and citizens who have been helped.

### Drug Trafficking and Extortion, Impersonating Military Officers: Dai Qian's Accomplices Arrested

Four Criminals Escorted to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Police Headquarters

[Our Correspondent, Wuxi, 15th] In recent days, more than a dozen soldiers of unknown identity have been found at the Suzhou, Wuxi, and Wujin stations on the Nanjing-Shanghai line. Some of them were wearing civilian clothes. After Zhang Jiacang, director of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Police First Unit, discovered that their actions were secretive, he secretly paid attention to them and learned that they were all Dai Qian's accomplices. They often took the sixth train on the Nanjing-Shanghai line and arrived in Wuxi from Shanghai at about 11 AM. After staying in the urban area or teahouse, they returned on the 71st Taihu Lake train that night. Director Zhang then launched a reconnaissance operation. When the Taihu Lake train arrived at the Wuxi station early the day before yesterday, he saw a person in civilian clothes in the group of soldiers carrying light bulb cigarettes and other items, and hurriedly left the station with a flustered look, and immediately arrested him. At the same time, three soldiers were also arrested and temporarily detained. According to the person in civilian clothes, his name is Cong Zhenhua, originally from Sixian County, Anhui Province, 56 years old, living at No. 46 Inguo Lane, Suzhou. A bag of poisonous powder, 16 large and small gold rings, and a small gold bar were found on him on the spot. One of the soldiers in military uniform, named Yao Mingshi, 46 years old, from Linjin, Shanxi Province, living at No. 22 Yangyu Lane, Suzhou, was found with a bag of drugs and a forged work permit and business card of Lieutenant Colonel Chief of Staff of Zhang Xijiu's 19th Army. It was published that he graduated from the fourth phase of the military academy and was crowned with the title of Major General. One person, Ma Zhenhai, from Yixian County, Shandong Province, 26 years old, living at No. 124 Northeast Street, Loumen, Suzhou, had a diary containing the words "Dai Wu lost wind" written in it. (Note: Dai Wu is an illegal soldier who specializes in extortion in Shanghai and was wanted and arrested by the Songhu Garrison Command.) One person, Wang Zhennan, 30 years old, from Yinxian County, Zhejiang Province, living at No. 97 Xueji Street, Suzhou, was found with a directory of Shanghai industries and a newsletter of Shanghai firms. In addition to ordering the strict arrest of the remaining accomplices to bring them to justice, the above-mentioned criminals will be presented to the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Police Headquarters for verification.

### 江防戰急劇進行中　訪安慶前綫　（下）
The River Defense Battle Intensifies: A Visit to the Anqing Front Lines (Part Two)

— By Our Correspondent Liu Zao

With the air force's reconnaissance reports providing a clear understanding of the Communist army's movements to the artillery positions of the defending forces, and the air force's strafing and bombing further boosting the morale of the defending troops, the Nationalists are using a three-dimensional warfare approach to overwhelm the Communist "human wave tactics." Under this three-dimensional firepower, the Communist "human wave tactics" are merely increasing their own casualties.

The navy is a successful component of this defense campaign. Its naval gunfire blockade prevents the Communist forces on the east and west flanks of the city from approaching the suburbs, and it also shields the victorious counterattacks of the defending forces. Even the numerous small hills in the northern suburbs of the city, which the Communist army attempted to use to evade naval fire, were subjected to flanking fire, resulting in significant casualties.

Major Zhang Jiabao, commander of the Fifth Naval Defense District, engaged in a lively discussion with the reporter on the "Yongding" warship about the Battle of Anqing, also considering it a successful example of naval-land coordination. As long as the defending forces requested naval gunfire at specific locations, the navy was able to smoothly direct its attack to those points with intense fire. However, in the "Battle of Anqing," the navy also had over a hundred soldiers wounded.

Air and Sea Coordination in Combat

The air force and navy's coordinated combat with the army in this defense of Anqing was the most outstanding engagement. The air force's reconnaissance ensured that the Communist army's actions could not escape the National army's control. As long as

The People of Anqing

The citizens have contributed significantly to the defense campaign over the past ten days. All men aged eighteen to forty-five participated in the National army's battle lines, serving as laborers, stretcher-bearers, medical staff, nurses, and constructing trenches. They did not evade their duties or complain during the intense fighting amid the roar of artillery fire.

The stability and composure of the people's lives within the city is truly surprising. They all have faith that Anqing is as solid as Mount Tai, so they have no fear of war.

Here, a pair of leather shoes costs only two Yuan silver dollars, while three pairs of cloth-soled shoes are priced at one silver dollar. Several days ago, because the defending forces received rewards from the Huazhong Pacification Headquarters, the number of silver dollars in the market suddenly increased, and the market price was lowered by silver speculators. One Yuan silver dollar cost only 13,000 gold yuan notes. Yesterday's market price was 28,000 per dollar. When the "Generals" took silver dollars to the streets to exchange them, they were deliberately undervalued by silver speculators, but they never complained. The citizens expressed unanimous praise for the strict discipline of the defending troops.

With the beautiful cooperation between the military and the civilians, today's Anqing defense battle has demonstrated extreme success.

### 軋空昨愈演愈烈　華股續演滿堂紅
Short Squeeze Intensifies Yesterday; Chinese Stocks Continue to Stage a Complete Rally

[Report from our office] The Chinese stock market yesterday was unprecedentedly prosperous. The rising trend continued unabated. Prices of goods outside the customs were like wild horses running loose. Rumors spread in the market that silver was being hoarded, and people panicked. The short squeeze intensified on the market. The shorts were at their wits' end. All stock exchanges opened at the limit up. Formal trading on the market has been purely symbolic for the past two days. Off-market gray market trading added leverage.

Yongsha reached a high of 16 yuan. In the middle of the day, news of gold dumping caused sentiment to soften slightly, falling to 12 yuan. Towards noon, generally in view of the daily rise, it was feared that there might be a reaction on Monday next week. Selling was more active. Leveraged trading also retreated to 8 yuan. In the afternoon, the firm trend remained. Furthermore, due to the weekend, the previous session all reached the limit up.

The bulls in the aftermarket were unwilling to sell off at the limit, and trading could not be opened. The brokers all had a good time. Three stocks, including China-France Pujiang Electric, etc., did not reach the limit up in the previous session, but stopped at the limit price in the afternoon, while the rest all ended at the previous session's limit price.

### 金債外股續挺
Gold Bonds and Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise

[Report from our office] Yesterday, the money supply for gold public bonds eased, and the price of gold soared. The market sentiment was exuberant. The market was very receptive, but the sellers were reluctant to sell, and the transaction was thin. The highest opening was 2.4 million, and it rose all the way to 2.88 million, reaching the limit. In the aftermarket, there were buy orders at the limit-up price, but no sell orders. The total turnover for the day was 39 taels, an increase of 480,000 yuan.

Foreign stocks yesterday saw a shift in trading as all commodities rose, with holders squeezing the available spot goods and reluctant to sell. Yisha was quoted at 240,000 and 260,000, up 60,000 yuan. Deduon was quoted at 720,000 and 740,000, with very few transactions. Union Wharf, Wing On, and Jardine Brewery had no quotations.

Central Bank Dumps Over 500 Bars; Gold Price Up 500,000 From Yesterday; Over-the-Counter Futures Break the 10 Million Mark

[Report from our office] Yesterday's gold market was still strong, continuing to advance to new heights. There was demand but no supply on the market, as usual with the 6,048,000 limit up untouched. Over-the-counter spot trading was active. As the increase in gold prices was far less than that of general commodities, all parties were enthusiastically absorbing supply. The opening price was 7,200,000 and 7,500,000, gradually rising to 7,300,000 and 7,600,000. The Central Bank entrusted Dadesheng and Zhaofengchang Gold Shop to dump gold without restrictions at 7,300,000, gradually decreasing to 7,200,000, and sentiment softened, returning to a low of 7,100,000 and 7,400,000. At noon, the Central Bank lowered the price again to 7,000,000 and dumped gold in large quantities, totaling more than 500 large bars. The noon closing was a small 7,000,000 and 7,300,000, an increase of 500,000 over the previous day's result. Afternoon trading was sluggish. The overnight interest rate was 240 yuan, and settlement next Monday was quoted as high as 8,700,000 and 8,900,000.

[Report from our office] Yesterday's over-the-counter futures trading was frantically rising due to the deliberate hype by behind-the-scenes big players. The morning opening was 8,000,000 and 8,300,000, reaching a high of 8,100,000 and 8,400,000, and a low of 7,400,000 and 7,700,000. The noon closing was 7,900,000 and 8,100,000.

### 茶市交易式微
Tea Market Transactions Waning

[Report from our office] The reporter met with a powerful person in the tea industry, according to reports: since the loss of credibility of the Gold Yuan, silver dollars that have been hidden for many years have once again become active in the market. It has been found that tea companies have switched to calculating the value of foreign exchange transfer certificates for export box tea, and domestic tea is also gradually quoting prices in silver dollars, except for a portion that is sold in gold. Therefore, when converted into Gold Yuan, it changes rapidly and new peaks emerge endlessly, which is very different from the past. However, buying has contracted, and transactions have become less and less, and there is more empty calling.

Tung Oil Advances

The Tung Oil market yesterday, since the publication of the mid-month index, colleagues are mostly busy raising money for employee salaries, and therefore have no intention of accepting. However, the sellers' quotation is still according to gold value, 3 dimes 3 cents per tan for full weight, 4 dimes per tan for green oil, and 3 dimes 8 cents for each bucket of West Hong from various brands, although there is a lack of competition, when calculated at the gold price of the day, it is still advancing to new peaks. As for the full-weight Tung Oil purchased by the China Trust Bureau, the purchase price continues to maintain the original judgment.

What is the Impact of the Hong Kong Gold Ban?

Since the day before yesterday, the Central Bank has been listing silver dollars for receiving gold, the first day the listed price was one gold for forty-eight silver, the second day was one to fifty, yesterday it was one to fifty-two, with a dual effect of raising the gold price on one side and lowering the silver dollar on the other.

The day before yesterday, I analyzed the matter of raising the gold price in this newspaper and reminded readers to be careful of fire, fearing that there would be illness in the fur. Now, I can add a few more materials, which are also in line with the conclusions of the previous analysis.

(1) Hong Kong has been banning residents from buying and selling gold since the fourth, and people are not allowed to hold it. The Hong Kong authorities will forcibly buy it.

In the past, the Hong Kong gold market was often one of the external causes that stimulated gold prices in Shanghai and other places. This move eliminated this external stimulus.

(2) The Hong Kong authorities will forcibly buy up gold stored by the people, so they will naturally announce an official purchase price. This official price, calculated according to the linked ratio of the Hong Kong dollar to the US exchange and the Hong Kong dollar to the British pound, plus freight, will not exceed 200 Hong Kong dollars per tael much. However, the market price of gold in Hong Kong before the ban was 320 Hong Kong dollars per tael. Therefore, the announcement of the official price will not have no impact on the domestic gold price. Because there may be some Hong Kong gold smuggled into the country.

Although merchants and people in Hong Kong are asking the Hong Kong authorities to consider the interests of merchants and people when deciding on the purchase price. Unfortunately, the problem does not lie in the interests of Hong Kong merchants, but in the exchange rates of the Hong Kong dollar and the British pound, which are both legal exchange rates in the International Monetary Fund. If the Hong Kong gold price is changed, it is tantamount to devaluing the Hong Kong dollar and the British pound, and then there will be disputes like the high-priced gold in South Africa in the past. Is the British side intending to fight the United States again? It seems unpredictable.

(3) The above are external factors. There is also a new internal factor, that is, the so-called "Financial Reform Amendment," which has been passed by the Legislative Yuan, and it will inevitably be a show of strength to save face.

Today, I will talk about the so-called suppression of the silver dollar. The so-called suppression of the silver dollar is nothing more than the "Overthrow Yuan Movement," making the small head sailing ship and Yuan silver dollar look the same. I have said repeatedly that now I want to talk about whether the Central Bank has a draft to raise the gold and silver ratio to what extent? I am not a roundworm in my stomach, so of course I cannot talk nonsense. However, I will list the historical changes in the gold and silver ratio below for your reference:

### 分析今日青鐵大戰
Analyzing Today's Qing-Railroad Showdown

[Report from our office] This season's football competition, the Mayor's Cup already belongs to the Railroad team, the Youth Cup was won by the Pan team, the Group B League Championship has become the Pan team's bag, and the Group C Championship is Yingguang. Whether the Group A League Championship can still be won by the Qingbai Association, or be monopolized by the Mayor's Cup champion Railroad team with a double championship, depends on today's most important battle. There are two games today, and the order is as follows:

10:00 AM: Zhichao vs. Qunli (Group A League) Yiyuan

3:00 PM: Qingbai vs. Railroad (Group A League) Yiyuan

In the morning game, the two teams drew in the previous match. In terms of recent form, the Zhichao youngsters have been in good form, and Qunli has also dominated in the South City. Their strengths are comparable, and a fierce battle is inevitable to fight for a better position.

The Qingbai vs. Railroad match is related to the championship battle. Qingbai still maintains an undefeated honor in the league, having only drawn with Jingwu. Railroad has only lost to Qingbai once. The two teams have played a total of ten games, and Qingbai is only two points ahead of Railroad. In today's game, Qingbai only needs to win or draw to overcome the difficulties and win the championship. If Railroad can beat Qingbai, the two teams will have the same score and will have to be decided again. This battle is not only a shortcut for Qingbai to win the championship, but also the last hope for Railroad to win the championship. Both sides have held general practice this week, strategizing and waiting for the time to strike, and will inevitably go all out. The recent situation of the two teams is as follows:

Team Name (Played) (Won) (Lost) (Drew) Total Score

Qingbai 10 9 0 1 19

Railroad 10 8 1 1 17

Qingbai's advantage lies in defense. Meng, Jiang, Xue, Zhang, Han, Fu and other flying generals guard the key points, preventing enemy cavalry from crossing Yinsan Mountain. To break through Qingbai's solid fortress, it is necessary to rely on high speed on both wings, which will inevitably be twice the effort for half the result. Failure to attack will lead to tired soldiers and weakened morale in the second half. Solid defense will be unstable. It is necessary to pay attention to this. It is said that "Qingbai has feet" and "Railroad has a head," which means that Luo Shoufu is good at shooting and Lu Sheng is good at cutting in and knocking on the barrier. Xiao Luo is the blood vessel of Qingbai. If Xiao Luo can move, then Lu Sheng and center Du Hu are both formidable. If Xiao Luo is restrained, Qingbai's offensive will inevitably be frustrated. The gain or loss depends entirely on this. When playing, it depends on the state of Xiao Luo and the state of the Railroad forward who is guarding Xiao Luo. I believe that Cao Liming is not Xiao Luo's opponent. Today, Wu Jiabang and Gao Baozheng will inevitably increase their burden.

Railroad is a team performance, with tacit coordination. The forward has Lu Qingxiang's head attack and Zhang Jie's rushing momentum, and Xiao Ziwen's opening road. I believe that Xiao should be transferred to the left wing to increase the speed of both wings, which will be enough to give Qingbai several threats. Binghao has a way and experience, but unfortunately his speed is not as good as Xiao Xiao. This is what is called advancing but not being able to be, rushing to the void. Xiao Xiao can rush to the void and create opportunities for Zhang Jie and Xiao Lizi, so there is a need to consider reorganizing the front line. Qingbai may not dare to be sure of winning and underestimate the enemy, so the Railroad generals should deal with it carefully, abandon the heart of gain and loss, and there is also hope for success. The lineup is as follows:

Qingbai

Huang Shijie

Han Changrong Zhang Renyi Jiang Wenqing

Fu Naitang Meng Yiliang Xue Peiran

Jin Lusheng Luo Taofu Liu Long Gu Ersa Liu Tiyin

Railroad

Liao Xiong

Yue Renxiao Wu Jiabang

Lu Bingsheng Gao Baozheng Cao Liming

Wu Binghao Xiao Ziwen Qu Xigen Zhang Jie Lu Qingxiang Lin Xingyi

Due to time constraints, the game ended here. In the third game, Hualian defeated the Friend team. The difference in strength made it impossible to play hard. The result was 66 to 50, with 37 to 18 in the first half. About 2,000 spectators were most interested in the fierce friendly match.

### Rules for Women's Matches Against Men: A New Page in Sports History

The "Ice Team" versus the "Youth Team" marked Shanghai's first official women's basketball game using men's rules, kicking off the Mayor's Cup basketball tournament. The players appeared more excited on the surface, but whether their general physical condition could "handle it comfortably" was another question.

Six minutes into the game, Sun Jingzhi of the Ice Team scored first. Zhu Zhen followed with a free throw, ending the first quarter with a score of 3-0. In the second quarter, Jingzhi scored again. The Youth Team struggled, and Fu Baozhen seized an opportunity to score two points, strengthening their fighting spirit. Sun Jingren of the Ice Team quickly retaliated. As the first half (sixteen minutes) ended, the Ice Team led 7-2.

The Ice Team continued to dominate in the third quarter. It was said that the team had "teacher-student cooperation," resulting in a score of 15-4 in this quarter. Although the Youth Team players were small, they displayed lively energy in the final quarter, earning more sympathy and encouragement than their older opponents. The final score was 23-10, and the Youth Team was eliminated.

### Exhibition Match Surpasses Regular Game: Green Forest and Mai Ling Tie

Mai Ling versus Police Machinery. The latter had not completed their away games in Wuxi and reluctantly withdrew. The Green Forest team stepped in for an exhibition match. The initial five players for Green Forest were Le Jiazhou, Ye Yunshan, Chen Zhengmiao, Lin Shaohua, and Wang Cunzhong. Although Zhengmiao opened the scoring, the Mai Ling team, led by Hua Jikai and Xiong, quickly took a 6-2 lead. Green Forest fought hard. When Jiazhou made two free throws, the score was tied at eight. Le continued to score, pulling ahead 12-10. Mai Ling, with Ounas, Laislem, and Shan, pressed hard, making it 16-14, changing the situation again. Both sides had skilled shooters, leading to a back-and-forth battle. After a 20-20 tie, Green Forest gradually fell behind. At 25-20, Chen Guozhen replaced Wang Cunzhong. At halftime, Mai Ling was at 26, and Green Forest was at 24.

In the second half, through the efforts of Tianmiao and Jiazhou, the score was tied at 29. Mai Ling pulled ahead again. At the closest point, the difference was only one point. Green Forest scored many points with long shots. After Ye Yunshan committed his fifth foul, Green Forest made several adjustments. Finally, Le scored a goal, resulting in a 51-51 tie. No winner was determined.

In overtime (five minutes), Kaixiong scored two goals under the basket, and Jiazhou scored twice with back-to-the-basket shots, resulting in another 55-55 tie. In the second overtime, Zhengmiao scored one free throw first, and Mai Ling missed three free throws. Hua Jikai tied the score at 56, making it impossible to break the tie. By this time, it was already 8 o'clock, and since there was another game, they decided not to determine the winner.

### Disappointing Final Match: Uneven Strength Leads to Lack of Excitement

Hua Lian versus Friendship Team was the third game last night. The Friendship Team was a combined force from the Pingping and Pushui teams. Fu Jinsheng scored a goal within three seconds. Wang Weijun of the Friendship Team surprisingly scored two goals in a row, taking a 4-3 lead. From then on, Hua Lian did not dare to relax. Fu Shan and Zhenzhong, and Songyuan quickly scored seven points, and soon it was 20-8. At halftime, it was 37-18.

In the second half, Xiangcheng replaced Da Li, but both were uninspired. Hua Lian adopted an open-door policy, relying on emotion, allowing the Friendship Team to compete on equal footing. Le Jiazhou of Hua Lian did not play because he had played in the Green Forest game. Li Hanting had already transferred to the Kang Team, so they only had six players last night. As a result, Hua Lian defeated the Friendship Team 66-50.

### Group B Table Tennis League: Seven Matches Today

The Fourth Table Tennis League continues today (17th) with seven Group B matches starting at 9:00 AM at the Cishu Third Floor Jingfen Billiards Room. The Seeded New Star Team and Star Light Team of Division B3 are both making their debut. Their opponents are mediocre, so they are sure to win. The Yucai Team consists of young players with refined skills, so the Jiaolong Team will likely have difficulty winning. In Division B2, the Tianxiang Team is no match for the Chongben Team. In Youlian versus Fansheng, the former has rising stars such as Zhou Muman, Zhang Jiliang, and Liu Guozhang, making them fiercely competitive. Although the latter has veteran players like Cai Senxiong and Wu Rongjiang, it will be difficult to blunt Youlian's edge. Lianqing and Xinghuo are both teams that have suffered defeats. Their skill levels are similar, so there will be a tough battle. In Division B1, Yongwu has veteran player Chen Zhenan, giving them strong momentum, so the Jianxin Team will be overwhelmed. The original Group A1 match tonight between Quanlv and Qinglian has been rescheduled because Quanlv's main player, Zhang Juchen, has not recovered from a back injury. They have obtained the latter's consent to reschedule and have reported it to the organizers for a make-up match. The schedule for today's matches is as follows:

Guansheng - New Star (B2) 9:00 AM Jingfen

Jinmen - Star Light (B3) 10:30 AM Jingfen

Jiaolong - Yucai (B3) 12:00 PM Jingfen

Tianxiang - Chongben (B2) 1:30 PM Jingfen

Youlian - Fansheng (B2) 3:00 PM Jingfen

Lianqing - Xinghuo (B2) 4:30 PM Jingfen

Yongwu - Jianxin (B1) 6:00 PM Jingfen

The Second Ma Team of Group B1 made their debut the night before and fought very bravely. Shuping only relied on Qian Weibian to win a valuable point, breaking the duck egg record. As a result, the Second Ma Team won 4-1. In the same division, the Second Hua Team suffered a painful defeat by Yousi, unable to resist, and lost 0-5. In addition, the Seeded Zhaoshang Team in Division B2 had skilled soldiers and strong generals. Each player easily defeated Lianqing in straight sets, and the five generals did not show any effort. Also, the process of Zhongnong versus Xin Yi was particularly fierce. Zhongnong lost the first group due to Chen Zhikun's loss to Sun Huimin in a tense match, affecting the overall situation. As a result, Xin Yi defeated their strong opponent again 3-2, which can be said to be extremely dangerous. The results of each match are as follows:

Second Ma defeated Shuping (B1) 4-1

Yousi defeated Second Hua (B1) 5-0

Zhaoshang defeated Lianqing (B2) 5-0

Xin Yi defeated Zhongnong (B2) 3-2

After switching sides, Longtou launched a fierce counterattack, with the center forward scoring a goal, making it 3-2. After that, although both sides worked hard, they were unable to score. In the end, the Pan Team won the Youth Cup by a one-goal difference.

### Longtou Three Hearts Red, China Aviation Unexpectedly Crushed: Boring Match, Fans Disinterested

[Our Reporter] Longtou and China Aviation played in the Group A Football League yesterday afternoon at Yiyuan. Although the weather was good, the enthusiasm of the fans was poor, with less than 2,000 people attending. Furthermore, due to the boredom and low quality of the match, countless fans left after the first half. The atmosphere at the stadium was bleak. As a result, Longtou scored one goal in the first half and two more in the second half, hitting the target three times. Although China Aviation returned triumphantly from their away games, they were crushed. Longtou did not play as tightly as usual, and China Aviation was even more disorganized. However, the competition was quite fierce. Longtou captain Xia Shufu, who had not shown his face for a long time, also appeared on the field yesterday and worked especially hard. Northern fans kept cheering.

Referee Jiang Yinseng, the two sides engaged in a fierce battle, evenly matched and difficult to advance. The ball only circulated in the midfield. Until the 36th minute, Xia Shufu approached the opponent's goal and skillfully created a "steal." Chen Qin broke through and scored, taking the lead. China Aviation tried hard to counterattack, but often stopped at the gate and could not penetrate. The first half ended with a score of 1-0. After the break, the two sides reorganized. China Aviation did not change its original lineup, while Longtou Wu Kaimin stepped down, and Wang Burong replaced him. Longtou's morale was high, controlling the offense. Chen Qin received the ball and stuffed it into the middle. Xia Shufu galloped forward and shot it wide. Not long after, Jin Jiabiao committed a foul. Shi Dafa took a free kick, passed it low to the center, and Jiang Kun shot it on the rebound, hitting the crossbar. Chen Qin made a comeback, hooked it in at the baseline, Jiang Kun headed it, and Xu Fusheng just caught it. In the 40th minute, Xia Shufu came up with another "steal." Chen Qin seized the opportunity to enter and pushed it near the goal, scoring another goal, 2-0. In a moment, Longtou became greedy. Zhang Jingen passed it to the front of the goal, Jiang Kun rushed in and shot, hitting the bullseye again, making it 3-0. As the sun set, the silver whistle blew long, and China Aviation lost 3-0.

### Portraits of the Mayor's Cup Beauties

— Hongchen

Spring is beautiful in Jiangnan, and the Mayor's Cup basketball tournament is in full swing again. In recent days, the league's good shows have just ended, and the final competition is about to be staged. The situation on the court is not only tense on the outside but also changing rapidly. The team leaders are busy pulling angles. The famous players are using their performances in the league as their market price. If they don't demand a "next-day advance," they are fools. The facts of the past three years tell us that the winner of this trophy is always a dark horse, leaving the fans with a mysterious impression, and then bidding farewell to the basketball season. Therefore, Hua Lian can hold the league's silver cup for four consecutive seasons, but cannot kiss this Mayor's Cup, which believers consider an odd number. The 3198 Signal Team, the Columbus American Ship, and the defending champion Dagong have successively broken Hua Lian's dream of winning two cups in a season. To review the pre-match situation of the Mayor's Cup men's group, the lessons of history tell us that we can only turn to the gods of fate.

Therefore, I would rather talk about the Mayor's Cup women's group. After it was once rumored that the Mayor's Cup women's group would adopt Canadian rules, suddenly, at a certain basketball committee meeting, with a tense difference of five votes to four votes, it was passed to change to playing men's rules. What accompanied this major change was that as many as nine teams signed up, breaking the history of Shanghai women's basketball. The women are all stirred up, reversing the past shy state.

Someone said: The old champion Green Team has always had very few players. This time, playing men's rules, not only has it not greatly recruited new players, but also whether the two guards Wang Weizhen and Wu Ailian, with their blessed appearance, can run the whole court is a question. In fact, the rules have changed. The trend of this year, based on basketball logic, is that the Green Team is still in a situation of receiving the silver cup first and then playing the game. Huang Mingyuan, Shi Zonglan, and Zhu Jinyun, these three trump cards of the Green Team, are enough to serve as capital to secure the championship. The problem lies in some emerging teams such as the You Team, the Ice Team, and the Eagle Team. Their original movements have only recently been learned from women's rules, and if they change to playing men's rules, I really don't know what a terrible appearance they will play. No wonder several referees are already worried about being unfortunately assigned to enforce the law in the women's group.

The most disadvantaged by changing to men's rules is the Li Team. Under the conditions of small stature and lack of experience, the hard training in recent days cannot achieve quick results. Whoever has the trick to eliminate their anxiety is the way. For example: Yao Silian, the center of the Li Team, has scored a lot of points in the league, but she can never be competent for the center position that takes care of both the front and the back in men's rules. The Green Team has Huang Mingyuan or Zhu Jinyun, the Ya Team has Wang Shan, and anyone from the Li Team to be the center will inevitably be ridiculed for being Liao Hua. Although Qian Chuping is the older sister of the Li Team, she has always been good at attacking the ball and is not suitable for being a center who must assist in defense.

The Ya Team is the original team of Xinghua in the league, plus Zhu Min and Sun Fengzhu. Judging from Xinghua's idleness in this league, I am afraid that the Green Team and the Li Team are more serious in their daily practice than they are when they play. However, this time they are determined to rise up, with team leaders, coaches, managers, and staff all complete. From Xuebai and Hu Ying to the so-called Minli women generals of today, perhaps it is a traditional habit that practicing the ball has always been less important than other teams. From Xiao Ying, Wang Weiling, and Zhang Xiuli to the recent Wang Zelen and Qian Mengyue, it seems that they are all a harvest of genius. However, under the banner of the Ya Team, coupled with the hint of the trend, they have been practicing at the gymnasium several times at 7:00 in the morning. The sharpshooter Qian Mengyue still shoots accurately, Zhu Min has always been accustomed to playing men's rules, and Wang Zelen's progress is traceable to prices.

Therefore, the scene of the Ya Team and the Li Team fighting for the runner-up in the future will definitely not be slightly worse than the battle that ended in a draw in the league! In the Mayor's Cup, where women play men's rules, it will be an opportunity to show experience. According to the playing history of the Ya Team players, there should be a better result than the league.

After the three seeded teams of Green, Ya, and Li, looking at the schedule, the encounter between John and the Eagle Team to fight for the fourth seeded team will have a fierce battle in the first game. The Eagle Team is the Shanghai Jiang from the University Games. At the beginning, they fought inextricably with John in the final. Only two months apart, the situation has changed greatly. The Eagle Team lacks Wang Shan, and John lacks Zhu Min. Obviously, the Eagle Team is more at a disadvantage. However, a loss may turn out to be a blessing. The Eagle Team simply lost the first game and ran into the circle of the unseeded championship. It would be more interesting to compete with the Li Force Team for the unseeded championship in the future.

As for the Minli Team, after Qian Mengyue, Wang Zelen, and Xu Xiuyun left, it has lost the strength it had when it dominated the middle school competition. As for the You Team, it has only recently sprouted new seedlings in front of the Nanyang Road girls' middle schools. At this moment, there is still a considerable distance to compare with the seeded teams.

### On Layoffs

— Ai Yang

"Layoffs and government reduction, tightening of institutions" seems to have become the first new policy that every new official has after taking office. Dismissing redundant staff to save public funds sounds like a great undertaking!

I recently received a letter from my hometown saying that our county has changed three county magistrates and tightened its institutions three times in the past year and a half. Naturally, it has also laid off staff three times. However, someone counted the number of personnel in the current county government and found that it was not only not one less than a year and a half ago, but it actually had nine more employees. So, I began to doubt the "great policy" of layoffs. After repeated inquiries, I learned that layoffs meant getting rid of some old people and replacing them with some new ones. Out the front door and in the back door. Like the Central Bank's slips, they go out early and return late, which is still equal to the original. You can get the name of selling (layoffs) and also reap the benefits. Some people praise layoffs as the greatest good policy today. Is its "goodness" in this?

Since employees are laid off, severance pay must naturally be paid. At least one month, at most three months or more, to show the benevolence of the person in charge of the layoffs. For the laid-off person, it is not a pleasure to not work and get several months' salary now? It is really a win-win situation. Suppose a person who is good at activities is laid off from Party A and immediately transfers to Party B, and laid off from Party B and transfers to Party C, changing jobs every month and being laid off every month. I believe they can definitely make a "layoff fortune." —However, this is just an "ideal." Most of those laid off are often frowning, reluctant to part with their broken rice bowls. Since the laid-off person does not want to be laid off, the government has to pay him salary when he is not working. If you simply don't lay off, you can avoid hiring new people and make the old people feel at ease. Wouldn't it be good! But, this is also just an "ideal." If the old doesn't go, the new cannot be placed. Anyway, the money belongs to the public, so what does it matter if you spend a little more!

In the city where I currently live, there is a national bank with more than 70 employees. Among them, there are nine deputy managers and eleven assistant managers. Their daily work is to clock in and chat. One deputy manager said to someone: We are really "redundant staff," but the country just doesn't lay us off. Otherwise, if I am laid off, I can get dozens of months of severance pay, and I can take this money to speculate! This reminds people that the government's calculations are very clever. For example, if 10 billion yuan is prepared for severance pay, 2,000 employees with low salaries and belonging to ordinary agencies can be laid off. With the same funds, only dozens of senior employees of state-owned enterprises can be laid off. Of course, since it is a layoff, it is best to lay off more, because you can arrange more yourself. Alas, such layoffs!

### Strange Animal Tales

— Cang Yi

The elephant's love for a partner is very dedicated, as long as its lifespan. When they are separated, they often refuse food to show their sadness.

The common female sea urchin lays five million eggs a year—almost as many as the population of Shanghai. There is also a type of female sand dollar that lays 40 million eggs each time.

Darwin, based on long-term and precise investigations, calculated that earthworms in England and Wales excrete more than 32,000 tons of feces each year.

Japan produces a famous luminescent animal called the peach shrimp, which has many light-emitting organs in its body.

White mice rest ten times and are active ten times (one hour each time) in 24 hours, and sleep for four hours. They do this every day without any deviation.

The armored fish produced in the coastal areas of Taiwan and southern Japan often live in the water with their heads down and tails up in a vertical line. If humans turn their bodies upside down with their heads down, they can only maintain it for up to several tens of minutes.

### The Smallest Republic

— Mao Yi

San Marino is the smallest republic in the world, located on Mount Titano, with medieval towers and battlements scattered throughout. Its entire area is surrounded by Italian territory. Its entire area is only 38 square miles, and its population is only about 15,000 people. However, this small country has a history of 1,600 years.

According to legend, this place was discovered by the Christian stonemason Marino. He lived here in seclusion in the fourth century. This mountain area was donated to him by a Christian landlord, and after his death, it was passed on to his followers, with the instruction that "no outsiders should interfere."

Although San Marino has tried its best to avoid disputes with the world, its strategic location is too important, as it is a natural vantage point for the northern Italian transportation line. Therefore, it is often involved in wars. As early as during Napoleon's conquest of Italy, this small country suffered the devastation of war.

As recently as 1943, during World War II, after Italy surrendered, Nazi armored vehicles drove into San Marino. Almost a year later, British troops advanced here and liberated it. This small country also resolutely rose up and declared war on Germany.

In terms of geography, the people of San Marino live a life of running up and down. As soon as you go out, you are either going down the mountain or up the mountain. Clusters of white farmhouses and churches with pointed roofs in medieval mountain towns appear on the slopes, extending to the rocky mountain peaks.

The capital, San Marino City, is located higher on the hillside. Here there are thick gates, narrow streets, and pointed stone buildings. The stone used for construction is the main wealth of the people of San Marino, and it has a long history. In addition to building stone, the export goods also include wine and cattle. San Marino's finances do not rely on banknotes, but on stamps. Because its stamps are varied and have exquisite patterns, they have long been loved by stamp collectors around the world. Each time new stamps are issued, they can always earn a lot of foreign exchange.

San Marino's national affairs are managed by a parliament composed of 60 deputies, all of whom are elected by the citizens. The parliament then appoints two people as administrative officers for a term of six months, which is the shortest term among the world's heads of state.

### Rules for Eating

— Wang Deyun

In recent days, the price of rice has soared, breaking through the 500,000 mark, scaring ordinary folks. This suddenly made me think that we have always been casual when it comes to eating, but from now on, we really can't be careless. We must set rules for eating to avoid mistakes. Otherwise, "waste" may be unavoidable.

I hereby propose the following four rules for eating:

First Rule: Before eating, you must move your belt slightly upwards and then tighten it.

Explanation: This will inevitably put pressure on the stomach, greatly reducing the amount of food you can eat. It can save food and prevent you from feeling hungry, killing two birds with one stone and having only advantages and no disadvantages.

Second Rule: You must hang upside down when eating.

Explanation: Eating upside down is the best way to avoid wolfing down your food. We usually eat sitting down, and the rice grains slide straight down our throats. Unknowingly, one "slide" can be several bowls, a huge "loss" that goes against the "thrifty" way.

Third Rule: You must not move your teeth when eating; you must swallow the whole grain.

Explanation: This can achieve the great effect of enduring hunger.

Fourth Rule: You must not eat one bite at a time; you must count and swallow the grains one by one.

Explanation: Eating slowly and deliberately like this, a meal can last from six in the morning to eight at night, and you can skip lunch and dinner altogether. Isn't that wonderful?

### Poems of My Good Cottage

— Zhu Airen

"Poems of My Good Cottage," written by Jiang Hongkui Weiqing of Changshu, consists of seventy-one ancient and modern style poems. What he writes is not much, but it is well-crafted. The five-character ancient poems, such as "Feeling About Saying Goodbye at Home While Serving as Secretary in Yaocheng in the Year of Wuxu," express: "Scholars in the world, what do the creators forbid? Hunger and cold press together, looking up and down, there is no place to stand. Frustrated, I construct strange thoughts, conjuring up plans to rely on others. My wife and children know my heart and suddenly add a suggestion in whispers: When young, you did not become famous; when old, you only seek profit in vain. Human life is not a hundred years; why lightly abandon flesh and blood! I lowered my head, dejected and heartbroken, secretly swallowing tears behind my back. The naughty maid hides in the shadow of the wall, sighing and sobbing too!" The feelings are true and the words are real, a master of plain description, making people sigh helplessly when reading them. The seven-character律詩, such as "A Winter Night in Rongcheng, Drinking with Wang Bingqing of Kuaiji, Yu Yicheng of Fuzhou, Xie Bingchen of Xiangxiang, and Wu Yanqing of Jinlv Among Flowers," say: "Deliberately abandoning hometown dreams, wine is repeatedly presented; tonight, in Rongcheng, we spend a small spring. Red friends gradually return to their true colors; yellow flowers faintly reveal their slender spirits. Who is composing 'Qingping Tune' before the wine? We are cold and lonely people meeting on the river. The moon shadow is plump and enclosed, night rain is coming, yet it teaches drunken sleeves to wash off fragrant dust." With each cup and each poem, deep feelings are expressed. The couplet about the true colors of red friends and the slender spirits of yellow flowers is just right. My heart loves it. Another example is "Living in Seclusion in Yan Garden": "Surrounding the painted eaves are mountain lights on all sides; indeed, Yuan Jiu lived in Pengying. Not leaving tax burdens to children and grandchildren, I especially love the clear water and rocks of the garden. At the edge of the sky, the pavilions and towers have cold shadows; in the clouds, chickens and dogs are silent. Peach Blossom Spring has long been separated from the human world; woodcutters, do not spread the Han Dynasty name!" The water is clear and the sand is clean, untainted by a single speck of dust. It is difficult to accomplish this without exceptional talent. Other excellent lines include "Climbing Shengmu Tower on Mochou Lake in Jinling": "The mountain colors and lake light remain from the Six Dynasties; the heroes and heroines each have a thousand autumns." Feeling in the Camp: "The arrogance has not been removed; few know me. Childhood has passed; reading is difficult." On an autumn day, I got drunk with Lou Donglu Xiaolian Xinlan at the foot of the northern mountain, playfully composing poems about the mixed display of wild vegetables and mountain delicacies: "The fragrance suppresses three dou of millet from the small trough; tenderly picking a few stalks of vegetables from the old garden." Visiting Shan Fuqing of Shenjiang at his hidden residence in Yuxi Dianqiao: "Gulls skim the sand marks, passing through reeds; geese drag mountain colors, flying near the lake." At Poshansi Temple: "Empty pond with messy yellow leaves, winding path with deep white clouds." When Zhuo Jianqiu, the second governor of Guangdong, left Zhaowen to take up his post in Yuanhe, I wrote a poem to send him off: "A kindred spirit is thousands of miles away; tonight, we share a cup together." Traveling in Kunshan on Qingming Festival: "The Zen heart is half drunk with the fragrant breeze; the mountain colors are completely evened by the overnight rain." All are clear, beautiful, and worth reciting.

### The Evolution of Silver Dollars

— Binzhi

Due to the malignant inflation of the Gold Yuan Certificate, the value of Yuan Datou (Yuan Shikai silver dollar) has increased daily, reaching unprecedented heights. If Yuan Shikai knew in the afterlife, he would smile with satisfaction in his grave.

Silver dollars are imported goods. The first batch to come to China were Spanish coins, as early as the late Ming Dynasty. At that time, the quantity was small, and circulation was not widespread. By the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods of the Qing Dynasty, trade with overseas countries became increasingly prosperous, and silver dollars flowed into China in large quantities. At first, they only circulated in Guangdong and Fujian provinces, but by the Daoguang period, they were also circulating in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhili, and other provinces. Later, they were also found in inland provinces, with names such as horse coins, lace coins, and cross coins.

Following the Spanish silver dollar, the Mexican silver dollar also flowed into China during the Xianfeng period, which is the so-called "Eagle Dollar." In the thirty years that followed, Eagle Dollars flowed in large quantities, surpassing the Spanish silver dollar in influence. The British occupied Hong Kong and also minted silver dollars for use in Hong Kong and mainland China. Because the fineness was relatively low, they were not very popular. Later, they changed to minting a new coin in India, which was better than the ones minted in Hong Kong, and it became more widely circulated in China. Japanese silver dollars were also imported into China during the Guangxu period. After adopting the gold standard in 1897, Japan exported its discarded silver dollars to China. In addition, Annamese silver dollars and American silver dollars also appeared in the Chinese market.

China's own minting of silver dollars began in the sixteenth year of Guangxu. At that time, because foreign silver coins were rampant, Zhang Zhidong requested permission to open a mint in Guangdong. Before Zhang Zhidong, Lin Zexu had also requested permission, but it was rejected by the ministry. At that time, private individuals also minted silver dollars. During the Daoguang period, Zhejiang Province minted one-tael silver dollars, and Zhu Yuyuan in Shanghai also minted one-tael silver coins during the Xianfeng period. Because the price was inconsistent with the circulating silver dollars, circulation was not widespread. Many silver furnaces and silver shops also imitated silver coins, with names such as "Guang Board," "Jian Board," "Zhe Board," and "Su Board," but these silver coins were not well-received due to their poor weight and fineness.

The silver dollars minted in the sixteenth year of Guangxu weighed seven mace and three fen, with a coiled dragon pattern and the characters "Guangxu Yuan Bao" in both Manchu and Chinese, as well as "Made in Guangdong Province." After the Dragon Dollar was produced, its performance was excellent, so Hubei, Jiangsu, Fujian, Zhili, and other provinces imitated it and circulated it. Later, because the weight and fineness of the silver dollars minted in each province were inconsistent, circulation was greatly affected. In the twenty-seventh year of Guangxu, it was stipulated that each coin should weigh seven mace and two fen and that Hubei and Guangdong provinces should mint them to ensure uniformity. In the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu, the Ministry of Revenue Mint was established in Tianjin to standardize the form of silver coins, which is the "Beiyang Province Made" type of silver dollar we have today.

After the founding of the Republic of China, silver coin regulations were promulgated in the third year, stipulating that each coin should weigh seven mace and two fen and contain .8923 pure silver, which is the Yuan Datou. After the Nanjing and Hangzhou mints were established, they were minted in even greater quantities. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, due to supply falling short of demand in the market, the fineness was reduced to .8895. The current value of Yuan Datou varies in some places depending on the year of minting, and there is a reason for this.

Although Yuan Datou was produced in large quantities, each province still minted its own silver coins under the separatist rule of the warlords. There were many different types, such as the Three Eastern Provinces coin, Sichuan Ocean, Yunnan coin, Jilin coin, and Feng Ocean, with inconsistent forms. Moreover, the fineness was greatly reduced in order to seek profit. The current value of Sichuan Ocean is lower than that of other silver coins, and this is the reason.

After the establishment of the National Government, Sun Yat-sen coins were re-minted. The fineness and weight of Sun Xiaotou were originally the same as Yuan Datou, but now there is a difference in value. I wonder if it is because of the size of the head. Later, the design of the silver coins was changed to sailboats. However, the legal tender system was implemented soon after, and silver dollars were hidden away. It was not until more than ten years later that they reappeared. A scholar who has been away for three days must be looked at with new eyes. After being separated for more than ten years, the value of the silver dollar is now ten thousand times what it once was.
