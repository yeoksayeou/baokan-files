### North and South Strive for Peace; Zhong Tianxin Claims Good Results from Hong Kong Trip; Wu Yuhou and Others Visited Yu Hanmou and Xue Yue Yesterday, Scheduled to Go to Hong Kong

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 18th] Government peace negotiation representative Mr. Zhong Tianxin returned to Guangzhou from Hong Kong on the 17th. It is said that during his trip to Hong Kong, he discussed peace issues with responsible persons of the CCP's South China authorities, and the results were good. However, he declined to disclose the content of the talks. He also stated that although this trip to Hong Kong was not dispatched by President Sun, he had obtained his consent beforehand, which proves that Mr. Sun is definitely not a proponent of war. His current failure to go to Nanjing is purely due to health issues. Mr. Zhong finally stated that he himself will soon fly to Nanjing to meet Acting President Li, report everything, and request instructions on the steps for peace talks. In another development, it is learned that Mr. Zhong's trip to Hong Kong was related to a secret letter from President Chiang to President Sun.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] Wu Yuhou and Wu Zhesheng, etc., of the People's Peace Delegation, visited Yu Hanmou at 10:00 AM and Xue Yue at 4:00 PM on the 18th to report on their meeting with the CCP's Ye Jianying in Beiping and offered suggestions for peace. Afterwards, according to Wu Yuhou, Yu and Xue have no personal prejudices against peace, but generally abide by the will of the government. Wu and others are scheduled to visit CCP personnel in Hong Kong on the 20th.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] Wu Yuhou recently issued a written statement regarding a report that the Nanjing Municipal Council criticized their words and deeds: "It is regrettable that the Nanjing Municipal Council has misunderstood the organization of this delegation. This delegation is jointly formed by major Chinese professors, the National Policy Research Association, and the China People's Peace Promotion Association. It was not formed by the Nanjing Municipal Council. This trip to Beiping is not to negotiate peace with the CCP on behalf of the citizens of Nanjing. In addition to the Executive Yuan allocating a special plane to send us to Beiping, we have never received a penny for travel expenses from any party. As for the statements we have made, we are determined to maintain a fair and just position and have absolutely not engaged in anything that would incite discord between the KMT and the CCP. All of this can be verified. Now there are those outside who do not understand the truth, such as the Nanjing Municipal Council, and their criticisms of this delegation are clearly due to intentional or unintentional misunderstandings. This is a solemn statement."

[United Press, Hong Kong, 18th] According to sources in Guangzhou on the 18th, Professor Wu Yuhou, a member of the Nanjing People's Peace Delegation, has revealed that the delegation proposed seven peace proposals to the CCP, which were approved by CCP Beiping Mayor Ye Jianying to be forwarded to the CCP Central Executive Committee for discussion. The seven suggestions are: (1) Immediate ceasefire; (2) Both sides' troops withdraw 40 li from their current positions; (3) Both sides release political prisoners; (4) Both sides guarantee freedom of speech; (5) The National Army and the Communist Army should be unified and reorganized into the National Defense Force. All military strength should be reduced by 40%, and those who are reduced should be assisted to engage in agriculture, industry, and commerce; (6) A joint government including leaders of all parties should be organized, adopting a 6-6-6 system, with the KMT and the CCP each occupying six positions, and representatives of other parties occupying six positions; (7) The location for the convening of the Political Consultative Conference shall be determined entirely by the CCP. Mr. Wu also said that Ye Jianying had stated that the CCP is willing to achieve "comprehensive peace" and that he believes the CCP has sincerity for peace. Mr. Wu has reported the experience of going to Beiping to Executive Yuan President Sun Ke, but he declined to reveal Sun Ke's reaction. Mr. Wu and other members of the delegation who came to Guangzhou, Wu Zhesheng and Wang Xinghun, may leave Guangzhou for Nanjing on the 19th.

[United Press, This City News] According to Guangzhou news: a KMT authoritative source told the United Press on the 17th that it is generally expected that Sun Ke will resign within ten days. This source had held meetings with government leaders in the past few days and did not seem to believe reports of President Chiang's possible return to power.

Wu Yuhou, the head of the Nanjing Professor Peace Delegation who just came from Beiping, told the crowd that Sun Ke is scheduled to go to Nanjing within days to meet with Acting President Li in order to advance the path to peace. Wu also confirmed that Executive Yuan Vice President Wu Tiecheng will soon come to Nanjing. Developments in Guangzhou have hinted that Professor Wu Yuhou's attempt to persuade government officials of the CCP's peace efforts and sincerity has apparently been successfully. The Professor Peace Delegation has completed its meetings with Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, and other professors. It is generally expected that they will come to Nanjing on the weekend.

[United Press, Beiping, 18th] It was learned today that Yan Huiqing and others of the Shanghai Peace Delegation met with several friends at the Six Nations Hotel yesterday, but did not mention any official business. It has not been decided when the delegation will leave Beiping.

### Legislative Yuan Resumption of Sessions Nears; Location Dispute Remains Unresolved; Tong Guanxian Arrives in Nanjing to Visit Acting President Li

[Our Newspaper News] Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian flew from Shanghai to Nanjing at 1:00 PM on the 18th to handle preparations for the Legislative Yuan's resumption of sessions. Also, reporters interviewed several legislators in Shanghai yesterday to inquire about their views on the date of this resumption of sessions and the topics to be discussed. They generally had no objections to the scheduled resumption date (i.e., the 26th of this month), but expressed serious doubts as to whether a quorum could be reached at that time. As for the topics to be discussed after the resumption of sessions, it is generally believed that political proposals will outnumber legal proposals, and some advocate that the content of peace talks with the Communist Party should be the primary case.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian returned to Nanjing by plane from Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 18th. Legislative Yuan Secretary-General Chen Kewen and others went to the airport to meet him. According to Mr. Tong, he exchanged views with legislators in Shanghai on the location and date of the Legislative Yuan's resumption of sessions. However, as of now, the location of the resumption of sessions has not been decided, and legislators in various places still have inconsistent opinions on the location of the resumption of sessions, which remains to be further coordinated. When reporters asked whether the legislators in Nanjing and Shanghai have already advocated resuming sessions in Nanjing, and the number of people has exceeded the legal quorum for the meeting, whether the sessions can be resumed in Nanjing immediately, Mr. Tong said: No matter where the sessions are resumed, the Legislative Yuan will try its best to show the "completeness" of the Legislative Yuan, and hopes to coordinate the opinions of legislators in various places before deciding on the location of the resumption of sessions. Mr. Tong said that as the President of the Yuan, he personally has no opinion on the location of the resumption of sessions. During his speech, he repeatedly mentioned "completeness," earnestly aiming to avoid divisions, demonstrating his caution in addressing the issue of the location of the Legislative Yuan's resumption of sessions and his efforts to maintain unity. Currently, Mr. Tong and Secretary-General Chen Kewen are working hard to coordinate the opinions of all parties on the issue of the Legislative Yuan's resumption of sessions.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Tong Guanxian paid a visit to Acting President Li on the evening of the 18th to discuss the location and date of the Legislative Yuan's resumption of sessions.

Legislators Remaining in Nanjing Visit President Tong

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Legislators remaining in Nanjing held another discussion meeting on the afternoon of the 18th to exchange views on the issue of the resumption of sessions, and still insisted on resuming sessions in Nanjing. However, due to the urgency of time, the meeting notice should be issued as soon as possible. Lu Yuwen, Li Feng, and Wang Hongshao were appointed to consult with Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian and ask him to make a final decision. At around 6:00 PM, Lu and others visited Mr. Tong and truthfully stated that this matter should be decided after visiting Acting President Li for instructions.

Legislators Remaining in Guangzhou Send Telegrams Urging Him to Come

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 18th] The Liaison Association of Legislators Remaining in Guangzhou sent telegrams to legislators in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places on the 18th, urging them to come to Guangzhou to discuss everything. The telegram reads as follows: "To the Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Chongqing, Chengdu, Guilin, Kunming, Changsha, Taipei, Fuzhou, and Nanchang Municipal Governments, transfer to the Liaison Association of Legislators: Our colleagues remaining in Guangzhou unanimously abide by the joint resolution of the symposium held in Nanjing on January 25 to resume sessions in Guangzhou. The deadline has now arrived. We hope that you will fly to Guangzhou as soon as possible to discuss everything. The Secretariat has properly arranged food and lodging, so please rest assured. We have requested the Executive Yuan to telegraph the provincial and municipal governments and transportation authorities to handle transportation to Guangzhou. Liaison Association of Legislators Remaining in Guangzhou, Chou (February), Qiao (18th)."

Appoint Representatives to Exchange Views

[Another Telegram] The Liaison Association of Legislators Remaining in Guangzhou issued a statement to the Central News Agency reporter on the 18th regarding the location of the resumption of sessions, saying: The government moved to Guangzhou. On January 25, the Legislative Yuan held a symposium in Nanjing and unanimously decided to resume sessions in Guangzhou. The Shanghai colleagues also agreed to this at a symposium. The Secretariat has already arrived in Guangzhou to work and is actively preparing for the resumption of sessions. Therefore, the third session of the Legislative Yuan should be resumed in Guangzhou. Later, because some colleagues advocated resuming sessions in Nanjing, the colleagues in Guangzhou believed that changing the meeting address would not be consistent with the opinions decided at the previous symposium, so they advocated first soliciting opinions from colleagues in various places, preferably by voting to determine the majority. After repeated discussions among the colleagues in Guangzhou, it was decided to appoint representatives to go to Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Guilin, Chengdu, Chongqing, and Taiwan to exchange views, and strive to concentrate the will of the Legislative Yuan colleagues in order to cope with difficulties.

### Vice President Wu Changes Flight to Nanjing to Today

### Chen Lifu Hints to Reporters That the Overall Situation May Become Clear Within a Week

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 18th] Political Committee Member Chen Lifu recently told reporters that his trip to Guangzhou was purely to take care of Dai Jitao's funeral. Mr. Chen declined to answer questions about his political views, only pointing to the current price level as a major economic crisis. However, he hinted that the overall situation may become clear within a week. He also said that after President Chiang retired, he enjoyed游山玩水 and逍遙自在. Mr. Chen is scheduled to leave Guangzhou within days, but has not announced where he will go.

[United Press, Guangzhou, 18th] Chen Lifu denied here today the rumors that he intended to consolidate the Guangzhou group to oppose Acting President Li's policy of compromise with the Communists, claiming that he came to Guangzhou only to visit friends. The various rumors reported have made him very puzzled.

### Sichuan Political Situation Has Been Clarified; Liu Wenhui and Wang Zanxu Fly to Chongqing Together; Zhang Qun Scheduled to Take Office on the 21st

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th] Since Zhang Qun came to Chongqing two days ago, he has successively met with Sichuan Chairman Wang Lingji, Kang Chairman Liu Wenhui, and representatives of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, Yang Shisheng and He Jiwu, and has made progress in discussing issues such as stabilizing the Southwest and building self-reliance.

### ECA Aid to China Proposals Can Be Submitted to Congress Next Week; Lapham Will Attend to Explain

[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] US Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA) Director Hoffman told the Central News Agency reporter today: After Congress concludes its discussion on the European recovery plan, the interim proposals for the aid to China plan will be submitted to Congress. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has concluded this discussion today, but the House Foreign Relations Committee will not be able to complete this work until Thursday of next week at the earliest. The two committees must discuss and prepare for a week before submitting recommendations to Congress. Hoffman said that Lapham will arrive in Washington within ten days and resolve all special issues before the China plan is submitted to Congress, and attend the Congressional Committee to explain the matter. (Gu Weijun requested the ECA to allocate funds to assist Chinese students studying in the United States, see news on page 2)

### There is Still a Chance to Resist the Communist Party

Hang Beike Advocates Aiding China

[Our Newspaper News] New York 18th Broadcast: Former State Department Far East Director Hang Beike said in the Foreign Policy Association: "If the Communist Party controls China, most of Asia will be threatened, and the possibility of us being dragged into a war vortex will also increase. The United States must contain communism in both Europe and Asia at the same time, and China is the best area to start." Columbia University Professor Pei Fo held the opposite view, saying: "If we regard the pitiful government in Guangzhou and Taiwan, where wealthy political refugees are flocking, as another fortress against communism, and waste billions of dollars again, it is extremely dangerous. The situation is so fragmented now, of course there is no need for that." Hang Beike argued: "If China falls into the hands of the Communist Party, the Communist Parties in the south, west, and east of China will inevitably succeed, which is a natural trend. The United States' investments and interests in China, the Philippines, Korea, and Japan will also be greatly threatened at that time, and our allies in East Asia may all be destroyed at that time. If Europe cannot obtain resources and trade from East Asia, the hope of complete recovery will become a bubble. As the power of the Asian Communist Party becomes stronger, the conflict between democratic countries and the Kremlin is more likely to become a 'hot war.' Our various investments in aid to Europe will soon be seized by the Soviet Union. We often hear some unfounded news that the Chinese government is corrupt, incompetent, and hopeless, but we must wake up today and know that the KMT is still preventing the Communist Party from advancing. The area occupied by the CCP so far is less than half of the entire territory of China. The CCP lacks administrative personnel, so although it occupies a lot of land, its rule is actually very fragile. Today, there is at least still a chance to extend the efforts to resist the Communist Party. We should provide moral and material support to this kind of effort to resist the Communist Party."

### CCP Defends Responsibility for Civil War in Broadcasts

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco 18th Broadcast: Today, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia CCP Radio Station published a long editorial by the Xinhua News Agency, entitled "Evaluating Several Answers from the KMT Regarding the Issue of Responsibility for the War," which defended the responsibility for the current civil war in China. The article quoted President Chiang, President Sun, and Acting President Li's documents and speeches, and commented on them, believing that the KMT should be responsible for the war. Regarding the government's accusation that the CCP "delayed in appointing representatives," it proved that "because determining the list of war criminals is a major matter, and too many or too few would be unrealistic, it is necessary to consult with various democratic parties and people's groups, so it was 'delayed' for a period of time, and representatives could not be appointed quickly, causing Sun Ke and others to be quite unhappy; but it will not be long before the list of war criminals can be announced, representatives can be appointed, and negotiations can begin. President Sun cannot say that we are superstitious in force."

[United Press, This City News] While the Shanghai Peace Delegation is discussing ways to end the civil war with the CCP in Beiping, the CCP radio station still...

### Xu Kan and Liu Gongyun Visit Acting President Li; Carefully Study Economic Measures; New Plan Still Needs to Be Approved by the Political Affairs Council

[Our Newspaper News] Minister of Finance Xu Kan, President of the Central Bank Liu Gongyun, and Comptroller-General Long Songzhou have been consulting with various parties in Shanghai for days on new economic measures. After completing their official duties, they flew to Nanjing together yesterday morning at 11:00 AM to visit Acting President Li for instructions. The date for the promulgation of the new economic plan is at the beginning of next week. It is heard that the main points of the content include allowing the free and public sale of gold, the daily posting of silver dollar prices, and the stipulation of the legal ratio between gold and silver. In order to stabilize the economy and prices, the southward transportation of gold and silver from the Central Bank in this city will be prohibited, and the sale of US aid materials will be strengthened.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Amidst the news that the new economic plan is about to be promulgated and implemented, Minister of Finance Xu Kan, President of the Central Bank Liu Gongyun, and some key financial and economic officials flew from Shanghai to Nanjing by plane at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 18th. After Xu and Liu rested briefly after getting off the plane, they visited Acting President Li at 3:30 PM in the afternoon to report on the current financial and economic situation and the price fluctuations in various places, and presented the new economic plan that they had discussed and drafted with various parties in Shanghai to Acting President Li for final instructions. Acting President Li inquired in detail about the current financial and economic situation and made a detailed and careful study of the main points of the new plan, which lasted for an hour, until 4:30 PM, when the two left. It is learned that the new plan still needs to be discussed and approved by the Political Affairs Council before it can be promulgated and implemented. Xu Kan and Liu Gongyun will fly from Nanjing to Guangzhou on the morning of the 19th to present the new economic plan to President Sun for discussion at the Political Affairs Council meeting after seeking instructions in Nanjing on the 18th.

[Another Telegram] Xu Kan and Liu Gongyun visited Acting President Li again at 9:00 PM on the evening of the 18th to conduct a careful study of the economic plan.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] After Xu Kan visited Acting President Li, he told this newspaper's reporter at He Yingqin's private residence: The new economic plan is indeed under discussion and drafting, but it has not been finalized. When the reporter asked whether it still needs to be approved by the Political Affairs Council, Xu replied: "Of course, of course!" When the reporter asked again whether the free and public trading of gold and silver and the issuance of hard currency were allowed, Xu only smiled and did not answer, and hurriedly said goodbye to the reporter.

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 18th] The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has decided to relax the issue of southward transportation of yarn and cloth, but the quantity is still to be decided. Minister Liu Weizhi will go to Shanghai within days. The main task is to discuss opening up the scale of export control in order to strengthen foreign trade.

### Yan Xishan Continues to Contact Various Chiefs; Acting President Li Visited Him Yesterday for a Long Talk

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] After Director Yan Xishan returned to Nanjing from a certain place, he continued to have secret talks with Acting President Li, He Yingqin, Xu Yongchang, and others on the 18th. At 10:30 AM on the morning of the 18th, Acting President Li personally visited Mr. Yan at the China Travel Service Capital Hotel and had a long talk for two hours, leaving at 12:30 PM. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, Xu Yongchang visited and talked for a long time. At about 4:00 PM, Mr. Yan visited He Yingqin and discussed with Xu Kan, Liu Gongyun, and others the issue of foreign exchange settlement for Taiyuan's economy and gasoline required for air transport of grain, which also lasted for more than an hour. He also had a long talk with Xu Yongchang in the evening. Those who visited Mr. Yan on the 18th included Zhang Yaoming and He Yaozu. President Yu Youren hosted Mr. Yan at noon and invited Xu Yongchang, Sun Chu, Zhang Yaoming, Sun Weiru, and others to accompany him.

[United Press, Nanjing, 18th] Yan Xishan's spokesperson today denied rumors that Yan flew to Fenghua last night to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, insisting that Yan did not leave Nanjing. Accuses Acting President Li's peace efforts.

The CCP radio broadcast stated: "The peace measures promulgated by Li Zongren in the past month have shown 'no value,' and Li's orders have not been obeyed." "Some measures announced by Li Zongren to eliminate obstacles to peace have been cancelled by the Executive Yuan." The CCP Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Radio also denounced Li Zongren as "only deceiving the people, while Chiang Kai-shek is pulling the strings behind the scenes." After Li announced his "peace measures," democratic elements were arrested and persecuted the people as before.

### Two Types of CCP Broadcasts; The Content is Not Entirely the Same

[United Press, This City News] The CCP radio station has two types of broadcasts. One is an English code broadcast, which has been received by the United States stationed in San Francisco for three years. During the height of the civil war, it was often the CCP's only contact with the outside world. The second is a Chinese-language broadcast, but the content of the two is not entirely the same. The Chinese-language broadcast is read at a speed that allows for oral dictation, with each word repeated, so that Chinese newspapers and others who pay attention to listening can accurately record it. In the CCP's Chinese-language broadcast last month, it was requested that Acting President Li detain Chiang Kai-shek sincerely, but this warning was not heard in the English-language report. The recent Chinese-language broadcast has once again attracted attention. The Chinese side believes that the Communist side is willing to ease its demands for war criminals. Another broadcast pointed out that the National Government is unable to seek peace, and that Acting President Li cannot control the government area and is even more powerless. According to the Communist side, "the American master" of the National Government ordered it to try to make a comprehensive peace settlement. Unexpectedly, government officials were "frustrated and disorganized" due to the victory of the Communist army and planned to make a partial resistance. There is also a lot of anti-American material in the Chinese-language broadcast, but not as much as in the English-language broadcast.

### Sichuan Peace Promotion Association Established; Proclaims Five Propositions

[Our Newspaper, Chengdu, 18th] The All-Sichuan People's Peace Promotion Association held its inaugural meeting on the 18th, with the participation of more than 1,000 representatives from 52 people's organizations. Chairman He Zongjie said that the association stands in a purely people's position, aiming to eliminate the scourge of war and promote the realization of true peace. The victory or defeat of war lies in the strength of military force, while the success or failure of a career actually lies in the support of the people. Therefore, the efforts of the people will surely achieve the expected goal. The congress passed three telegrams: a declaration, a telegram to Acting President Li and Mr. Mao Zedong, and a telegram to the people's organizations of all provinces and cities across the country, calling for peace, and proclaimed five propositions: (1) Calling on the KMT and the CCP to cease fire on the spot; (2) Stop malicious propaganda; (3) Both sides stop collecting soldiers' rations; (4) Jointly guarantee human rights; (5) Prepare to convene a national peace promotion association of all parties.

### Zhou Yan Talks About the Guiding Principles for Governing Zhejiang; Public Security is the First Priority; No Troops Will Be Stationed in the Cities and Towns of Various Counties

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 18th] This newspaper's reporter drove to the Zhejiang Provincial Garrison Headquarters on Nanping Road on the 18th to visit the newly appointed Provincial Chairman Zhou Yan. Mr. Zhou gave his first official interview with reporters after coming to Zhejiang, humbly saying that he is a soldier and deeply feels the arduousness of the responsibility, but believes that serving his hometown is his bounden duty. He then said: We have learned from the local peace in Beiping, so we must strive for comprehensive peace. Preparing for war is the only way to seek peace. Governing Zhejiang should take public security as the first priority. No troops can be stationed in the cities and towns of various counties. If there are no barracks, temporary camps will be built in the suburbs for stationing. Scattered soldiers and idlers must be suppressed. Hangzhou is still under martial law, so all actions that violate the provisions of martial law, such as strikes and petitions, will be severely punished. All troops stationed in Zhejiang are under my command, so there should be no problem with public security. The reporter then asked whether Chairman Chen's ten-year plan would be continued, to which he replied that he could not talk about it at present.

### Hangzhou Public School Teachers and Staff Retain Ren Xianqun

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 18th] After Hangzhou Mayor Ren Xianqun resigned, public school teachers and staff have been retaining him, because he can solve the livelihood problems of public school teachers and staff with a bold spirit. Although Mr. Ren had been at odds with the business community due to increasing the city treasury, he did not apportion to merchants when the large army passed through the territory, so merchants also expressed regret at Mr. Ren's resignation.

### Tell the Truth and Do Practical Things!

Yan Xunfu Talks About the Guiding Principles of Administration; Determined to Promote Benefits and Eliminate Harm for the People

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 18th] The newly appointed Mayor of Hankou, Yan Xunfu, attended his first press conference this afternoon, breaking away from the official clichés of the past and using a frank and sincere tone to explain his administrative principles, saying: "I don't want to be an official, and I won't mess around, so I don't want to talk about grand plans. But I have the courage to change customs, and I will be responsible for repairing the sewers, reorganizing finances and taxation, so that income is not leaked or disturbed, and expenditures are not inflated or abused, in order to stabilize social order and truly promote benefits and eliminate harm for the people. In short, I want to tell the truth and do practical things, and I will never apply plasters." Mr. Yan believes that nothing is scary, only being unmotivated and unscrupulous. Talking about the current situation, he said: "The situation has developed to this day, not because the Communist Party has three heads and six arms, but because we are not united internally and our will is not unified. At present, if we want to reverse the situation, we must communicate the will of all parties and effectively link up the promising provinces in order to strive for comprehensive peace with a common force." Mr. Yan emphasized that the Communist Party is not scary, what is scary is separatism and division. The actions of Liu Wenhui in Sichuan must be corrected. Finally, Mr. Yan frankly declared that he is determined to condense the strength of all parties with effective methods and firmly believes that unity can be formed.

It is also learned that Acting President Li has strongly invited Li to take office as Chief Aide. Although Li is still considering it, the possibility of acceptance is quite high. The selection of a candidate to fill the vacant position of Hainan Chief Executive will be discussed and decided by Sun Ke, Yu Han-mou, and Xue Yue.

Editorial

### Mr. Raymond P. McConnell Returns to the US to Report on His Work

Raymond P. McConnell, Director of the China Branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), returned to the United States to report on his work and departed from Shanghai for the U.S. by plane the day before yesterday. Our newspaper's reporter inquired with the spokesperson of the branch regarding the purpose of Mr. McConnell's return. It was reported that: The main task of this trip is to report on the work of the China Branch to ECA Director Hoffman. The duration of his stay in the United States is currently undetermined. As for whether Mr. McConnell will suggest to Director Hoffman to increase aid to China, they are unable to comment before Mr. McConnell submits his report to Hoffman.

Mr. McConnell's return to the U.S. to report on his work is a routine matter. However, in today's unstable Chinese political situation, whether U.S. aid will continue has become a matter of great concern for the people of the country. Moreover, before Mr. McConnell left China to return to the U.S., he made a trip to Guangzhou to meet with President Sun and Vice President and Foreign Minister Wu, which must have had a significant relationship to the aid policy to China. It is conceivable that Mr. McConnell stated in Guangzhou that he would return to the United States to request the United States to expand its foreign aid program, or extend the current aid to China program beyond March 4th, etc. Although this has been denied by the spokesperson of the China Branch, it is believed that it is not entirely without basis. After Mr. McConnell arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 14th, Finance Minister Xu immediately visited him with Central Bank President Liu to discuss the use of U.S. aid for a long time; at the same time, Ambassador Stuart also came to Shanghai from Nanjing to consult with Mr. McConnell. In addition, General Yan Xishan, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, who is tenaciously defending the besieged city, also flew from Taiyuan to Shanghai to visit Mr. McConnell, who was about to return to the U.S., to discuss the issue of airdrops to Taiyuan, and General Yan's defense of Taiyuan has always been valued by the United States. Judging from these various aspects, this trip of Mr. McConnell's return to the U.S. to report on his work carries a considerable mission. Whether or not U.S. aid continues is of concern to the general public, but the universal psychology of the people of the country is to urgently hope that Mr. McConnell can expand U.S. economic aid to China after returning to the U.S.

China is an industrially underdeveloped country. Although it is known as a "country based on agriculture," due to the adherence to old production methods and the lack of improvement, even the farmers, who account for more than 80% of the country's population, are not immune to cold and hunger, and there is no talk of national welfare or people's livelihood. In addition, eight years of resistance against Japan and three years of internal strife have devastated the rural areas, which are the source of food and clothing for the people of the country, completely changing their appearance compared to more than a decade ago. In this situation, for the sake of national revival and economic prosperity, and for the sake of the people's living standards, it is natural to hope that friendly countries can lend a helping hand, and to use this foreign aid as a starting point for economic revival. At the beginning of the victory, the work of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in China and the continuous aid from the U.S. government to China made the benefited Chinese people grateful for the assistance from friendly countries. Unfortunately, for the past three years, firstly, due to internal obstacles in China, the flames of war spread throughout the country, making it impossible for our people to use foreign aid wisely as capital for revival. Secondly, due to the insufficient amount of foreign aid and the mismatch with the demand for materials, even if there was peace and tranquility in the country, it would be difficult for China to embark on the path of industrialization.

In the past three years, the Chinese people have had a nightmare, and the fluctuating attitude of the United States towards aid to China has been especially bewildering. Today, the situation in the state has undergone tremendous changes. Although the term of the U.S. aid to China program is about to expire, President Truman's message to Congress only mentioned the plan to aid Western European countries, and did not mention a single word about China, which not only greatly disappointed the Chinese people, but also made righteous Chinese friends believe it was unwise. Recently, the American public opinion has been critical of the government's attitude towards this matter, which is evident. In order to clarify the domestic situation, President Truman submitted the second work report of the Economic Cooperation Administration to Congress on the 14th of this month. He said: "We are currently engaged in special efforts to ensure that the supplies of the Economic Cooperation Administration are continuously transported to China, so that the areas controlled by the central government of China and the besieged cities of North China can benefit. For example, the cotton of the Economic Cooperation Administration has enabled the gears of China's largest industry to maintain rotation, to supply important cotton fabrics, which are sold not only in the domestic market of China, but also exported to other countries in the Far East." From this report, it can be seen that President Truman himself cannot help but express considerable optimism about the effectiveness of U.S. aid. Finally, President Truman solemnly declared: "U.S. aid to China must be a supplement to China's own efforts to increase production and supply, and cannot replace China's own efforts." The so-called "Heaven helps those who help themselves," President Truman's words are indeed words of wisdom, and are worthy of deep reflection by the Chinese people.

Every kind-hearted Chinese person originally regarded "self-reliance" as a golden rule. However, if there is no assistance from foreign aid and we rely solely on our own strength, then the process of "rejuvenation" will inevitably be delayed. We earnestly hope that the U.S. authorities will take a long-term view, without hesitation, and continue to intensify aid to the suffering Chinese people. We deeply hope that Mr. Raymond P. McConnell can convey the feelings and wishes of the Chinese people to the American government and the public!

### Communist Side in Beiping Establishes Foreign Affairs Bureau

To Serve as Intermediary Between Foreigners and the Authorities

### Beiping People's Daily Continues to Attack American Reporters

Students to Negotiate Death Sentence for Xu Huidong

[United Press Correspondent Jean Beiping 17th Dispatch] (Delayed) The semi-official "People's Daily" continues to attack United Press reporter Musa and the reporter himself. The reason for the attack on the reporter is that the reporter reported on February 5 that all employees of the CCP-taken "Beijing Hotel" received equal wages. The "People's Daily" denounced this as inaccurate.

If this report is indeed inaccurate, then the reporter can point out that this information came from a direct source. At the same time, before the new government establishes some contact with foreign news agencies, we have no way to verify its accuracy.

Obviously, the drafts of telegrams sent by foreign reporters are checked by the telegraph bureau.

The "People's Daily" concluded its news with a statement saying: "There is a very obvious fact, that is, the people of Beiping will not silently endure the slander of reporters."

The newspaper also released another message stating: The Beiping Student Federation demanded that the Military Control Commission ask reporters to make a public apology and expel Musa and the reporter from Beiping.

### Connally Reiterates U.S. Position on Atlantic Pact - Guarantees Assistance Against Any Aggression, U.S. to Retain Initiative on Measures to be Taken

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 17th] President Truman insists on his belief that the proposed North Atlantic Treaty serves as a prior notice and clear evidence that the countries participating in the treaty will unite to resist any armed attack. He reiterated this belief at today's press conference. He first announced it last month in his inaugural address. President Truman declined to answer further questions about the treaty but pointed out that Acheson had consulted with him before holding a press conference on Wednesday, and Acheson and he were in complete agreement.

[United Press, Washington, 18th] Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated on the 18th that the Atlantic Treaty would be "worse than useless" without the support of a supermajority in the Senate. This advice has been conveyed to Secretary of State Acheson. Acheson is scheduled to present a brief to the committee on the afternoon of the 18th regarding the U.S. position in the negotiations. Connally told reporters that the strength of this anti-aggression treaty lies in the clear understanding by Western Europe that the United States will firmly support the treaty, which stems from Congress's power to declare war. He stated, "Even if the treaty is approved by the necessary two-thirds majority vote in the Senate, it is still insufficient. Without unanimous support, the treaty may be worse than useless." Connally continued, even if the House does not review the agreement, House support is also essential because the House has the same say in matters of declaring war. Connally also stated that he believes the following two articles in the current Western Hemisphere defense treaty may be compatible with the new European agreement: (1) A prior guarantee that the United States will "assist in dealing with aggression," but with a reservation that the decision on what swift steps the United States should take remains in the hands of the United States. (2) A majority of the contracting states may order steps other than war, such as severing diplomatic relations and suspending trade and transportation. Acheson will likely meet with the ambassadors of Canada, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and other groups involved in the treaty negotiations in the next few days, and he will inform them of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's reaction to the current wording of the treaty.

China and European countries cannot prevent the infiltration of communism, and the Siamese government will take various steps to prevent its people from being infected with pro-communist ideas. Even in wartime, the power of public opinion is stronger than weapons, so the government must control the news. He said this action is for the benefit of all 18 million people in the country.

Rumors in Tokyo Denied by Royall

### Panyushkin Accuses U.S. of Monopolizing Japanese Economy - Preserving Japanese Zaibatsu, U.S. Regrets Soviet Remarks Interpreting U.S. Policy

[United Press, Washington, 17th] Soviet Ambassador to the United States Panyushkin today delivered a 2,000-word statement at this week's regular closed meeting of the Far Eastern Commission, criticizing the U.S. plan to assist Japan's economic recovery and demanding that the commission thoroughly investigate it before deciding on a policy. Panyushkin said that the U.S. government's instructions to the Japanese government on December 10 of last year to strictly control prices and wages was a "bypass" of the Far Eastern Commission, a violation of the commission's rules, and an attempt to sacrifice Japan's economic independence to preserve the interests of U.S. monopoly merchants. The policies unilaterally pursued by the U.S. government in Japan are nothing more than an attempt to preserve the major Japanese zaibatsu that participated in the past aggression and to strengthen their power.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] In response to Soviet Ambassador to the United States Panyushkin's criticism of MacArthur's recent decision on the Japanese economy at the Far Eastern Commission, the U.S. State Department released on the evening of the 17th a statement previously made by the U.S. representative at the Far Eastern Commission, which implied the purpose of Panyushkin's measures and expressed regret at Panyushkin's public criticism.

The West Still Advocates Returning Trieste to Italy

However, the representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France replied that the three governments advocate returning the Port of Trieste to Italy.

### Labor Strike on Two Railways Resolved - Shanghai-Hangzhou Trains Can Resume Normal Service Today - Petitioning Workers on Shanghai-Hangzhou Line in Jiaxing Have Returned to Hangzhou

[Reported by this newspaper] The labor strike on the two railways, which has lasted for more than a week, came to an end yesterday morning. The petitioning workers on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, after listening to the new treatment of workers on the Beijing-Shanghai line and in Shanghai late the night before, have returned to Hangzhou. Due to the congestion of military trains and the disruption of traffic due to the continuous labor strike, no trains arrived at the station last night. It is expected that normal service will gradually resume today.

Also, when Wang Zhaohuai, director of the two railway bureaus, met with reporters yesterday, he said: Fortunately, the labor strike on the railway has come to an end. At the beginning of the strike, the employees petitioned for their livelihood, and from a personal standpoint, he expressed deep sympathy. Afterwards, a small number of illegal workers took the opportunity to stir up trouble and incite the labor strike, attempting to use the majority of good workers as tools in order to achieve their conspiracy to disrupt order and cause bloodshed. Fortunately, most of our good employees understand the righteousness, and with the assistance of the police and military department, no bloodshed occurred. Now that the livelihood can be maintained, it is hoped that everyone will stay in their positions and not be used by a small number of illegal elements as a sacrifice.

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 18th] The labor strike on the two railways has been resolved, and trains are running as usual on the morning of the 18th.

The impact on life is extremely deep and great. It is generally hoped that the authorities can take into account the hardship of public education personnel and promptly supervise the supply committee to instruct the Zhongzhi Oil Factory and the Coal Adjustment Committee, which are responsible for the supply, to resume distribution as soon as possible and not delay any longer. If it is believed that there are indeed difficulties in the supply of goods, the difference in money should be issued immediately according to the retail market price in order to maintain the lives of public education personnel.

### 20 Yuan Red Gold Yuan Note - Designs Have Secret Marks - But Different from What is Reported

[Central News Agency report] Some newspapers in the city previously reported that the design of the 20 yuan red gold yuan note printed by the Central Printing Plant contained the four characters "Zhongzheng Downward," which is not entirely accurate. According to the person in charge of the Central Printing Plant, "The secret marks added to the 20 yuan red gold yuan note printed by our plant are not consistent with what is reported outside. The secret marks on the front of the note are 'Hu·F·Zheng·Hang,' and the secret marks on the back are 'P·F·Zhong·Shang,' etc. All of them were printed after being signed and approved by the central government.

### Contingency Funds for Schools; Allocation Agreed Upon; Professors’ Association Conference Resolves to Request Salary Calculation Based on Index

[Our Dispatch] The Municipal National University Professors’ Association held its third conference yesterday afternoon at Fudan University. Three representatives who had petitioned in Nanjing reported on their trip, and discussions were held regarding the allocation of contingency funds and improvement of compensation. Regarding the contingency funds, of the one hundred million yuan initially allocated by the Executive Yuan, it was decided that 15% would be used for student food reserves in the various national universities. The remaining 85% would be allocated to faculty and staff of the schools, with the allocation ratio determined by the number of personnel in each school. In addition to Jiaotong, Fudan, Tongji, Jinan, Shanghai Business College, Shanghai Medical College, Music Academy, and Wusong Merchant Marine Academy, the Kindergarten Teacher Training Academy and Tangshan Engineering College will also be included in the allocation.

Regarding compensation, prices are now many times what they were on August 19th, but professors are still being paid at 15 times the former rate, resulting in monthly income of only around 2,000 yuan. Although the Executive Yuan has discussed adjusting this to 75 times the former rate, this is still far from reflecting actual prices. In order to fundamentally solve this problem, the conference decided to send a telegram to Acting President Li and the Executive Yuan, requesting that salaries be calculated based on the price index.

The fourth conference of the Professors’ Association is scheduled to be held on the 23rd at Tongji University.

In consideration of this, the deadline for government employees of all bureaus and departments of the municipal government to pay school fees is extended to the end of February. All schools must first admit the students and may not delay or cancel their enrollment on the grounds of delayed payment of fees."

### Chamber of Commerce Cables Headquarters Requesting Troops to Vacate Warehouses

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to the General Headquarters of the Garrison Command of Nanjing, Shanghai and Hangzhou, and the Garrison Command of Shanghai and Wusong, requesting that they order the troops stationed in the second warehouse of the Litai Enterprise Company to evacuate immediately. The original telegram stated: "In the past two months, the number of troops stationed in Shanghai has increased, and the number of troops passing through has also been continuous. The regulations for troop transit and lodging, as stipulated by the Executive Yuan in June of the 37th year [1948], have not been followed. Instead of setting up tents and camping in the open, schools, factories, merchant warehouses in the suburbs and urban areas, or unfinished private houses, have been occupied. It is common to use water, electricity, and furniture at will, resulting in a chaotic mess. Commercial and industrial operations have been suspended, and school classes have been affected. Various industries have repeatedly appealed to the authorities in two reports, but only a few have complied and vacated the premises, causing great distress. Although the situation is extremely tense, reducing a bit of disturbance in the relatively stable southeast area is of great importance to national unity, public morale, and maintaining local construction. We hope you will take this into consideration. Furthermore, Article 7 of the [Garrison Command's] Public Notice No. 393, dated February 8th, prohibits "forcible occupation of civilian houses" by officers and soldiers of all organizations. The term "civilian houses" is contrasted with public buildings and includes all buildings used for commercial purposes, not just residential houses. The second warehouse of the Litai Enterprise Company is used to store goods deposited by merchants, which is of utmost importance and requires responsible safekeeping. How can anyone other than the warehouse employees be allowed to occupy the premises at will? Based on the information in the letter, we are sending this telegram to your office for review, requesting that you strictly order the occupying troops to evacuate immediately, so as to maintain the warehouse's proper operation and protect the property rights of the people."

Then, the entire parade and divisional review were conducted, lasting 45 minutes. Commander-in-Chief Tang then addressed all the police officers, saying that he was very pleased to see the serious spirit and orderly ranks of all comrades. Shanghai is the economic center of the country. After eight years of arduous fighting, all unequal treaties were abolished, and Shanghai was completely returned to the motherland from the hands of foreigners. This is the price of eight years of war, and today it is up to our police comrades to protect it. You should demonstrate a high degree of combat spirit to defend Shanghai, which is to fulfill your duty and responsibility, and to be worthy of the comrades who sacrificed in the eight years of war. In the past three years, the Shanghai police have exerted great strength. In the future, all comrades should continue to uphold the spirit of the past three years, and under the leadership of Mayor Wu, Commander Chen, and Director Yu, work together with one heart and one mind to fulfill their responsibility to protect Shanghai and coexist with Shanghai. After Tang's speech, Mayor Wu and Commander Chen delivered separate speeches. Mayor Wu first pointed out two responsibilities: one is the common responsibility, that is, everyone should work together with one heart and one mind to protect Shanghai, and must have the spirit of going through fire and water; the other is the responsibility of himself and Director Yu to all the police officers, that is, how to stabilize their lives.

He hoped that all police brothers would work hard to fulfill their duties and responsibilities. Commander Chen said that the police are the force for stabilizing society and protecting the people. In the future, he is willing to work with all Shanghai police comrades to jointly fulfill their responsibility to protect Shanghai and serve the people. After the speeches, all the police officers marched from Zhongzheng Park, through North Sichuan Road, Nanjing Road, and Xizang Road, to the Great World and disbanded.

### Real Estate Agent Leads to Arrest of Major Thieves; Six Arrested at Qichang Hotel, All Military Personnel; Investigation Reveals Repeated Robberies and Murders; Retelling of Eventful Past

[Our Dispatch] Real estate agent Tao Jianhua, from Pudong, over forty years old, resides at No. 24, Baokang Lane, Linsen Middle Road. On April 21, 1947, Tao was robbed by six armed bandits, losing gold bars, jewelry, and luxurious clothing, estimated to be worth about 100 taels of gold. The case was reported to the police authorities for investigation, but the criminals were never apprehended. Unexpectedly, at around 2:00 PM yesterday, Tao was passing by Daxin Street, Hubei Road, when he suddenly encountered a military-looking man with pockmarks on his face, who seemed familiar. After careful consideration, he suddenly remembered that the military man was one of the six thieves. He followed him to a room on the upper floor of the Qichang Hotel on Hankou Road. Hearing some noise inside the room, he remained calm and went to the Laozha Police Sub-bureau to report. Zhang Kuidong, the chief of the criminal section, ordered Inspector Wang Anbang to lead officers such as Song Jiabao and Tao Jianhua to rush to the hotel in a police car. They saw six military men slowly walking downstairs. After being identified by Tao, the officers stepped forward and took them all to the bureau for interrogation. Three guns were found on the suspects. According to Tao, after the robbery, on August 12th of the same year, two men in military uniform holding handguns suddenly arrived at around 5:00 PM, claiming to have been sent by the First Pacification Command, arbitrarily beating people and destroying furniture before leaving. They repeatedly came to cause trouble. Unable to bear it, he sent a letter to the Pacification Command for inquiry. The reply stated that no one had been sent. It is reported that the group of bandits had robbed eleven fishing families along the coast of Nantong last year. Before leaving, they tied up all the victims and threw them into the sea. At that time, the families of the victims reported to the Garrison Command for investigation. As a result, three accomplices were arrested. However, the ringleader, named Yuan Guoxiang, used the name of the Pacification Command to return the three accomplices to Nantong for release. In the end, he killed all the family members of the victims. Yuan and others remained at large. After learning about this, the Garrison Command issued a warrant for Yuan's arrest, but he was never found. The Garrison Command repeatedly sent people to Tao's residence to inquire about Yuan's whereabouts and asked for assistance, but Tao also did not know his whereabouts. According to the six military men brought to the bureau, their names are Yuan Guoxiang, Yuan Guozhen, Zhuang Bingliang, Geng Huaichen, Lu Quan, and Li Jiabin. Tao also telegraphed the Garrison Command in the police bureau to send an officer to identify Yuan as the wanted criminal. After the sub-bureau asked Director Yu for instructions, he ordered that the original defendants be sent to the Criminal Investigation Section of the General Bureau for interrogation and verification.

### Strong Air of Short Selling; Cotton Yarn Prices Drop Across the Board; Weak Market Sentiment in Cloth Market

The cotton yarn market is slow, with few interested buyers. Coupled with tight credit and frequent rumors of short selling, new buyers are hesitant, and market sentiment is weak. Prices for all types of yarn have plummeted.

43-count Blue Phoenix opened at 590,000 yuan, the previous day's support level, but due to weak buying interest, many floating orders were sold off in succession, eventually closing at 500,000 yuan, a decrease of 90,000 yuan. Other yarns, such as Tiannv and Jincheng, also showed weakness. 40-count Blue Phoenix fell by 70,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon declined gradually from 440,000 yuan to close at 400,000 yuan, a drop of 50,000 yuan.

21-count Double Horse opened at 350,000 yuan, eventually closing at a low of 300,000 yuan, a decrease of 40,000 yuan from the previous day. Off-market trading was at 320,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse dropped by 50,000 yuan to close at 280,000 yuan. Other Jincheng and Tiannv yarns also closed at low levels. All grades of 16-count and below also declined.

The upward momentum in the cotton cloth market has waned. This is due to tight credit conditions, a saturated market, and the upcoming release of new economic measures, causing great apprehension. Small investors, under pressure to raise funds, have been selling off, leading to a weakened market.

Laba Tong Fine Cloth dropped from 12,550 yuan to close at 12,300 yuan, a decrease of 1,600 yuan. B Longtou Fine Cloth fell by 1,700 yuan to close at 12,000 yuan. Other fine cloths, such as Santao and Da Shuanglong, also followed the downward trend.

Sijunzi Yuan Broadcloth initially opened at 13,000 yuan, and even rose to 13,200 yuan. But news of the decline in Black Red fabric caused the momentum to falter, eventually closing at 12,250 yuan, a decrease of 2,100 yuan. Sijunzi Yuan Straight Cloth dropped from 12,700 yuan to close at 12,000 yuan, a decrease of 1,900 yuan. Prices from other cloth factories also opened lower by about 2,000 yuan.

China Textile Corporation Yarn Sales

China Textile Corporation sold 13 types of yarn yesterday, with 41 bidders. A total of 96 lots were sold, amounting to 38.81 million yuan. The selling prices were: 8-count Sunlight at 130,000 yuan, 15-count Fengnian at 230,000 yuan, 16-count Red Moon at 235,000 yuan, 16-count Palace Maid at 240,000 yuan, 20-count Hongfu at 270,000 yuan, 32-count Happy Crane at 370,000 yuan, 32-count Double Strand Fengnian at 450,000 yuan, 40-count Red Shiguang at 440,000 yuan, 40-count Sunlight at 450,000 yuan, 42-count Double Strand Longmen at 460,000 yuan, 40-count Three Strand Red Baoguang at 460,000 yuan, 60-count Palace Maid at 650,000 yuan, and 80-count Double Strand TK Caiqiu at 1.33 million yuan.

### Credit Conditions Initially Stable, Then Tight

Credit conditions in the market were stable yesterday morning. Non-financial institutions generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards future price trends, resulting in a decrease in demand and an abundant supply of funds. Interbank lending rates remained between 70 yuan and 80 yuan per day, equivalent to a monthly rate of over 2%. Credit conditions tightened near noon, with a very frequent turnover.

Cash remained scarce in the market yesterday, due to urgent demand from shipping companies to avoid high exchange rates. The Central Bank of China has issued nearly 5 billion yuan worth of red 100 yuan notes in the past three days, but the reserve funds continue to dry up, and banks are strictly limiting withdrawals, with a premium of about 4%.

### Gold Bond Prices Rise Again

The official exchange rate for short-term gold bonds was set yesterday by the National Bank at 75,000 yuan per tael. A total of 300 taels of gold bonds were sold by the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, the Fourth Bank, and the China Trust Bureau in the city.

### Stock Exchange Prepares for Reopening: Held Regular Board Meeting Yesterday

The Stock Exchange held a regular board meeting at 4:00 PM on the 18th. Attendees included Chairman Du Yuesheng, directors Xu Jilü, Wang Zhishen, Xu Weiming, Zhuang Shuhao, and General Manager Gu Shanchang. The following major resolutions were passed: (1) The draft regulations for listing short-term gold bonds were approved, divided into spot and futures. (2) After the Stock Exchange reopens, it is tentatively set to conduct only one market session initially. However, when gold bonds are listed and auctioned, it will simultaneously change to two market sessions, from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM. (3) The reopening announcement was approved. (4) Regarding account reconciliation after reopening, a circular was sent to all brokers to handle it carefully. (5) The draft regulations regarding technical matters related to reopening trading were approved. (6) Gu Shanchang will host a reception for the directors and supervisors of the Brokers Association at 10:30 AM on the 19th, and for reporters from various newspapers at 2:00 PM. A joint meeting of directors and supervisors will be held at 4:00 PM to make the final approval of the above resolutions.

### Reorganizing US Dollar Bonds

Ministry of Finance Formulates Regulations and Submits to the Executive Yuan for Approval

Regarding the measures for reorganizing foreign currency bonds, the Executive Yuan has approved the principles and instructed the Ministry of Finance to formulate specific measures and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Ministry of Finance has now complied with the order and submitted the "Regulations for Reorganizing US Dollar Bonds of the 38th Year" to the Executive Yuan, which will be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance will issue three types of bonds, namely A, B, and C, to exchange for US dollar bonds for which principal and interest have not yet been paid in the past. 1. Type A bonds will be exchanged for short-term treasury bills of the 36th year of the Republic of China, first and second series. 2. Type B bonds will be exchanged for US dollar bonds of the 37th year of the Republic of China, British pound and US dollar bonds, and the Allied Victory US dollar bonds of the 31st year of the Republic of China. 3. Type C bonds will be exchanged for construction bonds of the 29th year of the Republic of China, first series of US dollar and British pound bonds. All three types of bonds will be exchanged at a one-to-one ratio based on the face value of the bonds. Principal and interest will be paid in US dollars upon maturity. The repayment period will be extended. The total amount of reorganized bonus bonds is over 130 million US dollars.

### Repayment of US Dollar Savings Certificates to Proceed According to Original Regulations

Regarding the repayment method for US dollar savings certificates, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that payment would be made in Gold Yuan based on the Shanghai designated bank's foreign exchange listed price on October 1, 1947. However, there were no clear regulations on how to handle savings certificates purchased in US dollars on that day. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed the Central Bank, stating that the US dollar savings certificates had already been approved by the Executive Yuan to be redeemed according to the Shanghai designated bank's foreign exchange listed price on October 1, 1947. If these savings certificates, which have been exchanged for US dollar drafts, are requested for redemption domestically, they should be handled according to the aforementioned regulations of the Executive Yuan.

### Tight Credit, High Interest Rates in the Black Market; Rice Prices First Rise, Then Fall; Flour, Grains, Oil, and Cakes All Decline

Yesterday, the rice market first rose and then fell. The initial market saw prices rise due to the excessive increase in household rice prices and public panic. With merchants making efforts to raise prices, they rose at one point. Later, due to tight credit, high black market interest rates, and dealers adopting a wait-and-see attitude with empty positions, the market was ultimately unable to sustain the rise and fell slightly. At closing, top-grade white japonica rice retreated to 10,100 yuan. Other grades of goods slightly caught up with downstream demand. Thin japonica rice was at 10,200 yuan, early rice at 9,900 yuan, special japonica rice at 10,400 yuan, and top-grade white japonica rice in the northern market was fixed, opening at 10,100 yuan.

Flour: The market took a sharp turn downwards due to tight credit and low prices for various goods, causing a weakening of public confidence. In addition, negative news permeated the market, and merchants were eager to sell due to fears of high prices. Initial market sales were good, and merchants struggled, resulting in only a slight drop. Later, with the decline in buyer support and sluggish sales, the market sharply declined. At closing, "Warship" brand flour fell to 3,800 yuan, "Old Car" brand retreated to the 4,000 yuan level, wheat bran dropped by over 10%, and "Fuxin Big Bag" brand flour returned to the 3,000 yuan level.

Grains: Prices fell across the board. Soybean hoarders released large quantities, causing a sharp drop of 20% in broad beans, which were traded at 7,000 yuan. Car beans fell by 2,000 yuan, Pinghu Du beans also fell by over 10%, raw peanuts fell by 10%, Yangzhou raw peanuts retreated to below 20,000 yuan, sesame trading remained active, and market prices generally fell by 1,000 yuan. Sorghum saw little interest, with less than 100 bags traded.

Cooking Oil: Prices declined sharply. Soybean oil fell by over 20%, staying at the 40,000 yuan level. Factory prices also closed at 40,000 yuan. Raw oil retreated sharply by 8,000 yuan, with Jiangbei Ji barrels now traded at 45,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil fell below 40,000 yuan, closing at 36,000 yuan. Sesame oil also declined rapidly by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan amidst a wave of selling. Soybean cakes followed the decline by over 5%, with Renji cakes now priced at 3,200 yuan.

Sugar Prices Decline

Sugar prices on the previous day followed the sharp rise and fall of Gold Yuan notes outside the market. The morning market was mostly bullish. Yesterday, as gold prices continued to decline, public confidence weakened significantly. However, due to the repeatedly low exchange rate of Taiwan currency, the support after the rise remained strong. Number 4/5 "Car" white sugar closed at 1,800 yuan, down 300 yuan, and coarse granulated sugar was at 1,750 yuan, also down 300 yuan. Medium granulated sugar and white cotton sugar were not available on the market and were not traded. Prices of other grades generally fell by 300 to 400 yuan.

Tung Oil Weak and Soft

Although tung oil merchants tried to push prices higher in yesterday's market, the market atmosphere was difficult to maintain due to the weakening support overnight, tight positions among colleagues, and the overall decline in goods outside the market. As a result, both white and red tung oil fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and the underlying support remained weak.

### Silk Prices Continue to Decline

Yesterday, the artificial silk market continued to be weak. Credit in the market was slightly looser, but black market interest rates remained between 80 and 90 yuan, placing a heavy burden on traders, who were eager to sell. T-20 grade bright new goods opened at a low price of 500,000 yuan. Amid reports of continued minor declines in gold prices and weak performance of various goods, public confidence was extremely low, and the market was filled with selling pressure. The market continued to decline, closing at 450,000 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, gold prices rebounded after falling, public confidence stabilized slightly, and the market showed some signs of recovery, with asking prices rising by 10,000 yuan.

Raw silk prices fluctuated with foreign exchange certificates. As black market gold prices continued to decline and artificial silk and cotton yarn prices continued to fall, public confidence did not improve, and the market continued to decline. Top grade opened at 480,000 yuan, finally trading at 470,000 yuan. Other grades such as Chelli Thousand Warp Ordinary and Extra also weakened, and prices declined across the board. The market showed slight signs of recovery in the afternoon, but trading remained sparse, and asking prices for top grade rose slightly by 20,000 yuan.

The silk and satin market was generally weak with slight fluctuations. Meiya quilts opened at 315,000 yuan. After opening, the market received negative news that foreign gold notes and cotton cloth were declining across the board. Rongzhong's credit conditions varied, public confidence was weak, and short selling dominated. The market returned to low levels, falling to the 300,000 yuan level. Later, there was some buying on the decline, and buying sentiment improved slightly. Prices rebounded after falling, but the overall trend was weak, and the outlook was not promising. The market closed at 306,000 yuan, and prices of other grades generally fell by 15%.

### Cigarettes and Soap Recover at Closing

The cigarette and soap market continued its downward trend from the previous day immediately after the market opened. The process was influenced by reports that new economic plans would be announced soon and that illegal speculation would be severely cracked down on, causing general public apprehension. Prices of goods outside the market also fell in response, and cigarettes and soap were no exception, following the decline. Interest rates within the market were stable, around 8%. White tin packages fell sharply by 200 yuan, ten-pack British cigarettes also fell by 300 yuan, and prices of other grades generally fell. However, major players took advantage of the low prices to buy in, and prices recovered slightly. "Guben" brand cigarettes returned to 15,100 yuan, balancing with the previous day. Prices of other miscellaneous brands fluctuated, and matches generally fell by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

### Transportation Control Committee Statement: Explanation of Oil Price Adjustments

Regarding the repeated increases in gasoline and diesel prices, the person in charge of the Transportation Control Committee explained that the determination of various oil prices before August 19 of last year was based on the automatic adjustment formula approved by the Executive Yuan in May of last year. New prices were calculated and implemented by the Transportation Control Committee after reporting for record. Since the currency reform on August 19 and the abolition of price controls, various factors determining oil prices, such as exchange rates, indexes, and freight rates, have continued to rise. Therefore, in October of last year, the Executive Yuan instructed the Transportation Control Committee and the US Aid Utilization Committee to jointly form a Petroleum Price Review Committee, with the cooperation of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, to handle the matter. The committee drafted an oil price calculation formula for reference, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. The formula stipulates that if the aforementioned factors rise beyond the approved limit, the selling price may be adjusted. Therefore, the adjustment of oil prices is jointly determined by the above three institutions and reported to the Executive Yuan for record, and is not something that the Transportation Control Committee can decide alone.

### Three European Distance Runners Cause a Sensation in the United States; Create Many Great Records

[United Press, New York] In American indoor track and field competitions, European distance running experts such as Hägg and Hansson have also failed. However, two other Swedes and one Belgian finally got their wish. This was the highlight of American competitions in January of this year.

Sweden's Bergsson and Alton each won twice in three competitions, and Belgium's Leve, who participated in one competition, won once. Leve is the champion of the 5,000-meter race at the World Games. Holland's Slijkhuis trailed by extremely close distances in all competitions, ranking second. Slijkhuis lost to Bergsson in the Philadelphia mile race on January 21, and lost to America's Gehrman again in the Millrose mile race on January 29. However, Gehrman had to go all out, running a time of 4 minutes and 9.5 seconds to defeat Slijkhuis. The achievements of European distance runners are a surprise, because in the past, Europeans ultimately failed because they were not accustomed to wooden tracks or their physical condition was not good.

This month, there were two performances that equaled world records. One was at the Millrose Games, where Duwa of Rhode Island ran the 60-yard dash in 6.1 seconds. However, this is not a major event, and 14 people have previously equaled this record.

Bergsson won the one-mile championship at the Philadelphia Games in 4 minutes and 1 second, and won the 1,000-yard championship in 2 minutes and 14 seconds at the Boston Games on January 22. However, he later became upset due to toothache and a misfortune to his son, so he failed in the one-mile race at the Millrose Games.

Sweden's Alton won the two-mile race at the Philadelphia Games in 9 minutes and 12 seconds, and his time at the Boston Games was 9 minutes and 3.2 seconds, setting a record for the event. In the two-mile race at the Millrose Games, Leve won with a time of 8 minutes and 56.1 seconds, and Alton was second with 8 minutes and 56.6 seconds. In the one-mile race at the New York Games, Slijkhuis and Gehrman both tied with 4 minutes and 9.5 seconds, but Gehrman was clearly ahead at the finish line.

Dillard was the most watched person in various competitions last year, but he is now colorless. Although he can steadily win the hurdles championship, as in 1948, and has equaled the world record, Illiniois's pole vaulting star Rickett had a score of four feet and eight inches at the Poché Games. It is said that he believes he can reach fifteen feet before this season. In history, only one person, that is, Warlmerdam, has vaulted over fifteen feet high. The participation of Europeans in the games obviously has a lot to do with ticket sales. The Philadelphia Games had 10,000 spectators, and the New York Games had 16,000 spectators. The indoor track and field season does not start until the end of January. The results of the main events so far are as follows:

One Mile - Gehrman (USA) 4 minutes 9.5 seconds, Slijkhuis (Netherlands) 4 minutes 9.5 seconds.

Two Miles - Leve (Belgium) 8 minutes 56.1 seconds. Alton (Sweden) 8 minutes 56.6 seconds. One Thousand Yards - Bergsson (Sweden) 2 minutes 14.5 seconds.

Fifty-Yard Hurdles - Dillard (USA) 6.1 seconds, equal world record.

Sixty-Yard Dash - Duwa (USA) 6.1 seconds, equal world record.

Long Jump - Rickett (USA) 14 feet 8 inches.

High Jump - Wesoloski (USA) 6 feet 7 and 3/4 inches.

Six Hundred Yards - Gott (USA) 1 minute 12.5 seconds.

Eight Hundred Eighty Yards - Comfort (USA) 1 minute 54.2 seconds.

Sixty-Yard Hurdles - Dillard (USA) 7.3 seconds.

Thirty-Five Pound Hammer - Fulton (USA) 57 feet 9 and 1/2 inches.

Long Jump - Giles (USA) 22 feet 8 and 2/1 inches.

Sixteen Pound Shot Put - Meyer (USA) 52 feet 2 and 1/2 inches.

### Southern China: A Fortress of Stability: Surveying Yulin Port

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper: Liang Zhi

[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Hainan Island, 12th] Hainan’s southern region, isolated overseas and hampered by transportation difficulties, remains largely unfamiliar to people in the mainland. However, the security, military, and political situation of Yulin Port in southern Hainan, along with the local customs and traditions, are truly worth reporting. People in the mainland are also urgently seeking clarity on these issues. Therefore, after on-site observations, the reporter has written a brief and factual account of the situation below for the reference of those generally concerned about the current state of Southern China.

Surrounded by Mountains

Yulin Port in southern Hainan, located in the tropics, enjoys a year-round climate resembling early summer. The scenery is picturesque, the sea is vast, and the skies are expansive. Those who have seen the film "Mermaid of the South China Sea" may be able to imagine the enchanting beauty of this place. Although a few small islands lie to its south, it is essentially China's southernmost national defense frontier, a vital base for land, sea, and air forces, a strategic hub in the southwestern Pacific, and the future political and economic center of Hainan Island. If Hainan Island's restructuring is realized, Yulin will likely become the site of a permanent provincial capital due to its inherent advantages and the seven years of painstaking construction by the Japanese. Yulin's naval docks are surrounded by mountains and water, the harbor is wide and deep, and it can accommodate warships of over 10,000 tons. It currently possesses modern fortress artillery facilities comparable to those of Keelung and Kaohsiung. Especially the eastern and western artillery positions at the harbor entrance are in a very strategic position, resembling the pincers of a crab, overseeing the inner and outer harbors. In times of war, they can be used to close the port at any time. The harbor controls the entire Yulin area, guarding the vanguard of national defense, and is a stable fortress for southern China and the cradle for the future development and construction of a new Hainan.

Beyond the Turmoil

Some have predicted that Yulin Port will be the Hong Kong and the Shanghai of the future. Undoubtedly, in a turbulent and suffering nation, it will stride towards the great era with a heroic and striking posture. Although the island is not yet completely pacified, the Yulin (Sanya Hongsha) area in southern Hainan, and even the area between Ya (County), Teng (Qiao), and Ling (Shui) on the periphery, along the public (rail) road line, can be said to have good security, and the people's lives are relatively stable. Sitting in command here is General Nie Qi, commander of the Hainan Island Fortress. General Nie is a standard military man, dark-skinned and robust, with piercing eyes and a loud voice, instantly recognizable as a resolute, courageous, and skilled fighter. He arrived in Yulin in November of the 37th year and took office.

Prospering Yulin

In recent months, he has concentrated all his efforts on seeking coordination and unity between the party, government, and military, rectifying troop discipline, promoting cooperation between the military and civilians, and striving for progress and development from the stability of the fortress defense area. He also serves as the commander of the Southern District Suppression of this island, adhering to the instructions of Commander Han; coordinating with assigned troops, actively restoring automobile road traffic, and dispatching teams to protect local autumn harvests, so that goods flow smoothly, people have access to food, stabilize prices, stabilize people's livelihoods, and prosper Yulin. Although Yulin Port is not a large city, with a population of just over 20,000 according to statistics from the Yulin Police Station, it is filled with institutions. In addition to the Fortress Headquarters, there is the Sanya Air Force Station and Guard Battalion, the Naval Patrol Office and the Fourth Guard Battalion, the 391st Regiment of the 131st Army Division, police sub-stations, army and navy supply stations, as well as the large-scale Hainan Iron and Steel Bureau (equipped with a Mine Police Corps), the Hainan Railway Administration, the Yaxian County Party Headquarters, the Yulin District Party Headquarters, the Yulin-Asia Salt Field Public Office of the Ministry of Finance, the Fisheries Management Office, the Guangdong Branch, the preparatory office of the Hainan Aquatic Products Company of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Yulin-Asia Agricultural and Forestry Experimental Farm, as well as post offices, telegraph offices, the China Farmers Guangdong and other banks. In terms of culture, there is the Yulin-Asia Middle School, the Iron Mine Elementary School, the Salt Workers' Children's School, the Heping Daily, the Daguang Daily resident office in Sanya, and the Qiongya Communications Branch. Since its official establishment on New Year's Day, the Yulin-Asia Military-Police Joint Inspection Office, which has been organized here by the land, sea, and air forces for a month, has had personnel stationed at each unit of the sea, land, and air forces to assist in the implementation of the following matters: (1) strictly enforce military discipline, (2) thoroughly investigate the population of each district and re-register, (3) inspect passengers on incoming and outgoing ships and aircraft, and regularly set up stations to inspect incoming and outgoing vehicles, (4) strictly prohibit opium and gambling, eliminate spies, and (5) tidy up the city appearance. It is generally believed that southern Yulin will improve daily from now on, and Yulin Port will surely have a new atmosphere in the future.

External Transportation

Hainan Island is isolated overseas, and external transportation is extremely difficult, especially for Yulin Port in the southern part of the island. At present, in addition to the bi-monthly China Airlines flights, there is no regular schedule for ships sailing the Yulin-Haikou-Guangzhou line. The transportation of local products from Yulin to Haikou and Huangliu Beili is mostly reliant on civilian ships. Civil servants and teachers here feel a great headache when they encounter job transfers. It is heard that the Fortress Headquarters recently sent a letter to the Shanghai China Aviation Corporation, requesting that the bi-monthly flights be changed to weekly flights to facilitate the delivery of official documents, which has been agreed to. Recently, BC3C-4 type small aircraft have been reassigned, and an additional weekly flight is being planned. In addition, negotiations are being held with the Shanghai office of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to regularly dispatch ships to sail the Hainan-Yulin-Guangzhou line. It is expected that external transportation may see significant improvements.

Salt Field Management

The salt fields in the Yulin-Asia (Sanya) Port area of ​​Southern Hainan are quite impressive. Everywhere you can see fields stretching as far as the eye can see. The salt fields are an indication that salt production here is quite large scale. Since post-war restoration, various salt producers have been struggling to operate. The devastation suffered in the past under the enemy and puppets has gradually been restored, but when the salt fields were repaired during the restoration, it was mostly done in a makeshift manner due to economic constraints. Therefore, according to statistics from the Yulin-Asia Salt Works, salt production here last year was only more than 200,000 dan, which is far from the pre-war annual production of more than 300,000 dan. Last December, the Agricultural Bank also piloted salt loans, so the repair work of the Yulin-Asia salt producers was quite active and full of life. At the beginning of January this year, the Asia branch manager of the salt works led a team to Guangzhou for reassignment. The new branch manager, Wang Dehui, emphasized the increase in production as soon as he took office, setting the highest target for salt production this year at 420,000 dan. The salt industry is very important to the lives of the islanders and is a major source of income. In addition, the salt fields of Yinggehai in the Yaxi district are the most large-scale. During the period of occupation, the Japanese spent years of effort planning. The construction of the project has a basic foundation, and the Japanese originally intended to create the second largest salt field in the world, planning to supply the military and civilian food needs of the Southwest Pacific and their own country. Unfortunately, only one-tenth or two-tenths were built before the Japanese declared an unconditional surrender. After the victory, due to national affairs, successive military operations, and the banditry on the island, the government did not have time to take care of it, resulting in its abandonment, which is truly regrettable. Last spring, Director Song of the Guangzhou Administrative Office sent a team to develop the Yinggehai salt field, led by Commissioner Wu Zhixian and engineering experts Wu Lüzhong and Zhu Shenwen, to Yulin, and then went to Yinggehai to conduct on-site inspections. It is expected to complete the entire project in two to three years. The manpower, machinery, and funding for development are set at 6 million Hong Kong dollars. After the construction is completed, it can produce 30,000 dan of salt per day, and about 3 million dan per year (except during the rainy season). If this great plan can be realized as soon as possible, then the annual salt production will not only be sufficient to supply the national food supply, but also can be used for national defense and military needs, and can be sold to the international market to increase national income. This is of great importance to people's livelihood, national construction, and the future of island development and construction. It is a pity that the development of the salt fields has not yet seen any practical action, which really makes the islanders feel very disappointed.

Fisheries and Aquatic Products

Yulin Port is not only a rich and fertile area, but also a city of fisheries and aquatic products. Most of the people in the southern part of the island rely on it for a living. Although they use traditional methods for fishing and lack scientific technology and new fishing boats, the results are still quite impressive, and it is a major export product of local products every year. Last year, the Fisheries Management Office moved its Guangdong branch from Guangzhou to Hainan and sent new fishing boats to operate. The results have been remarkable over the past year. If it can be actively developed, it is hoped that the largest fishery station in South China can be established, and the future will be limitless. In addition, the Marine Products Company, which has been in preparation here for many years, is said to be officially established recently. It can be predicted that the future of southern Hainan's aquatic products and fisheries will become increasingly developed.

### Zhenjiang Dredging Committee: Flour Being Divided: Assembly Cables County Government Requesting Thorough Investigation

[Dispatch from This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 17th] Here, the sandbars on the river surface are gradually extending outward. Local communities have organized a Dredging Committee and obtained approval from the provincial government to collect additional charges on shipping tickets to fund dredging. At the county assembly meeting on the 16th, assembly member Bu Yulin proposed that the Dredging Committee, in recent years, had only spent money on personnel appointments, and no dredging work had been carried out. Recently, the chairman of the committee, Leng Yuqiu, left Zhenjiang for Shanghai. A few committee members, using the pretext of turbulent times, actually divided up several thousand bags of flour that the committee had accumulated over the years under the guise of "storage." This is a mere formality and is akin to dividing up public property. It should be requested that the county government investigate and order its return by cable. It was decided that, in addition to cabling the county government to investigate and order its return, the handling of dredging funds in the future would be discussed and decided at the sixth general meeting to be held on the first of next month.
