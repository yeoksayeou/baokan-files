The peace envoys, longed for by the people of the entire nation, have finally set out. Some people view this as an optimistic sign for the future of peace. On the 13th, the weather in Shanghai was clear and pleasant. The delegation, after receiving notification the previous night, prepared themselves promptly. Therefore, they departed as scheduled on the 13th. This reporter also learned from CNAC on the evening of the 13th that the special plane had safely arrived in Qingdao. However, due to damage to one of the plane's tires, it was unable to fly to Beiping that day. CNAC will send another tire on the 14th to replace it before it can leave Qingdao for Beiping. Those who traveled by plane yesterday included the five representatives, family members of Liu Zhonghua, personal secretaries of each representative, and Jiang Yong's son and daughter-in-law, totaling nineteen people. The original departure time was set for 10:00 AM, but it was delayed by over an hour due to excessive luggage and too many passengers, which had to be reduced temporarily. The plane took off from Longhua Airport. Before departure, the representatives gathered at Yan Huqing's residence at 9:00 AM and arrived at the airport successively at 9:45 AM. At that time, the waiting room at the airport was crowded with people who surrounded the peace representatives. The clear weather made the people on the scene even happier. Those who came to the airport to see them off included Xiang Gongzhan, Cheng Cangbo, He Yaozu, Yu Peihou, Ni Bi, Tao Baichuan, etc. When Pan shook hands with the representatives, he repeatedly wished them success in their trip. Mr. Yan once said: "We have made the greatest efforts to promote peace on this trip." When the reporter asked Mr. Jiang to make a statement, he said: "I have nothing to say, I only hope that this trip will be successful." Mr. Shao, however, disagreed with the "knocking on the door" mission mentioned outside. Mr. Shao said: Knocking on the door means that the door is not yet open. Our task is actually to "push the door." During the waiting time, Gan Jihou negotiated and arranged matters for them, and was extremely busy taking care of the take-off of the plane. The wives of Mr. Yan and Mr. Shao accompanied them and did not leave until the special plane took off and they waved their handkerchiefs. In addition, the delegation expects to complete its mission and return to Shanghai in a week.

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Regarding the issue of postal service between the KMT and CPC areas, the technical aspects still need to be negotiated.

Workers also participated in the parade, and the Communist army maintained order along the way.

[United Press, Beiping, 13th] Mayor Ye Jianying delivered a speech at a meeting here yesterday, saying: "We must arrest war criminals and reactionary leaders who have committed serious crimes.

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 13th] After Dai Chuanxian's death, in order to clarify the truth, reporters made inquiries from relevant parties. According to Dai's son, Dai Anguo: After Mr. Dai's death, his belongings were inspected, and there were no wills or testaments. The rumors outside are purely fabricated. As for the cause of Dai's death, the reporter witnessed the full text of death certificate No. 295 issued by Zhang Mengshi, director of the Affiliated Hospital of the Medical College of Zhongshan University, and attending physician Li Shimei: "Mr. Dai Chuanxian, 60 years old, suffered from heart failure, which suddenly broke out on the morning of February 12, 38th year of the Republic of China, and died at 10:40 AM.

When Mr. Dai fell ill, in order to avoid stimulating Mrs. Dai and affecting her health, although the doctor diagnosed that Mr. Dai could not be saved, she was not informed. With her consent, Mrs. Liu Jiwen, Mrs. Shen Pengfei, and the daughter of Mr. Dai's old friend, Dr. Du, accompanied her to the Central Hospital for treatment. She is currently staying in Room 206 of the Central Hospital, which shows that all kinds of rumors are not true.

### Acting President Li's Broadcast Rescheduled for Tomorrow - Contents Include Rectifying Official Conduct and Military Discipline -

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The content of the broadcast speech to be delivered by Acting President Li is not, as rumored, a reiteration of the government's determination to seek peace with the Communist Party.

The original draft has not been approved on the 13th, and there is no time to broadcast it on the 14th. It will be rescheduled for the 15th.

### A Trip to "Push the Six Representatives": An Empty Record of Peace Envoys

- Our Newspaper Reporter Zhang Ming

The Shanghai Peace Delegation, which the people of Shanghai and even the whole country were looking forward to, finally took off into the clear sky yesterday (the 13th). We saw it soar with ease, but looking back at the crowded send-off at the airport, we felt that it had a heavy responsibility and this flight was not easy.

The representatives' departure time was originally scheduled for 10:00 AM, but it was delayed by an hour due to many trivial matters. The representatives' status at the airport was almost regarded as angels, and they were surrounded by people in layers. Especially the peace elder Shao Lizi, when he was invited to rest upstairs, a piece of paper was immediately added to the door he had crossed, with the words "Gate of Peace" written on it. Who doesn't yearn for peace!

Obviously, the representatives were quite excited by a kind of eager expectation. You see, the elderly gentlemen were busy talking to reporters, until their guardians advised, "Let him rest for a while"! Only then could they rest temporarily.

Today at the airport, photographers from Chinese and foreign newspapers used various angles to record various real records of the representatives. Elder Shao always smiled and patiently allowed everyone to take pictures to their heart's content. They all greeted these enthusiastic expressions with the greatest pleasure.

Some people say that the native places of these representatives happen to be distributed in the east, south, west, and north, which seems to indicate that they represent the opinions of people in every corner of the east, south, west, and north of the country. Elder Yan said: "Today, people in every corner of the world are hoping for peace and feel that peace is precious. The Chinese people have suffered the most, so they yearn for it even more. Our delegation can fly to the old capital in this opportunity to seek peace. It can always be regarded as a progress in the national people's desire for peace. I hope this trip can bring back the answer to the question of the date of formal peace talks and some opinions from the Communist Party, which would be satisfactory." Peace is indeed what everyone hopes for. When the special plane took off, many people shouted: "It's finally gone."

Regarding the task of the peace representative, Elder Shao specially gave a clarification: He believes that "knocking on the door envoy" is really inappropriate, because knocking on the door is used when the door has not been opened, but we are going to push open the door that is only half-closed. What we hope is that the door of peace will be wide open! Many people laughed at that. The peace representative became a push-door representative.

### Nanjing People's Peace Delegation: Mission Completed, Disbanded Yesterday; Issues Statement Denying Reported Negotiations in Beiping

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The People's Peace Delegation officially announced the completion of its mission on the 13th and disbanded on the same day. Six of the seven representatives of the delegation, due to the fact that the reports in the newspapers about the delegation's situation in Beiping were quite different from the facts, gathered on the afternoon of the 13th to discuss how to correct them. Those who participated were Qiu Zhizhong, Deng Jiyu, Zeng Zisheng, Song Guogui, Xia Yuanzhi, and Wu Zhesheng. It was decided: (1) To issue a statement to correct the important points. (2) Acting President Li will invite all the representatives of the delegation to meet on the 14th or 15th. Qiu and others decided not to go. (4) The China People's Peace Promotion Association decided to move to Shanghai and continue to promote peace. The Nanjing office announced its cancellation on the same day. (4) The People's Peace Delegation, jointly formed by the China People's Promotion Association and the National Policy Research Association of Professors from various universities in China, completed its mission and announced the dissolution of the delegation.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Six of the seven members of the People's Peace Delegation who went to Beiping to contact the CPC members issued a statement on the 13th, denying the peace talks carried by the Chinese and foreign newspapers in the past few days, saying that there were facts that did not match the content carried. This matter has a profound impact on the delegation, the KMT and CPC authorities, and the people of the South. Therefore, six important points were put forward to correct them. The statement was signed by Qiu Zhizhong, Deng Jiyu, Zeng Zisheng, Song Guoshu, Xia Yuanzhi, and Wu Zhesheng. The six points of correction were: (1) The delegation did not participate in the presidential palace meeting on the 12th, nor did it plan to meet with any government authorities. (2) It was unheard of that the CPC could make concessions on the two conditions of "war criminals" and "reorganizing the army." (3) It was especially groundless to say that the CPC authorities had specific conditions to be brought back by the delegation. (4) When the delegation contacted the CPC in Qingdao and Beiping, it was not a certain representative who directly spoke to Ye Jianying through private relations. (5) At least six of the seven representatives of the delegation did not meet with Nie Rongzhen and Lin Biao. (6) The United Press reported that the Communist Party would agree to hold peace talks with the Kuomintang within a month, and Ye Jianying guaranteed that the Yangtze River defense line would not be attacked before and during the peace talks. The CPC believes that Acting President Li is insufficient to represent the Kuomintang and does not demand the detention or trial of President Chiang, etc., which is not only purely unfounded, but also approaches rumor-mongering.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Xia Yuanzhi, a representative of the People's Peace Delegation, said on the 13th that the impression gained from this trip to Beiping was that the hope for peace was very slim, but not without hope. He expressed regret over the fact that the talks of a certain member of the delegation, as reported in various newspapers in the past few days, were too different from the facts. It is said that they only put forward opinions to the CPC members from the people's standpoint. The CPC members agreed to forward them to the CPC Central Committee and reply in the broadcast. The CPC did not have any specific conditions to be brought back by the delegation.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Wu Yuhou, a representative of the People's Peace Delegation, said on the evening of the 13th that the delegation had two talks with Ye Jianying in Beiping. Because he had a personal relationship with Ye Jianying, he also had two separate talks. He knew more than the other members of the delegation. He believed that this kind of news that was beneficial to peace should be understood by the people, so he revealed it to reporters. However, the reporter's record was also quite different, such as saying that Acting President Li was participating in the peace talks.

The Communist army has not dared to launch a large-scale attack in the past few days. The traffic between the bridgehead and Zhenjiang is smooth.

[Our Newspaper, Puzhen, 13th] The Communist army has been quite busy mobilizing in the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway and the areas on both sides of the railway in recent days.

Export Trade Center Will Shift from Shanghai to Guangzhou
Many Exporters Go to Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Inspect

According to the import and export industry, recently, due to the difficulty of navigation on the Yangtze River, the transportation of native products from Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Anhui to Shanghai has been inconvenient, resulting in a significant blow to export trade. Last year, Shanghai's export trade reached US$175,823,513.65, accounting for more than 70% of the country's total exports, with bristles ranking first, estimated at approximately US$31 million, followed by tung oil, estimated at approximately US$29 million.

Jin Jiao Spring Cold
Special Correspondent for This Newspaper Ling Songsou

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang 10th] Under the current developments, whether it is peace or war, this fertile region of Southern Jiangsu is the "problem". If it is peace, how should Southern Jiangsu seek stability at the moment? If it is war, how should Southern Jiangsu prepare for "contingency"? The county councils of Southern Jiangsu are now appealing to the government to declare Jiangnan as a "non-defensive zone." However, the communist army in the three mountainous areas (Tianmu Mountain, Huangshan Mountain, West Mountain) on the border of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces has already established the "Political Work Steering Committee of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Region" to deploy and guide all activities of the communist army in this area. Chairman Ding Zhipan said, "Because of the other party's compactness and our laxity, more than 2,000 people can be used as 20 million people. The Communist Party's political legs have already crossed over to Jiangnan!" He wants to strengthen the organization and training of the people in Southern Jiangsu for this purpose, but he encountered opposition from local gentry in Wuxi. He wants to strengthen the efficiency of basic-level administrative work and refresh the atmosphere of basic-level administrative work. He intends to recruit 5,000 young people from a large number of refugee students to engage in local basic-level administrative work, but only more than 500 people have registered after two months. Some Jiangsu Provincial Senators in Shanghai are dissatisfied with Chairman Ding's administration. However, this kind of disconnection between the government and the people still exists today, and it is not just Ding Zhipan's distress.

It snowed in Zhenjiang today, and the three mountains were covered in silver, seeming even more beautiful. Jiao Mountain in the river has difficult ship traffic due to the martial law on the river. Jinshan suffered a major fire last year, and there is no longer anything to celebrate. Although spring is just beginning to descend upon humanity, seeing the loneliness of Jinjiao and facing the snow-covered mountains really makes people feel extra cold.

Changzhou Machine Industry Stalls, More Than 30 Factories Do Not Open
[Our Newspaper Wujin 12th] There are more than 30 machine industries in this county, Wansheng and Housheng. The number ranks second in Jiangsu Province. Last winter, the situation was tense, the economy was unstable, and the industry fell into a slump. Agricultural machinery had no sales at all, and factories had no orders for machine production. Factories were on the verge of collapse. After the Spring Festival, only three or so were able to continue operating. More than 30 factories are in a dilemma and have no power to start work. Workers' lives are in extreme panic. Last year, the government advocated for industrial loans, and factories in this county applied for loans, with various complications, but there has been no news to date. Domestic national banks have never been interested in lending to this industry, causing it to become a fish stuck in a dry rut. The industry has now made an urgent appeal to the society and the government about the crisis, in order to arouse attention.

### Nordic Defense Alliance: Five Basic Principles Agreed Upon; Norwegian Foreign Minister Meets Bevin En Route Home

[United Press, Copenhagen, 13th] Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen announced at a press conference today that Denmark, Norway, and Sweden have reached an agreement on five basic principles of the Scandinavian Defense Treaty, and a detailed agreement can now be established by the foreign ministers' meeting of the three countries. The prime ministers of the three countries will also meet twice in the next three weeks to discuss defense matters. The five basic principles are as follows: (1) Each country of the Scandinavian Peninsula should independently decide to prevent any armed attack by various means. (2) If one country is attacked, the other two countries should provide assistance in military and other fields. (3) The three countries should coordinate their defense plans, armed forces, and weapons production in peacetime. (4) The defense treaty is a regional security agreement established in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. (5) When one country is attacked, it may request assistance from countries outside the alliance.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange arrived here by plane this morning from the United States and told reporters, "We must not act rashly." This statement was in response to the previous statement from Norway that Norway's reply to the recent Soviet note must be submitted to the Soviet Union before he returns home on the 16th. He also said, "I now have a clearer understanding of the situation, and what we should pay more attention to is the facts." A reporter suggested that his trip to the United States had caused a crisis in the drafting of the Atlantic Pact. He replied that this was only the Swedish view and did not correspond to the facts. Lange will meet with Bevin tomorrow to review the issue of Norway's possible participation in the Atlantic Pact. He will leave England on the evening of the 15th or the morning of the 16th to return home.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 12th] Before leaving the United States, Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange hosted the press. When asked if a compromise could be reached between the Scandinavian Security Treaty plan and the Atlantic Pact, he replied that it seemed difficult to do so. He concluded by saying that "we are now in a better position than before to consider future foreign policy."

[United Press, London, 12th] Well-informed sources say that British Foreign Secretary Bevin will assure Turkish Foreign Minister Sadak on the 14th that the North Atlantic Treaty will not reduce British and American aid to Mediterranean countries. Sadak will arrive here tomorrow. His mission is to inquire about the impact of the North Atlantic Treaty on Mediterranean countries.

### Hungary Condemns US Interference in Internal Affairs; US Recalls Envoy; Plans to Appeal to the UN Regarding the Mindszenty Case

[United Press, Budapest, 12th] The Hungarian Foreign Ministry announced tonight that the Hungarian government has requested the United States to recall Ambassador Chapin and Deputy Military Attaché Cooper Sack. It is claimed that the recall of the US ambassador is related to the treason case of Hungarian Cardinal Mindszenty.

[United Press, Budapest, 12th] Hungarian Foreign Minister Rajk issued a statement to the press today on the Mindszenty case, saying that the US and British authorities, in the name of safeguarding religious and human rights, are concealing their interference in Hungary's internal affairs, and the means they use are difficult to agree with. These people defend the fascist defendants in the case, unaware that the treaty they cite is precisely to stop fascism. If Acheson wants to appeal to the United Nations regarding the Mindszenty case, we are also prepared to clarify the truth in that organization.

[United Press, Washington, 12th] The State Department has telegraphed Chapin to return home "for consultations" and informed Hungary that the United States resolutely rejects the demand to execute Chapin. This mutual notification is the most serious of tensions between the United States and Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe. The only worse step besides war would be breaking off diplomatic relations with Hungary. It is reported that the United States is currently considering: (1) condemning Hungary's actions in the Mindszenty case in the United Nations and condemning its violation of treaties; (2) protesting Hungary's trial and sentencing of Mindszenty and the charges against Chapin; (3) demanding that Hungary close its consulates in New York and Cleveland.

### US Considers a Far East Strategic Defense Line

Most Officials Advocate Abandoning Japan

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] According to various indications here, the island defense line off the coast of Asia seems to occupy an important position in the US military plan. Although the military analysts interviewed by the United Press have many differences on the details, the main points of the various opinions are: in the long term, the gains of the Communists in China will cause the United States to consider where to establish a strategic defense line. Almost no one believes that the military force of the Communists from Asia will become any serious offensive threat in the next few years, but in order to account for possible future events and prepare for the necessity of dealing with such events, the "island defense line" is particularly important. Some people say that this defense line should include Japan under occupation from the far north to the American bases in the Philippines in the south. However, according to news from Tokyo, some people advocate abandoning Japan in the island defense line. Observers here believe that the Army Department's denial of the authenticity of the Tokyo news shows that senior officials have different opinions on the strategic value of Japan. If this is the case, the above denial may indicate that the majority opinion of policymakers in Washington is prepared to abandon Japan and believe that Japan does not occupy an important position in the US strategy.
