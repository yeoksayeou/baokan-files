[Central News Agency, Xiamen, 7th] The navy's "Yongding" and "Yongxiu" ships, which participated in the Yangtze River Defense War, broke through under Communist fire after Nanjing, Jiangyin, and other places fell and have now arrived in Xiamen. According to "Yongding" Captain Liu Dekai and "Yongxiu" Captain Gui Zongyan, the two ships were originally ordered to defend the Yangtze River and protect key areas along the river such as Anqing and Wuhu, inflicting heavy blows on the Communist army. When the Communist army crossed the river, they were ordered to retreat. At that time, there were more than ten warships along the river, but they were distributed in various sections and not concentrated. The "Yongding" ship departed from Anqing on April 22, leading the ships eastward.

Their heroic spirit can be called a glorious page in the history of the Chinese Navy. Because Shanghai was close to the war zone and the ship's body needed to be repaired, they sailed to Xiamen for repair and reorganization.

### American Newspaper Warns the Philippines, Prevent the Infiltration of the Fifth Column

[Central News Agency, Manila, 6th Special Dispatch] The Manila Bulletin, run by American businessmen, recently warned the Philippines to be wary of Soviet forces, disguised as the Chinese Communist Party, which would be extremely dangerous for the Philippines. The newspaper commented on Chennault's statement that if the Communist Party conquers China, it will eventually cause the entire loss of Asia, saying that any country that adheres to democracy should not ignore the situation in China, especially the Philippines. The Philippines cannot act like an ostrich and bury its head in the sand. If there is indeed a Soviet conspiracy and force in China, then the Philippines must be vigilant. The Soviet plan will not stop in China but will extend to other Eastern countries, but what it adopts is not force but the fifth column of infiltration.

### Hu Shi Talks to American Reporters, The National Army Can Still Hope to Win, The Fate of All of Asia Rests on China

[United Press, New York, 7th] Dr. Hu Shi met with a United Press reporter at his residence here today and analyzed the situation in China. The reporter asked what he thought of Chennault's statement that one million dollars a day could save China. Hu replied: I am not a military expert and am not qualified to judge this estimate. Material assistance is certainly needed. He also said: "In my view, the position of our country today is not worse than that of France and Belgium when they were invaded by the German army during the last World War. Both countries were trampled by the enemy and were in a precarious situation, but the people did not lose courage because they believed that the Allies could support them and that the Germans would eventually be driven out. I believe that the National Government's position has not been lost, and we can still win." The reporter asked Hu whether he believed that the Chinese Communist Party was directly colluding with Moscow. Hu replied: "Of course!" and showed a copy of the Chinese Communist Party's program, proving that the Chinese Communist Party's line is consistent with Moscow. Hu concluded: "The fate of all of Asia rests on the Chinese Civil War. If China is occupied, the rest of East Asia will fall under Soviet control."

### US Senate Appropriations Subcommittee Starts Investigating China Policy, Bullitt Suggests Sending Wedemeyer and Chennault to China

[United Press, Washington, 6th] The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee began preparations on the 6th to formally investigate US policy toward China.

Republican Senator Bridges said that the committee had intelligence that the White House had prevented the Army from proposing to transport captured German weapons and ammunition to the Chinese National Government after the European war.

The investigation of China policy was prepared by Bridges and Subcommittee Chairman McClellan, with Secretary of State Acheson sitting in front of them on the witness stand. Bridges and McClellan asked several questions, asking Acheson to answer them at a later date.

Bridges asked Assistant Secretary of State Butterworth to provide the names of the personnel who served in the State Department's Far East Division since 1930 and the personnel who handled relations with Germany since 1943. He specifically pointed out Su Weisi and Davis, requesting to know their past records.

McClellan requested to obtain the records of Butterwass, director of the State Department's Far East Division, and his predecessor, Vincent (currently the US ambassador to Switzerland).

Bridges told reporters that he requested the Appropriations Subcommittee to investigate China policy because everyone else was avoiding it. He had to invite officials in the State Department who were familiar with the development of China policy to express their views, and then invite Acheson to ask how he would act in the future. He also wanted to know the truth about the dismantling of German factory machinery and would try to obtain records of whether the investigating officials were loyal to the country, but did not expect the government to publish these records.

McClellan asked whether the State Department's proposal to allocate funds to establish an embassy in South Korea was a mistake, because "if the Communist Party occupies China, it will soon annex Japan and South Korea."

Butterworth replied that although the currency had inflated slightly, the country had not been occupied by the Communist Party, "I believe that if the American flag flies at the embassy, it will help encourage resistance."

Bridges asked Acheson to provide a list of State Department officials who handled Chinese and German affairs since 1930, "so we can know who is responsible for the tragedy in China and the foolish behavior in Germany."

Regarding the Army Department's proposal to transport German weapons to China, Acheson said he did not know the details. Bridges then asked Acheson to investigate and then explain whether a White House assistant official named Locke withdrew the order to transport weapons to China when some German weapons were already on their way to China. Acheson agreed to provide information to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee.

Bridges also told Butterworth that he would ask questions later about the State Department's "removal of personnel whose loyalty to the country is questionable." The "most cunning" members of the Communist Party will never join organizations that are listed as destructive.

Butterworth said that as far as he knew, there were no Communist Party members in the State Department, but "the people who worry me, you and I do not know." He was "quite pleased" with the current situation and believed that there was no need for the State Department or Congress to worry.

[United Press, Washington, 7th] Republican Congressman Jackson demanded a quick vote on a bill to investigate American Far East policy on the 6th. The case was proposed by Jackson and Senator Nolan. According to Jackson, the Rules Committee is paying close attention to it, but it must first be passed by the Rules Committee before it can be submitted to the House for discussion. The case advocates that a committee composed of five members each from the Senate and the House conduct a detailed investigation of American Far East policy and authorize the committee to decide where to meet and draft recommendations for future American policy. However, it has not been decided whether the committee can meet in the Far East.

[United Press, Washington, 6th] Former Ambassador Bullitt urged President Truman on the 6th to send Generals Wedemeyer and Chennault to China to help organize the National Government to resist the Communist Party. However, Bullitt believes that unless pressure is applied to the government with sentiment, there is little hope that the United States will act in time.

Bullitt met with United Press reporters and advocated using American silver to strengthen the National Government's economy and military funds. Bullitt strongly advocated that action should be taken quickly, saying, "President Truman should immediately send a first-class combat general, preferably Wedemeyer, to China to provide advice on strategy, tactics, logistics, service, training, and all other aspects of resistance. At the same time, we should hand over all the large number of surplus aircraft we have in Japan and Okinawa to Chennault to form an effective air force."

[United Press, Washington, 7th] Siers, an employee of Newmont Mining Company, accused the United States on the 7th of "steadily sucking away" China's silver, leading to the progress of communism in China. Siers stated in the Senate Subcommittee that he supported the bill that would allow newly mined and refined gold to be traded freely in the United States. He said, "Much of the despair and misfortune in China occurred because we took away the silver they considered to be money. No wonder they became Communists."

The British government should make a practical declaration to defend Hong Kong at any cost. There are now vague assurances that Britain intends to maintain its position, but this is not enough.

[Reuters, Canberra, 8th] When asked on the 7th how Australia would assist Britain in handling the situation in Hong Kong, Australian Minister of Defense Taitman replied that Australia would first observe the development of the situation in Hong Kong and then issue a statement or take action related to the area.

### Weekly Forum: The Dead End and Hope of the Economy

— Ma Daying

The banknote shortage is attacking every city, and the crazy rise of silver dollars is causing all commerce to stop; the economy is striding towards a dead end. Everyone's survival is under serious threat. Is this the beginning of a total social collapse? Or is it the arrival of the end of the world?

Such a precarious economic crisis is worse than political and military changes. If there is no way to deal with it, everything will be over. However, the problem is very simple: a loss of confidence in the Gold Yuan coupon and a lack of trust in any government policy. However, this is not the biggest and real crisis. The real crisis lies in the ruling class's lack of courage to face and admit the facts, lack of wisdom to change course, and especially hateful is their clinging to real interests and unwillingness to let go, having the air of "I would rather ruin the world than harm a hair of mine." Only then have we had today's difficulties, creating today's intractable stalemate.

Today, there are solutions, but the most difficult thing is that the financial authorities are creating all kinds of excuses, unwilling for the country to have a solution. This is by no means slander. The common people cannot be deceived, and since we reformed the currency system last August, there have been financial or economic reform plans of various kinds, but they have always been focused on deceiving the people with paper money. They have never been willing to have real reforms. The common people have seen enough and don't want to see anymore. The value of the Gold Yuan coupon has repeatedly declined, and no one really wants it anymore. Therefore, no matter how fast the printing press turns and how much the banknotes increase, their overall total value drops sharply. This is the inevitable result of "governing the world by deception." Is this really irreparable?

For the benefit of a few wealthy families and a certain faction, the national economy is not worth considering, and the people's livelihood is not worth caring about. This is the real problem, and the real reason why China has become what it is today. Issuing banknotes is a weapon for wealthy families to suck blood, and the national economy is heading for a dead end. Why should they feel sorry for it?

After inflation, there is no effective way other than using hard currency. In fact, today's China is already a silver coin world, and prices expressed in silver coins are quite stable. However, we do not recognize this fact, nor are we willing to seek reform on this ready-made basis. The gold and silver thrown out falls into the hands of wealthy families and their factions, or into the hands of "scalpers."

The Gold Yuan coupon should be abandoned. Today, it should be announced that silver coins will be used. For two years, the author has always advocated the use of silver coins. Today, it is even more proven that there is no other feasible way. However, people always have several fears, which the author believes are unnecessary.

First, people will certainly ask what to do with the finances: I think it's very simple. Each soldier receives a salary of six yuan per month. If it is actually paid according to the number of people, a little over ten million yuan is enough. Civil and military officials retain a base of ten yuan, and those above ten yuan receive one-tenth, which is much less than before the war, but much better than the current situation. There will be no complaints, and it will only be twenty or thirty million yuan. Adding office expenses, then fifty or sixty million yuan per month is enough to cope. This amount of money should be available today. Taxes should be collected in silver dollars, and more than twenty million should be received, and the amount received will gradually increase. After the tax revenue increases, everything will be adjusted from scratch.

Second, people will certainly ask, what if there are not enough silver coins? This shortage has two sides. One side is the financial shortage. How long can the national silver reserves be used to make up for the financial deficit? The other side is the economic shortage. Are there enough social chips at the bottom? In the former case, there should be no problem for six months. If gold in storage is exchanged for silver, or gold coins weighing one tael are minted, each worth 100 silver dollars, there should be no problem for the financial deficit within two years. Regarding the latter, there is still a considerable amount of auxiliary coin coupons in the hands of the people. If a considerable amount of silver dollar coupons are issued with a 60% reserve, it can barely be used. At the same time, negotiate a silver loan with the United States, which will be repaid with agricultural and mineral products in the future, and more silver coins will be minted. There are enough chips. Moreover, after the currency value is stabilized, idle cash will enter the bank, the use of credit currency will increase, and the use of hard currency will decrease. There will not be too much shortage of chips.

Third, some people are even more worried about the problem of silver being smuggled out. This is even less of a concern. There are comings and goings in the economy. Today, goods are exchanged for silver dollars, and tomorrow, silver dollars are exchanged for goods. The comings and goings are roughly equal. What is there to be afraid of?

The author believes that today's problem can only be solved by using silver coins to create a line of hope in the economy. After the people's hearts are settled, economic development and prosperity can be realized. Gold and silver must circulate in the hands of the people, gold and silver must fulfill their true responsibility of "currency," and the people must not only be able to survive, but also live well. Real wealth must increase, and the consumption of the people and the country must increase. The government will naturally become a strong government supported by the whole country, and all problems will be easily solved.

Today's economic crisis is caused by the fear of paper money. Only by releasing hard currency can it be saved! It's time to let go.

### Constituent Assembly Approves Draft Constitution, West Germany Sets Up Prototype Government, Establishing a Foundation for a Unified German Government

[Reuters, Bonn, West Germany, 6th] German politicians today established a prototype government in West Germany. The West German Constituent Assembly today decided to establish an interim committee to carry out government tasks before the establishment of the Federal Government. The proposer of the motion, Free Democratic Party leader Schäfer, said that the purpose of the transitional committee is to collect and study data to prepare for unified legislation, and to draft laws for the establishment of various government departments, so that the Federal Government can start work immediately after its establishment.

[Associated Press, Bonn, Germany, 6th] The Constituent Assembly today passed the West German Government Charter on second reading, with only two Communist Party members voting against it. The draft constitution will be read for the third time tomorrow, with two particularly interesting provisions: (1) requesting that West Berlin be incorporated into West Germany, a proposal that had previously been opposed by the American, British, and French military governors; (3) stipulating the abolition of the death penalty for West German criminals, which is the only provision supported by the Communist Party. In addition, the location of the West German capital will be decided at the meeting on the 8th, and the establishment of the West German Republic is tentatively scheduled for July 15th.

[United Press International, Bonn, 6th] The German Constituent Assembly today elected an 18-member executive committee to serve as a temporary government. This West German government will administer under the supervision of the Allies. The formal government will be formally established after a general election held in late July. The Allies are prepared to transfer the occupied areas of Germany to civilian control and will intervene as little as possible in German administration. The West German interim government is elected from the parliamentarians, with a total of seven members, including one from the Socialist Party, one from the Christian Democratic Party, two from the Free Democratic Party, and one from each of the other parties. According to sources in Berlin, the Western Allied military leaders have empowered the West German government, and once the government is formally established, it will be able to establish a federal police force. West German leaders hastily established a constitution and decided to establish a government when the four powers agreed to lift the Berlin blockade and hold a four-power foreign ministers' meeting, because the Germans hope that if the Western Allies and the Soviet Union reach an agreement, the unified German government may be based on the Bonn Constitution.

### Starting at Midnight on the 11th of This Month, Traffic Between East and West Germany Will Resume, British Foreign Secretary Arrives in Berlin to Inspect Airlift

[Reported by Our Newspaper] London, 7th, Broadcast: Berlin Dispatch, British Foreign Secretary Bevin arrived here today by special plane from London to inspect the Berlin airlift and hold talks with Allied and German leaders. Mr. Bevin had an informal conversation with British and American pilots at the airport, saying: "The hope for peace has never been as good as it is today, but we have not yet escaped danger. We must continue to work hard until peace is guaranteed."

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Authoritative sources in the Department of Defense tacitly acknowledge that the order to suspend the airlift to relieve Berlin will be issued at the four-power foreign ministers' meeting on May 30th. Therefore, personnel and aircraft participating in the airlift will remain in place until an order is received.

[United Press International, Berlin, 6th] General Clay, the US military governor in Germany, told reporters on the 6th that Allied transport vehicles will begin to move towards Berlin starting at midnight on the 11th. Mr. Clay said that he had not received any notification from the Soviet side regarding the lifting of the blockade, which will take effect on the 12th, and that no negotiations had been conducted with the Soviet Union in Berlin on the details of resuming traffic. "I do not believe any negotiations are necessary."

### Large Quantities of Goods Receive Favorable Treatment, Berlin Becomes Active Again

[Agence France-Presse, Frankfurt, 6th] The authorities of the German double occupation zone have taken all necessary measures to restore traffic to Berlin, but the military government has not yet issued a formal directive. A large quantity of fresh food is currently being stored to be transported to Berlin. The quantity transported will depend on the number of trains that the Soviet military authorities allocate to the double occupation zone authorities. Soon after the anti-blockade is lifted, purchasing delegations from the Soviet side will arrive here. The trade agreement between the double occupation zone and the Soviet military zone will also be re-implemented, but some adjustments will be made due to the different currency systems.

[Reuters, Berlin, 7th] Although the four powers have announced that the Berlin blockade will be formally lifted on the 12th, the city of Berlin, which has been isolated from the East and West for more than ten months, has begun to become active again today. After the East Berlin police announced yesterday that they would allow West Berlin residents to go to East Berlin shops to buy food, West Berlin housewives flocked to East Berlin today, willing to pay high prices to buy. It is also reported that officials from East and West Germany are drafting a list of trade goods to ensure that trade between the East and West will return to normal even after the trade blockade is lifted.

### Spanish Question, US Refutes Soviet and Polish Accusations

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 6th] US representative Austin today denied Poland's accusations of the US colluding with Spain in the UN Political Committee. It is claimed that the US has not established a military alliance with Spain and has not granted Spain air force bases. The US has never initiated efforts to bring Spain into the United Nations, the Marshall Plan, or the Atlantic Pact. Spain's participation in such cooperative programs cannot be decided solely by the US.

### Czechoslovakia Applies to Participate in the Marshall Plan, Doubts Expressed by Harriman

### British Commonwealth Countries Decide to Assist Burma, Communiqué to Be Issued in Two Days

[United Press International, London, 6th] According to official sources, the 6th stated: British Commonwealth countries will announce a plan to provide material assistance to Burma within 48 hours. Indian Prime Minister Nehru has stated that unless Tekin Nu and the Karen people reach an agreement, the Burmese unrest will intensify. At the same time, it is reported that another Asian conference will be convened in New Delhi to take similar measures on the Indonesian and Vietnamese issues. Well-informed sources claim that British Commonwealth politicians agree that restoring law and order in Southeast Asia is a prerequisite for the actions of the Southern Asian Group to prevent communist expansion. Another report: In addition to the New Delhi conference, the Federal Prime Ministers' Conference will be held in Colombo at the end of this year. It is also reported that Burmese Prime Minister Tekin Nu will visit the United States in October and will also visit the Philippines, Japan, and other Southeast Asian countries.

### Fierce Fighting in the Burmese-Thai Border Area

[Associated Press, Rangoon, 7th] Burmese government troops and Karen troops fought fiercely today along a 15-mile-long front, vying for the railway strongholds of Nangalpin and Thaigon. The government claims that the Karen troops hope to use the two towns as a springboard to massively reinforce the Karen troops in the Insein area, ten miles north of Rangoon. Karen troops are piling up corpses along the Rangoon-Mandalay railway line.

[Reuters, Rangoon, 6th] Tonight's government communiqué stated that as a result of the overnight fierce fighting in the Thaigon area, seventy miles north of Rangoon, government troops killed 140 insurgents. Insurgents in the Maubi area, thirty miles northwest of Rangoon, repeatedly attacked government troops at night and were repelled. Government troops and insurgents also had occasional contact in the Bassein and Myaungmya areas of the Irrawaddy Delta.

### Nehru Returns to India, Plans to Visit the US in October

### Five Pacific Nations to Hold Meteorological Conference, to Be Held in Manila on the 10th

### Jessup to Fly to Paris Tomorrow to Prepare for Four Foreign Ministers' Meeting, Soviet Union to Make Three Concessions on the German Issue

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 7th] American sources here said today that US representative Jessup, who presided over the US-Soviet talks, will fly to Paris from Washington on the 9th to prepare for the four foreign ministers' meeting to be held here on May 23rd.

[Reuters, Berlin, 6th] German newspapers registered with the US zone authorities reported that three concessions would be made: (1) establishing a federal republic, with the Soviet Union not specifically stipulating the date of establishment; (2) the Soviet Union will, under any circumstances, try to unify the German currency system so that the Soviet zone economy can be revived; (3) even if the four-power talks fail, the Soviet Union is still prepared to completely withdraw from East Germany. The newspaper also said that Soviet military government officials only regard the lifting of the blockade as a technical matter for the transportation department. The Soviet Union has begun preparing materials for the Paris four-power conference so that the Soviet Union can regain the initiative and promote its plan for German unification and a fair peace in Paris.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 6th] Diplomatic circles here predicted on the eve of the four foreign ministers' meeting that the result of the foreign ministers' meeting, if it can establish a unified democratic German federation, which is subject to strict Allied control until a peace treaty is signed, and stipulates the date for signing the peace treaty, would be the "greatest success." If the result of the meeting is only to agree to establish two different but cooperative political systems in Germany, it would only be a "half success." They are not overly optimistic about the four foreign ministers holding a meeting, but they are quite satisfied because they believe that this meeting can allow the four countries to have contact and help improve the situation. French officials said about the duration of the meeting, "All countries have agreed in principle to end around June 15th so that the discussion will not be delayed for too long."

### Britain, America, and the Soviet Union Launch a Broadcasting War, Propaganda Between East and West Will Become More Intense

[Reuters, London, 6th] It is revealed here that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will increase foreign language broadcasting programs starting this summer, intensifying the propaganda war between East and West. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Voice of America are working together to overwhelm some powerful radio stations that are disrupting British and American broadcasts. According to the BBC, the scale of these disruptions is no less than that launched by Nazi radio stations during the war. At the same time, Moscow Radio will also increase English broadcasting programs to Britain and America. English broadcasting to Britain will increase from 16.5 hours per week to 19 hours, and broadcasting to America will increase from 14 hours per week to 20 hours. To deal with the interference of powerful radio stations, the BBC will increase two 30-minute broadcasts each time, using 25 radio transmitters simultaneously each time.

### President Syngman Rhee Asks the US Government to Clarify Its Attitude Towards South Korea, If North Korea Invades, Will the US Be Able to Defend South Korea?

[United Press International, Seoul, 7th] President Syngman Rhee publicly asked the United States on the 7th to announce whether it would defend the Republic of South Korea if Soviet-sponsored North Korea launched an invasion. Mr. Rhee's statement said: South Koreans want to understand whether South Korea is the front line of US defense in the Far East. In fact, the question of whether US troops will remain stationed in Korea is far more important than the above question. It is reported that the 8,000 US troops stationed here will be withdrawn this summer.

### Two Battalions of South Korean Rebels Have Entered North Korea

[Reuters, London, 6th] Moscow Radio claimed today that, according to reports from the North Korean Intelligence Bureau, two battalions of the South Korean army have entered North Korea after defecting.

The eighth question was, "What attitude will the people of the People's Republic of Macedonia (one of the Yugoslav federations) take in the face of any external attacks that attempt to separate this republic from other states?" Tito replied: "The people of the Republic of Macedonia never intend to separate from other republics of Yugoslavia, because they have obtained everything they need within the Yugoslav Federal Republic, that is, absolute equality of rights and equal opportunities for development." The ninth question was, "Does Tito welcome Stalin's recent statement that he is willing to reach a reconciliation with the United States?" Tito said: "Our most sincere hope is that the United States and the Soviet Union can reach a peaceful agreement to resolve all disputes." Smith is the person who recently asked Stalin for his opinion on the Dushi talks. It is also reported that Smith's questions to Tito, the first six of which were all about the recently formed "Free Greek Democratic Government," were not answered by Tito. The six questions were as follows: (1) "What attitude does the Yugoslav government take towards this government?" (2) "What do you think of the participation of non-Greek elements in this government?" (3) "In your opinion, who took the initiative to organize this government?" (4) "Do you believe that the organization of this new government is intended to interfere in the internal affairs of countries other than Greece?" (5) "Do you believe that this government can benefit the Greek people?" (6) "Do you believe that this government is willing to seek the peace and security of the Balkans?"

### The British Labour Party

— By Brailsford, Translated by Song Guihuang

The central aim of the Labour Party is to eliminate the inequality of status and opportunity – that is, the inequality of class, gender, and color – that hinders the development of human potential and suppresses self-esteem. In positive terms, this means that the Labour Party's vision lies in building an ideal society in which we can all embrace a common goal, working together to achieve it and taking it as a guide in all daily life. This ideal cannot be realized as long as a particular class can use private ownership of land and machines as its economic power to manipulate, exploit, and extract wealth from ordinary people.

In practice, the Labour Party has two methods of realizing this classless society. The first is the ordinary effort of modern wealthy countries to ensure that everyone can enjoy an appropriate minimum standard of living, that everyone's wages can sustain life, that everyone has housing, that everyone can enjoy the beauty of art and nature, that everyone has health security, is not unemployed, and has pensions. In particular, the children of the poor should have equal opportunities to receive a reasonable education as the children of the few rich. To achieve this, it is necessary to impose harsh taxes so that everyone's income can be close to equal. Pressure must be gradually applied from the bottom, and non-privileged classes must organize. However, in my personal opinion, the realization of this matter must rely on our political opponents having a sense of fairness and justice to accept our appeal. Everyone knows that, in fact, in the past fifty years, the reactions of the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party to the Labour Party's pressure have sometimes been joyful and sometimes been resentful. This is how democracy works.

The second problem the Labour Party encounters is the basic issue of power. This heroic effort to enable everyone to enjoy a higher minimum standard of living cannot be achieved by simply collecting taxes and distributing welfare. "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" is only one half of the socialist ideal. The other half is "From each according to his ability, to each according to his contribution." In other words, we must use psychology to assist in planning production enterprises so that the whole people can produce the highest output, whether they are manual workers or managers and technicians, they must work together. However, in industry, factory owners often limit production, raise prices, and use the unemployment of a part of the people as a means to threaten workers in order to make more profit. If the final say is still in the hands of these factory owners, can the plan for mass production still be realized? It is possible to control it by using external force, but this method often makes people unwilling and not very effective. The socialist means is to make the means of production owned by the workers, so that the promotion of industry is for the public welfare, not for private profit. If we proceed according to this method, then can we enable the entire people to work together to realize social coordination, self-esteem, the honor of joint production, and higher output? The Labour Party's policy is most suitable for major industries and monopolistic industries. However, it does not take nationalization as its goal. Nationalization is just a means, and the purpose of which is democracy in daily life and the equal sharing of wealth – spiritual and material – produced by the common labor of the whole people. Specifically, can we realize this classless society in the Purton Farm and the South Wales coal mines?

Finally, socialism is an international creed, aimed at the welfare of all mankind. Socialists want to serve all mankind with this doctrine, whether they are natives on the African colonies or their compatriots, they are treated equally, regardless of territorial boundaries. We are happy to support the independence of India. We will also use this doctrine as a principle to formulate a suitable program for a world government, in order to rely on it to realize world peace and prevent the recurrence of world wars. (The End)

### Participating Committee Resolves Six Items: Abolish Public Utility Index and Formulate New Calculation Method, Large Industrial Users Pay 30% First, Others Temporarily Pay According to the Last Salary Index

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Public Utility Committee of the City Council held a general meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday in the Great Hall of the Council to discuss how to suppress the unreasonable surge in the prices of public utilities in the city. Deputy Speaker Xu Jilu, Councilors Zhu Fuju, Zhang Zhongyuan, Jiang Haoran, Li Wenjie, Xu Yongzuo, Qu Qian, Ma Junshuo, Tong Xiang, He Yuanming, and over fifty others attended. Acting Director Gu Zhenbai of the Public Utility Bureau and over ten persons in charge of various public utility companies were present as observers. The meeting was chaired by Jiang Hao, convener of the Public Utility Group. First, Acting Director Gu explained the method of compiling the pricing index for public utilities, stating briefly: In the past, public utilities in the city used the employee living index for billing due to the excessive devaluation of currency. The difference between revenue and expenditure was too large to maintain. Therefore, a method of calculating fees based on the original base number according to the price index was re-drafted. The Public Utility Committee of the City Council resolved on April 23 to conduct a one-month trial at its discretion. The above-mentioned pricing index originally used the wholesale price index compiled by the Central Bank of this city as the standard. Unexpectedly, the Central Bank stopped compiling the price index shortly after the trial, thus losing its basis. Therefore, it was necessary to select the main factors related to the cost of public utilities: (1) Zhongbai Japonica rice, (2) Exchange settlement certificate, (3) Zhongxie oil, (4) Keelung coal, and calculate the ratio of the above four factors to the Central Bank's price index based on the daily price records of the Joint Credit Investigation Agency and the prices announced by the competent authorities to estimate the price index.

Opinions Are Voiced Vigorously from All Walks of Life

Then, the councilors spoke separately on behalf of various institutions such as the Industry Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and hospitals. They unanimously believed that public utilities are closely related to the general public of the city and should undoubtedly serve the citizens. However, at a time when all industries are declining and the market is extremely depressed, the public utility companies in this city intend to benefit themselves alone, arbitrarily formulate a pricing index, adopt the four highest prices of rice, coal, diesel, and foreign exchange transfer certificates as counting factors to seek huge profits. The Municipal Public Utility Bureau not only fails to fulfill its supervisory responsibilities but also helps the companies speak everywhere, which makes all walks of life feel extremely emotional. Those who spoke yesterday were very emotional, and they spared no effort to attack the companies and the Public Utility Bureau authorities. Councilor Li Wenjie said: The prices of public utilities are soaring endlessly. In fact, all industries are unable to bear them. This council accepted this method with extremely heavy emotions on April 23, with the aim of maintaining public utilities. At that time, there were two reservations: (1) A trial period of one month or half a month. (2) The base number should be reduced as much as possible. Later, the Central Bank stopped compiling the price index, and another pricing index was adopted, which led to serious errors and should be resisted immediately, using the salary index as the basis for calculation. Yan E said: The salary index is the standard for salary payment and is also one of the costs. It is recommended that 40% of the public utility pricing index should be based on the cost of living index, and 60% should be based on the price index. Wang Zijian said: (1) There is a problem with the base number for public utility pricing. For example, the base number for electricity prices is based on the standard of March 1, while other prices are based on the August 19 price as the base, with a difference of half a month, causing a disconnect. (2) The Central Bank provides huge loans (US$600,000) to the companies every month to compensate. Since the term is rolled over every half month, users have the right to request payment according to the old price of half a month ago. Fan Shouyuan said: I represent the public and private hospitals in this city and appeal and give examples: (1) The electricity bill for Zhongshan Hospital this month is as high as over 3 billion yuan, which exceeds the hospital's total income. (2) Tongji Hospital is small, with only 50 beds, and the total gas bill for this month is over 1 billion yuan. The hospital's total monthly income is only enough to pay for half a month of gas. In this case, unless the authorities order all citizens not to get sick, the hospital will have no way to continue to operate.

Six Resolutions

The meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM and resolved the following six points: (1) The types of goods listed in the calculation method of the price index adopted by the Public Utility Bureau are excessive and should be stopped, and other types of goods should be stipulated and a calculation method should be formulated. (2) Please ask the municipal government to immediately organize a review committee to discuss the base number and collection index. (3) Before the new calculation method is formulated, all users who have not paid, large industrial users should pay 30% first before the 14th of this month, and other users should pay according to the salary index of employees in the last period first. After the new method is formulated, the settlement will be made, adopting the method of refunding more and compensating less. (4) Please ask the government to reduce the prices of fuel required for public utilities as much as possible, and please ask the Central Bank to relax the loan surprise for public utilities, especially for public utility loans and the handling of coal materials, which should not be for the purpose of seeking profits. (5) Please ask the Central Bank to grant water and electricity loans for industrial and commercial enterprises to avoid the shutdown of industrial and commercial enterprises due to their inability to pay water and electricity bills. (6) The Public Utility Review Committee will be represented by this council appointing Jiang Hao, Jiang Haoran, Li Wenjie, Zhu Fuju, Fei Shusheng, and Qu Qian. For other units and numbers of people, please ask the municipal government to determine the appointment.

### Communists Send a Large Number of Spies to Specialize in Purchasing Silver Dollars and Gold, Stores Only Accept and Do Not Release, Strict Investigation Will Be Conducted

### Method for Calculating Employee Salaries Can Be Announced Tomorrow, Those with a Base Salary of 50 Yuan Will Have 10 Silver Dollars Converted

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau has recently drafted a "Shanghai Employee Salary Calculation Method During Extraordinary Times." This method must be passed by the Police Department's Political Affairs Committee before it can be announced tomorrow. The contents of the original draft method are as follows:

It has been found that employee salaries in this city have been based on the employee cost of living index. To this day, it is clear that it can no longer adapt to reality. In order to stabilize the lives of employees and take into account the needs of both labor and capital, the following employee salary calculation methods are specifically stipulated:

1.  The method of calculating salaries based on the employee cost of living index is abolished. Starting in May, employee salaries will be calculated according to the base salary standard after August 19. The grades are as follows: (1) 20% for those below 50 yuan (those with a base salary of 50 yuan will have 10 silver dollars converted). (2) 10% for those between 51 yuan and 100 yuan (those with a base salary of 100 yuan will have 15 silver dollars converted). (3) 5% for those above 101 yuan (those with a base salary of 200 yuan will have 20 silver dollars converted).

2.  The government will hold special employee coordination rice, specially prepared for various manufacturers to purchase at a price (or purchased by the manufacturers themselves), according to the number of employees, based on issuing one dou of rice to each employee (the current key ration rice remains the same), which will be deducted from the employee's wages.

3.  The employee's wages, except for the special ration that should be deducted, the excess part will be converted into banknotes or other goods or directly issued in silver dollars by the employer according to the price of silver dollars on that day.

4.  The date of salary payment will still be handled according to the habits of each factory. All advance payment methods will be cancelled.

According to Director Cao of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, this method is only to stabilize the salaries and wages of employees. All kinds of allowances, bonuses, rice subsidies, etc. that originally existed in various factories and stores still exist, and cannot be cancelled under the pretext. They must also be calculated in silver dollars according to the above method.

### Female Bank Clerk Dies from Taking Sleeping Pills, Yang Yayan's Life is Pitiful, Complex Inside Story Awaits Investigation

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yang Yayan, a female clerk in the audit department of the Siming Bank's head office, took a large number of sleeping pills on the 3rd of this month and committed suicide at No. 301 Kang Sui Apartment, Lin Sen Middle Road. She was discovered and sent to Guangci Hospital for emergency treatment, but she eventually died, and the incense and jade disappeared at 8:00 PM on the 6th.

Yang was from Cixi, Zhejiang, and was 26 years old. During the Anti-Japanese War, she married Chen Xinian from Zhenhai in Chongqing. The relationship was harmonious after the marriage, and they had two sons. After the victory, Yang immediately went to Shanghai with her husband, who then flew to Chongqing again to settle his business in Chongqing. In the spring of 1946, he took a plane back to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the plane crashed midway, and the passengers were killed, including Chen.

Yang was usually cheerful and lively, and everyone who knew her loved her innocence and pitied her situation. Since joining Siming, she has reached three years, and her serious and capable work has also been admired by her colleagues in the bank. The colleagues in the bank were all saddened by the sudden change. It is said that Yang's death has a very tortuous inside story. Last year, Yang met Lou Qijun, the former manager of the Shanghai branch of the Zhejiang Provincial Bank. The Kang Sui Apartment where Yang took poison was Lou's residence. After the incident, the police bureau immediately summoned Lou. Lou reportedly said that the house owed Yang four large bars of gold, which could not be repaid, and had been sold to Yang as collateral. However, most people think that the matter is not that simple. The details are being personally investigated by Zhang Yuzhong, the chief of the Lujiawan District Police Bureau.

Regarding the "Rice hidden in mailbags for smuggling" incident that occurred at the North Station, as reported by a certain newspaper in the city yesterday, relevant sources stated that the post office hires temporary laborers to load and unload mail along the route due to a shortage of manpower.

Two bags were sacks, three bags were hemp bags, one bag was a flour bag, and one bag was a travel bag, but they were not loaded in the mail car. Therefore, Guo Xinggang, the post office director on duty for the train, and his assistant, Lu Mutao, were unaware of the matter beforehand, proving that it was entirely the work of the laborers. The report involving Tao Fengzhu, the mail car escort for the post office, is a misunderstanding, as Tao is currently a receiving clerk in the dispatching section of the post office. The post office has begun a thorough investigation into the case to clarify the truth.

### Gold Shows Slight Firmness: National Bank's Selling Ultimately Suppressed Prices

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, gold trading was sparse, and the market trend was slightly firm.

Those absorbing at low prices were quite firm. The off-exchange opening price was 200 million, 230 million, once reaching 210 million, 240 million. In the middle of the session, the Central Bank resumed selling, entrusting Dadecheng Gold Firm to supply as much as possible at a price of 220 million. However, due to the extremely scarce appetite of large investors and a lack of inquiries, only three major bars were sold, and sentiment turned soft, retreating all the way to 160 million, 190 million.

### Rice Prices Rise: Oil Prices Decline Yesterday

### A Broad Discussion of the American Democratic Party (Part Two)

— Translated by Song Guihuang

(III) Jackson’s veto of the attempt to revise the charter of the "Federal Bank" demonstrated his political style. He said: "It is regrettable that the rich and powerful often force the government to act according to their selfish and self-interested purposes. When the laws make the rich richer and the powerful more powerful, the common people in society, such as farmers, artisans, and laborers, have neither the time nor the resources to make legislation beneficial to themselves, so they all have the right to come forward and appeal the injustices of their government."

The above words, coupled with Jackson's heroic personality and fearless leadership spirit, revived the democratic faith, something unseen since the era of Jefferson. The name "Democratic Party" was established during this period. Farmers, artisans, and laborers suddenly felt that they finally had a president who deeply cared about their interests. Writers and intellectuals, such as Hawthorne, Whitman, Cooper, Bryant, Bancroft, Irving, etc., all unanimously supported Jackson's principle of "equal rights for all, no privileges for anyone." In addition, Jackson's party also launched a new labor union movement.

On the other hand, most people in the industrial and commercial sectors held a hostile attitude towards Jackson, a depth of hostility unmatched towards any other president except for Franklin D. Roosevelt. The conservative Whig Party denounced Jackson as a creator of class antagonism and a dictator. Their leader, Clay, even cried on the Senate floor: "We are now trapped in a revolution. Past revolutions have been bloodless, but now it is rapidly changing the pure democratic nature of the government, and all power will be concentrated in the hands of one person."

Van Buren, who succeeded Jackson as president, attempted to carry out his democratic crusade, but at this time the issue of slavery began to dominate politics, almost excluding all other matters. In 1848, many Jacksonian members joined the Free Soil Party, thus securely placing Jackson's old party in the hands of slaveholders. Southern people abandoned Jefferson's legacy because of their insistence on the slavery system. Soon, the Southern faction openly denounced Jefferson's belief that "all men are created equal." The leader of the Southern faction, Calhoun, said: "Nothing could be more absurd."

As a politician from Illinois said, by 1859, the party that inherited the tradition from Jefferson no longer mentioned his name, while the new Republican Party, which originally inherited the tradition of opposition to Jefferson, stole his cloak and put it on themselves. Lincoln, in a unique way, listlessly put it wonderfully, saying something reminiscent of two drunk men fighting while wearing coats. After fighting for a long time, the two men's coats were accidentally swapped. "If the two major parties today are truly the two parties of Jefferson and Adams back then, then these two parties are the same as those two drunk men, eating and drinking from the same table."

The election of 1860 further divided the Democratic Party. Extreme pro-Southern elements entered the Charleston Party Convention in a rebellious manner. A Northern representative appealed to the attendees to maintain unity. A representative from Mississippi stood up and said: "We are fighting for principles. Damn the party." As a result, the nation split accordingly and embarked on a dark path of war.

From Jefferson to Buchanan, only two administrations were not Democratic. However, the Battle of Appomattox ushered in a period of decline for the Democratic Party. After this battle, anything related to patriotism and integrity was almost exclusively possessed by the Republican Party, while in the eyes of the people, the Democratic Party was a group formed by traitors and villains. They showed frustration, confusion, and corruption, and attempted to reorganize after the war, but they had neither a theoretical foundation nor leaders.

During Grant's administration, scandals spread everywhere, followed by the great turmoil of 1873, which severely hit the Republican Party, causing it to collapse beyond recovery. The Democratic Party seized the opportunity and publicly nominated the Governor of New York, Tilden, as their candidate. Tilden had previously reduced the Tweed Ring in New York City. Tilden was a conservative company legal advisor, known for his courage and loyalty, and thus had great influence in the constituency. The Republican candidate, Hayes, although intelligent and capable, was no match for him. However, the two sides were evenly matched. When the people voted, Tilden clearly won a majority, partly because many Southern black people (mostly Republicans) were disenfranchised. However, the situation changed during the later recount; and Hayes finally obtained a majority through an electoral college controlled by the Republican Party. As one student present said, the Democratic Party initially stole the election affairs, and then the Republican Party stole it back.

The Democratic Party accepted the decision of the Electoral College and reached a tacit agreement with the Republican Party. The agreement was: If Hayes was elected president, he would withdraw federal troops from the South. This meant that the Republican Party in the South would be eliminated, black people would be disenfranchised, and the South would become a safe territory for the Democratic Party. The result was the establishment of a consolidated South.

During these years, it was an era of political mediocrity, and the Democratic Party was no better than the Republican Party. The difficult times in the 1880s revealed major shortcomings in the economic system, and the grim slums in the western agricultural areas and various new cities exposed the great dissatisfaction of the people. The Democratic Party remained indifferent to the people's dissatisfaction, and only wanted to nominate candidates and platforms. In fact, there was no difference between the Democratic and Republican parties; they were just two sides of the same coin.

It was not until Cleveland emerged in 1886 that the Democratic Party had a leader. This person was straightforward, honest, and unpretentious. He successively served as the Mayor of Buffalo and the Governor of New York, and had made significant reforms and outstanding political achievements. Because of his integrity, he won the support of the neutral "Mugwump" Republicans and defeated Blaine in the election of 1884. Near the end of his first term, he ruled that the tax rate was too high. Politicians urged him to propose lowering the tax rate after the election, but Cleveland refused. He later wrote: "I do not want to seek re-election simply without letting the people understand my position on the tax rate issue as early as possible... From the party's standpoint, I may have made a mistake; but I don't care about that. I only know that this is the right thing to do. At least I am satisfied with this."

However, Cleveland was not much different from the patriotic Mugwump Republicans. Wilson once said: "You may think that Cleveland's government is Democratic. But it is not. Cleveland is a conservative Republican." His conservatism was clearly demonstrated in his second term. He ran for election in 1888 and failed partly because of the tax rate issue, but was re-elected in 1892. He undoubtedly showed more loyalty to capitalists because of four years of trying out corporate law. For example, his attorney general often avoided using the Sherman Antitrust Act to prevent trusts, but used this act in the 1894 railway strike to undermine labor interests.

However, the turbulent waves that had been ignored were surging dangerously. After thirty years of turbulence, the people in the West had become convinced that only by implementing inflation could all problems in this area be solved. Political activity increased as wheat prices fell, and the collapse of prices at the end of the 1890s united farmers into the "Farmers' Alliance." Terrible poverty crept across the prairies. One female speaker shouted to her neighbors: "What you farmers need to do is plant less grain and build more hells!"

### Postal Rate Adjustment Exceeds Pre-War Standards, Appeal for Reduction to Lighten People's Burden

To the Editor: Among the unreasonably high prices of various commodities at present, what has aroused public outrage besides public utilities is "postal rates." As the post office is a state-run enterprise and not a profit-making institution, each price increase should take into account the people's livelihood and must be approved by the Legislative Yuan to show solemnity. However, this price increase was not only without legal procedure; but the increase multiplier was higher than any previous record. Ordinary letters actually cost 160,000 yuan, express letters cost 800,000 yuan, and air express letters cost more than one million yuan! Is this not shocking! It is true that the Ministry of Communications has cancelled the subsidy policy and now the post office maintains itself, but the price increase should adopt reasonable standards so that reputations are well-regarded. However, this price increase is so high, regardless of the people's burden. How can society not be in an uproar?

### Urgent Appeal

It is best to do good and better to assist childbirth.

The number of poor pregnant women applying for the midwifery fund from our newspaper readers is increasing daily, but recent donations are very few, which will cause it to stop. We hereby make an urgent appeal to readers from all walks of life, hoping that you will generously donate to support this righteous cause. Your great expectation is highly appreciated!

Even with pre-war postal rates, ordinary letters were only four cents. Today, ordinary letters are 160,000 yuan. It is thought that the postal authorities must calculate silver dollars at 4 million yuan a piece. Four cents is exactly 160,000 yuan, which means restoring the pre-war standard, which seems very obvious. However, the value of silver dollars is more than twice the pre-war exchange rate with gold and about one times with rice. That is, before the war, 100 silver dollars could be exchanged for one tael of gold, while today it only takes more than 30 yuan; one stone of rice before the war cost 10 silver dollars, while today it is only worth about 5 yuan. It can be seen that the current value of silver dollars is an unreasonable artificial phenomenon. According to today, a letter is actually equivalent to more than eight cents before the war. I think that the people's living standards have been reduced many times due to years of war, while the postal burden is one to two times higher than the pre-war standard. Nothing is more unreasonable than this!

I am a loyal reader of your newspaper for more than 20 years. Knowing that your newspaper upholds justice, I specially write to you, respectfully requesting that it be published in the Readers' Letters column, and also asking you to jointly advocate a reduction in postal rates to lighten the people's burden. I am deeply grateful! I wish you all the best.

Sincerely,
Reader Leng Jingren

(Note: Since the postal rate was adjusted from 1,500 yuan for ordinary letters to 40,000 yuan, and then adjusted to 160,000 yuan, this column has received more than 30 letters from readers. Due to space constraints, we have only selected and published one letter from Mr. Leng, an old reader of our newspaper for more than 20 years, as a brief note. We deeply apologize to the remaining readers who submitted letters!)
