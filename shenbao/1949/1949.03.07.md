### The Beijing-Shanghai Control Issue to Become a Key Topic in Peace Talks; Yu Hanmou and Other Leaders from Southern China Scheduled to Fly to Beijing Today; Zhang Zhizhong Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Peace Negotiation Plan

[Our Newspaper] Executive Yuan Vice President Wu Tiecheng arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday and remained in Shanghai yesterday. He spent the entire day attending to important official matters and did not return to his residence until late at night. General Zhang Zhizhong, who is on a special mission to Xikou for negotiations, also stopped in Shanghai yesterday on his way back to Beijing. Wu and Zhang held important consultations here yesterday with key government officials to discuss the peace negotiation plan and strive to bridge the opinions of relevant parties. In the past, due to the lack of suitable individuals to mediate between various related parties, there were inevitable gaps in understanding the current situation. Furthermore, busybodies engaged in speculation, leading to numerous rumors that significantly impacted the overall situation. The current efforts of Wu and Zhang are aimed at serving as a bridge, ensuring that the peace plan is formulated with broad input and without omissions, and that all parties can agree on the plan once it is finalized. It is rumored that Vice President Wu may travel to eastern Zhejiang in the next few days to ensure the thorough implementation of his mission. [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] It is reported that the Chinese Communists may not insist on their original demands regarding the issue of war criminals, but those on the blacklist will not be allowed to participate in the future coalition government. The organization of the coalition government will still be based on the decisions made at the former Political Consultative Conference. Regarding the issue of jurisdiction over the Beijing-Shanghai area, it is likely to become one of the key topics of discussion during negotiations. The government hopes that the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai will remain under government control, while the Chinese Communists believe that Beijing and Shanghai are political, industrial, commercial, and cultural centers, and therefore should be controlled by the Chinese Communists to achieve the goal of controlling the entire country politically and financially. However, the lack of urban technical talent among the Chinese Communists will undoubtedly be a difficult challenge. [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Zhang Zhizhong and Wu Zhongxin, who went to eastern Zhejiang a few days ago, have not yet returned to Beijing as of the 6th. They are currently engaged in discussions in Shanghai and are expected to return to Beijing soon to report to Acting President Li and others. The Ten-Member Committee will reconvene within days to conduct a thorough discussion on the content of the peace negotiation plan. Zhang Qun visited Cheng Qian at the Capital Hotel at approximately 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th and departed after an hour of conversation. Yu Hanmou, Xue Yue, and Chen Jitang may fly to Beijing from Guangdong today at the invitation of Acting President Li.

### Nanjing Salvation Daily Penalized with Three-Day Suspension; Gong Debai Released After Severe Warning

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The Nanjing Salvation Daily almost suffered a major disaster due to two editorials. The newspaper was sealed by security agencies at midnight on the 5th, and the president, Gong Debai, was also summoned for questioning. However, by the evening of the 6th, it was decided to lift the seal, and the penalty was only a three-day suspension. Gong himself was released after receiving a "severe warning." The Salvation Daily is managed by Gong Debai, whose comments are known for their "artillery fire." For two consecutive days, the 4th and 5th, the newspaper published editorials titled "The People Demand Clarity in the Political Situation" and "China Cannot Be Saved Unless Chiang Kai-shek Leaves the Country," respectively. The content was intense, and the authorities were quite dissatisfied. At 11:00 PM on the evening of the 5th, the Capital Garrison Headquarters, in conjunction with the police and security authorities, sent personnel to seal the newspaper. They first went to Gong's residence to explain the authorities' reasons for summoning him. Gong immediately complied and went with them. Then, they went to the Salvation Daily to seal it. The execution was very polite, and the newspaper's colleagues were not offended in the slightest. Only the machine room, typesetting room, and other departments were sealed. The execution was completed at 3:00 AM on the morning of the 6th. At the time of the sealing, the newspaper's editorial department was working as usual, and then stopped. The newspaper was not published on the 6th. According to the editorial in the Salvation Daily on the 4th, "The People Demand Clarity in the Political Situation," the responsibility for creating today's serious situation rests with President Chiang, and that even after his retirement, he is still "manipulating politics and military affairs behind the scenes." The editorial on the 5th, "China Cannot Be Saved Unless Chiang Kai-shek Leaves the Country," stated that peace talks with the Communist Party were impossible unless President Chiang leaves the country. If the war continues, only President Chiang's departure can secure American aid. The two articles also touched on the failures of the Northeast and Xuzhou campaigns, the failure of the price control policy, and the fact that Acting President Li only holds a nominal title. The Garrison Headquarters considered that the newspaper's comments had no basis and summoned Gong for questioning. After asking higher authorities for instructions on the evening of the 6th, it was decided that the newspaper should be suspended for three days for failing to exercise proper editorial control, and President Gong Debai received a severe warning. Gong was detained in the Garrison Headquarters for less than 20 hours and returned to his residence that night.

### Commander of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, Zhang Yaoming, Issues Statement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] Commander of the Capital Garrison Headquarters Zhang Yaoming issued the following statement regarding the punishment of the Salvation Daily and the questioning of its publisher, Gong Debai, on the evening of the 5th: (1) In the Salvation Daily's editorials on the 4th of this month, "The People Demand Clarity in the Political Situation," and the 5th, "China Cannot Be Saved Unless Chiang Kai-shek Leaves the Country," the paper slandered President Chiang, who led the completion of the Northern Expedition and the victory in the War of Resistance, and who took the lead in retiring to seek peace; insulted Acting President Li, who took office in a time of crisis and made the greatest efforts for peace; falsely accused high-ranking generals who died in battle and those currently serving; and fabricated rumors to provoke the relationship between the retired President Chiang and Acting President Li, conspired to undermine unity, instigated political unrest, added to the government's difficulties, and hindered the progress of peace. It also used alarmist language in an attempt to create chaos in people's minds and disintegration from top to bottom, leading to a situation of being caught between war and peace. This vicious conspiracy is truly harmful to the entire nation. After the newspaper's two editorials were published, the military and civilians of the capital were filled with anger. This headquarters has repeatedly received reports that many people wanted to take direct action against the newspaper. This headquarters is responsible for the security of the capital and cannot sit idly by while the newspaper wantonly incites provocation and causes unrest in the capital. Therefore, in accordance with Article 11 of the Strict Laws, this headquarters temporarily closed the newspaper. (2) The newspaper's editorial on the 4th stated that President Chiang "violated the opinions of all the generals in the Northeast, causing the entire elite army to be wiped out," "he is still issuing orders," and he wants to deal with the Gui clique. "There is also an enemy in the city of Nanjing," "There is another enemy in Hankou, and I don't know how many enemies there are in each province." It also said that Acting President Li is "this kind of puppet" and that in the editorial on the 5th, "But Chiang is hiding behind the scenes and controlling everything," "The good time of these two months has completely disappeared due to Chiang's infighting." What is the basis for all of this? What evidence is there? It is necessary to question the publisher of the newspaper, Gong Debai, in order to clarify the truth, and then ask higher authorities for instructions.

### He Chengjun Speaks in Guangzhou

Says This Trip is Unrelated to Politics; Will Go to Hong Kong for Recuperation Soon

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th] Hubei Provincial Council Speaker He Chengjun, due to foot disease and high blood pressure, went to Hong Kong for recuperation on doctor's orders.

Military and political leaders here, such as Yu Hanmou, Xue Yue, and Zhang Fakui, are all old friends of mine for many years. Since I have come to Guangzhou, I will naturally visit them separately. This is purely personal in nature and has nothing to do with politics at all." He will be staying in Hong Kong temporarily in the near future and will return to Hubei once his condition improves.

### Nationalist Army Recaptures Beichao Dam Near Taiyuan; Municipal Council Cables Executive Yuan to Allocate Civilian Food

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th] Small-scale skirmishes have been frequent around Taiyuan in recent days. The Communist army on the southwest line of the city has been very active recently, constantly harassing the Nationalist army's positions. In order to eliminate the threat, the Nationalist army launched a mop-up operation on the 5th against Beichao Dam, about 20 miles away from the city on the west bank of the Fen River. After a battle, Beichao Dam was captured. In the evening, small skirmishes occurred on the line from the southeast to the northeast of the city. In the southeast, the Nationalist army launched a search and suppression operation against the Communist army in the northwest area of the mountains north of Qianjiazhai.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 6th] In order to solve the grain shortage problem, the Taiyuan Municipal Council recently pleaded with the central government on behalf of more than 300,000 citizens to allocate civilian food. The original telegram stated: "To Premier Sun Ke of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, greetings. Taiyuan has been besieged for a long time, and there is a shortage of food. It is now spring, and the old crops have been exhausted before the new crops are ready. Nine out of ten households in the city are empty-handed and have nothing to cook. It is difficult to find even grass roots and tree bark to satisfy their hunger. We sincerely request that the Executive Yuan allocate food, strengthen air transport, enrich civilian food, and save those who are in danger, in order to enhance the strength to defend Taiyuan. The telegram is urgent and we cannot wait any longer."

### Ministry of Industry and Commerce Considers Replacing Commercial Representative to Japan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] The government's commercial representative to Tokyo is about to be replaced. The incumbent Tang Jusheng will be transferred to another position. The successor is currently being considered by the responsible Ministry of Industry and Commerce. It is reported that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's proposal is related to the report made by the representative to Japan, Shang Wang Zhuoran and seven others, who returned to the country from Tokyo to report to the authorities on trade with Japan. Since January of last year, the government has sent four batches of commercial representatives to Japan, totaling ten people. Recently, eight of them returned to the country and submitted three opinions to the authorities: (1) reduce control over trade with Japan, (2) abolish quotas for exports to Japan, (3) carefully select commercial representatives to Japan. The main figures had come to Beijing a few days ago to pay respects to the relevant authorities, and Da Niu had returned to Shanghai one after another, but Wang Zhuoran was still staying in Beijing. According to the statement, if the government attaches importance to the development of trade with Japan, this matter has great prospects. Not only can agricultural products be exported, but also cotton textiles can be exported to Japan for the use of 30,000 overseas Chinese.

### Vice Minister of Finance Liang Yingwen Flies to Beijing to Report on Financial Revenue and Expenditure to the Legislative Yuan; Liu Jianqun Arrives in Beijing from Shanghai and Talks at Length with Tong Guanxian

[United Press, Guangzhou, 6th] It was pointed out here on the 6th that developments have finally overcome the insistence of the members of the Legislative Yuan in Guangzhou, and they are now preparing to return to Beijing to attend the plenary session. It is said that the more than forty members of the Legislative Yuan who are still here are preparing to attend the Nanjing meeting that will begin this week. The members of the Legislative Yuan held a final meeting here today to persuade the stubborn elements who are still insisting on staying in Guangzhou. Because the members of the Legislative Yuan in Beijing were unable to obtain a quorum and the members of the Legislative Yuan in Guangzhou failed to win enough support to continue their work, this change occurred.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 6th] Members of the Control Yuan began to register on the 6th and will hold a plenary meeting on the 12th to severely criticize Premier Sun Ke of the Executive Yuan for engaging in illegal trading.

### Hong Kong Merchants and Trade with North China

â€” Our Hong Kong Correspondent, Ziji

Hong Kong merchants have a very beautiful slogan, which is "Business is Business." Under the premise of this slogan, their most urgent move at the moment is to restore commerce between Hong Kong and North China. After two to three months of preparation and planning, this move has now transformed from an ideal into a reality.

After the Hong Kong government spokesman officially announced on March 1 that the Hong Kong government would not prevent ships from sailing to ports under the control of the Chinese Communists, the Taikoo liner "Hanyang," originally scheduled to sail to Incheon, South Korea, on the 3rd, began loading goods destined for Tianjin. It was rescheduled to depart on the 5th, planning to sail to Tanggu first, and then proceed to South Korea. This is the first vessel to formally trial sail between Hong Kong and Tianjin. After this news spread, the ship immediately received about 2,000 tons of cargo, with a freight rate of HK$150 per ton. The shipping company stated that if the goods could not be unloaded at Tanggu, they would be unloaded at Incheon instead, to which the merchants had no objection.

According to investigations by this reporter: The Hanyang is carrying mostly newsprint, rubber, Western medicine, hardware, and pigments, as well as some transportation equipment. It is said that the newsprint includes the eighty-pound Taolin paper that the Chinese Communists recently dispatched people to Hong Kong to buy up, which is being rushed to Beiping for printing "North China People's" banknotes. The Panama-flagged merchant ship Greenana, which recently sailed to North Korea, also carried a large quantity of this paper.

In the past two days, an advertisement has appeared in Hong Kong newspapers saying: "A new vessel from a neutral country is scheduled to sail to Tianjin on March 10, carrying passengers and cargo." Those "business is business" figures are actually holding up the banner of a "neutral country." Their "logic" is truly unbelievable!

Trade between Hong Kong and the areas under the control of the Chinese Communists did not begin today, and Hong Kong's trade with North Korea has already begun. There are frequent Soviet, Portuguese, and Panamanian vessels traveling between Hong Kong and Zhennampo in North Korea. According to the captain of the Portuguese vessel "Hua Zhong," his ship has gained considerably from going to North Korea, recently carrying 300 tons of Western medicine, paper, and industrial equipment, in exchange for over 1,000 tons of bristles and soybeans (which are famous products of the Northeast). Last winter, a Soviet vessel loaded with more than 3,000 tons of Northeast soybeans arrived in Hong Kong, exchanging them for auto parts, rubber tires, etc. Just as it was entering the port, it was sunk to the bottom of the sea by a larger British freighter. According to a merchant who told this reporter: Three months ago, someone rented a freighter of only 600 or 700 tons, loaded a batch of goods, and ventured to sail to Andong in Northeast China, near North Korea, exchanging them for a large quantity of soybeans, pig bristles, and horsehair, making a profit of four times. One merchant said: Although there are still some political and diplomatic entanglements to be resolved regarding the restoration of trade between Hong Kong and North China, the Chinese Communists need the supplies that Hong Kong provides even more than Hong Kong needs the raw materials of the Northeast and North China. The future of this business, in any case, is always promising.

In addition to the North China market, Hong Kong merchants have recently set their sights on the "new continents" of Hong Kong's ports, Hong Kong-Taiwan, and Hong Kong-Wuzhou. Let me briefly say a few words about each of them: Since 1947, "Japanese goods" have made a comeback, flooding the Hong Kong market. However, that was handled by the Hong Kong government and the Allied Headquarters in Tokyo. Recently, General MacArthur, in order to reward Japanese goods for finding overseas markets, welcomed merchants from various countries to come directly to Japan for procurement. Hong Kong merchants believe that the time is ripe and are making plans to travel east. China Airlines, seeing their needs, promptly organized a tour group to Japan, taking more than 20 people in the first batch, and the second batch is about to depart.

Just as Hong Kong merchants were on their way to Japan, a mining exploration team from Taiwan arrived in Hong Kong to discuss ways to promote trade between Taiwan and Hong Kong. They plan to exchange Taiwanese coal for British mining equipment and other industrial raw materials, which Hong Kong merchants are also very happy about.

The Executive Yuan recently announced in Guangzhou the opening of Wuzhou, allowing foreign merchant ships to sail up the West River and restore foreign trade in Guangxi. The inland river navigation rights that were recovered after the war have now been lightly given back. Hong Kong merchants, taking advantage of foreign ships, are about to open up a market. In the past, Wuzhou products had to be exported through Guangzhou, but now this detour can be avoided. This is seen as a "benefit" by Hong Kong merchants, but as a "harm" by Guangdong merchants. With conflicting interests, Guangdong merchants have sent a telegram opposing the government's opening of the Pearl River, accusing it of repeating the "Qing Dynasty's mistakes"!

Taking advantage of Shanghai merchants being mired in the civil war, Hong Kong merchants not only have the ambition to encompass trade in the Far East, but also want to compete for the European market. Last year, several units participated in British industry and trade fairs, with quite a few promising "buds." This year, they have great ambitions and are going to London again to "knock on the door." This, in terms of business is indeed a good thing.

### Editorial: Will Soviet Diplomacy Undergo a Transformation?

Moscow Radio announced on the 4th: Foreign Minister Molotov has been dismissed from his post, and his vacancy will be filled by Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky; Minister of Foreign Trade Mikoyan has also been dismissed at the same time, and his vacancy will be filled by Menshikov. At the same time, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Gromyko has been promoted to Deputy Foreign Minister to fill Vyshinsky's vacancy. The news of this major personnel change in the Soviet cabinet is tantamount to throwing a bomb at countries around the world, shaking the entire globe, and causing a series of serious questions to arise in everyone's mind: "What will the Kremlin do now?" "Will Soviet foreign policy change?" London and Washington are still adopting a wait-and-see attitude, and observers generally dare not jump to conclusions. But from our point of view, Molotov has been in office as Foreign Minister for more than ten years since succeeding Litvinov in 1939. Now that he has been dismissed, there must be a profound significance to it. Will the Soviet Union's future foreign policy undergo some changes?

Anyone who studies Soviet foreign policy admits that the foreign policy adopted by the Soviet Union in the past 30 years can be divided into three stages. From the success of the Soviet social revolution and the establishment of the Soviet government to the resignation of Foreign Minister Chicherin in 1930, this was the first stage of Soviet diplomacy. At that time, the Soviet Union was abandoned outside the international community. On the one hand, capitalist countries regarded the emerging Soviet Union as a flood, and they were on guard against its attempts to communize the world. Even the idea of â€‹â€‹a joint attack on the Soviet Union by the great powers was prevalent for a time. On the other hand, the Soviet Union also chanted the theory of "world revolution," attempting to lead all the oppressed and small nations of the world to unite against imperialism. At that time, Lenin also said such a sentence: "Socialist countries and capitalist countries can never coexist at the same time. Either we communize the whole world, or the socialist country will be divided by capitalist countries."

But after Litvinov succeeded Chicherin as Foreign Minister in 1930, Soviet foreign policy underwent a 180-degree turn, not only abandoning the proposition of world revolution, but also openly calling for a "peaceful diplomatic policy." Litvinov used his flexible diplomatic skills to achieve amazing success in a few years, not only restoring diplomatic relations with capitalist countries one after another, but also concluding non-aggression treaties and mutual assistance treaties with France, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Finland, and the Baltic countries. In September 1934, the Soviet Union joined the League of Nations. When Litvinov stepped into the assembly hall of the League of Nations, he was warmly welcomed by representatives of various countries around the world, and he became a "peace angel." He first put forward the slogan of "peace is indivisible," which is still praised by people as the golden rule. But when Litvinov was suddenly dismissed in 1939 and succeeded by Molotov, Soviet diplomacy entered its third stage.

At the beginning of Molotov's tenure as Foreign Minister, the Soviet authorities repeatedly denied that there would be any changes in foreign policy; but objective facts proved that the Soviet Union had abandoned its peaceful diplomatic policy and adopted a "realist" diplomatic policy instead. The signing of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact on August 24, 1939, was an excellent proof. Later, when World War II broke out, Molotov reported on the international situation, saying that "the current war has the nature of a scramble between imperialists" and believed that it was beneficial to the social revolution led by the Soviet Union, until the German army moved east and invaded the Soviet Union from Poland, then it suddenly realized that World War II was a war between aggressors and anti-aggressors, and the Soviet Union could only defeat the aggressors by working together with the United Nations. During the war, Molotov made great contributions to strengthening the unity and cooperation between the United Nations, but after the victory of the war, he could not escape considerable responsibility for the division of the world and the separation of the United States and the Soviet Union. Today, the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union is intensifying, filling the international community with hostility and moving step by step towards a new international war. The crisis of World War III is imminent, and the United States has no choice but to take the initiative in diplomacy. The active implementation of the Marshall Plan, the vigorous promotion of regional security mechanisms, and the recent negotiation of the Atlantic Pact are ostensibly for peace, but are they not actually aimed at the Soviet Union? In addition, Norway's refusal to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union and its firm desire to join the Atlantic Pact, and Denmark's similar tendency, further illustrate Molotov's failure in Europe. Under these circumstances, a change in Soviet diplomacy seems to be an inevitable trend. Molotov's dismissal may be a harbinger of a change of course in Soviet diplomacy.

Rumors of Molotov's dismissal have been around for a long time, and have been heard from time to time; the differences between Molotov and Stalin are also widely rumored. However, because we are outside the Iron Curtain, we do not know the Soviet political situation in great detail, so we dare not speculate. Now that Molotov has been dismissed, there is sufficient reason to believe that Soviet diplomacy, after Vyshinsky takes office, can be further unified under Stalin's sole authority. Vyshinsky is Molotov's powerful assistant, who often "engaged in verbal battles with the Confucian scholars" at United Nations conferences, showing his sharp edge, and even people in Western countries admired his skills; but he has no opinions on Soviet foreign policy, and even less ambition. In the future, he will only take Stalin's opinions as his own. Although Stalin's peace offensive has not been successful, it is foreseeable that Vyshinsky will continue to strengthen it for a period of time in the future.

### Naval Headquarters Dispatches Aircraft to Reconnoiter the Coast for the Chongqing Warship; Low Pay for Officers and Soldiers is the Main Reason for Defection

Mr. Gui Yongqing's Remarks

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] After the disappearance of the Chongqing warship, the Naval Headquarters has obtained some information and is now dispatching aircraft to patrol the coast. On the morning of the 6th, Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing told reporters: There were about four or five hundred officers and soldiers on board the ship when it defected; one of the reasons for the defection was the dissatisfaction of the officers and soldiers with the excessively low pay. When they were training in England, they were paid in pounds. When they returned to China, they were treated as public education military personnel, and their lives were difficult. When the news of the ship's defection came out, he was in Anqing. He originally planned to return to Shanghai immediately, but he was unable to return due to official duties. Recently, he used wireless radio to broadcast to the officers and soldiers of the ship in English, asking them not to make the greatest mistake in history and to be ridiculed at home and abroad, and that all issues could be discussed. After the broadcast, he has not received a reply from the ship. He also said that no warship is allowed to move freely without the order of the Naval Headquarters. The ship's captain may have falsely claimed an order or used the excuse of training the army to leave the Wusongkou. When asked by reporters whether the ship had any possibility of returning, Mr. Gui replied: "We have not yet fallen into despair." When reporters asked about "the consequences that the ship's defection could cause," Mr. Gui did not answer.

Rumor is that it has Arrived in Dalian

[Reuters, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] A spokesman for the Second Fleet of the Navy told this agency in Zhenjiang that after the defection of the Chongqing cruiser, it added fuel in Yantai and has now arrived in Dalian. At the same time, Naval Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing told reporters in Beijing that when the Chongqing sneaked out of the Yangtze River estuary a week ago, it deliberately sailed back and forth, seemingly testing the engine, in order to avoid the attention of the coastal battery. When it sailed outside the range of the battery, it accelerated north and escaped into the high seas.

[United Press, Nanjing, 6th Dispatch] The mystery of the disappearance of the naval cruiser Chongqing remained elusive on the 6th. The previous rumors that the ship had sailed north to Yantai and surrendered to the Chinese Communists were difficult to confirm, because government reconnaissance planes had twice gone to Yantai to reconnoiter, but had not found the ship.

### Hong Kong's Imports and Exports Last Year Exceeded All Previous Records; HSBC Bank Manager Speaks at Board of Directors Meeting

[United Press, Hong Kong, 5th Dispatch] HSBC Bank Manager Mr. Morse said at the bank's annual board meeting that those engaged in foreign trade in China will inevitably face a completely new situation in the coming years. However, Chinese and foreign merchants with experience in trade in China will not give up in disappointment. It is undeniable that China urgently needs to import consumer goods and production equipment, and needs to export goods in exchange for imports. Hong Kong's import and export trade in 1948 exceeded all previous records. In terms of value, it was three times that of 1938; in terms of quantity, it has recovered to pre-war standards. Foreign exchange control and export control have not affected the increase in trade. Last year, the total value of Hong Kong's trade with Japan and Korea was HK$56 million. Air transport has also expanded greatly. Last year, there were 227,000 air passengers, compared with only 28,000 in 1946. HSBC Bank's net profit for last year was HK$16,792,000, an increase of HK$278,000 compared with 1947. The balance under the settlement item was HK$2.665 billion, an increase of HK$244 million compared with 1947. The amount of banknotes in circulation at the end of last year was more than HK$728 million.

### Dazong Mediation Reaches the Outskirts of Yuanling; Negotiations with the Rebel People Begin; External Contact with Chenxi is Interrupted and the Situation is Chaotic

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 6th Dispatch] Yuanling telephone at 8 pm on the 6th: There was no war in Yuanling all day on the 6th. Provincial Security Deputy Commander Wang Jinxi and the Dazong mediation team led by Dai Jitao have arrived at Wangwangpo (3 li from the city).

Also, regarding the previous telegram about the instability of the 10th Regiment Commander Wang Yuanhua, according to accurate information, one battalion of Wang's troops is moving towards Dayong County, surrendering to Dayong County Chief Xu Junhu. Dayong is still peaceful. Another battalion was transferred to Chenxi to fight, while Wang himself is missing.

[Another Telegram] Huaihua telephone: The people of Chenxi are fleeing to Huaihua. External contact with Chen has been interrupted on the 6th, and the situation is chaotic. It is said that Changsha's evening newspapers and Shupu and Huaihua are all tense, which is completely inaccurate according to investigations.

[Our Newspaper, Changsha, 6th Dispatch] This reporter recently visited Li Moan. He tried his best to avoid giving a positive answer to the Xiangxi incident, only saying that the chaotic situation in Xiangxi was not as serious as the rumors. Also, slogans denouncing Li Moan were posted all over Changde City. Li's return to the 17th Security District of Changde is quite problematic under the current situation.

### Taiwan Provincial Police Department Supplements Explanation on Entry Methods

Permit Valid for Three Months

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 6th Dispatch] The temporary measures for the entry of military and public personnel and passengers formulated by the Taiwan Provincial Authorities were implemented on March 1. The Provincial Garrison Headquarters has specially released the following four supplementary points on the measures: (1) The term "and their family members" in Items 1 and 2 of Article 2 refers to direct relatives and must come to Taiwan with the military and public personnel at the same time. If the family members of military and public personnel come to Taiwan alone, they should be handled in accordance with general passengers. (2) The passenger entry permit referred to in Article 1 of Article 2 must be approved and issued by the Provincial Government and should be sent directly to the original applicant by the Police Department to save time. (3) The "document of proof issued by the Special Commissioner's Office of Guangdong and Guangxi for passengers coming to Taiwan from Hong Kong" referred to in Item 7 of Article 3 can only prove the identity of the passenger, and the applicant must still fill in the application form for entry passengers and submit it to the Special Commissioner's Office of Guangdong and Guangxi. The office will send it to the Provincial Police Department at any time, and after obtaining the entry passenger permit in accordance with these measures, they can enter Taiwan. The Special Commissioner's Office of Guangdong and Guangxi has been notified to handle it. (4) The validity period of the entry military and political personnel certificate and the entry passenger permit is three months and can only be used once and will be collected by the entry inspection personnel.

### Taiwan Province is Experiencing a Drought and Water Shortage, Resulting in a Sharp Decrease in Electricity

If There is No Rain, Electricity Use Will Be Restricted

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 6th Dispatch] According to Sun Yunxuan, Director of the Mechanical and Electrical Department of the Provincial Electric Power Company, Taiwan's power system mostly uses hydropower, and its output depends on the amount of electricity. This year, the amount of electricity in Taiwan is scarce, even more so than the driest year in the past (the great drought in the spring of the 35th year of the Republic, according to statistics, was the first time in 100 years). According to the cumulative flow of the Zhuoshui River, the lowest in the past was 72,000 days (units), and this year it is 55,038 days (units). It is still difficult to predict how long this drought will last. The water stored in Sun Moon Lake is only more than ten feet. If there is no rain this month, from the beginning of April, electricity use throughout the province will be restricted by more than half. In order to cope with this serious situation, the company has begun to slightly reduce the weekly rate and voltage since the 2nd. At the same time, it calls on users throughout the province to avoid using electric stoves, automatically conserve electric lights, suspend advertising neon lights, and factories that can take advantage of this period to repair machines. Factories with automatic generators are encouraged to use them as much as possible to overcome the difficulties together. New factories moving to Taiwan may be affected by this and delay their start.

He did not make a speech but adopted a free-flowing conversation format. The spring sunshine was bright, and the hosts and guests were all delighted. According to Zhou's words to reporters, Hangzhou relies on spring for three seasons' worth of income.

### Soviet Supreme Decisions Controlled by Politburo; Basic Policies Unlikely to Change; Gromyko Promoted to First Deputy Foreign Minister

[Reuters, Moscow, 5th] Moscow Radio announced today that the Soviet Council of Ministers has appointed Gromyko as First Deputy Foreign Minister to succeed Vyshinsky after his promotion to Foreign Minister. Other Soviet Deputy Foreign Ministers are currently Zorin, Gusev, and Malik. Like Vyshinsky, Gromyko attracted worldwide attention for his speeches at United Nations conferences. Gromyko succeeded Litvinov as Ambassador to the United States in 1943 and served until April 1946.

[Reuters, London, 5th] Sources here believe that the change of Soviet Foreign Minister is merely a simple reorganization within the Soviet government and should not be seen as a surprising dismissal. A Foreign Office spokesman declined to comment officially, but according to this agency's diplomatic correspondent, the British government is not yet willing to conclude that Molotov has been dismissed or that Soviet foreign policy is about to undergo a fundamental change. Judging from the simultaneous departure of Trade Minister Mikoyan, it can be seen that these two veteran Soviet politicians will now concentrate their efforts on assisting Stalin in the decision-making of the Soviet Communist Party's political strategy. Therefore, they have to get rid of the daily administrative affairs in the cabinet. British sources familiar with Soviet affairs believe that the dismissal of Molotov and Mikoyan from their cabinet posts is only an administrative reorganization. Therefore, rather than regarding them as dismissals, it would be better to call it promotions. After being relieved of their cabinet duties, they can devote all their energy to participating in top-level decision-making and also share the burden of Marshal Stalin, who is already 70 years old. Vyshinsky was in Czechoslovakia when he was transferred to his new post, so there is absolutely no possibility of him ousting Molotov to take his position. Vyshinsky's appointment as Foreign Minister is actually a demotion of the Foreign Ministry rather than a promotion of Vyshinsky. The change of the Minister of Foreign Trade is also the same.

### Future Soviet Foreign Policy Will Control the Asian Continent; U.S. State Department is Preparing Countermeasures

[Reuters, Washington, 6th] After Vyshinsky took office as Soviet Foreign Minister, the U.S. State Department worked as usual this weekend to prepare appropriate countermeasures on the U.S. side. The news that Vyshinsky happily attended a banquet to entertain North Korean representatives in his capacity as Foreign Minister added to the U.S.'s attention to this change of Soviet Foreign Minister. Washington has gradually come to believe that this change of Foreign Minister is a sign that the Soviet Union is shifting its position to Asia after the failure of its diplomacy in Western Europe.

State Department officials pointed out that Molotov's dismissal must be due to the Soviet government's deep understanding that it must immediately seek countermeasures against the trump card of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Molotov's policy of making every effort to win over Western Europe has proved fruitless to this day. Therefore, Vyshinsky's rise indicates that future Soviet foreign policy will reverse its past style and focus on Asia, placing Europe in a secondary position. Therefore, Vyshinsky's hosting of a grand banquet for the North Korean delegation at the beginning of his tenure as Foreign Minister is of considerable importance. An official here frankly predicted that Vyshinsky will definitely make up for the losses of communism in Europe by gaining ground in Asia in the future. Washington believes that the Soviet Union will intensify the war of ideologies in Asia and the Far East in the future to balance the equilibrium overturned by the North Atlantic Treaty. The Kremlin expects that the China problem will be resolved by the victory of the Communist Party this spring, and the Burmese government will inevitably collapse at that time. These two major changes will completely change the political situation in Asia and allow the Soviet Union to easily gain control of the Asian continent. Strategically speaking, the realization of these two major developments will wipe out the efforts of Britain and the United States in Asia.

### Change of Soviet Foreign Minister: New Wine in Old Bottles

Vandenberg Issues Criticism

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] White House Secretary Hassett told reporters today that President Truman had no comment on the change of Soviet Foreign Minister. The President also did not mention Molotov's departure at his regular meeting with his aides today. Republican foreign policy leader Vandenberg commented that the change of Soviet Foreign Minister was merely the replacement of a cruel person with a heartless person. Molotov and Vyshinsky were the pair who spoke out the most against efforts to destroy peace.

Pan Youxin Had Requested Release

[Central News Agency, Washington, 5th] Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin visited U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Webb and Assistant Secretary of State Rusk today to request the release of Soviet engineer Gubichev, who was arrested for allegedly stealing U.S. government secret documents. However, the State Department told Pan that the department still needs to study this issue. Pan declined to comment to reporters after leaving the State Department. The Gubichev case seems to confirm the report of Alexander, Deputy Chief of the Passport Visa Section of the State Department, to a congressional committee last July, that hundreds of undesirable elements entered the United States under United Nations passports.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] A spokesman for the House Un-American Activities Committee said on the 5th that they may investigate allegations that Soviet representatives to the United Nations were involved in internal espionage activities in the United States.

### Western European Communists Support the Soviet Union; Soviet Newspaper Praises

[Reuters, London, 5th] Moscow Radio today broadcast an editorial from the Red Star newspaper, saying that the recent speeches by Communist leaders from France, Italy, Britain, Germany, Norway, Mexico, and other countries show how strong the strength of peace-loving friends who oppose international reactionary forces has reached. The Communists, who lead the struggle of various nations for peace and democracy, have definitely stated that the working class of these countries will actively oppose the international reactionary forces' conspiracy to invade the Soviet Union. The ruling classes of Britain and the United States are engaged in uniting various aggressive blocs to find a way out of the economic crisis within capitalist countries. It must be known that the more aggressive the policy of the enemies of peace is, the more united the democratic camp will be.

[United Press, Buenos Aires, 5th] The Argentine Communist Party declared that the Argentine Communists will "do everything possible" to ensure the victory of the Soviet Union in the Third World War.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 5th] French Communist Party leader Thorez reiterated in a speech in Sur Seine, central France, today that if the Soviet army occupies France, the French Communists will not resist. He said, "War-mongers have been enraged by my declaration, but the people support us. If the authorities take legal action against us, then 500 people can justifiably prove that they are now preparing for a war against the Soviet Union." Thorez continued to discuss the French government's economic and financial policies, saying that the large increase in military spending has reduced us to a state of slavery in order to trap us in the war advocated by the Gaullists.

### Truman Recommends to Congress to Improve U.S. Defense Agencies and Grant Extensive Powers to the Secretary of Defense

The President urged that the previous recommendations be implemented as soon as possible to unify the nation's military command so that defense spending is not wasted.

### U.S. Secretary of the Army's Determination to Leave is Firm; Secretary of the Navy Will Be Transferred to a New Position

[United Press, Washington, 5th] Reliable sources say that Secretary of the Army Royal will resign around the 15th of next month. When Truman announced the resignation of Secretary of Defense Forrest and the succession of Johnson a few days ago, he said that the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force would remain unchanged, but the Department of the Army still said that Royal's determination to leave was firm. In addition, it was heard that Secretary of the Navy Sullivan will also be transferred to head the Department of Commerce, and his vacancy will be filled by Daniels, the son of the former Secretary of the Navy. After Royal resigns, it is rumored that his vacancy will be filled by Army Undersecretary Clay.

### Underground Movement Behind the Iron Curtain: Collecting Intelligence and Guiding Refugees to Flee; The "E" Symbol Discovered on the Streets of the Czech and Hungarian Capitals

[Reuters, Frankfurt, 6th] The English letter "E," which has been chalked on walls at night on the streets of Prague and Budapest, shows that the anti-Communist movement behind the Iron Curtain is growing, just like the "V" symbol during the war. The letter "E" represents the newly created "Europe of Unity and Freedom" movement. Refugees who have escaped from behind the Iron Curtain have been spreading the news of the birth of the resistance movement behind the Iron Curtain. Germany has become a distribution center for these refugees. Recently, secret meetings were held on the borders of two Communist countries to unite these refugees, and the participants were all figures who led isolated resistance movements. The "First Column," which is the resistance movement behind the Iron Curtain, was born because of this meeting. Its current strength is still not comparable to the underground movement during the war. Its main work is currently limited to collecting intelligence outside the Iron Curtain, issuing propaganda materials, and organizing the escape of refugees. It is reported that there are at least six secret newspapers in Poland, at least three in Hungary, and at least two in the Czech Republic. Underground workers in Poland have several short-wave radio stations to communicate news with foreign countries, and the "underground railway" in various Communist countries, which is an organization that guides refugees to flee, is also becoming more sophisticated. They use a chain system, with each refugee responsible for guiding a refugee, connecting station by station, until they reach a safe area. It is said that no more than 5% of the people who flee are arrested on the way, which shows the effectiveness of the system.

### Soaring Prices Need to Be Contained Urgently; Governor of the Central Bank Flies to Beijing to Discuss Countermeasures with the Minister of Finance; Will Return to Shanghai Today and Sell Gold, Silver, and Materials Again

[Our Report] After the announcement of the new financial and economic reform plan, the implementation details have not yet been published. At this time when decisions have not been made, speculators are taking the opportunity to manipulate the market. Prices first rose gradually and then soared. According to statistics, the increase rate of general prices in the past week was at least 50% and at most more than 100%. The lives of ordinary citizens are greatly threatened. Liu Gongyun, Governor of the Central Bank, therefore took a flight to Beijing in a hurry at around 8:00 AM yesterday. According to reporters, Liu is scheduled to return to Shanghai by evening train that day, so he should arrive at the North Station this morning. Although Liu did not state his mission on this trip, it is widely believed that he will seek another effective remedy from Finance Minister Xu to address the current situation of price fluctuations in Shanghai. The details are roughly as follows: (1) How to continue to implement the Central Bank's selling policy (including gauze, sugar, rayon, raw silk, gold and silver, foreign exchange transfer certificates, gold bonds, stocks of state-owned enterprises, etc.). (2) How to restore and organize the gold and silver markets that have been closed for a long time. (3) How to overcome the various practical difficulties caused by the actual collection of commodity taxes. (4) How to improve the pricing issues of public utilities. Observing Liu's hurried trip, regardless of whether Finance Minister Xu can immediately grant all the effective remedies, it is widely believed that the Central Bank will have a temporary emergency measure for its movements in the market from today onwards to combat this direct upward surge. At the same time, it is generally believed that Liu's trip will have some remedial and decisive impact on the implementation details of the financial and economic reform plan that will be announced soon.

[Central News Agency, This City] In view of the rapid surge in prices these days, the authorities have now decided to take effective measures to stabilize them. According to a Central News Agency reporter who learned from reliable sources yesterday, the Central Bank has decided to continue selling gold, silver, and a large number of foreign exchange transfer certificates to contract currency. As for the stock exchange, in addition to Taiwan Sugar stocks and gold bonds that have already been listed, preparations are being made to list and auction China Textile stocks and the 36th year U.S. dollar bonds immediately.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Liu Gongyun, Governor of the Central Bank, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 6th. Liu paid respects to Acting President Li and President Sun, and after meeting with Xu Kan, he returned to Shanghai by night train on the 6th.

### Shanghai and Taiwan Have Long Had Arbitrage Transactions; Black Market Exchange Rate is One to Eighteen

[Our Report] It is reported that since Taiwan Province banned the exchange of funds between Taiwan Province and various provinces in the country, the remittance of funds for the industrial and commercial sectors has become very inconvenient. However, those who import materials into Taiwan Province can remit part of the payment through the official exchange rate, but the amount is very limited. Affected by this, the arbitrage transactions between this city and Taiwan Province have emerged. It is said that those who operate in this way, in addition to small banks and shops that have long had connections with Taiwan Province, many companies that have dealings with various places in Taiwan Province also adjust the remittance of funds in both places through account transfers. However, since the funds remitted from Taiwan are more than the funds remitted from Shanghai to Taiwan, the official exchange rate is 10 Taiwan dollars per Gold Yuan, while the black market exchange rate is about 18 Taiwan dollars per Gold Yuan.

In the past two days, they temporarily suspended distribution to "avoid the limelight." Yesterday, being a Sunday holiday, these unregistered publications reappeared in large numbers on street newsstands. It is reported that the relevant authorities, in order to implement government orders, will conduct another inspection immediately.

### University Professors' Association Decides to Rename and Expand Organization; Expresses Dissatisfaction to the Executive Yuan with New Public Education Treatment Measures via Urgent Telegram; Insists on Issuing According to Original Salary Multiplied by Index

[Our Report] The Shanghai Municipal National College and University Professors' Association held its fifth regular meeting at the Shanghai Business College yesterday afternoon. In addition to representatives from ten universities in the city, including Jiao Tong University and Fudan University, there were also new members' representatives from Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, the Art Vocational School, the Suzhou Social Education College, and Henan University. Therefore, it was decided to expand and rename the organization the Shanghai Regional National College and University Professors' Association.

### Hong Kong Telegram on Cotton Stock Exhaustion, Cotton Textile Industry Authority Analyzes

[Our Report] A Hong Kong telegram reported that the cotton stock of yarn factories in this city is only sufficient for consumption until the end of this month and will be completely used up. Yesterday, the reporter consulted a certain authority in the cotton textile industry in this city for his opinion on the news. According to him, this news may refer to the current situation of some private yarn factories in this city. Some private yarn factories in this city had transferred their funds abroad successively due to the critical situation in the Jinghu area, resulting in a decrease in funds to replenish raw cotton. Moreover, the overall situation is still uncertain, so the business policy of each factory has not been clearly determined. Most factories tend to purchase raw materials in succession when needed and stop when not needed, resulting in a significant reduction in the raw cotton stock of each factory. According to general estimates, the cotton stock of each private factory in Shanghai is roughly sufficient to continue operating for one and a half months. The raw cotton stock of each factory under the State-owned Textile Construction Company is relatively abundant. In addition to its own stock, plus the raw cotton obtained from the export of yarn and cloth, the raw cotton entrusted by the US Aid Cotton Committee to spin cotton yarn, and the raw cotton entrusted by the National Cotton Joint Purchasing Office, it is estimated that the cotton stock is sufficient to continue operating for three months. Recently, the company will receive a third batch of approximately 28,000 bales of US aid cotton (500 pounds per bale), so the raw cotton supply will not be panicked for the time being. Recently, due to the abundance of raw cotton sources, the general operating system of each factory under the company has been changed to five days and six nights per week from this month onwards in order to increase the supply of yarn and cloth and stabilize the price of yarn and cloth.

### Self-Prepared Car Robbed on Hami Road, North Xinjing

At the same time, Shunhexiang Tobacco and Paper Store, Wansen Sauce Garden, and Chenwanxing Noodle Shop were also robbed nearby. After twenty minutes, they took the stolen goods and fled west, stealing twelve gold rings, over one million gold yuan, and over forty cartons of cigarettes, and fired three shots in the air as a show of force before leaving.

### Giant Thief Caught Again, "Ci Gei Kunshan" Arrested at North Station, Wearing Newly Made Military Uniform, Resembling a Major General

[Our Report] The "Four Famous Mountains" theft gang, famous in the rear during the Anti-Japanese War, came to the Jinghu area after the victory. In the spring of the year before last, Sun Xiaoshan, Liu Hangxia, and others were arrested and sentenced to imprisonment by the District Court of this city. Recently, the Railway Police Department arrested a habitual thief. It is reported that the thief is the well-known "Kunshan" among the "Four Famous Mountains." When he was arrested, he was wearing a newly made wool military uniform and wearing major general shoulder boards, and his actions and deportment resembled a senior military officer.

### Shanghai and Changzhou are Conducting Exchanges of Materials between the Nationalist and Communist Areas, Personnel are Now Being Sent to Discuss Technicalities

[Our Report, Wuxi, 5th] Ever since the peace envoys returned to the south, issues regarding transport and material exchange between the Government-controlled regions and the Communist regions have begun to show signs of progress. Reportedly, after the Shanghai National Products Ten Factories Export Office General Manager Qian Chengxu sent personnel as representatives of the production sector in Jinghu to make contact with the commercial sector in the Communist region, the latest news is that progress has been made with the exchange of materials between Xuhuai and Jiangnan. At the same time, Xu Huai Products Joint Operating Company General Manager Ning Huage, Anhui Enterprise Company Executive Director Lu Yizhai, Bengbu Daming Company General Manager Jiang Yaoxuan and others have successively gone to Shanghai via intermediary routes to meet with Qian, expressing that there are large quantities of cotton, wheat, and coal in Xuhuai and other places that can be exchanged. Qian made a special trip to Nanjing to report to the authorities and, upon returning to Shanghai, proposed discussions with the Wujin County Chamber of Commerce. Reportedly, the Wujin side plans to provide 10,000 bolts of twill white cloth in exchange for cotton, soybeans, and coal, while the Shanghai side plans to provide national product finished goods, such as new medicines, cotton fabrics, dyes, electrical appliances, sugar, and yarn, in exchange for cotton and coal. Combining the amounts from Shanghai and Changzhou, the initial back and forth can barely cope. As for the location of the exchange, Nanjing determined it to be Jingjiang. However, because Jiangyin is closer to Xichang, it is more cost-effective to use Xisha, and it is also more convenient to transport back cotton, so Qian Sunqing, Chairman of the Local County Chamber of Commerce, was sent a special letter yesterday, reviewing the process and hoping that Xichang would take consistent action, because production is currently facing extreme difficulties, and fuel coal and raw cotton are even more scarce. At the same time, Qian was asked to discuss the details with Rong Desheng for an exchange of opinions. As for technical issues, Shanghai has dispatched a special envoy on the 2nd of this month to Xu Huai to formally discuss the matter with commercial representatives from the Communist region, and they will be able to return to Shanghai to report in the next few days. According to the reporter's words from Chairman Qian, due to the fact that there are many factories in the town and all raw materials need to be circulated urgently, they are conducting careful research. As soon as the details of the material exchange are decided, they will be announced publicly.

### The Second Annual Meeting of the Science Periodical Association, Zhang Mengwen Delivers Speech Explaining the Basic Mission, Printing and Textile Industries Host Banquets for Members in the Evening

[Our Report] The Chinese Science Periodical Association held its second annual meeting at the Chinese Science Society on Shaanxi South Road at nine o'clock yesterday morning. More than 200 people attended, including representatives from 32 member publications of the association and guests Mao Yisheng, Zhao Zukang, Xu Junyuan, Qiu Weiyu, and others. Chairman Zhang Mengwen delivered an opening speech, taking "Science and Society" as the theme. He believed that the basic mission of scientific periodicals is to popularize scientific knowledge to the public, starting from explaining scientific principles and then promoting it to striving for democracy and freedom. In today's Chinese society, the value of popularizing the true meaning of science is far greater than the popularization of applied scientific achievements. This is: demanding freedom and impartiality, rejecting secrecy and selfishness, recognizing the truth, and not asking about authority and power. Scientific periodicals should shoulder the task of the times by targeting the shortcomings of today's Chinese society, teaching the public to clearly understand the true meaning of science, distinguish right from wrong, not ask about power, demand freedom, and reject autocracy. This task far exceeds the mere popularization of technical knowledge.

Mao Yisheng gave a speech on "The Mission of Scientific Periodicals," and put forward four hopes to the colleagues of scientific periodicals: (1) Each periodical should have at least one person engaged in its industry for life. (2) Each periodical should have its focus of effort. (3) The publication periods should be coordinated with each other, and those of the same type should not be published at the same time. (4) Apply unified terminology. He also hoped that through the efforts of Chinese scientific periodicals, all aspects of Chinese politics and economics would have a scientific spirit.

Guest Xu Junyuan delivered a speech, believing that scientific publications should go to the countryside, and that the lack of popular education is also one of the reasons why scientific publications are not selling well. He hoped that newspapers could establish connections with publications in the future. Zhao Shikang also emphasized that science should penetrate into the countryside and industrialize the countryside. Qiu Weiyu believes that the methods of popularizing science education should include holding more mobile science lectures and screening science films. After the guests finished their speeches, they continued to elect and photograph, and the printing industry hosted a lunch. In the afternoon, the annual meeting was held again at the China Textile Society on Dihua Middle Road for a special discussion, presided over by Qiu Weiyu and Chen Pingcheng, and the topic of discussion was "The Future Mission of Chinese Science Periodicals." Then Zhang Mengwen presided over the discussion of association affairs. In the evening, the textile industry hosted a dinner, with a lottery for extra fun.

### City Hall "Miracle": The Tragic Lives of Low-Level Civil Servants - Section Chief Eats Noodles, Laborers Sleep on the Floor, Unable to Support Children, They Are Sent to Orphanages

[Special Report from This Newspaper] The City Hall building, standing at the corner of Jiangxi Road and Hankou Road, is the heart of Shanghai. All official documents related to municipal construction flow through it daily, like blood circulating through arteries and veins. The rhythmic beating of this heart sustains the prosperity of this international city. But today, it is suffering from severe anemia. If not treated promptly, its cells will soon die. One can easily imagine the disastrous consequences for Shanghai if the heart stops working. Living in this magnificent building are over a thousand people under Mayor Wu Guozhen. They sit in this building from morning to night, regardless of the fact that the cost of living has jumped to 643 times its original level. After the announcement of the new economic plan, prices have soared again, and public utilities are chasing after the U.S. dollar. Yet, to this day, their salaries are still calculated based on the government's announced cost-of-living index for civil servants, which is 75 times the base salary. This reporter specifically calculated that Mayor Wu's monthly salary is 17,400 Gold Yuan. The salaries of lower-level civil servants below the mayor are mostly less than 10,000 Yuan, and what about the laborers with a base salary of 60 Yuan? Today, they receive 4,500 Gold Yuan.

Mayor Wu's Salary - Barely Enough to Buy a Pair of Socks

I remember once asking Mayor Wu, "How do you spend this little money you get?" The mayor replied with a smile, "I give it all to my wife." In fact, the mayor's salary is only enough for his wife to buy a pair of silk stockings. However, no one worries about the mayor's livelihood. But how do those lower-level civil servants who earn a few thousand Yuan a month live? In other words, how does the group sitting on the cold bench in the "cold palace" survive? Isn't this a "miracle"? I believe curious people would certainly like to know how this "miracle" is producedâ€¦

A year ago, there was a section chief named Wei Xiaogang in the News Department of the Municipal Government. Perhaps few people knew him then, and it is even harder for anyone to remember him now, because he has long become a victim of this "miracle." Section Chief Wei was tall, wore a pair of thick tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, and sat at his desk all day, wielding his pen. He was skilled in drafting official documents and had beautiful handwriting. He was actually in his forties, but he looked at least fifty due to his aged appearance, and he was still a bachelor. Wei Xiaogang was by no means a dull and repulsive old curmudgeon. He was a normal person with reasonable needs, but the unreasonable reality deprived him of them. Those close to him often heard his theories on love, proclaiming everywhere that he wanted to form an alliance to pursue love, with himself as the leader, and he made many allies.

Office Desk by Day, Bed by Night

I remember that news reporters who covered city hall news at that time loved his sense of humor and often enjoyed chatting with him. Sometimes when we talked late into the night in the news office, we would suggest going to a restaurant for a "dragonfly touching its tail," which meant everyone paid for themselves. At such times, he would always slip away because he couldn't afford it. He would secretly sneak to the beef noodle stall on Erma Road to eat his plain noodles, which was his usual dinner. After finishing, he would return to city hall, feeling his way up the dark stairs, and sleep on the desk where he worked during the day. That was his home. In the newsroom closet, there was a tattered cotton quilt that hadn't been washed in two years, which was the precious item that kept him warm every night. The next morning, he would get up, wash his face with cold water, and sit at his desk as usual, doing those monotonous tasks like a machine, never missing a shift. One day, Section Chief Wei suddenly disappeared. It was said that he was sick. Not long after, news of his death came. Of course, this bad news didn't cause a sensation in city hall, because he was just an ordinary section chief. Although if you went to the personnel department to check, you would know that being a section chief is not easy. One needs a university degree and experience as a senior clerk in a government agency. Now Section Chief Wei is dead. He was swallowed up by a hellish life. If he were still alive, wouldn't he be an example of a "miracle"?

700 Last Month, Haven't Received This Month's Yet

Wei Xiaogang was a section chief. Today, a section chief can still receive about 10,000 Yuan. So how can lower-level employees, who are even worse off than section chiefs, survive? To uncover the root of this "miracle," this reporter also interviewed a city hall laborer. He is 34 years old, originally from Hebei Province. During the Anti-Japanese War, he enlisted in the army and fought on the front lines in Zhabei twice. After the victory, he was introduced to work as a laborer in city hall. He cleans the offices during the day and sleeps on the floor at night. He eats one porridge and two meals a day in the city hall cafeteria, because it is run by the Employee Welfare Committee and the prices are much cheaper. But after paying for his meals, there is very little money left. Sometimes he can't even afford to get a haircut or take a bath, and he always borrows from his colleagues. He said that last month he received a salary of 700 Yuan, and he hasn't received this month's yet. He sighed and said, "I can only live one day at a time, hoping not to starve to death." Fortunately, neither Section Chief Wei nor this laborer had a family (although they were both of marriageable age), so they only had to feed themselves. But what about those civil servants who have families and many children? What kind of "miracle" do they have?

Monthly Salary of 4,000-5,000 - Not Even Enough to Buy Noodles

Opening the newspaper from two days ago, there was a shocking record on the local news page: "Yesterday, a civil servant in this city, unable to make ends meet, reluctantly sent his four children to the Taixing Road Women's Rehabilitation Center, requesting relief. The situation is extremely tragic. Mr. Huang, who received higher education and has served in a government agency in this city for many years, currently lives in the city hall employee dormitory. His monthly salary is 4,000-5,000 Yuan, and he receives three dou of rationed rice. This meager amount is not even enough for a family to buy plain boiled noodles. He cannot afford the tuition, which is calculated in rice per student. This civil servant resolutely took his daughters Huang Xiaoqing (7 years old, second grade), Huang Dongchan (11 years old, fifth grade), Huang Lingzhu (12 years old), and Huang Suzhen (14 years old, sixth grade) to the rehabilitation center. The children cried and told people, 'Mom took two younger brothers and was evacuated to the countryside in Hangzhou, so Dad can live well in Shanghai.' The father separated from his daughters with tears in his eyes. When leaving, the director of the rehabilitation center told him, 'We don't have advanced classes here, so the older children's schooling will be a problem.' The civil servant smiled bitterly and replied, 'Now we can't talk about schooling or not. We just need to fill our stomachs.'"

Too tragic, there is no need to expect any more miracles. This kind of life is already a "miracle" in human history! Who is without natural feelings? What parent in the world can bear to be separated from their own flesh and blood? Today, the lives of civil servants are indeed in dire straits. They have reached the point where they cannot survive even by tightening their belts. If reasonable improvements are not made in time, it is expected that all kinds of tragic "miracles" will continue to emerge, and the consequences will be unimaginable.

Now, the magnificent City Hall building has become a dark hell on earth, with groups of civil servants struggling on the brink of death. May the ruling officials have mercy!

### All England Badminton Championships Conclude: Malayan Chinese Doubles Unparalleled in the World, Freeman Defeats Wong Peng Soon Again, Still Maintains Singles Throne

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 5th (Radio): The champions of the five titles of the All England Badminton Championships have been determined after four days of intense competition among 178 players. Malaya and China won the men's doubles, the United States won the men's singles and mixed doubles, Denmark won the women's singles, and England won the women's doubles.

Today, the Haringey Arena was attended by 7,000 spectators. In the first event, the women's singles final, Miss Kirsten Thorndahl of Denmark, after a three-game battle, defeated her doubles partner Miss Tonny Ahm 8-11, 11-8, 11-4, winning the championship.

Although Freeman defeated Wong Peng Soon 15-1, 15-6 to dominate the men's singles, the intensity of the battle was unprecedented for the young doctor who has been undefeated since the age of eighteen.

Wong Peng Soon was still abnormal at the beginning of the game, and Freeman easily scored nine points in a row. After that, Wong Peng Soon began to be smoother, forcing Freeman to go through a period of struggle for every point. Later, when Wong Peng Soon pulled back a point with a very beautiful and accurate smash, Freeman's racket was too long to reach, and he even cried out.

Wong Peng Soon had an excellent performance in the second game, once forcing Freeman to be at a disadvantage with 5-4. Unfortunately, he gradually showed fatigue after that, and Freeman took the opportunity to counterattack, winning seven points in a row. Although Wong Peng Soon tried to struggle, it was only a flash in the pan, and he lost 6-15. Freeman thus stepped onto the throne of the world badminton world. According to this All England Championship, all the players representing Malaya, China, the United States, Denmark, India and other places to participate in the Thomas Cup International Tournament are included, so the champion of the competition is also the world champion.

In the women's doubles final, Mrs. Uvarova and Miss Allen of England defeated the defending champions of the previous tournament, Mrs. Ahm and Miss Sander of Denmark, with 15-8 and 15-10.

The men's doubles championship was won by Wong Peng Soon and Chong Cheng Koon. The opponents were Freeman and Rogers, who were defeated in the Thomas Cup. At the beginning of the game, the American team took a 4-0 lead, but Wong and Chong of Malaya immediately rose up, chasing to 4-4. After that, they avoided the heavy and attacked the weakness of Rogers' defense, and the strategy worked. Soon they won the first game 15-5.

In the second game, the Malayan Chinese team continued to be vigorous, not giving Freeman a chance to show his skills, and won again with 15-4.

According to the men's doubles semi-final, the Yang Teh Tsai and Tseng Kuan Liang team was eliminated by Freeman and Rogers with 15-5, 5-15, 15-4. The Lin Kee Fong and Ong Poh Lim team of Malaya were defeated by Wong and Chong in the same room with 2-1.

The last event, mixed doubles, was won by Mr. and Mrs. Stephens of the United States. The Stephens couple relied on their excellent tacit understanding to overwhelm the American-British Allied Forces of Rogers and Miss Chilver with 15-5, 5-15, 15-12.

### By One Point, Hua Lian Loses to Foreign Soldiers

[Report from This Newspaper] Last night in the A1 group of the basketball league, the overlord Hua Lian was tragically defeated by the U.S. Navy Pfeiffer by one point. The score was 44-43. In the first half, Hua Lian led by two points, 23-21. The main reason for the victory or defeat lies in the words "spirit" and "strength". Hua Lian seemed to underestimate the opponent at the beginning of the battle, but it was too late when Pfeiffer gained the upper hand. This is enough to give Hua Lian a lesson. The performance of the black player Brown of the other side was very moving.

In the women's group, the Green team won the Li team by a large margin with 49-13, and the A2 Fat team won Jian Le with 42-35.

### Railway Uses All Its Might, Defeats Zhi Chao 3-1, Will Compete with China Aviation for the Championship This Weekend

[Report from This Newspaper] In another match of the Mayor's Cup Football Tournament, the railway team, with its average talents and flexible coordination, fought hard for 90 minutes and finally eliminated Zhi Chao 3-1, winning the right to the final. Under the leadership of Gao Baozheng, the railway team's forwards and defenders are indeed better. Although Zhi Chao has Wu Qixiang sitting in the center, it is difficult for him to fight alone. The whole team lacks stamina and is unable to reverse the situation. Yesterday, the weather was sunny and spring was full of vigor. More than 3,000 fans were in high spirits. The referee was Zhang Le, and the linesmen were Wu Shouheng and Lu Shunde. The railway team and China Aviation will compete for the Mayor's Cup championship this weekend.

The railway team attacked first, and Lu Qingxiang approached the door directly. Wu Qixiang fired a cannon head-on, repelling the enemy. Zhi Chao counterattacked, and Qian Yuanqing and Zhu Jiazheng attacked from the left, returning without success. Zhu Chengjiao sent a high ball far away. Yu Qia and Xiang rushed straight to the railway gate. Liao Xiong rushed out, Gao Baozheng restrained them, Xu Dawei pulled, and the ball flew out of bounds. The railway team attacked, Cao Liming sent the ball, Wu Binghao headed it, and Sheng Peter hugged it full. The railway team fought back, Lu Bingsheng passed forward, Xiao Ziwen headed, but it was not successful. This back and forth, stalemate for 36 minutes, Lin Dianyi attacked straight along the side, kicked it accidentally, Zhang Jie kicked and the ball fell, and the railway team took the lead 1-0 in the first half.

In the second half, the railway team's offensive became more intense. The tug-of-war situation in the first half gradually changed. Half an hour passed, Xiao Ziwen got the ball later, and Wu Qixiang was actually deceived, making another contribution. The railway team took a 2-0 advantage. Wu Qixiang worked hard to strengthen himself, and personally led the expedition, opening to the front line, and exchanging positions with Xu Guoping. However, the young generals under his command were already exhausted, and Ziwen took the opportunity to come again. One kick hit the post and bounced out, Lu Qingxiang rushed up and kicked it in, and the score became three straight. The big labor has gone, Zhi Chao borrowed a city, attacking endlessly. Outside the railway gate, Cao Liming touched the football with his hand and was sentenced to a free kick. Zhi Chao Lu Yide sent it, urgently and far away, Shang Shiqi picked over Yue Renxiao, Wu Qixiang approached the gate and chained it, the ball entered the white line, Zhi Chao pulled back a goal, Zhu ate a duck egg, 3-1 ending.

### Sports World Post-Railway War Review

Watching the railway team and Zhi Chao compete is like watching Wu Qixiang and Gao Baozheng fighting. However, Baozheng is cheaper in that the collocation is more complete, while Qixiang is only able to support the building, before and after, he must rely on one person to support it. Peony is difficult to be good, and green leaves are still needed to support it. Some people say that if Zhi Chao had two Wu Qixiang, one in the front and one in the back, it would be good.

Although Zhi Qi is a new army, under the influence of Wu Qixiang, it has improved a lot compared to the beginning of the season. This is due to Qixiang's contribution.

In the heyday of Qingbai, the current strong generals have been scattered. Baozheng leads the railway, Qixiang supports Zhi Chao, Gao Xiuqing is the pillar of China Aviation, and Wu Kaimin is also the main general of the Dragon Head. Only Meng Yiliang is left in Qingbai, and he is promoting his successors. If Yan Shixin comes to organize a bank fellow team next season, and Afu also changes to another team, then it would be interesting to have old friends of Qingbai as the main brain of each team.

Shang Shihong on Zhi Chao's right wing performed well in the first half, with speed and brains, but the disease is that the position is too backward and refuses to go deep. In the second half, his strength was exhausted, and his activities were greatly reduced as a result.

Jiang Lei is also visible, but when the enemy's peak gets the ball, he retreats too quickly, so the defense zone is forced to shrink. If the enemy's peak has a good long shot, then it is not his fault that he has made a contribution.

The intermediate avant-garde of the railway team has a tacit understanding and good cooperation, which is quite salty. Zhang Jie has speed, and Xiao Lu assisted in the promotion, forming a small triangle in the middle. Wu Binghao on the left wing passed with a way, but the speed was not enough. Lin Dianyi on the right wing had speed, but he could only go straight forward. He would pass from a long distance, so some people say that the railway team's attack is a dimensional attack, or a central breakthrough.

The Mayor's Cup Qingbai suffered an unexpected poison, and the railway's fortune came suddenly. It is hoped that this cup will be touched. However, it is said that China Aviation has borrowed generals from Xiangdao, so it is difficult to rest easy when strong enemies are in front of us.

The penalty kick king "Zhang Le" enforced the law, but did not award a penalty kick once, which shows that the two sides kicked very politely. (Qiu Shigong)

### Spiritual Therapy to Cure Gambling Addiction

â€” Zhuxi

There is a great mind scientist in the United States named Harre Zola, who has an amazing ability to observe the mind. He has a particularly sensitive memory for numbers. You can write a number in each of the fifteen squares on a large grid, and Harre only needs to glance at it to be able to recite those numbers one by one in order, without any mistakes. He can also use mental arithmetic to add up the numbers in each horizontal or vertical row. Some mathematicians one day brought a calculator specifically to compare the speed of calculation with him, and the result was: the calculator could not keep up with him.

Harre performed magic tricks at amusement fairs, earning $2,000 a week, but he was still not satisfied. He thought: Why can't he use his brainpower in a more profitable setting? So he started gambling.

Isn't gambling just a scientific application of the law of chance? Who can calculate these laws of chance more accurately than a great mathematician? When a die rolls a four, what is the chance of rolling it again? Harre knows this. He can calculate it to several decimal places. But the fly in the ointment is that the winner never belongs to Harre. His explanation is: "If I could bet one more time, I would definitely win, but unfortunately I have run out of money."

The money that Harre earned from his mathematical talent was sent to the gambling table. He calculated that he had lost a total of $167,438.50.

Psychologists studied his memory methods and mathematical abilities, and at first they did not understand why such an intellectually gifted person was so easily deceived. But later they realized that gambling had become a habit for Harre, like an addiction.

Dr. Brugler, a psychiatrist in New York, once did some research on this and came to the conclusion that gamblers who are addicted to gambling are neuropathic patients who cannot control their behavior. Later, they take pleasure in pain and delight in loss.

A certain authoritative scholar once said that a gambler is an unrepentant and incurable offender. But psychiatrists mostly disagree. They believe that gamblers can be cured with psychiatric therapy, but it is often easier to persuade an alcoholic or drug addict to change than it is to persuade a gambler to change his ways. According to Brugler, gamblers have the following six characteristics:

1. Gamblers have a habitual tendency to take risks and speculate;

2. The fun of gambling is higher than all other fun, and his thoughts are all focused on gambling;

3. Gamblers are often optimistic and are not discouraged by failure;

4. Gamblers are reluctant to stop when they win money, and are reluctant to quit when they lose money.

5. Although they start carefully, they later do not hesitate to put all their eggs in one basket, and can bet on the rent they have to pay, the food expenses for next month, the money entrusted to them by others, or the public funds they handle.

6. In the period after betting and before the outcome is revealed, the gambler has a happy and painful tension and excitement. It can be said that gamblers enter the game in order to win money, or in order to "make a profit," but in fact, this is often not the case, but a desire to pursue mental stimulation.

The only way to treat gamblers is with psychiatric therapy. If there is an opportunity to find out where the root of the disease lies, treating the gambling disease with psychiatric treatment can often be effective. When the patient realizes that gambling is a hobby that wants to harm others or harm himself, he will begin to realize it, and will eventually have the perseverance to quit gambling one day.

### That's How It Is

At a night dance, a beautiful young lady had a gold chain around her neck, from which hung a small, exquisite gold airplane. A young man stared at it.

"Do you admire this little airplane?" the lady asked. "No, miss," the young man replied. "I admire this landing strip." (Li)

### Legends About Women

â€” Lan Ning

There is an ancient myth in Sanskrit classics that when the heavens and earth were first created, the world was created by the great god. He used various elements to create the sun, the light and stars, the valleys and forests, and finally man.

All the solid materials had been used up in creating man, so when he wanted to create woman, he had nothing left. The great god then gathered the roundness of the moon, the trembling of the water snake, the winding of the kudzu vine, the slenderness of the rose vine, the delicacy of the flowers, the lightness of the green leaves, the swiftness of the fawn, the brightness of the sunlight, the fine tears of the mist, the fleetingness of the breeze, the timidity of the wild rabbit, the vanity of the peacock, the softness of velvet, the hardness of diamonds, the sweetness of honey, the cruelty of the tiger, the warmth of fire, the cold of snow, the garrulousness of the starling, the melodiousness of the turtledove... He mixed all these together and created woman. He gave woman to man as a companion.

Thus, man's life was filled with joy because he now had someone to share the pleasures of the world with. Together they strolled on the pine-covered meadows, listened to the songs of the birds, and held hands watching the sunrise. At dusk, they marveled together at the ever-changing clouds in the sky after sunset.

But after some time, the man went to see the great god and said:

"Take her back, take back that woman you gave me, because she poisons my existence. She nags constantly all day long, eroding my time, preventing me from completing the more glorious and sacred tasks I aspire to accomplish. She often cries for no reason, and she is often ill."

So the great god took her back. But eight days later, the man appeared before the great god again.

"God," he said, "how lonely my life is since that woman left. Give her back to me! Because I remember her light figure dancing before me, I remember her sweet laughter filling my heart with joy. I remember how she nestled against me, and how sweet and comforting her presence was when the sun set, the day's work was done, and darkness surrounded me."

So the great god sent the woman back to him. However, after only a month, the man came to plead with him again.

"God," he said, "I don't know what it is. I don't understand, but I do know that that woman gives me more harassment and trouble than joy. I beg you, great god, take her back again."

The great god replied, "Go back, do your best to get along with her."

"But I really can't live with her anymore."

"However, you cannot live without her either," God concluded.

This conclusion is said to have not changed to this day.

### On "Song of the Forest"

â€” Wang Ce

Before introducing "Song of the Forest", let me briefly mention "The Red Shoes" released by "English Lion", which has a similar theme. "The Red Shoes" tells the story of a ballet dancer who, after falling in love, cannot balance her career, leading to suicide by jumping off a building. The whole play is full of melancholy and dreaminess, it brings tears to the eyes, and also makes people sigh at the fate of artists. In addition, the color, lighting, and scene changes in the film are extremely magnificent. In American and British films, it is well-loved.

However, the new Soviet film "Song of the Forest", which has a similar story to "The Red Shoes", clearly has a great difference in theme from "The Red Shoes". "The Red Shoes" represents individualism and decadence. For all musicians, artists, and dancers, when measuring art and love, the individual's "weight" is much stronger than other factors. The heroine of "The Red Shoes" is reluctant to give up her lover, cannot let go of dancing, and ultimately commits suicide. Her ending is certainly tragic, but limited to individualistic sorrow.

And the musician in "Song of the Forest" does not put love in the first place. Although his hand was injured in the war, making it impossible to play the piano, he resolutely picked up the accordion, hid far away in the Siberian forest, sang for the broad masses of the people, and wrote more meaningful music for people who truly love music.

Just as the female singer Natasha condemns another accordion player in the play:

"You only know yourselves, you are selfish and self-serving. Although you are a famous pianist, what relationship do you have with the people?" (General idea)

China has no shortage of many academic musicians who indulge themselves in ivory towers, listen!

The folk-style chorus in "Song of the Forest" is the essence of the entire film and is worthy of praise.

The Chinese dialogue always feels inappropriate. With a red-haired, blue-eyed person, even if the Mandarin is spoken well, the audience will burst into laughter in many serious scenes. This dubbing method, I personally think, is not advisable.

### My Humble Suggestions

â€” Suo Bei

In order to implement the "Financial Reform Plan", to suppress prices, stabilize finance, and benefit the people's livelihood, I solemnly put forward a "well-intentioned" and "constructive" proposal. If adopted, the country will be "fortunate" and the people will be "fortunate"!

(1) The market price of gold dollar banknotes is rising very quickly. In order to prevent public utilities from suffering major losses, it is proposed that the "unit pricing" system of "only raising prices once a day" be amended immediately, that is: adjust according to the market price of gold dollar banknotes on the same day, making "dynamic adjustments" at any time.

(2) In order to show that "the common people are also allowed to light lanterns" and to advocate democracy, the fees for all public places (such as cinemas, theaters, game halls, restaurants, bathhouses, hotels...) and the prices of all shops and vendors can be adjusted dynamically at any time according to the "scientific method" adopted by the above-mentioned public utilities. But in any case, it is not allowed to directly price and pay in Guan Yuan, silver dollars, US dollars, or Hong Kong dollars, because the gold yuan coupon "is still the only legal currency." This point must be strictly observed to maintain currency credibility and benefit the people's livelihood. Those who dare to deliberately violate it will be severely punished without leniency.

(3) In order to reduce the burden on the national treasury, take into account the difficulties of manufacturers, and prevent foreign-run electric lights, trams, and water plants from making too little profit, all public teachers and professional workers' salaries shall be discounted according to the original practice, according to the current or previous index, and paid in one lump sum, without supplementation. Those who make excessive demands, take the opportunity to raise treatment, or conspire to riot will be sent to the security organs and severely punished in accordance with martial law to serve as a warning to others!

### Tit for Tat

When the famous playwright George Bernard Shaw's masterpiece "Man and Superman" was first performed in New York by a famous theater troupe, it was a huge success and attracted a large crowd. The next day, the director received a call from Shaw:

"Wonderful!"

The director replied to Shaw: "You're too kind, not necessarily!"

The next day, the director received another call from Shaw:

"I was talking about the script!"

In the afternoon, Shaw also received a reply from the director:

"I was also talking about the script."

### "The Moon and Sixpence"

â€” Xia Lin

The atmosphere in Shanghai is really too depressing, let's talk about something else.

"Golden Gate" has been showing "The Passionate Sinner", a film adapted from the novel by British writer W. Somerset Maugham, since last Saturday. Maugham is not an unfamiliar name in China. His works that have been adapted into films by Hollywood, such as "The Letter", "Rain", "Of Human Bondage", and "The Razor's Edge", which has not yet arrived in Shanghai, are all related to "The Passionate Sinner". It is based on "The Moon and Sixpence", which is Maugham's famous work (1919). The protagonist Strickland in the novel was originally a stockbroker in London. Because he was fascinated by art, he abandoned his family and went to the Latin Quarter of Paris, where he experienced a series of turbulent romances, and finally found the natural beauty he was pursuing on a coral island in the South Seas. The story is quite similar to the life of the modern French painter Gauguin, so some people say that Maugham had a picture of Gauguin in his mind when he wrote "The Moon and Sixpence". But Maugham did not admit it, so of course no one can prove it. Maugham's latest book is a religious novel "Catalina" published last year, which was serialized in Harper's Bazaar.

"Naoxin Jiujiu has become a center for music and dance. The Municipal Symphony Orchestra holds performances here every two weeks, and English ABC plays are performed here. Whether it's a drama, a concert, or even Yue opera, everyone wants to compete for this venue. Half of the reason is, of course, that there are no fixed tasks here, and half is because this art palace with historical significance is most suitable for song, dance, and drama performances. This Thursday (the 10th), the Shancheng Chorus, which has come from afar, will perform the opera "Love of the Sea" here. According to Wang Yunjie, the music director of the troupe, this is a new attempt based on the Italian opera format. "Love of the Sea" is based on Loti's novel "An Iceland Fisherman", composed by Feng Dun and directed by Zhu Chongmao and Jin Ge. The Shancheng Chorus is said to have been an amateur organization in Chongqing during the War of Resistance, a group formed by young people who endured hunger and worked hard for art. The economic foundation of "Love of the Sea" is not solid. With the help of many friends, they managed to put together the money to realize this performance. Hopefully, they will succeed and open up a new field for the barren land of art in Shanghai.

Shanghai's music scene is as desolate as the drama scene. It's really difficult to listen to a weighty piece of music to wash away the psychological fatigue of the week. But Shanghai Radio (900KC) has a classical music program every Sunday morning from 10 to 12, with few commercials and very carefully selected music. They have broadcast Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony, Bizet's L'ArlÃ©sienne Suite, Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite, and Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade Symphonic Suite, all of which are familiar pieces. For music lovers, these two hours are a rare enjoyment. This week
