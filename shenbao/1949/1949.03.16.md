### Director He Arrives in Beijing and Makes a Statement: Peace Talks Are Expected to Proceed Quickly; Government Representative Candidates Will Be Changed; Foreign Policy Will Continue to Implement a "Pro-Humanity and Good Neighbor" Policy

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] The newly appointed President of the Executive Yuan, He Yingqin, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai at 2:30 PM on the 15th by special train. His wife, Ms. Wang Wenxiang, Bei He Zongyan, Chief of General Staff of the Ministry of National Defense Gu Zhutong, Section Chief Liu Wenjin, and others accompanied him. Secretary-General of the Presidential Office Weng Wenyuan, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan Chen Kewen, Vice President of the Control Yuan Liu Zhe, and the heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan, including Bai Chongxi, Xu Yongchang, Gui Yongqing, Zhou Zhirou, and more than a hundred representatives, all welcomed him at Xiaguan Railway Station. Mr. He was wearing a suit and overcoat with a happy expression on his face. His wife was wearing a black woolen coat. After getting off the train, they shook hands with those who came to greet them and exchanged pleasantries before getting into a car and returning to the official residence at Jiming Temple. At 5:00 PM, he met with reporters and stated that the new cabinet would strive for a peace that suits China's situation, conforms to the people's opinions, and is fair and just, in order to lay the foundation for a united and democratic China with long-term stability and security. Mr. He also said that peace talks with the Chinese Communist Party are expected to proceed quickly. As to whether the peace talk representatives will be changed or slightly increased, Mr. He replied that some of the representatives appointed by the previous Executive Yuan have firmly declined, such as Peng Zhaoxian, who must be replaced, but no increase has been considered yet. Secondly, Mr. He emphasized the importance of linking peace with the current economic problems. When reporters asked him about his meeting with financial figures in Shanghai and what countermeasures he had to rescue the economy, Mr. He replied that his understanding of economic policy was like "a blank sheet of paper," but after studying it and discussing it with financial figures in Shanghai for several hours yesterday, he had come to understand that there was always a solution, but a policy must have the support of the people nationwide in order to be effective. At the same time, economic problems are linked to peace. With peace, people's lives can be stabilized, and the economy will thus be stable. On the issue of US aid, Mr. He believed that if any country knows of China's difficulties and provides assistance, we should accept it. Subsequently, Mr. He answered inquiries regarding foreign policy, stating that the foreign policy will continue to implement the previous policy of "pro-humanity and good neighbor." Regarding military reform, he replied that military reform is our current most important task, and military leaders in all regions advocate this. Finally, Mr. He answered the following questions regarding the various issues of forming the cabinet: the formation of the new cabinet is not yet complete since there was no prior preparation, so the decision on the list of names and when it will be announced are still pending. Moreover, the Executive Yuan's plan to simplify the organization is currently being discussed in the Legislative Yuan, so it is not yet known how the various ministries and commissions will be merged. We will discuss it further after meeting with Legislative Yuan member Chen Guyuan, who proposed the plan. Mr. He also said that it is currently very difficult to find people from all sides because they are scattered in the north and south. It is very difficult to form the cabinet immediately in this very short period of time. Regarding the results of inviting Yan Huiqing, Jiang Yong, and Zhang Shijian, as well as members of the Democratic and Youth Parties, to join the cabinet in Shanghai, Mr. He reported that Yan and Jiang had both decided not to participate, while Zhang had agreed to consider it. The Democratic Socialist Party's reply was that it would be decided after the party meeting. The Youth Party has accepted the intention to join the cabinet. Mr. He also said that the number of cabinet members given to the Youth Party is still one minister. Regarding the issue of Shao Lizi, Zhang Zhizhong, and Wu Tiecheng joining the cabinet, Mr. He said that after seeking the opinions of the three, Zhang had agreed to participate, Wu had expressed that he could consider it, and Shao was unwilling to serve as a cabinet member but was still willing to be a peace representative. Mr. He finally said that the position of Deputy President of the Executive Yuan has not yet been considered, and he denied the rumor that Gu Weijun had been invited to serve as Minister of Foreign Affairs. This press conference of Mr. He's was held outdoors in his official residence after being surrounded by reporters. Mr. He's attitude was amiable.

### Acting President Li Visits Mr. He: The First Draft of the Government's Peace Talk Plan Will Be Handed Over Within Days; The Formation of the New Cabinet May Take a Week

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] Acting President Li personally visited President He's official residence at Jiming Temple at 3:15 PM on the 15th. Zhang Zhizhong, Shao Lizi, and Wu Zhongxin were all present at the time. Acting President Li immediately had a close-door talk with the four in his living room for nearly two hours, which ended at 5:00 PM. It is believed that they were discussing matters related to the formation of the cabinet, and the sound of laughter and conversation reached the outside, which seemed to indicate that there were many optimistic prospects for the deployment of the new cabinet. At about 8:00 PM in the evening, Mr. He went to Chuanhougang to pay his respects to Acting President Li and further discussed the candidates for the new cabinet until he returned to his official residence at nearly 11:00 PM.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] The first task of He Yingqin's new cabinet after its formation is to intensify preparations for the peace talks. The change of President of the Executive Yuan has in fact delayed the start date of the peace talks. Mao Zedong told the Shanghai People's Delegation that the peace talks would be best to start after March 15th, but as of the 15th, the government's preparations have not been completed. The preliminary opinions of the government's peace talk plan drafted by the ten-member group led by Sun Ke have been studied several times by Acting President Li and important officials such as Zhang Cui, Bai Chongxi, Cheng Qian, and Wu Zhongxin. In order to show respect for the facts of the cabinet's tenure, Acting President Li will transfer the opinions to He Yingqin. The task of Sun Ke's ten-member group has been completed, and He Yingqin will decide how to study in the future. The peace talk plan must also be approved by the He cabinet before it can be discussed. As for the government's peace talk representatives, in addition to Zhang Zhizhong and Shao Lizi continuing to serve, Huang Shaohong's intention to resign has been retained by Acting President Li and can be expected to be dismissed. In the future, only two or three other people need to be selected, and the candidates will also be decided by the new Executive Yuan meeting.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] The process of forming the new cabinet may take a week. As far as can be ascertained so far, the cabinet members invited by Mr. He include people from all walks of life, and especially attach importance to authoritative figures who have always advocated peace. Therefore, Mr. He's new cabinet is obviously a cabinet of peace. It is heard that Mr. He once invited Wu Tiecheng to serve as the Deputy President of the new cabinet. Wu had agreed to go to Guangzhou to handle the handover matters and then return to Beijing for further consideration. Some people believe that Huang Shaogu has the greatest possibility of becoming the Secretary-General, followed by Hong Lanyou, Zhang Daofan, and Peng Zhaoxian. As for the most important Ministry of Finance, Xu Kan may continue to serve as the minister, while Lu Xuen's Minister of Foreign Affairs is one member who is closely watched but difficult to find an answer. As for whether the Minister of National Defense will be concurrently held by Mr. He, Mr. He told reporters that he has not considered it yet. It is also heard that Fan Yushui and Wang Qijiang, both members of the Legislative Yuan, have been recommended to join the cabinet, but there is no news about the results.

### Members of the Legislative Yuan Send a Letter to Mr. He Suggesting Careful Selection of Cabinet Members

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] On the day that He Yingqin arrived in Beijing to begin forming his cabinet, some members of the Legislative Yuan sent a letter to Mr. He criticizing him and making suggestions on personnel issues. The letter stated: "The country is in a difficult situation, and it is becoming more and more serious. The people are suffering, and they are in dire straits. Since the advocacy of peace, the situation has changed, and the political foundation is entirely based on reform. A glimmer of hope depends on the new cabinet, which is extremely important and significant. We agree with your appointment to form the cabinet, one to accomplish the task of peace talks, and the other to implement thorough reform measures. We hope that you will be careful from beginning to end, and do not allow stubborn elements who believe in military force to join, which will block the door to peace. Do not let incompetent opportunists fill the posts, which will block the path to talent. Those who have failed, how can they be tried again? Those who are dying are eager for regeneration. Water can carry a boat, but it can also capsize it. The support or opposition of the people is the barometer of the government. We dare to offer direct advice, and we hope you will consider it carefully." The letter was signed by Jing Juetian, Kong Geng, Rong Chunlin, Huang Jianzhong, Li Feng, Luo Xiatian, Li Shijun, Gan Jiaxin, Zhang Pingjiang, Miao Qiping, Lu Yuwen, and more than 30 others.

### Control Yuan Impeaches Sun Ke for Secretly Ordering the Allocation of Funds to Several Banks

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] The case of former President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke's handwritten order to Minister of Finance Xu Kan to allocate 110 million gold yuan from the secret office expenses when the Executive Yuan was evacuated has been investigated by Control Yuan members Yu Peihou, Ni Bi, and others. It was found that the funds were allocated to the China Industrial Bank and then distributed to several banks and money houses. The two members, Yu and Ni, formally filed an impeachment and submitted it to the nine-member review committee on the afternoon of the 15th for review and establishment. The allocated funds were also requested by the Control Yuan to Acting President Li to order the Executive Yuan to recover them.

As for the overall plan for peace talks, he will follow the orders of the central government. Moreover, Sichuan is making every effort to maintain stability and can quell the unrest. Regarding the number of troops in Sichuan, the provincial government has decided at a meeting to reduce the total quota by two-thirds, and Sichuan grain will continue to be shipped east as usual.

### Legislative Yuan Passes Third Reading, Streamlining Administrative Organizations, Amending Articles 3 and 5 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law, Cutting and Merging Eight Ministries, One Commission, and One Bureau

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] On the day that the newly appointed President of the Executive Yuan, He Yingqin, arrived in Beijing to officially begin forming his cabinet, the Legislative Yuan quickly and smoothly passed the third reading of the plan to streamline administrative organizations, amending Articles 3 and 5 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law. With a bold and decisive approach, eight ministries, one commission, and one bureau were cut and merged, reducing the number of ministries and commissions under the Executive Yuan by nearly one-half. The reason why the plan was quickly passed was to cooperate with the political reforms advocated by Acting President Li, so that Mr. He Yingqin could organize the cabinet according to the new organization law. The amended Executive Yuan Organization Law retains only the eight ministries of Interior, Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Finance, Education, Judicial Administration, Economy, and Transportation, the two commissions of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs and Overseas Chinese Affairs, and one directorate of Accounting. The four ministries and commissions of Agriculture and Forestry, Water Conservancy, Industry and Commerce, and Resources are merged into the Ministry of Economy. The Ministry of Food is changed to the Food and Grain Administration, which is subordinate to the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Social Affairs is abolished, and the Social Affairs Department is established in the Ministry of Interior to manage social administration. The Ministry of Budget and Accounting is changed to the Directorate of Accounting, which is subordinate to the Executive Yuan. As for the new cabinet bureau, it will be abolished. In the future, there will be only ten ministers兼任部會者in the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Committee, and seven not兼部會者, together with the President and Vice President, a total of 19 people, will form the Political Affairs Conference, which will be responsible for the planning and promotion of national political affairs. The Legislative Yuan's meeting on the 15th spent almost all of the morning and afternoon discussing the plan. During the meeting, there were several heated debates and repeated discussions and votes before a conclusion was reached. The original plan was proposed by Legislative Yuan member Chen Guyuan and others, and only Article 3 was amended. The review opinion was that the News Bureau and the proposed裁改of the Directorate of Accounting, the Labor Bureau, and the Resources Bureau involved Article 5, so Article 5 was amended accordingly. When the meeting opened on the morning of the 15th, the Procedure Committee suggested that the plan should be discussed in advance in order to meet the needs. Chairman Tong Guanxian obtained the consent of the members and announced the review opinions for discussion. The members spoke one after another, expressing their support for the principle of simplifying administrative organizations. However, there were different opinions on which organizations should be cut and merged and which should be retained. Some advocated retaining the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, some advocated changing the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, which would be subordinate to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, some opposed abolishing the Ministry of Land Administration, and some advocated merging Agriculture and Forestry and Industry and Commerce into the Ministry of Economy. A member proposed that in order to facilitate the discussion, the review opinions should be decided one by one. The proposal was adopted by the meeting, and the discussion began department by department. There was no objection to the five departments that should be retained: Interior, Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Finance, and Education. When discussing the Ministry of Judicial Administration, some people advocated that the Ministry of Judicial Administration should be returned to the Judicial Yuan and that it was not necessary to establish a ministry. However, due to the provisions of the Constitution, the opinion was rejected. When discussing the merger of the two ministries of Agriculture and Forestry and Water Conservancy into the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy, some members advocated that it should be truly simplified and that the four ministries and commissions of Agriculture and Forestry, Water Conservancy, Industry and Commerce, and Resources could be merged into the Ministry of Economy. Those who advocated retaining the name of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry strongly opposed it, and after a long debate, the majority passed the merger of the four departments into the Ministry of Economy. Continuing the discussion of the Ministry of Transportation and the two commissions of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs and Overseas Chinese Affairs, there were no major objections. Some people advocated that the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission could be changed to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Department of the Ministry of Interior, but the number of co-signers was insufficient, and the amendment was not established. Both were passed according to the review opinions. When discussing the departments that should be cut and merged, the review opinion of "abolishing the Ministry of Social Affairs and establishing a Labor Bureau directly under the Executive Yuan for labor affairs" was passed. However, after the second讚通過of the entire plan, this decision was rejected by a member. After another vote, it was changed to "abolishing the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the social administration will be handled by the Social Affairs Department established by the Ministry of Interior, and its affiliated organs will be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Interior." The Ministry of Land Administration was changed to the Land Administration Bureau, and the Ministry of Health was changed to the Health Administration Bureau, both subordinate to the Ministry of Interior. There was only a slight discussion before they were passed. The Ministry of Food was changed to the Food and Grain Administration, which was subordinate to the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Budget and Accounting was changed to the Directorate of Accounting, which was subordinate to the Executive Yuan, and there was no objection to任意球新聞避兩議. A member strongly argued that the Resources Commission should not be merged into the Ministry of Economy, but the case had already been decided and could not be changed. After the discussion of each department was completed, someone proposed that in addition to the abolished and merged departments, the remaining departments should also be streamlined as much as possible, and all organization laws should be amended as soon as possible. The proposal was approved by a majority of the members. As for the abolished organs, their original business was also decided to be assigned to the relevant organs for handling according to their nature and included in the resolution. The chairman then ordered the amended text to be read and sought the consent of the members, omitting the third reading procedure. The amendment to Articles 3 and 5 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law was completed.

The revised articles are as follows:

Article 3 The Executive Yuan shall establish the following ministries, commissions:

(1) Ministry of Interior
(2) Ministry of Foreign Affairs
(3) Ministry of National Defense
(4) Ministry of Finance
( 
5 )Ministry Of Educatiom
(6) Ministry of Judicial Administration
(7) Ministry of Economy
(8) Ministry of Transportation
(9) Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission
(10) Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission

The organization of each ministry and commission shall be determined by law.

Article 5 The Executive Yuan shall establish a Directorate of Accounting, the organization of which shall be determined by law.

### Review of the Proposal to Stop the徴兵徵糧, Decided to Report to the 22nd Council Meeting, Changed the Motion to Stop the Price Increase of Transportation Enterprises to a Questioning Motion

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] The fifth meeting of the Third Committee of the Legislative Yuan was held on the 15th. The meeting opened at 9:30 in the morning with 178 people in attendance. Chairman Tong Guanxian announced the minutes of the previous meeting. The Procedure Committee presented several reports. Regarding the review of the proposal to quickly stop征兵 and 徵糧 proposed by Huang Tong and others, it was decided that five members from each of the Internal Affairs and Local Self-Defense Committee, the National Defense Committee, and the Food Administration Committee would conduct the review and submit a report to the 22nd Council meeting. The emergency motion proposed by Niu Jianchu and others to stop the price increase of transportation enterprises, which the Executive Yuan had not yet implemented, was decided to be changed to a questioning motion, and the Minister of Transportation was immediately notified to attend the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 18th to be questioned. Regarding the peace opinion, it had been proposed and voted on at the previous meeting. Due to doubts about the number of people present, it was proposed again for a re-vote, which was unanimously approved by the whole meeting. The review report on the amendment to Article 3 of the Executive Yuan Organization Law to simplify administrative organizations was continued. The members spoke a lot without reaching a conclusion. The meeting adjourned at 12:00. The meeting continued at 3:50 in the afternoon, and the members still spoke on the simplification of administrative organizations until it was completed at 5:50. Finally, the Executive Yuan's proposal to abolish the higher special criminal courts throughout the country and to amend the Special Criminal Court Organization Law, the Special Criminal Court Trial Law, and the Emergency Punishment Regulations for Harming the State during the Period of Suppression of Rebellion was discussed and decided to be abolished. Other cases were left for discussion at the next meeting due to lack of time. The meeting adjourned at 6:00.

### The Proposal for Military Reorganization Is Included in the Agenda of the Next Meeting

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] The Legislative Yuan Procedure Committee held a meeting at 6:00 PM on the 15th to discuss the agenda of the next Yuan meeting.

### The US President Is Watching the Evolution of the Situation in China

[Central News Agency Washington, 14th] The White House and the State Department remain silent on General He Yingqin's appointment to form a cabinet. In Congress, the call for the United States to adopt a more active China policy in support of aid to China is rising, but formal discussions on the China issue have yet to begin. As for the temporary aid to China plan from April 3 to June 31, it will be approved soon. White House officials said that President Truman is closely watching the evolution of the situation in China and is very concerned about the political situation in Nanjing. He apparently regularly receives classified reports on China, which are studied by the National Security Council under his leadership, but no decision has yet been made. What is of most concern to the United States policy makers is still the outcome of the KMT-CPC peace talks. It is generally recognized that the Chinese crisis is a very important issue for the United States.

### The Control Yuan Secretly Reviews Conference Rooms to Strengthen the Exercise of Supervisory Power, Consults the Legislative Yuan to Amend the Relevant Articles on Impeachment Cases to Cooperate with Public Opinion to Sanction Corrupt Officials

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] The Control Yuan is seeking to strengthen the exercise of its supervisory power. At the closed-door meeting on the 15th to review work reports, it was resolved to consult the Legislative Yuan to amend Article 13 of the Supervisory Law, which is unreasonable and affects the exercise of impeachment power. The original article stipulated that "Control Yuan personnel shall not disclose impeachment cases to the outside world before the disciplinary authorities have deliberated and disposed of them." According to the provisions of this article, the impeachment cases filed by the Control Yuan in the past could not be announced to the public due to the restrictions of this article, and the impeached corrupt officials who violated laws and regulations did not receive any sanctions from public opinion. When reviewing the past work of the Control Yuan at the meeting on the 15th, the members expressed indignation that the disciplinary authorities had not transferred any of the 45 impeachment cases filed last year for disciplinary action. They believed that according to Article 17 of the Supervisory Law, "If the disciplinary authorities have not handled the impeachment case for more than three months, the Control Yuan may question them," they should be questioned and the heads of the disciplinary authorities should be invited to attend the general meeting to report, and it was advocated that public opinion should be used to sanction corrupt officials in order to cooperate with the exercise of supervisory power. Regarding the amendment of Article 13 of the Supervisory Law, it will be proposed orally by the Supervisory Committee at the joint meeting of the Legislative and Supervisory Committee members on the 20th. After the Supervisory Committee's Regulations Group is established, the amendment will be formally drafted and consulted with the Legislative Yuan for amendment, so as to ensure that impeachment cases are formally announced after review and establishment in the future, so that those who embezzle and pervert the law are subject to sanctions by public opinion. Those who spoke at the meeting on the 15th were very enthusiastic. Liu Pingjiang also advocated that the Disciplinary Committee should be under the command of the Control Yuan. In the afternoon, the organization was passed: (1) the Opinions Collating Group for Business Review, (2) the Regulatory Law Meeting Research Group, and (3) the Political Review Research Group. Each group elected nine members to conduct research.

[Central News Agency Guangzhou, 15th] Supervisory Committee member Yuan Qinghui stated that the Executive Yuan had not yet implemented the punishment for Song Ziwen and others for套購 Hong Kong dollars. Recently, he sent a special letter to the President urging the Executive Yuan to expedite the handling of the matter, stating in the letter: "National principles must be maintained, and the supervisory powers should be贯澈." He also said: "There are also private individuals who took advantage of the opportunity to 落湯落利from the foreign exchange, which has been verified by the Guangdong and Guangxi Administrative Office and evidence is on file. However, the Administrative Office has been putting it aside for a long time and delaying the handling of the matter, which is very wrong. It is proposed that the Guangdong and Guangxi Administrative Office be ordered to submit the evidence to the Yuan as soon as possible for verification."

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 15th] The candidates for the Examination Committee and the Grand Justices were previously nominated by the President and requested the approval of the Control Yuan. However, the number of those who agreed was still insufficient to reach the legal quorum. In order for the Examination Committee and the Grand Justices Conference to be held legally, Acting President Li has decided to resubmit several members of the Examination Committee and the Grand Justices and consult the Control Yuan for approval at this year's annual meeting. The heads of the various administrative offices and committees of the Control Yuan will also be re-elected at this year's annual meeting.

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 15th] Since the opening of the Control Yuan meeting on the 12th, Supervisory Committee members from various regions have arrived in Beijing to report on their duties, including Zhang Yunzhen, Hou Jun, Zhang Xuanzhong, Hu Fuxian, Zhang Jun, Wang Xuan, and Xing Senzhou, a total of seven people. Including the previous ones, there are a total of one hundred and one people.

### British Parliamentarians Question the Whereabouts of the Chongqing Ship

[Agence France-Presse London, 14th] During questioning in the British House of Commons today, the issue of the whereabouts of the Chinese cruiser "Chongqing," formerly the British ship "Dawn," was mentioned. Conservative MP Lang Erfan asked the Foreign Secretary if he could make a statement on the cruiser, which the British government handed over to the National Government in May 1948. Undersecretary of State McNeil replied on behalf of the Foreign Secretary: "Chongqing" has recently fled to the CCP area. According to reports, the ship first sailed to Yantai, a CCP-controlled seaport, and then sailed to Dalian. This news has not been confirmed.

[Reuters Nanjing, 15th] Navy Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing recently confirmed that the cruiser Chongqing is near the port of Dalian. He denied the claim that the ship had been bombed and sunk, saying that the naval authorities had no intention of bombing and sinking the ship.

Upon disembarking, his daughter-in-law rushed forward to embrace him warmly, causing Mr. Zhang to blush. He then greeted each of the welcomers individually, and was escorted by Director Yu, Chairman Xue, and others to the Yingbin Hotel for rest. Mr. Zhang told reporters at the airport that he had visited Guangzhou in 1918 and 1927. It had been over a decade since his last visit, so the primary purpose of this trip was to revisit old haunts. Secondly, there were certain political matters in the Southwest that required discussion. He would also take care of some family matters incidentally and would return to Chongqing in a few days. Wu Tiecheng responded to reporters' questions stating: (1) Sun Ke would return to Guangzhou in about a week. (2) Although the cabinet had changed, it would not affect the peace talks. One or two government representatives had resigned, but suitable replacements had already been found. (3) He Yingqin had invited him to participate in [some matter], and he had agreed to help. (4) There was a consensus within the government against stagnation, and naturally a "glorious peace" was desired. (5) The Communist side could propose eight conditions, and we could also propose eight conditions. (6) We cannot guarantee that the Communist army will not cross the Yangtze River, but the government will continue to strive for peace as before.

### Editorial: Rescuing the Economic Crisis

—The Third of Our Hopes for Premier He—

The cost of living index for workers in this city for the first half of March was released yesterday by the city government, and it is 1339.36 times that of "August 1937." This presents a serious challenge for factories in terms of raising the large amounts of cash needed to pay workers' salaries for the first half of March. We see that many factories today, under the exploitation and torment of high-interest policies and other difficulties, have already been reduced to a desperate situation where they "cannot survive, and cannot close down." Now, they are further threatened by the high cost of living index. If the authorities continue to disregard the consequences, I fear that within one or two months, 70-80% of all factories in Shanghai will declare a shutdown or bankruptcy! If factories close en masse and unemployment rises sharply, such an economic crisis is something we cannot afford to ignore. The situation in Shanghai is likely to affect other places as well.

Before going to Nanjing yesterday, Premier He repeatedly convened meetings with financial giants in this city, expressing that the most difficult issues for the new cabinet, apart from peace talks, were financial and economic problems. We certainly hope that Premier He's new cabinet will have a good plan to rescue the economic crisis.

Our economic crisis did not start today. Its seeds were sown in the later stages of the War of Resistance, but the harm was not yet great. After the victory, policies of dumping gold and official exchange rates were adopted, hoping to stabilize prices during that period, but the nine hundred million US dollars of assets stored in the national treasury were thus wasted. After the foreign exchange rate adopted a floating rate, prices and foreign exchange rates spiraled upwards, like wild horses. Then came the reckless policy of currency reform by Finance Minister Wang Yunwu in the Weng Wenhao cabinet, which took all the gold, silver, and foreign currency stored by the people below the middle class and placed it in the national treasury. "When wealth is gathered by the state, the people are scattered," and the overall situation declined like a river flowing downhill. The biggest shortcoming of past financial and economic policies was that they never made a firm decision to effectively make those who are truly rich pay as much as possible. Until recently, the financial and monetary reform plan presided over by Finance Minister Xu Kan of the Sun Ke cabinet was introduced and made some reforms to reality. While it could not be compared to the measures of Finance Minister Wang, it still lacked the most important link, namely: it did not affect the wealthy in the slightest. As a result, the sweeping measures may instead stifle the livelihoods of ordinary industrial and commercial enterprises and ordinary people.

Let's start with the recent cost of living index. The first half of February rose nearly eight times compared to the second half of January, the second half of February rose nearly double compared to the first half of February, and the first half of March rose more than double again compared to the second half of February. Except for the first half of February, which jumped seven or eight times due to the special Lunar New Year's holiday, the price increase was doubled every half a month. Assuming this speed remains unchanged, the cost of living index will be four times that of the previous month. How can prices not rise sharply? Moreover, in addition to wages, industrial and commercial operators must bear excessively high interest rates. Last week, the average interest rate in the market was six or seven cents per day for call loans, and borrowers had to pay interest on the principal after eight or nine days. If you calculate the cost at this high-interest rate, the price of goods can rise by seven or eight times a month. This will only enrich the wealthy even more, while making it impossible for ordinary industrialists, businessmen, and small operators to maintain their businesses. As for ordinary civil servants and civilians who rely solely on wages, their haggard moans are beyond description!

The current authorities want to use the policy of tightening credit to stabilize prices. However, after the Central Bank used the means of dumping gold, silver, and foreign exchange certificates to tighten credit, the price of gold remained hovering between 3 million and 3.5 million, which dealt a considerable blow to speculators who were only raising the price of gold. But the question remains as to how much this can suppress prices. In all fairness, this kind of dumping policy, from a good perspective, is commendable in the following points: (1) The Central Bank first sells gold, silver, and foreign exchange at high prices, and then buys them back at appropriate low prices, so the Central Bank is not only not harmed but also has a profit to make. The government can be called an invincible big player in the speculative market, and there is no place where it is not profitable. (2) In the past, the price increase was led by financial commodities. Now that the price of financial commodities has been stabilized by seizing the kingpin, the prices of other commodities will not rise day by day. (3) The Shanghai market was originally a speculative market, manipulated by a few major players. These major players are nothing less than vampires sucking the blood of the people. The government should crack down on them to force them to surrender. But on the other hand, there are also many serious problems: (1) This policy is reliable but not sustainable, and it will certainly not prevent price increases. At most, it will only make prices rise in an orderly manner, and the increase of doubling every half a month has almost become a law. (2) Although this policy strikes speculators, it also hurts legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises. The high-interest policy that results from this can make the cost of goods twice as high every half a month, which is enough to abuse legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises. If the factories depreciate and cut off the finished products, the sales are very weak, and even if they are sold, the proceeds are not enough to reproduce. Under such circumstances, in the end, they can only go down the road of "closing the door." (3) If it only rises by one time every half a month, will the price of rice around the Dragon Boat Festival not rise to 19 million per stone? Moreover, if one day the Central Bank cannot control the market, the price increase will run wild and be out of control, and the small people will feel more and more unable to make a living!

From the above discussion, we can see that the most urgent problem facing the new cabinet is how to rescue the economic crisis to reduce the threat to people's lives. The reform plan of the Sun Ke cabinet is still not enough. It must be known that peace talks are important, but if the people in the government-controlled area are all unable to live under the pressure of high prices, high-interest rates, and high wages, will the government still be qualified and capable of talking about equal peace? Peace talks must have capital. Only the stable mood of the people's lives and the psychology of loving and supporting the government are the capital for the government to engage in peace talks. So how can the economic crisis be rescued? This certainly requires the research of some experts, and the most important thing to strive for is to make the wealthy pay. Taking from the wealthy and using it for the common people can win people's hearts and give a fresh look; because only in this way can it be in line with the golden rule of "when wealth is distributed, the people gather." In a nutshell, if the government's economic plans and financial and economic reform plans still refuse to recognize reality and treat this root cause today, it will be in vain.

### The Situation in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River Tightens; Seven Columns of the Communist Army in Central China Move South; The National Army in Eastern Hubei Also Completes New Deployments

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] At present, as the 19 columns of Chen Yi's East China Field Army approach the northern bank of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu and Anhui, about seven columns of the Central Plains Field Army led by Liu Bocheng and Chen Geng, which have completed reorganization after the Battle of Shuangduiji, are advancing from the Yellow River flood area in eastern Henan towards the Xinyang section of the Pinghan Railway and the Macheng-Huangpi area on the northern bank of the Yangtze River east of Wuhan. The 1st Column departed from Xiangcheng and arrived in Guangshan on the 9th. The 1,000-man Xiong Zuofang unit of the 2nd Military Sub-district of the Central Plains also traveled south with this column. The 2nd and 3rd Columns marched towards Gushi from the Fuyang area, accompanied by 2,000 men from the 1st Military Sub-district, led by Lei Shaokang. The 4th Column departed from Taihe, Anhui, and arrived in Huangchuan on the 12th. The 6th Column moved towards Lu'an from Mengcheng. The 9th Column departed from Xiangcheng and arrived in Zhengyang on the 12th. The 11th Column arrived at Xincai from Jieshou and is transporting supplies towards Zhengyang. Based on the observed movements of these seven columns, totaling about 100,000 Communist troops, it is clear that the two Communist armies that arrived in Zhengyang and crossed Huangchuan towards Luoshan aim for Xinyang. The four columns that arrived in Lu'an, Gushi, and Guangshan are likely to cross the tail of the Dabie Mountains and enter the northern bank of the Yangtze River in eastern Hubei to coordinate with Chen Yi's movement near the river bank, forming a posture to cut off the Wu head and Chu tail. Currently, there are only minor skirmishes at the vanguard of the Communist army. The military is paying close attention to its development.

[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 15th Dispatch] More than 10,000 troops from Liu Bocheng's army, heading south along the Xin (cai) Huang (chuan) highway on the east side of Pinghan, crossed the Houpi River (90 li south of Huangchuan) in Guangshan County on the 14th and arrived in Macheng County, eastern Hubei, only 70 li from the forward positions of the National Army reinforcements in eastern Hubei. (2) The thousand-plus Communist troops on the southern bank of the Huai River between Huangchuan and Luoshan retreated north on the 14th, and order was restored in Luoshan. (3) The Communist army stationed northeast of Zhumadian has been frequently mobilized recently. It is reported that 30,000 National Army troops who surrendered during the Xuzhou-Bengbu campaign have been reorganized into a corps under the command of Chen Geng. The unit has three military designations: 12th, 13th, and 14th. Communist cadres account for about two-thirds of the unit. (4) It is reported that two more columns of the Communist army in the southeast will continue to move south. Part of the grain from Guangshan, Huangchuan, Gushi, Xixian, and Shangcheng, the granaries of southern Henan, is being moved south from Xincai. This is another indication of the Communist army's active preparations for crossing the Yangtze River in the middle reaches.

[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 15th Dispatch] The National Army has completed new deployments on the line of Wuxue, Qichun, and Guangji in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. A powerful corps has arrived in eastern Hubei.

[Our Newspaper, Xinyang, 15th Dispatch] Military News: (1) The National Army has increased its defenses in the eastern part of Henan, and Zhengyang, 90 li east of the isolated county of Zhumadian, has been turned from danger to safety thanks to the arrival of the "3677" unit of the National Army. (2) Chen Geng's newly formed 4th Corps began to move southeast along the Pinghan Road from Luohe via Runan on the 14th. According to a telegram from Luoshan, more than 2,000 Communist troops moving south crossed the Huai River for the second time on the 15th, and the city has strengthened its defenses.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Military News: At 8 PM on the 13th, Communist army small motorboats were discovered towing a small number of wooden boats attempting to navigate the river surface near Heishazhou on the northern bank of the Yangtze River opposite Digang, west of Wuhu. They turned northeast and fled after being fired upon by the garrison on the southern bank.

### Lin Biao's Troops Actively Move South; Large Numbers of Communist Troops Arrive in Jingjiang Again

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] Military personnel who arrived in Qingdao on the 13th stated that when they traveled south from Dezhou on the 8th, they passed by the southward-moving troops of Lin Biao for a depth of about seven to eight kilometers. They counted about 150 mountain guns and 350 field guns. Military news also reported that four columns of Lin Biao's troops—the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th—were moving south between Tengxian and Xuzhou. The weather was clear on the 15th, and air force transport planes and reconnaissance planes discovered Communist army troops moving south on the Siying, Sishui, Jieshou, and Gaoyou highway lines in northern Jiangsu, numbering over 10,000. As Chen Yi's troops have already approached the northern banks of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu and Anhui, the above-mentioned marching troops are undoubtedly the Communist side's second-line reinforcements.

[Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 15th Dispatch] The 10th, 12th, and 13th Columns of the Communist army have arrived in Jingjiang, increasing the pressure on the National Army's positions at Bawugang, but there has been no contact. There are more than 2,000 wooden boats in Rugao, Tianshenggang, Yong'ansha, and surrounding areas, attempting to cross the river to the Jinjigang Changyinsha area on the southern bank. Small groups of local Communists have been discovered in the area, and the garrison is searching and suppressing them.

[Our Newspaper, Changshu, 15th Dispatch] Heavy troops are stationed in Changyinsha Jinjigang and other places on the border between Yu and Cheng, and full preparations have been made to stabilize the people's hearts.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 15th Dispatch] A telegram from Zhenjiang stated that the Communist army attacked the National Army's positions three miles east of Yiwei on the northern bank of the Yangtze River, and the fighting continued until this morning. The telegram also stated that a Communist army sailboat attempted to cross the river from the northern bank to near Zhenjiang this morning but was discovered by the National Army and sunk by artillery fire, killing all ten people on board.

[Our Newspaper, Changshu, 15th Dispatch] The Ministry of National Defense attaches great importance to the defense along the Yangtze River from Nanjing to Shanghai.

### Taiwan Province Plans to Experiment with British-Style Socialism

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 15th Dispatch] Taiwan has experimented with Japanese and American administrative systems in the three years since its restoration. Since Chen Cheng took over the provincial administration of Taiwan, he has also planned to use the province as a place to experiment with the British-style socialist system. Mr. Chen is currently planning to implement the British full rationing system in Taiwan and has recruited many scholars who have returned from studying in the UK to plan this matter for the Taiwan Provincial Government. Mr. Chen himself admires British socialism very much and has written books on socialism. The success or failure of Mr. Chen's socialist administration in Taiwan depends on whether he can enable Taiwan Province to directly engage in foreign trade. Currently, the foreign trade of various provinces is handled by the central authorities, and what Taiwan gets is not foreign exchange but gold yuan. In addition, whether the local residents can cooperate with Mr. Chen is also the main factor for the success of the experimental socialist system. Taiwan was ruled by Japan for fifty years. After the restoration, the Chinese authorities supported the war at home with Taiwan's resources. At the beginning of Chen Yi's term, he took over the major industries and monopoly enterprises in Taiwan Province and put people from other provinces in charge of the institutions, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the Taiwanese people. After Wei Daoming took office, he implemented the American system and contacted the prestigious people of Taiwan Province to use them as intermediaries between the government and the Taiwanese people. However, these wealthy Taiwanese households also had little contact with the people and took advantage of their relationship with Mr. Wei to pursue their own personal interests. Until January of this year, due to the dramatic changes in the domestic situation, the central government appointed Chen Cheng as the chairman of Taiwan Province. How effective Mr. Chen's promotion of socialism will be remains to be proven by facts.

### British Colonial Undersecretary and Australian Authorities Review South Pacific Defense to Protect the Security of the British Empire

[Reuters, Canberra, 15th] Authoritative sources revealed that British Undersecretary for Development, Lord Listowel, attended the Australian Cabinet meeting today and gave a speech, expressing that Britain welcomes any suggestions to improve the security of the British Empire in the Pacific. Li also emphasized that due to the expansion of communism in Southeast Asia, it is necessary to strengthen defense arrangements in the Pacific. It is noted that Li is here as a special envoy of Prime Minister Attlee to discuss various issues related to the British Commonwealth with the Australian and New Zealand governments. Other British government officials on similar missions to the British Commonwealth include Mr. Wagg, Undersecretary of the Commonwealth Relations Department, going to India, Palestine, and Ceylon; Mr. Lee, another Undersecretary from the same department, going to South Africa; and Mr. Burke, Cabinet Secretary, going to Canada. Li will discuss the defense of the South Pacific region in detail with Australian Minister of Defense Dedman tonight.

[Associated Press, Canberra, 14th] Joint defense talks between Britain, New Zealand, and Australia opened here today.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] Sources close to the British Foreign Office claim that rumors about the start of talks on a Pacific Pact are premature. According to semi-official British views, discussions on a Pacific Pact can only begin after the Atlantic Pact has been finalized. Those close to British Foreign Secretary Bevin are increasingly aware that it is now imperative to organize strong democratic powers in the Far East and pay attention to their policies in order to align with the Western powers' concern for maintaining peace in that part of the world. It will still take time to address any developments in these countries using established methods.

[Reuters, The Hague, 15th] Political figures here stated that it is too early to discuss a Pacific regional defense pact until the political difficulties in Indonesia are resolved. To date, the Dutch government has not received any official information regarding the establishment of such a defense pact.

### Second Day of the Five-Nation Western European Conference; Discussing the Distribution of American Military Supplies; The Charter of the European Parliament is Also Under Discussion

[Associated Press, London, 15th] The five-nation conference discussing European defense on the 15th discussed how the weapons supplied by the United States should be distributed among the Atlantic Pact countries. The foreign ministers, defense ministers, and finance ministers of Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg also discussed the final plan for the preparatory meeting of the European Parliament. After the conclusion of the two-day closed-door meeting, a communiqué is expected to be issued on the evening of the 15th. It is reported that today's meeting discussed whether the five Western European countries should accept American weapons collectively or whether each country should negotiate with the United States separately on this matter.

[Associated Press, London, 15th] The conference of foreign ministers of the five Western European allies entered its second day today, continuing discussions on the North Atlantic Joint Defense Treaty and the charter of the European Consultative Assembly. Because the five countries, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, have invited Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, and Italy to attend the inaugural meeting of the European Consultative Assembly to be held in London on the 28th of this month, and the foreign ministers of the five countries also intend to go to Washington to participate in the signing ceremony of the North Atlantic Treaty, a conflict arises in terms of time. It is expected that the meeting of the foreign ministers of the five countries will inevitably decide to postpone the London meeting or have the ambassadors of each country represent the foreign ministers. The details of the meetings of the past two days are being kept strictly confidential by the authorities and will only be announced after the conclusion, but most of the resolutions related to joint defense are not included in this case, and only the economic issues caused by the North Atlantic Treaty will be announced.

### Closing of the Supreme Soviet Assembly; Continued Changes in Government Personnel; Dismissal of the Chairman of the State Planning Committee Worthy of Attention

[Associated Press, Moscow, 14th] The Supreme Soviet Assembly passed the general budget for this year tonight, stipulating defense spending of 79 billion rubles, and then announced its closure.

[Reuters, Moscow, 14th] Three Soviet government officials were dismissed today by order of the Supreme Soviet. One was Nikolai Voznesensky, Chairman of the State Planning Committee and Deputy Prime Minister, whose vacancy was filled by Deputy Prime Minister Saburov. In addition, Supreme Court President Golyakov was also dismissed and replaced by Volin. Finally, Bobokov, a member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, was dismissed and replaced by Mikhailovich.

It is noted that Voznesensky first emerged after the purges of Soviet defendants before the war. When he served in the Leningrad Planning Committee in 1934, he may have been a confidant of Soviet Communist Party figure Zhdanov.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 14th] Although the reasons for the personnel changes in the Soviet Cabinet were not explained, they are clearly part of a comprehensive reorganization plan for the government. In addition, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet announced the merging of the Ministry of Construction, the Ministry of Construction, Naval Enterprises, and the Ministry of Machine Industry into the Ministry of Construction and Machine Industry, headed by Taigayev, the former Minister of Construction.

[Reuters, London, 14th] Observers here believe that the dismissal of Voznesensky, Chairman of the Soviet State Planning Committee, may indicate that Soviet leaders are reconsidering the ideological basis of Soviet foreign policy. Whether this speculation is correct can be determined by whether Voznesensky still retains his position as a member of the Communist Party Politburo. Observers here also point out that when Molotov and Mikoyan were dismissed from their positions as Foreign Minister and Minister of Foreign Trade, respectively, at the beginning of the month, they still retained their positions as Deputy Prime Ministers, but Voznesensky is not the same; even the position of Deputy Prime Minister has been removed. However, his position as a member of the Politburo may be retained. If so, his dismissal as Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Planning Committee may mean that he will focus on the work of the Eastern European Economic Assistance Committee. One theory is that Voznesensky's dismissal as Chairman of the State Planning Committee is due to the fact that Soviet leaders' ideological beliefs about their relations with Western countries have been shaken. Over the past year, after the famous Soviet economist Varga published a new theory that Western countries may achieve socio-economic liberation through reform rather than revolution, it caused controversy among Soviet leaders. Voznesensky was one of the most vocal opponents of Varga's views, so this time Voznesensky's dismissal may indicate that Soviet leaders have begun to re-examine the ideology on which their foreign policy is based.

It is noted that the Dutch Foreign Minister is in England to attend the meeting of foreign ministers of the Western European Union countries.

### Telephone Company Loses Net $360,000 in One Year

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Telephone Company held its annual shareholders meeting on the 14th, with Vice President Fallenly reporting on the company's business operations for the past year. It was stated that the company's operations were affected by inflation, and the increase in telephone fees failed to increase proportionally, resulting in a net loss of US$363,378 in revenue minus expenses for the past year.

The Custody Committee of the Post-War Rehabilitation Affairs Committee stated that recently, the materials stored in the affiliated institutions of the committee have often been requisitioned for military use. It has recently requested the Post-War Rehabilitation Affairs Committee to submit a report to the Executive Yuan for immediate prohibition.

### Upper Period Worker Living Index for This Month Announced by Review Committee - Over 1339 Times

The fixed base period index is 1339.3552 times, and the chain relative index is 2.08 times. The Shanghai Municipal Worker's Cost of Living Index Compilation Review Committee held a meeting yesterday morning, chaired by Chu Yifei, the statistical director of the city government. Cao Peizi, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Shen Ding, Ju Xuexiang of the General Labor Union, Liang Yongzhang, Sun Wenyuan, Yan Esheng of the City Chamber of Commerce, Jin Runxiang of the Industrial Association, Tian Heqing, and others attended. First, the chairman reported that a total of five surveys were conducted for this period. General price fluctuations were minimal in the first three surveys, and the index was not much different from the previous period's index. Fluctuations only occurred in the last two periods. Therefore, the total average of the worker's cost of living index for this period increased by more than one time compared to the previous period. Finally, the members signed the index form, which was then announced. The total worker's cost of living index for the upper period of March is recorded as follows:

(1) "Fixed Base Period Index" Taking the upper half of January of the 38th year of the Republic (48.04 times) as the base period, the total index and classification index are as follows:

### Two Proposals from the General Labor Union Sparked Debate in the Review Committee

[Reported by this newspaper] The living index for this period was delayed until 12:45 yesterday before being released by the city government, more than two hours later than usual. Moreover, the released index of 1339 times was lower than generally expected, which aroused suspicion from all walks of life, and various rumors followed. At around 11:00, it was once rumored that the index had been determined to be 1642 times. Some factories and firms, without careful consideration, actually paid wages based on 1642 times. In order to understand the truth, the reporter visited relevant people to inquire about the situation in the index review committee and the source of the "1642" rumor. It is understood that yesterday's meeting began at 10:30. First, Chu Yifei, the statistical director of the city government, reported the calculation results of the chain relative index and the fixed index. The old index was 1336 times, while the new calculation by the City General Labor Union was 1339 times (also based on the city government's compilation formula). The two were not much different. Zhou Xuexiang, chairman of the General Labor Union, believed that prices are rising in an orderly manner every day, and the increase in half a month is more than one time. It is impossible for the working class to use the average price in this half month to cope with the current real life. Therefore, he put forward two suggestions: (1) The current index compilation surveys prices five times. The first time is on the first day of the period. At that time, the price was not much different from the last price in the previous period's index. If added to the calculation, it would have a great impact on the index and should be cancelled, and only the average of the subsequent four times should be calculated. (2) The rice price in the index should be calculated entirely based on the market price (currently, the compilation is based on half the market price and half the ration price). However, these two suggestions were immediately opposed by representatives of the industrial sector, which sparked a heated debate between the two sides. Although the city government favored 1339 times, representatives of the General Labor Union still refused to sign, and the situation was deadlocked for a long time. Because if Zhou Xuexiang's two proposals could be adopted, the index for this period would be more than 1500 times, which is more than 200 times different from what was released yesterday. Later, after repeated explanations by Cao, the director of the City Social Affairs Bureau, and the promise that the index compilation method for the next period could be discussed at length, he strongly persuaded the representatives of the General Labor Union to sign. This "1339" index was then born. The rumor of "1642" is the index proposed by the General Labor Union, which the General Labor Union strongly denied, but said: "I have also heard this saying, but I don't know where it came from."

### Police Department's Handling of Labor Disputes - General Labor Union Believes It Is Unfair

Zhou Xuexiang and Others to Petition Today

The City General Labor Union believes that the provision in the various measures for handling labor disputes recently promulgated by the Garrison Headquarters, which stipulates that union directors and officers are jointly responsible for the occurrence of labor disputes, is unfair. Furthermore, since the sealing of steel smelting products, more than 8,000 workers have been cut off from their livelihoods. In order to seek relief from the authorities, Chairman Zhou Xuexiang will lead the directors and supervisors to the City Government, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and the Social Affairs Bureau to petition at 10:00 AM today.

### Yu Wenhua, an Employee of the Police Pictorial Office, is Accused of Embezzlement

[Reported by this newspaper] Yu Wenhua, who forged the seal of the Police Pictorial Office and falsely collected advertising fees, was sentenced to two months of imprisonment by the District Court yesterday, with a fine of 100 yuan. If he chooses to perform labor service, it will be calculated at 3 yuan per day. It is reported that on July 16th of last year, Yu was hired by Luo Zhenzi, the president of the Nanjing Police Pictorial Office, as the director of the advertising department of the Shanghai branch. It was agreed that all documents required for advertising business should be signed by Luo for supervision. However, on October 27th of last year, Yu privately carved two seals of the office and forged the office's receipts, receiving a total of 300 yuan in advertising fees paid by the American-owned Jijiang Tobacco Company. Also, when settling accounts with Luo on the 27th of the same month, he issued a blank check. Luo was unable to cash the check and investigated the previous situation, so he reported it to the police, who transferred it to the District Court for trial and sentencing.

### Sudden Threatening Letter - Businessman Seeks Protection - Famous "Thin Knife Gang" Arrested on Kangti Road

The concubine, Peng Meiying, 25 years old, from Nantong, is "Bai Ping," who used to be a dancer at the Gao Shimang Dance Hall. As early as seven years ago, Wang ventured into the dance hall, fell in love at first sight, and soon discussed marriage, keeping her as a mistress. Initially, they lived with the main wife at No. 11, Zhaojia Zhai, Damuqiao, Nanshi. Recently, they moved to No. 62, Wanyi Fang, Chongqing South Road. On the 12th, Lu Liqun, the general manager of the company, hosted a banquet at Wang's home to invite colleagues to celebrate. After the banquet, Wang stayed overnight at his concubine's place. Wang is currently an auxiliary police officer in the Changshu Road Police Bureau's volunteer police force and has a self-defense pistol and a car for transportation. The next morning, after Wang got up to use the toilet, he suddenly found that his self-prepared pistol was missing. He asked his concubine urgently, and Peng brought out a handful of pills, instructing him to take them, saying that the gun would be returned after taking them. Wang was suffering from a toothache at the time and did not suspect anything. However, after taking them, he felt dizzy and confused. He immediately called the second landlord, Mr. Huang, to the scene, saying that if he was poisoned to death, please testify, etc. He was then rushed to Nanyang Hospital for treatment in Wang's car, and it was reported that he was fine. Afterwards, the hospital reported the information to the Songshan Road Police Precinct. Song Tingjun, the director of the precinct, instructed Section Chief Zhong to send personnel to summon Wang Yaozeng and his concubine Peng Meiying for questioning. According to her statement, she has been living with Wang for seven years and has three children. Their relationship is usually good. A few days ago, a friend of Wang borrowed 20 silver dollars, which were returned to her. Wang asked her for them, but because she wanted to make new clothes, she did not return them, and a quarrel broke out. On the morning of the 13th, he wanted to use his self-prepared pistol to kill her, so she took the opportunity to hide the gun. He could not find the gun and secretly took sleeping pills to commit suicide. After finding something wrong with his expression, she sent him to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. She knew nothing else. Later, she replied to the interrogating officer, saying that she often went to her husband's friend Yuan Pu's house to play, but there was no ambiguity. After Yuan was summoned to the bureau for questioning, he said that he was a friend of Wang Yaozeng, and Wang's concubine Peng often came to his house to play, but there was no relationship. He also did not know about the quarrel between Wang and Peng. The precinct believes that the case is confusing and there must be hidden circumstances. In addition to temporarily detaining Peng Meiying, it will investigate whether there is any suspicion of coercing suicide and then transfer it to the District Prosecutor's Office for trial.

### Famous Throughout Shanghai Twenty Years Ago - Now Even Housing and Food are Problems - Wang Hanlun Sighs to the Heavens

Housing Dispute with Zhou Xiang-sheng - Petitioning Mayor Wu for Relief

[Reported by this newspaper] Wang Hanlun, the tragic star who was famous in the film industry 20 years ago under the name "Little Widow", has recently been forced to move by her landlord Zhou Xiang-sheng. Because she is unable to move elsewhere, she has personally submitted a petition to Mayor Wu requesting relief. The city government has transferred the matter to the Land Affairs Bureau, which summoned both parties a few days ago without any result. It is now scheduled to convene both parties again on the 19th to conduct mediation.

Wang's residence is at No. 19, Lane 918, Linsen Middle Road, which was originally Xiang-sheng Apartments operated by Zhou Xiang-sheng. Starting last year, Zhou wanted to take back the house and give it to his concubine, surnamed Wang, so he took action to move her out. Wang's residence is only a pavilion room, less than ten feet wide. The interior is even more messy. According to her, she has lived here for six years. In the past six years, she has worked as a beautician at the Shanghai River Beauty Salon to make a living and has long been separated from the film industry. This aging star often sighs when talking about the past, saying that the past is like a dream and she really feels unbearable to look back.

Wang entered the film industry as early as before the 16th year of the Republic, becoming famous throughout Shanghai with the film "The Orphan Saves His Grandfather". Because the various tragic films she starred in, such as "Yu Li's Soul" and "Spring Boudoir Dream", sold very well in Southeast Asia, the largest Star Film Company at the time relied on her as a pillar. She later married Wang Jihuan, a famous person from Hangzhou, but they divorced after only living together for 100 days due to incompatible personalities. Before the War of Resistance, she spent her own money to establish Hanlun Film Company, shooting two sound films, "Blind Love" and "Red Flower Vase". When Shanghai fell, the enemy forced her to serve as a propagandist at the pseudo "Greater China Radio Station", which Wang婉 refused. She then officially left her screen career and lived in seclusion under a pseudonym. Over the years, her savings have been almost exhausted, and her income from beauty work is minimal, so she often cannot afford three meals a day. Her haggard appearance is evident in her struggle to make a living.

She expressed that she does not want to ask for help from the film industry or any better-off younger stars in this housing dispute, because she feels that she has been treated with coldness and forgotten by them in recent years. She said that Bao Tianxiao had worked with her for a long time in the past, and she recently planned to ask Bao to write a script for her to perform in a drama, but she is worried about the fickleness of the world, the decline of her appearance, and that she will not be welcomed by the audience.

### Foreign Ships Sailing in Our Ports: National Shipping Association Opposes

The National Shipping Industry Association issued a declaration yesterday opposing foreign ships sailing directly from ports close to war zones to other ports in our country. It stated briefly: Recently, the British Embassy in China has again requested our government to grant special permission for foreign ships to transport supplies directly from ports close to war zones to other ports in our country. In other words, it is requesting the opening of coastal navigation rights, with the intention of regaining navigation rights, which is clearly revealed. The integrity of navigation rights is where the life of the nation lies, and we cannot allow them to be lost again. The two orders issued by former Executive Yuan President Sun, opening coastal and inland river navigation rights, run counter to the national policy of safeguarding sovereignty and should be abolished immediately. If foreign merchant ships disregard our public opinion and blatantly infringe upon our navigation rights, we will resist at any cost to maintain the last chance for our national shipping industry.

### Eviction Dispute: Chief of the Xihu Police Section Accused

[Our Correspondent] Lu Yaomin, the nephew of Lu Zhenjiang, former deputy director of the Business Office of the Two Railway Administrations and former chief of the Xihu Police Section, has filed a lawsuit with the District Court accusing them of searching his residence and destroying miscellaneous items. According to a spokesperson for the Railway Administration yesterday, the Police Department has already submitted a document to the District Court, stating the details of the entire case and filing a counterclaim, briefly stating: There is a small iron-roofed house next to the North Cargo Station of the Railway Administration, which was originally borrowed by the North General Station and temporarily used by the Police Section as a detention center for criminals. Lu Zhenjiang borrowed it last autumn to use as his residence temporarily. Later, Lu was dismissed from his post for some reason and soon passed away. Afterwards, the situation became tense, and the Xihu Police Section concentrated the police officers in one place and needed housing. Since Lu had left his post long ago, his family was notified to move out. Since the Police Section urgently needed the house, it was reported to the Police Department for approval, and Inspector Wang Du was dispatched to take back the house, along with a list of the furniture and objects stored inside for collection. Many days later, a man named Lu Yaomin, claiming to be Lu's nephew, came to the section and claimed that a suit and two ties were missing and demanded compensation before he would move out. The section stated that there were no suits or ties on the list and did not accept the claim. Later, Lu's wife came to collect the stored items. Recently, Lu Yaomin suddenly filed a lawsuit with the District Court, accusing Liu Yao, Wang Du, Yang Jian (who handed over the items to Lu's wife), and two others. The Railway Police authorities believe that Lu Yaomin is suspected of intentional defamation and have filed a counterclaim.

### Beiping Style (4)

— Jiang Xue

(Report on a city before and after the "Partial Peace")

Mao Zedong pointed out in "On Coalition Government" that the current revolutionary movement in China is still in the stage of New Democracy. Only by transitioning from the stage of New Democracy to Socialism can Communism be realized. A coalition government is a political form for implementing New Democracy, a temporary transitional government. Once the stage of Socialism is entered, it will be a political form of proletarian dictatorship. In order to adapt to China's national conditions, Mao Zedong revised the development of the Communist revolution into two stages: New Democracy and Socialism. The content of New Democracy is the genuine implementation of the Three Principles of the People, largely similar but slightly different. The political line currently adopted by the Communist Party in the cities is naturally a form of coalition government under the leadership of the Communist Party, which can better obtain good responses in various aspects.

Another issue is the relationship between the CCP and the Soviet Union. After the retreat from Changchun and Shenyang, people from the Northeast living in Beiping often brought information about the situation after the Soviet army entered the Northeast, such as Soviet soldiers raping women, so that people in Shenyang with girls over the age of sixteen at home tried to find an object and marry them off hastily to avoid problems. Many of the families of Communist army cadres were also raped, causing resentment. Even female Soviet soldiers raped men, because their bodies were too strong! A captured National Army soldier, during training in Harbin, debated a question with a Communist army instructor. He (the National Army soldier) said: "You say that the United States is imperialism, and we should overthrow it, and I agree. But the United States is imperialism, and it sends us many relief supplies without any cost to help our people. The Soviet Union is our friendly neighbor, but it has taken many of our Northeast materials and machines to the Soviet Union. How do you explain this?" The instructor could not answer and said, "You are right, I cannot answer this question. I will ask a higher-level instructor to answer you." Later, the higher-level instructor came, but he did not answer the question either. He only said, "Let's all eat now, no more discussion."

During the Beiping peace talks, a friend of the author, representing a certain party, met with the Communist army outside the city. In addition to negotiating the task itself, he also discussed many theoretical issues with a political commissar under Ye Jianying. The friend asked what the relationship between the CCP and the Soviet Union was. The comrade's answer was very clever! He said: "The CCP is completely centered on Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is a person who is based in China. All political decisions and revisions are based on adapting to China's national conditions, such as New Democracy, which was proposed based on China's national conditions. As for what kind of relationship Chairman Mao has with the Soviet Union, we do not ask." Still, no answer was obtained.

Although there were also Soviet advisors directing operations in the People's Liberation Army attacking Pingjin, what exactly is the relationship between the CCP and the Soviet Union? The author cannot explain it concretely here.

(4) The Press in Beiping after Peace

In the past, there were more than twenty newspapers, large and small, in the Beiping press. Except for a very small number that were publicly operated, most were privately operated. Because people's purchasing power was weak and the circulation was small, it was very difficult for many newspapers to be self-sufficient, except for the disguised subsidies of allocated paper. After Beiping was surrounded, people needed to know the development of the war, and everyone bought a newspaper, and selling newspapers became a popular profession. After the realization of partial peace, because the agreement stipulated that the original newspapers would be published as usual and then apply for examination and registration later, even the Kuomintang newspaper, the North China Daily, which was most strongly anti-Communist, continued to be published without ceasing publication. It's just that the president had already slipped away to Nanjing.

After the Communist army entered the city, their main focus was on propaganda work. First, they took over the North China Daily and renamed it People's Daily, Beiping Radio Station was renamed Xinhua Radio, and the Central News Agency was renamed Xinhua News Agency. They began to undertake the propaganda tasks assigned to them by the Party.

The People's Daily started publishing after one day of preparation. It was a full-sized newspaper, priced at 2 yuan in People's Currency per copy. The content appeared entirely in the form of a Party newspaper. Lengthy propaganda texts filled the pages, and all the broadcast material from Xinhua News Agency was also published. A special dispatch was always over a thousand characters long, but there were very few ordinary news items. Their style of arrangement and writing was different from the original Beiping newspapers. Its characteristics are as follows:

(1) Ordinary newspapers are edited in the evening and published before six o'clock in the morning; while the People's Daily is edited in the morning and published at noon, one or two o'clock.

(2) Ordinary newspapers focus on news reports and social news; while the People's Daily is the opposite, and there is not even a single social news item.

(3) Ordinary newspapers focus on advertising and economic quotations; while the People's Daily did not originally publish any advertisements or economic quotations. Later, due to practical needs, it selectively published a few columns of advertisements and economic news.

(4) Ordinary newspapers are mostly sold in the city of Beiping and on the main lines of several railways; while the People's Daily, in addition to selling a part in Beiping, is mostly sent to government staff at all levels in the liberated areas and to the armed forces for reading as propaganda.

(5) The original price of newspapers in Beiping was 30 yuan in gold yuan for those in a quarter sheet, and 20 yuan for those in an eighth sheet; while the People's Daily, a full sheet, was only sold for 2 yuan in People's Currency, equivalent to 20 yuan in gold yuan. The price was particularly low. Some colleagues suggested that it raise its price, but it said that this was a decision of the Party and could not be changed arbitrarily, and it was not subject to the restrictions of the industry association.

The employees of the People's Daily, except for the personnel of the editorial and interview departments, were all retained, as well as the distribution, management, and printing workers. The current printing volume of the People's Daily is 60,000 to 70,000 copies, which is two to three times more than the North China Daily.

In addition to the People's Daily being the CCP's Party newspaper, the remaining privately-operated newspapers adopted a policy of self-reliance to avoid the crime of controlling public opinion. First, the source of news was blocked, so that you could not obtain a single item of news, and yellow social news was also difficult to publish. The Xinhua News Agency's correspondence was only supplied to newspapers that had been examined and registered. News agencies that had not been examined and registered had difficulty with news sources because there was no correspondence. Furthermore, even if you received Xinhua News Agency's broadcasts yourself, they were all the same, largely similar. People would of course prefer to buy a full sheet of paper rather than an eighth sheet of paper for the same price. Moreover, the People's Daily published the People's Government's announcements, which had to be read. As a result, newspapers that had sold tens of thousands of copies in the past fell to one or two thousand copies, or even only a few hundred copies. With a sharp decline in sales and no income, they were of course unable to maintain operations and had to cease publication on their own. Many privately-operated newspapers in Beiping ceased publication for this reason.

However, on the other hand, the circulation of privately-operated newspapers such as the World Daily actually increased. There are several reasons for this: First, the newspaper had some special dispatches from Nanjing and Guangzhou, and everyone hoped to know some news from the South after the general isolation of information. Second, after other privately-operated newspapers ceased publication, they naturally ceded some readers to the World Daily. Third, the World Daily has a longer history, and the people of Beiping have a deeper impression of it. The increase in circulation and the possession of a large readership was certainly a happy event for the World Daily; but at the same time, it also attracted the jealousy and hatred of the CCP, and the main reason for the later seizure under the charge of being part of the CC clique. The CCP is unwilling to report unfavorable true news in its occupied areas, and it is also unwilling to have a third-party position. The existence of newspapers with wide circulation is a great spiritual threat to them! The World Daily is a privately-operated newspaper, and its circulation is relatively large, so they certainly did not want it to exist, but they had to find a plausible reason to do so, otherwise it would conflict with their own propaganda policy. Therefore, they added the charge of being part of the CC clique to Cheng Shewo, which was actually a great injustice! In the past, the World Daily had adopted a conciliatory attitude towards the CCP, leaving room for maneuver. Their headlines always referred to the CCP as "remnant Communists," and never labeled them as "Communist bandits." Their criticisms of many government measures were very sharp and greatly dissatisfied with corrupt politics. In the political environment at the time, this was already very difficult! As for the many minor points listed by the CCP, they were unavoidable minor phenomena in the large environment at the time, and they were not enough to prove that Cheng Shewo was a member of the CC clique. After the peace in Beiping, the World Daily's remarks were even more in line with the People's Daily, and it worked very hard! It is true that "if one is determined to condemn someone, one can always find a pretext!" The seizure of the World Daily shows that the CCP does not allow true freedom of speech, and it has torn off its own democratic mask.

In addition to the policy of self-reliance, the CCP's policy towards privately-operated newspapers in Beiping was to either allow or secretly encourage the newspaper's employees to liquidate and struggle against the management, causing them to harm each other and move towards destruction together. Similar liquidation events occurred in almost all newspaper offices, claiming that the management had exploited them in the past and that they must be compensated. Even newspapers that were losing money every month were no exception. The New People's Daily, because it had more pro-CCP elements within it, announced its independence in another way, breaking away from the head office and forcing the original manager to resign. Under the control of the CCP, it was jointly operated by the employees to accompany the CCP's guarantee of freedom of speech.

After the realization of partial peace in the Beiping press, the content of the newspapers was originally cautious due to the change of environment. Hoping to retain the opportunity to apply for registration, they all looked to the People's Daily, but the Xinhua News Agency's broadcast news was all the same, with no news value and no need to read it! However, the World Daily Evening News was still seized, the New People's Daily declared independence, and many other privately-operated newspapers ceased publication one after another. Currently, the People's Daily dominates the scene alone, in a state of desolation!

Ji Ang and Musa sent several telegrams in succession, causing dissatisfaction among the CCP. Therefore, based on the meaning of military control, the Beiping Military Control Commission directly notified all foreign reporters and news agencies stationed in Beiping to stop their activities. True reporting is not needed in the CCP's areas! Not only is news reporting not free, but also the personnel sent from outside are under protection and surveillance, and they try their best to avoid contact with the society, so that they cannot understand the true situation. Mythical legends were discovered in Shanghai newspapers. The CCP is very realistic. In order to consolidate its rule, it can discard the false mask of democracy at any time under various explanations, unlike the Kuomintang's bureaucratic style, which is hesitant and scrupulous.

The democratic style and freedom of speech advocated by the CCP are strongly fought for in the Kuomintang areas. But in the CCP's occupied areas, it is not very applicable. The phenomenon manifested by the Beiping press after liberation can provide full proof. But then again, Beiping has after all realized partial peace, and all measures seem to be relatively enlightened and progressive. In addition to the People's Daily, it can still allow one or two privately-operated newspapers controlled by the CCP to exist. And Tianjin only has one Tianjin Daily, and Jinan only has one New Democracy Daily. (To be continued)

The way of robbery was to take a car to other ports in the morning to commit the crime, and then return to Wuxi in the evening, so although he had done it many times, the case was never solved, and recently he was arrested in Nanjing due to a secret opportunity.

Ding, with his companions Zhang Chuncun, and another Mr. Zhang, carried a machine gun and took a car to Nanjing on the 11th of this month. That night, they robbed Wang Zhenzhong's house at No. 110 Shigu Road and snatched two gold bars. The three fled separately. However, after the case occurred, the police bureau in charge blocked all traffic arteries and searched, and Zhang Chuncun was captured at Jinyin Lane and one gold bar was found on his body, so he was taken back to the police bureau for questioning, and confessed the shape of Xu and other criminals. Zheng Secretary of the Criminal Police Team, and Ba Deputy Team Leader, led three officers, and together with two patrol officers from the police bureau, immediately went to Xiaguan to search. At 11:00, they took the night train to Wuxi, but when the train arrived at Zhenjiang Station, they found that one person had the same clothes and appearance as Zhang bandit confessed. Because the man put his hands in his arms, he did not take rash action. He then shot the man under the pretext of checking tickets. A machine gun was found on his body. He was indeed the main offender, Ding Jizhi. He was escorted back to Beijing. According to the confession, Mr. Zhang has already returned to Wuxi. The police bureau sent someone to Wuxi yesterday morning to meet with Li Inspector of the local police bureau, etc. However, Mr. Zhang was no longer there, and only a Cao was captured. A suspect surnamed Fan also took a car back to Beijing this morning for investigation and handling.

[Our Newspaper Wuxi, 14th Dispatch] Qingfu Silver Building in Sixiangkou, Zhongshan Road, in the city, at about 7:00 last night, a soldier in a yellow uniform arrived with a paper bag containing cigarettes, pretending to be banknotes, claiming to buy a gold bracelet. The staff of the store took out a pure gold bracelet of one tael, five qian, and two fen for him to look at. The soldier thought the style was not to his liking, so he asked for another one to be picked. The shop did not suspect him of anything else. However, the soldier had malicious intentions and took advantage of the opportunity to grab the gold bracelet and run away.

### Remittance and Cash Transport between Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangdong: Ministry of Finance Re-regulates Limits: Daily Remittances Not to Exceed 20 Million: Cash Transport to Guangdong Limited to 200,000 Per Person

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the limits on remittances and cash transport between Shanghai and Wuhan, the Shanghai Financial Control Bureau, following the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, has re-regulated as follows: The total amount of remittances from Shanghai and Wuhan to Guangdong shall not exceed 20 million yuan per day, and each remittance shall not exceed 200,000 yuan. The total amount of inward remittances paid by various banks and firms in Guangzhou each day shall not exceed 60 million yuan. Furthermore, the amount of cash that individuals may carry to Guangdong shall not exceed 200,000 yuan. Amounts exceeding the limit shall be deposited with the Central Bank for three months before being returned. For government agencies and industrial and commercial enterprises that must remit amounts exceeding the limit or carry cash exceeding the limit for normal purposes, they shall provide proof and submit it to the local Financial Control Bureau for approval. A certificate will be issued, and remittances or cash may be carried based on the certificate, without being subject to the above rules. In areas without a Financial Control Bureau, applications should be made to the local or nearby Central Bank branch. The Shanghai Financial Control Bureau has issued orders to the banking, money, trust, and insurance associations in the city and instructed them to comply.

In addition, the Jianghai Customs also issued a similar announcement yesterday, which has been implemented since yesterday.

[Another Report] Recently, the phenomenon of capital flowing south has become rampant again. In the past four days, the amount of gold allocation coupons flowing to Guangzhou is estimated by banking and money circles to be as high as 2.5 billion. As a result, there is currently a large amount of cash in Guangzhou. Although the Central Bank in Shanghai has recently issued a large amount of new banknotes with denominations of "100 yuan" and "500 yuan" every day, the shortage of banknotes among banks and firms is still extremely serious, which is the reason for this. Most of the capital flowing south is cash, carried by porters and travelers heading south.

### Draft Measures for Spot Gold Transactions: Gold Industry Association Has Prepared Them: To Be Promulgated and Implemented Once Approved by the Ministry of Finance: Preparations for Resumption of Business Are Being Accelerated

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Gold Commercial Association has prepared a draft of measures for spot gold transactions, which was recently submitted to Minister of Finance Xu for review by Xu Fusun, a leading figure in the industry. It is said that the measures will be promulgated and implemented as soon as they are approved by the Ministry of Finance. According to Xu, the industry's preparations for resuming business are being accelerated. For example, the number of member companies resuming business is still in the application and registration phase. Since the industry has been suspended for a long time, member companies must raise additional capital and shareholders to resume business, which cannot be accomplished overnight. In addition, if the association's location is to be used as a centralized trading venue in the future, it will require some arrangement, such as installing one hundred telephones, which cannot be completed in a short period of time. All of this explains why the industry has been slow to resume business. This resumption of business refers to the resumption of business by member companies of the association, so there is no broker designation at all, and there is no question of collecting margin deposits. The membership fee for members will be determined based on the number of companies that register to resume business. The association's members are mostly partnerships, engaging in business based on credit, and the association has always been committed to serving its members, so there are no provisions for collecting large membership fees.

In addition, the association held another meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday afternoon, with more than ten directors and supervisors attending, chaired by Zhao Zhongying, the acting chairman of the association. During the meeting, a detailed discussion was held on the registration of members resuming business, the arrangement of venues, telephones, and various trading equipment, and it was decided to accelerate preparations to enable the resumption of business to be realized in the short term.

More than eighty applications for resumption of business have been received from members of the association. As for how many companies will actually resume business in the future, industry leaders believe that it is impossible to predict in the current environment.

### Central Bank Secretly Buying While Officially Selling: Gold Market Rebounds

[Our Newspaper's Report] The gold market opened high and closed high, with a sudden dip in the middle, showing a tortuous trend. The bulls exhausted themselves in cutting losses, with most being trapped. The bears did not fully gain the upper hand in the environment of a high opening and high closing. In the early morning, influenced by the easing of overnight credit, market sentiment was optimistic. Interbank interest rates were low, with supply at 85 yuan and demand at 95 yuan. Positions varied, and quotations were extremely chaotic. The market opened at 340 and 345. After opening, news that the Central Bank had raised the allocation price for gold allocated to jewelers strengthened market sentiment, and the overall outlook was optimistic. There was still strong buying interest on the surface, and the market rose to 347 and 350 at one point. After the high, major players feared a reversal and sold at high prices, causing the market to fall slightly. However, because the index was released, market sentiment was relatively strong, and retail investors frequently bought, so the market hovered around 340 without showing signs of weakness. However, due to repeated blows, the psychology was quite weak, and because new short positions were active, the market still saw more selling than buying, and the market hovered around 335 in the second session. Around 11:00, the Central Bank frequently exerted its power, and the market suddenly weakened, falling to 325 and 330. Finally, it fell into the 320s. The market was exhausted, and trading was sluggish. Subsequently, rumors spread that the Central Bank was buying after the low, so market sentiment rebounded, and the market rebounded again. The bulls bought, and the new shorts rushed to cover, causing the price to rise from 325 to 335, finally reaching the 350s, and closing in the afternoon at 345 and 352. In the afternoon, credit was even looser, and interbank interest rates fell to 0.55 yuan. Retail investors took advantage of the low price to consider entering, and market sentiment was quite strong, so the market opened at a high price of 385 and 390, then gradually softened, hovering around 380 first. After 3:00, it fell to around 375 again. After 4:00, it rebounded again, finally hovering around 380, and finally closed in the evening at 378 and 380.

The rise and fall of the US dollar followed the fluctuations of gold. The market opened at 6,800 yuan and 6,900 yuan, fell to a low of 6,400 yuan, closed in the morning at 7,000 yuan and 7,050 yuan, opened in the afternoon at 7,700 yuan and 7,800 yuan, fell to a low of 7,500 yuan and 7,550 yuan, and closed in the evening at 7,550 yuan and 7,600 yuan.

The price of gold allocated by the National Bank to jewelers has now been decided by the Gold and Silver Stabilization Committee to be changed to 345,000 yuan per market tael, an increase of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

### Hong Kong Exchange Rate Further Shrinks

The Hong Kong exchange rate opened at 6 jiao 6 fen per thousand yuan yesterday morning, and closed at 7 jiao 1.5 fen the previous night. The gold yuan opened at 1 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen per thousand yuan yesterday morning, the same price as the previous evening's close. Hong Kong gold opened at 304 yuan per tael yesterday morning, and closed at 304 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen the previous night. The US dollar telegraphic transfer opened at 5 yuan 2 jiao 1 fen yesterday morning, and closed at 5 yuan 1 jiao 9 fen the previous night. The US dollar time draft opened at 5 yuan 1 jiao 9 fen yesterday morning, and closed at 5 yuan 1 jiao 8 fen the previous night. The US dollar opened at 5 yuan 1 jiao 6 fen yesterday morning, the same price as the previous evening's close.

### Credit Loosened Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday's credit trend gradually eased from level. At the initial opening, daily interbank interest rates still stood at 90 to 100 yuan. Subsequently, since the difference in interbank overnight payments was not significant, many intra-industry lenders supplied credit to the market. In addition, the national treasury and the municipal treasury disbursed approximately 2.5 billion yuan, and outward remittances totaled approximately 4 billion yuan, with domestic remittances accounting for half. The easing of credit gained momentum. Since the National Bank's unannounced selling of yarn had stopped and gold was also putting on a false show of strength, the market's ability to absorb credit diminished. As a result, daily interbank interest rates plummeted, with supply continuing even at 70 to 80 yuan, finally falling to a low of 60 yuan. The interbank position supply was abundant. The credit tightness that had lasted for more than a week showed signs of becoming more flexible.

Yesterday, the cash situation remained tight because the National Bank continued to implement restrictions on banks, and the need for salary payments in various industries in the middle of the month increased. Rumors were rife that the National Bank authorities had taken the opportunity to issue 1,000-yuan banknotes, but according to a confidential source at the National Bank, this was not true. Currently, the 500-yuan banknotes are sufficient for circulation, so 1,000-yuan banknotes have not yet been issued in this city.

Yesterday, the National Bank's clearing difference was over 520 million yuan, the clearing difference for foreign firms was over 1.03 billion yuan, the clearing input for major clearing houses was over 930 million yuan, and the clearing input for minor clearing houses was over 610 million yuan.

### Joint Preparatory Committee of Banking and Money Industries to be Cleared and Dissolved Soon

The Joint Preparatory Committee of the Banking and Money Industries of this city will soon announce its clearance and dissolution. According to the person in charge of the committee, the purpose of the Joint Preparatory Committee at the beginning of its establishment was for the banking and money industries to work together in times of trouble and provide mutual assistance when there were problems with capital turnover. However, the capital of the banking and money industries in this city is now very weak. Before the war, each bank could circulate the capital of several factories, but now the opposite is true, and the deposits of each factory can control several banks and money shops. This is enough to prove that the crisis in the banking and money industries is becoming increasingly serious today. The Joint Preparatory Committee of the Banking and Money Industries cannot play a role in this situation and has no need to exist, so it has been decided to announce its dissolution.

### Market Commentary: Spectator's Stand

Whether they show their power depends on today and tomorrow. The battle between British and American gold and banknotes is coming to an end, with the United States winning.

According to statistics from an authoritative agency, yesterday's price index was 1,873 times that of August 19, which is equal to 643 times the cost of living index at the beginning of the month, an increase of about threefold. The current index released last night was 1,339 times, equal to twice the beginning of the month. This means that the cost of living index for the current period has been reduced by about 30%.

All the employees in the city got 1,339 times their wages, that's last night. But yesterday morning, various markets had already started to rise. Like food and wuyang etc, most rose by 20%; that is to say: the 1,339 times wages were invisibly reduced by 20% again.

This lesson, has become as natural to the workers as human instinct, and a movement to exchange goods will immediately unfold in the next few days. Therefore, the next few days will be the touchstone of whether the financial authorities can control the market.

In the past week, the capitalists knocked out goods and prepared the salaries to be paid yesterday. The financial authorities took advantage of the situation and uniquely enjoyed the glory of controlling the market. The next few days will be days of headwinds. It is much more difficult to steer in the headwinds, so those who can steer in the headwinds are truly capable.

Half a month ago, the overt and covert struggles between the United States and the Britain in finance, set off a not-so-small storm in the world gold market. We have repeatedly analyzed in the past that it was: Britain wanted to raise the price of gold and suppress the US dollar. The United States wanted to maintain the US dollar and suppress the price of gold. Therefore, the price of gold in the Americas was stable, and the price of gold rose on the continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa.

This overt and covert struggle seems to be coming to an end in the past week. Facts have proven the failure of Britain and the victory of the United States again.

The price of gold in various parts of the world has gradually fallen back in the past week. The price of gold in France has fallen to the lowest price seen in eight years. Argentina, originally instigated by Britain, controlled gold in an attempt to stimulate the gold markets in South American countries, following the rise in Africa. Now, Argentina has also abolished this control.

During Britain's mischief against the US dollar, the Soviet Union also did a lot of cheering, and even single-handedly wantonly purchased gold in Milan, Vienna, and Berlin. Now they have also stopped purchasing. The announcement by the Bank of France that France's gold reserves reached 875 million pounds further contributed to the tragic decline in already collapsed gold prices.

When Britain was making trouble for the US dollar, the Hong Kong gold market also did a lot of responsibility in the Far East. Now that Britain has a tendency to cover up and rest, the Hong Kong market should also react. But the trend of gold and banknotes in Hong Kong last week only showed the firmness of the US dollar.

The price of gold and banknotes in this city, in addition to the influence of the local scenery, is also greatly stimulated by Hong Kong. Even if Hong Kong is still stable, the gold and banknotes in this city are purely determined by local factors in the future.

### Credit Shifts to Relax, Going Downhill is Relatively Good; Rice Went Up Again Yesterday: High-Quality White Rice Once Knocked on the 40,000 Yuan Mark

The rice market rebounded again yesterday. The South Rice Market opened slightly higher by 400 or 500 yuan. Then, due to the relaxation of credit, rice shops increased their purchases and the market rose by 2,000 or 3,000. Bo Dao [thin rice] once reached the 40,000 yuan mark. Then, due to the fatigue of gold prices, market sentiment softened, and prices fell back slightly. Bo Dao closed at 39,000, up 2,000 yuan. In the Northern Market, white rice and Bo Dao opened at 38,000 yuan each, up 1,500 yuan each. Extra-quality rice knocked on the 40,000 yuan mark. A total of 3,605 shi were registered for arrival at the second market.

Edible oil hovered and rose. Because credit had slightly loosened and rice prices had already risen in Shanghai, the goods owner held steady. Soybean oil initially opened at 148,000 yuan, and the market once fell back to 146,000 yuan. Finally, soybean oil traded at 151,000 yuan, and raw rapeseed oil closed at 149,000 yuan, up 8,000 to 9,000 yuan. Raw oil rose by 5,000 yuan, and Qingdao Jibao raw oil traded at 185,000 yuan. Cooked rapeseed oil and tea oil were still level. Soybean cake also fluctuated little.

The flour market turned firm. In the early market, with the loosening of credit, the Northern gang slightly increased purchases. The rice price had soared, and market sentiment was very excited. Lao Che [old car] initially pressed against the 16,000 yuan mark. Bing Chuan [warship] once traded high at 15,450 yuan. Midway, the market fluctuated violently due to the rise and fall of gold and stock prices. After the market closed, the big households made considerable purchases. Bing Chuan rebounded to 15,300 yuan, and Lao Che was quoted at 15,800 yuan. The sale of bran by wholesale and retailers was sluggish, and the market showed a slight downward trend.

The coarse grain market was affected by the firmness of the outside circle and rose sharply across the board in the early market. Jiujiang Dongdou [winter bean] traded highest at 33,000 yuan, and local bean rose to 31,500 yuan. Later, the oil cake market weakened, and purchases from wholesalers and factories were sluggish. The price of Dongdou fell by 10%, and the price of local beans fell below the 30,000 yuan mark. Sheng Ren [raw peanut] rose slightly by 5,000 yuan. The price of corn and sesame turned weak in the later market.

### Outbound Tea Firm

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to tea industry related people recently, although overseas markets still favor Chinese tea, prices have recently surged, and tea costs have followed suit, gradually detaching from the price overseas. The export price thus lacks something. British firm Jardine Matheson once resumed their offensive on Keemun black tea, but sellers have been resolute and ultimately failed. Overall, the export of Chinese tea currently does not have an optimistic outlook, and the consistent trend is stable.

The internal tea market is experiencing a tight squeeze. However, the market price continues to appear steady, the only reason being, that the old tea reserves are empty, and new goods are not yet produced, for various reasons, sellers do not relax their sales intentions, and there are still not many transactions, with only this street slightly involved, and other places have not yet started activity.

### Tung Oil Mediocre

After tung oil has been trending downward from the other day, the market today and tomorrow are due to ease due to relaxed credit among those in the industry. At the same time, foreign exchange certificates are rising sharply, so the seller's intention to raise prices has recurred. The process is gradually rising, but the buyers were aware of overseas markets are sluggish and sales are sluggish in the domestic spring, so they do not want to desperately procure so the situation is quite like a flash in the pan and plummeted sharply. The final results are similar to the previous day, and no changes have been seen.

### Wood Rising

The market price of Chinese fir has risen to 280 yuan, although the actual sales of foreign pine and Liu'an pine are sluggish, the market price is required to be 800 yuan based on the mixed colors. Liu'an plywood has risen to 3,600 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn Generally Rises, Cloth Sales Lack Vigor

The cotton yarn market situation yesterday was that the industry's credit turned loose, and external conditions were all reported firm. The yarn market also followed suit, and new purchases were gradually promoted. Southern China also continued to purchase, and this street also had to pay off. However, interbank interest rates still stood at around 90 yuan, so people still had concerns.

42-count Blue Phoenix initially opened at 2.72 million yuan, and at one point it loosened to 2.62 million yuan. It closed in the morning at 2.66 million yuan, finally rising by 150,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 140,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon rose by 50,000 yuan, closing at 1.69 million yuan. 21-count Flower Double Horse spot goods, after opening at 1.4 million yuan, immediately saw a downward trend, reaching a low of 1.32 million yuan. Near noon, due to many short coverings, the price recovered slightly to 1.35 million yuan at the close, finally rising by 130,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was at 1.265 million yuan, up 65,000 yuan. 16-count also followed suit and rose, while 10-count had ups and downs.

The cotton cloth market hovered and rose slightly. Sales to customers remained flat, and buying interest in this street was also slack. The green color was due to the slightly loose appearance of credit, but the interbank interest rates in the market were still high, so everyone was selling off goods and lending money, causing the situation that wanted to rise to shrink again.

Longtou fine cloth initially opened at a high of 53,500 yuan, but then many in the industry sold off at high prices, and finally it was difficult to resist, retreating to close at 51,000 yuan, which was 2,500 yuan higher than before. Labatong fine cloth rose by 2,000 yuan. Sijunzi Yuan Biji [fabric] initially opened at 50,800 yuan and was bid up to 51,000 yuan all the way, but at the close it squeezed into 49,000 yuan, up 2,600 yuan. Jinlian Miaowu Yuan Biji rose by 2,000 yuan, closing at 47,500 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the cost of living index being released, which was more than double that of the previous period, market sentiment was bullish, and various cloths rose slowly. Finally, it was heard that Sijunzi Yuan Biji traded at 54,200 yuan.

### China Textile Sales Cloth

[Our Newspaper's Report] China Textile Construction Company sold cloth as usual yesterday, opening 18 types, selling a total of 11,000 bolts, and 7,700 pounds of remnant cloth. There were 433 purchase orders, worth 564,334,000 yuan.

### Silk Stable

Yesterday in the artificial silk market, credit loosened, hidden interest rates fell, and market sentiment was stimulated by the release of the cost of living index, and buying interest turned strong. At the morning opening, 120 Tiangiao [brand name] was initially at 1.725 million yuan. During the middle of the day, there was a rumor that gold had collapsed, and the market was unsustainable, once falling to 1.62 million yuan. After the low, various parties covered on the low, and the market rebounded again, finally closing at 1.645 million yuan. In the afternoon, there were rumors that gold prices had rebounded, and credit outside the circle had loosened again, and market sentiment was still bullish. The market continued to rise, with the overnight position initially trading at 1.85 million. Then, it was heard that gold prices had fallen back, and the market softened slightly, finally closing at 1.835 million yuan.

High-grade raw silk was initially traded at 2.6 million, because credit was still loose and gold prices were firm, and buying interest was still strong, rising to 2.7 million yuan. After the high, the bulls turned to sell, and the market softened again, closing near noon at 2.65 million yuan.

The market sentiment was still firm at the morning opening for silk fabrics. The market had very strong buying interest, and the asking price rose. Maya initially opened at 1.195 million yuan, and at one point rose to 1.22 million. After the high, it was heard that cotton yarn had fallen back, and gold prices had plummeted, and market sentiment suddenly softened, returning to 1.19 million. At the morning closing, it was 1.203 million yuan. The market situation was stable in the afternoon, trading was not strong, and the asking price rose slightly by 10,000 yuan.

### Business Briefs

The Jianghai Customs announced yesterday that, effective immediately, the import tax rates for ammonium sulfate, granulated artificial fertilizer, and nitrates (import tariff numbers 440, 450, and 463) are uniformly reduced to 5% ad valorem. All of the above goods declared on or after March 15 of this year will be taxed at the new rate.

The Production and Export Business Loan Review Committee of the National Bank Discount Committee held its 16th meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, chaired by Fang Shanggui, and approved a total of 19 loan applications.

The market price of pig iron has risen sharply. Australian goods are opening at a high of 500,000, and Taiwanese goods have also reached 300,000. It is reported that the reason for this price increase is that holders of goods are raising the gold price ratio. For example, if the previously set price for Australian goods was one tael of gold per ton, now, because Anshan goods are asking for one tael and are being made, the Australian goods are asking for one and a half taels. Taiwanese goods also have a similar trend, but have not reached the one tael standard.

Since refined steel products have become darlings of the era, copper products have obviously been gradually abandoned. As a result, aluminum rods have become a mature raw material in the copper and tin market. According to an industry insider, aluminum rods were originally mostly shipped from Taiwan to Shanghai, but in recent years they have been sourced from Nanjing. The reason is that Nanjing does not produce aluminum; the source is dismantled from old aircraft that are no longer usable. It is said that each aircraft can yield approximately four to five tons of scrap aluminum, which is purchased by merchants, re-smelted into bars, and shipped to Shanghai for distribution. However, this is not always available, so it is said that when there is no scrap aluminum for sale in Nanjing, it affects the price increase in Shanghai.

Industrial oils remain stable. The arrival of asphalt from the South Road is small, and actual sales are not very strong. Tallow sales are more active, and the market shouted a rise of 5,000 yuan yesterday. Singaporean coconut oil still stands at 20 yuan per barrel, and Hainan Island oil is about 5,000 yuan less.

### Renyu vs. Encas: A Tightly Contested and Hard-Fought Match, the Score Fluctuates and the Game is Exciting

[Reported by this newspaper] The basketball league featured an exciting match last night. After 40 minutes of hard fighting, Renyu won the final victory with a score of 38 to 34, defeating the strong team Encas. The game was tight throughout, with the lead changing hands frequently. At halftime, the score was 18 to 17, with Renyu leading by one point. The situation in the second half was even more tense. The score was tied repeatedly at 19, 22, and 30. When Ochai Liao committed his fifth foul and left the court at 30 to 26, it was a fatal blow to Encas. Finally, Wu Xinyun turned the tide, and Sun Guozheng's brilliant shot broke the basket, ultimately winning against the enemy by four points. Xu Zhongyi, Shen Pengju, and Wu Xinyun of Renyu, and Que Libotuo of Encas were the most active players last night. Renyu showed an increasingly spirited performance in this battle. Encas was too fiery, which indirectly gave Renyu many opportunities for free throws. In another Group A1 match, Peifeier defeated Haiqing 56 to 36, and in Group A2, Maoxun defeated Youyi 44 to 33.

Last night, there were more than 3,000 fans. The Shanghai Education Museum was in full bloom. The third match, Renyu vs. Encas, was particularly eye-catching for the audience. The five players for Renyu were Sun Guozheng, Xu Zhongyi, Li Zhaohe, Wu Xinyun, and Yao Wenyi. The opponents were Que Libotuo, Ochai Liao, Bo Tou, Sasha Jin, and Ge Pengqi Guofu.

Shortly after the start, Xiao Yao committed a foul, and Bo Tou made a free throw to open the scoring. Que was light and nimble, adding two points. Wenyi scored a point to atone for his fault, 3 to 2. Xinyun injured his foot, and Pengju replaced him. Renyu missed two free throws, and Shen made three, tying the score. Wang Huaiting replaced Zhaohe. There was a double foul here, and neither side scored. Sasha Jin made a long-range shot with one arm, and his momentum was formidable. Xinyun replaced Guozheng, Renyu missed its fifth free throw, and Que was skilled and familiar, 7 to 2. Zhaohe replaced Huaiting, Qiu Quhu replaced Sasha Jin, and Ge Pengqi and Zhongyi scored one after another. Ge regained an inch, Xiao Yao scored a point, Zhaohe pushed in, and Xinyun jumped with both feet. After hard fighting, Renyu tied the score at 11. Unexpectedly, Ochai Liao and Qiu Quhu groped under the basket, and Bo Tou made a long-range shot from half court, also scoring three points, returning the favor, 17 to 14. Sizheng replaced Wenyi, Zhongyi and Xinyun were warmly supported by the audience, and actually made it 18 to 17, exceeding by one point. There was another foul on both sides, and Pengju and Ochai Liao were like brothers in misfortune, sympathizing with each other. Renyu took a slight advantage in the first half with a score of 18 to 17.

During the break, Renyu's foreign coach, Mr. Yang, was giving a lot of opinions, which caused dissatisfaction among the Encas players. Ten minutes passed, and they came into contact again. O obstructed and fouled, and Xinyun added one point, and soon it was tied again at 19. Pengju scored one free throw and one field goal, 22 to 19. Que scored three points in one go, and it was tied again at 22. Bo Tou moved like a rabbit, and reversed the situation with two points again. In an instant, it became 29 to 22, and Encas seemed even more smooth. Li Yao returned to his original position, and Renyu fought with all its strength, chasing to 30 to 26. Ochai Liao committed his fifth foul, and Qiu, the fat man, replaced him. Zhongyi scored a field goal, and Pengju made two free throws, and it became 30 points each, with no difference between them. Ge Pengqi's rudeness gave Guozheng one point. Xinyun's wonderful pass, Zhongyi hooked in under the basket, giving them three more points than the opponent. Que easily scored two goals, reversing the lead by one point. Xiao Wu turned the tide and won one point. There were still two minutes left, and the situation was precarious. Guozheng's lovely goal decided the fate of both sides. Zhongyi made a free throw, 38 to 34, and Renyu won the final victory.

### Maoxun Defeats Youyi

In the initial match between Group A2 Maoxun and Youyi, Maoxun gained a lead, but only by one or two points. Youyi followed closely. Ling Zhihao, Shi Hui, and Su Shifeng and others frequently made "uneven noises." Jin Yan was busy adjusting in and out, and the director forgot their original faces, showing color on the floor. In the first half, the score was 25 to 15, and Maoxun had extraordinary demeanor.

Each side closely monitored the other. After five minutes in the second half, each side scored one goal. The scoreboard showed "22" and "33" for a long time. Su Shifeng's performance last night was good. Every move was well-founded. Wei Yuping's "stealing cold rice" was also unexpected. As a result, Maoxun won 44 to 33.

### "Black Eats Black" Peifeier Defeats Haiqing

Peifeier versus Haiqing, two American military teams, a naval battle. Peifeier had full potential. Haiqing's passes were often intercepted halfway. Among the ten warriors on both sides, there were always more than three blacks, adding a lot of color (black). In the first half, Peifeier had 31, and Haiqing had 12.

Haiqing did a lot in the second half, but they had many opportunities under the basket. They could have shot themselves but still passed to others, which was enough to show their "unselfish" spirit. Ekat and Bolang of Peifeier, and Bo Lunhuo and Kaikeer of Haiqing were the main characters on both sides. In the end, Peifeier Kelishi scored with a single-handed breakthrough. The blacks on both sides marked each other, with a "black eats black" posture. At 56 to 36, Peifei defeated Haiqing by a large margin.

### British Navy Launches Third Expedition: Today's Clash with Qingbai Team

The British Navy's London football team recently returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong and has played two friendly matches with strong Chinese teams. In the first match, they drew 1-1 with the Railway team. In the second match, they were narrowly defeated 2-3 by the leading team, Longtou. This afternoon at 4:00 PM, they will play their third match against the Shanghai champion Qingbai team at the Yiyuan Stadium. Tickets are still sold at 400 yuan for ordinary seats and 600 yuan for special seats. Sales will begin at the Municipal Stadium at 2:30 PM. The referee is He Chunhui, and the linesmen are Ding Shunbao and Pan En. Qingbai will notify all players to wear red and black jerseys and gather directly at Yiyuan.

Qingbai is the leading football team in Shanghai and has won the Mayor's Cup for three consecutive years. This year, during the semifinals, they lost hope of winning the championship due to underestimating the enemy and being poisoned by Zhonghang. However, the Group A championship of the league seems likely to be taken without any problems. The entire team, under the leadership of veteran Meng Yiliang, has four knights, Huang Shijie, Jiang Yuqing, Xue Peiran, and Fu Naitang, guarding the rear, and five tigers, Luo Shoufu, Jin Lusheng, Gu Yiche, Liu Longxun, and Liu Tiyin, lined up on the front line. The military appearance is complete and unmatched.

The British Navy London team is a strong team among British sailors. They have a crisp and spicy foot and abundant stamina. The match against Longtou fully demonstrated its characteristics. Although it lost by one goal, the performance was very excellent, and it was greatly appreciated by people inside and outside the circle. Today, they will meet the champion, and the exciting battle is expected. The players on the team are the same as when they fought the Railway team. The lineups of Qingbai are listed separately below:

Qingbai

### Sports World: Discussing the Situation of Hong Kong Football

### Chinese Team Has a Better Chance of Winning the Group A Runner-Up, and the Bus Team Is Quite Confident of Winning the Group B Championship

[Hong Kong News] Although the championship of this year's Group A League is bound to be won by South China South, the runner-up issue has suddenly become subtle due to the fact that Chinese team broke through the difficult hurdle of Kitchee again in a hard fight last Monday. Although the Bus team finally won against Hong Kong Club, the victory was quite dangerous. According to the rules, each team in Group A will play a total of 24 matches. Chinese team has already played 19 times and only has five matches left. The Bus team still needs to play eight matches. The opponents are South China, South China South, Navy, and Eastern. According to the current situation, Chinese team has a high probability of being able to win six more points. The most difficult challenges in the next five matches are South China South and the Bus team. The Bus team has the disadvantage of different prices at different times. Although their defeat to the Navy team was accidental, they did not perform well on the big stage of a free-for-all match at home last Sunday. Although the other team scored a penalty kick first, they only won by a small margin of three to two. It is doubtful that they will be able to score more points in the next eight matches. The challenges they face are actually more difficult than those of Chinese team. In addition to the most difficult challenge of South China South, they also need to play against Chinese team once, Kitchee twice, and St. Joseph's and the Police, who will always try their best against Hua teams. None of these can be said to be guaranteed victories. Although they are sure to win against Guanghua and the Air Force in two matches, how can it be considered certain that they can win the runner-up?

People say that the runner-up will be decided when the Bus team meets Chinese team again on the 26th of this month. However, I say that if Chinese team wins at that time, the runner-up will definitely belong to Chinese team. However, if the victory belongs to the Bus team at that time, I still think it is not permissible to be optimistic about the Bus team, because Kitchee is also a strong team. It is not easy to win one match, let alone say that the Bus team will win both matches against Kitchee. Therefore, I think that the runner-up issue in Group A will not be confirmed until the last week of the season. In the situation where South China South is sure to win the championship, there is such an embellishment, and the football league has not caused the audience to feel too bored.

One team being too strong inevitably reduces interest. No wonder the psychology of the audience in this year's football matches cannot be raised to the level of the triangular competition of the pre-war Southeast Star. Fortunately, there is still a very spectacular match to come, that is, the league champion will perform against the joint team. I think that if the joint team can use Tan Jun'gan, Gaoshanlong, Xu Jingcheng, Weida Luo, Hou Lu, Feng Kunsheng, Siweiya, Li Chunfa, Deng Yijie, Zou Wenzhi, and Li Dahui as their lineup to play against South China South, the tension will not be less than when the Chinese team played against Seoul in the league.

After two wins against Kowloon Army, the situation in Group B for Chinese team is also very subtle. Although the current Chinese team is at the top of the list with 34 points, they have actually lost one more point than the Bus team. There are still ten matches to come, and there are difficult challenges against South China, the Bus team, Kitchee, and the Navy. The reason why Kitchee and the Navy are also listed as difficult challenges is because when Chinese team first met Kitchee, they only drew a 3-3 tie, and when they met the Navy, they only won by a score of 1-0. The Bus team still has thirteen matches, and the difficult challenges include South China, Kitchee, the Navy, Hong Kong Army, and Kowloon Army. These challenges are also more difficult than those of Chinese team. However, in terms of personnel, the Bus team is actually the most prosperous in Group B. I still think that the call for the championship is actually the highest for the Bus team. The team's situation is not as bad as its Group A team. (Lai Duanfu)

### Novel Betting Method in Hong Kong: Football Lottery for Sale

### Each Bet Ranges from Ten to Thousands of Yuan

[Hong Kong News] On the 12th of this month, the Kowloon Detective Department received a tip that someone was selling a football lottery. Hua Detective Chief Liu Fu led detectives Ye Fa and Xie Binglin to No. 61 Kimberley Road, G/F, and arrested a European man suspected of being involved. Several dozen copies of the lottery and instructions were seized and filed. On the same day, the defendant was allowed to post bail of 500 yuan. The case was brought before Magistrate Keu Si of the Kowloon Magistrates' Court yesterday. The defendant, Robert Hu Li, 45, from Edinburgh, Scotland, residing at No. 60 Kimberley Road, G/F, was charged with operating a gambling den at his residence on the 12th of this month. The defendant did not appear in court yesterday. Kowloon Detective Chief Mo Daolin applied to the court for a postponement. The magistrate ordered the case to be postponed for trial today. It was found that this type of football lottery was prevalent in England, but it was the first time it had been seen in Hong Kong. Therefore, the content of the gambling is not known to the public, and the police did not disclose it yesterday. However, it was learned from rumors that the purchase of this lottery is not limited to its amount, ranging from ten yuan to thousands of yuan. The seller of this lottery has established an organization specializing in accepting bets from such gamblers. Hong Kong is the football kingdom of the Far East, and every time there is an important football match, tens of thousands of people flock to watch it. Therefore, who wins and who loses is also of great concern to football fans. They bet on the teams they think will win. There are also many people betting on the football league held every weekend. Therefore, this type of lottery is revealed by a gambling master. However, there are many types of gambling. In addition to betting on which team will win, there are also bets on the number of goals scored by each player, and who will score the first goal, who will score the second goal, etc., similar to purchasing place tickets in horse racing. If an upset occurs, the bettors who purchase this upset will make a large profit. Therefore, the leisurely class flocks to it. It is heard that the sellers of this type of lottery take a profit-sharing approach, that is, after deducting the profits they want to obtain, they will calculate the bonus with all of the gambling funds received. Because there are many people who buy it, their profits are quite considerable.

### Women's Basketball Tactics

— Translated and Narrated by Zhou Gong

I've wanted to write about women's basketball tactics for a long time, because: I faintly heard that the Basketball Committee authorities are preparing to adopt Canadian women's rules in the Mayor's Cup, which is why I put down my pen again.

Last week, I ran into a female basketball star who said that everyone only pays attention to studying men's tactics, and that people generally mention women's tactics less often, which is somewhat sexist. Her sarcastic remark encouraged me to pick up my pen again. Although these are just fragmented offensive and defensive tactics for women's basketball, they may become suitable teaching materials for teams that are just starting to play basketball.

In any sport, correct basic movements are a necessary foundation for an athlete. Being able to have correct basic movements, using them skillfully, and adding valuable experience will make one a mature athlete. In a basketball team, if you have six mature players, and the coach trains them to implement tactics skillfully, then because of familiarity, they will become even more skilled, and this team will become a formidable force.

During practice, you can see some players whose fixed two-handed shooting movements are not yet correct, but they go on to practice one-handed shooting; their footwork and turning movements are not yet proficient, so they often commit the traveling violation when holding the ball.

Therefore, many teams focus on adopting tactical play, but neglect the practice and correction of individual basic movements, resulting in awkward movements, lack of smoothness, clumsiness, and frequent fouls. If the basic movements are not fundamentally improved, then skills are like rowing upstream: if you don't advance, you retreat. How can you hope to become a top-tier team?

Mr. Wang Yangming said: "When a gentleman shoots, he must have upright intentions within and a straight posture without, hold the bow and arrow carefully and firmly, and then he can speak of hitting the mark." This points out that if a student archer does not have the intention of upright intentions within and a straight posture without, then even if he holds the bow, aims the arrow, draws the bow fully, and releases, he will not hit the mark.

Mozi also said, "A good bow is hard to draw, but then it can reach high and deep; a good horse is hard to ride, but then it can bear weight and go far." This also says that a good bow is hard to draw, but if one can use the correct method of drawing the bow, one can shoot the arrow high and far; a good horse is hard to ride, but if one understands the correct method of riding, one can bear weight and go far. If a basketball player wants to become a future star, they must start with correct movements, and first have correct basic movements, use them skillfully, and then the second step can be to enter the door of tactical application.

Mr. Forrest Foornan of the University of California has a good understanding of defensive tactics in women's basketball. The following are his views on defensive tactics in women's basketball.

In terms of defensive tactics in basketball, there has been great progress and great changes, divided into (1) man-to-man defense, (2) fixed zone defense, and (3) moving zone defense.

Man-to-man defense is where each defender is responsible for guarding one opponent, moving when they move and stopping when they stop.

Fixed zone defense is where each defender is responsible for guarding their own area, not allowing the offensive player to have the opportunity to break into the shooting area.

Moving zone defense is where three defenders must be united as one, must have a tacit cooperation, and must fill in each other's positions when moving.

Speaking separately, man-to-man defense is easier to implement. A player with experience prefers to use man-to-man defense, because he only needs to guard one offensive player, moving when the player moves and stopping when the player stops, not allowing her to easily get a good shooting opportunity.

### Last Week's Basketball Commentary Significant Progress of Foreign Players in the Second Round

In the two matches of the A-League last week, Hualian made great efforts after receiving new players, easily defeating Haiqing 56-42; MacLaines used tactics after training, defeating the out-of-form Shanghai Police 57-42. Due to Pfeiffer's victory over Hualian and MacLaines' victory over Shanghai Police, foreign player teams have made significant progress in the second round of the competition. In the upcoming Mayor's Cup, the strong Chinese teams will not be able to rest easy.

The strength of Haiqing in the later stages is not as good as that of Haiqing in the early stages. In the early stages, Haiqing still had a black player, and a defender who controlled the ball with his left hand. This team of Haiqing does not have a single player who is good at controlling the ball. They only rely on courage and lack intelligence. In defense, they could not contain Hualian's forwards, and exposed loopholes early in the first half, allowing Hualian to use fast attacks to score many points, forcing Haiqing's defense to collapse completely.

In offense, Haiqing did not break through Hualian's man-to-man defense. There was no player who was good at controlling the ball to create opportunities. When they were forced to a situation where they could not execute, they made mistaken passes and wasted opportunities. Therefore, Hualian's quick attacks and accurate shooting forced Haiqing to catch their breath with a score of 38 to 18 in the first half, and the whole situation was one of being beaten. In the second half, Hualian used a slow attack, controlling all the rebounds under the basket. Winning was easy and effortless. This battle was like a strong team facing a weak team, like hitting a stone with an egg, and there was nothing exciting about it.

Shanghai Police was in a slump in the last two games, and met MacLaines, who was performing at their peak, so a defeat was unavoidable.

Controlling the rebounds under the basket was MacLaines' top priority in breaking Shanghai Police's defense. In the overall game, the rebounds under the basket were almost entirely controlled by the foreign players. After Wang Rongsheng was penalized off the field and Shi Jiuquan was transferred out, MacLaines' tall player controlled the rebounds under the basket at will, and Shanghai Police lost more points at this time, and the situation was over.

Shanghai Police relies on skillful shooting to win. When they are on a hot streak, they can make nine out of ten shots and gain momentum and get on a roll. Unfortunately, in this game, they were not in good form when they took the field. Wang Bowen, who is good at long-range shots, only made one out of ten shots. Under MacLaines' tight zone defense, the central playmaker could not perform, and cross-cuts were also hindered. Shooting from sharp angles resulted in more misses than hits. If they did not hit and the rebounds under the basket all fell into the hands of the foreign player's tall player, Shanghai Police's scoring relied only on Wang Rongsheng and Liang Rongbiao's long shots, and occasionally He Zeng got the opportunity to sneak in. The team's form was not good, and the players, although brave, were also timid, and lost all confidence. Shanghai Police's abnormal performance was even worse than the game against Hualian, probably due to fatigue from too much practice. The players should pay attention to getting plenty of rest this week.

MacLaines' performance at their peak had solid defense. When attacking, they used smoke screens to cut into the basket and lay it in, which was clear and beautiful. When throwing the ball inbounds under the opponent's basket, they used a three-man parallel tactic, but the application was not yet proficient, and was far inferior to Pfeiffer's team's performance. The tall player Reese is the soul of the team. He is a player who is good at controlling the ball. Not only did he score 28 points himself, but he also created scoring opportunities for his forwards. Winning is based on a team's style of play. There is no flashy performance. The players are young and inexperienced, but their skills are improving, and they are one of the foreign player teams most welcomed by the audience. (Qi Gong)

### Remembering Rice Tickets in the Countryside

— Qi Nian

"Rice tickets" in the countryside, like "Yuan Datou" silver dollars in major cities, have emerged in the towns and villages along the Beijing-Shanghai railway line in Jiangsu and Kunshan in the past six months. They are more loved than the majestic Gold Yuan Notes, and they have effectively taken over in the countryside, becoming a de facto currency.

As early as last year during the "August 19th" price controls, restrictions on food reserves were quite strict, so the villagers deposited their excess grain in rice shops to avoid the eyes and ears of inspectors. The shops then issued a piece of paper, stating the name of the product, quantity, and depositor's name, etc. This was originally a receipt-style deposit slip. Who knew that soon after, due to the needs of the environment and reality, it would stand out and be exchanged in the market, becoming the "rice tickets" that are now widely popular in the countryside.

In itself, it is simple and unadorned, and its appearance is far inferior to that of the Gold Yuan Notes. It is a thin sheet of Daolin paper, printed in black ink, which is considered the most sophisticated. Otherwise, a small square of white newsprint, written with a brush and stamped with an antique vermilion shop seal, would also do the trick. And if even a clean sheet of paper is too much to spare, simply use a cigarette paper shell or a waste paper from a tooth powder bag, write a few words on the blank part on the back, and stamp it with a seal. Even this crude method can be used in the market and is equally trusted and treasured by the villagers.

Rice tickets often have a note added: "Settled at market price, no goods without payment." Thus, although it is a check that is nominally worthless and cannot be cashed, it has great magic power in the countryside. When prices are fluctuating violently, if you use Gold Yuan Notes to buy goods, the shop often imposes restrictions; but if you use "rice tickets" for the transaction, the shopkeepers will smile happily and are happy to do business with you, no matter how large the quantity. Conversely, when the villagers raise pigs like fattened piglets and bring them to the market to negotiate prices, they show difficulty if given cash, and ask if there are any "rice tickets." Sometimes, when trading with "rice tickets," even if the price is reduced somewhat, they are willing to accept it. Rice tickets and Gold Yuan Notes are both just pieces of paper, but the difference between the two in the minds of the people in the countryside is like heaven and earth. Is this just a matter of luck and misfortune?

Recently, the countryside is not peaceful, and the rice and grain stored in farmers' homes are easily coveted by bandits, so they are even more willing to transport the rice to the market and exchange it for "rice tickets." In this way, even if it is stolen, it can be reported lost and stopped for payment as a remedy. And a thin piece of paper can be stored in clothing and is easy to carry. When cash is needed, it can be settled at the market price at any time, and it is not affected by the devaluation of paper money. The shop will pay you a斗 or two, or a石 or two, as you like, as long as it is noted on the ticket, and they will never find it troublesome.

For rice shop owners, they can use the deposited rice as working capital, and under the condition of "no goods without payment," this batch of transactions can be safely placed in their shop, without fear of them going elsewhere, so they are all happy to accept the villagers' deposits. Thus, the situation of "rice tickets" flying all over the streets in the countryside is far more common than bank checks in the city. This is also a strange thing in a chaotic world.

### The Problems and Identification of Silver Dollars

— Yi Yun

This column has discussed "silver dollars" for two years, and the calls for "buying" and "selling" silver dollars have spread throughout the city. However, there are many defects in silver dollars, and there are also counterfeit products. In the past, when silver dollars were the standard currency, everyone was familiar with silver dollars, and it was still difficult to avoid being deceived. Now, more than ten years have passed, and most of the buyers are amateurs who do not know the defects, so they are easily fooled. Therefore, the methods of identifying defects and counterfeit products in silver dollars are briefly described as follows.

(1) Filing the edge: That is, the raised edge around the silver dollar has been filed off to take the silver layer, resulting in a reduction in weight.

(2) Acid: Silver dollars have been put into nitric acid to corrode and extract the silver.

The above two items can reduce the weight of the silver group, but they are still easy to identify with careful observation. Because of the acid, the pattern of the silver dollar will inevitably lose its spirit or be blurred; if you file the edge, you can see the pattern by careful observation. If it is hot to the touch when holding it, you can place the silver dollar on the tip of your middle finger and lift it to know if its weight is insufficient.

(3) Copper lining: This cannot be done without skilled craftsmen. The method is to saw open one side of the silver dollar, dig out the silver in the middle, fill it with copper, and then cover the silver surface well and install it properly. The surface is not easy to detect. However, this will inevitably reduce the weight, because the copper filled cannot fill the dug-out place. If it is filled, it will become a "dumb plate," so a slight space must be left, so the weight is of course insufficient. Also, if you strike this circle on its edge, the fitted side will inevitably show cracks; also, observe the pattern on its surface, it will inevitably be more rigid, and the sound will also be different. But this cannot be identified without a skilled hand.

(4) Copper filling: On the surface of the silver dollar, in the concave and convex areas of the pattern, choose the ones that can be dug and filled, dig out a small piece, and fill it with copper. It is not easy to identify at first glance, but it always feels different with careful inspection.

(5) All copper: This is a counterfeit coin, its quality is pure copper, and it is plated with silver on the outside. When you strike two circles together, the sound is wide and sharp, and the pattern is also very rigid.

(6) All lead: That is, silver dollars are cast purely with lead. They can be mixed in at the beginning, but after being stained with sweat, they gradually change color, and it is easy to identify when compared with the silver color.

In short, with careful observation, even an outsider is not easily deceived; with carelessness and impatience, even an old hand will inevitably be fooled. There is also a method: clamp the silver dollar with two fingers, blow air with your mouth, listen to it near your ear, and if the whole thing makes a slight ringing sound, it is genuine, otherwise it is fake. This is also a technique, but I am afraid it cannot fully identify the above-mentioned defects.

### Soy Milk

— Sang

Soy milk, also known as tofu milk, is a very common soy food in our country, especially in Shanghai, it is an extremely popular beverage for the masses. However, European and American countries have only discovered its value in recent years, and they beautifully call it "soy milk."

Recently, according to research by many scientists in the United States, it has received a very high evaluation and is being promoted as a substitute for cow's milk.

Soy milk is similar to cow's milk, and its composition is very similar to human milk, and it is superior to it. It contains one-half of the fat and protein of human milk, the same amount of lime, and twice the amount of iron as human milk. It lacks carbohydrates, which makes it a suitable food for people with diabetes; and if needed, lactose or maltose can be added to make up for it.

Soy milk is easier to digest than cow's milk. Because the coagulum formed by soy milk in the stomach is smaller than that of cow's milk, it requires less gastric digestive juice.

Soy milk can also avoid many diseases caused by cow's milk. Its production process is convenient, the price is low, and the yield is large. However, most Chinese people do not know how to further study and improve its production methods and nutrition, and only know how to stick to old methods. Moreover, those Westernized gentlemen despise soy milk as food for vendors and pedestrians and do not bother to show it. Now that even the most developed and advanced United States is studying and praising soy milk, I wonder what those gentlemen who think "the moon is better abroad" think?

### "Promoting Dancing" to Save the Country and Other Things

— Lei Ting

This topic, at first glance, seems a bit not solemn; however, it is a fact. In the past, we did have "dancing to save the country," and we also shouted this slogan. Now, "The Political Committee of the Huazhong Suppression Headquarters is considering opening up the dance ban in order to increase the number of self-defense special donations." At the time, the reporter added a note: "The sound of 'promenading' (dancing) that has been quiet for a long time in Hankou City is about to rise again" (both seen in this newspaper's Hankou 9th report).

Self-defense is to protect the people, and protecting the people is to save the country. Therefore, although the Hankou authorities did not explicitly shout the slogan "dancing to save the country" this time, it is the same to enhance the work of saving the country by opening up the dance ban. However, Mr. Chan Jia and others must not confuse dancing and saving the country, thinking that only dancing can save the country, and if you want to teach the country, you can only dance; otherwise, they will misunderstand the authorities' hardship in allowing or prohibiting dancing, and allowing it in one place but prohibiting it in another, so that there will be the idea that the authorities sometimes allow saving the country, sometimes prohibit saving the country, or allow it in one place but prohibit it in another, which would be far from the truth.

From my personal point of view, I neither like nor hate dancing, because I simply cannot dance. But dancing is not a sinful act, I am sure of that. The reason for my conviction is not because "foreign countries also have it," but because it is indeed a fact. As for the bad things that happen because of dancing, they are no more than the same as some people doing even worse things under grand and high-sounding titles. This is a people problem.

But not long ago, dancing was prohibited under the bigger titles of "correcting customs" and "practicing frugality," and it was prohibited so vigorously. Although Shanghai relaxed the ban because of a strike by the dancers, the ban was still to be banned. Drawing lots was to show that it was banned.

Since it is banned, the authorities naturally think that dancing is a sinful act, without any doubt. We small people, standing in the position of supporting the authorities' policies, also practiced "what the authorities hate, hate it," isn't that a good model of cooperation between officials and the people? And this good model has been amplified.

However, this time Hankou City reopened the ban in order to increase special donations. Special donations are important, but can we not need to "correct customs" and not need to "practice frugality" because of their importance? Or has Hankou City already corrected customs and practiced frugality after banning dancing once?

If the answer is the latter, we are truly happy for the achievements of banning dancing, but at the same time we are worried about the customs after opening dancing; if the answer is the former, then we are even more worried that the scope of "imprisoning in the emblem" will increase day by day.

Although this is a small matter, we can also understand other things.

### The King of Song, Bing Crosby

— Xin

Bing Crosby has become one of the leading entertainers in the United States today. With his voice, from the stage, to the microphone, to the screen, his voice is sweet and pleasant to everyone, and everyone seems to be enchanted. When he sings a new song, tens of thousands of copies of the song can be sold out in an instant. His recorded records have become the best-selling products.

Bing Crosby himself doesn't think he has a satisfactory singing voice. He stepped onto the throne of the King of Song, and he still feels a little inexplicable. When he left school, he didn't think about taking the path of singing, because he was a very ordinary person and didn't show any special talents. His brother only knew that he was still diligent. The two brothers thought at the time that singing was the easiest job, so they embarked on this path, making him a brilliant singing star today.

Initially, Bing Crosby recorded for Decca Records. The following year, he worked for Paramount Pictures. When Bing Crosby embarked on the path of singing, he took advantage of his singing voice, followed his own wishes, and destroyed all traditional singing rules without reservation. Although he did not follow the rules of singing, this new tone was very popular with people. Both Decca and Paramount were unwilling to discuss his resignation.

Bing Crosby has been working as a singer for twenty years. In those twenty years, in addition to singing on stage, innumerable radio broadcasts, and no way to leave a record, there are 698 songs recorded on wax discs. Among them, one song, the Christmas reading "Silent Night" recorded fifteen years ago, is Bing Crosby's most prestigious singing and the best-selling record. There are 38 films left on the film soundtrack, and recently there is also a "In the Court of King Joseph," which has been filmed and has not yet been released. In 1944, he was voted the best actor by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for playing Father O'Malley in the film "Going My Way." But to this day, Bing Crosby only admits that he is a singer, not a movie star.

Bing Crosby is a typical American, and his speech, attitude, and life are all American style. Even his singing voice and tone are thoroughly American. He likes to meet people with his original face everywhere. What we see on the screen is mostly his true face, and even when playing other roles, it is consistent with his original posture. Bing Crosby also has a characteristic that he will never be cold. No matter what he does, whether it is singing, dancing, or just standing quietly on the side, he can show his personality and give others an impression.

Today, Bing Crosby is a person with a very large income. But he lived a wandering life in his early years. When he fell in love with movie star Lindsay, and wanted to marry her, he was provoked by someone who said that he had no money and no special talents, and that his future life was worrying. Although he has now emerged, he still does not forget the poor and humble times in the past. His family lives near the Los Angeles Club, and they live a very simple life, with no luxurious atmosphere. In the broadcasting studio, he likes to talk to assistants, workers, etc. He said: "These people are upright and open-minded, and it is most enjoyable to interact with them." This is what Bing Crosby said to others, but it is also the feeling that others have of him.
