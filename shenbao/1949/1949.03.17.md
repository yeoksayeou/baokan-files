### New Cabinet May Offer a Fresh Start; He Yingqin Actively Forming the Cabinet; Justice Minister Zhang Shizhao, Secretary-General Huang Shaogu, Deputy Secretary-General Ni JiongSheng; Other Ministry Heads Being Invited

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] He Yingqin's new cabinet will appear with a detached attitude. Mr. He is currently adhering to this principle, inviting detached individuals to join the cabinet; he especially emphasizes the use of new talent, so that the cabinet formed under this most difficult situation can give the people a fresh start. Mr. He spent the entire 16th running around to various parties for the sake of forming the cabinet, while also using long-distance telephone calls to earnestly invite individuals from Guangzhou and Shanghai to join the cabinet. Mr. He also invited Legislative Yuan members Huang Yuren, Yin Shuxian, Huang Shaogu, Xu Gongshui, Wang Qijiang, Tang Ruyan, etc. to his official residence at 10:00 AM on the 16th to exchange opinions on forming the cabinet. Mr. He explained the preparations for forming the cabinet in detail, which lasted for two hours before the meeting adjourned. In the afternoon, Chen Cheng, Wang Lingji, and others visited separately. After a brief conversation, Mr. He left at 5:30 PM to visit the presidents of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, Tong Guanxian and Yu Youren, returning to his official residence around 6:00 PM. It is learned that the scope of individuals invited to join the new cabinet is very wide. For example, for the position of Minister of Education, the opinions of Mei Yiqi, Li Shuhua, Wu Yifang, and others have been sought separately. The Minister of Foreign Affairs has also successively invited Hu Shi, Fu Bingchang, and others. No conclusions were reached as of the evening of the 16th. Broadly speaking, only the appointment of Zhang Shizhao as Minister of Justice, Huang Shaogu as Secretary-General, and Ni Jiongsheng as Deputy Secretary-General have been finalized. Fu Bingchang for Foreign Affairs and Li Hanhun for Internal Affairs are also highly likely. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, with its newly established extensive powers, is proving difficult to find a suitable candidate for; although Weng Wenhao was invited, he declined. The candidates for the Ministries of Finance, Education, and Transportation, as well as the heads of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, have not yet been finalized. Former Minister of Water Resources Xue Mabizhi was strongly urged by Mr. He to join the cabinet and head the Ministry of Internal Affairs, but Xue declined. Although Mr. He's principles for forming the cabinet have been determined, he still faces many difficulties in practice. If all the invited individuals decline on various pretexts, then the new cabinet with a reformist style will be difficult to establish overnight.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] Bai Yunti, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, arrived in Nanjing by plane from Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 16th. After disembarking, Mr. Bai immediately went to Doujizha to visit Premier He.

Mr. Chen then accepted Bai Chongxi's invitation to lunch at Mr. Bai's residence.

Both Wang and Yang expressed to Acting President Li that local authorities would completely obey the central government regarding major policies on peace and war; however, they hoped that the central government would help resolve some difficult issues in local administration. The two men visited Premier He at 2:00 PM in the afternoon and Finance Minister Xu Kan in the evening, where they had some discussions. According to Chairman Wang's remarks to reporters on the evening of the 16th, he came to Nanjing in response to a telegram from Acting President Li to receive instructions and to present some difficulties in local administration. The situation in Sichuan is currently stable, but student unrest has been occurring frequently, demanding increased pay.

He has asked Acting President Li and Premier He for instructions, hoping that the central government can assist in resolving the pay issue. In addition, he will also request industrial loans and salt loans from the Ministry of Finance to solve the difficulties in the salt industry. As for the matter of Hu Zongnan's troops entering Sichuan, it is a false rumor and there is no such thing.

Acting President Li is even more eager for Mr. Yang to come out of retirement and has sent two telegrams through Bai Chongxi urging him to come. The wording is sincere and persuasive, stating: "The current situation is critical and calls for a concerted effort to save the country. Your brother's strategic talent has long been admired. We urgently hope that you will come to Nanjing to discuss national affairs," etc. It is reported that Mr. Yang is considering going to Nanjing.

Regarding the two opinions of Bai Chongxi advocating for preparing for war while seeking peace and Acting President Li's "ceasing war while seeking peace," he stated that it is appropriate for Acting President Li, in his position as head of state, to adopt an attitude of ceasing war while seeking peace, and it is also appropriate for Mr. Bai to talk about preparing for war while seeking peace as a military man. In short, peace is what everyone needs, and it is good to have genuine peace.

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 16th Dispatch] The Executive Yuan held its 48th Yuan meeting on the 16th, chaired by Wu Tiecheng. State Councilors Zhang Qun and Zhang Lisheng and the heads of various ministries and commissions attended. The reported items were: (1) Report on foreign affairs work, (2) Recognition of the governments of the Mandatory Palestine and the State of Israel, (3) Recognition of the new government of El Salvador, (4) Reorganization of postal and telecommunications services in Taiwan Province into a combined office, (5) Relief measures for judicial personnel evacuated from war zones.

### Acting President Li and Military Leaders; Discussing the Overall Situation at the Ministry of National Defense; A New Crisis Brewing as the Communist Army Prepares to Cross the River; Peace Talks to Begin with the CCP After the New Cabinet Is Formed

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] The political atmosphere in the capital is quite thick, becoming active due to the arrival of military and political personnel from various regions. Acting President Li presides over meetings morning and evening to discuss important issues. The meeting held at the Ministry of National Defense at 9:00 AM was presided over by Acting President Li, and He Yingqin, Xu Yongchang, Gui Yongqing, Zhou Zhirou, and others attended. The nature of the meeting was a military conference. It is generally believed that the Communist army is currently arrayed along the riverbank, preparing to cross the river, and peace talks must be conducted after the new cabinet is formed. Therefore, a thorough review of the overall situation must be made. In the afternoon, Acting President Li received Chen Cheng, Wang Lingji, and others at his official residence, and in the evening, he invited some members of the Legislative Yuan to a discussion meeting again at 9:00 PM. It is reported that Acting President Li is very concerned about the simplification of the structure of the Executive Yuan, especially the large organization of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which is very difficult to find a suitable leader for, and is also extremely difficult in terms of operations. On the other hand, after the number of ministries and commissions in the Executive Yuan is reduced, the possibility of enlisting members of various parties and political figures from social elites to join the cabinet will be reduced, which will affect the representativeness of the government. Therefore, Acting President Li discussed this main point at the meeting with members of the Legislative Yuan on the evening of the 16th, seeking a legal procedure to solve the difficulty. It was originally intended to adopt the method of submitting a reconsideration proposal by the Legislative Yuan meeting to make changes, but after research, it was believed that since the case had already been decided, it was not necessary to change it, and the proposal for reconsideration was cancelled. More than 20 people, including Chen Guangwen, Yuan Qijiong, Yin Shuxian, and Tu Gongshui, were invited to attend, and the meeting adjourned around 10:00 PM.

[Reuters Nanjing 16th Dispatch] Well-informed political observers here predict that if the government's peace talks delegation does not go to Beiping soon, the CCP will issue an ultimatum to the Nanjing government. People here point out the following signs to show that a new crisis in China is actively brewing: (1) Chen Yi's 19th Army Corps, with more than 300,000 troops, has been arrayed on the north bank of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, preparing to begin crossing the river; (2) CCP leaders believe that the National Army on the Yangtze River will not offer resolute resistance; (3) The CCP cannot afford to wait politically for indefinitely postponed peace talks. If the Communist Party wants to use military force to defeat Nanjing, it must achieve its goals at the peace talks table, and now is the right time. If the CCP waits any longer, the He Yingqin cabinet and the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan in Nanjing will put the country back on the right track of revival and regain some of the people's support. According to some sources, the government must formally express its willingness to start peace talks with the CCP no later than the 20th of this month. The resignation of the Sun Ke cabinet has delayed the preparations for peace talks for a considerable period. From the CCP's point of view, the only concern about launching a new offensive is the possibility of causing resentment among the war-weary people. However, at the peace talks table, this resentment can also be used by the CCP as a factor in its favor, forcing the Nationalist government to accept the conditions proposed by the CCP in order to take care of public opinion. He Yingqin's strategy must be to agree at the peace talks table to allow the CCP to control the future coalition government, but to try to retain the KMT's power in local administration.

[United Press Nanjing 16th Dispatch] The newly appointed Premier of the Executive Yuan, He Yingqin, is busy today organizing a "peace cabinet" in the hope of starting peace talks with the CCP as soon as possible. Since arriving in Nanjing, Mr. He has held several meetings with Acting President Li to discuss the members of the cabinet, so that the government can unite internally and be consistent externally. Chen Cheng and Zhu Shaoliang flew to Nanjing this morning, which may be a prelude to closer cooperation between the Southeast Group and the government, greatly enhancing the status of Mr. He's future cabinet. It is reported that Wu Tiecheng is in Guangzhou urging Guangdong Chairman Xue Yue and Pacification Director Yu Hanmou to join the cooperation.

### The Whereabouts of the Chongqing Warship Remain a Mystery; Gui Yongqing Believes It Is Still Moored in the Bohai Bay; Supervisory Committee Members Will Propose an Impeachment Against Mr. Gui

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] Supervisory Committee members Sun Yulin, Zhang Dinghua, and others believe that Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing was negligent in preventing the defection of the Chongqing warship and failed to provide reasonable treatment to the officers and soldiers of the ship, resulting in this incident. Mr. Gui should be held responsible and a decision has been made to propose an impeachment against him. They are currently soliciting signatures from various committee members.

[Associated Press Nanjing 16th Dispatch] Navy Commander-in-Chief Gui Yongqing told the press on the 16th that the mystery of the "Chongqing" warship seems to be about to be revealed. He said that the "Chongqing," which defected last month, is still moored in the Bohai Bay. Due to the limitations of international law, the ship has not sailed to Dalian. Mr. Gui also denied that the ship had been sunk by National Army aircraft.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] Since the cruiser Chongqing defected from Shanghai on February 26, its whereabouts, although once discovered by the Air Force in Yantai Port, have since been declared "missing." Currently, it has been confirmed by a third party that the ship is not in Dalian, and the Air Force, adhering to national treaties, has not been able to conduct an aerial survey over Lushun Port. According to the Navy Headquarters' judgment, the ship is likely still hiding in the Bohai Bay area, waiting for an opportunity to escape further. Although the Navy Headquarters is still trying to recall the ship by radio without investigating the responsibility for its defection, qualified sources believe that the ship is currently controlled solely by the original crew of naval officers and soldiers, mixed with about 300 Communist soldiers who boarded the ship in Yantai to "assist." The ship sailed out of Shanghai under orders to go to Taiwan, carrying 300,000 silver dollars in the Navy's emergency fund, to be distributed to the Navy units in Taiwan. The newly appointed captain was Lu Dongge, the original Operations Director of the Third Department of the Navy Headquarters. The original captain, Deng Zhaoxiang, was transferred to Deputy Director of the First Department of the Navy Headquarters and was ordered to assist Captain Lu on the ship for three months before the transfer, so that Lu would be familiar with the characteristics of the ship.

[Reuters Nanjing 16th Dispatch] Unofficial reliable sources say that National Army aircraft have indeed attempted to sink the Chongqing cruiser, which defected to the Communists, three times. The ship is currently hiding near Dalian in the Bohai Sea, protected by Dalian's Soviet anti-aircraft guns.

### The Legislative Yuan Committee Reviewed the Case of Stopping the Price Increase of Transportation Enterprises Yesterday; Intends to Establish Eight Principles to Investigate Responsibility

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan recently resolved to request the Executive Yuan to quickly stop the price increase of transportation enterprises and not to recognize the prices announced on the 11th. The Executive Yuan's office in Nanjing has replied to the Legislative Yuan, saying that it has notified Ling Hongxun, Vice Minister of Transportation in Guangzhou, by telephone to handle the matter. The Legislative Yuan also telegraphed Mr. Ling on the 16th, asking him to attend the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 18th to report on the reasons for the price increase of postal, telecommunications, and railway services and to be prepared for questioning. In addition, Mr. Ling telegraphed President Tong on the 15th, explaining the reasons for the price increase of postal, telecommunications, and railway services, stating: "In recent years, the fees charged by railways, postal services, and telecommunications have been too low, and income and expenditure cannot be balanced. It is necessary for the national treasury to provide large subsidies and adjust the rates at any time in order to maintain them. According to the formula, the rates for public utilities are proposed in accordance with Article 20 of the National State-Owned Enterprise Management Law. If they are adjusted once every ten days, the amount will be small. If the adjustment time is delayed, the amount will be large, which will inevitably stimulate prices and cause public criticism. This case is of great importance to the survival of transportation. I would like to ask for your support." The telegram was reviewed by the relevant committee on the 16th, and it was submitted to the Yuan meeting to consult the Executive Yuan to investigate the responsibility.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] The Legislative Yuan's subcommittee responsible for reviewing the price increase of railways, postal services, and telecommunications held a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 16th. Yuan Qijiong presided over the meeting. Various committee members spoke one after another, all criticizing the Ministry of Transportation for this matter and pointing out that the railway price increase has been the most severe since the "August 19" price limit, reaching 1,650 times. As a result, railway fares are too high, and people cannot afford to ride, especially the first and second class passengers are few. After a long discussion, eight principles were drafted and submitted to the Yuan meeting on the 18th for discussion. The principles are as follows: (1) Telegrams, telephones, and railways should be calculated according to the cost of living index for civil servants. (2) The "August 19" price should be used as the base number. (3) The adjustment time should be one month or half a month, to be decided by the Yuan meeting. The adjustment time should start from April 1. (4) Adjustments should be made separately according to region. (5) In terms of postal services, before the postal regulations are revised, the provisions of the postal law should still apply, and each adjustment should be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. (6) The review opinions on Vice Minister Ling's telegram to the Ministry of Transportation were discussed and resolved to consult the Executive Yuan to investigate the responsibility and investigate and deal with it in order to uphold the rule of law. (7) The postal rate increase shall be implemented from April 1 in accordance with the new price on March 11. (8) The subsidy funds approved by the government for state-owned transportation enterprises should be allocated by the Ministry of Finance before the 5th of each month according to the subsidy amount for the previous month, and the insufficient amount should be allocated in one lump sum on the 5th of the following month. (9) State-owned transportation enterprises should pay for all military transportation and military telecommunications costs in cash. State-owned transportation enterprises should eliminate redundant personnel and tighten expenditures. The organization should be restored to pre-war standards.

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] Legislative Yuan members Huang Tong and others proposed to quickly stop the conscription and grain requisition cases. The Internal Affairs and Local Autonomy Committee, the National Defense Committee, and the Grain Administration Committee have each recommended five members, with Yang Yifeng as the convener, and are scheduled to meet at 9:00 AM on the 17th to review the matter.

### The Supervisory Yuan Will Provide Opinions on the New Cabinet

Yu Youren Will Host a Banquet for He Yingqin in the Coming Days

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] The Supervisory Yuan is concerned about the policy guidelines and cabinet member candidates of the He Yingqin cabinet. At the annual meeting on the 16th, committee members Chen Yunge and 19 others proposed an emergency motion requesting to change the agenda and conduct a political review in order to provide opinions on the policy guidelines and cabinet member candidates of the He cabinet. After discussion, it was believed that since the He cabinet has not yet been formed, the Supervisory Yuan can only express its opinions in a personal way. The final decision was that Yuan Wei Yu would host a banquet for Mr. He in a day or two, inviting some Supervisory Committee members to accompany him. During the banquet, the Supervisory Committee members would separately provide opinions to Premier He on the policy guidelines and cabinet member candidates.

### Two Supervisory Committee Members Refute Zhang Zhaoyuan's Remarks on the Lan Ni Dyestuff Case; Saying They Are Collecting Evidence and Will Propose an Impeachment

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] After Zhang Zhaoyuan, Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling Enemy and Puppet Property, made remarks in Shanghai regarding the Lan Ni dyestuff case, the original proposers of the case, Supervisory Committee members Xiong Zaiwei and Jin Yueguang, believed that Zhang's remarks were clearly intended to protect the Lan case. They are currently collecting evidence and will propose an impeachment against Zhang. The two men also met with reporters on the 16th and issued the following statement: The whole story has been detailed in the report, and the evidence is conclusive, so there is no need to argue. However, (1) The confiscated dyestuffs were the dyestuffs of Le Runting of the Welfare Company, which is proven by the warehouse receipt and has nothing to do with Ms. Lan, let alone the issue of whether she is a traitor prepared by the Ministry of Justice. The so-called owner, Ms. Lan, is clearly not a fact. (2) Le Runting is the holder of the warehouse receipt, and the warehouse receipt also states the words Le Runting. Even his repeated confessions have not involved any relationship with Ms. Lan. Moreover, the confiscated dyestuffs are vulcanized yellow and indigo, but Ms. Lan's application for return repeatedly claimed that they were indanthrene indigo blue, which are not only different in type, but also differ in price by a hundred times. Whether the dyestuffs are enemy and puppet property is one thing, but there is no doubt that they do not belong to Lan Ni. (3) The so-called "not a single penny has been returned" is because after the case reached Shanghai, public opinion was in an uproar, and the Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Anhui Cleaning Bureau for Handling Enemy and Puppet Property did not dare to make a decision rashly. It was also caused by the fact that I asked them to postpone the return during the investigation. However, this is not related to the establishment of Sun Ke's illegal misconduct in handling the case. As for the fact that the Executive Yuan's Committee for Handling Enemy and Puppet Property took the President's instructions and made illegal resolutions, a telegram was sent to the Guangzhou Executive Office to transfer the files. According to the reply from the Executive Yuan, the files are still in Nanjing, and there is no fixed office in Nanjing. The chairman of the committee, Zhang Zhaoyuan, sometimes disperses to Guangdong, sometimes hosts banquets in Nanjing, and sometimes makes remarks in Shanghai. His whereabouts are uncertain, and there is no way to inquire. Therefore, the relevant parts of the committee have not yet been closed. However, the relationship between the official and Sun Ke and Lan Ni is well known to everyone. He is flattering women and helping tyrants, and he is already unable to escape legal sanctions. Now, he does not hesitate to fabricate facts and protect them, which is even more shameful. I am currently proposing an impeachment.

### Lan Yezhen Issues a Statement

[This City News] According to Ms. Lan Caizhen, the person concerned in the dyestuff case: I have investigated that the Enemy and Puppet Property Cleaning Office seized 84 barrels of my dyestuffs, which I purchased in August 1945 and have a warehouse receipt as proof, and there are also witnesses to testify. After the victory, I registered according to law. According to Shanghai business customs, whoever holds the warehouse receipt for goods is the legal owner of the goods. If the Cleaning Office believes that these dyestuffs do not belong to me, why has it not produced any counter-evidence? Since I am the legal owner of the dyestuffs, I immediately requested that they be unsealed and returned when the Cleaning Office seized them. For three years, I have been constantly trying to do so. However, the government has been reorganized many times, and the matter has been delayed. As a result, I have not yet received the government's approval for return, nor have I received a penny of return. The material and spiritual losses I have suffered are enormous, which is very regrettable. If the government does not give this case a fair hearing, I will have to resort to legal means to seek relief.

### For the Relief Fund for Ai Bei; Liu Zheji Performs a Martial Arts Drama

Accusing Female Supervisory Committee Member Cui Shuyan of Embezzlement

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 16th Dispatch] After the adjournment of the Supervisory Yuan meeting at noon on the 16th, Vice President Liu Zheji staged another martial arts drama of beating people. At that time, Liu was talking with female Supervisory Committee member Cui Shuyan about the Northeast Relief Fund in front of the meeting venue. He mentioned that the National General Association for Comfort during the Battle of Xuzhou had given 1 million yuan to the Supervisory Yuan for distribution. The funds were handled by Cui Shuyan. Liu said that Cui had embezzled them. Cui argued with him. Liu angrily tried to hit Cui with his cane. Fortunately, female Supervisory Committee member Song Ying and others were present and quickly dissuaded him and helped Cui into Liu's car and drove away quickly. Liu had no choice but to leave the Yuan in another jeep. At the afternoon meeting, female Supervisory Committee members such as Song Ying wanted to propose a temporary motion, accusing Liu of insulting committee members and beating people again, and asking all the committee members to comment. However, they were dissuaded by many people.

### Editorial: Curbing Unrestrained Price Hikes in the Transportation Sector

The recent price increases in state-run railways, postal services, and telecommunications, which took effect on the 11th of this month, have had a significant and heavy impact on public sentiment and the market. The legislators currently meeting in Nanjing consider the unrestrained price hikes in railways, postal services, and telecommunications to be unreasonable and immediately convened a meeting to resolve not to recognize them, and requested the Executive Yuan to restrain them. During the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 14th, over a hundred legislators, including Niu Jianchu, proposed an emergency motion, "To restrain the price increases in the transportation sector, which the Executive Yuan has not yet implemented, and propose to take effective measures," which was submitted for discussion on the 15th. According to Legislator Niu, price increases in the transportation sector have rarely been discussed in the Legislative Yuan in the past and have always been presented as fait accompli. The last time the Legislative Yuan passed a motion to restrain price increases in the transportation sector, the Ministry of Transportation was restrained by you; as soon as the price increase occurred, he immediately telephoned the Minister of Transportation to report to the Legislative Yuan why he had not received the resolution of the Legislative Yuan to restrain price increases; (2) he then consulted the Executive Yuan to immediately revoke the recently announced train and postal prices of the Ministry of Transportation. The legislators unanimously agreed with the proposal and decided to change it into a question-and-answer session, which means that they want to investigate the responsibility for the price increases in the transportation sector from a legal and administrative point of view; but recalling the fact that it is constituted, they have to let it increase the price freely. If so, then this precedent is set, and in the future, you can ask questions as you like, and I will increase the price as I like. What can the Legislative Yuan do?

Railways, postal services, and telecommunications belong to the state-run transportation sector. From the perspective of its relationship with people's lives and social functions, it is a public utility, like urban water, electricity, and gas. This kind of public utility must be exclusively owned by the state, not a state patent. All activities related to it and its price increases and decreases must be subject to state and local control to prevent the public utility monopoly from becoming a private monopoly; and to avoid the public patent from becoming a private patent, which would completely lose the effectiveness of the public utility. In the years since the war, various public utilities have been affected by price fluctuations and high raw material prices, and there have been unrestrained price increase measures. Each price increase inevitably affects the rise of general prices. Although public utility operators and public administrative agencies explain the price increases of public utilities as being compelled by circumstances, public opinion does not forgive this explanation. From the perspective of facts and theory, it is inherently unforgivable.

However, like this time's price increases in state-run transportation, public opinion has expressed indignation, legislators have raised questions, and supervisory committee members are preparing to impeach, because its unrestrained price increases are based on unreasonableness, and of course, it must bear the opposition of society and the impeachment of the Legislative Yuan. Why is it said to be unreasonable? The reasons are no more than three points: (1) The transportation sector is a monopoly enterprise related to social welfare. This monopoly enterprise aims to facilitate the people, invigorate transportation, and communicate culture. It is a public utility that is publicly owned and publicly needed. Its price should not be used as a means of monopoly or for the purpose of profit. Even if there is a considerable loss, the state should provide legitimate subsidies and should not pass this loss on to the people. (2) If a price increase is necessary, in legal procedures, according to Article 20 of the "State-Owned Enterprise Management Law," the price increase proposal should be submitted to the legislative process to obtain legal support. The Legislative Yuan does not completely oppose price increases. As long as it takes into account the affordability of the public and increases the price moderately in a fair and progressive manner, the purpose of the price increase can be achieved. (3) Currently, the efficiency of general public utilities is too low, there are too many employees, expenses are too high, accounting has never been supervised, and management skills are also lacking. It should be thoroughly improved, redundant personnel should be cut, expenses should be reduced, and revenue and expenditure should be balanced. These three reasons are not only about the management policy of public utilities but also about general socio-economic policies.

This time's price increases in the state-run transportation sector seem to have constituted a fait accompli. Although the Legislative Yuan has vehemently opposed it, it is feared that the recently announced new prices cannot be revoked. The question now is how to seek rationalization of management and curb price increases in the transportation sector from active facilities, which is more in line with the requirements of reality. The transportation sectors of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are all monopolies, and their national transportation sectors' code of ethics aims at social service. Their management is scientific and rational, and the people have no complaints, and the government can govern with ease, without hurting each other's brains. Why are their people so happy? This is because they have a democratic and progressive government, and the socio-economic policies implemented by this government emphasize management and efficiency, so the transportation sector and all public utilities can meet scientific and rational standards.

Now, President He's organization of the new cabinet is about to be completed. He has always paid close attention to transportation management and has had brilliant achievements in managing military transportation during the Anti-Japanese War. Therefore, we hope that the He cabinet in the future, under the goals of political innovation and economic innovation, will focus on adjusting transportation and managing transportation, and strive to rationalize the management of state-run transportation and curb the unrestrained price increases in the transportation sector from active facilities!

### Communist Army in Southern Henan Continues to Advance Southward - National Army Retreats from Queshan and Luoshan - Communist Army in Su-Wan Border Region Assembles 300,000

[Report from our Newspaper, Xinyang, 16th] The National Army in southern Henan has taken strategic contingency measures to closely monitor the Chen Geng Corps advancing southward along the east side of the Pinghan Railway. According to military sources: Four divisions of the National Army and more than 100,000 local forces in Henan Province have completed new deployments on the line from Queshan in the north to Macheng in eastern Hubei on the 16th, and have also placed more than tens of thousands of local teams to maneuver in Zhumadian. Queshan, Zhengyang, and Luoshan echo each other from afar. According to this observation: The National Army took the initiative to withdraw from Luoshan (90 li from Xinyang) on the night of the 16th, and part of the National Army retreated from Queshan County to the suburbs today. In strategic deployment, it has great value. (2) News tonight: 4,000 Communist troops entered Luoshan. After the National Army took the initiative to withdraw from Queshan and Zhumadian north of Xinyang, the local Communist troops have taken the opportunity to act. A large army is now gathered in Xinyang, but the people are still at peace.

[Report from our Newspaper, Xinyang, 16th] The Fourth Corps of the Chen Geng Corps, about 10,000 people, advanced towards Zhengyang in three routes on the 15th. The First Security Brigade stationed in the city and reinforcements of the National Army, due to the disparity in numbers and the prominent terrain, had retreated to Minggang on the 16th. The external telecommunications of the city suddenly reported interruption this morning.

[Report from our Newspaper, Xinyang, 16th] The Liu Bocheng Corps and the Chen Geng Corps, with more than 20,000 troops, advancing southeast from Runan, continued to have a contingent of about 15,000 people arrive in Huangchuan on the morning of the 16th.

[Report from our Newspaper, Nanjing, 16th] Qualified sources pointed out that the nineteen columns of Chen Yi's troops are currently stationed on the north bank of the Yangtze River in the Jiangsu-Anhui border area, providing a huge political capital that can immediately change the situation in the Baoma negotiations. This political stake has been advancing slowly in the winter mud in northern Jiangsu for two months, regardless of wind and rain, and has been bet on the lines of Jingjiang and Wuwei and counties. In recent days, domestic and foreign news agencies have reported that the National Army bridgehead ports such as Yizheng near Jiangbei have been harassed by Communist troops. In fact, before and during the peace talks, the Communist troops would not attack the National Army bridgehead in Jiangbei. For the sake of their political strategy of "solving Beijing and Shanghai cannot solve China," although the situation of crossing the river has been formed, it must also wait for the peace talks to proceed and solve the situation afterwards. Therefore, the stationing of 300,000 troops, plus a total of about 460,000 local Communist troops, on the north bank can be said to have formed a "drinking horses on the Yangtze River" posture.

### Director of the Political Warfare Department of the Shanghai Garrison Command Discusses Recent Developments of the Communist Army in Northern Jiangsu

Recently, they have been actively preparing for a river-crossing offensive, but have not yet formed an attack posture. The dynamics are as follows: (1) The number of vehicles heading south on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway has increased significantly, and military transport is extremely busy. (2) Rush to repair the Dachang to Yizheng highway for military use. (3) Actively launch a military recruitment campaign near Liuhe. Those over 45 years old and under 60 years old are organized into the first team, those over 30 years old and under 45 years old are organized into the second team, and those under 30 years old are organized into the third team. It is planned that when crossing the river in the future, the first team will carry straw, the second team will each carry two hand grenades, and the third team will carry guns, first crossing by small wooden boats, and then followed by the main force of the regular army. (4) Chen Yi's troops are actively reorganizing and replenishing in Laian, Liuhe, Tianchang, Xuyi, and other places on the Jinpu Railway, and ordered the counties to urgently raise 72,000 dan of military rice and 36,000 dan of straw, and designated to transport them to the vicinity of Liuhe Leiguanji for storage. Now, the local villagers are delivering them in an endless stream. (5) Rush to build iron-clad warships, hand grenades, and set up intelligence networks along the river station, and step up the recruitment of soldiers and food, but euphemistically call it "joining the army" and "donating military food."

It is heard that since the troops withdrew from Yuanling City, there has been infighting, and on the evening of the 14th, they even killed each other, fighting for two hours. A certain authoritative person here analyzed the reasons for the infighting: (1) After the Yuanling Incident, Wang Yuanhua and Cao Zhenya were promoted and made a fortune, while their subordinates had nothing to gain. Among them, Cao Zixi, who was originally the captain of the security police team, was transferred to battalion commander after the rebellion and was quite dissatisfied. (2) The troops of Wang and Cao were originally a motley crowd. After occupying Yuanling City, they raped, plundered, and gained a lot. Now that they have withdrawn from Yuanling City and been reorganized into regular troops, they are mostly planning to "scatter like birds and beasts." In addition, the rebels suffered more than 800 casualties in the attack on Yuanling this time. Wang and others initially called on the rebels to enter Yuanling to make a fortune. Now, the families of the deceased have demanded their husbands and sons because they have not made a fortune but have died. Wang and Cao are quite embarrassed by this.

### To Support Farmland Irrigation and Water Conservancy: The Rural Reconstruction Commission Formulates Loan Principles. Jiang Menglin Hopes for Cooperation from Provincial主管 Institutions

[Central News Agency Guangzhou 16th Dispatch] The Chinese Rural Reconstruction Joint Committee has recently spared no effort in assisting in the advancement of farmland irrigation and water conservancy projects in Sichuan, Hunan, and Guangdong provinces. According to Committee Member Jiang Linlin, promoting farmland irrigation and water conservancy work is one of the committee's main tasks. In order to make the benefits widespread and to ensure the smooth development of this work, it is hoped that the主管 institutions of various provinces can cooperate closely with the committee.

### Portugal Participates in the Atlantic Pact: Preliminary Negotiations Have Been Completed. The United States Guarantees That It Will Never Use the Azores Base in Peacetime. The Full Text of the Draft Convention Is Scheduled to Be Released Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper News] Washington 16th Broadcast: Icelandic Foreign Minister Benediktsson and his delegation will meet with Acheson on the afternoon of the 16th for a final meeting before returning home. Mr. Benediktsson plans to take the train to New York at noon on the 17th and is scheduled to lead the delegation back to Iceland by plane next Sunday.

[Reuters Washington 16th Dispatch] The Portuguese Embassy in the United States has confirmed that when the Portuguese government discussed Portugal's participation in the Atlantic Pact with the United States, it stated that Portugal could be invited to participate in the Atlantic Pact on the sole condition that it would not borrow military bases from Portugal in peacetime. People close to the Portuguese Embassy also said that the State Department admitted that Portugal's reservation was acceptable. It is said that what Portugal is most concerned about is the Azores Islands, which have an important position in the defense of the Atlantic. The Azores are an important stopover point for air transportation between the two sides of the Atlantic. Portugal hopes that commercial aviation passing through the area will not be interfered with unless absolutely necessary. State Department officials also revealed that the preliminary negotiations for Portugal's participation in the Atlantic Pact have been extremely smooth, so the Portuguese Foreign Minister is expected to come to Washington in early April to join the foreign ministers of the seven countries of the Atlantic Pact to sign the treaty on April 4, making Portugal one of the initiators of the treaty. US officials also said that because the Portuguese people are averse to communism, if the Portuguese government approves the treaty, public opinion will not oppose it.

[French News Agency Washington 15th Dispatch] The Portuguese Embassy in the United States issued a communique, emphasizing that what the Portuguese government had to urge all signatory countries to pay attention to was that the exclusion of Spain, Portugal's neighbor, from the treaty would weaken the position of the Iberian Peninsula and lose a strategically important link.

[Associated Press Washington 16th Dispatch] US officials said that once the Madrid government expands and reorganizes, Spain will undoubtedly be invited to join the Atlantic Pact. They also said that the treaty does not stipulate that Spain or Ireland is prohibited from joining.

[US News Agency Washington 15th Dispatch] The representatives of the eight countries negotiating the draft North Atlantic Treaty concluded their scheduled meetings tonight. The full text of the treaty will be released at 4:00 PM on Friday (Greenwich Mean Time, midnight on the same day in Shanghai).

[Reuters London 15th Dispatch] British Foreign Secretary Bevin will arrive in the United States around March 31, and French Foreign Minister Schuman will fly to Washington on April 1 or 2 in order to sign the Atlantic Pact on April 4. The two will stay in the United States for about a week and will attend the opening ceremony of the United Nations General Assembly and discuss the general international situation with US authorities.

### Heated Congressional Debate on the Atlantic Pact: Italian Prime Minister Demands Vote of Confidence. Sforza Stresses That There Are No Secret Clauses

[Associated Press Rome 16th Dispatch] The Italian Parliament has concluded its debate on the Atlantic Pact in preparation for Prime Minister Gasperi's closing remarks on the afternoon of the 16th and a vote of confidence on Italy's negotiation to join the pact. Before requesting a vote of confidence from Parliament (which he is sure to obtain), Gasperi will likely speak for an hour.

[French News Agency Rome 16th Dispatch] The Italian Chamber of Deputies continued to debate the Atlantic Pact today. Left-wing Socialist Party member Basso vehemently opposed Italy's participation in the pact. He strongly stated that there was no need to fear Soviet aggression. The purpose of the Atlantic Pact is none other than to provide American merchants and soldiers with the means of war to achieve their goals. The debate will continue this afternoon.

[Reuters Rome 15th Dispatch] Italian Foreign Minister Sforza responded to questions from Communist Party members during the debate on the Atlantic Pact in the Chamber of Deputies today. He solemnly declared that the Atlantic Pact will never have secret clauses attached. He said that the Atlantic Pact was created because the United Nations was paralyzed due to the Soviet Union's repeated use of the veto power. Therefore, the Atlantic Pact was not created by the United States, but by the Soviet Union, which divided Europe. The Soviet Union already has agreements similar to spider webs with the Balkan countries, with Moscow as the center. Communists, like fascists, repeatedly state their lies in order to gain the trust of others. Those who oppose the Atlantic Pact are the same people who oppose the Marshall Plan and the European federal system. Their goal is to gradually establish a communist dictatorship in Western Europe. If we do not keep our doors open to facilitate Italy's joining the Atlantic Pact, we will be committing a great crime against Italy and peace. As for who wants war, it is certainly not the United Kingdom, which has spent half a century building socialism, it is certainly not France, which is extremely afraid of war, it is certainly not Belgium, which has been invaded by enemy cavalry twice, it is certainly not the Netherlands, which still has lingering fears, it is certainly not Luxembourg, which has only 600 gendarmes nationwide, and it is certainly not Italy, which is united against war. If the people inside the Communist Information Bureau had not threatened free and peaceful nations, the Atlantic Pact would not have been created at all. But I still believe that although the Soviet Union is willing to conquer other countries with the help of the Fifth Column, it is not willing to choose war.

### Soviet Government Reorganization: Enhancing Administrative Efficiency

Speculation on Whether There Are Other Backgrounds Is Divided

[United Press Washington 15th Dispatch] The recent changes in some ministers of the Soviet government have made US officials believe even more that the Kremlin is carrying out a Soviet-style "Hoover Plan." According to a recent announcement by Moscow Radio, three members of the Soviet Union's highest organ, the Politburo, have been relieved of their administrative duties, namely Molotov, who resigned as Foreign Minister, Mikoyan, who resigned as Minister of Foreign Trade, and Voznesensky, who resigned as Chairman of the State Planning Committee. This change is in line with the proposals of the government reorganization committee chaired by former US President Hoover. Hoover advocated expanding President Truman's power to decide foreign policy. US diplomatic authorities deeply believe that the Soviet Union's main purpose is also to strengthen the effectiveness of its highest political power, but opinions differ on whether there are other backgrounds for the reorganization.

### The New Economic Plan: Implementation Not Smooth

[French News Agency Washington 15th Dispatch] Political figures here believe that the Soviet Union's decision to remove Voznesensky from the position of Chairman of the State Planning Commission is sufficient to confirm the recent reports received by Washington that the implementation of the Soviet economic plan has been delayed and that the Soviet Union's new economic difficulties are increasing. US experts all believe that the Soviet economy cannot enable it to simultaneously complete its expansion plans for heavy industry and the arms industry while raising the living standards of the people. Soviet resources have always been considered inexhaustible and should be abundant, but in reality they are severely insufficient, and the results of nationwide planned surveys and investigations have greatly disappointed the government.

### Lee Beom-seok Points Out That the Jeju Island Rebels: Obtained Military Aid from the Soviet Union. More Than 400 Villages Have Been Occupied by Rebels

[New Asia Agency Seoul 16th Dispatch] South Korean Prime Minister Lee Beom-seok met with reporters at 10:00 AM today and expressed his thoughts after inspecting Jeju Island and the situation of the rebellion in the area: "Although the activities of the Jeju Island rebels are increasing day by day and the number of occupied villages has reached more than 400, the government forces have made all preparations and will definitely be able to completely wipe out the rebels. We recently discovered a North Korean submarine communicating with the rebels on the mountain in Morse code on the sea one kilometer away from the coast of Hallasan. It is speculated that the youth trained by North Korea use this as a landing point and then go to Hallasan and Jirisan to join the South Korean rebels and resist the government." At the same time, Minister of the Interior Yoon Chi-young issued a public announcement stating: "Jeju is mostly controlled by rebels. The authorities must pay attention to the villages not occupied by rebels, quickly provide material relief, and solve the people's problems of clothing, food, and housing, so as not to force the poor to take risks and cause great chaos."

[Central News Agency Seoul 15th Dispatch] Korean Prime Minister Lee Beom-seok said today that although the rebels in Jeju Island and South Jeolla Province have received Soviet support, they will still not be able to save themselves from being eliminated, and the rebels in South Korea will definitely be eliminated in the shortest possible time. Lee Beom-seok, who personally commanded the army in Jeju Island and South Jeolla Province, returned here and told reporters today that the Korean army had captured Soviet-made machine guns since attacking the red areas and captured the leaders of Soviet-trained guerrillas. Since February of this year, submarines and ships have frequently appeared on the island, which must be the Soviet Union supplying and replenishing the rebels with ammunition. Lee estimated that there were fewer than 300 armed rebels lurking on Jeju Island, and about 700 scattered in the mountains of South Jeolla Province.

### US Troops in South Korea: Still More Than 7,000 People

Soviet Troops Busy Mobilizing Along the Border

[Our Newspaper News] London 16th Broadcast: Recently, the Soviet Union countered by attacking and broadcasting criticism of the Iranian government, saying that it had lodged a strong protest against the Soviet Union's slanders and defamations. The spokesperson also suggested that Iran should immediately abolish the 1921 Iranian-Soviet Alliance Treaty and that the United States should sign a secret military alliance. Senior Foreign Ministry officials said that although the Soviet Union has not formally increased pressure on Iran, Soviet newspapers and radio stations have been criticizing it severely. They also said that Soviet border troops are mobilizing quite busily.

### Unmanned Aircraft Appear in the Black Night in Northern Italy

Dropping Ammunition with Parachutes

[Our Newspaper News] London 16th Broadcast: Rome News, for the past twenty days, unmanned aircraft have often appeared at night in the Modena area of northern Italy, and seem to be dropping ammunition and the like with parachutes. The aircraft mostly have no lighting equipment, and fly low regardless of flight rules.

### The Soviet Union Leads the Organization: The East European Military Alliance. Is Expected to Be Announced Soon

[Reuters Paris 16th Dispatch] The Paris Evening News claimed that on the day the Atlantic Pact is signed in Washington, the content of the East European Mutual Defense Pact can also be announced simultaneously in Moscow and the capitals of East European countries. The Evening News said that Soviet dignitaries, including Molotov, had traveled to the capitals of East European countries to negotiate the signing of the East European Mutual Defense Pact to counter the Atlantic Pact. Those participating in the East European Mutual Defense Pact are believed to be the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Albania. After the announcement of the treaty, the Communist Parties of France, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the Scandinavian countries will also follow suit with expressions of support. People here also believe that Molotov's resignation as Foreign Minister is so that he can devote his full energy to leading the East European United Front.

### The French Government Stands Firm: The De Gaulle Faction Is Dissatisfied with the Vietnam Policy. The Impeachment Case Is Rejected

[Reuters Paris 15th Dispatch] The French Chamber of Deputies today rejected the De Gaulle faction's Captain's motion to impeach the government for refusing to allow debate on the situation in Vietnam by a vote of 350 to 228. The filing of this impeachment case is the first in three years. Communist Party members expressed support for Captain's case, and another impeachment case filed by Communist Party member Duguqin was also discussed today. Duguqin demanded that the government quickly end the war in Vietnam and sign an agreement with Ho Chi Minh. During the debate, Duguqin accused the government of being war traffickers, and some members and deputies in attendance angrily walked out. After Duguqin finished speaking, they entered the venue and took their seats. Afterwards, the parliament finally decided to discuss the Communist Party's impeachment motion in November by a vote of 378 to 183, to show that the parliament did not want to be manipulated by one party or one member.

### Class A Japanese War Criminals: Will No Longer Be Prosecuted in the Future

The Far Eastern Commission Specifically Instructed MacArthur

[Reuters Washington 15th Dispatch] The Eleven-Nation Far Eastern Commission has instructed General MacArthur to no longer prosecute Japanese people accused of having planned, prepared, or instigated wars of aggression. This instruction makes it impossible for Japanese Emperor Hirohito to be prosecuted again as a war criminal. If Hirohito were to be prosecuted, he could only be dealt with as a Class A war criminal, and this instruction from the Far Eastern Commission has eliminated all prosecutions of Class A war criminals in Japan.

### Youngest Mom

Ten-Year-Old Black Girl Safely Gives Birth to a Female Infant

[Associated Press Wilmington, Delaware 15th Dispatch] According to officials at a local hospital, a 10-year-old black girl gave birth to a girl in the hospital on the 15th. The girl is the youngest mother in American history. The baby girl weighs 7 pounds and 5 ounces, and both mother and daughter are safe. But the father's name remains a secret.

### The Issue of Japanese Occupation Is Handed Over to Civilian Officials: The US Government Is Carefully Considering. If MacArthur Does Not Retire, He Will Be Responsible to the State Department

[United Press Washington 16th Dispatch] Diplomatic sources said today that the United States is seriously considering transferring the issue of Japanese occupation to civilian officials, which may be implemented next year. However, MacArthur or other senior military officers will still serve as commanders, and the current plan is based on this intention. Afterwards, MacArthur will be responsible to the State Department instead of the Department of the Army, and will have a civilian official to assist him in presiding over most of the administrative matters. The same idea is being studied in Germany as well. However, the authorities announced that no decision has been made on the changes in management in the two occupied areas, and even if a final decision is made, it will take several months to formulate all the details.

### The United Kingdom Actively Promotes the Plan: To Enhance the Combat Effectiveness of the Air Force. The Strength of the Soviet Union Is Strong and Should Not Be Underestimated

[Reuters London 16th Dispatch] Aviation Minister Henderson told the House of Commons that the United Kingdom has now begun to implement the first phase of the plan to increase the strength of its first-line bomber fleet. Mr. Henderson was reporting on the plans of the British Air Force when requesting the House of Commons to approve the Air Force budget of 207 million pounds for the next year, which is an increase of 34 million pounds over this year. Mr. Henderson also revealed that the work of converting the British Air Force's daytime combat fleet and overseas assault team to jet combat aircraft will be completed by June of next year. The Meteor and Vampire jet combat aircraft currently used by the British Air Force are the best aircraft in the world's current active air force, but the latest aircraft being researched by the United Kingdom are even better. We are confident that the British Air Force's current leading position in the world for daytime combat aircraft will continue to be maintained in the future. A twin-engine jet bomber with a speed of 500 miles per hour and a jet night combat aircraft are also being ordered by the government.

[Reuters Cincinnati 15th Dispatch] Jordan, chairman of the US Curtis Aircraft Company, claimed that the progress of the Soviet Air Force will seriously threaten the US's acquisition of air supremacy. He especially did not want to fly the first US Nie bomber to bomb the Soviet Union, because he might encounter a sky full of Soviet combat aircraft at that time. Mr. Jordan also said that Americans believe that aircraft can be mass-produced and can ascend to extremely high altitudes, but who knows if the Soviet Union cannot produce more aircraft and aircraft that ascend to higher altitudes.

### Karen Rebels Advance on Rangoon; Burmese Government Appeals to Britain and India; Admits Inability to Defend for Long, Requests Military Assistance from Both Countries

[Reuters, Rangoon, 16th] The Burmese government is reported to have urgently appealed to London and New Delhi for assistance in averting a crisis where it may have to completely yield to the Karen rebels. Through its ambassadors in Britain and India, the Burmese government has frankly informed the British and Indian governments that without foreign aid, it will be unable to quell the domestic rebellion. The telegram admits that the entire country of Burma, except for the area surrounding Rangoon, is under rebel control, and that the rebels surrounding Rangoon have completed preparations for an attack, while their fifth column is actively engaged in propaganda within the city of Rangoon. The urgent telegram also frankly admits that after the rebels launch a general offensive against Rangoon, the government forces will be unable to defend for long, inevitably leading to a complete state of chaos. The Burmese government requests that Britain and India quickly provide military equipment to assist the Burmese government, and also issues a statement recognizing the Burmese government as the leader of the entire country, while simultaneously condemning the Karen for launching a rebellion, to provide moral support to the Burmese government. According to recent frontline reports, after the Karen rebels occupied Mandalay, they have moved their main force southward, crossed the Irrawaddy River, and are advancing on Rangoon.

### Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu Appeals for Cooperation from Rebels

[Reuters, Rangoon, 15th] Twenty-four hours after the Burmese government proposed amnesty for the Karen natives, Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu broadcast to the Karen people, urging them to lay down their weapons and work together for the benefit of the country. Thakin Nu spoke in a very sincere tone, stating that he was not making this appeal in his capacity as Prime Minister, but as an ordinary citizen, whose only concern was the unity and unification of the country. He said that if the seventeen million Burmese compatriots continued to kill each other, the goal of Burma's independence would inevitably be lost. Finally, he earnestly hoped that everyone would forget the past, so that they could work together to save the new Burma.

### Desertion from Burmese Army Intensifying; Karen People Effectively Control the Country

### Important Resolutions of the Food Conference; Mayor Secures U.S. Agreement to Extend Rice Rationing to End of June; U.S. Aid Rice is Being Shipped to Shanghai

[Report from Our Newspaper] The regular meeting of the Municipal Food Conference was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in the auditorium of the Municipal Government. Representatives from relevant agencies such as the Food Department, the Public Opinion Research Association, and the Shanghai branch of the U.S. Economic Cooperation Administration, as well as Mayor Wu Kuo-chen, Zhang Bide, the Chief of Protocol of the Municipal Government, and more than ten others attended. After the meeting, reporters inquired with the attendees about the resolutions of the meeting, but they all kept their mouths shut, only saying that it was an ordinary regular meeting and that there were no concrete decisions made. However, according to inquiries from relevant sources by our reporter, it is definitely known that the meeting did have important resolutions. The rice rationing for households in this city is entirely supplied by U.S. aid. According to the contract stipulations, the distribution of this U.S. rice will expire at the end of this month, and supplies will no longer be provided in the future. Mayor Wu, believing that at this time of extreme difficulty, if household rice rationing were to stop, it would inevitably cause extreme panic over food, and the consequences would be unimaginable, argued forcefully at the meeting, hoping that the U.S. side would continue to provide assistance. It is now learned that this request has been agreed to by the U.S. side, and the supply of U.S. aid rice will be extended to the end of June of this year. As for after June, it will depend on whether the U.S. Congress passes an extension. In any case, the household rice in this city will definitely continue as usual before the end of June. It is also learned that the U.S. rice is currently being shipped to Shanghai, and there should be no concerns about the food supply in this city in the short term.

### Rumors of a Black Market Index; Bureau Chief of Social Affairs Declares It Inaccurate; Meeting to be Held Next Week to Discuss Technical Improvements

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the municipal government announced the cost of living index for mid-month to be 1339.36 times, rumors circulated that there was another black market index of 1642 times, causing dissatisfaction among labor unions. Yesterday, reporters inquired with Cao Peizi, the Bureau Chief of Social Affairs, who stated that the index statistics are absolutely scientific, and that representatives from both labor and management participate in the index meeting, making it impossible to arbitrarily alter the index. The rumors are therefore unreliable. In order to be more thorough, the Social Affairs Bureau will convene a cost of living index review meeting next week, inviting relevant parties to discuss technical improvements. Further inquiries were made as to whether the large advertisements published by Xiang Gui toothpaste, offering ten taels of gold as a prize for guessing the cost of living index to be announced by the Shanghai Municipal Government on May 16, would affect the confidentiality of compiling the cost of living index. Cao stated that publishing advertisements is a matter of freedom, and there is no legal basis to prohibit it, but he hopes that the media can automatically restrain it. Regarding the request from the barber and bathhouse industries to adjust the base number, Bureau Chief Cao instructed the two industries to draft base numbers for each level within three days, pending verification by the Social Affairs Bureau.

### Leaders of the General Labor Union Visited the Bureau Chief of Social Affairs Yesterday; Inquired About Joint Liability in Labor Disputes

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhou Xuexiang, the chairman of the General Labor Union, along with directors Ye Xianggao and Fang Rusheng, visited Bureau Chief Cao at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday. Regarding the six measures for handling labor disputes promulgated by the Garrison Command a few days ago, which stipulated that the chairman of the labor union should bear joint liability if a labor dispute occurs, they believed that this responsibility was too great, and that in the future, the chairman of each labor union would be in constant fear. They requested that the Social Affairs Bureau provide protection. Bureau Chief Cao stated that regarding this matter, the Garrison Command's measures for handling labor disputes would have detailed explanations in addition to the clauses. He believed that joint liability referred to suspicion of inciting labor disputes, or standing by and watching when labor disputes occur. Assisting the government in preventing the occurrence of labor disputes would definitely not lead to implication. Zhou Xuexiang and others also raised the issue that finished products from steel refining enterprises were being sealed by military agencies, which would result in 8,000 workers losing their jobs. They requested that the authorities quickly find a solution. Cao stated that this matter had been discussed with the military agencies and that the products would be returned soon, so the resumption of operations would not be a problem.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company New and Old General Managers Held Handover Ceremony Yesterday Morning; Hu Shiyuan Announced Ten Points of Policy

Guests from all walks of life, Yu Feipeng, Xu Enzeng, Wei Wenhan, Li Yunliang, Zhong Shandao, Shen Qi, and former Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company, Liu Hongsheng, as well as hundreds of employees, attended.

At the beginning of the handover ceremony, Chairman Xu first gave a speech.

Then, Chairman Xu personally handed the seal of office to General Manager Hu. After receiving the seal, Hu delivered an impromptu speech, stating briefly that the policy for the future would be based on the following ten points: (1) A portion of the shares of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company belong to private ownership, but the majority of the shares are still state-owned. In the future, under the principle of thorough commercialization, we must still do our best to carry out the tasks assigned to us by the government. (2) Because a portion of the shares of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are privately owned, the interests of the private shareholders must be taken into account. (3) We will do our best to handle military and public transportation, and we cannot refuse. (4) In order to take into account the interests of the private shareholders, we must pay special attention to the profits of the business. (5) We will try to reduce expenses as much as possible and increase revenue. (6) Reducing expenses and increasing revenue requires a deep understanding of this and a determination and perseverance to implement it, both internally and externally, from top to bottom, in order to achieve results. (7) We will no longer add new people. We can only start from the coordination of people and things, and adjust the current staff as much as possible based on the needs of the work and the individual's talents. (8) I hope that all colleagues will do their best to promote their spirit of service. (9) I hope that all colleagues will be open and honest and cooperate fully. (10) My personal vision and hearing are limited, and my thinking is lacking. I urge knowledgeable people from all walks of life to give as much guidance as possible on various matters that the Bureau should promote and reform, as far as their vision and hearing can reach.

### Swindled Nearly Ten Million in Deposits; More Than 30 Victimized Stores; Owner of China Underwear Factory Arrested and Tried

[Report from Our Newspaper] Sun Tiande, a native of Ningbo, opened the China Underwear Factory at 176 Jia Le Road in this city, producing Jianmei brand cotton undershirts and pants. In December of last year, taking advantage of the opportunity when the department stores in this city were running out of stock during the rush period, he promoted the factory's products to the various department stores and accepted large cash orders. However, on January 15 of this year, Sun Tiande suddenly fled without a trace. The various stores that had placed orders rushed to the factory to investigate upon hearing the news, only to find that Sun had moved away the important machinery and materials, and no one came forward to take responsibility, so they reported to the police station. After the court opened hearings twice to summon the defendant, the defendant ignored them, so an arrest warrant was issued. Based on a tip-off on the evening before last, Sun had returned to the factory, so the bailiffs arrested him and brought him to court. Yesterday afternoon, the court held a hearing. The plaintiffs, who were department stores, sent representatives from Tianyuanxiang, Hengfeng, and Qingnian No. 3 to the court. It is heard that this is the largest fraud case in Shanghai in recent months, with more than 30 victimized stores and a sum of nearly ten million Gold Yuan.

### Peddling Stolen Goods Leads to Arrest; Confesses to Committing Seven Cases

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Xinchengying Branch Bureau recently received a tip-off that a batch of stolen watches and other items were being peddled to various commercial sites. Director Ding instructed Section Chief Hao to dispatch patrol officer Liu Yunhai, along with police officers Lu Yuheng and Dai Wende, to secretly investigate the commercial sites. At around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, at the New World Commercial Site on Nanjing Road, they found Li Jianzhong and Tao Zhiying selling a watch. Upon learning that it was stolen property, they arrested them on the spot and took them to the bureau for strict interrogation. According to their confession, there were three accomplices in total, and one person named Xiao Wu was still at large. They also confessed to committing seven robbery cases previously. Afterwards, a pistol and three bullets were found in the home of their friend Yang Fangsheng in a thatched shed on Meili Road and were taken to the bureau as evidence for investigation.

### Framing of Belgian Priest Case; Prosecution of Five Chinese and Foreign Criminals

[Report from Our Newspaper] The five Chinese and foreign defendants, Ai Gai, Keli Ke, Yi Lieci, Jimi, and Wang Xianzhang, who were accused of framing Father George Gemayel and extorting tens of thousands of U.S. dollars, were arrested by the police station at the end of last month. The case was sent to the District Prosecutor's Office, and prosecutor Xu Dingkan spent half a month investigating. It has now concluded, and the defendants have been prosecuted on charges of intimidation and fraud.

The indictment stated briefly that the above defendants have no permanent occupation and are extravagant in their daily lives. They are dishonest in their conduct and make a living by defrauding others of their property due to financial difficulties. Keli Ke had previously committed embezzlement and forgery of securities and was sentenced to one year in prison. After serving his sentence, he was released, but he continued to act recklessly. On October 20 of last year, Keli used a bad check for US$800 from the First Trust Company of America, colluding with accomplices to obtain US$200 from real estate developer Thomson. On November 17, Yi Lieci, taking advantage of his son's school attendance, tricked Bai Laoqi, the principal of the school, out of 2,450 Gold Yuan under the pretense of selling white sugar. On January 8 of this year, Keli and Yi stayed in a room at the Paramount Hotel for more than ten days and owed a considerable amount of room fees. They used a 10,000 Gold Yuan bad check from the Bank of Communications to stall. On the 10th, Yi met a Korean named Liang Zaiyi in a cafe, and he seized the opportunity to trick him out of two strings of necklaces and a bottle of brandy. Later, there were many cases of defrauding room fees by mortgaging bad checks at the YMCA. Finally, on the evening of the 22nd of the same month, he conspired with several accomplices to break into the home of Belgian priest George Gemayel at No. 7, Lane 135, Huashan Road, and, under the pretext of private foreign exchange trading, impersonated personnel from the Songhu Garrison Command and the Municipal Police Bureau. They searched the house at will, and Keli seized the opportunity when Qiao was unprepared and stuffed a piece of counterfeit opium, made by Wang Xianzhang, into the bookcase, and publicly searched out the original object, falsely claiming that Qiao was privately hiding opium, in an attempt to defraud him of US$50,000. Qiao was forced by coercion and gifted US$1,500 and a US$30,000 draft before they left. Afterwards, Qiao reported to the police based on information, and the criminals were arrested one after another. They were transferred for investigation and prosecution on charges of intimidation and fraud.

### Leaf Xinmin Summoned for Alleged Embezzlement Case; Rong Yiren Testifies That All Wheat Flour Ground on Behalf Has Been Delivered

[Report from Our Newspaper] The District Prosecutor's Office opened a second court hearing yesterday morning to investigate the major case of alleged embezzlement of 500,000 bags of wheat flour by Ye Xinmin, the director of the Shanghai General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food, and others. Ye Xinmin, after the first interrogation, left Shanghai on bail and did not appear in court yesterday. Only Rong Yiren, the manager of Fuxing Flour Mill, the second defendant in the case, and Qian Shouchun, a related person, appeared in court to respond to the inquiry. The District Prosecutor's Office refused to publicly release information because the case was still under investigation. However, it is learned that Rong testified in court yesterday that he had delivered all of the superior wheat flour ground on behalf of Ye Xinmin, which can be proven by Qian Shouchun. However, Ye denied receiving the wheat flour during the interrogation at the previous court hearing. As the main defendant in the case, Ye Xinmin, did not appear, the District Prosecutor's Office decided to pursue the original bail and summon him.

### Railroads, Post Office, and Telecommunications Continue to Charge New Rates Before Receiving Change Orders

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the railroads, post office, and telecommunications automatically adjusted their rates three times a month in accordance with the formula, the Legislative Yuan strongly opposed and rejected it. Reporters visited the Shanghai Post Office, Telecommunications Bureau, and Jinghu Railway Bureau yesterday to inquire. They were told that they could not change the charging standards without receiving change orders from the Ministry of Communications. Currently, the three bureaus are still charging according to the new rates adjusted from the 11th of this month.

Recently, this city has still received ordinary letters with only 25 yuan of postage stamps. The post office has not processed them as underpaid letters. However, the person in charge of the post office stated that all postage for various letters and packages is still charged according to the new prices from the 11th, which means that ordinary letters weighing less than 20 grams should have 15 yuan of postage stamps. As for the newly discovered ordinary letters with only 25 yuan of postage stamps, it may be a temporary "omission."

### Integrity and Probity of the Ninth Regiment of the Military Police; Voluntarily Returns Overpaid Fuel and Vegetables

The Military-Civilian Cooperation Association to Present a Banner

The procurement of non-staple food for the garrison troops in the Songhu area is currently handled by the Military-Civilian Cooperation Committee.

### City Government Publishes Advertisement Encouraging More Flour Consumption; 15,000 Tons of Flour in Storage, Prolonged Storage Will Likely Result in Losses

[Our Report] It is reported that the city government authorities, upon the suggestion of the Economic Cooperation Administration (ECA), have published advertisements in both Chinese and English newspapers to launch a "Eat More Flour Campaign." The background to this matter is understood as follows: In the past, American-aid flour was mostly used to supply North China. Since the Communist army swept through Peiping and Tianjin, the American-aid flour stored in Shanghai has reached as much as 15,000 tons, enough to supply the city's five million residents with five catties (approximately 2.5 kg) per person for ten days. Because flour is easily damaged if stored for a long time, the ECA is eager to distribute and sell it as soon as possible. Therefore, starting from February of this year, flour was distributed in addition to rice rations. However, southerners are accustomed to eating rice, and the number of people buying flour accounts for only about five percent. According to the number of North China residents living in this city, it accounts for about fifteen percent. In common sense, they should like to eat flour, but the result is the opposite. They believe that rice is easier to preserve than flour, the selling price is cheaper, and that it is more nutritious, so most also abandon flour for rice. The ECA has no other solution, so it consulted with the city government to use advertisements to urge citizens to voluntarily eat more rationed flour. However, according to sources, if this campaign is not effective, it may be implemented that only flour will be distributed without rice on certain ration days. It will be distributed in three phases each month, with five catties of flour per person per phase. There is precedent for this matter. That is, when the price limit was cancelled last October, there was a severe rice shortage in this city. At that time, all rations were flour, and the selling price was even above the market price.

### New Scam Appears in Shanghai: Friends Riding in Cars Beware of Being Deceived; Intentionally Tearing Uniform to Demand Compensation - Security Authorities Should Pay Attention to Investigation

[Our Report] As endless crimes adorn this bustling international city, a new scam has recently appeared in Shanghai, unique and specifically targeting the car-owning class. A week ago, an American lady named Mrs. Carter, along with two friends, came out from the Petain Apartments and drove a car. Not long after the car drove, they suddenly noticed a person wearing an empty car uniform intentionally bumped the back of her car and immediately ordered her to stop. The person then ran up, accompanied by two other people in the same uniform. One of them spoke English and warned Mrs. Carter, "You tore my friend's clothes, you must immediately compensate for the loss of 70,000 yuan." Mrs. Carter was shocked at the time. Looking back, there was indeed a big hole in the sleeve of the man's right arm. Was this caused by Mrs. Carter's car? - It was raining at that time, of course the man was wet all over, but on closer inspection, the cloth he was holding that had been torn was completely dry, so undoubtedly this was a pre-arranged scam. So Mrs. Carter replied at the time: "I can pay you money, but this money must be handed directly to the Garrison Headquarters. Please show me your name and affiliated organization." After Mrs. Carter finished speaking, she immediately called to notify the Garrison Department. At this moment, the three people disappeared at the same time.

The above incident occurred at 3:15 pm on the 10th of this month. Afterwards, Mrs. Carter wrote a letter to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury*, describing the illegal soldier in detail - five feet four inches tall, broad-shouldered, wearing brown sunglasses, wearing an air force hat, wearing a green khaki uniform, with wool lining, and a handgun hidden in the outer garment. The torn hole used for blackmail was on the left upper arm about four inches from the elbow.

It was only four days after Mrs. Carter's letter was published in the *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* that the same incident appeared again. - At 9:45 last night, a reader of this newspaper drove through the Huajin Lane area of Sanma Road and found three soldiers coming towards them, refusing to give way in a grand manner. In this way, the speed of the car had to slow down. As the car approached, the three people slightly dodged to both sides of the road, leaving only enough space for the width of a car. When the driver carefully and cautiously passed through as if taking a driving test, one of them bumped the car door with his right arm and ordered him to stop, at which time the three of them swarmed up, saying that the car had torn his clothes, and showed his watch, saying that the watch was also broken, forcing him to pay compensation. But at first glance, the watch was still running and was not damaged. It was indeed a piece torn from the clothes on the right arm, but this broken part was higher than the car door and could not be touched by any part of the car, so it was not difficult to determine that this was the same scam. After this reader informed the newspaper of the incident, the reporter believed that it was necessary to record it. On the one hand, to report the endless emergence of new scams in this city, hoping that citizens will be vigilant. On the other hand, it is also hoped that the security authorities will pay attention to this. If they do not find a way to ban it, even the freedom of ordinary citizens to walk will be deprived.

### "Amber" Director Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong; Plans to Film in Hong Kong with Hong Kong as the Background; Hires Chinese Actress for Role

[Our Report] Otto Preminger, the director and producer of the American 20th Century Fox film "Amber," accompanied by screenwriter Pillip Dunne, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon from Hong Kong on a Pan American Airways flight, arriving at Longhua at 6:50 pm and staying at the Cathay Hotel. Also accompanying them were the Chinese playwright Yao Ke and his wife. Preminger recently plans to shoot a new film set in Hong Kong, so he specially took his screenwriter to Hong Kong for inspection. They stayed in Hong Kong for about two weeks and visited the Yonghua Film Company and met with several Chinese movie stars. It is reported that Tyrone Power will be the protagonist in his new film, and a Chinese actress will be cast as a supporting role. It is said that he is very interested in Chen Yunshang. (According to reports, Chen is now living in seclusion in Hong Kong with her husband, Dr. Tang, and has given birth to a daughter.) However, Preminger did not confirm this yesterday. He said that the content and title of the new film have not yet been decided. They are currently only here to observe whether Hong Kong can be used as a background. He criticized the Hong Kong film industry, saying: Although the scale is small, the equipment is quite modern. It is reported that he will sign a contract with Yonghua to cooperate in the future filming of the new film. They will stay in Shanghai for two days and then return to the United States via Tokyo. Preminger's works that have been shown in this city include "Fallen Angel," "Laura," "Centennial Summer," and "Forever Amber." The new work "Centennial Summer" will soon be released in the Cathay and Carlton theaters. Pillip Dunne is a famous screenwriter, and the screenplay for "How Green Was My Valley," which won an Academy Award, is Dunne's representative work.

### City God Temple Armed Brawl Case; Gang Leader Sneaks Back to Shanghai; Hiding Among Silver Dealers; Arrested Near Old North Gate

Soon after, the person in uniform returned with more than ten people and destroyed all the glass doors and windows of the theatre. They also beat the manager Xu Suqi and the cashier. After receiving the report, the police station sent personnel to rush to the scene, but they had already left. The investigation is still underway.

### Sunk in Zhejiang Sea, Floated to Japan; Body from the Taiping Steamer Recovered off Nagasaki Port

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] After the Taiping steamer sank off the coast of Zhejiang a month ago, the floating corpse of a passenger drifted to the outside of Nagasaki Port and was recovered by a Japanese fisherman. His identity card was issued by the Tianjin Police Department. The name was Yuan Jiaqiu, 30 years old, from Xiangcheng, Henan. He graduated from St. John's University in Shanghai and worked for a certain railway bureau. According to his ticket, he was traveling to Keelung in first class on that day. According to the Taiping Steamer sank at the end of January, and the corpse drifted for several weeks before being recovered by the crew of the Akashi Maru off the Goto Islands near Nagasaki on February 20.

### Fudan Students Go Out to Promote: Organize a College Student Union; Police Department Sends Police Cars to Discourage After Hearing the News

[Our Report] The Anti-Survival Committee organized by Jiaotong University students will hold a complaint meeting at the school tonight.

The Fudan University Faculty, Staff, Employee, Police, and Student Anti-Survival Committee was officially established on the afternoon of the 15th. Representatives from lecturers, teaching assistants, staff, workers, and students all participated. The Professors' Association adopted a reserved attitude and did not send representatives to attend. Currently, other units are trying to win the participation of professors. On the evening of the 15th, the school's students held an anti-survival complaint meeting at Deng Hui Hall. More than 1,000 teachers, students, employees, police, and classmates attended. It was decided to contact other schools in Shanghai to organize the Shanghai National College Student Friendship Association, and issue a letter to the public, requesting the government to: (1) All students receive public funding. (2) The salaries of faculty, staff, and police and the public funding for students are calculated based on the base salary multiplied by the price index. (3) Increase the school's regular expenses. Yesterday morning, more than 800 students from the school went to Tongji, Shanghai Business and other schools to carry out publicity and liaison work. After hearing the news, the Garrison Command sent police cars to discourage them, and no accidents occurred.

### Presidents of National Colleges and Universities Agreed on the Amount of Overdraft Funding

[Our Report] The presidents of the national colleges and universities in this city met at noon yesterday to discuss the calculation method for overdrafting school funds from national banks. It was decided that the amount of the overdraft would be the total amount of living allowances and student meal expenses. However, because the central government has not yet determined the multiple standard for living allowances, etc., the overdraft from national banks will be temporarily calculated based on the current 225 times. In addition, it was also decided to telegraph the Ministry of Education in Guangzhou, requesting that the funds to be reissued this month and the amount to be prepaid next month be notified to the National Treasury Department as soon as possible for preparation.

According to Fudan University President Zhang Xiang said to reporters: The measures for adjusting the treatment of public officials announced by the Executive Yuan stipulate that it should be calculated based on the cost of living index of civil servants. This index varies from region to region and is no different from the cost of living index of local workers. In order to compile this civil servant index, the government will need to collect data from various regions. After the index is announced, it will then notify the National Treasury Department to issue payment vouchers. After going through various procedures, it is estimated that the earliest time to receive the reissued amount will be on the 10th of next month, and the devaluation loss will be very large. Therefore, he believes that this method of calculating salaries based on the civil servant index has many technical difficulties in implementation. He hopes that the government can pay attention to it so as not to cause devaluation losses to various public officials.

### English Speech Contest to be Held on April 30

[Our Report] The Preparatory Committee decided at a meeting at Jiaotong University yesterday afternoon that the English speech contest for students from public and private colleges and universities in this city will be held on April 30. Each school will select one representative to participate.

### Professor Salary Issue: Expecting New Cabinet to Resolve

[Our Report] The Shanghai National College and University Professors' Association recently held a meeting and decided that the 500 times salary that has been issued is only recognized as the amount reissued for February, and requested that the presidents of each school rush to issue the March salary, calculated by multiplying the original salary by the price index without discount. At noon yesterday, the presidents of the national colleges and universities met and discussed this. The presidents had already forwarded the professors' request to calculate salaries based on the price index, along with the requests of staff to strive for further study expenses and self-funded students to strive for public funding, to the Ministry of Education. The presidents believe that this is a whole treatment issue. However, taking March as an example, there is a huge gap between the professors' requirements and the multiple stipulated by the government. It seems that this issue still needs to be resolved after the establishment of the new cabinet. The presidents of each school all hope to seek a solution as soon as possible.

### Plotting to Rob, Exposed and Arrested; Five Thieves All Caught; Confessing to Six Cases

[Our Report] The Detective Section of the Police Station recently received a report that five robbers, Qu Genlin, Chen Gesheng, Gan Lixi, Wang Yecai, and Yang Yugao, planned to go to the residence of Gao Linfa, general manager of Likang Box Factory at No. 5, Lane 174, Kangding Road, at 7 pm on the 13th of this month. They also learned that the bandits first opened room 312 at the New World Hotel on Nanjing West Road as a place to gather, discuss, and store guns. The section chief Gan personally planned the case-breaking steps.

At about 5 pm, Chen and Wang gathered in the room, carrying a fast-slow machine gun and three handguns, hidden on the top of the cupboard.

### Peiping Style (5)

— Jiang Xue

Report on a City Before and After "Partial Peace"

(5) Social Phenomena After Peace

Slogans such as "Confiscate Bureaucratic Capital," "Protect National Industry and Commerce," and "Develop Production, Prosper the Economy, Take into Account Both Public and Private Interests, Benefit Both Labor and Capital" appeared in Peiping after liberation. This was undoubtedly a reassurance for ordinary citizens and industrialists, reducing their many anxieties. In fact, after the Chinese Communists entered the city, there were too many state-owned enterprises and materials. Concentrating all their efforts on receiving them was still not easy. They had no time to care about private enterprises and general industry and commerce. What kind of policies will the Chinese Communists adopt for private enterprises and general industry and commerce after state-owned enterprises and bureaucratic capital are taken over in the future? In many places, the division between bureaucratic capital and private enterprises is ambiguous and very flexible! How to accurately divide them? These are all problems.

However, judging from the current situation, since the Communist army entered the city, the atmosphere among ordinary citizens has gradually changed. Everyone's clothes and attire must be worn out to look poor. In the past, modern girls who wore fur coats and plush coats also changed to ordinary woolen coats to avoid unnecessary accidents and disputes. In the development of general industry and commerce, only daily necessities such as oil, salt, flour, miscellaneous grains...etc., because they are indispensable, there is still business to be done. Other businesses such as silk and satin shops, woolen shops, Western clothing shops, department stores...etc., have become so deserted that there is almost no business! The shops in Wangfujing Street are deserted and abnormally depressed. Few people go to patronize them. Other industrial companies are also in a state of stagnation due to the interruption of traffic and the inability to import many raw materials. Therefore, although the Chinese Communists chanted "Protect National Industry and Commerce," the current decline of industry and commerce casts a terrible shadow in the minds of general industrialists and businessmen. At the same time, due to changes in social lifestyles, the Chinese Communists' future industrial and commercial policies will be re-examined and formulated.

Regarding the price of goods in Peiping, it once fell sharply when partial peace was first announced, but it immediately rebounded and returned to its original state in less than a day. During the vacuum period when the old was gone and the new had not yet entered the city, prices showed even more dramatic increases. The increase in silver dollars was more than ten times higher than when it fell. When the Communist army entered the city, although it was just the beginning of the Lunar New Year and the market had not yet opened. However, when it came to the seventh day of the first month, which was supposed to be the opening day, the general stores took the excuse of not yet announcing the exchange rate between the people's currency and the gold yuan and remained closed and did not operate. The gold and US dollar markets have not yet opened. Later, the exchange rate between the gold yuan and the people's currency was determined to be ten to one, and prices were once again impacted and rose sharply. When I left Peiping (around February 20), the price of silver dollars rose again from 240 people's currency per dollar to 300 people's currency per dollar (that is, 3,000 gold yuan). Except for miscellaneous grains, coal and other local products, which increased less, other items such as gasoline, newspapers, cigarettes, hardware, Western medicine, gold notes, and silver dollars all increased very sharply! The price of goods in Peiping after peace was also unstable.

The time for the use of the gold yuan was announced as two months, exchanged for the people's currency at a rate of ten to one. Workers, students, and urban poor were given preferential treatment, and could exchange for the people's currency at a rate of three to one with a residence permit or official letter, limited to fifteen days. The poor quality of the paper used to print the people's currency was somewhat like the ghost money we burned to the dead. If you put it in your pocket for a day or two, it would become blurry or torn. The banknotes of the Jinan Bank and the Beihai Bank were even worse. Now that the Peiping branch of the Central Printing Factory has been taken over, it may be possible to print a batch of better banknotes. In this action of exchanging gold yuan, although the Chinese Communists were able to absorb the gold yuan early and purchase goods from the Kuomintang area to maintain the value of the gold yuan, it also fully demonstrated the Chinese Communist cadres' efficiency and service spirit! The exchange began on February 6th. Several hundred exchange points were set up in the east, west, north, and south main streets of the city. Although the people exchanging were so crowded, the exchange was completed ahead of schedule on February 15th. This is very different from the efficiency and service spirit of the past issuance of the gold yuan, which was exchanged by various banks. The country's misgovernment by bureaucratic style is once again proven here.

Peiping is a cultural city. There are no less than hundreds of universities and schools of all sizes. The number of students should be in the hundreds of thousands. The situation of the education sector and schools in Peiping after peace is certainly a matter of concern to everyone. As far as I know, the first university to be taken over was Tsinghua University. The School Affairs Committee organized by representatives of professors was responsible for maintaining it. No president was appointed. As for how to reform the courses in various departments, it is still under research and discussion. The start of classes is indefinite. The situation in other national universities is also roughly the same. Most have organized school affairs committees to be responsible for receiving and maintaining them. Some private universities have also cancelled the president system and followed suit. It is the same across the board that the Three People's Principles have stopped being taught, the Kuomintang and Sanqing Tuan students have stopped their activities, and the establishment of the Dean of Students has been abolished. Some students from various schools participated in the Military Control Commission's takeover work. Most of them returned to their hometowns because of the isolation of postal and telecommunications and the interruption of economic sources. In the past, public-funded students were still complaining every day even with government subsidies and white flour. Now the Chinese Communists only issue a small amount of corn flour or millet per person to maintain life, and they no longer dare to complain!

The teachers and staff of primary schools have held several meetings, collective learning and discussions, and members of the Chinese Communist Party have been sent to participate in guidance and explanation. The main issues are textbooks, tuition fees, and course schedules. Fortunately, the Chinese Communists already had a set of primary school textbooks in the liberated areas in the past, which could be used as long as they were reprinted. Other issues such as tuition fees and course schedules can be easily decided immediately to seek liberation. The problems in middle schools are more complicated. The minds of teachers also need to be changed. With collective learning, the start of classes is still far away, or classes may be started as usual first, and then gradually improved later. In short, when I left Peiping (February 20), it was a fact that none of the schools, large, medium, or small, had started classes.

After the Zhengzhong Book Company and the Independent Publishing House were taken over by the Chinese Communists, they were renamed Xinhua Bookstore. Its store front was located at the southern end of Wangfujing Street. A reading room was also set up next to it for people to enter and browse at will. On the opening day, there were many buyers! The Xinhua Bookstore is the Chinese Communist Party's spiritual granary. After Peiping was partially pacified, everyone needed to learn Mao Zedong Thought, so they had to seek it from this granary. The Xinhua Bookstore was often crowded with readers and buyers. Everyone hoped to find some new knowledge here. A hardcover collection of Mao Zedong's essays costs more than 700 people's currency, which is more than 7,000 gold yuan. The price is too expensive, making it impossible for many people with not-so-rich economies to buy it, so they have to look away. This business that speculates in making money and also assumes propaganda tasks is also very worthwhile.

Peiping was originally a consuming city. Because the cost of living was not too expensive, not a few young people who had dropped out of school and were unemployed stayed in Peiping! Especially after the Northeast and Northwest were successively abandoned, the area gradually shrunk to only Peiping. Many people who fled to Peiping from various places also came! This time, after the partial peace was realized, many institutions were abolished, so there were also many unemployed. The North China People's Revolutionary University, which trains general cadres, and the Military and Political University, which trains military cadres, of the Chinese Communists just happened to announce their recruitment in Peiping. They need to recruit more than 10,000 people, which is of course a major impulse for these wandering and depressed unemployed and out-of-school youth. Everyone flocked to the registration offices of Peking University and Normal University to register. Fortunately, as long as you have a higher elementary school education or above, you can apply to the university. Who doesn't want to try it? They are tested as they come, and the criteria for admission will not be too strict. What the Chinese Communists need today are cadres. After this replenishment, it should be a major gain!

### Storing Grain Among the People: Xinjiang Expands Spring Plowing Movement

— Wei Wei

[Dihua, 11th (Airmail)] When mentioning the grain issue in Xinjiang, one cannot help but think of Yili, known as the "Jiangnan Beyond the Great Wall." Yili has long been known as the granary of northern Xinjiang and the land of rice and wheat. It possesses natural advantages with abundant rainfall, fertile soil, and a warm climate, making its grain production the highest in the province. The annual output, considering only rice and wheat, reaches four to five million shi (a unit of dry measure). If corn, sorghum, highland barley, and other coarse grains are included, the figure exceeds six to seven million shi.

Unable to Eat Yili Rice

In the past, military, public, and civilian grain for northern Xinjiang relied entirely on Yili. Even the trains running to Siberia loaded some rice and white flour exported from Yili.

However, this fertile land unfortunately experienced the Yili Incident in the autumn of 1945. Since then, Yili has been separated from the control and management of the Xinjiang government, and it has no longer been possible to eat rice and white flour from Yili.

Following the Yili Incident, the Ashan and Tacheng regions also became special, greatly affecting the grain supply in northern Xinjiang. Northern Xinjiang is divided into five regions; after the Yili Incident, only the Dihua and Hami regions remained. Now, the entire grain supply of northern Xinjiang relies solely on these two regions. However, the grain production of these two regions is less than one-third of the total. The four counties under the jurisdiction of the Hami region—Hami, Zhenxi, Yiwu, and Qijiaojing—are very barren, with an annual grain output of no more than 150,000 shi. The eleven counties under the jurisdiction of the Dihua region—Dihua, Fukang, Bansu, Qitai, Muli River, Changji, Jinghua, Suilai, Turpan, Shanshan, and Toksun—produce no more than 1.5 million shi even in a good harvest (including other coarse grains). This amount is insufficient to supply the needs of northern Xinjiang, where the province's population is concentrated.

Whenever there is a grain shortage panic, people cannot forget this fertile land—Yili.

Production is Severely Unbalanced

Besides the Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan regions, the province currently has seven other regions: five in southern Xinjiang and two in northern Xinjiang. The total arable land is approximately 14,580,000 mu (a unit of area), which can produce 7 million shi of wheat, over 700,000 shi of rice, over 400,000 shi of highland barley, over 700,000 shi of corn, over 400,000 shi of lentils, over 400,000 shi of red beans, over 400,000 shi of mung beans, over 700,000 shi of sorghum, and over 500,000 shi of millet. However, this figure is an estimate for a year of good harvest; last year's harvest was only half of this amount.

Before the Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan regions became special, the grain production of southern and northern Xinjiang was balanced. Currently, however, southern Xinjiang accounts for over 70% of the production, while northern Xinjiang accounts for only 30%.

This imbalance in grain supply and demand has caused the Xinjiang authorities considerable headaches. Each year, the provincial treasury allocates large sums of money to transport grain from southern Xinjiang to meet the needs of northern Xinjiang, and provides subsidies to encourage sugar merchants to transport grain from southern Xinjiang to sell in northern Xinjiang. However, this approach is like trying to quench a thirst with water from afar.

Transportation Costs Exceed Grain Prices

Xinjiang is a vast region, and the distance between southern and northern Xinjiang is not short, often reaching hundreds or even thousands of kilometers. Moreover, transportation is inconvenient, and transportation tools are scarce. Motor vehicle transportation can only reach Yanqi, Luntai, Kashi, and Aksu, while transportation to other counties relies entirely on animal-powered postal transport. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, freight costs are high, which not only slows down the transportation rate but also increases the provincial government's expenses significantly. Transporting one shi of grain from southern Xinjiang to northern Xinjiang costs dozens of times more than the price of the grain itself. However, in order to supplement the grain shortage in northern Xinjiang, the provincial government has no choice but to grit its teeth and do so.

Agriculture is Difficult to Develop

Regarding the state of agriculture in Xinjiang, it is a continental region with a cold and dry climate and little rainfall. The soil is mostly alkaline and sandy, so its harvest yields are not as good as those in the interior. Even in a good harvest year, the average yield is only 50% (i.e., harvesting five dou (a unit of dry measure) for every dou sown). Normally, a yield of 20-30% is considered good. As for farming techniques, they are also rudimentary. These natural geographical limitations and poor techniques hinder the development of agriculture in Xinjiang.

Is There Enough Food?

So, is there enough food in Xinjiang? The best way to answer this question is to examine the living standards of rural farmers. In the countryside, middle-class families are fortunate if they can eat bread. Most people fill their stomachs with millet, corn, and sorghum. Not to say that ten households out of ten are empty, but very few can afford to eat grain until April or May. Taking the recent procurement of public grain as an example, the depletion of grain is even more obvious. Even those allocated one or two shi have no grain to turn in. According to reports from various county governments, the people's annual harvest, after paying land taxes and procuring grain, leaves them with nothing to eat for themselves.

Looking at the current situation in Dihua, on the surface, it can barely be maintained. The government uses large amounts of cash to purchase grain from farmers, who, in order to obey the government, sell all they have. In fact, some farmers even have problems with seeds. Now that spring plowing is imminent, various counties are requesting loans from the provincial government to provide seeds to farmers. If the heavens were to make things difficult for the people of Xinjiang and bring a drought, windstorm, or locust plague, then the more than four million people would inevitably face starvation.

Ways to Develop Grain Sources

If there is not enough food in Xinjiang, what should be done? We believe that: (1) the grain from Yili should be allowed to flow out quickly; (2) large-scale reclamation should be carried out on both banks of the Tarim River, where there are endless fertile green lands that have not been cultivated. If the government could allocate large sums of money to open up and relocate immigrants to cultivate the land, we believe that the harvest would be significant; (3) water conservancy should be developed, as most crops in Xinjiang fail due to lack of water; (4) transportation should be developed to ensure balanced supply; (5) agricultural loans should be expanded to increase production; and (6) farming techniques should be improved, and pest and disease control should be implemented.

The Xinjiang Provincial Government is now making its best efforts in these areas. As far as we know, many tons of white flour from Yili are about to be transported to Dihua. The provincial bank has already allocated a large amount of spring plowing loans. Recently, Chairman Bao Erhan personally ordered the Construction Department and other relevant agencies to promote the expansion of spring plowing. The Uyghur-language Xinjiang Daily is responding to this need by preparing to publish several special supplements. Liu Mengchun, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government, once emphatically pointed out the firm stance and methods of "storing grain among the people" at a meeting of the Financial and Economic Group. We can believe that the Xinjiang Provincial Government is moving towards self-reliance, and that food can be made self-sufficient.

### Relaxed Control of Vessels in the First District; Stations Established in Fushan and Huangtian Ports

[Our Correspondent in Wujin, 14th] The Commander of the First Pacification District has stipulated measures to control all transportation vehicles on the north and south banks of the Yangtze River within its jurisdiction, as well as all vessels, rafts, and bamboo rafts on the inland rivers of southern Jiangsu.

(3) Essential vessels for maintaining transportation will be approved and escorted by military personnel to travel to designated ports. (4) Except for military vessels, all others will be moved into inland rivers and Taihu Lake, where they can operate freely. (5) Management stations will be established first at the four main ports: Fushan, Huangtian Port, Yinshakou, and Zhenjiang. (6) For long-distance voyages along the Yangtze River, licenses must be presented for inspection at entry and exit points, and foreign vessels will be handled in accordance with international law.

### Miniature News

Nanjing [Our Correspondent] Qian Jilin, accountant of the National Frontier Cultural and Educational Museum, went to Taiwan on official business. Previous reports that he had absconded with public funds and property are inaccurate.

Yixing [Our Correspondent] Yesterday morning at around 6:00 AM, a company of regular troops from the Tangdu area of Dingshu District in the county marched to Shushan Town, surrounded the town hall, cut off traffic, confiscated all the regular constabulary, including one machine gun and twenty rifles, and took away five squad leaders and two local residents in the direction of Changxing. Their whereabouts are unknown. The county government has reported the incident and telegraphed the Changxing County government for assistance in apprehending them.

Changshu [Our Correspondent] Following incidents of attacks and gun confiscations against local self-defense forces and security regiments in rural areas, the Provincial Security Commander has telegraphed the county government, pointing out the lack of strict precautions when the regular constabulary is attacked by thugs. He urged the authorities to order their subordinates to strengthen self-defense organizations, tighten security, and search for scattered bandits to maintain public order.

Jiangyin [Our Correspondent] The Cheng County Grain Office has over-allocated more than 10,000 shi of military grain based on the collected land tax figures. Although Deputy Director Xu went to the province to request a suspension of the allocation, it was not approved due to the urgency of military supplies. After repeated pleas, a grain purchasing plan was formulated. Xu returned to Cheng on the 12th and convened a meeting of heads of various agencies to decide that the province would order the purchase of 3,000 large bags of unmilled military grain (totaling 4,000 shi). The province would allocate funds to purchase grain with cash through the Grain Industry Association from Wuxi and Jiangyin counties, with the Grain Supervision Committee issuing certificates. The price would be based on the market price on the day of purchase. The provincial office has allocated 10 million yuan and will purchase at the current market price.

### National Bank Allots Original Gold to Silver Shops: Yesterday Adopts Quoted Pricing and Allocation System; No Applications in the Morning, Applications Submitted but Not Allocated in the Afternoon

[Our Correspondent] The Central Bank's method of allocating original gold to silver shops has been changed to a quoted pricing and allocation system, as decided by the Financial Stabilization Committee. It is stipulated that from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM, each silver shop will submit the quantity of gold it wishes to be allocated to the National Bank. After 11:00 AM, a three-person team will determine the allocation price, notify each applicant, and then the applicant will remit payment to collect the allocated gold.

After the National Bank notified the silver shops of the change to a quoted pricing and allocation system at 10:00 AM yesterday, applications were accepted until nearly 11:00 AM. However, due to the new method only just being implemented, many silver shops adopted a wait-and-see approach, and consequently, no one applied. In the afternoon, the silver shops submitted quoted prices for allocation from 2:00 PM until the 3:30 PM deadline. The quoted prices were 375,000 yuan, which the National Bank deemed that there was no need to allocate, and as a result, no gold was allocated.

After the method of allocating gold was changed, Lin Chongyong, Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, stated that the method of allocating gold had long been determined to be of two types. The one implemented in the past was the first type, and the one implemented yesterday was the second type. In order to take the initiative, the Central Bank decided to implement these two methods alternately, so that the silver shops would be unable to predict the Stabilization Committee's allocation price, and there was no other intention, he said.

President of the Central Bank, Liu Gongyun, convened two meetings at the Bank of China starting at 9:00 AM yesterday. The first was the regular meeting of the Gold and Silver Stabilization Committee, attended by Xi Demao, Li Daonan, Lin Chongyong, Shao Huihua, Chen Changtong, and others, to discuss improving the technical aspects of gold allocation. The second was a review meeting, which was also attended by Bi Delin, a special representative of the Ministry of Finance, and a representative of the Supervisory Envoy's Office. Liu reported on past allocation situations, followed by a review meeting. After the meeting, which ended at 11:15 AM, all attendees remained silent. It is said that many concrete decisions were made.

### Rumors Abound Outside the Market; Chinese Stocks Weaken Midday

[Our Correspondent] The Chinese stock market opened high and closed low yesterday, rising steadily in the middle, but then turned around near noon. The money market was loose due to the influence of the overnight clearing by banks, and the day rate was below 70 yuan with ample supply. The sentiment was good in the morning due to the loose money supply. Various factions were still buying actively, and the market was holding steady. Later, rumors spread within the circle, and sentiment on the trading floor became uneasy. The bulls were particularly vulnerable, and the market weakened for a time. Yong Yarn opened high at 6.6 yuan under the influence of buying from all sides. Covering overnight short positions pushed it up to 6.71 yuan. Buying from the financial and securities factions pushed it up further to 6.75 yuan. Large investors sold at high prices, and the market softened slightly, falling to 6.61 yuan and 6.58 yuan, stabilizing at around 6.6 yuan in the middle. Later, rumors spread outside the market, and gold weakened for a time. Sentiment was panicked, and buying was dismal, falling to 6.49 yuan. Finally, the rumors subsided, and the gold market recovered, stabilizing sentiment, and rising again to 6.58 yuan. Near the close, it was reported that the physical market was unanimously weak, and sellers were selling in droves. The market fell again, closing at 6.41 yuan. Small and medium-sized stocks all opened higher in the morning, and Jingfu and Xinguang saw brisk buying from retail investors, rising to the limit for a time. Meiya and Qinxing also trended upward after opening, recovering to their opening levels at noon. Taiwan Sugar fell after opening high, stabilizing near the close. Tongyi also hit the limit, while the rest were mediocre. Turnover was 4.0969 billion shares.

Resumption of After-Hours Trading Next Week

At that time, deferred delivery trading will also be opened simultaneously. The exchange is ready and can be implemented as soon as the Ministry of Finance issues the order, he said.

Foreign Stocks Rise Slightly, Gold Bonds Perform Well

Sentiment was stable at the opening, and buying was still strong on the trading floor. Later, it was reported that the Hong Kong exchange rate had narrowed again, and the market became slightly better.

### Gold Prices Rise

[Our Correspondent] Gold prices rose in both the morning and afternoon sessions yesterday. Initially, due to the loose money supply and low shadow rates, many retail investors were unwilling to lend, so the psychology of holding goods became strong again, and the bulls were active on the trading floor, with the market rising steadily. The opening in the morning was quite good under the influence of buying, opening initially at 382, 387. New buying increased after the opening, covering short positions, and the market first traded at 385, 387, then at 390, 393, rising to as high as 396. After the high, sentiment turned weak, and the bulls became cautious, with many taking profits, falling back to 385, 382 for a time. At noon, the Central Bank had not taken any action, and sentiment was stable, closing at 385, 388.

In the afternoon, the money supply loosened further, and buying was still strong on the trading floor, with the market rising in a straight line. The opening was initially at 405, 410, and it traded firmly after the opening, rising gradually, reaching 415, 418 after 3:00 PM, and finally closing at 417, 420.

The US dollar opened at 7650 yuan, 7750 yuan in the morning, rising to 7850 yuan, 7900 yuan in the middle of the session, before falling back to 7650 yuan, 7700 yuan, closing at 7700 yuan, 7750 yuan at noon.

### A Stroll Through the Market: The Onlooker's Perspective

A big rise is not considered a rise, one has a radiant face, even if no gold can be allocated, one can still not show one's hand.

Yesterday, general prices rose by another 20% or so across the board. Calculating interest rates, it is also not considered a rise, so it is not good to say that the Central Bank has lost control of the market. The Central Bank's high-interest policy is meant to offset the extent of this rampant rise. The face looks much better, and the magic of the high-interest policy is to blame the responsibility for the rampant rise on the high interest.

Shifting responsibility is a traditional practice in Chinese officialdom, previously only seen in general administration, and its application to economics is a recent phenomenon.

In recent years, hyperinflation has led to soaring prices. In the past, the authorities often said, "It is the result of speculation and hoarding," lightly shifting the responsibility to merchants and civilians.

In the past, this method of shifting responsibility was not clever because one was at a loss when the market soared, which was a bit embarrassing.

Now, with high interest, the responsibility for the rampant rise can be shifted to interest rates. Moreover, a 20% increase in one day was considered a rampant rise in the past; now it is considered not to have risen. In the past, a doubling in three or five days was rare and considered extremely serious. Now, because the daily rate of 5 jiao or more is the base, even if it doubles in a day, it is only considered to be 80%. The advantage of high interest lies in treating a big rise as a small rise.

The high-interest policy can be said to be an incredibly clever way to shift responsibility. However, the financial authorities, being good at using their brains, came up with another new trick yesterday, changing the method of allocating gold to quoted pricing and allocation.

Quoted pricing and allocation is also a good way to shift responsibility. Let me tell you its magic:

(1) In the past, the Central Bank bore the responsibility of raising gold prices when it increased the allocated gold price. Now, the applicant submits the price they are willing to pay, and after the Central Bank approves it, the allocation is made. Therefore, the applicant raises the price they are willing to pay, and the Central Bank can allocate it at the high price, thereby shifting the responsibility for the price increase to the merchants.

(2) If the applicant lowers the price they are willing to pay, then the Central Bank has the right not to allocate. Therefore, this method is not disadvantageous.

(3) In the past, when the Central Bank posted prices for allocation, it had the responsibility to fully allocate according to the posted prices. What a dangerous responsibility! Now, by changing to quoted pricing and allocation, the Central Bank can avoid showing its hand that it has no gold to allocate under the guise of not approving the quoted price, even when there is no gold to allocate.

From this, it can be known that the magic of this "quoted pricing and allocation" is: (1) it has the reality of allocating gold at a high price, but without the responsibility of allocating at a high price; (2) it can avoid showing its hand when there is no gold to allocate.

### Silver Dollar Deposits: Ministry of Finance Agrees to Consider

Regarding the issue of silver dollar deposits, a responsible person from the Ministry of Finance recently stated that the Ministry of Finance is considering it, and there are no problems in principle. However, the Ministry of Finance does not intend to have any rigid regulations. If various banks and firms have some plans, they can be approved, but the level of interest and the use of deposits cannot exceed the scope of laws and regulations, and those that conflict with the Banking Law will be subject to suppression.

Yesterday, the money supply loosened slightly, and all commodities rose. Moreover, after the index was released, general salary earners, in order to avoid the devaluation of cash, were all vying to exchange for silver dollars, and the value of big-head silver dollars increased a hundredfold. In the morning, the quoted price for big-head silver dollars was only 53 (bid), 55 (offer), but by the evening, someone was still exchanging them at 6,200. It is said that the speed of this rise has set a record for the rise in silver dollars.

### Gold and Silver Market: Uncertainty Surrounds Next Week's Establishment

[Reported by this newspaper] According to a responsible person from a certain bureau of the National Bank yesterday, the relevant authorities hope to formally establish the gold and silver market in the city next Monday to commence trading. The market will trade in gold, silver, and silver dollars. Currently, they are awaiting the financial authorities' approval of the gold spot trading methods drafted by the Gold Industry Association to ensure compliance during trading.

Furthermore, the city's Gold Industry Association began clearing accumulated items from the association's premises yesterday. Negotiations for installing telephone lines are ongoing. The number of members who have registered to resume business has reached twenty, while the number of those requesting application forms has reached one hundred. Based on the association's current preparations, the prospect of resuming business next Monday remains uncertain.

### Bank Outflows Cause Easy Money

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the money market went from easy to excessive. The opening day's interbank lending rate was still in the range of eighty to ninety yuan. Later, with stable gold and banknote prices and increased lending, frequent remittances from other cities and national treasury disbursements resulted in significant outflows of funds. By the afternoon, the market was flooded with cash, and the interbank lending rate fell sharply from seventy-five yuan to sixty-five yuan, eventually settling around sixty yuan.

Yesterday, the national banks and bureaus had a substantial net outflow of 3.66 billion yuan, foreign banks had a net outflow of 8.3 billion yuan, while the major clearinghouses had a net inflow of 610 million yuan, and the minor clearinghouses had a net inflow of 2.73 billion yuan.

### Strong Sales, Easy Money; Rice Prices Rise Again and Again

White rice closes at a high of 42,000 yuan; Edible Oil Market Initially Firm, Eventually Retreats; Flour Demand Strong

Rice prices continue to rise. With easy money at the start of trading, all types of rice in the South Market increased by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The Central Market briefly saw a slight dip, but due to strong sales and easy money, prices rose again at the close. White rice closed at 42,000 yuan, up 4,500 yuan, while both thin and early rice rose by 3,500 yuan. In the North Market, ordinary glutinous and thin rice rose by 3,000 yuan, and special glutinous rice reached 43,500 yuan. Total arrivals in both markets amounted to 6,111 piculs.

Edible Oil

Prices rose sharply at the opening but fell back at the close, both influenced by the ease and tightness of the money market. Rapeseed oil saw a significant increase, opening at 165,000 yuan and closing at 154,000 yuan, a rise of 8,000 yuan. Soybean oil closed at 160,000 yuan, up 9,000 yuan. A good barrel of raw oil was at 200,000, opening at 198,000 yuan, up 14,000 yuan. Soybean cake rose by 1,000 yuan, with a weak close.

Flour

Prices generally rose by 10%. At the start, with easy money, demand from buyers was strong, and with gold prices soaring, market sentiment was very firm. Old brand flour once traded as high as 17,655 yuan, and military ship flour even broke the 17,000 yuan mark. Later, rumors of central bank intervention caused the money market to tighten, and sellers became cautious. Hearing that outside the circle the market was weakening, holders, wary of holding high positions, rushed to sell, and the market eventually declined. Military ship flour traded at 16,830 yuan, and old brand flour was offered at 17,600 yuan, but there were few takers.

Miscellaneous Grains

At the start, with rice prices soaring, market sentiment was uniformly bullish. Yellow beans rose sharply by 10%, and car beans traded as high as 33,000 yuan. Winter beans were in demand from out-of-town buyers, rising by an average of 15%. Later, with oil cake weakening and implicit interest rates rising, many holders sold off, and prices fell back by 500 yuan. Raw peanuts rose again, and sesame prices rose rapidly by over 10%. Corn prices fell due to quiet activity from the Green Gang.

Tung Oil Rises

Tung oil prices rose immediately after the market opened yesterday, spurred by the uniform increase in public utility and shipping costs, which greatly stimulated the market. Soon after, with easy money within the industry and the sudden rise in goods outside the industry, market sentiment became even more excited, demand overflowed, and sellers took the opportunity to bid up prices, causing a surge in prices. By the close, each grade had risen by a significant 15,000 yuan, and the foothold was also quite solid.

Tea Market Rises Again

Since tea stocks have been steadily declining, sellers regard the small amount of old stock they hold as rare commodities, refusing to sell easily. However, export box tea is difficult to sell due to prices being higher than overseas tea prices, resulting in a prolonged period of quiet trading, while prices have repeatedly risen.

Domestic tea from this street and other places showed some interest, but trading was limited, and underlying momentum was unwilling to settle for less than soaring prices.

It is also reported that the "pre-Qingming new tea" of Longjing green tea, which is specifically for domestic sale, is developing very well this year due to the favorable weather. It is said that tea from the Wenzhou production area will arrive in Shanghai in about two weeks. However, according to middlemen, tea prices are mostly calculated based on rice prices. Given the current situation, it is expected that the opening price of new tea this year will be a surprise.

Hangzhou Wood Rises Sharply

Wood prices rose sharply due to the easing of monetary conditions and the renewed bullish sentiment after the release of the cost of living index. Except for plywood, which remained the same as the previous day, other types of wood such as foreign pine, wood pine chips, fir, Tanhu wood, and red willow boards all rose by about 10%. However, Hangzhou wood saw the most significant increase, jumping from 130,000 to 180,000 yuan per tael, with select goods reaching as high as 200,000 yuan. It is said that this is due to the military purchasing 200,000 pieces, resulting in a severe shortage of market stock.

### Cigarettes and Soap Rise Sharply

Cigarettes and soap both saw a sharp increase, due to the soaring cost of living, the easing of monetary conditions, and the day's lending rate falling to as low as seven cents. The opening prices all rose by over 10% amidst frequent favorable news. White tin-packaged cigarettes reached a new high of 8,000 yuan, a sharp increase of over 500 yuan. Twenty-piece British cigarettes went beyond 3,000 yuan to 3,360 yuan, also a sharp increase of 340 yuan.

The rise in soap prices was even more severe. Guben soap hit 66,000 yuan, a surge of 4,000 yuan. Beautiful Matches closed at a new high of 320,000 yuan, also a surge of 70,000 yuan. Miscellaneous brands closed at 150,000 yuan, all rising by 10,000 yuan.

### Cotton Yarn Prices Hold Firm; Cloth Market Slightly Firmer at the Close

Cotton yarn prices held firm, as the monetary situation eased and market sentiment turned bullish. Holders, due to cost considerations, were reluctant to sell, and there was little activity from out-of-town buyers, with speculators dominating the market. Initial firmness in prices eventually gave way, with a slight upward trend at the close.

42-count Blue Phoenix nearly reached 3 million yuan, but gradually declined, closing as low as 2.85 million yuan, still up 190,000 yuan from the previous day. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 120,000 yuan, and 32-count Silver Moon rose by 140,000 yuan, ending at 1.83 million yuan.

21-count Double Horse spot goods declined from 1.495 million yuan to 1.445 million yuan at the close, still up 45,000 yuan, with factory orders last done at 1.44 million yuan. 20-count Double Horse was at 1.37 million yuan, a rise of 100,500 yuan.

Other brands like Jincheng and Tiannv were still active, rising by about 120,000 yuan each, with 16-count yarn generally rising by 100,000 yuan, and 10-count Boy Scout hitting the 1 million yuan mark.

The cloth market, buoyed by the gains in the outside market yesterday afternoon, opened higher. However, short sellers remained active, and direct sales did not improve. Individual holders lacked support and rushed to close positions, causing various cloths to fall into a soft market. At the close, many short positions were covered, and the market slightly recovered.

Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 60,000 yuan, once reaching a high of 60,500 yuan before declining to a low of 58,500 yuan, closing at 59,000 yuan, up 8,000 yuan from the previous day. Trumpet Boy fine cloth rose by 5,000 yuan, ending at 54,000 yuan.

Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge opened at 58,000 yuan, then fell to 55,900 yuan before settling at 56,400 yuan, a rise of 7,400 yuan. Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance Yuan Serge last traded at 54,300 yuan, also up 6,800 yuan. High-grade 190 Prussian blue rose to 122,000 yuan. In addition, poplin and flower serge both reached new peaks. In the afternoon, prices in the outside market were slightly higher, with Dragon Head fine cloth at 62,000 yuan and Four Gentlemen Yuan Serge at 59,500 yuan.

### China Textile Sells Yarn

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company sold yarn to replication industries as usual, offering a total of thirteen types, selling 57 pieces, and approving 31 buyers, with a total value of 12.35 million yuan.

### Silk and Satin Rise Even More Sharply

Yesterday morning, raw silk of superior grade was offered at a high of 2.9 million yuan, closing at 2.85 million yuan in the afternoon. More than ten loads of "Bank" and "Dapeng" were traded. Compared to the previous afternoon's close, this was an increase of 150,000 yuan. Buying interest remained weak, and export trading houses were as stagnant as before, with no other transactions. Rayon: Tianqiao initial spot price was 1.9 million yuan, Snia Viscose was 1.88 million yuan. Immediate transactions were offered at 2.02 million yuan, and bids were at 2.015 million yuan, but buying interest was also weak, up more than 200,000 yuan from the previous afternoon's close.

Silk and Satin: Huaqiang bedspreads opened at 1.38 million yuan, briefly rising to a peak of 1.405 million yuan, then falling to a low of 1.375 million yuan, closing at 1.376 million yuan in the afternoon, up more than 100,000 yuan from the previous afternoon's close. Other items also generally rose by 15%.

### Rayon Price List

[Reported by this newspaper] The China Trust Bureau's rayon conference's eleventh (from the 14th to the 19th of this month) rayon price list includes Italian goods, 120 count, grade 3, glossy, at 1,663,000 gold yuan per case.

### Mercerized Feather Yarn Sells Well

Mercerized feather yarn has been selling well recently. Various merchants with unobstructed transportation continue to have demand, and Western clothing tailors, woolen cloth and satin foreign goods stores in this street also have healthy buying interest, due to the surge in Western suit business, which increases the use of linings. Gray and light colors are especially popular. On the selling price front, due to the high cost of silk yarn raw materials and dyes, and the rising cost of living, all prices are rising. Yesterday, dyed special grade feather yarn was quoted at 2,450 yuan per yard wholesale, first grade at 1,900 yuan, second grade at 1,600 yuan, and third grade at 1,300 yuan.

### Four Mines Joint Management Office Adjusts Coal Allocation Prices

White coal fines are 90,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan. Transportation fees have also risen to 16,000 yuan per ton.

### Small Factory Loan Program to End on the 19th

The Small Factory Loan program, organized by the Central Bank's Lending Committee, has been decided to end on the 19th of this month. The reason is that the Lunar New Year holiday has passed, and the number of applicants has dwindled. Furthermore, the Central Bank's Lending Committee believes that the emergency relief is over and intends to end the program soon. According to inquiries made by reporters, if special circumstances arise, whether exceptions can be made. It was reported that if such circumstances are encountered and the facts are verified, loans can be granted under the emergency industrial loan method, referring to the small industrial loan regulations. However, this must be done through a bank. The agent bank can be freely recommended by the applicant manufacturer.

### British Troops Lack Strategy, Missing the Final Shot; Qingbai Cleverly Scores Twice

[Reported by this newspaper] The British Navy football team, despite their bravery, lacked strategy. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, they played their third match at the Yiyuan Stadium and lost 2-0 to the city champions, Qingbai. Although the British controlled the game and launched a fierce attack for eighty minutes, they failed to score a single goal, returning with a duck egg. Qingbai, on the other hand, produced unexpected players, scoring one goal in each half, winning the game 2-0. The Yiyuan Stadium was quite lively, with the largest crowd of spectators for the British Navy's three matches, estimated at over 2,000 people.

The British Navy's lineup yesterday was again a new face, changing for the third consecutive game, but still failing to achieve a victory. In addition to the soldiers from the flagship HMS London, several players from the HMS Cossack were added, making it a mixed formation. The team's style consistently adhered to the British Navy's policy of bold, sweeping, long-ball play, prioritizing attack over defense, with no hesitation. Unfortunately, the forwards did not bring their shooting boots. The Qingbai goal was heavily guarded, and the sound of thuds was constant, but they could not break through once. Their inaccuracy in shooting was such that the British Navy's defeat was due to this. Apart from the strong British central defense line, two new soldiers from the HMS Cossack were brought in on the wings yesterday, two short men who ran very fast. Several corner kicks were well executed, but there were often no receivers. Qingbai was heavily guarded, achieving nothing. The defenders only focused on advancing to assist in the attack, bravely and directly. When Qingbai launched a counterattack, they were helpless. Both goals conceded were due to the same mistake.

Qingbai defended more than they attacked, resulting in a victory. In the first half, they were almost entirely under the British attack. Facing cannonball shots, Huang Shijie caught and dived repeatedly, sending out several extremely dangerous balls, keeping Qingbai's defense intact. Huang Shijie deserves the most credit. Due to the British Navy's fierce attack, Meng Yiliang had to retreat to the third defender position to protect the territory. The central and rear defenders sometimes lined up in front of the goal to deal with the British, showing the fierceness of their attack. The forwards and defenders were therefore disconnected, but Xiao Luo was still the most active. Jin Lusheng scored the first goal in the first half, and Luo Shoufu scored the second goal in the second half. With their clever short passes, they finally overwhelmed the enemy.

Referee Zhang Le, linesmen He Chunhui and Ge Laixu. At 4:00 PM sharp, the British Navy kicked off and attacked. After being blocked by Qingbai, the ball went back and forth, returning to Qingbai's territory. The British immediately attacked with all their strength. Center Sims dribbled straight, but Meng Yiliang tackled him and fell to the ground. Sims took a shot at the goal from twenty yards out, but the ball flew over the crossbar. Bo Peiqi came back strongly, also firing a long-range shot, but it failed to hit the target, already giving Qingbai a scare. Qian Changrong used his left foot to hook the ball twice in front of the goal, but the ball went towards his own goal, fortunately saved by Huang Shijie. While the British were attacking vigorously, Xiao Luo suddenly emerged, intercepting the ball, circling left and right, dribbling straight in, and passing it to Jin Lusheng. British Navy defender Taitley, seeing the danger, rushed from the left. Jin Lusheng shot fiercely at the goal, but it hit Taitley's foot and bounced out. Jin added another shot, and Taitman was unable to save it. Within five minutes, the British Navy's goal had fallen. The British Navy did not lose heart due to this goal and continued to attack fiercely. The attack did not weaken, and the wings were especially active. The five forwards surrounded Qingbai, and Huang Shijie was busy with a lot of business, unable to respond in time. Under the leadership of Meng Yiliang, Qingbai became five defenders. Xiao Luo occasionally broke through, but Liu Tiyin caught up and failed to score, which was a great pity. Once, British right winger Moore advanced straight along the sideline, deceived Qian Changrong, and ran straight to the goal, passing to the center. Pan Tuoxun took a hook shot, which was extremely dangerous, but Zhang Shijie jumped up and saved it. Missile shots from McCes and Bo Peiqi continued to come, all falling into the barren wilderness. The British Navy's feet were not working, and their efforts were in vain. After forty minutes in the first half, Qingbai led by one goal.

After a ten-minute break, the situation slightly changed. The British Navy's morale was not as strong as in the first half, and the battle became more relaxed. Qingbai's forwards stood out, becoming active in the British Navy's territory. Both sides went back and forth for five or six minutes. The British Navy advanced from the left, charging to the front of the goal. Jiang Luqian intercepted and killed, passing the ball forward. Xue Peiran received it and broke through, dribbling straight in, penetrating deep into the British Navy's territory. Luo Shoufu also came for a relay race, single-handedly, circling left once and right once, deceiving both defenders, and going straight to the front of the goal. Taitman waited to be tied up, and with a shot at the goal, the British Navy's goal fell again. Qingbai's victory was secured, seeming effortless. Although the British Navy was still attacking, it was clearly at the end of their rope. After thirty minutes, two points came down, and the last ten minutes ended in a calm manner.

### Basketball Group A: Two Games Tonight; Hualian Re-encounters Huili; Enkas vs. Mai Ling Fight Postponed

There were originally three games in the basketball league's Group A today, including two in Group A1: Mai Lings re-encountering Enkas, and Hualian facing Huili again. However, the first game between Mai En was postponed due to the American Naval and Marine Youth Association Boxing Championships, with both sides requesting a postponement. The Basketball Committee approved the postponement and cancelled the order for that game, postponing the opening game of Group A2, West Qing Lan vs. Kang Team, to 6:30 PM. Starting today, ticket prices have been adjusted to 500 yuan upstairs, 1,000 yuan downstairs, and 1,500 yuan for assigned seats in the arena. The list of orders and referees is recorded first as follows:

West Qing Lan - Kang Team (Group A2) 6:30 PM Referees: Wu Xiaodi, Li Zhenzhong

Hualian - Huili (Group A1) 7:30 PM Referees: Chen Baolin, Jiang Yinseng

In the first game of Group A2, Kang Team will face West Qing Lan. Led by veteran Lu Dazhen, Kang Team has skilled players such as Tong Tingxuan and Rong Chengen. Most of the players are young and strong, full of fighting spirit. However, in this group, their schedule has arranged for them to face strong opponents one after another. They have suffered two defeats against Hua Dong Mao Xun. Although they won against You Yi, their hope of winning the championship is slim. West Qing Lan has won and lost half of their two games. Although the team's skills are not particularly outstanding, their speed is fast, and they are agile, making them a match for Kang Team. When the two teams meet, there will definitely be a fierce battle.

Following that, in Group A1, Hualian will face Huili again. Hualian is the leader of the Shanghai league. Although they lost to Pei Fei Er in the current league, they have won all of their other eight games, so their leading position is secure. Tonight, they will face Huili again, who they have previously defeated. They know their strength and strategy in detail, so they should be able to win again. However, Huili is not to be underestimated. Tian Fuhai, Cao Zhiji, and Wang Yongfang are all brave and fierce generals. Since Hua Yunshan, Chen Zhengmiao, and others have joined the team, their lineup has become more complete. Having been humiliated in the first round, they are harboring resentment. When they meet on a narrow road, they will definitely do their best to achieve revenge. A bloody battle is inevitable. The team rosters for the four teams are attached below:

(West Qing Lan) Sha Linsi Ki Ke En Mai Jin Tuo Bao Gu Ge Tuo Li Si Po Lang Ning Hui Sai Ke

(Kang Team) Zhou Dianlang Lu Dazhen Le Siliang Rong Chengen Zhang Naihao Gu Nenggeng Tong Tingxuan Wang Jingwu Wang Changan Xu Shun Gong

(Hualian) Ren Xiangcheng Li Zhenzhong Wu Chengzhang Le Jiazhou Fu Jinsheng Bao Songtu Liu Fushan Li Hanting Zhang Liangxiong

### Sports World: Ren Yu Team's Scoring Key; Wu Xinyun Breaks Foot Bone

[Reported by this newspaper] Wu Xinyun, the "scoring key" of Ren Yu, known for his mid-range shooting, was ambushed and injured his left foot in the game against Enkas the previous evening. After a doctor's diagnosis, it was revealed that the bone in the back of his foot had been broken by a kick. He cannot engage in strenuous exercise during the treatment period. Wu has moved from the training camp back to his home to rest since last night. It is feared that Wu will not be able to play in this year's league again.

It is reported that since Ren Yu suffered a defeat at the hands of Enkas in the second game of the first week of this league, they have been training in a residential camp, vowing to avenge the defeat. They have made significant progress in every game since then. After defeating Hu Jing and Mai Lings, they defeated Enkas with four points, winning seven out of nine games, making them the only team capable of threatening Hualian's dominance. Now, with this blow, although the runner-up is still possible, it is feared that it will be difficult to shake Hualian's position in the league.

### Today, Daxia and Wanli Compete for the Democratic Cup Final

The Daxia and Wanli football teams will replay the Democratic Cup at the Nanshi Stadium at 4:00 PM this afternoon. The referee is Chen Fubao, and the linesmen are Fang Rongfu and Zang Wenbin. Daxia's football skills are not weak, and they have a higher chance of winning.

### Shanghai Bank Ping Pong Wins Against Dagong

The Shanghai Bank Ping Pong Team played a friendly match against the Dagong Team yesterday, with the Shanghai Bank winning 6-1. Chen Linsheng was specially invited to be the referee. Dagong's main player Xu Junyuan lost to Shanghai Bank's Mei Bixian.

### Taiwan Bank Football Team Defeats Norwegian Ship

[Taipei Airmail] The Norwegian merchant ship Acton's crew team and the Taiwan Bank football team held a football match at Taipei Park yesterday (the 13th) afternoon. The audience reached 3,000 people, and it was very lively. The Norwegian team wore red striped vests and were broad and fat, while the Taiwan Bank team wore old blue and yellow vests. The referee was He Weijing, the captain of the Taiwan Bank team was Bao Liangyu, and the team roster was as follows: Feng Chengzhi, Chen Xiaozun, Chen Zunchang, Wang Yijun, Liu Xudong, Lin Junxian, Wang Mengjian, Zhang Xiaofeng, Guo Kunlin, Zhao Qiuzhou, (above) Wang Chengdan (below). The game started at 2:00 PM. Although the Norwegian team's players were large and strong, their movements were clumsy. The Taiwan Bank football team, having been through many battles, had clever flanking attacks and ambushes. The Norwegian team showed its inferiority from the start. Taiwan Bank saw its weakness in the first two rounds. Wang Yijun, Wang Mengjian, and Lin Junxian each scored a goal one after another, with Taiwan Bank winning the first half 3-0. In the second half, Taiwan Bank's Zhao Qiuzhou left the field, and Wang Chengdan took his place. The Norwegian team's players did not substitute. In the second half, the Norwegian team's morale was weak, the formation was chaotic, and communication was poor. Lin Junxian and Wang Mengjian scored two more goals. Finally, Taiwan Bank's Zhang Xiaofeng also easily kicked a goal from the front, with Taiwan Bank ultimately winning 6-1 against Norway.

### New Rules Applied in British Basketball Games

[British News Agency, London, 16th] New rules have been applied to British basketball games since January 1st. One of the latest rules is to expand the "free throw" area. According to this new rule, the "free throw" area has been doubled, and no player may remain in the free throw area for more than three seconds. This change prevents tall players from staying under the basket to catch the ball and shoot.

### Hong Kong Tennis: Enthusiastic Start, Ye Guanhong Highly Favored in Singles, Xu Family Showing Strong Form in Doubles

[Hong Kong, 16th Dispatch] Tennis is gradually becoming a craze in Hong Kong. Many people in the sports circle are happily picking up tennis rackets to learn. This tennis championship, hosted by our club, is worthy of praise. It can truly be said to be organized from a "purely sports perspective."

After yesterday's matches, the preliminary elimination work for both singles and doubles has been completed. The final eight pairs of "seeded players" in both singles and doubles have emerged one after another.

The eight singles players have now reached the stage of competing for the semi-finals. According to established practice, our club only charges admission fees during the semi-finals of open tournaments.

Last year, our club erected temporary stands, hoping to collect more admission fees, but things didn't go as planned. Ye Guanhong was unable to participate in the final singles match due to a rain-induced schedule change (he had to rush to Shanghai to participate in the National Games), so revenue was far from ideal.

Present-day Hong Kong is truly a miracle. In any ball game, Chinese players hold the greatest advantage. Among the eight seeded singles players, only Siklan and Horton are foreigners. In the final eight doubles pairs, only Zhong Shi, Aiyashi, Siklan, and Stokes have foreigners; the rest are all Chinese players.

In this year's singles and doubles, Ye Guanhong is still the most favored champion in singles. In doubles, the two Xus seem to be in a strong position to win the title.

Precisely because of this reason, the outcome of the championship doesn't seem to have major variations. In other words, the entire competition process is just going to be ordinary and dull and not attract high interest of fans.

Javanese player Li Wencheng, when returning to his country to participate in the National Games last year, passed through Hong Kong with his younger brother Wenxuan. At that time, they performed at our club's court. General observation was that he had potential.

This year, Wencheng is participating in the singles competition on his own, and also partnering with Chen Decan in the doubles competition. Chen Decan is also a "promising" player. If he participated in the singles competition, he would also "make a name."

I feel that Decan's high-altitude shots and net interceptions are no worse than Wencheng's, and his resilience is even better than Wencheng's.

Speaking of "resilience," last year, Siklan emerged. This year, there is another Qu Jinman. It is a pity that Jinman lacks stamina. Otherwise, following in Tao Guanqiu's footsteps, creating another style of "play" with long baseline shots, he could also become a good player.

If long baseline shots are powerful and well-placed, they not only force opponents to be unable to go to the net but also have to use long shots to cope. If the opponent is not good at playing this "hand," then it is an opportunity.

### Women's Basketball Tactics

— Translated by Qi Gong

The zone defense and the moving zone defense are different. In addition to being responsible for the area they guard, each defender must watch the overall movement, coordinate closely with the other two guards, and change positions in response. They must watch the dynamics of the other three attackers and determine a coordinated response. This method is mobile. If there is a skillful performance and cooperative collaboration, it is like a fan-shaped swing, taking the initiative to move to disturb the ball-carrying attacker.

In terms of defensive tactics, the man-to-man defense is certainly important, but under certain circumstances, it can be changed from a man-to-man defense to a moving zone defense. The zone defense allows players to have a clear performance, the chance of fouls is less, and the results are greater. If the defending player has a sense of premonition and accurately sees the opponent's passing action, it is easy to intercept the opponent's forward pass from the middle. This method is enough to cope with various offensive methods of the opponent. If the opponent's forward is not good at mid-range shooting but is good at forcing close to the basket to score, the defensive area can specifically protect the strongpoint near the basket to defend, so that the opponent's forward cannot get a chance to rush into the free throw area in the keyhole to shoot. If the opponent's forward is good at long-range shooting, the guard should expand the defensive area.

The moving zone defense is better than the fixed zone defense. The latter is rarely effective when used. If three of the opponent's forwards gather in one area to launch an offensive, using one guard to defend against three forwards in a fixed manner is tantamount to an螳臂擋車 (idiom: an ant trying to fell a tree - overestimating one's capabilities). It is easy for the opponent to break through the defensive formation with a three-on-one attack. Therefore, the essence of the moving zone defense is analyzed in detail in the next section.

There are also several types of moving zone defense. Each type has its own different tactics, and each must be based on the method used by the opponent's forward when attacking to be conducive to the guard's defense. Now, let's talk about two defensive methods that are beneficial to the guards.

(A) To use this method, there must be a tall, agile player who can move flexibly to serve as the center guard.

Her position is in front of the free throw line, managing the center semicircle of the basket, 15 feet from the semicircle's radius. She must try to prevent the opponent's center from passing the ball or　entering the lane to shoot. When the opponent's center is approaching directly with the ball, the center guard must slow down the ball carrier's forward speed. She may pass the ball to her teammates. The center guard must keep the center outside the circumference while letting her two guards move their formation with the location of the ball to take a defensive posture.

In this situation, the other two guards are all concentrated on the left to defend due to the location of the ball, or all concentrated on the right to defend, or divided into left and right to take a defensive posture.

When the opponent's forward has a rushing-in shooting motion, each guard immediately changes to a man-to-man defense system, tightly guarding the forward closest to you, and the duty of the center guard is to try to guard the last forward who enters the formation with the ball, hindering her from easily getting the chance to shoot.

This moving zone system's tactic is to permeate the man-to-man defense system, which is more complicated to use, and not easy for novice teams to understand and use. Each player must be clear-headed, distinguishing when to use the moving zone defense system and when to adapt to the situation and change to a man-to-man defense system due to the enemy's changing formation.

Under this defensive system, each guard cannot be designated to guard a certain area in front. If a guard wants to be able to control the area they are guarding effectively, it depends on the guard's agility, skillful performance, and even more so on keen judgment.

### Reflections from a Sphere-Loving Circle

I met a first-rate fan, a complete stranger, in a teahouse. We struck up a conversation, and he was so talkative, his emotions overflowing, and with such insightful opinions.

He said: Not just after the war, but even long before it, football, this sacred sport, has long been a perverted sports "valve," a tool for doing business! Now that living is becoming increasingly constricted, even "football stars" have been turned into commodities. Since the skills sold by "athletes" vary in quality, this also determines the price of this individual talent!

Of course, I cannot completely deny that there are those who truly play sports for the sake of sports, but in an atmosphere where the playing field is the marketplace, most people have a subconscious "if you don't do it, you're not a hero" mentality and dare not try anything easily. Those who "protect their own wisdom" avoid causing controversy, so they prefer to stand by and act as spectators. As a result, there are fewer and fewer friends who really understand how to run sports, and the team has been messed up into the current situation.

The same player, under the "pull" and "lure" of two clubs, can sell himself before the procedures are completed, refuse to attend, give up being selected, and be unwilling for his club's players to participate in local competitions to avoid injury. Even for the sake of not wanting to expand expenses and saving "players," the team is incomplete. Although it is said that 30 percent of these strange phenomena have real reasons, I dare to guarantee that 70 percent are due to the unpleasant phenomena caused by the factors of "not being able to bear losses" and "not wanting to be used by others."

The existence of a sports organization is sacred in principle, but because of the income from tickets, it has aroused the prejudice of some who have a unique business sense. After several calculations of the ins and outs of this income, the desire for profit is alarming, so it has led to the deformed development of pulling strings. The athletes who possess the skills cannot help but "understand the advantages and disadvantages" and wait for the price to be sold, choosing the best offer. Thus, there are three types of football in Hong Kong: 1. Transcendent amateurism, 2. Vague semi-professionalism, 3. Open professionalism.

The first type, in terms of the nature of the club, does not care about winning or losing, welcomes those who come, does not retain those who leave, and does not insist on winning championships. This detached style, of course, has achieved some technical contributions from many groups in terms of technical advancement. The reason is that there are too few truly staunch and self-confident talents. Even if they work hard, they will have a little improvement. However, little do they know, the mantis is behind them. The organizers hold this feeling of not being worthy of making wedding clothes for others, so they are perfunctory and lack the heavenly duty of helping others and helping themselves. Their abandonment of their posts is also a negative organization that blocks talent.

The second type can be said to be a sports organization that specializes in manufacturing murky news in the sports world. Because it is half-open and half-closed, it certainly absorbs a group of famous players of various levels. The talent is the most complicated, and the methods are also chaotic and disorganized. The organizers cage them with various different faces and tricks, and they are uneasy morning and evening. Even if one or two new blood are suddenly discovered, the preferential treatment is unequal, or the person in charge deliberately makes a mystery, which eventually leads to resignation without saying goodbye, abandonment of attendance, or in a state of wavering of bargaining, there is simply no way to develop the concrete tactics of the entire team.

The third type should represent the measuring instrument of the overall local technical level. The organization is of course the most sound, and the capital should be the most abundant. Even if you use a business eye to estimate, the result should also be "fame and fortune." However, the fact is still not as optimistic as that. I believe the organizers still cannot escape "crying bitterly," complaining and blaming themselves. The problem is that Hong Kong already lacks first-class foreign teams as opponents. What about the internal strife between the Chinese? The essence of Hong Kong has been divided too clearly. The relative strength between veterans and new recruits is far different. One-sided, there is no value to appreciate. The audience is not interested, and income is of course affected. Therefore, the huge expenses may not be able to be compensated easily. In terms of technology, it is getting worse and worse. To be honest, the refinement of technology is honed from hard struggle. In a competition where you can do whatever you want, how can the level of football not go downhill?

These declining phenomena can be said to be bad traditions passed down from the entire sports social structure. If this evil custom exists for one day, the level of football technology cannot be improved for one day. I think that in the current football world, if there are not enough talents and teams to be fully professional, the Sports Association should stand up and make the greatest effort to urge the organs to implement the equal distribution system of players, award players with suitable occupations, and make a fixed and reasonable adjustment to the relationship with the parent club. The club should use the money obtained from sports for sports, and the players should delve deeply in the spirit of further study. Under the goal of equal strength of each club, they should learn from each other. Everyone should take football technology as the premise. Whether Hong Kong football has brilliant achievements depends on whether our group, who stands in the sports post, can constantly reflect and review! (You Xinnong from Xiangdao)

Free Talk

### Talking about Folk Songs

— Sang

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, folk songs from various places—especially Mongolia and Xinjiang—were also brought to the Jiangnan region of Jinghu (Nanjing and Shanghai) along with the demobilization. Folk songs are the healthy voice of the nation. Not only can you see the customs and geographical environment of a place in the lyrics, but also in its composition, you can see the national character and simple culture of the local people. For example, Mongolian and Xinjiang folk songs often have nouns such as camels and grasslands. Folk songs from Suiyuan often mention the city walls of the Great Wall.

The tunes of folk songs are very simple, and its accompanying instruments are equally simple. Because the occurrence of folk songs was originally on the great prairie, the sandy shores, or in the mountains, and was produced by the response of the crowd. Therefore, although most folk songs cannot escape the love between men and women, they only have a simple, original taste, and there is no yellow ingredient mixed in.

Recently, many orthodox musicians have also gradually paid attention to and studied these folk songs. The "Running Horse Liuliu," "Shali Hongba Ai," and "Youth Dance Music" sung by Madam Guan are an indication of this trend. It is a pity that when Shanghai people sing folk songs, they often bring a bit of "靡靡" (decadent) sound, which not only disappoints the painstaking efforts of the promoters but also completely loses the meaning of folk songs.

Some musicians, in addition to collecting folk songs from the folk community, also want to promote it using the "taking the result as the cause" method. That is, first make lyrics and scores according to the local people's feelings, and then promote them to the folk community. "Everyone Sings" and "Teahouse Serenade" are the products of this method.

If this method is undertaken by composers who truly go deep into the folk community, it will of course be a powerful help to folk songs; otherwise, it will inevitably become affected and pretentious. Even more, there are some philistine music vendors who take advantage of this opportunity to add a lot of yellow elements, which not only negates the advantages of folk songs but also is a major obstacle to the future of folk songs.

### Can Divorce Be Avoided?

— Binzhi

Divorce is an unfortunate event in families. Although it is legally permissible, it always feels a bit unpleasant in terms of human feelings. Even judges, when dealing with such cases, must infuse some emotional factors and never easily let a couple who were originally in love be separated.

Keninghan is a judge who, from his experience, has come to a conclusion on handling divorce cases: mediation from family relationships is more effective than trial in court. He tried his theory in the 77 divorce cases he handled in a month, and as a result, 18 cases were completely reconciled; in 35 cases, he asked them to cohabit for one or two months, and they were also reconciled later; only 24 estranged couples were really unable to reconcile and had to divorce.

When Keninghan hears divorce cases, he first asks the man and woman whether there is a possibility of reconciliation. If one party believes that reconciliation is possible, he will not ask further questions. He takes the couple and their lawyers to another room for negotiations. However, the parents of the man and woman are not allowed to participate. Keninghan may be able to say that the couple will get back together within 15 minutes. He uses various opportunities to explain the possible encounters after divorce. To the woman, he says: If you remarry after divorce, will the new husband be dissatisfied, jealous, or abuse the children born to your ex-husband? Can you tolerate it? To the man, he says: After the divorce, you have to pay alimony to your ex-wife, and at the same time, the family expenses cannot be reduced, which will increase your burden. At the same time, your second wife will give you trouble because you have to pay your ex-wife alimony. However, this kind of talk is not very effective for young couples who have no children. They do not believe in the various troubles and pains after divorce, so they often cause disputes, and the result is divorce.

Using Keninghan's method, according to himself, whether mediation can succeed depends on the first 15 minutes. If during this period, both parties still believe that there is no possibility of reconciliation, and one party is too emotional, there is little hope of reconciliation. The easiest to handle are young couples with children. Once, a young couple glared at each other when they came in, but were exceptionally loving when they went out. They said to Keninghan: We have forgotten the scene when we came in just now.

### The Qin Mirror

— Xiao Kangshi

Miscellaneous Records of the Western Capital contains a passage about the treasures of the Qin Palace, saying: "When Gaozu entered the Xianyang Palace, he walked around the treasury, and the gold, jade, and treasures were countless. There was a square mirror, four feet wide and five feet nine inches high, with clear surfaces inside and out. When people came to look directly at it, their shadows would be seen upside down. If they came with their hands touching their hearts, their intestines, stomach, and five internal organs would be seen clearly without any obstruction. If a person had a disease inside, they would cover their heart and look at it, and they would know where the disease was. Also, if a woman had evil intentions, her gall would be dilated and her heart would beat. Emperor Qin Shi Huang often used it to look at the palace women, and those whose gall was dilated and whose hearts beat would be killed. Gaozu used it to deal with Xiang Yu, who took it to the east with him, and its whereabouts are unknown." According to this record, it is a bit like today's "X-ray," and it can see the "evil intentions of women," so its effectiveness is even greater than "X-ray." It is a pity that Xiang Yu took it to the east, and its whereabouts are unknown. Otherwise, it could be used to illuminate the "conscience" of today's people. Does it exist? Is it white or black? If one were hung on a main thoroughfare, overlooking all living beings, I think it would be pitch black.

### The Contradiction of Rationing Certificates

— Tanke

The rice rationing certificates for March require the exchange of the "No. 7" shopping certificate on the national identity card. In addition to the joy that the shopping certificate has finally "been used," the common people feel a little inexplicable about this redundant move by the government.

A total of 15 市斤 (a unit of weight) of rice is rationed per month. In order to learn about fashion (price increases), the 15 市斤 of rationed rice are distributed in three distributions in order to track market prices and have some flexibility, - in fact, of course, there is only stretching and no shrinking, and this is not mentioned, because at least there is some reason. Only this trick of exchanging rationing certificates with shopping certificates is too confusing. Since you have to get the rice rationing certificate with the shopping certificate, and it must be No. 7, then why not just directly ration the rice with the shopping certificate? What is the purpose of this extra move? Could it be that there are two No. 7 shopping certificates on everyone's national identity card? If it is said that rice is still distributed three times, is it not enough to use the twelve shopping certificates scheduled per month?

This move, in terms of preventing fraud, can be said to be 100% empty. Rationing rice directly with the shopping certificate will not cause the merchants who print the rationing certificate to close down. Would it not be much better to transfer this printing paper cost to meaningful and necessary expenses!

### Happiness

— Cheng

There is such a proverb in England: If you want an hour of happiness, you go and drink; if you want three days of happiness, then get married; if you want eight days of happiness, then kill and eat your pig. But if you want eternal happiness, then become a gardener.

### Trivia of Literary Men

— Sang

English poet Kipling, at the peak of his career, received as much as one shilling per word for his manuscripts.

French prolific writer Balzac, who has the reputation of "Napoleon of Literature," often had to revise his drafts up to ten times. He was in debt all year round, so he had to dare to go out only at night.

"Russian Maupassant" Chekhov admitted that half of his literary activities were to subsidize household expenses and complete his studies, and half were purely entertainment.

Italian writer D'Annunzio can be considered the most superstitious, so superstitious that he did not even dare to wash his hair on Fridays.

Zola often went hungry when he first started his literary career, and even had to spend the winter wearing only one set of underwear.

Maeterlinck liked stimulation, so his hobbies were boxing and driving cars and motorcycles. He hated music, but often attended concerts to appreciate women.

American writer Edgar Allan Poe was simply crazy about the night. As soon as it dawned, he immediately blocked the windows and lit candles in the room, and then continued to work or read. After nightfall, he began to go out for a walk.

### Love Tester

— Wang Deyun

A report in Reuters, Bavaria, 7th dispatch: "A love tester is on sale here... This tester can test the love between men and women," and so on.

"Love between men and women" can actually be "tested" by machines, which is really "scientific omnipotence." I think that scientist probably invented this because there are too many men and women who "fall in love at first sight" and can't wait to get married five minutes later.

If it is really effective and can be shipped to Shanghai, I think there will definitely be a lot of people who want to buy it; although it costs "five marks per unit, which is seven shillings and six pence in British gold," it cannot be considered too expensive, because there are many rich people in Shanghai. Moreover, the more money people have, the more their "love" is worth doubting, so it is very possible to "test" it, I think.

### Strange Things Under Heaven

— Yu

According to the new regulations of the Mexican Civil Aviation Administration, foreign passengers are not allowed to hug and kiss local relatives and friends who welcome them when they disembark. This policy has also become popular in London. According to the official reason, foreign passengers often secretly hand over nylon stockings, watches, cosmetics, and other smuggled goods to relatives and friends who welcome them when they hug and kiss, so this kind of smuggling kissing must be prohibited.

American department stores have recently been selling Chinese-style women's folding fans in large quantities, with prices ranging from 50 cents to 50 US dollars per fan. For the purpose of promoting sales, merchants have compiled a fabricated "fan language." For example: "Touching the lips with a fan is to attract a man's kiss," "Dropping a fan is equal to saying that I must meet you alone," "Quickly folding the fan is equal to saying that you are too bold," and so on.

Charles of North Dakota, USA, is probably the person in the world who can write the smallest font. In his recent tour exhibition, he used a hair only three inches long to write Lincoln's Gettysburg Address on the hair, with a total of 1175 letters. Using a microscope to see it, it is clearly distinguishable.

The police department of Atlanta City, USA, recently notified all fashion stores in the city that when they change clothes for the models in the glass windows, they must put down the awnings to avoid injuring the customs.

### Bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union

— Xuren

A: Today, China's foreign policy should not be unilaterally pro-American, nor should it be unilaterally pro-Soviet. It should act as a bridge between them.

B: Your opinion is too dangerous.

A: How do you see it?

B: Although the United States and the Soviet Union are in a cold war today, they have not yet reached the point of fighting with swords and guns. This is because they are separated by a Pacific Ocean. If we become a bridge between them, wouldn't they be able to fight each other with bare blades?

### Wine Brick and Shifang Tobacco

— Chen Yixian

Last year, at the end of the year, Huang Tongwu came down from Guling to Shanghai and invited me to drink at his house. After sitting down, the dishes included dried meat stewed with loach, diced meat stir-fried with Jiangxi fermented black beans, and his wife's own wind-dried chicken and drunken crab. Each person had a very small wine glass in front of them (this glass has a special name called "One Mouth Clear"), but no wine was to be seen. A tall, gray brick was placed beside the table, and it felt extremely hard to the touch. The host took out a small foreign knife from his pocket, cut off a corner of the brick, removed the skin, placed it in a teacup, and poured boiling water over it. After a short while, the aroma of wine rushed into my nose. After waiting for the brick to completely melt and settle, he poured it into the small wine glass with a teaspoon and drank it. It was fragrant, mellow, and potent, truly the best Fen wine from Shanxi. Tongwu said, "People in Shanxi make wine in the summer. They put the brick into the first batch of wine to soak for about half a day, then take it out and put it under the hot sun to dry. The bricks from Shanxi are even sturdier than those made by people from Shandong, so they don't melt. After drying, they are put back into the wine pot to soak. They do this more than ten times, and the alcohol is completely absorbed into the brick. When going on a long trip, carrying a few bricks is convenient because you have good wine to drink and they are easy to carry." Tongwu's ancestors once had a ticket shop in Xiantao Town, Shashi, Hubei, and those in charge were from Jiexiu and Pingyao counties in Shanxi. Although the ticket shop has closed down, they still have contact with people from Shanxi, so I was able to taste his brick-infused Fen wine.

The brain and meat stewed loach soup was extremely rich and had no muddy taste. Surprised, I asked about it. Tongwu said, "Whenever you eat sea loach, you must first put them in a water basin and raise them for two or three days, changing the clean water frequently, until they have completely expelled the mud from their stomachs before cooking them. Only then can you get their unique flavor."

After the meal, while chatting casually, his wife took out a long paper package from the inner room. Opening it, it contained tobacco leaves wrapped in vegetable leaves. Each leaf was folded, and when unfolded, it was about two feet long and as thick as a finger. She took two or three leaves, cut them into several sections, removed the veins from the leaves, rolled them up, and glued them together, instantly creating several cigars. Smoking them, they tasted fragrant and rich, no different from Cuban cigars. Tongwu said that these were Shifang leaves from Sichuan (near Chengdu), sent by his sworn brother from Guan County.
