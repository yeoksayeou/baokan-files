### Chennault Appeals for Aid at U.S. Congressional Foreign Aid Oversight Committee Meeting to Prevent China from Falling Under Communist Rule

[Dispatch from This Newspaper] Washington, 3rd (Broadcast): Senator McClellan, Chairman of the Senate and House Foreign Aid Oversight Committee, told reporters that General Chennault strongly advocated at a secret meeting of the committee that the United States immediately provide the Chinese National Government with military and economic aid to prevent the Chinese mainland from falling under Communist rule. He estimated that this aid would require 350 million U.S. dollars. Chen said: "If we use the same amount of money as we used for the Berlin Airlift to aid the Chinese government, the Chinese mainland can be preserved." McClellan said: Unless the United States helps the National Government resist the CCP, East Asia may be shrouded in a new "Iron Curtain". McClellan also stated that Chennault pointed out that seven provinces in China would never surrender to the CCP and would "fight to the end". Chen said that President Chiang was a person unanimously followed by the entire population under the National Government. Since 1945, Chiang's government has not received military aid from the United States, and the equipment received at that time has been exhausted or damaged. Chen said: "To my knowledge, very little of the equipment we have supplied has fallen into the hands of the CCP." Chen predicted that if the CCP succeeds in China, it will drive straight into Vietnam and advance towards India. Chen did not advocate sending American troops to China, but said that the United States should send military delegations and government representatives to China to directly distribute American aid.

### U.S. Government Should Immediately Find Ways to Stop the Soviet Union from Controlling China

Texas Senate Passes Bill

[United Press Dispatch from Austin, Texas, 3rd] The Texas State Senate unanimously passed a bill on the 2nd, requesting the U.S. government to immediately stop Stalin from controlling China. The bill stated that those in the State Department and diplomatic circles who have always regarded the Soviet Union as a peace-loving democracy and the Chinese Communist Party as land reformers unrelated to Moscow, and who have led our country into its current predicament, should all be dismissed by the U.S. government. If we allow the Chinese people to be enslaved by Stalin today and become vassals, it may drag the United States into war, not only fighting for security but also fighting for survival, to maintain the results of its victory in World War II, for which it sacrificed hundreds of thousands of lives. The bill was unanimously passed by the House of Representatives last Friday and will soon be sent to the President, Secretary of State, and Texas representatives in Congress.

### U.S. Congressman Suggests Sending Personnel to China for Investigation

[United Press Dispatch from New York, 3rd] Republican Congressman Nixon of the House Un-American Activities Committee proposed on the 2nd that a committee be sent to China by the Senate and House of Representatives to investigate and determine U.S. policy towards China. Nixon declared at a luncheon of the Anti-Communist League of American Jews that American foreign policy can no longer be entrusted to those who decided the Yalta and Tehran agreements. The State Department should announce that it will not provide aid to the Chinese Communist Party and the Communist coalition government, and abandon the claim that Chinese communism is different from other countries. It must be known that communism is the same in all countries of the world.

### Spokesperson for Badger Claims U.S. Navy Continues Business as Usual

### Soviet Union Tests Peace in Berlin to Divert U.S. Attention; Judd Strongly Argues China War Cannot Be Ignored

[United Press International Dispatch from Washington, 2nd] Republican Congressman Judd accused the Soviet Union on the 2nd of testing peace in Berlin only to shift America's attention while it takes over the Asian continent.

Judd strongly argued that the war in China is the key to struggles in Greece, Turkey, Iran, and elsewhere. The Soviet policy aims to focus American attention on Europe so that the Soviet Union can advance in Asia. Europe has been burned and must rely on the products of resource-rich areas to live, and the Soviet Union is now occupying resource-rich areas. Judd also criticized former Secretary of State Marshall as "just a soldier" with no diplomatic background and mistakenly believed that the Chinese Communist Party could be made to join a coalition government. Although China is in distress, "we will need China in the future more urgently than China needs us today."

Judd believes that the main expansion target of the Soviet Union is in Asia, and Soviet leaders have used tricks to concentrate most of America's attention and efforts on Europe. The Truman administration concentrates all possible power in the hands of the administrative chief and a small team of palace guards, i.e., advisors. This trend threatens to establish a dictatorship in the United States. The President and his palace guards set policy and demand that Congress sign on the dotted line.

### Attlee Reissues Statement on "Amethyst" Incident; Britain Not Considering Recognition of the CCP Regime

[Reuters Dispatch from London, 2nd] Prime Minister Attlee reissued a statement in the House of Commons on the 2nd in response to questions from members of Parliament regarding the British warship "Amethyst" incident. Attlee stated that the British naval commander in the Far East could have requested assistance from the British Air Force to cover the British warships sailing up the Yangtze River after the CCP shelled the "Amethyst," but the British naval commander in the Far East did not take this action. Attlee said that he approved of the commander's decision. Attlee also emphasized and reiterated that the "Amethyst" was carrying out a peaceful mission in accordance with long-standing practices, and there was no question of forcibly passing through the Yangtze River. Attlee also explained that the closest British Air Force fighters to the Yangtze River were in Malaya, 2,000 miles away, and the entire journey would take 36 to 40 hours. Conservative MP Taylor pointed out that the entire situation changed immediately after the Amethyst became the target of CCP artillery fire, as this was an act of piracy. Was it not necessary to use aircraft to cover other British warships sailing up the river? Attlee replied that the local commander believed that the procedure that should be taken was to send warships up the river as quickly as possible, hoping to rescue the British Amethyst under peaceful conditions.

[Reuters Dispatch from Hong Kong, 3rd] A naval spokesperson here claimed that a Chinese envoy had notified the commander of the British warship Amethyst, which was trapped in the Yangtze River, that the ship must remain in place and not move because the Yangtze River area was still in a state of war. The Chinese envoy referred to by the spokesperson was likely an envoy from the CCP. He also said that the British Navy does not intend to move the ship until both sides of the Chinese civil war can guarantee the ship's safe passage. The British naval authorities have so far been unable to contact any central CCP authorities to negotiate the ship's safe passage.

[Reuters Dispatch from London, 2nd] A British Foreign Office spokesperson, commenting on the Washington Post's criticism of Britain's policy towards the CCP, said that the question of recognizing the CCP regime has not yet arisen and is not currently under consideration.

### Understanding the "May Fourth" Movement - Statement by Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the Central Cultural Movement Committee

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd] Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the Central Cultural Movement Committee, recently issued an article entitled "Understanding the 'May Fourth' Movement," excerpts of which are as follows:

"The May Fourth Movement is the most glorious page in the modern revolutionary history of China. Every year we commemorate 'May Fourth,' and every year we should reflect upon it.

The distant cause of the "May Fourth" Movement was the cultural trend of the Three Principles of the People, which stirred and shaped the era. After the corruption of the Qing Dynasty, intellectuals generally felt the crisis of the nation and the country, rose up vigorously, and carried out a self-salvation movement. Kang Youwei's "Petition of the Scholars by Public Transportation" called on the scholar-bureaucrats to rise up and discuss politics, which resulted in the Reform Movement. However, because the goal of the movement at that time went astray into the wrong path of constitutional monarchy, and the participants in this movement were only scholar-bureaucrats and not popularized among intellectuals of various classes, the movement soon failed. Dr. Sun Yat-sen raised the banner of the Three Principles of the People to promote the National Revolution. The direction was extremely correct, and the in-depth propaganda of the party members enabled it to be popularized among people of all classes. Therefore, intellectual youths and leading figures in the ideological circles were able to have revolutionary awareness. As a result, the "May Fourth" Movement, a glorious historical event, was developed. Therefore, even today, when we commemorate "May Fourth," we must not forget the source of the water we drink, and we should make our greatest efforts for the Three Principles of the People.

The essence of the "May Fourth" Movement initially stemmed from military campaigns. The advocates were figures like Zeng Guofan, Zuo Zongtang, and Li Hongzhang. Their goal was to build cannons, train the navy, and set up shipyards, which was then known as the Westernization Movement. However, military affairs were only one part of politics. Since politics had not been reformed, military affairs also came to nothing, and the military expenses that were collected at that time were used extravagantly for the Summer Palace. After the failure of the New Military Movement, there came the New Political Movement of Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, etc., who attempted to save the fate of the Qing Dynasty with the magic charm of constitutional monarchy. However, politics cannot be separated from the people's livelihood, nor can it be divorced from culture. It is futile to try to reform politics without reforming culture. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen criticized the above two movements as methods of addressing the symptoms rather than the root cause. He thus created the New Cultural Movement of the Three Principles of the People, hoping to accomplish the political revolution and the social revolution in one battle. After the May Fourth Movement occurred, Dr. Sun Yat-sen rectified its name, saying, "This is a new cultural movement." Only when this new cultural movement is unfolded can the National Revolution develop at an accelerated pace. Therefore, even today when we commemorate May Fourth, we should know that the movement to save the country and ensure its survival is fundamentally based on the new cultural movement. In recent years, however, the Communists have brought out another set of theories of the New Economic Movement, which is what is called the economic historical view or the materialist historical view. Regardless of their actions, they only show the great destruction of production without any new economic construction, which is already a mismatch between name and reality. Even if the Communists currently have some military advantages, their end will inevitably be destroyed due to cultural failure. And the so-called New Economic Movement will inevitably repeat the mistakes of the New Military Movement and the New Political Movement. The slogans of the May Fourth Movement were science and democracy. Under these two high-sounding words, a new atmosphere of the entire academic and social community was created. Today, science and democracy have encountered great crises. Science is anti-dogmatic, but the Communists regard Marxism-Leninism as the Bible. Democracy is anti-autocratic, but the Communists want to drive the people into the iron curtain of autocracy. If the Communists are really lucky for a while, then our science and democracy movement will regress for decades, which is truly a great misfortune for culture. If we want to commemorate "May Fourth," we must raise the banner of science and democracy again and fight to the end against the dogmatism and totalitarian regime of the Communists.

Finally, the direct cause of the "May Fourth" Movement was to resist foreign aggression and eliminate warlords at home. Because the righteous intimidation of intellectual youths forced the Northern Warlords to change their traitorous diplomacy, this matter is recorded in history and need not be repeated. However, what we cannot help but lament is that, to this day, the new warlords of the Communist Party are colluding with new aggressors to enslave our nation and country. At the time of the "May Fourth" Movement, intellectual youths were still able to sacrifice themselves, run around and shout, and fight against the warlords and aggressors. But to this day, they have done everything they can to be silent, tolerant, and submissive to these new warlords and new aggressors. Even worse, they are intimidated by the power of violence and supported by the temptation of rubles, and thus make insincere propaganda for these new warlords and aggressors, or willingly provide their instructions, and have even fallen to the pawns of the Fifth Column, without knowing shame. Now the voice of justice has subsided. While commemorating May Fourth, we should awaken the soul of the May Fourth Movement, take out the banner of nationalism again, and launch a thorough counterattack against the Communists who are the new warlords and the communism that is the new aggression. Intellectual youths, this is the time for us to fight together. Our nation will never be enslaved, and our country will never perish. The final effort will surely achieve the final victory."

### Editorial: Classes First!

Troubles are widespread and have finally reached Shanghai. She has put on her battle clothes and is preparing for the worst. From the looks of it, Shanghai still needs to wait for some time before it hears the sound of artillery fire. The authorities have repeatedly expressed their determination and confidence to defend Shanghai. However, under this situation, education, which is tied to the lifeline of the nation, has become an extremely serious problem, forcing us to issue sincere appeals to the government, teachers, students, and society, requesting everyone to respect this sacred cause.

The newly appointed Mayor Chen Liang, who came from the teaching profession, deeply understands the importance of education and has personally tasted the bitterness of a teacher's life. Therefore, when the city treasury was as empty as a washbasin, other salaries were delayed, but the education funds were scraped together and given first. He also loudly appealed, "Education for education's sake." Which won applause from the people of the whole city. Currently, just to maintain education and to ensure that teachers are fed is already extremely tragic. The day before yesterday, representatives of municipal schools visited the Mayor and the Director of Education, putting forward six demands: (1) Issue two piculs of "respect-teacher rice" to each person; (2) Clear all salary and allowances for this semester in one go; (3) Clear all arrears of in-kind payments or convert them into cash at market prices; (4) Provide rice and non-staple food allowances to normal school students and boarding students in advance; (5) Prepare transportation costs for relocation in the suburbs and north of the Suzhou Creek; (6) Promptly pay water and electricity bills in accordance with Instruction No. 4964. These matters are all reasonable and should be resolved. As for dispersing homeless teachers and students from schools and centralizing the management of students, reasonable arrangements should also be made.

The government should fulfill its responsibilities to teachers; teachers should also hold their positions in education. When we read Daudet's "The Last Lesson," we see how great the teacher's spirit is. Although the situation in Shanghai is sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed, and people are in a state of panic, teachers are, after all, leaders of the people. They must calm their hearts, think about our next generation, and attend classes as usual, which is a matter of course. Teaching is a teacher's second life, and there is no room for evasion. When we look at the various acts of rebellion today, educators should think about the fact that education has not been carried out. "When education is carried out, propriety and righteousness will flourish, and customs will be beautiful." Teachers are the ones who implement education. If they do not fulfill their responsibility of "transforming the people and shaping customs," then it will become empty talk. If their minds are filled with gold and US dollars as the most important things, then people will naturally worship "Big Brother" and "Second Brother" as God. Guan Zhong's saying in the Yi Zhi Chapter that "when the granaries are full, people know etiquette; when food and clothing are sufficient, people know honor and disgrace" refers to ordinary people, not teachers. A teacher "seeks the Way, not food." He should be like the great master Dong Zhongshu of the Western Han Dynasty, "rectify his righteousness, not seek his benefit, clarify his Dao, not calculate his merit." Master Wang Chuanshan elaborated on the order of food, clothing, integrity, and shame: "To say that integrity and shame arise after food and clothing are sufficient, and that ritual and righteousness are created after wealth and goods are abundant, is to grasp the symptoms and seek the root... " This kind of teacher spirit, which has been obtained and lost again, must be found back. Going to school and attending classes is a responsibility of conscience, and it is what children and young people are begging for, ahead of teachers.

Today, the psychology of young students is like that during the National Revolution in 1926. If there is proper autonomy and effort in one's position, not only will one not suffer, but the school will also benefit greatly. However, young students, full of youthful energy, have witnessed the corruption of officials and the distress of the people, and have forgotten their own stand. They do not know that studying is a student's duty, and they frequently go on strike, creating an unprecedented chaotic phenomenon in the education field. If this continues without finding a way to correct it, then the future of the second generation is truly worrying. How can we hope that the youth of the future will accomplish great things and establish great careers with people who are ignorant and unskilled? Listening to the words of teachers and following the teachings of sages will benefit them endlessly throughout their lives. Righteous teachers will never lead you to burn incense in a temple without a Buddha. All the students are the future talents of the nation, and we must treat these formidable youths with a responsible attitude and find the hope of a newly emerging China in them.

The current situation of attending classes in various schools is too bad. Sometimes there are few teachers and many students, sometimes there are few students and many teachers, and sometimes teachers have nothing to do all day long because there are no students to teach, or students wander around the school and have no classes to attend all day long. This is indeed because everyone is busy moving and fleeing, or worrying about the vague future, or because the heavy burden of life is overwhelming. It is a matter of pity, and there is a reason for it. But how can this state of affairs be allowed to continue? It is not a blessing for young children! We have already spoken to the government, teachers, and students. Now, we would like to ask the society to take responsibility for educating the next generation. Parents and members of society should urge their children to attend school or transfer to another school as usual, and strictly educate and supervise them, not allowing them to idle around and do nothing. At the same time, we hope that they will help schools and teachers solve the difficulties that the government cannot solve, or at least not increase their difficulties. Paying tens of thousands of dollars in administrative fees makes the school's finances difficult by a hundred thousand times, in order to alleviate the immediate crisis and save education from collapse. Without the fact of school closures, do not issue news of school closures, disturbing teachers and students and causing them to be demoralized. The resolution of the meeting of municipal secondary and higher education principals this time is: "Please ask the Education Bureau to send letters to all daily and evening newspapers in the city, stating that any news about school closures must be released after obtaining the press release issued by the Education Bureau." This is worth noting. In short, education is a matter for the country and also a matter for society. Please everyone respect this sacred cause together!

### Jessup and Malik Meet Again - The Berlin Blockade Can Be Lifted Immediately - The Date of the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference is Still to be Agreed

[Report from this newspaper] London, broadcast on the 3rd: If Malik accepts Jessup's invitation, the four powers will discuss the lifting of the Berlin blockade and the date for convening a four-power foreign ministers' conference today. It is reported that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France have reached an agreement on the procedure for lifting the blockade and convening a four-power conference. The four powers have now agreed to hold a foreign ministers' conference in Paris, but the date for lifting the blockade and convening the Paris conference is still to be discussed and decided. The three Western powers have suggested convening the foreign ministers' conference on May 23. It is reported that Malik suggested lifting all restrictions on a certain day within the second week of June. The three Western powers hope to designate May 9 as the day when the four powers simultaneously lift all obstacles set up by both sides since March 26, 1948. It is reported that the Soviet Union suggested that both sides simultaneously lift all restrictions one week before the convening of the foreign ministers' conference. If today's meeting can be held as scheduled, it is expected that the representatives of the four powers will simultaneously discuss the issuance of a communique by the four powers, announcing the decision of the four powers to resume negotiations on the German issue. Regarding whether Malik has the authority to directly decide on the agreement on various dates, or whether he must ask Moscow for instructions on the Western proposal before making a decision, London officials cannot determine at this moment.

[United Press, New York, 3rd] It is expected that the three Western powers will submit to the Soviet Union a plan to end the Berlin blockade by the end of this week on the 3rd. Diplomatic sources said that if the Soviet Union accepts the above plan, then the Berlin blockade and counter-blockade will be lifted from May 11 to 14, and the four-power conference will be convened in Paris around May 25. According to the well-informed sources, the above plan will be submitted by Jessup, the United States Ambassador-at-Large, to Malik, the chief representative of the Soviet Union at the United Nations. The above plan was drafted by Jessup, Cadogan, the United Nations representative of the United Kingdom, and Chauvel, the representative of France, on the 2nd. It is reported that the Western proposal includes the following points: (1) Jessup, Cadogan, and Chauvel are prepared to start four-power negotiations here with Malik "at any time in the next few days." After February 15, Jessup and Malik had already started direct negotiations on the Berlin issue. (2) The Western countries support the simultaneous lifting of the Berlin Soviet blockade and the Western counter-blockade next week. (3) The Western countries agree to decide on the date of the four-power foreign ministers' conference to be convened in Paris to discuss the German issue, which will be held in about two weeks.

[Associated Press, New York, 2nd] The US representative Jessup met with the British representative Cadogan and the French representative Chauvel for about an hour today to discuss and determine a common attitude towards the conditions for lifting the Berlin blockade proposed by the Soviet Union. After the meeting, the representatives of the three countries issued a communique stating that the discussion "progressed smoothly," but it was not stated whether the opinions of the three countries were consistent. In general, it still awaits final approval from the governments of each country. A spokesman for the US delegation said that there would be no contact with the Soviet representative Malik until Wednesday to submit the written reply from the three countries. Jessup went to Washington at the end of last week to report on the progress of the negotiations to Secretary of State Acheson, and after meeting with Acheson in the morning today, he took a plane to this place to convene a meeting of the three countries. According to reliable sources, Jessup will be able to meet with Malik in one or two days, at which time the final decision on the lifting of the Berlin blockade can be made. The full text of the communique of today's meeting of the three countries reads, "Since the start of the negotiations between Jessup and Malik, the British and French representatives have received full reports at any time. The representatives of the three Western countries also meet from time to time to exchange views on the progress of these informal negotiations. Today's meeting is just one of them. Each four-power negotiation requires a considerable amount of time, and this one is no exception, especially since the capitals of three of them are far away. What can be said is that the negotiations are proceeding satisfactorily, as on Friday night. However, in order to avoid misunderstandings, the content of today's discussion is not convenient to publish in advance."

### The US, UK, and France Have a Consistent Position - Willing to Cooperate with the Soviet Union to Solve the German Problem - New Negotiations Should Be Based on the New Situation

[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] Sources said that the US representative Jessup and the Soviet representative Malik are drafting a communique on the lifting of the Berlin blockade and the convening of a four-power conference, and its contents have not yet been submitted to the British and French governments. People here emphasized that the United States, Britain, and France have a consistent position on the German issue. It is reported that the main point that remains to be decided at present is the date of the four-power conference. The Western powers have suggested holding this conference on May 15, while the Soviet Union supports holding it on June 15. French Foreign Minister Schuman also confirmed today that the Soviet Union has accepted the preliminary conditions put forward by the Western countries for resuming four-power negotiations, and the four parties have reached an agreement on convening a four-power conference.

Schuman denied the rumors that Britain, France, and the United States had different opinions on handling this matter. Senior diplomatic figures here believe that when Acheson discussed the Soviet Union's attempt to resolve the Berlin issue with Bevin and Schuman in Washington last month, the opinions of the three men were completely aligned. The United States authorized Jessup to conduct detailed discussions with Malik only after the three powers reached an agreement. It is reported that the opinions of the United States, Britain, and France are roughly as follows:

The Potsdam Agreement Has Expired - The West Holds the Trump Card

Since the Potsdam Agreement, the Soviet Union has adopted a defensive stance for the first time, and it is the turn of the Western countries to take the initiative for the first time. The three countries believe that the Berlin blockade and the Western countries' emphasis on the counter-blockade of East Germany and Eastern Europe have forced the Soviet Union to tend to compromise in the Cold War. It is generally expected that at the upcoming four-power conference, the Soviet Union will propose a decisive plan, demanding the immediate restoration of Germany's unification and the withdrawal of all occupying forces. The Western countries will answer that the withdrawal of troops must wait until the peace treaty is signed. The three powers are willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union to promote the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. At the same time, the three powers will also declare that the Potsdam Agreement has expired, and the new negotiations of the four powers should be based on the new situation, especially on the agreement on West Germany established by the three powers in Washington. For this reason, if the Soviet Union attempts to invoke the Potsdam Agreement, it will inevitably be rejected by the three powers. The three Western powers will welcome the Soviet Union to put forward suggestions so that East Germany can also be merged with the rest of Germany based on the Bonn Constitution. At the same time, the three Western powers will also declare to the Soviet Union that the merger of East Germany with the rest of Germany should be conditional on the existence of democratic conditions in East Germany, such as holding free elections, abolishing the secret police, freedom of speech, free activities for various political parties, and joint supervision by the Allied countries of the implementation of the aforementioned conditions. Western observers predict that the Soviet Union will reject these conditions regarding East Germany. If East Germany cannot be merged with West Germany, then the Western allies may suggest establishing some kind of bridge between East and West Germany. This bridge will be a liaison committee organized purely by Germans in Berlin to handle relations between East and West Germany, especially economic relations. If, unexpectedly, the Soviet Union can agree to the conditions regarding East Germany, it would indeed be one of the greatest victories of the Western countries after the war. Otherwise, if the Berlin Liaison Committee is established, it can at least enable the Western countries to gain a foothold in an area completely controlled by the Soviet Union. In short, as the German issue has developed to this point, it seems that the Western countries hold the trump card in the upcoming four-power negotiations.

### Yugoslavia Requests a Huge Loan from the United States

[United Press, Belgrade, 2nd] According to reliable sources, Yugoslavia is about to request a huge US dollar loan from the United States. According to rumors here, the loan will be approved. According to people here, the Yugoslav government has also requested a private loan from an American bank. American bankers have discussed with the American government whether to approve it. It is reported that the South American embassy in the United States will submit a loan request in the shortest possible time. One person even said, "In fact, this request has already been made." He said that the South American Ambassador to the United States, Kosenwick, had already expressed to the US State Department that the South American country hoped to obtain a US loan, but due to the subtle relationship between Yugoslavia and the Cominform Intelligence Agency, it is still difficult to explore other details of the loan negotiations.

### Bulgaria Establishes a Six-Member Super-Cabinet - Presided Over by Dimitrov

[Agence France-Presse, Sofia, 2nd] The Bulgarian government announced today the establishment of a six-member "super-cabinet," presided over by Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov, who is currently in the Soviet Union. The super-cabinet will be called the "Presidium of the Council of Ministers," and its task is to organize and coordinate Bulgaria's domestic and foreign policies.

### UN General Assembly Passes a Proposal - Forming an International Mediation Group

[US News Service, Lake Success, 2nd] In the near future, the United Nations will register a group of people who may be asked by the United Nations to serve as mediators when disputes arise between two countries. The provision for this mediation group is one of three proposals passed by the United Nations General Assembly, aimed at making the resolution of international disputes more convenient.

### Discussing the Draft Regulations of the European Parliament - The Meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Ten Countries Opens - Bevin Serves as Chairman - The Meeting is Expected to Last About Three Days

[Report from this newspaper] London, broadcast on the 3rd: The agenda of the meeting of the foreign ministers of ten European countries to discuss the European Parliament has changed suddenly today. The issue of Turkey and Greece joining the European Parliament, which was originally scheduled to be discussed on the 3rd, may now be changed to the 4th. It is reported that this change is partly because Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak will not be able to arrive in London until the 4th. The foreign ministers of the ten countries will proceed to discuss the draft regulations of the European Parliament on the 3rd. It is generally hoped that all outstanding issues will be resolved quickly so that the draft regulations can be signed on the 4th or 5th.

[Reuters, London, 3rd] The foreign ministers of ten European countries held a meeting in St. James's Palace today to plan the organization of the European Parliament. The ten countries are the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Ireland, and Italy. They will decide on the charter of the new institution based on the suggestions of the ambassadors of the ten countries recently drafted in London for organizing the European Parliament.

The European Parliament is divided into two parts: the European Parliament and the Committee of Ministers, which were decided to be initiated by the Western European Union Advisory Committee at a meeting in January. This meeting of the foreign ministers of ten countries is chaired by British Foreign Minister Bevin and is expected to last about two to three days. French Foreign Minister Schuman and Italian Foreign Minister Sforza both expressed their satisfaction with the achievements of this conference. Schuman said when he arrived at Victoria Station in London yesterday, "I am very pleased to be here to sign the 'European Charter' with my colleagues from the nine countries. I believe that this is a very important event in the process of international peace and progress." Sforza also said when he got off the train, "I have never been more optimistic about the mission of signing a treaty on any previous trip abroad. We are now truly taking on the mission of organizing Europe."

### The Soviet Union Interferes with American Radio Broadcasts - The United States Lodges a Protest

Sends a Letter to the International Telecommunication Union

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Deputy Secretary of State Allen declared today that the US State Department has lodged a formal protest with the International Telecommunication Union headquarters in Geneva regarding the Soviet Union's disruption of "Voice of America" radio broadcasts, saying that the Soviet Union's move violates four agreements and should be ordered to stop the interference. The United States had previously protested directly to Moscow, but to no avail. The interference has become more severe recently, and the US side believes that the Soviet authorities are trying to deceive the people and prevent them from knowing about the negotiations to lift the Berlin blockade. The Soviet Union is delaying the time and preparing to adopt a new propaganda method for the Berlin issue.

### Romania Asks the UK to Close Two Consulates

[Reuters, London, 3rd] A spokesman for the British Foreign Office said today that Romania has asked the United Kingdom to close its consulates in Cluj and Constanta in Romania, presumably because Romania does not have sufficient consulate facilities. Romania does not have a consulate in the UK.

[Associated Press, Manila, 3rd] Dickinson, the British Charge d'Affaires in the Philippines, fell to his death from a window on the fifth floor of the HSBC Bank here today. Tonight, the police announced that Dickinson's death was due to mental disorder. Three suicide notes, one to the police, one to his wife Gu Du Lin, and one to the British Vice Consul in Manila, Finlay, are sufficient to prove his mental depression. Dickinson was transferred here from Warsaw last November, and the British Embassy is located in the HSBC Building.

### Major Fire in the Manila City - The Chinese Commercial News Was Burned Down

[Central News Agency, Manila, 3rd] A major fire broke out in the city center of Tondo District here on the night of the 2nd. Due to the strong wind, it took more than an hour to extinguish. A total of Chinese Middle School, Chinese Commercial News, Yuanfo Temple, and 15 other civilian houses were burned down. Chinese Commercial News is the oldest Chinese newspaper in the Philippines, with total assets of about 100,000 pesos, but only 50,000 pesos are insured. The newspaper was suspended on the 2nd, and whether it will continue to be published depends on the decision of Yu Changcheng, the publisher who is currently stranded in Xiamen, when he returns here.

### United Nations General Assembly Rushes to Close; Indonesian-Dutch Dispute and Israeli Membership Application Submitted to Special Political Committee for Discussion

It also resolved to refer the question of Israel's participation in the UN to the Special Political Committee for discussion. At the same time, the General Assembly also decided to refer the Indonesian issue to the Special Committee for discussion.

[United Press, Lake Success, 3rd] When the UN General Assembly reconvened today, the steering committee of fourteen nations suggested that the application of Israel for membership be discussed directly by the General Assembly without first going through a subcommittee. This was rejected by the Assembly, and the case was still referred to the Second Political Committee for discussion. The First Political Committee will continue to discuss the issue of Italy's pre-war colonies today, and may insert a discussion on the Spanish question midway.

### Wallace Advocates Trade with Communist China

[United Press, Boston, 2nd] Wallace declared today that the United States should "engage in commerce" with the Chinese Communist Party. Wallace, who is scheduled to address a Progressive Party meeting tonight, told reporters that Communist China will become a threat unless "we correct our errors." Wallace explained that the "errors" he referred to were the methods used by Truman, Churchill, and Vandenberg in handling world problems. Wallace further stated, "If we feel that the way to handle the situation in China is to isolate or suppress them by not engaging in commerce with them, then I can anticipate that Communist China will come up with a method that is infinitely harmful. I personally feel, and have heard many businessmen say, that we can and should engage in commerce with the CCP. If we refuse to engage in commerce with half the world, we will become impoverished. The United States will trade with China unless there are fools at the top levels of the CCP who interfere politically. Otherwise, they will also trade with us. Our understanding and assistance can stabilize China." Wallace also claimed that the North Atlantic Treaty will lead to war, and the Soviets have opened a path to peace in Berlin, which the United States must follow. "We must build a stronger United Nations on the basis of cooperation among the great powers."

### British Policy Towards Spain Unchanged; Opposes Spain's Participation in Any International Organizations; Spain Contacts United States for Construction Loans

[United Press, Madrid, 2nd] Reliable sources said today that Spain is negotiating with the United States Export-Import Bank for a loan of approximately $200 million for construction and reconstruction.

### France Sends 1,000 Troops to Vietnam to Strengthen Defenses

Participants in the meeting will include the United States, Britain, France, India, Indonesia, Thailand, Burma, and Vietnam. The United States believes that before such a conference is held, the Netherlands must foster Indonesian independence, and France must take similar action towards Vietnam to avoid giving the impression that Western countries are supporting colonial policies.

However, Burma must accept the Commonwealth's mediation of the conflict between the country and the Karen people as a prerequisite for receiving this aid.

[United Press, London, 2nd] Indian Prime Minister Nehru had a private dinner with British Foreign Secretary Bevin this afternoon. The details have not been announced, but it is believed that the two discussed the future of Burma. During last week's Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, Nehru raised this issue for Burma.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd] Indian Prime Minister Nehru left here for Bern, Switzerland today. Those who went to the airport to see him off included his sister, Madame Pandit, the Indian High Commissioner to Britain, the Indian Ambassador to Burma, and Indian expatriates.

Subsequently, the issue of aid to Burma was still under consideration and was raised for discussion by the relevant prime ministers at the Commonwealth Conference held in London last week. At the same time, it was heard that most of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers agreed that the Burmese government under Thakin Nu must have funds to prevent its collapse.

### Legislative Procedures in the United States Congress

— By Bateman

During a typical session of the United States Congress, thousands of bills are introduced. To cope with this workload and to properly review each proposal, Congress has established a legislative structure through which all bills must pass before becoming law.

When a proposed law reaches the House of Representatives or the Senate for consideration and voting by all members, it has already undergone thorough consideration to determine whether there is a need to enact it into law, whether the original proposal is appropriate and feasible, and whether it reflects the will of the voters. Typically, its content has been studied by experts inside and outside the government, and the opinions of relevant individuals or groups have been heard and recorded. It has been reviewed or amended by a committee of legislators who are quite familiar with a particular area.

In the previous 75 sessions (note that the current new Congress is the 81st), more than 725,000 bills were introduced. Mainly due to the selective measures inherited by the legislative structure, on average, only one out of every twelve bills becomes law. Most of the bills that are not passed are withdrawn before reaching the general debate in Congress.

Suggestions for legislation often originate outside of Capitol Hill, where Congress is located. A large proportion of bills are the result of requests from the government's administrative agencies. In his annual message to Congress, the President will invariably propose several laws that he considers to be of utmost importance to the welfare of the nation. Each administrative department also proposes some legislative plans in its respective area. Business organizations, consumer groups, labor unions, and agricultural associations also bring their needs to the attention of Congress by maintaining contact with senators and representatives. The same is true for individuals. Many bills are generated by a single legislator or a congressional committee's independent investigation.

In many integrations, preliminary research is conducted before the bill is drafted. Once a bill is drafted, the next step is for a member of the Senate or House to introduce it in a plenary session. The degree of preliminary research varies. It is usually directly proportional to the importance of the bill's subject matter and the number of people and interests involved.

Taking the Marshall Plan as an example, experts from the State Department first conducted extensive research on the proposed European Recovery Program as a preliminary step before Secretary of State Marshall presented his views to the nation in a speech at the Harvard University commencement ceremony.

Later, due to positive public reaction, the entire government apparatus was used to conduct thorough research and investigation. The State Department completed a basic document on all aspects of the plan, "The Outline of European Recovery," which included a draft plan to be submitted to Congress. In addition, a "Harriman Committee" appointed by the President, chaired by Averell Harriman, the current roving ambassador to the Marshall Plan countries, and including financiers, industrialists, private economists, and production experts, presented an exploratory study estimating the needs of the Marshall Plan countries. Two other groups appointed by the President prepared detailed reports totaling one million words on the impact of these needs on the American economy and natural resources.

The House of Representatives, in view of the great significance of the aid to Europe plan, took further action. Before the bill was submitted for public review, a sixteen-member subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee, led by Congressman Herter, traveled to Europe to conduct on-site investigations.

Such intensive preparation is only carried out for very important legislation. Ordinary preliminary investigations are less extensive and are conducted by standing committees appointed by the Speaker of the House or the President of the Senate. Standing committees are central to the legislative process. They are each chaired by a member of the majority party in Congress. The minority party members have a certain proportion of the committee seats, and they are led by the senator or representative with the highest seniority. There are fifteen standing committees in the Senate and nineteen in the House, each responsible for a specific area, including appropriations, agriculture, military affairs, public lands, veterans' affairs, banking and currency, and foreign affairs. The task of the committees is to separate appropriate and inappropriate bills and to draft the bills presented in a more appropriate manner. The fundamental method of investigation is public consultation, with relevant individuals attending to present their views.

A bill may be passed in the committee as it is, or it may be slightly amended or shelved. Shelving often cancels a bill unless a group of congressmen who have proposed the bill in the House vote to force the committee to submit the bill to the whole House for discussion.

Many bills are introduced by the committees themselves. As long as the committee members believe there is a need to enact a law, they can take action. In the previous session of Congress, a subcommittee of the Senate traveled across the country to investigate opinions on housing conditions in various cities, and the information obtained was used as the basis for the housing laws passed by the 80th Congress.

After a bill has been reviewed by a committee and is deemed ready for consideration by all members, it is placed on the legislative calendar for a full debate. All bills must be approved by both houses before becoming law. Often, a proposed measure is passed by one house but rejected by the other, as was the case with the Marshall Plan bill. When this happens, a conference committee composed of members from both houses is selected to study the differences between the two houses and draft an acceptable bill for further consideration and passage by both houses.

Once a bill is approved by Congress, it has passed the final stage of the preliminary sequence. It is printed on parchment and reviewed by the chairmen of the relevant committees of the Senate and House to certify that it is completely correct. After the Speakers of the Senate and House sign the parchment, it is sent to the President for his signature.

If the bill is vetoed by the President, then both houses must reconsider it. But if both houses still pass it with a two-thirds majority, they can override the veto, and the bill can become law without the President's signature. (Translated by the U.S. Information Service)

Today Huamei Plays Lian Zhan Youyi Post Affairs

In the four-time table tennis league, the four Huamei teams played against Qinglian at the Postal Affairs Ball Room the night before. The strength of the two sides was very different. Although it was a one-sided situation, there were still more than 100 spectators. Huamei dismounted and showed its power. Lu Hanjun easily took Li Peiran in two straight sets. Wang Jiuqing used gentleness to overcome strength and defeated the opponent's captain Liu Baotai by two to one. Qinglian was at a loss and the counterattack was ineffective. Tu Youci and Wang Zongze were also attacked by Huamei's Li Zongpei and Qin Duyan. In the last set, Qinglian's Cao Taichang made a mistake, and as a result, Huamei defeated Qinglian by five straight sets. Today (4th), there will be two Grade A matches and four Grade B matches. Huamei will play Lian Zhan Youyi and Post Affairs. Youyi is not Huamei's opponent.

### Rice Market Fluctuations Narrow; Flour and Grains Decline

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, rice prices rose slightly in the South City market and were slightly weaker in the North City market.

White glutinous rice was priced at 20.08 million yuan, and high-quality thin rice was priced at 21.6 million yuan, each up 800,000 yuan from the previous day. Early rice also approached 20 million yuan, and fewer indica rice offerings led to a slight price increase. In the North Rice Market, white glutinous rice and thin rice were each priced at 21.5 million yuan, and early rice was priced at 20 million yuan, down 500,000 to 1 million yuan compared to yesterday.

Flour

Yesterday, affected by the general decline in prices, the market trend also turned downwards. At the initial opening, various brands of flour still hovered at their peaks, but the market ultimately saw users stop buying at high prices, and sales turned sluggish, causing the market to become unsustainable.

Grains

Were weak and unable to recover. Peanut hoarders released their stocks, causing prices to fall by more than 20%. The soybean market was mixed, with a large number of winter beans being sporadically purchased on the street, driving up prices by 10%. Mulberry garden beans and local beans both weakened. Sesame and tea beans traded normally, with prices hovering on a downward trend. Rice sales were brisk, and prices rose by 10%.

### Gold Market Supply Exceeds Demand; Prices Gradually Decline

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday's gold market saw people feeling weak after the garrison headquarters announced the recall of money shop bank drafts. Factories urgently needed funds to pay wages, leading to a large amount of physical gold flowing out. The supply was strong, and the demand was weak. Buyers were scarce. The off-market spot price initially opened at 330 million to 380 million, but it fell all the way to the 100 million range, as low as 190 million to 210 million. It rebounded slightly to 220 million to 250 million at noon. The afternoon market was flat, reaching as high as 240 million to 270 million, but ultimately fell back to 220 million to 250 million.

The US dollar followed the trend in the off-market, with a surge in retail sellers cashing out US dollars for silver, increasing the supply. It opened in the morning at 6.5 million to 7 million, but it fell slightly to 4 million to 4.5 million. The noon price was 4.7 million to 5.2 million. Trading was sluggish, falling as low as 4.5 million to 5 million. The final price was 4.8 million to 5.3 million, a decrease of 30% to 40% compared to the previous day.

Jewelry stores still did not post prices for gold yesterday. Due to the chaotic market, imbalanced supply and demand, and operational difficulties, most jewelry stores had effectively suspended operations. Money changers also did not post prices for transactions. On the street, prices were shouted at 150 million to 200 million for cash transactions.

### Silver Dollar Market Stable; Street Transactions Gradually Decreasing

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday's silver dollar market remained stable. Most businesses were still busy with registration and had mostly stopped trading. Only a few had completed the procedures, obtained licenses, and started buying and selling, all in cash transactions. Bank draft transactions were mostly rejected. Silver dollars (Big Heads) initially traded at 3.7 million to 4 million, gradually falling to 3.4 million to 3.6 million. There was not much fluctuation in the afternoon, and in the evening they were shouted at 3.4 million to 3.7 million. Bank draft transactions initially traded at 6.5 million to 7.5 million, and the final price was shouted at 5 million to 5.5 million, gradually approaching cash prices. Due to the authorities' increased efforts to catch silver touts, street touting had gone underground, and their movements were erratic, making the streets quieter.

Yesterday's gold and silver exchange rate on the stock exchange initially traded at 36 to 39 for the 6th and 7th floors, close to noon it was 34 to 37, and in the afternoon it was 35 to 38.

Gold Bonds Still Rose to the Limit

Yesterday morning, the buying price for gold bonds was shouted at 15.76 million yuan, reaching the upper limit, and no transactions took place. In the afternoon, the buying price was still shouted at the previous day's upper limit, but there were still no transactions.

### Chinese Stocks Weakened; No Transactions in the Trading Room

[Report from Our Newspaper] In the Chinese stock market, there was still a market without transactions in the trading room yesterday. All stocks were called out, opening at the upper limit price, but there were no transactions before or after the market. After the sudden turn in the current situation, the price trends of various off-market goods moved in line with gold and silver. The price fluctuations of Chinese stocks in the trading room were restricted, unable to keep up, and the off-market shouting price had risen in a straight line, with a large gap. Therefore, transactions could not be carried out. The off-market trend slightly weakened yesterday. Because commercial and bank drafts were about to be recalled, credit turnover in the market gradually tightened, and the general trend of money market was generally viewed as tight, so financial goods fell first yesterday, and other prices also showed weakness. Other small popular stocks were quoted at one to one and a half times the closing price in dark market, and unpopular stocks were rarely quoted.

### Yarn and Cloth Both Weak

Yesterday, cotton yarn weakened due to tight money market, weak sentiment, low gold prices outside of the exchange, and a decline in all goods. At noon, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn retreated to 9.5 million yuan, down 19 million yuan from yesterday. 40-count and 32-count yarns were down by 10 million to 20 million yuan respectively. 21-count Double Horse stack notes were down 16 million yuan, and spot goods were down 14.5 million yuan. All yarns below 20 counts weakened.

The shouting price of cotton cloth outside of the exchange fluctuated. Leading fine cloth and Four Gentlemen serge still hovered around the four-yuan mark. The shouting price was initially firm, but it softened slightly later, and ultimately fell slightly with the prices of goods outside of the exchange. Spinning and Weaving continued to sell cotton cloth as usual, including trumpet fine cloth, deputy brand serge gray cloth, second-grade gray cloth, jumping carp bleached cloth, Taoyuan floral cloth and 15 other varieties. Due to transportation obstacles and the lack of new orders, street sales were sluggish, resulting in a very depressed sentiment.

### The Hualian Ship Had a False Alarm; The Smoke Was Extinguished Immediately; Passengers Fled; Order Disrupted; The Huasheng Ship Also Caught Fire

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Hualian ship of the China United Company, which was rented by a certain bank this time to transport employees to Keelung, was scheduled to depart this morning. Yesterday, it was docked at Pier No. 2 of the Taikoo Company on the Bund, Zhongshan East 2nd Road. Passengers and luggage were boarding the ship, but at approximately 3:30 PM, smoke suddenly billowed from the chimney of the ship. Passengers caught sight of the smoke, mistook it for a fire, and fled immediately, causing chaos. The captain reported the situation and immediately raised the flag to request help. The Taikoo Company telegraphed the 16th Precinct Fire Brigade to report the fire, and they rushed to the pier in fire trucks to put out the fire. Upon learning of the incident, the Jianghai Customs Fire Brigade also dispatched the Pujie fireboat to the scene. By the time they arrived at the Hualian ship, the fire had already been extinguished. The fire trucks and boats returned to their stations, and the false alarm was over. Passengers and luggage continued to board the ship, and it was reported that the ship was undamaged and permitted to depart for Taiwan this morning.

Furthermore, the Huasheng ship of the Huasheng Shipping Company on Sichuan Road, which has a displacement of over 9,000 tons, had its hold fully loaded with luggage, furniture, paint, and other items, and its second deck loaded with personnel, and was docked at Zhanghuabang, preparing to sail to Taiwan. Unexpectedly, on the evening of May 2nd, at 7:00 PM, a fire suddenly broke out and burned fiercely. Upon receiving the report, Deng Quansheng, the Harbor Master of Jianghai Customs, immediately ordered the Pujie fireboat to rush from the Customs Wharf at the highest speed to put out the fire. An hour later, the fire was under control, and firefighters wearing smoke masks risked entering the hold to direct their efforts at extinguishing what was still burning until at 11:25 PM when the fire was completely extinguished, fortunately averting a major disaster.

### Mayor Chen Discusses General Municipal Facilities: Coal Shortage Expected to Be Resolved, Solutions for Fish and Vegetables Available, Only Rice Monitoring and Two Sources Need to Be Unimpeded, Citizens' Livelihood and Survival Can Be Worry-Free

[Our Newspaper News] Today is the second day of the inauguration of the new Shanghai Mayor Chen Liang. Our reporter made a special visit to Mr. Chen and inquired about general municipal facilities. He kindly made the following remarks:

Currently, the most emotionally stirring issue is personnel matters. Prices for public utilities can be adjusted very high, while the salaries of public school teachers and staff are very low, leading to a significant social contradiction. The resulting instability in personnel is most regrettable. Regarding the overall personnel of the municipal government, adjustments are planned to begin immediately and can be decided in a short period. After a decision is made, all administrative matters can be renewed, and we can move forward together.

As for the current situation in Shanghai, due to the strict military deployment and prolonged defense, there is virtually no question that Shanghai will exist forever. The most urgent issue to be resolved now is the coal shortage. Negotiations have been conducted with the Taiwan Provincial Government to exchange flour, gauze, and daily necessities for Taiwanese coal. Chairman Chen has agreed to allocate 40,000 tons per month and has designated Director Situ of the Taiwan Materials Adjustment Committee to be responsible for handling it. However, the city's monthly coal consumption must reach 100,000 tons. An additional 30,000 tons have been requested from the Taiwan Provincial Government. It has now been decided that the Coal Adjustment Association, Central Trust Bureau, and the Four Mines Joint Management Office will be limited to exchanging 100,000 bolts of cloth, each bolt for one ton of coal, totaling 100,000 tons, within two weeks. Additionally, the Central Bank has been requested to urgently purchase and store 50,000 tons. This will completely alleviate the coal shortage in the future.

Plan to Grow Vegetables on Garden Roofs

With the fuel problem resolved, all production and water and electricity supply will naturally be sufficient. In terms of food, if meat is lacking, fish can be substituted. The city is close to rivers and seas, with abundant fish resources, and fish is more nutritious than meat. Regarding vegetables, in case river transport is blocked, private gardens and open spaces in the city can be opened up for vegetable cultivation. Even private rooftops can be utilized. Agricultural experts have been asked to draft a plan, which will be enforced once it is finalized.

In summary, as long as the two sources of rice monitoring are unblocked in Shanghai today, all livelihood problems can be self-sufficiently and completely resolved. The lives and survival of citizens will be worry-free. Coupled with military coordination, Shanghai will be an impregnable fortress.

### Chen Baotai Appointed Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wang Weiheng Succeeds as Director of the Finance Bureau, Qian Jianfu Transferred to Deputy General Manager of the City Bank

[Our Newspaper News] Mayor Chen Liang also told reporters: Zhao Banfu, Acting Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, has been approved to resign. The vacant position has been officially reassigned to Chen Baotai. Furthermore, Qian Jianfu, Deputy Director and Acting Director of the city's Finance Bureau, although only acting for a month, has put great effort into reorganizing tax revenue and raising funds, especially in the timely payment of public school teachers and staff salaries. However, due to current difficulties, he has repeatedly requested to resign from his acting position. It has been reported that Mayor Chen has approved it. However, Mr. Chen still highly values Acting Director Qian and has transferred him to Deputy General Manager of the City Bank so that he can continue to assist the city's finances. The new Director of the Finance Bureau has also been announced as Wang Weiheng. Mr. Wang previously served as Deputy Director of the Quartermaster General Headquarters for a long time. He recently transferred to Shanghai from Taiwan and served as Deputy Commander of the Second Supply District. Having been in charge of military supplies for a long time, he is known as an expert in financial management. In the future, the city's finances will surely enter a new phase.

### Personnel Changes in Various Police Precincts

[Our Newspaper News] The Municipal Police Department announced the following personnel changes for precinct chiefs yesterday: (1) Huang Zhen, Chief of Yulin Road Precinct, has been rehired as an instructor at the Police Academy. His vacant position will be filled by Lu Yimin, Captain of the Department's General Team. (2) Chen Zhengming, Chief of Xujiahui Precinct, has been approved to resign. His vacant position will be filled by Song Gong, Chief Inspector. (3) Shao Yuanbin, Chief of Facao Precinct, has been transferred to the Bureau. His vacant position will be filled by Secretary Chen Tiansan, and Yang Guorui, Head of the Resident Police Training Group, will be additionally appointed as Deputy Chief of the Precinct.

### Zhao Xianglin Agrees to Serve as Director of the Education Bureau

[Our Office News] Since Li Ximou resigned from the position of Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Mayor Chen intended to invite Fudan University Professor Zhao Xianglin to succeed him. Yesterday morning, Mayor Chen personally visited Yucai Middle School to urge Zhao to take the position of Director of the Education Bureau. Zhao is originally from Wenzhou, Zhejiang. He studied at Columbia University in the United States and obtained a master's degree in education. During the Anti-Japanese War, he served as a Senior Supervisor in the Ministry of Education. He is currently a professor in the Education Department of Fudan University. Mr. Zhao has now agreed to the position of Director of the Education Bureau, and his official appointment can be announced in the coming days.

### Mao Yisheng Succeeds as Secretary-General of the Municipal Government

[Our Newspaper News] After Chen Liang was appointed Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government, it is now learned that Mao Yisheng has been decided to succeed him as Secretary-General, a position left vacant.

### Public Utility Index Soars for Days, Citizens Unable to Bear the Burden, Mayor Orders Reduction, Today is 890,000 Times

[East China News Agency] Due to the sharp rise in the public utility valuation index in the city's public utility and transportation sectors in recent days, the calculated selling prices have soared accordingly, greatly threatening the livelihood of citizens. Public school teachers and staff and salaried classes in general are unable to bear the burden. The mayor received reports of blame from all parties and was very concerned. He ordered the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau to advise various public utility companies to consider the burden on citizens and try to maintain the status quo as much as possible. It is heard that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, after receiving instructions from Mayor Chen yesterday, has decided to reduce the public utility valuation index as much as possible in the future. The public utility valuation index calculated by the various public utility companies reached 1.25 million times, which was reduced by Mayor Chen to 890,000 times.

### Glimpses of the Hong Kong Gold Rush

— Special Correspondent Leng Zheqi

[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong, 22nd Flight News] Regarding the "Gold Rush" in Hong Kong, after many speculations during the Easter holiday, things became clear after the holiday on the 18th of this month. The following points are noted:

(1) The Hong Kong government has not yet purchased gold. According to its spokesperson, "If the government wants to buy gold, it can buy it from South Africa, which is even cheaper."

(2) Bank private safe deposit boxes have not been searched, but individuals storing gold should register with the government.

(3) The Hong Kong government limits the purchase of jewelry by the public to no more than three taels. Purchasers must leave their address. 95 gold or 22K gold can circulate freely.

(4) Rumors of the devaluation of the British pound are still rife in the market. The black market exchange rate for the US dollar has risen from HK$5.30 to around HK$5.80 per dollar.

(5) The Portuguese currency in Macau has also risen. One Hong Kong dollar is only worth about 7.5 Portuguese patacas, compared to about 8 patacas in the past.

(6) Each Yuan Shikai silver dollar is worth about HK$5.80, compared to about HK$4 in the past.

(7) Hong Kong and Chinese jewelry today costs around HK$380 per tael to sell and HK$340 to buy. In the past (before the gold rush), it was only worth around HK$320.

(8) The entire city is shifting its position to Macau.

(9) Not only is the financial market rising, but the commodity market is also fluctuating. Raw peanuts, with up to 20,000 pieces per day, were only about 63.4 yuan in the early morning of the 18th, but then gradually closed higher and stopped selling cheaply. Various types of beans, taking advantage of scarcity, have been rising in price. The flour market, which was originally the most sluggish, also followed suit yesterday. Sarsky flour in Hong Kong costs 14 yuan, and those with export permits have risen from 17.2 yuan to 17.4 yuan. The Western medicine market is also in full swing, with lung injections, penicillin injections, dantu lien, and star do mycin, among others, all rising in price. Gauze has risen the most sharply. Various colored white cloths have risen by 1.2 yuan per bolt. 20-count yarn has risen by 20 to 30 yuan per bag, and 42-count yarn has risen by 6.70 yuan.

### The Pearl of the Orient: Food and Housing in Hong Kong

[Hong Kong, 26th - Airmail] Everyone has heard the saying: "Live in Hangzhou, die in Liuzhou, eat in Guangzhou!" Nobody has ever said "Eat in Hong Kong," even though Hong Kong is geographically only separated from Guangzhou by a strip of water.

Because of this, it's a little difficult for me to talk about food and drink in Hong Kong; but wait, as the saying goes: "Good things can be praised, and bad things can be criticized!" So, even if I risk being accused of writing a rambling article, I can still talk about it for a while.

As I said above, Hong Kong is not a place known for its food and drink. In other words, Hongkongers simply don't have a "eat only the finest, slice only the thinnest" kind of demand. Therefore, besides the government-priced rice which is frequently in short supply, the government-priced bread at four dimes a pound and the government-priced biscuits at one dollar a pound, have become the "specialty foods" here!

Hearing this, perhaps some genuine Hongkongers will think that my words are close to being harsh and insulting to their dignity. They will certainly protest: "You can't say that, don't you see the tea houses, restaurants, eateries… as numerous as one building every five steps, a pavilion every ten steps? And haven't you seen those banquets that cost three or five hundred dollars a table, ordered in large quantities by diners every day?" But, to such questions, I can immediately offer a rebuttal: is that what you call understanding food? Does all this prove that Hongkongers value "eating" very much? No! The reason why Hongkongers go to big restaurants, why they order a table of dishes costing three or five hundred dollars, is often just to save "face" and eat for the "grand scene." Where would you find a "fool" who doesn't mind spending large amounts of money to seek out delicious food? As for those who go to tea houses several times a day for the sake of "socializing," you would be wrong to say they are gluttonous!

However, here, true gourmets and "discerning" diners are not entirely absent. In ordinary times, we see many people "risking" going to places like Shau Kei Wan to eat their "Sam Luk" (a local delicacy); in Wan Chai, Dunqiu Square, Jiao Gong Street, under the banyan tree… we also occasionally see some smartly dressed people, picking their teeth, squatting in front of the beef offal stalls, savoring the sea snails! However, these are really just the minority.

Here, the majority of people ultimately take pride in eating Western food. As a result, influenced by this trend, coffee and black tea have taken the place of "Pu'er" and "Longjing"; and they have replaced sausage rolls and char siu buns. What's even more interesting is that some people, when they come here, even stop preserving the "national essence" of having "one pot and two pieces" every morning, and compete to drink coffee instead!

Everyone knows that Cantonese people can eat anything! Be it snake, rat, or insect, they "wipe it out" all the same! Hongkongers naturally retain this habit, so the hawkers selling "beef offal" are as numerous as police officers standing guard at their posts. You can find one or two such food stalls almost every street and alley you walk through. Its fragrant aroma, plus the colored livers, are very tempting. Almost eight out of ten ordinary citizens here are fond of these things. They call this snack and herbal tea "Coca-Cola" at the same time. I remember a poet from another place who came here for the first time, and when he walked down the street, he caught sight of these "beef offal" and was so frightened that he widened his eyes and asked someone: "Is this for eating? Are they human organs?" Speaking of human meat, it would be forced and strange if it were also sold here. But, if there really is such a gourmet who wants to taste the weird taste of human meat, then I can also introduce you: please take out five dollars and walk around Sontonqiu Square. If you live in Kowloon, you might as well move to Rongshu Head. This way, you can get a taste of it! (Forgive me for digressing a bit, but I have to explain: this is also a kind of "eating in Hong Kong"!)

Anyone who has lived in Hong Kong for some time knows that there is a cross street in Wan Chai commonly known as "Glutton Street". Since it is called "Glutton," wouldn't my statement above that Hong Kong is not particular about food and drink be unbelievable? But, I have to tell you that the connotation of the two words "Glutton" is originally just: eat a meal regardless of whether it is good or bad!

Why are Hongkongers less particular about food and drink than people in Guangzhou?

The reason is very simple: because Hong Kong is a place where it is not easy to find food!

Below, let's talk about the situation of living here.

"The Pearl of the Orient," this is an honorary title belonging to Hong Kong. Yes, there are neat streets, lush mountain scenery, plus a climate that is like spring all year round. So, in the eyes of some people, isn't it a "pearl" in the "palm"?

Then, some people who have not been here may think this way: it must be very comfortable? But, the truth is not so! Just think, this place is only a little over twenty miles in circumference, but it is crammed with nearly 1.8 million people - listen clearly, 1.8 million! How can life be comfortable!

Naturally, these are all about the situation of ordinary citizens. There is a saying here that goes: "If you have money, live upstairs, if you don't, live on the ground and be a rascal." So, besides the more "rascals" living on the ground, there are also people who live comfortably "upstairs."

The buildings in Hong Kong have a feature that is different from other places, that is: general residential buildings are mostly built in the same style. Saying that the houses here are "pigeon coops!" I really admire the cleverness of the person who created this adjective. Please close your eyes and think: when you are crossing the sea here by ferry, aren't rows of "pigeon coops" clearly displayed in front of you? Look, how vivid the two words "pigeon coop" are!

If someone asks: how many people can live in such a "pigeon coop"? Then, let's calculate now. If this building has four floors, each floor has four rooms, and two beds (in fact, many beds are divided into upper and lower bunks, a total of four or six!), an average of six people, big and small, live in a room, and an average of two people sleep in a bed. In this way, a "pigeon coop" can accommodate 112 people! (Please don't underestimate this number. In the army, with this number, it is enough to form a complete "company." Moreover, in many small villages in the mainland, there are not so many people in a village!)

Looking at this situation, saying that the house is a "pigeon coop" is just to describe its appearance. As for its contents, if I were to find a concrete thing to compare it to, I think only a "sardine can" is qualified.

So many people are squeezed into a house. Logically speaking, it should be very lively, right? However, I don't know why the people here seem to have all contracted a kind of "don't want to associate with each other" attitude. Although everyone lives in the same building, the people on the second floor often don't know the surname of the people on the third floor, and the people in the first room don't know what kind of occupation the people in the last room have. They meet each other several times a day, but they never nod. If someone calls out "Good morning!" to the other party, it may immediately lead to a suspicious look and an awkward face. There is a popular ballad here: "The first room laughs, the last room cries, the second floor invites guests to a wedding banquet, the third floor buys a coffin, monsters and gods live in the same house, all kinds of people share the same roof!" These few words truly describe the scene of living together here and the characteristics of "living" in Hong Kong!

It's really not a place to live everywhere here, but it doesn't matter. Hongkongers never worry about the problem of "living," because the life philosophy of Hongkongers is: "It doesn't matter if the home is dirty and cramped, you must be well-dressed when going out." What does it matter if the residence is a little cramped and dirty? Just don't tell your address to strangers!

There is another big feature of "living" here, so let's talk about it here. The second landlords here are especially famous. Everyone knows the name "landlady"! In some novels, plays, or newspaper cartoons, we often see their appearance and figure, so there is really no need for me to introduce them again. But, some people may ask: why have we never heard of the name "landlord"? Are all landlords widows or spinsters? Answer: no. The reason is that the second landlords here mostly adopt the "presidential vacancy system," so the power falls into the "responsible cabinet" of the Prime Minister, and it is not accidental that it deserves its name!

"Keep for food, not for lodging"! "Every inch of land is worth an ounce of gold"! These are words that can often be heard here. The ancients said: "It is not easy to live in Chang'an". Judging from this, it is "not easy to live" everywhere here!

### Tragedy of Anti-Chinese Sentiment in Malaya: Interview with Distressed Overseas Chinese Repatriated to Shantou

— Ruirui

[Shantou, this newspaper, 1st – Airmail] Two batches of distressed overseas Chinese who were repatriated from Malaya have been transferred by boat and arrived in Shantou. They were all concentrated and sent from Singapore. After being imprisoned for more than half a year, this large group of distressed overseas Chinese finally gained freedom and were deported. Their tragic experiences and the vicious means used in the anti-Chinese tragedy staged in Malaya are chilling. When this reporter inspected the "Distressed Overseas Chinese Reception Center" and conducted interviews, they all talked endlessly about the beginning and end of this tragic and desolate incident.

The anti-Chinese movement in Malaya has been deteriorating since last year. By June, the British government in Malaya promulgated the "Emergency Ordinance". Every member of the political department or secret agent was granted great power. They could arbitrarily arrest people they considered "guilty" or should arrest, without any actual evidence. The anti-Chinese action reached a fever pitch as a result. These secret agents and special agents who were charged with missions ran rampant everywhere, extorting money by taking advantage of their power, taking revenge on personal grudges, and making arrests indiscriminately to gain merit. The situation in Malaya fell into an unprecedented tragedy.

Although the Malayan government said that the "Emergency Ordinance" was aimed at dealing with "thugs" and stabilizing the local area, it was actually an excuse to deal with overseas Chinese. As a further action to suppress the Chinese, more than 10,000 men, women, old and young have been arrested and detained under the "Emergency Ordinance" in various parts of Malaya for more than half a year. This large group is not thugs, but peace-abiding and good overseas Chinese. In the beginning, fewer people were arrested. A month later, this emergency action spread. The local special agents were unable to suppress the increasingly turbulent situation, but they vented their anger on our innocent compatriots. They even detained all the overseas Chinese men, women, old and young in many cities and villages, regardless of their good or bad behavior, under the pretext of "failure to report information." During this period, some were beaten and raped. After the overseas Chinese were driven out, the houses and property they lived in were burned down. The fire covered the sky. Not only were the hard-earned money of the overseas Chinese for decades reduced to ashes, but some were separated from their wives and children, and their families were destroyed. Among those arrested, the elderly could not move and the young could not speak. Were they also suspected of "riots"?

Under the "emergency" action in Malaya, all the sacrifices were overseas Chinese. The burning atrocities destroyed all the assets of the overseas Chinese. Among them, the areas with the heaviest losses were the vicinity of Beizhou and Fengliandong Road. Nearly 1,000 houses were burned down, and more than 2,000 distressed overseas Chinese were arrested and transferred to Bandi Port. The rest fled in all directions. In Selangor's Kajangjiaojiao Port, more than 60 shops throughout the town were burned down, and more than 1,000 distressed overseas Chinese were arrested. In Shenxiang Island and Quangouwei, Senzhou, more than 1,500 distressed overseas Chinese were arrested. In the areas of Duanluo and Dua Leng in Beizhou, more than 400 houses were burned down, and nearly 1,000 distressed overseas Chinese were arrested. In Maoxian and Yalatop, Jilan Prefecture, more than 200 houses were burned down, dozens of people were injured by bombs, and more than 200 people were arrested. In Selangor's Xingu Mao Rubber Garden, 24 workers were collectively surrounded and massacred. All the shops in Xinlong Town, Perlis State, were burned down. The overseas Chinese in other villages, rubber gardens, factories, and mines in Jinma were brutally abused or unreasonably arrested, often in the thousands. The losses of the overseas Chinese are estimated to be no less than several hundred million dollars. Recently, more than 40 wealthy households have been arrested in the states of Malacca and Johor. Among them, those with assets of up to several million dollars have been accused of sponsoring "thugs" and their property confiscated. All overseas Chinese who have not been harmed by the "Emergency Ordinance" do not have their lives and property guaranteed.

No matter what the excuse is to deal with local thugs, the first to suffer harm are overseas Chinese. After the British government in Malaya burned down, looted, and cleaned out the houses, shops, and property of the overseas Chinese, they detained this large group of arrested

Overseas Chinese were detained and sent to concentration camps on isolated islands. Relatives were not allowed to visit, and all contact with the outside world was cut off, suffering from hunger and humiliation. Some distressed overseas Chinese committed suicide by cutting their abdomens because they could not bear the humiliation of being detained for no reason. Some women also staged a tragic suicide by hanging to show their protest.

As a result of constant "cleansing" and arrests everywhere for more than half a year, all concentration camps are overcrowded. The Malayan government is faced with the problem of how to deal with this group of "suspects". It is impossible to convict the overseas Chinese, and there is no good way to release them. This large group of distressed overseas Chinese had their houses and property burned down, and they had no home to return to and no job to take. Once released, they have no place to go. As a result, they have no choice but to send all the distressed overseas Chinese back to their home country. This is the true face of the Malayan government's anti-Chinese sentiment. When they need them, they welcome the Chinese and recruit them. When they don't need them, they deport them and drive them away.

The overseas Chinese, both men and women, old and young, numbering more than 700, who were brought back by Jie Feng and Jie Sheng, generation after generation

were repatriated under these circumstances. Most of them are from the Chaozhou and Meizhou regions, and some are from Guangzhou and Xiamen. Their hard-earned assets, which they had worked so hard for over decades, were reduced to ashes in this disaster. What is left now is a shooter's hand and tattered clothes. Some have been away from their hometown for decades, and their feelings for their hometown have been severed. Some are overseas Chinese students born in foreign countries. Where is home and where to go? If this problem is not properly resolved, they will face the tragic fate of becoming refugees again.

The distressed overseas Chinese who have been repatriated are the first and second batches, accounting for less than one-tenth of the total. There are still tens of thousands of people in "concentration camps" preparing to be "expelled" back. Shantou, this disaster-ridden place, has become a transit port for distressed overseas Chinese to land and be repatriated.

### The Overseas Chinese and Indonesia: A Blood Debt is Written

— Manping

The overseas Chinese, who were once hailed as the "Mother of the Revolution," had more or less a taste of "It's our turn to hold our heads high today" on the eve of the end of World War II. However, the cruel reality relentlessly shattered this dream that had been awaited for over thirty years.

If we are not very forgetful, we should remember that during the period when you were running around for the revolution, the overseas Chinese made considerable contributions, both spiritually and materially, to the birth of this child of the millions - the Republic of China. The formation of this patriotic enthusiasm is often not easily understood and is compared to the Japanese-style "mystical patriotism." Some even ridicule it as "Nanyang Bo." In fact, the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese due to their circumstances will never be so simple. Their residence in foreign countries, the exploitation they personally feel, and the various unreasonable stimuli produce this inevitable result - patriotic enthusiasm. It is definitely not something that compatriots in the country can universally understand and feel the same way. This patriotic enthusiasm encourages them to contribute manpower and material resources as much as possible within the possible scope.

"I heard that many people wearing bamboo hats and straw sandals have arrived in a certain port" (Note: This is a term used by overseas Chinese to refer to the National Army). The person who said this looked quite invincible. Not to mention that his own compatriots felt excited about this sentence, even the local natives could not help but have a premonition that "the Hua Bo cannot be offended today." However, all this could not withstand the blow of the ruthless facts. The first thing that made them unable to get by was the second surrender of the Japanese invaders, and the national flag that was raised in the early morning was forcibly lowered immediately for the reason of avoiding misunderstanding. Then came the exploratory test of the Bov-ndoeng fire in March 1946. From this fire test, they achieved considerable success, that is, they learned that our government was not very interested in the safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese.

Following the Bov-ndoeng fire, the extremists of the Indonesian revolutionaries, in order to destroy the economic foundation of the overseas Chinese in Java, held an unprecedented massacre in Bonten, using all kinds of methods such as skinning, dismembering, and raping. This tragic and inhuman atrocity has since written a page of indelible blood debt between the two ethnic groups. The Dutch government seized this contradiction and launched the so-called Overseas Chinese Self-Defense Force. Generally, after surviving the ordeal, the compatriots picked up the guns issued by the Dutch government and did indeed make considerable retaliation against the local natives for their family feuds and personal grievances. As a result, these two major ethnic groups blindly deepened this difficult-to-explain hatred under the clever manipulation of Dutch imperialism. As a result, more cruel and thorough burning and killing continued to be staged in various parts of Central and Eastern Java under the control of the natives. Until now, Sumatra is still carrying out that inhumane massacre, and the economic foundation that the overseas Chinese have worked hard to manage for hundreds of years has been destroyed quite thoroughly. What is the use of another set of official-style protests and visits?

Ah! Orphans who have lost the love of their parents! The bloody facts will not be forgotten!
