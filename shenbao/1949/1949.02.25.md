[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th] The full text of the "Financial and Monetary Reform Plan" passed by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 23rd is as follows:

(A) Regarding Finance: (1) Accurately estimate all necessary military expenses and materials for this year to comprehensively calculate and make realistic and reliable plans for preparation, and pay special attention to the following items: 1. Salary amounts calculated in silver dollars; 2. Allowance amounts calculated in silver dollars; 3. The quantity of rice and flour needed for military provisions; 4. The quantity of cotton cloth needed for military uniforms; 5. The amount of foreign equipment and foreign exchange needed for ordnance fuel, telecommunications engineering, etc. (2) Promptly determine the policy direction for this year, compile a budget, so that all political facilities have a basis, and all financial expenditures have a scope. (3) Revise the financial revenue and expenditure system. The 30% of land tax currently retained by the central government will be returned to local governments starting from the 38th grain year. The local tobacco and alcohol taxes, and special business taxes originally belonging to the central government will be assigned to local governments. While not hindering the principle of central taxation, restrictions on local tax levies will be relaxed, so that the finances of most provinces, cities, and counties can be self-sufficient and no longer rely on subsidies from the national treasury. (4) The collection of food grains through forced levies has been implemented for many years, and the people's burden has become heavy. It should be stopped starting from the 38th grain year (the grain year is from October 1st to September 30th of the following year), and the principal and interest of borrowed items that should be returned will be extended for two years. (5) Customs import duties will be calculated and paid in Customs Gold Units, following the former Customs Gold Unit system, with each Customs Gold Unit equal to 40 US cents. People can purchase Customs Gold Units from the Central Bank with gold, silver, foreign currency, or foreign exchange transfer certificates solely for the purpose of paying customs duties and will not be circulated in the market. (6) For goods subject to commodity tax, such as cotton yarn, matches, cement, cigarettes, and sugar, which are produced centrally and taxed at the factory, physical goods will be collected according to the prescribed rates. For those that are inconvenient to collect in physical goods, the amount will be calculated based on the prescribed tax rates and converted into gold yuan based on the wholesale price of the same goods in the local area on the day of tax payment. (7) The collection of salt tax shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of the preceding article on commodity tax. When necessary, the government may operate a portion of official collection and transportation to maintain a balance between production and sales. (8) In the direct tax of business income tax, as far as possible, adopt the method of sharing and contracting payments by the same industry, estimate the tax amount based on the business conditions of each industry in various regions, and entrust the respective trade associations to urge and collect the payments within a time limit to simplify the process.

(B) Regarding Finance and Currency System: (1) People are allowed to buy and sell gold and silver, and the Central Bank may also buy and sell gold and silver to stabilize market prices. (2) Silver dollars are allowed to circulate and be traded. The government plans to purchase silver and mint silver dollars. (3) Foreign currency is still prohibited from circulation. The Central Bank's exchange of foreign currency should be calculated with reference to the market price of gold and the price of foreign exchange transfer certificates. (4) Gold, silver, silver dollars, and foreign currency may not be transported or carried out of the country without special permission from the Ministry of Finance, except for the Central Bank. This restriction does not apply to travelers carrying gold jewelry totaling no more than two market ounces, silver jewelry totaling no more than twenty market ounces, or foreign currency totaling no more than US$500. (5) Those transporting gold, silver, silver dollars, and foreign currency into the country, except for the Central Bank, gold and silver should be subject to import duties, and the overall rate will be determined separately. Travelers carrying gold jewelry totaling no more than two market ounces, silver jewelry totaling no more than twenty market ounces, or foreign currency totaling no more than US$500 are exempt from taxation.

### Export Foreign Exchange and Overseas Remittances: All to be Exchanged for Foreign Exchange Transfer Certificates

(C) Regarding Import and Export Trade: (1) All foreign exchange earned from exporting goods and remittances from overseas Chinese should be handed over to the Central Bank or its designated bank in exchange for foreign exchange transfer certificates of equal value, to be used by oneself or transferred to others for importing goods from abroad or paying for approved non-import foreign exchange needs. (2) The Central Bank should maintain a reasonable market price for foreign exchange transfer certificates to encourage exports and overseas remittances. (3) The import of tobacco, petroleum, and petroleum products will continue to maintain the quota allocation method. The import of food, cotton, and fertilizers will be handled according to the government's separate regulations. For other goods allowed to be imported, merchants can report for import within the prescribed time limit after obtaining foreign exchange transfer certificates. The types of goods prohibited from import and temporarily suspended from import will be determined and announced by the government at any time. (4) For goods imported from abroad with self-provided foreign exchange that fall into the categories allowed to be imported under the preceding article, they can be directly reported to the customs for import. Those belonging to quota allocation and government-coordinated handling must first be approved by the import and export management agency.

### Exercising Silver Dollars Does Not Mean Implementing a New Monetary System; Gold Yuan Notes Cease Issuance; Borrowing Silver from the United States Has Achieved Considerable Success

Xu Kan Answers Reporters' Questions

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 24th] Minister Xu Kan answered reporters' questions at a press conference today as follows: (1) If the government can maintain the integrity of the area south of the Yangtze River, the annual customs revenue can still reach US$30 million, and the value of exports can also exceed US$200 million, which can have the greatest impact on financial support. (2) Collecting commodity taxes in kind will not affect the circulation of gold yuan notes. The collected physical goods will still be used entirely to regulate the market. (3) Exercising silver dollars does not mean implementing a new monetary system, but in addition to exercising existing silver dollars, a large number of new silver dollars of the same weight and fineness will be minted to stabilize the credit of gold yuan notes. (4) Xu confirmed the news of borrowing silver from the United States, saying that considerable success has been achieved. (5) There is no fixed ratio between gold, silver, silver dollars, and gold yuan notes. It is determined by the market itself, and the Central Bank does not intend to list prices. (6) After the implementation of the new plan, the issuance of gold yuan notes will cease immediately. (7) Financial control agencies will be abolished soon. (8) The government will launch gold and foreign currency deposits. (9) A separate law on the revenue and expenditure system for local taxes will be formulated to prevent abuses. (10) Efforts will be made to restore the pre-war treatment of public education and religious personnel.

### Yu Youren Hosts Banquet Today for Military and Political Leaders Arriving in Nanjing

### Li Shucheng Reports on Impressions of Visiting Communist Areas

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 24th] Li Shucheng, a respected elder of Hubei Province, reported to people from the Hubei Provincial Peace Promotion Association on the afternoon of the 24th on his impressions of visiting the Communist areas, stating that the prospects for peace are very promising. The Communists have no room for compromise on the issue of war criminals. In view of the heavy sacrifices made by the people in the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign, they do have a sincere desire for peace. However, it is feared that it will not be easy to compromise on the reorganization of the army. They are somewhat suspicious of the government's pursuit of peace and the peace movement in Shanghai and Hankou. General observations suggest that the Communist Party's attitude also adopts the principle of "preparing for war while seeking peace." We can only continue to appeal from the people's standpoint to dispel suspicion, communicate emotions, and achieve genuine peace, and must not be biased, increasing unnecessary disputes. Speaking of the situation in the Communist areas, Li said: The Communist Party has three slogans: (1) The chief culprits will not be taught. (2) Those who are coerced will not be investigated. (3) Those who have meritorious service will be rewarded. Currently, all schools and employees of industrial and commercial groups in the Communist areas spend two hours a day studying the eight conditions and the issue of crossing the river. Li also said that the reason why the Communist army is not crossing the river now may be that they need rest and replenishment. It is heard that some of the Communist army are still at home for the New Year.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 24th] Vice President of the Executive Yuan Wu Tiecheng arrived in Nanjing by special plane from Guangzhou at 2:20 PM on the 24th.

Those who came with him included Minister of the Interior Hong Lanyou, Vice Minister of the Interior Zhang Shouxian, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ye Gongchao, Legislative Members Chen Bosheng, Jiang Yiping, Zheng Zhenyu, Liu Xiaoyi, and the Chairman of the Guangdong and Hong Kong General Branch of the Kuomintang Li Dachao, and more than ten others. The plane took off from Guangzhou at 10:15 AM and briefly stopped at Nanchang Airport due to the weather in Nanjing. Yu Youren, Tong Guanxian, Chen Kewen, Ni Jiongheng, Huang Bodu, and others who had heard the news went to the airport to welcome them. After the special plane landed, Wu first got off the plane and shook hands and exchanged greetings with the welcomers. Then, at the request of the reporters present, he met with reporters from various newspapers in the airport lounge and answered questions. Wu first emphasized that the opinions between Nanjing and Guangzhou were completely consistent. When reporters asked if there was hope for peace, Wu replied in an optimistic tone: Of course there is hope, as long as everyone works hard. When reporters asked what symbols he hoped for, Wu said: Because the people want peace, everyone wants peace, peace will definitely be achieved. When reporters asked if there was any new contact regarding US aid, Wu smiled and said: The 1948 Economic Aid to China Program should expire in March of this year, and the 1949 Foreign Aid Act should begin in July. During the transition period from April to June of this year, we have exchanged opinions with Lai Parke on the economic assistance plan.

Wu also told reporters in a solemn tone: The rumors that Acting President Li and President Sun have not fully agreed on certain issues are not true. Acting President Li exchanged opinions with President Sun several times during this southern tour, and there was no disagreement. In the future, the Executive Yuan meetings will still be held in Guangzhou. If the minister is not present, the vice minister can represent him. All important political officials will travel back and forth between Nanjing and Guangzhou. There is no contradiction with Acting President Li's idea that the center of affairs is in Guangzhou and the center of politics is in Nanjing. Wu also said that President Sun and other important leaders of the Executive Yuan will travel to and from Nanjing and Guangzhou in the future to assist Acting President Li in presiding over the great plan for peace. President Sun has already reassured Minister of Transportation Yu Dawei and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zuo Shunsheng, who have submitted their resignations.

### The Chinese Communists Have Established the Pingjin Railway Administration in Beiping

Branch Bureaus Set Up in Tianjin and Shijiazhuang

[Our Newspaper] According to a broadcast by the Shaanbei Chinese Communist Radio, the Chinese Communists have established a unified organization for railway transportation in North China, called the "Pingjin Railway Administration," which was established in Beiping on the 22nd. This is a new facility of the Ministry of Transportation after the Chinese Communist "People's Government" of Shijiazhuang moved to Beiping.

### Three Airline Companies Transport Grain and Airdrop Supplies to Taiyuan

Flying Round-Trip Twice from Shanghai

[Our Newspaper] Taiyuan is in dire need of food. Recently, Yan Xishan came south mainly to discuss sources of food supply and assistance. It is reported that three airline companies, China, Central, and Civil Aviation Corps, have been entrusted by the government to transport food from Shanghai to Taiyuan for airdrop assistance. China and the Civil Aviation Corps have each sent 10 aircraft to participate, and China has more than 10 aircraft. These special grain transport planes take off before dawn every day. Because Shanghai is far away, they can only make two round trips at most each day. On average, each plane can transport more than three tons of grain each day. The three companies' planes can transport more than 100 tons per day in total. The airline companies also transported grain to Taiyuan for assistance once a month ago, using Qingdao as a base. However, it was suspended due to the shortage of gasoline in Qingdao. This time, it takes off from Shanghai, but the distance is longer, and the transportation rate is greatly affected. It is reported that the airline companies are trying to solve the gasoline supply in Qingdao so that Qingdao can still be used as the departure point.

### No Signs of Panic in Qingdao; Ample Reserves of Grain, Coal, and Cotton; Head of the Food Group of the Economic Cooperation Administration Talks About His Return to Shanghai from Qingdao

[Our Newspaper] "Recent news about the chaos and panic in Qingdao is all baseless." This is what Han Tuo, the head of the food group of the Economic Cooperation Administration, who returned to Shanghai from Qingdao the night before last, said. Han stayed in Qingdao for a week and felt that Qingdao's environment was peaceful and beautiful. He specially took his newlywed wife to the area for a week-long honeymoon trip. According to reports, Qingdao currently has sufficient grain, cotton, and coal to maintain consumption for a considerable period. It is estimated that coal can last until mid-April, and cotton can supply another month's needs. In terms of flour from the Economic Cooperation Administration alone, it is enough to maintain rationed food for the entire city (20 catties per person) until June. He also confirmed that Gong Xuesui is still in office in Qingdao, and he even dined with Gong. However, now that the central government has announced that Qin Dechun will also serve as the mayor of Qingdao, Gong may leave Qingdao in the near future. In addition, there are still about 50,000 government troops stationed in Qingdao. These troops have strict discipline, good supplies, and sophisticated equipment such as automatic weapons, which seems to be enough to resist attacks from external forces. The general feeling in Qingdao is that the Communist army will not take action against Qingdao within a certain period. There are also no signs that the US Navy stationed in Qingdao is withdrawing. Han also denied that the flour of the Economic Cooperation Administration had been transported away from Qingdao by landing craft. However, the International Refugee Organization did transport several hundred bags of flour belonging to the organization at the same time when evacuating refugees.

Generals Fu Zuoyi and Deng Baoshan also traveled to and from the same plane as Yan and others. The Chinese Communist broadcast specified that Yan and others visited in a private capacity and did not add the title "peace representative." It also said that after Yan and others arrived in Shijiazhuang, they were immediately received by Xing Zedong and "exchanged views extensively on peace negotiations, north-south 通航通郵 and other issues." However, it did not provide specific details on the content of the peace negotiations. The radio station also said that the two generals, Fu and Deng, went to Shijiazhuang "to discuss official business with the leaders of the Chinese Communist Central Committee." Note: Yan Huiqing and his party flew from Shanghai to 于 and then to Beiping on February 13th. It has been 13 days since then. He has met with Ye Jianying, and this is the first formal discussion on peace with Mao Zedong.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The dispute over whether the Legislative Yuan should reconvene in Nanjing or Guangzhou is likely to be resolved.

Chen Bosheng and Others Return to Nanjing

Report on the Opinions of Legislators in Guangzhou

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian hosted a banquet at his official residence at 7:00 p.m. on the 24th for legislators Chen Bosheng, Jiang Yiping, Zheng Zhenyu, and Liu Xiaoyi, who arrived in Nanjing from Guangzhou that day. Jiang and Zheng were representatives of the Shanghai legislators who went to Guangzhou to exchange views with the legislators there. During the banquet, they reported the opinions of the legislators in Guangzhou to Tong. According to Mr. Zheng Zhenyu, most of the legislators in Guangzhou, with very few exceptions, had no preconceived notions about the location of the reconvening. Based on safety considerations, they advocated reconvening in Guangzhou and believed that many others would support this. However, they were not insistent on reconvening in Guangzhou. They expressed considerable dissatisfaction with the Legislative Yuan's issuance of the notice that registration for the reconvening in Nanjing would begin on the 21st without prior consultation with the legislators in Guangzhou. They felt that President Tong had stated that the location of the reconvening should respect the opinion of the majority, but without a vote, how could it be proven that those advocating reconvening in Nanjing were in the majority? However, after Mr. Zheng and other committee members explained on behalf of President Tong, they were largely understanding and believed that after the Legislative Yuan convened, they would come to Nanjing to participate.

Chen Zifeng and Six Others Host Legislators Remaining in Shanghai

[Our Dispatch] Legislators Chen Zifeng and six others, who came to Shanghai from Guangzhou to solicit opinions, held a tea party at the New Life Club at 3:00 p.m. on the 24th to welcome legislators remaining in Shanghai and exchange views on the issue of the reconvening location. Chen Zifeng first explained the purpose of the trip and emphasized the importance of unity. Lin Dong then reported, stating that the colleagues remaining in Guangzhou were not insisting that the meeting had to be held in Guangzhou, but that the initial decision to reconvene in Guangzhou was made by the legislators' talk session, and that the opinions of the colleagues should also be respected and a vote taken. Lin also stated that the report that legislators in Guangzhou could receive 300 Hong Kong dollars per month was inaccurate and believed that the person who published the news should be held legally responsible. Subsequently, Wu Yunpeng, Zhang Qianhua, Niu Jianchu, and others spoke, all advocating that the opinion of unity should be valued. Niu also suggested that they could first report to Nanjing, but that the opening time should be considered cautiously. Cheng Cangbi explained that the legislators remaining in Shanghai had met several times and wanted to seek a win-win solution. Their final decision was to first go to Nanjing to reconvene, and then immediately resolve to relocate, which was a legal procedure that the Legislative Yuan had to go through. Duan Jianmin loudly exclaimed, "I will not be someone else's tool." Fang Zhichao advocated first holding the meeting in Nanjing, and then relocating when the military situation in Jiangnan changed. Pan Chaoying said, "If the Executive Yuan says it is relocating its office, it should be approved by the Legislative Yuan. Why did President Tong abruptly move the Legislative Yuan's seal to Guangzhou?" Finally, Zou Zhifen, Chen Zifeng, and others spoke, stating that the legislators remaining in Guangzhou had no preconceived notions and hoped that everyone would unite and consider carefully. Cheng Cangbo then warmly invited six representatives to go to Nanjing on the night train from Shanghai to discuss the matter, because the focus was on Nanjing, not Shanghai. Zou then said that he had sent a telegram to President Tong on the 23rd and would make a decision after receiving a reply. The talk session ended at around 6:00 p.m.

[Our Dispatch] Over fifty legislators remaining in Shanghai, including Zhang Zhizhi, jointly telegraphed President Tong on the 24th, requesting that the meeting be postponed until a consensus was reached among all parties.

Preparations for Reconvening in Guangzhou; Legislative Yuan Spokesperson Denies

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 24th] The Legislative Yuan's spokesperson told our reporter on the 24th, "Our Guangzhou office has indeed received a telegram from Secretary-General Chen informing us that the third session of the Yuan will be held in Nanjing this month. Before receiving President Tong's telegram, the Guangzhou office could not possibly proceed with 'preparations for reconvening in Guangzhou.' Various reports are absolutely unfounded. As for entertaining legislators coming to Guangzhou, it is a responsibility that should be fulfilled in terms of affairs and cannot be confused with the reconvening issue. Regarding the entertainment method, there are unified regulations for each session, which are planned and handled by the Yuan."

Zhejiang Provincial Assembly to Discuss the Legislative Yuan's Reconvening Issue Today

Editorial

### Sincere Unity, Jointly Supporting the Perilous Situation

The first session of the third term of the Legislative Yuan has arrived, and the Secretariat has issued a notice to the legislators scattered throughout the country to begin registering from February 21st. The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureaus have added special sleeping cars to facilitate the legislators from Beijing and Hangzhou to travel to Nanjing to register. In today's increasingly serious situation where peace and war have not been decided, the Legislative Yuan has the necessity to reconvene as soon as possible. In particular, current national affairs and important issues such as finance and economy need to be resolved by the reconvening of the Legislative Yuan.

However, at the time of the adjournment of the second session of the Legislative Yuan, due to the sudden change in the military situation, the Xuzhou-Bengbu Campaign moved south to the banks of the Yangtze River, almost threatening the safety of Nanjing and Shanghai. Legislators in Nanjing, because the representative body should not be able to calmly convene under the gunfire, left Nanjing for other suitable locations. Some dispersed to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Hankou, and Hunan, while others went to Taiwan, Fuzhou, Guangzhou, Guilin, Kunming, and Chongqing. At this time, it seems to be difficult in fact for the Legislative Yuan to reconvene in Nanjing in the short term. The legislators remaining in Guangzhou jointly telegraphed President Tong Guanxian, expressing their opposition to the Yuan reconvening in Nanjing. At the same time, they sent representatives Zou Zhifen, Chen Zifeng, Pan Chaoying, and others to Shanghai to exchange views with the legislators in Shanghai on the issue of the reconvening location of the Legislative Yuan. It can be seen that whether the Legislative Yuan can reconvene in Nanjing this month is still a problem.

Our view on this issue is very simple. First, the legislators should display a spirit of sincere unity. Second, the Legislative Yuan should quickly achieve legal convening. For the current peace issue, reforming finance and economy, and reforming politics, we must come up with practical and effective measures. If the Executive Yuan has a way, it must be approved by the Legislative Yuan. Therefore, the reconvening of the Yuan is not only the earnest expectation of the people of the country, but also the duty of the legislators. Standing on the people's position, for the issue of the reconvening location of the Legislative Yuan, whether it is reconvening in Nanjing or reconvening in Guangzhou, it can be put aside, but the most important thing is to reconvene as soon as possible, and the reconvening cannot make a joke of a double-track case!

Peace is what the people of the country unanimously yearn for, and it is also what the government and the CCP are singing at the same time. However, objective facts in the past two months have proven that the road to peace is still rugged and uneven. Although the government authorities have fully demonstrated the spirit of "doing their best," the CCP seems to be clinging to the slogan of "revolution to the end," and military actions are still continuing, and they have not expressed their willingness to send representatives to negotiate or to cease fire and make peace on the spot. Under this situation, how will the government authorities "achieve peace"? This issue related to the life and death of the nation and the people must be carefully considered by all legislators from the position of representatives of the people.

The second is the financial and economic problem. Since the reform of the currency system in August last year, on the one hand, due to the uncertainty of the war and the huge financial expenditure, the national budget cannot be balanced. On the other hand, due to the continued expansion of the gold yuan, in just six or seven months, the [unable to read] quickly turned into the old legal tender, making the financial and economic crisis increasingly [unable to read]. If this continues, not only will the people not be able to survive, but the military, government, and teachers will not be able to live in peace, and it will also shake the foundation of the country. The reform of financial and economic measures is also imminent. However, how easy is it to talk about reform? The people have already suffered greatly from the exploitation when the gold yuan was created. Hearing about reform, they cannot help but be frightened. According to reports, the government authorities have already formulated a financial and economic reform plan, waiting only for Acting President Li to sign it before it can be announced and implemented. However, it is best to send this major issue related to the national economy and the people's livelihood to the Literary Yuan for discussion and approval before implementation. Otherwise, another application of the "emergency clause" in the Constitution, like the former Minister of Finance Wang Yunwu's muddle-headedness, doing things clumsily, and causing big problems, increasing the suffering of the people, is really unbearable. The legislators of the Legislative Yuan, who have always regarded themselves as representatives of the people, in this emergency period, how can they continue to have opinions on the issue of the reconvening location, listen to the people living in deep water, and allow the administrative officials to manipulate policies as experiments?

In short, if peace is not achieved, the people will not be able to survive; if the price increases do not stop, the people will not be able to live, and everything else is out of the question. Therefore, today is the most serious time for the country. If the whole country can maintain the spirit of "sharing weal and woe" and jointly support the current perilous situation, there may still be a glimmer of hope of "turning danger into safety." On the contrary, if the internal still cannot be united, and still want to make trouble with each other, let the politicians fall into the trap of spies, and do everything they can to split up the country, then what hope does the country have, and what hope do the people have? People's representatives, please don't forget the people behind you!

### Republican Congressmen Concerned About China Issue; 51 Meet with Secretary of State Acheson; Department Denies $1.5 Billion Emergency Aid to China

### Former Xiamen Mayor Chen Rongfang's Unprecedented Group Corruption; Received Bribes and Returned Over 100 Buildings of Enemy Property

[Our Xiamen Shipping News, 20th] Former Xiamen Mayor Chen Rongfang approved the return of the property of traitor Huang Shijin during his term, totaling more than 100 buildings, and received bribes totaling 120,000 US dollars, creating an unprecedented group corruption case in Xiamen. The traitor Huang Shijin, a native of Taiwan, was engaged in enemy espionage work before the War of Resistance. He used his power to seize a lot of industrial property in Xiamen. According to statistics, there were as many as 124 houses. Later, Huang Tao's 157th Division was stationed in Xiamen, and Huang Shijin was arrested after being reported and executed by the province, and all of his property was sealed. After the restoration of Xiamen, the property was allocated by the government to the municipal treasury. However, Huang's younger brother, Huang Shiming, did not agree with the government's handling of the matter and asked former Mayor Huang Tianjue to speak on his behalf. After three years, it was still ineffective. Recently, after the reorganization of the provincial government and Li Liangrong took over the Fujian government, Huang turned to the province. A month ago, the Provincial Standing Committee instructed Xiamen that "Huang Shijin's public property shall be returned after checking the evidence together with the Land Registration Office." After Mayor Chen Rongfang received this instruction, he sent personnel to contact Huang Shiming. As a result, Huang Shiming agreed to donate the building at No. 44 Puyou Street, valued at 120,000 US dollars. Unexpectedly, while the matter was in progress, Provincial Government Chairman Zhu Shaoliang announced the news of the change of mayor of Xiamen. In order to achieve his goal, the old mayor accelerated the process, ordering Huang Shiming to hand over 120,000 US dollars, promising to return all of the property during his term. On the 16th of the month, when the old and new mayors transferred, the municipal government issued a total of 99 instructions for return, which were issued by Chen Rongfang to the dispatch and reception room. The new mayor, Li Yixing, learned about it and detained all the return documents. However, more than ten copies (including the approval for the return of ten buildings) that had been issued in the previous few days could not be recovered, causing this huge bribery and release of enemy property case to shock Xiamen. According to the new mayor, he is determined to investigate the case thoroughly. It is heard that many people in Chen's mayoral office are involved, and he has decided to report to the provincial government for resolution. This huge corruption case involves Guo Guozhen, the former municipal government's receiver, Chief Secretary Huang Rongmin, and several section chiefs.

### Xu Kan's Explanation of Financial Reform

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 24th] Minister of Finance Xu Kan, in light of the Executive Yuan's passage of the Financial Reform Plan on the 23rd, held a press conference at the Central Bank at 4 p.m. on the 24th to explain the Financial Reform Plan as follows: "For several months, the government has advocated peace, hoping to resolve domestic disputes through political means, while actively preparing for military, political, and economic reforms, in order to recuperate and engage in peaceful reconstruction. Now that the government has moved south and the arrangements are roughly in place, reforms in the military and political areas are being studied and planned by the relevant authorities. Economic problems are centered on finance, and I, as head of finance, have an unshirkable responsibility to study and improve them. Therefore, after consulting extensively with relevant parties and conducting detailed discussions, I believe that the most pressing financial issues are the huge national treasury expenditures, shortfalls in revenue, and continued currency inflation. The biggest economic crises are shrinking production and shortages of materials. The way to remedy this is, first, to determine the principles of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, and to use other resources to curb currency inflation. Second, it is to use financial strength and trade policies to promote production, secure materials, regulate markets, and stabilize livelihoods. Based on the above intentions, a financial and economic reform plan was drafted and passed yesterday by the Kuomintang Central Political Committee and the Executive Yuan's executive meeting after revisions. The original plan was divided into five chapters: Finance, Monetary System, Import and Export Trade, Material Regulation, and Increased Production. Among them, the two chapters on Material Regulation and Increased Production are matters that should be handled by the various competent authorities, and there are no changes to existing laws. It was decided that the Executive Yuan should order the various competent authorities to earnestly plan and implement them. The remaining three chapters, Finance, Monetary System, and Import and Export Trade, were renamed the Financial Reform Plan, and the Executive Yuan requested the President to order their promulgation and implementation, and authorized the Executive Yuan to revise relevant laws and supplement legislative procedures. The important points of the plan are explained below:

Chapter One, Regarding Finance, is divided into eight items. Among them, the first two items are intended to determine the expenditure limits of military and political expenses. On the one hand, it will cooperate with the reform of military affairs and politics to reduce expenditures. On the other hand, it will improve the treatment of military, police, and public education personnel to stabilize their lives and improve their work efficiency. As for the improvement of the treatment of civil servants, it has been resolved in a separate case, so no special article is listed in this case. The second and third items are intended to enrich local finances and reduce the burden on the people. The government has long intended to return the land tax to the local governments and stop the requisition of grain. However, the demand for military grain is quite large, and it is difficult to find a replacement in a short period of time, so it has not been implemented. This time, we are determined to implement it thoroughly. Items four to eight are intended to make national tax revenue reliable and to prevent delays and opportunistic practices. Among them, the customs duty collection is to restore the old system of the previous customs gold unit. However, because customs gold notes were once used as currency in circulation and have now been abolished, they are referred to as customs yuan to avoid misunderstandings. For consumer goods tax such as cotton yarn, matches, and cement, which are produced centrally, we will switch to collecting in kind. We only need to count the goods in kind and extract them for application after a certain quantity is transferred, or sell them on the market. The procedures are extremely convenient, and it is not as piecemeal and trivial as collecting grain, or as wasteful and difficult as transferring and transporting it. The government can use this to control a portion of the materials for military and public use. As for the part of the official collection and transportation of salt, this is because the market interest rate has been too high recently, salt merchants lack funds, and production and sales have been hit hard. Some areas have already experienced production stoppages and transportation disruptions, and the government urgently needs to cooperate to remedy this.

Chapter Two, Regarding the Financial and Monetary System, is divided into five items. The main intention is to open up the free trading of gold and silver, and the free circulation of silver dollars. The government plans to mint a large number of silver dollars and increase their circulation, and use gold and silver to equalize market prices at any time to stabilize the value of gold yuan notes. On the one hand, in order to maintain the national system, foreign currency notes are still prohibited from circulation and are exchanged by the Central Bank at reasonable prices. At the same time, restrictions on the import of gold, silver, silver dollars, and foreign currency notes are relaxed to increase the reserves of gold and silver and gradually consolidate the foundation of the monetary system.

Chapter Three, Regarding Import and Export Trade, is divided into four items. The main improvement is to relax import restrictions. Except for consumer goods such as tobacco and asbestos, which cannot but maintain the quota allocation system from an economic point of view, other goods that are allowed to be imported can be transported and imported without applying for an import permit. Exporters who handle imports are also not restricted. The price of foreign exchange transfer certificates for foreign exchange earned from exports and remittances from overseas Chinese should not differ from the market price of foreign exchange to encourage exports and overseas remittances. At the same time, it also opens up the import of goods with self-provided foreign exchange to increase the source of imported materials. The above points are the main points of this financial reform and its main significance. The implementation methods and the laws to be revised are being drafted separately. Economic problems are extremely complex, and my talents are limited. What I see may not be complete, and the implementation of government orders depends on the support of the press and the public. I sincerely hope that you gentlemen will not hesitate to give your advice and assist in the implementation to achieve practical results. I would be very grateful.

### Main Obstacles to the Austrian Peace Treaty Removed; Yugoslavia Abandons Demand for Territorial Cession; Suggests Part of Galicia Province Be Changed to Autonomous; Room for Compromise Remains on Reparations Issue

[United Press, London, 24th] Yugoslavia indicated on the 24th that it was willing to compromise on its territorial and compensation demands to Austria. Thus, two major obstacles to the signing of a peace treaty with Austria have been partially eliminated. Yugoslav Foreign Minister Bebler stated at the meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers that Yugoslavia still wanted reparations and territory, but Bebler did not emphasize the previous specific demands. Bebler had been trying for at least two years to obtain reparations of $150 million and 728 square miles of Austrian territory. Today, he requested the following four items: (1) Modify the Austrian border in favor of Yugoslavia, with the exact demarcation to be determined in the future. (2) Grant political, economic and cultural autonomy to a part of Galicia, but not immediately to Yugoslavia. The residents of that area are mostly Slavic. (3) Huge reparations. (4) Guarantee the rights of the Slavic minority in Austria. This request is much more lenient than before. Yugoslavia had previously insisted that all areas in Austria where the Slavic population was in the majority should be transferred to Yugoslavia. The so-called areas where the Slavic population is in the majority are the 728 square mile area in southern Austria. The United States, Britain, and France had bluntly refused to change Austria's borders or force Austria to pay reparations, but Bebler's proposal has a strong hope of reaching a compromise.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 24th] Yugoslav Foreign Minister Bebler today asked the meeting of representatives of the four foreign ministers to make the Austrian province of Galicia, where Slavs are in the majority, an autonomous province within the scope of Austria. Bebler said: The Self-Governing Province should have its own independent administration, including having a security team, and a separate provincial government, parliament, and judicial power. Bebler also put forward four compromise methods: (1) Modify the existing border in favor of Yugoslavia. (2) The Slavic province of Galicia has political, economic, and cultural autonomy under Austria. (3) Austria shall make full compensation to Yugoslavia. (4) Slavs living in Austria outside the aforementioned autonomous region should be given protection of minority rights.

[United Press, London, 23rd] It is reported that Yugoslavia has decided on the 23rd to abandon its demand for the cession of 728 square miles of Austrian territory. This is one of the most important gaps in the Austrian peace treaty.

### Key Points of the Egyptian-Israeli Armistice Agreement: Israel Maintains the Areas Occupied at the Start of the War; Exchange of Prisoners of War to Be Completed Within Three Weeks

[Taiwan Public News Agency, Rhodes Island, 24th] Israel and Egypt signed an armistice agreement today, aimed at seeking a permanent peace in southern Palestine.

The full text includes twelve articles and three annexes. The armistice agreement does not need to be ratified again and will take effect immediately after signing.

The withdrawal time will begin at 5:00 a.m. on the 26th (World Standard Time), and they will be allowed to withdraw with weapons. (4) Exchange prisoners of war, starting ten days after the signing of the armistice agreement, and completing no later than twenty-one days after the signing. (5) Demarcate the Ogja on the Palestinian side of the Egyptian border as a demilitarized zone. The Egyptian-Israeli Armistice Committee, headed by UN Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Lee Lai, will work in the city. (6) No military or political advantage should be gained under the armistice. (7) Neither side will resort to force in resolving the Palestinian issue. (8) Both sides will not advance forward from their current occupied positions. (9) Issues concerning non-military demands and rights will be discussed later. (10) The coastal land from the Rafa front line on the border between Egypt and the Holy Land to Gaza, 20 miles within the Holy Land, will be guarded by Egyptian troops. Other troops must withdraw eastward to the areas of Al-Arish and Auja. (11) The Israeli invading troops will withdraw to the positions they occupied before the attack began on October 14 of last year, and the defense forces will continue to be stationed under special agreements. (12) Neither side shall take any warlike or hostile actions against the other side's military or paramilitary forces, or the people under their control. (13) The front line between the two countries should not be destroyed. Aircraft from one side should not cross the airspace of the other side, and ships from one side must not enter areas within three miles of the other side's coast.

### Austin's Speech on World Government

[Our Newspaper] New York, 24th Broadcast: Austin, the chief representative of the United States at the United Nations, said in a speech to a joint meeting of the lower house of the Vermont State Assembly that any attempt to establish a world government at present would inevitably divide the world into the American bloc, the Soviet bloc, and other national blocs that have not joined the above-mentioned blocs. Austin said that the only hope for a world government is to gradually develop work through the existing United Nations mechanism. Austin pointed out that some people who are enthusiastic about supporting world government are sarcastic about the United Nations and belittle efforts to strive for peace. Austin said that those who are currently talking about world government believe that all countries in the world except the Soviet bloc will join. In fact, Sweden, India, Iran, Turkey, and China, which are adjacent to the Soviet Union, are probably unlikely to join.

### Truman Receives Reporters and States: Continue to Promote the Aid to Europe Plan; Wallace Stresses the Need for a Meeting Between Stalin and Truman

[Our Newspaper] Washington, 24th Broadcast: President Truman said at a press conference today that the Marshall Plan will continue until Europe can be restored. When reporters cited British Undersecretary of State Mayhew's report to the United Nations Economic and Social Council yesterday, asking for Mr. Du's opinion (Mayhew said at the time that the economic recovery of the United Kingdom was almost complete), Mr. Du said that he was very happy to hear about the improvement in the British economic situation. The Marshall Plan will take four years. If the above news is true, then it may not be necessary to use all of it. However, if the full recovery of the United Kingdom will only be successful after four years, then the Marshall Plan must continue until that time. The President also announced today that he would transfer the current Undersecretary of Aviation, Whitey, to the position of Undersecretary of Commerce to succeed Foster, who had been transferred to the position of Deputy Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration last spring.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] When the House Foreign Affairs Committee discussed extending the Marshall Plan for another year today, Wallace attended and made a statement, predicting that if the United States and the Soviet Union could not resolve their disputes, it would cause another "Thirty Years' War," and advocating that Truman and Stalin immediately hold a meeting to discuss the problems between the two countries for a permanent solution. Wallace believes that the Marshall Plan has gone bankrupt, and he vehemently criticized the Atlantic Treaty. He suggested that the United States should abandon the "Cold War" policy.

It is reported that Czech President Gottwald rejected the plan, while Prime Minister Zapotocky was prepared to accept it.

The Czech Communists are patrolling the streets of Prague, and identity cards are often checked. This measure can be considered as the anniversary of the Czech Communist coup. According to a Communist Party warning, "reactionaries" are trying to attack the Communist Party in the Czech Republic "by all possible means."

### The First American Ship to Enter the Communist Area, the Fillmore, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; It Is Reported That the City of Tianjin Is as Quiet as Usual

[Our Newspaper] Following the return of the "Greater Shanghai" ship to Shanghai, the American President Lines' "Fillmore" ship returned to port from Tianjin at 1:00 p.m. yesterday. This is the first foreign ship to sail from the Communist area to Shanghai after the opening of national ships to North China. The ship previously sailed from San Francisco, carrying 1,400 tons of orders before the evacuation of Tianjin, including steel plates, western wax, pigments, etc. It arrived in Tianjin on the 19th of this month. It stayed in Tianjin for three days. Except for unloading the goods, all ship personnel were refused to land. According to Captain Pike of the ship: After the ship docked, representatives of the Tianjin People's Production Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, together with customs officials from Tianjin, boarded the ship for inspection. He tried to persuade them with coffee and cigarettes, but they refused. The inspectors were serious, but quite polite. According to his own eyes: the customs officials still wear the same uniforms as here, and the clothing of the Chinese Communist soldiers on the dock is similar to that of the national army. Even the barges used for unloading the goods are owned by the China Merchants Bureau. The manager of the Tianjin branch of the American President Company was specially permitted to board the ship when the ship arrived. According to him: The city of Tianjin is as quiet as usual, and all the personnel of the American consulate are still safe. On the ship, Chinese Communist Party personnel told him: If he is willing to go south with the ship, he can, but he will not be allowed to come to Tianjin again in the future. When the ship was about to leave, it was originally planned to load a batch of specialties from North China for export. This move had been approved by the Chinese Communist Party, but it failed due to unresolved issues such as exchange settlement. When the ship was about to leave, the Chinese Communist Party personnel told the crew: "If you come again next time, you may be able to go ashore and visit."

Also, according to a United Press dispatch from this city: Chinese Communist Party personnel who boarded the Fillmore avoided discussing politics, but one of them solemnly denied that the Chinese Communist Party "has any connection with Moscow." The Chinese Communist Party representative, Cao Yuanquan, spoke fluent American English and said: "Yes, we are communists, but we are not Soviet communists."

### Presidents of National Universities to Petition in Beijing Tomorrow Night, Requesting Rational Adjustment of Regular Expenses Based on Index-Linked Salaries

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, presidents of major national universities in the city gathered at Shanghai Medical College to discuss issues such as improving the salaries of faculty and staff and funding. As a result of the discussions, it was decided that all the presidents would travel to Beijing on the evening of the 27th to petition the central government in person, presenting their difficulties and requesting three points: (1) The adjustment of faculty and staff salaries by 75 times is still far from the original request and makes it impossible to live. It is requested that it be calculated by multiplying the current base salary by the Shanghai cost of living index. (2) The Ministry of Education telegraphed that the regular expenses for each school for February would be issued at ten times the standard for January. Taking Jiaotong University as an example, for a large school with thousands of people, the regular expenses for January were only over ten thousand yuan, which was not enough to cover even the odd expenses such as water and electricity. Therefore, it is requested that future regular expenses be adjusted in line with the current price level. (3) Regarding the issuance of contingency funds, it is requested that each school be given the same treatment as Central University's 1,000 dan of rice and 40 million yuan.

The presidents who will travel to Beijing on the evening of the 27th include Wang Zhizhuo of Jiaotong University, Zhang Yi of Fudan University, Xia Jianbai of Tongji University, Li Yong of Jinan University, Zhu Hengbi of Shanghai Medical College, Zhu Guozhang of Shanghai Business College, Zhou Junshi of Wusong Merchant Marine Vocational School, Dai Cuilun of Shanghai Conservatory of Music, Zhu Kezhen of Zhejiang University, Xia Shuyu of Senior Mechanical Vocational School, Chen Heqin of Kindergarten Normal School, and Qing Zhenxu, acting president of Tangshan Institute of Technology, a total of twelve people.

After obtaining the consent of Liu Zhe and others, they sent five representatives to attend the meeting to report on the distribution of Northeast materials and the situation of corruption, such as the fact that genuine Northeast people had not received relief and Feng Yun's receipt of funds. The supervisors comforted them and asked them to leave their contact addresses. Because they were busy registering and mistakenly believed that they were likely to receive relief funds, after the first batch of over one hundred people left, people continued to come one after another. It is said that soldiers and monks accounted for a considerable number of them. The Supervision Committee's office was in a state of chaos for a time, as if it was surrounded. Fortunately, the office handled it properly and no accidents occurred, and people were still going to register until late at night.

### From Xuzhou to Shanghai

Three Days for the Whole Trip

American Pastor Talks About the Current Situation in the Communist Area

Religious Freedom Has Not Been Violated

[Report from our newspaper] Yesterday, an American pastor, Bo Peng, 72 years old, arrived in Shanghai from Xuzhou. Pastor Brown has been preaching in Xuzhou for 37 years and has a hospital. This time, he came to Shanghai to find a way to deal with the lack of medicine. He took a truck from Xuzhou to the canal area, and then took a civilian boat south along the canal, which only took three days for the whole trip. According to him, after the Communist army occupied Xuzhou, the work of the church was not hindered, the hospital was still open as usual, and the school was on winter vacation, and some teachers had to receive training. Some Communist troops were stationed in primary schools, and some entered Catholic churches, but they did not forcibly occupy civilian houses. Religious freedom has obviously not been violated. Chinese people still come to Brown's church to worship. Although there are Communist troops stationed in other churches, they can still openly state their beliefs. However, he had heard that religious activities were indeed banned in two remote small towns outside the railway line.

The Communist army did not restrict his actions. When he left Xuzhou, he planned to get a "pass", but the Communist army said, "The Japanese wanted a pass, and the Kuomintang also wanted a pass, but we don't need this kind of trouble."

Regarding the current situation in Xuzhou, he said that most of the shops have not opened, but street vendors are active. Silver dollars are worth 24,000 yuan in banknotes from the Beihai Bank, and the price is very stable. Gold yuan coupons can still be circulated for one or two months, but the price fluctuates greatly. The city's power supply is better than during the Kuomintang's occupation. The redistribution of land has not yet been implemented. The Communist army told him that there is no need to forcibly implement land reform. Trains have also been restored. They can travel west to Zhengzhou for 250 miles, south to Suxian for 70 miles, north to Jinan for 120 miles, and east to Haizhou for 75 miles, but they all run at night.

Finally, the police learned from his niece's statement that Zhu lived at No. 32 Yuqing Lane, East Changzhi Road. They immediately rushed there and confiscated a handgun with five bullets in the chamber, another thirty bullets, and some of the stolen goods. A man feigning illness, Ge Zongxiang, was also apprehended in the room. After investigation at the bureau, it was revealed that Ge was also one of the accomplices.

### Textile Construction Continues to Sell as Usual; Yarn and Cloth Price Increase Still Intense

[Our Newspaper] The price increase of cotton yarn has begun again. Credit is generally loose in the market, and there are many long positions in the industry. Because secret interest rates are too low, most are unwilling to discount and lend, and instead tend to buy and absorb. Guest merchants are still not very active.

### City Chamber of Commerce Again Cables the Executive Yuan: Requests the Opening of Yarn and Cloth Transportation to the South

[Our Newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce, based on a letter from the Transshipment Commercial Association, regarding the ban on yarn and cloth transportation to the south, which affects people's livelihoods and industrial and commercial affairs, requests assistance in negotiating the lifting of the ban. They sent a cable to the Executive Yuan yesterday stating: "Investigating the measures restricting yarn and cloth transportation to the south hinders industrial and commercial development, increases the difficulty of clothing for the people of South China, and is more harmful than beneficial. After repeated appeals, it was ordered to be abolished in November 1937. Unexpectedly, after only two months of free transportation, the previous order was suddenly reinstated, making people feel at a loss. Since the turning point in the overall situation, it has been difficult to sell Shanghai yarn and cloth in the vast areas of North China. Only the corner of South China has a small amount of room for maneuver, but now even this path has been blocked, causing the entire textile industry to suffocate. This cannot be explained. Government agencies are evacuating south, but the transportation of daily necessities such as yarn and cloth is restricted to the south, which is contradictory. Moreover, the scope of transportation to the south includes Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. Guangdong and Yunnan only have one or two yarn factories, while Guizhou and Guangxi have no yarn factories. The disparity between supply and demand will further exacerbate the difficulty of clothing in those provinces. To say that this is suppressing prices is a complete contradiction. This cannot be explained. The number of troops stationed in the city has increased, and the cost of non-staple food is enormous. Recently, it was proposed that various industries share the burden, with the textile industry bearing the most. In addition to taxes, a large burden has been added. However, on the one hand, its vitality is stifled, and its sales are restricted. This cannot be explained. Therefore, we do not hesitate to sell out our assets and telegraphically submit this to your esteemed court for review. We respectfully request that you examine the above-mentioned sections of the previous telegram and abolish the measures of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce restricting yarn and cloth transportation to the south, which would be for the public convenience, etc."
