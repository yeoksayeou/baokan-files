### President Issues New Year's Day Message: Key to War or Peace Lies with the Communists; Constitution Cannot Be Violated, National Independence and Integrity Must Be Maintained; Army Should Be Guaranteed, People Must Maintain Freedom of Life

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] President Chiang Kai-shek recently issued a New Year's Day message for the 38th year of the Republic of China. The full text is as follows:

Fellow countrymen, today is the founding anniversary of the 38th year of the Republic of China. Since the founding of the Republic of China by the Father of the Nation's advocacy of the National Revolution, a full thirty-seven years have passed. During this long period, revolutionary martyrs and patriotic soldiers and civilians shed blood and sacrificed themselves, fought steadfastly, endured setbacks, and experienced hardships before the Constitution could be implemented and constitutional government established. Today, holding the first founding anniversary after the establishment of the constitutional government, we deeply feel that time has been wasted and that the cause of national construction has been so delayed. The Three Principles of the People have not been realized, and we are truly filled with shame and remorse. Tracing back to after the end of the War of Resistance, the government's sole policy was peaceful construction, and the government's primary task was to recover the Northeast, which had been occupied for fourteen years, in order to maintain the integrity of our national territory and sovereignty. However, for three years, the policy of peaceful construction has been obstructed, and the work of receiving the Northeast has failed. In the past year alone, since the loss of Jinan, Jinzhou, Changchun, and Shenyang have fallen successively, and the tragedy of the September 18th Incident has been re-enacted in the nine northeastern provinces. The areas where industry and commerce are concentrated in East China and North China, and the cities where academic culture gathers, are today all threatened by banditry. The government's aspirations to defend the country and save the people have not been achieved, and the crisis of the nation has become more serious. This is due to Chiang Kai-shek's personal lack of leadership and improper measures, which have failed to live up to the trust placed in him by the people. I am truly ashamed and terrified, and should first blame myself.

Today, the military suppression of the rebellion has entered a critical stage. The survival of the nation, the rise and fall of the people, and the continuation of historical culture will all be decided in this stage. The freedom or enslavement, life or death, of every one of our compatriots and every family will also be decided in this stage. How to overcome this difficulty and overcome this crisis has become a matter of great concern to every one of our compatriots, and everyone feels the great importance of the government's current decisions, because the military suppression of bandits has increased the burden on the people and deepened their suffering. Even millionaires hope that the war will end as soon as possible and peace will be realized as soon as possible. Therefore, the question of war or peace lingers in the hearts of every compatriot, and the government's choice of war or peace is even more concerned by every compatriot. Chiang Kai-shek, entrusted by the people and responsible for the country, should conduct a detailed review of the current situation and give deep consideration to the hopes of the people.

Only Hoping Peace Can Be Realized, Personal Advance or Retreat is Absolutely Not a Concern

The Father of the Nation said, "The purpose of the founding of the Republic of China is peace." As a believer in the Three Principles of the People, Chiang Kai-shek, inheriting the teachings of the Father of the Nation, was originally unwilling to follow the war against Japan with the military suppression of bandits, in order to increase the suffering of the people. Therefore, as soon as the War of Resistance ended, our government immediately raised the policy of peaceful construction, and further used political consultations and military mediation methods to solve the Communist Party problem. Unexpectedly, after a year and a half, the Communist Party obstructed all agreements and plans, making them unable to be implemented according to the expected steps. And finally, it launched a full-scale armed rebellion, endangering the survival of the country. Our government was forced to endure the pain and mobilize to engage in suppressing the rebellion. This is the recent historical fact, fresh in the minds of the world. Communism has been developing in China for twenty-five years, and in these twenty-five years, Chiang Kai-shek has always expected the Communist Party to take the nation as the premise, restore the normal course of party politics, and jointly seek ways of peaceful coexistence, in order to establish the grand rules of democracy. For three years, the purpose of political consultations has been peace, and the purpose of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion has also been peace. But today, whether the situation is for war or peace, whether the people are blessed or cursed, the key lies not with the government, nor can it be achieved by the one-sided hopes of our compatriots for the government. It must be known that the decision of this problem rests entirely with the Communist Party. Whether the country can turn danger into safety and whether the people can turn disaster into blessing depends on a change of heart on the part of the Communist Party. Therefore, our compatriots, in order to solve this problem, must first ask the Communist Party what their intentions are for peace. As long as the Communist Party has the sincerity for peace and can make a definite expression, the government will sincerely discuss and be willing to discuss concrete methods for stopping the war and restoring peace. As long as the peace talks do not harm the independence and integrity of the country, but help the people to recuperate and rest. As long as the sacred Constitution is not violated by me, and democratic constitutionalism is not destroyed because of this, the national system of the Republic of China can be ensured. The legal system of the Republic of China will not be interrupted, the army has a real guarantee, and the people can maintain their free way of life and the current minimum living standards, then I personally have no other demands. Chiang Kai-shek has spent his life in revolution and has long put life and death out of consideration. Only hoping that peace can be realized, personal advance or retreat is absolutely not a concern, but only follows the public opinion of the people. If the Communist Party insists on continuing the armed rebellion to the end and has no sincerity for peace, then the government has only to fulfill its duty to defend the country and save the people, and it cannot but deal with the Communist Party to the end, especially in the Jing-Hu area, where the political center is located, and it must do its best to defend it and carry out a decisive battle. I firmly believe that the government not only has the confidence to win here, but also the key to the entire country turning danger into safety and the entire people turning disaster into blessing lies here. Our compatriots must know that today, only by the unity of the military and the people, adhering to this war of self-defense, and winning victory in the decisive battle, can we win true peace, and only by enduring temporary pain and sacrifice can we avoid the heavy iron curtain and the dark and dismal life of hell. Since I, Chiang Kai-shek, participated in the revolutionary war, it has been nearly forty years. In every long-term battle, I have experienced hardships, suffered setbacks, and endured slander. No matter how far I failed, I always held the belief that I would win, and in the end, I would be able to achieve success. It must be known that what we rely on is the national spirit, human justice, and world justice. The violence of the Communist bandits can rob us of the Northeast, but cannot conquer our national spirit, can invade our hinterland, but cannot insult the personality of our nation. Justice is the power to win, and public opinion will eventually overcome violence. Our generation has encountered unprecedented changes in the five thousand years of Chinese history, and we must also shoulder the unprecedented mission in the five thousand years of history. We can only endure temporary pain and sacrifice, and struggle for the survival of the country and nation, the continuation of historical culture, the freedom of lifestyle, and the growth of future generations.

Fellow countrymen, at this time of renewal of the year, recalling the hardships of the Father of the Nation and the martyrs in creating the Republic of China, and understanding the pain of the soldiers and civilians on the front line fighting steadfastly, I feel that Chiang Kai-shek's personal responsibility is great and the duties are arduous, and I also firmly believe that my patriotic compatriots will never tolerate the Communist Party's liquidation, nor can they sit idly by and watch the country's peril. Only by the unity of the military and the people, the unity of the whole country, unity and struggle, ensuring our democratic and free life, doing our best to fulfill our duty to defend the country and protect the race, and reaping the fruits of the eight-year War of Resistance, can we comfort the spirits of our countless soldiers, civilians, and martyrs in heaven. The Father of the Nation said, "The final success belongs to the last effort," and I would like to encourage all my compatriots. (End)

### Xu Yongchang's New Year's Broadcast Encourages Soldiers to Complete the Suppression of the Rebellion

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] Minister Xu of the Ministry of National Defense is scheduled to broadcast to officers and soldiers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force across the country on New Year's Day at the military radio station, as well as to veterans in their hometowns. The original text roughly stated: The country is currently in a state of crisis and shock. Comrades, whether in the front or in the rear, are enduring hardship and difficulty. Therefore, Yongchang keenly feels the great responsibility of our soldiers, and at the same time, he is particularly concerned about the steadfast and outstanding spirit of all comrades. Although the battle line is vast and transportation is obstructed, making it impossible for us to personally comfort each and every one of you, I believe that the entire army, as well as our more than 190,000 retired and discharged officers and soldiers, have the same enthusiasm for saving the country from crisis and the same belief in the future of the country and the national army. In other words, Yongchang and the comrades scattered throughout the country are connected and unified in spirit. I hope that we can all base ourselves on this most precious connection and unity, unite sincerely, work hard, and achieve the tasks that each of us should fulfill.

Our main task now is naturally to suppress the rebellion. Talking about the success of suppressing the rebellion, military affairs naturally come first. Therefore, our most urgent problem at present is victory at the front. Therefore, all officers and soldiers now are closely related to the safety of the country. Everyone should realize the mission of suppressing the rebellion and building the country with the determination to become benevolent and take righteousness under the leadership of the Supreme Commander.

### New Year's Message for the Thirty-Eighth Year

January 1st marks the beginning of a new year and the founding of the Republic. Every year on this day, celebrations are held. Spurred by this dual significance, and with a mix of emotions and melancholy, we feel the fleeting time is hard to grasp, but the future is attainable, and a spark of vitality accompanies the arrival of the new year. The end of the thirty-seventh year was marked by a low-pressure system enveloping Shanghai. Gloom and sorrow intertwined, and disasters multiplied. Everyone felt a sense of heaviness, and their actions showed signs of anxiety. This heaviness and anxiety should be a shared experience, not an individual's abnormality. Now, as we welcome the freshness of the thirty-eighth year, we want to dispel the misfortunes of the past. We do not wish to sing celebratory praises, nor to engage in complex political discussions. At this time, we offer humble wishes from the perspective of ordinary people:

Since the Japanese invaders wreaked havoc and spread poison everywhere, our country has endured eight years of sacred resistance, leaving it exhausted in body and spirit. The sudden arrival of victory brought joy to the world. The martyrs who shed their blood have made the ultimate sacrifice, gaining the ultimate reward. The survivors also hoped for a new opportunity for prosperity. However, peace did not last long, and chaos returned. With the onset of artillery fire, homes were reduced to ashes. The direct losses from the war were the wasteful destruction of countless lives and the displacement of large numbers of refugees. The indirect impact caused economic turmoil, disrupted livelihoods, and left people suffocating under a cloud of sorrow, longing for a return to normalcy. We sincerely hope that after the thirty-eighth year, the smoke of war will be extinguished forever, and families will once again find peace. May hostility be transformed into harmony, and the people be settled in comfort. May hundreds of millions of people be able to devote themselves to increasing production and jointly strive for the rejuvenation of the nation. This is our first sincere prayer.

Since the Second World War, the painful and devastating lessons have been deeply ingrained in people's hearts. If you were to ask Europeans and Americans about the need for war, almost all would express their firm opposition. However, the confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States hints at the brewing of future dangers. The Cold War in Berlin is intensifying. Playing with fire next to a pile of firewood, or practicing swimming in an unpredictable abyss, can easily lead to self-destruction. Lessons of the past remain, but no one heeds the warning. Does this crisis need further discussion? In reality, the United States and the Soviet Union do not share borders. In the past, they shared hardships. Even if they have differing ideologies and harbor mutual suspicions, they can still resolve their differences through other means of reconciliation. Why must they resort to war? If both sides can empathize with the common people, reflect on their own actions, follow the path of openness and sincerity, and abandon deception and suspicion, they can easily transform the current situation and stabilize the overall situation. Then, by gathering technical experts from various countries and strengthening the application of atomic energy, they can create extraordinary achievements for the medical community and open a new chapter in human history. This is our second earnest hope.

Today, people at all levels of our country are calling for political reform, but discussions are varied and inconclusive. Let's put aside the issues of corruption and focus on the efficiency of ordinary administration. Those who govern are not necessarily incompetent, and those who carry out orders are not necessarily corrupt. However, officials and the people often fail to connect, and cooperation between superiors and subordinates is difficult. Why is this so? Some argue that the current problem in officialdom is the emphasis on negligence and perfunctoriness, knowing only how to protect face and neglecting the suffering of the people. This is the root cause of the deterioration. Because of the desire to protect face, they exaggerate and embellish, lacking any standards. They offer empty promises when things are difficult to do, and deny obvious facts as rumors. This severely undermines the people's trust. Because they neglect the people's suffering, they impose strict rules and heavy taxes, changing policies frequently, as if playing a game of chess. Even if the people suffer great losses, they dismiss them as unfortunate circumstances and ignore them. In this situation, there is no hope for the people's unity, let alone cooperation. To remedy this, those in government should show a spirit of reform and prioritize winning back the hearts of the people. They should establish the credibility of the government and earn the love and respect of the people. Before issuing a public notice or making a speech, they should carefully consider it. Afterwards, they should maintain a firm and unwavering will, relying on facts and avoiding empty words. Changing policies frequently, like a monkey trainer deceiving his monkeys, or covering one's ears while stealing a bell, is foolish and should be strictly prohibited. The people have suffered repeated setbacks and are already weary and in need of care. They are easily swayed by food and drink when hungry and thirsty. If those in power can be considerate and show compassion, offering opportunities for rest and recovery, then the people will surely be grateful. Once love and respect are established, the effects of unity will be seen. With a foundation of cooperation between officials and the people, we can then strive for a comprehensive political reform. This is our third ardent expectation.

All of the above may seem general and commonplace. However, facts show that there is no other way. If we can fulfill these wishes, we will be greatly comforted. Even if we cannot achieve unanimous agreement, we hope to at least address a fraction of the public's concerns.

### Truman Tells Reporters That Aid to China Is Under Consideration; Will Submit to Congress in Due Course

[United Press, Washington Dispatch from the 30th] President Truman disclosed at a press conference on the 30th that aid to China is under consideration and that the issue will be submitted to Congress in due course. At the same time, the President indirectly disclosed that aid to China is not a top priority on the government's agenda and will not be among the first requests submitted to Congress. He said that further American aid to the Nationalist government would be included in his message to the new Congress. However, Truman pointed out that, technically, the current aid program will not expire until April 1 next year, when the Economic Cooperation Administration's current funds will be exhausted. It is generally interpreted that the President's statement means the government believes there is still much time before submitting the matter to Congress.

Truman said that while announcing that the current Chinese government is the government recognized by the whole world, it is inconceivable that Acting Secretary of State Lovett would call the leaders of the current Chinese government controlled by the Communists, including President Chiang, war criminals. Lovett's remarks were quite accurate.

Answering a question, the President said that he had not scheduled another meeting with Madame Chiang, but this did not eliminate the possibility of seeing Madame Chiang if she requested another meeting.

[United Press, Washington Dispatch from the 31st] A senior government official said on the 31st that Truman's new budget will include provisions for increased aid to China.

State Department spokesman McDermott denied that the United States would suspend aid to China, saying that the Chinese government continues to receive aid under the $400 million economic and military assistance program passed by the 80th Congress. However, the State Department's explanation only refers to the continuation of existing aid programs, and almost three-quarters of the $400 million has already been used.

The senior government official did not indicate that Truman planned to halt the ongoing aid program, but he insisted that the administration would not propose further action unless the Chinese government reformed its leadership.

I have been abroad for seven years, and it is time to return." Barkley said that he never entered the Soviet-occupied zone during his visit to Europe and therefore did not meet with any Soviets.

[U.S. News Agency Washington 30th dispatch] President Truman told reporters today that he had made a firm statement in Kansas City earlier this week, in which he stated that some Soviet leaders wanted to reach an understanding with the United States. At the same time, he accused the Soviet government of having a set of immoral morals and tearing up the Potsdam and Yalta agreements. He expressed regret at the Soviet government's contempt for international agreements and said that he felt sorry because the Soviet people themselves were a great nation.

Today, when reporters insisted on explaining his speech, Truman replied that what he had said was clear and without concealment. He said that he had not maintained contact with any Soviet leaders who could be considered friendly to the United States. A reporter asked whether Vice President-elect Barkley had spent Christmas with U.S. airlift personnel in Berlin and whether Barkley had met with Soviet representatives to lay the groundwork for future U.S.-Soviet negotiations. Truman replied that such speculation was excessive and that the rumor was unfounded.

### French Budget Expected to Be Approved by Parliament

[United Press Paris 31st dispatch] The French Senate, the Council of the Republic, rejected the government's 1949 budget after an all-night meeting on the 31st, with a vote of 105 to 0, 85 abstentions, and another 122 absent. The bill has been sent back to the National Assembly for a second reading, and if it passes by a majority vote, it will become law. Due to the attitude of the Gaullist faction, the Council of the Republic's rejection was expected, but it is still not enough to shake the Guy Mollet cabinet. In the National Assembly, Guy Mollet can obtain at least 310 votes to pass this 1.9 trillion franc budget and overturn the Council of the Republic's veto.

### Soviet Union Questions MacArthur's Arming of Japan, Truman Issues Statement, Believes the Claim Is Completely Groundless

[United Press Washington 30th dispatch] A State Department spokesman said on the 30th that the claim that General MacArthur had suggested that the United States should take action to rearm Japan was "groundless." Later, President Truman said in response to a question at a press conference that he had never heard of MacArthur ordering the rebuilding of the Japanese army or the rebuilding of Japanese highways damaged by the war.

This matter was raised by Soviet Ambassador to the United States and representative to the Far Eastern Commission, Panyushkin, at a meeting of the Commission. He said: "Newspapers in the United States recently published a message indicating that MacArthur had submitted a report to Washington suggesting the rebuilding of the Japanese army. The issue of rearming Japan has also been mentioned." Panyushkin continued: "A newspaper message also linked this plan to rearm Japan with MacArthur's recent order to the Japanese government to draft a five-year plan to build Japanese highways. The Soviet delegation believes that the U.S. representative must submit a report to the Far Eastern Commission."

[U.S. News Agency Washington 30th dispatch] President Truman returned to the White House after spending the Christmas holiday in his hometown of Missouri. At today's press conference, a reporter asked: According to news reports, MacArthur suggested restoring Japan's war potential, and Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin asked the United States to explain this point at the Far Eastern Commission. What is the President's opinion? Truman replied: He had not seen the news, and the report was also news to him.

### MacArthur Issues New Year's Message, Praises the Japanese People, Allows the Ubiquitous Display of the Rising Sun Flag as a Beacon of Light

[U.S. News Agency Tokyo 1st dispatch] Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers General MacArthur, in his New Year's message to the Japanese people, praised the Japanese people's efforts to establish a self-sufficient economy.

[Associated Press Tokyo 31st dispatch] MacArthur today submitted a lengthy message to Japanese newspapers for publication on New Year's Day, allowing the Japanese people to display the national flag far and wide as a beacon of light to call on all the people to fulfill their obligations to build the economy and preserve freedom.

In addition to praising Japan's progress, MacArthur occasionally warned that political freedom and economic self-sufficiency are interdependent and inseparable. The January 23rd parliamentary elections will test the wisdom of the Japanese people in selecting leaders. The period that has just ended is of great historical significance to Japan and the world in solving human suffering. However, due to conflicting ideologies and the ambitions of selfish people, the post-war situation remains chaotic, and progress has been unstable. However, there are more and more people of various countries and nationalities who are realistic and resolutely face the realities of history, knowing that war has never been and can never be a panacea for healing human diseases after repeated trials, and therefore diligently seek other methods to lead mankind towards progress that can only be achieved by abolishing war and peacefully resolving all problems. This is a gratifying point.

### U.S. Financial Situation

Deficit of $1 Billion Last Year

Total Debt Exceeds $250 Billion

[United Press Washington 31st dispatch] The U.S. government's financial situation at the beginning of 1949 is roughly as follows: (1) It would be fortunate if revenue and expenditure could be balanced in the next 12 months, but it will be difficult to achieve this without raising taxes. (2) The government's outstanding debt is almost six times its revenue, and at least one-sixth of it will mature in 1949. However, the government is a seasoned debtor and has its own ways. If there are no surplus funds to repay, it will borrow new debt to repay old debt. The more funds needed, the more it will borrow. The U.S. government's expenditure in 1948 was nearly $42 billion, with a deficit of more than $1 billion. The amount of debt has exceeded $252 billion, with annual interest of $5.3 billion. The most important thing is the impact of the government's financial management on the general business and employment situation. The government is the nation's largest buyer, employer, and interest payer, and the level of interest rates it pays can change the entire economy. If the government raises interest rates, it will indirectly increase commercial interest rates and reduce its activities, which is an anti-inflationary action. In 1948, the U.S. government adopted an anti-inflationary policy in finance: (1) Repaying $5 billion of old debt with the budget surplus in the fiscal year ending at the end of June. (2) Repaying bonds held by the Federal Reserve Banks and others with the proceeds from the sale of savings bonds to reduce the supply of funds or purchasing power. (3) Stabilizing the interest on government bonds that can be sold at 2.5% per annum while raising the interest on other short-term treasury bills to more than 1%. However, because of the repayment of a portion of old debt and the replacement of old bonds with new treasury bills with lower interest rates, its interest expenditure is sufficient to offset. The government bonds maturing in 1949 are the same as in 1948, totaling approximately slightly less than $110 billion, a portion of which will be repaid with the issuance of new bonds.

### Dutch Newspapers Attack the Arrest of the Indonesian President

Netherlands Announces the Abolition of Censorship

[United Press Batavia 31st dispatch] Dutch military authorities announced on the 31st that military and political censorship of news in Indonesia has been lifted. At the same time, well-informed Dutch sources accused some domestic newspapers of making unfair attacks on Indonesian High Commissioner Beel, especially regarding Beel's "diplomatic blunders" such as the arrest of Indonesian President Sukarno. They claimed that the imprisonment of Indonesian leaders was decided in The Hague, and Beel was simply acting on orders. Beel was also attacked for allegedly ordering the United Nations military observers to withdraw from the battlefield, but this is not true.

### Counterfeit U.S. Dollar Ring Cracked in Chicago

Four Japanese Ring Leaders Arrested

[United Press Washington 31st dispatch] According to Special Agent Bowman, Chicago special agents arrested four Japanese counterfeiters on the night of the 29th and seized four copper plates for printing $20 U.S. notes and 13 photographic negatives for printing $20 and $50 notes.

### Indonesian Leaders Condemn the Security Council's Weakness on Dutch Actions; Unable to Make Any Fair Decisions Thus Far

[United Press Singapore, 30th] A broadcast from the Indonesian Republic radio station "Somewhere in Sumatra" overheard here on the 30th stated that the Republic's army is concentrating in southern Sumatra to prevent Dutch paratroopers from landing. The broadcast said that the Republic's army will implement a scorched earth policy "without hesitation and thoroughly."

[United Press Singapore, 30th] A broadcast from the Indonesian Republic radio station "Somewhere in Sumatra" overheard here today stated that the Indonesian Republic's emergency government, led by Dr. Halim, issued a statement on the 29th condemning the Security Council's "feeble actions" regarding the Indonesian issue. The broadcast stated: "Information received indicates clearly that the Security Council has thus far been unable to make any fair and just decisions. The Indonesian people and government will continue to resist Dutch aggression and fight until they achieve complete independence." The broadcast also stated that the Republic's army "recaptured Pinchi, 18 kilometers from Medan, after fierce fighting."

[United Press Paris, 30th] The Indonesian representative to the United Nations Security Council, Palar, told reporters today: "As long as the leaders of the Indonesian Republic are detained and as long as the Dutch troops do not withdraw to their original positions, there will be no possibility of negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands." He said that the Netherlands' disregard for the Security Council's ceasefire order is forcing the Indonesian army to continue to resist until the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies are militarily, economically, and financially exhausted. The Netherlands is plotting to establish a unilaterally controlled provisional Indonesian federal government. Dutch Prime Minister Drees's trip to Indonesia is nothing more than a smokescreen to prevent foreign interference. The Netherlands' estimated time to conquer Indonesia has been extended from three months to nine months.

[United Press Washington, 30th] Indonesian spokesman Djelaluddine Goegoes Soemoedi Ningrat issued a statement on the 30th stating: "The people of Asia are deeply disappointed with the Security Council's handling of the Indonesian issue." He continued, "I hope the United States government will continue to exert pressure to resolve the Indonesian issue on a fair and appropriate basis. Indonesia's independence must not be hindered; the interests of all of Southeast Asia are related to this struggle." He said that Indonesia will confront the Netherlands with "guerrilla warfare and a scorched earth policy."

### Gaoqiao District Office Urges Improvement of City Ferry Facilities

Zhong Yuliang, the head of Gaoqiao District in this city, telegraphed the city government, the Maritime Administration Bureau, and the Pudong Association yesterday, as well as various relevant agencies, stating that the restrictions on the number of passengers carried by ships are very strict, and they have been abandoned for a long time. The supervisors have not interfered, and the city ferry company has been reorganized for two years. Old ships from 20 years ago are used, which is already dangerous, and carrying passengers over the limit is regarded as a normal thing. On Sundays, Mondays, and Saturdays, the number of passengers is especially crowded, and the number of passengers exceeds more than half of the capacity. However, every time there is a price increase, they are brave enough to be the pioneer of each ship, and they have never heard of business improvement. Moreover, using a long rectangular wharf without a bow, without a stern, and without a passenger license domino-style, the installation of machinery is used for long-distance passenger transportation, which is a bad precedent for the shipping industry. If this is not changed for a long time, the same mistake as the Jiangya Wheel can be used as a warning. In particular, an appeal is made to telegram the company to quickly improve, and to order all agencies to strictly investigate and protect passenger safety.

### Public and Private Teachers' Deposit Exchange; All Agencies After the 31st; Payment Starts Today; Review and Exchange Will Be Handled Five Days Later

[Report from Our Newspaper] The certificates of public and private teachers listed in the Shanghai Public and Private Personnel Material Supply Committee's allocation of in-kind goods for December, 134 units, have now been issued in full. Among them, the public and private agencies that were drawn before the 30th have already paid and received the gold. The City Bank has scheduled to handle the procedures for collecting certificates and cash from the 31st to the 4th of January, from 9 am to 5 pm every day. Each public and private agency can send two representatives to submit all the permits, ID cards, and cash to the City Bank on Jiujiang Road within the specified time. The City Bank will also send the received documents and cash to the Central Bank every day as a handover procedure. The actual review and exchange of gold procedures will be postponed until after the 5th. If any procedures are found to be inconsistent during the review stage, the payment documents will still be returned and the deposit exchange will not be allowed. In addition, the City Bank's collection of documents and cash from the 1st to the 4th is in the order of the arrival of the representatives of each unit.

Eight Units of State-Owned Enterprises Have Achieved Resolution Through Justification

In addition, the deposit exchange matters of eight units of state-owned enterprises have been discussed with Liu Gongyun, the vice president of the State Bank, by representatives sent by the units. Originally, it was almost shelved due to the change in the nature of the deposit exchange method. Later, after justification, it was heard that a solution has been obtained. The method is that the State Bank will allocate a sum of gold and distribute it equally among the eight units. However, the number of employees in each unit varies. For those with more employees, such as the two railway bureaus with more than 9,000 employees, each person can only get about one qian. For other units, such as the telecommunications bureau, each person can get about two qian. However, because it is difficult to divide, each unit plans to entrust a silver shop to melt it into a commemorative ring and then distribute it to each employee to wear. After hearing the news that the State Bank authorities agreed to exchange gold, the employees of the eight units, although they could not satisfy their desire for one tael of gold, still felt that it was better than nothing.

### Director Wu Came and Went in a Hurry; Discussing Technical Issues of Deposit Exchange

[Report from Our Newspaper] The new method of depositing and exchanging gold and silver has not been announced for a long time. In order to show solemnity, the Ministry of Finance yesterday sent Wu Xingzhou, the director of the Currency Department of the Ministry, to Shanghai to discuss various technical issues of deposit exchange with the authorities of the State Bank. After arriving in Shanghai, Wu Lou met with Liu Gongyun, the vice president of the State Bank, Li Xiaozhuang, the deputy director of the Business Bureau, and Bi Delin, the director of the Gold Management Bureau, in the meeting room of the Central Bank at Wai Tan at around 10 am to conduct a discussion. It was heard that Wu inquired in detail about the past deposit exchange situation of the State Bank. As for how to improve the new deposit exchange method technically and how to prevent purchasers from re-profiting from it, although it was stated that it was not mentioned at the meeting, it is believed that there must be a detailed review for the Ministry of Finance to use as a reference when drafting the new method. The meeting yesterday did not end until around 11 am. Because it was exploratory in nature, the expectation of the outside world that the new deposit exchange method would be announced immediately after the meeting was not realized. And Director Wu also hurriedly took the opinions obtained in this meeting and returned to Beijing last night to report back.

### This Month's Rice Ration to Be Sold on the 6th; Rice Rations Not Received in November; Still Available for Purchase Until the 4th

Mayor Wu convened the 39th Sino-American Food Conference at the City Hall yesterday. Representatives from the US Aid Application Committee, the US Economic Cooperation China Branch, the Food Department Emergency Purchase and Storage Committee, and the People's Food Allocation Office attended. After the meeting, according to the person in charge of the People's Food Allocation Office, (1) The January rice ration is now being transferred to rice shops throughout the city and will be sold from January 6th to the 31st, (2) The ration price will be approved at a three-person subgroup meeting on the 3rd and announced on the 4th, (3) Recently, there has been an accumulation of broken rice. In January, the old method will still be followed, with each certificate for 15 catties of rice, 3 catties of broken rice will be matched, and the remaining 12 catties will be whole rice. According to the news from the conference, it was decided at this meeting to suspend the allocation of rice for the December plan and postpone it until the end, and then make up for it. As for the key rice allocation in this city, it will continue to be held in January, and the allocation method will remain the same.

In addition, the certificates for the January ration of rice per capita were sent to the district offices at the end of last year for distribution. And it is scheduled to be issued by January 5th. All those who have registered their household registration in this city in November 37 and have obtained the national identity card of this city should receive the January rice ration certificate. If anyone has not received it within the specified period, they should go to the chief of their jia to collect it before January 8th, and no supplementary issuance will be made after the deadline. Each jia chief should submit the signed list of the jia and the remaining rice certificates to the bao office on January 9th. On the 10th, each bao will prepare a report on the distribution certificate of the bao, together with the remaining certificates and signed list returned by each jia, and submit them to the district office, and then each district office will send them to the allocation office for verification and collection on the 11th. After the citizens receive the rice ration certificate, they should fill in their ID card number, bao, jia, and household number on the certificate. Each rice shop may ask the rice purchaser to show their ID card for verification when rationing rice. In order to facilitate the purchase of rice for citizens, the office has still designated five districts, including Luwan, Songshan, Gaoqiao, Hongkou, and Jiangwan, to handle the rationing of designated rice shops in January. As for the rice rationing last year, it was heard that in several districts, because citizens concentrated on buying from certain rice shops, some rice shops were sold out. The reporter asked the allocation office about any remedies for this yesterday. According to the spokesperson, the office has replenished the few rice shops with a shortage of rice on the 30th and 31st, and as usual, each should be limited to the 31st to stop the rationing, so that each rice shop can close the account and pay the money to the tracking line the next day according to regulations. However, the next day happened to be New Year's Day, and the bank had to open for collection until the 5th. Because of this special situation, citizens who buy rice before January 4th will not affect the rice shop's payment on the morning of the 5th, and they will naturally be happy to accept it, and the rice shop will not refuse.

### Public and Private Teachers Receiving In-Kind Allocations; Must All Present ID Cards

### Observing Industrial Prosperity and Decline from Electricity Consumption: Production Rates Highest in March and April; Autumn Affected by Price Controls

[Our Newspaper] From the figures of industrial electricity consumption, a review of the industrial production of each month in the 37th year reveals that, apart from November when Shanghai Power Company's machinery was continuously damaged, leading to a sharp reduction in electricity supply, the rest generally remained stable. In this city, over 87% of industrial electricity is supplied by the American-owned Shanghai Power Company. Therefore, the company's industrial electricity consumption statistics are sufficient to reflect the general situation of this city's industry. In January last year, the company's industrial electricity consumption was approximately 52 million kilowatt-hours, with 29 million kilowatt-hours used by the textile industry. In February, electricity consumption decreased to 43 million kilowatt-hours, with the textile industry decreasing to 24 million kilowatt-hours. In March, it rebounded to 51 million kilowatt-hours, with 29 million kilowatt-hours used by the textile industry. In April, electricity consumption was 53 million kilowatt-hours, with the textile industry accounting for over 28 million kilowatt-hours. In May, industrial electricity consumption fell back to 48 million kilowatt-hours, with the textile industry accounting for 15 million kilowatt-hours. In June, the electricity consumption figure was slightly less than 50 million kilowatt-hours, with the textile industry around 26 million kilowatt-hours. Furthermore, electricity consumption in July was 48 million kilowatt-hours, in August it was 47 million kilowatt-hours, in September it was 46 million kilowatt-hours, and in October it was 48 million kilowatt-hours, all without significant discrepancies. In November, due to machinery damage at the power plant and massive extraction of electricity, industrial production declined. However, this was an abnormal phenomenon and not due to the shrinking of the industry itself, a point that should not be misunderstood. In December, electricity consumption returned to its previous level, approaching that of October, and may even exceed it. Looking at the industrial consumption of each month throughout the year, April was the highest. According to industry insiders, this period is the peak month for industry because the climate is mild, neither cold nor hot, and workers are in high spirits, resulting in particularly high production rates, hence the higher electricity consumption. September and October in autumn are also normally good months, but this year, due to the harm of rigid price controls, industrial electricity consumption increased.

### Attempted Assassination of Legislator Case Opens: Defendant Confesses Hidden Facts; Paternal Great-Uncle Raped His Wife; Firing to Vent Anger; Plaintiff Claims it was a Pretext for Borrowing Money

[Our Newspaper] Judge Meng Tingke of the District Court opened the trial yesterday afternoon on the case of the attempted assassination of legislator Zhang Erling by a certain grand-nephew Zhang Guangfu, resulting in an order for a retrial on another date. According to the defendant's confession, the inside story is a blood case caused by a love triangle. Zhang Guangfu, of Guangxi origin, brought his wife from Guangxi to Beijing in September last year, living with his paternal great-uncle (currently a Guangxi legislator) Zhang Erling. On November 11th this year, Nanjing was evacuating the population. Guangfu and his wife came to Shanghai, took a boat to Wuhan, and transferred via the Yuehan Railway to return to their Guangxi hometown. On the way to Wuhan, when Guangfu was holding his son while he urinated, his wife was deeply moved and, feeling a pang of conscience, told her husband that she had been repeatedly raped by her great-uncle Erling in February this year. She also wrote a letter to her elder sister (Guangfu's sister-in-law), stating that Erling had asked her to introduce her elder sister to him, to make good things happen, urging her elder sister to be careful and not to follow in her footsteps, falling into Erling's trap. She asked her husband to take the letter to her elder sister in Beijing. Upon hearing this, Guangfu was filled with anger. After sending his wife back to their hometown, he wrote a paper exposing Erling's crimes, which was over six thousand words long. Together with the letter given to him by his wife, he took a train back to Hengyang and, for a price of over ten thousand yuan, bought an airplane ticket and returned to Beijing and Shanghai. On December 5th, Guangfu went to Zhang Erling's home at 1777 Linsen Middle Road in this city, presented the charges and the letter he had brought with him. During their conversation, an argument broke out. Erling's wife, Wu Shuying, heard the noise and came downstairs. Initially, she scolded Erling for his improper behavior, and then the couple began to argue with each other. They then turned their anger on Guangfu. Shuying cursed Guangfu as a "turtle son-of-a-bitch," and demanded that Guangfu leave immediately, or she would kill him. In a fit of anger, Guangfu raised his own pistol and fired four times in a row, injuring Erling in the left armpit. Shuying stepped forward to stop him, and her left wrist was also slightly injured. After reporting to the police, the case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation, and Guangfu was prosecuted for attempted murder. The District Court opened the trial yesterday afternoon and brought up Guangfu, who confessed:

He is 29 years old this year. Erling is his great-uncle outside of the five degrees of mourning. Since the 31st year, he has been helping Erling run the Housheng Company, doing native product business, and serving as a manager, etc., until now. This November, he also assisted Erling in traveling around to do gold bar business, which generated a lot of income. He also said: I sincerely helped him run his business, but he raped my wife, which caused me great pain. Zhang Erling and his wife Shuying both appeared in court to answer questions, denying that there was any rape and claiming that Guangfu was seeking revenge for failing to borrow money. A witness surnamed Tang said that he went to Zhang's house that day for some business and heard arguments about borrowing money in the reception room. The court ordered the collection of evidence after both parties held their own arguments, and rescheduled the retrial to January 10th. The defendant was returned to custody. The court adjourned at 12:40 PM.

### Huili Unexpectedly Out of Form: Air School Achieves Great Victory Last Night; Expeditionary Force to Battle Hualian Tonight

[Our Newspaper] The Air Force Officer School basketball team from Zhenzhou played its third match last night against the strong team Huili in this city. There were over 500 spectators. Huili suffered a crushing defeat with a score of 28 to 50. In the first half, Huili had 12 points and Air School had 30. Air School's performance over the three consecutive nights has shown a rapid improvement. The strength of the team is impressive. The performance of the Air School was particularly good in the first half, with the five players resembling lively dragons and tigers. Zhu, Liao, and Sun stood out. Huili relied solely on Cheng Zhang for scoring, resulting in a disjointed phenomenon. In the second half, Huili's Meng Xiancheng and Wu Chengzhang were injured one after the other, and the formation became more chaotic, resulting in a defeat. Huili's performance last night was unexpectedly out of form, with too many loopholes, allowing Air School to do whatever they wanted. The details of the match are as follows:

The match started at 7:00 PM. After contact, Air School's Liao Xuewen made a free throw. Huili's Shang Chongyue and Air School's Sun Huanting each scored a goal. Soon, Air School took the lead with a score of 5 to 2. Huili desperately counterattacked and tied the score at 7. Wu Chengzhang scored two points to chase the score, but the opponent scored three consecutive goals and remained behind, making the score 13 to 9. Air School's momentum was still strong. Their movements were agile, and they were rampant under the basket, scoring every time they shot, leaving Huili speechless. At 20 to 9, Huili substituted Tian Fuhai for Wang Yongfang, and then the score became 28 to 12. Air School substituted Yuan Shixian for Li Fuming. At half time, Air School had 30 points and Huili had 12, which was unexpected.

After the break, the two teams fought again. Air School substituted Meng Xiancheng for Wei Xu. Wu Chengzhang scored a shot, and Yuan Shixian scored a free throw. Tian Fuhai broke through the basket again, and the situation changed. The official school then stopped. As expected, Liao Xuewen probed in. At this time, the two teams fought fiercely, and Huili's Meng Xiancheng injured his foot and left the field. Shang Chongyue entered to replace him, and the game entered a stalemate. After 36 to 21, the official school saw a smooth opportunity again. Xuewen and Huanting took turns scoring, gaining four consecutive goals, making the score 44 to 21. Huili lost by more than half. When time ran out, Air School defeated Huili with a score of 50 to 28, spreading the good news again.

### Jin Cheng's "Winter Scene"

— Our Newspaper Reporter Song Lin

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 26th Airmail] Since entering winter, Xuzhou has experienced very little snow, and outbreaks of epidemics have been constantly discovered. According to statistics from the Provincial Meteorological Observatory: The amount of snowfall this winter is the least in five years. On the 22nd, the "Winter Solstice," a Siberian cold air mass invaded the country, and the temperature in various places in the upper reaches of the Yellow River dropped sharply. Heavy snow fell in the northwest, and Lanzhou was also filled with goose feathers, turning into a silver world overnight. For four or five days in a row, it was sometimes cloudy and sometimes snowy, resulting in the delay of all flights this week. New students above the junior college level in this city had their winter vacation less than two weeks after entering school. The original plan for middle and primary schools was to start their winter vacation on January 15th of next year, but today, due to the severe cold weather and limited funds for each school, with no winter coal available, they have also successively moved up the exams, and will begin their vacation at the end of this month.

9.9 Degrees Celsius Below Zero

In a climate of 9.9 degrees Celsius below zero, prices are soaring frequently. Coal is selling for 120 yuan per 100 kilograms, but it is still not easy to purchase. The poverty of the common people can be imagined. As for the general poor, they are still provided for by the annual Winter Relief Committee's fundraising and relief efforts. According to a survey of more than a month, there are 8,468 poor households in the city. However, after the final "re-examination," it was decided to target the poor who are "unable to survive without relief," initially reducing the number to 7,926 households, totaling more than 14,000 people. The Winter Relief Committee's fundraising of more than 9,500 yuan, the surplus of 15,176 yuan from the sale of Winter Relief lottery tickets, and the relief funds allocated by the province, totaling more than 30,000 yuan, have been decided to purchase flour and other supplies for distribution by district. The Northeast Volunteer Army and their families, who used to return to their hometowns from the Northwest via Beijing and Shanghai, are now returning to the Northwest one after another, with some planning to go to Xinjiang to live a wandering and difficult life. This time, the city government also raised a sum of money and materials to distribute to them, totaling 5,530 yuan in relief funds and 59 sets of cotton clothes. The work of collecting relief funds for the poor is still being carried out in various ways. Elementary school students have automatically held two days of music concerts to seek a glimmer of warmth for their suffering compatriots.

Grain Collection Team Sweeps Big Households Three Times

Since October, the winter relief work launched throughout the province, according to a spokesperson from the Department of Social Affairs, is estimated to raise 10,000 shi of grain and 100,000 yuan in relief funds throughout the province, exceeding the funds and materials raised in previous years by several times. Some counties have even completed the distribution. It is said that this is because the general public understands the importance of this work and has responded enthusiastically. However, a small number of local tyrants and evil gentry are not only stingy towards this relief work, but also repeatedly resist the payment of land tax, so that the land tax originally scheduled to be collected by the end of this year has not yet reached 90%. Especially in Lanzhou City, the situation is even more special, with only 50% collected so far. In order to complete the task, the city government has recently formed a "Grain Collection Team" to go to various districts to urge payment. Several large households, such as Che Ziquan, Zhang Zihou, and Zhang Nianzu, owe more than ten shi of grain. No matter how many times the "Grain Collection Team" "sweeps" their doors, they passively adopt a "general does not see face" approach, refusing to pay. After receiving the report, the city government has set a deadline for payment, otherwise it will ask the provincial government to severely punish them.

On this night, in several high-class families using Christmas as a pretext, lights were bright, wines were flowing, and the magnificent church bells became their "lullaby."

### Tea Market Transactions Become Quiet

Yesterday's tea market saw transactions decline significantly. Green tea was affected because the Gregorian New Year's Eve had already arrived, and the money market on the market remained tight. Daily interest rates again reached more than 40 yuan per thousand. At the same time, because various financial instruments and commodities consistently fell sharply on the day before, buyers were also pessimistic about red and green tea and were unwilling to rush to buy.

Prices were able to hold steady, and the market situation was no different from before.

### This Year, China's Barter Trade Focuses on the Nanyang Sterling Bloc; Person in Charge of the China Trust Bureau Points Out Three Advantages

According to the China Trust Bureau, the Bureau has learned from past barter trade with countries such as France and Italy that China can export very few types of goods, and the goods obtained through barter are not sufficient for China's needs. Therefore, the target of barter trade for this (38th) year will focus on the Sterling Bloc in the Nanyang region. A spokesperson pointed out that the degree of industrial development in the Nanyang region is not superior to that of China. China's industrial products such as silk textiles and enamel hot water bottles can all be exported. At the same time, industrial raw materials such as cotton and rubber can be imported from the Nanyang region, which will help China's industrial recovery. It is evidenced by the fact that China did not engage in barter trade with the Nanyang Sterling Bloc last year, so various raw materials such as cotton could not be obtained in large quantities. Moreover, foreign trade in various states of the Nanyang Sterling Bloc mostly uses barter as a means. To obtain their materials, it is necessary to exchange. Given China's proximity to Nanyang, once barter trade is launched, its advantages are: (1) There are many overseas Chinese in the Nanyang Sterling Bloc, which greatly helps the promotion of Chinese goods, thereby establishing the position of Chinese goods in Nanyang. (2) Qi, the items most needed by China, are all produced in Nanyang. The types and quantities of Chinese industrial and agricultural products needed in Nanyang are also more numerous than in other countries. In this way, exports can be increased, which is beneficial to both parties. (3) Strengthening trade ties with the Sterling Bloc can alleviate China's lack of US dollar foreign exchange.

### New Year's Panorama

Reflections on New Year's Day in the Past

In ancient times, there were various customs for the New Year. The *Chronicle of the Seasons of Jingchu* states: "On the first day of the first month, young and old all put on their best attire and pay New Year's greetings in order of seniority, offering peppercorn wine and drinking peach soup, and then drinking Tusu wine, chewing dates, and partaking of the five pungent herbs." It also states: "On New Year's Day, pictures of chickens are pasted on doors, Dongsuo ropes are hung above them, and talismans are inserted beside them, which frightens away all ghosts." Nowadays, these old customs are mostly no longer practiced and are only cited as historical facts in poetry and prose.

Turning through the copies of this newspaper from the twelfth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing dynasty, there is a passage that states: "The first day of the first month is New Year's Day, and there are ceremonies such as celebrations and greetings. From the emperor to the common people; from the court to the villages, none are exempt. Although it is impossible to verify before the Xia and Shang dynasties, this custom was already practiced in the Zhou dynasty. From the Han dynasty to today, this custom has been passed down and has not been changed. During the Han dynasty, on New Year's Day, officials at court would offer peppercorn wine to the emperor during New Year's greetings to wish him longevity. Now, there are still New Year's greetings, but without the offering of wine. Inside, princes and high officials offer New Year's greetings in palaces and halls; outside, high-ranking officials of the borders, as well as prefectural and county officials, celebrate each other in their respective jurisdictions. After offering sacrifices to ancestors, common people also drink Tusu wine. Those of lower status first respect those of higher status, and the young first respect the old, drinking in succession until the youngest. Now, there is no longer a custom of drinking Tusu wine in turn, but the ritual of celebrating New Year's Day remains. After family rituals are completed, they visit relatives, friends, colleagues, and neighbors to offer New Year's greetings, which is commonly known as 'paying New Year's respects.' According to Chinese regulations, civil and military officials seal their official seals for one month during the New Year, allowing them to take a break from work. Unless there are urgent matters, everything can be postponed until after the seals are reopened. Sealing the seals is scheduled for the 20th day of the twelfth month, and reopening the seals is scheduled for the 20th day of the first month. There may be minor variations, but the difference is no more than a day or so. After the seals are reopened, officials resume their duties as usual, and the New Year festivities are over."

Remembering the Past with Spring Couplets

Old Spring couplets used to say things like "The New Year ushers in abundant blessings, the auspicious festival is called eternal spring," or "The emperor's virtue is as vast as the universe, the imperial grace is as deep as rain and dew." In the early years of the Republic of China, the couplet "Pursue republican happiness, act as free citizens" was popular. After sixteen years, it became "Overthrow imperialism, abolish unequal treaties."

Writing Auspicious Phrases on Red Paper on New Year's Day

Writing auspicious phrases on red paper on New Year's Day was also an old custom. A strip of red paper would be pasted on the wall in the study, with the eight characters "Write auspicious phrases on New Year's Day, may everything go smoothly" written on it. The characters had to be in regular script, written meticulously, and very proper. This paper would be replaced every New Year's Day, simply to bring good luck.

Lanterns for the Lantern Festival

The lanterns for the Lantern Festival are made of paper, some light yellow and some bright red, with various images painted on them, or with gold characters and gold foil pasted on them, making them very splendid. They are mostly flat and round in shape. These are supposed to be decorations for the Lantern Festival in the middle of the first month, but they are already sold in the market before New Year's Eve. "Lantern Festival" is also written as "Top Scholar," presumably wishing for good fortune. Children welcome these the most. With a slight change in style, they become lion lanterns, rabbit lanterns, and so on, which are the most popular New Year's toys.

The First Solar New Year's Day

Thirty-seven years ago today, Chen Qimei, the head of the Shanghai Military Government, issued a proclamation:

"For the matter of issuing a proclamation: Today (the twelfth day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar), we received an order from President Sun, designating the thirteenth day of this month as Solar New Year's Day. Our Republic of China is undergoing comprehensive reform and should promptly adopt the solar calendar in order to advance civilization alongside the world's great powers, thus refreshing both eyes and ears. Therefore, we hereby proclaim this to the military and the people. Let all military personnel be informed: The thirteenth day of the eleventh month of the 4609th year of the Yellow Emperor's reign is hereby changed to the first day of the first month of the first year of the Republic of China. The lunar calendar, which was previously used, is hereby completely changed. President Sun will assume office and issue orders on New Year's Day of the first year, making a fresh start with the world. This proclamation is hereby urgently issued to inform everyone. Starting tomorrow, all sectors should uniformly hang the national flag to celebrate the grand event. This is a special proclamation!"

The Founding Father's Oath on New Year's Day

At 6:00 PM on New Year's Day of the first year of the Republic of China, the Founding Father arrived at the Marshal's Mansion in a two-horse carriage. He was led into the lounge by the martyr Huang Xing, and then ascended to the presidential office in the grand auditorium. Xu Shaozhen served as the master of ceremonies. The Founding Father swore an oath, which read: "To overthrow the autocratic government of the Manchus, consolidate the Republic of China, and seek democratic happiness, is the public will of the people. I, Wen, will faithfully abide by it and serve the country with utmost loyalty. When the autocratic government has fallen, there is no internal strife, and the Republic of China stands firmly in the world and is recognized by all nations, I, Wen, shall relinquish the position of Provisional President. I hereby swear this to the people. Sun Wen, New Year's Day of the Republic of China."

New Year's Day for Americans

On New Year's Eve, Americans mostly put on fashionable clothes and go out for parades, holding flower paper and throwing it at anyone. Some also bring musical instruments and play them to their hearts' content in the streets. As for those who have girlfriends, they often walk hand in hand, whispering sweet nothings. In big cities, at night, people sing and dance in the streets to welcome the New Year. At midnight, the bells in the churches ring in unison. They make noise until four or five in the morning before returning home, having had their fill of fun.

New Year's Day for the Japanese

On New Year's Day, the Japanese must place two pine trees at the entrance, tied together with bamboo and plum blossoms. The door frame is also made of twisted rice straw, with an orange placed in the middle, and some white paper strips pasted on it, so that demons dare not invade. Before dawn, everyone in the family gets up and climbs to a high place to watch the sunrise, silently wishing for good luck in the year, like the rising sun. After returning home, they stand facing east, and everyone must drink a sip of wine, which is said to ward off evil spirits.

Devil-expelling Rituals

Lamas perform rituals of devil-expulsion during the New Year. Wearing masks in the shape of demons, they sing and dance to the accompaniment of the *Hujia*, its sound mournful, said to drive away evil. The natives of South America also have this custom during the New Year, called the "Gods' Assembly," where participants wear masks and jump and dance for joy. The gods they worship vary in size, the larger ones being up to ten feet tall, and the smaller ones only two or three feet.

New Year's Cards

Since the invention of New Year's cards in 1875, the craze among American women for sending New Year's cards has grown year by year. In 1942, a total of 1.2 billion New Year's cards were sold in the United States, and the postage cost more than 60 million US dollars.
