### He Yingqin Receives Mandate to Form New Cabinet; Acting President Li's Letter to be Submitted to Legislative Yuan Today; Shao Hong Rumored to be Vice President

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] It is learned that Acting President Li has invited He Yingqin to serve as the new Premier of the Executive Yuan. Although He has repeatedly expressed his humility, after careful consideration, he no longer firmly declines. According to sources close to Acting President Li on the evening of the 10th, He has agreed to serve as the new Premier of the Executive Yuan and may fly back to Nanjing from Hangzhou on the 11th or 12th. This was decided in a long-distance telephone call between Nanjing and Hangzhou on the 10th. Barring other changes, Acting President Li's letter nominating the new Premier of the Executive Yuan for approval by the Legislative Yuan is expected to be delivered to the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 11th. Relevant personnel refused to disclose on the evening of the 11th who was nominated in the letter. However, according to general speculation, the nominee is likely He Yingqin.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 10th] Hangzhou experienced rain and wind on the 10th. General He Yingqin quietly resided at Tang Mansion in the West Lake area and did not go out all day. When our reporter visited him to inquire about the formation of the cabinet, he smiled and told the reporter that he was a soldier and did not meddle in politics, and he really dared not take on such a difficult task. Although Acting President Li had called him in Hangzhou, he replied that sending an airplane would also be useless. He also said that he had heard that Acting President Li had sent Gan Jiehou and Qiu Changwei to Hangzhou, but he had not met them yet. He might consider traveling elsewhere recently and would not return to Nanjing for the time being. When discussing the issue of peace and war, he said that after the victory of the War of Resistance, he had devoted himself to international peace work. He had always hoped for domestic peace, but it required both sides to have genuine sincerity. If the fighting continues for a long time, the vitality of the country will be exhausted, and the country will be pushed back several decades. If he needs to participate in the peace work, he is obliged to do so. He was quite fond of Hangzhou. While talking to the reporter, he frequently looked at the scenery of the lake and mountains in the mist outside the window. Xuan Tiewu accompanied him, having been showing He around the famous historical sites in recent days.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The fourth meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held on the morning of the 11th. At that time, proposals will still be discussed in accordance with the agenda. However, if Acting President Li's letter nominating the Premier of the Executive Yuan arrives on the 11th, it will be reported at the plenary session that day and changed to a vote of approval, so as to quickly approve the candidate for the new Premier of the Executive Yuan and facilitate the early formation of the new Executive Yuan. However, as of the evening of the 10th, the Legislative Yuan had not yet received the Presidential Office's letter of nomination.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] An authoritative source spoke to reporters on the evening of the 10th about the procedure for the President to nominate the Premier of the Executive Yuan, saying: "The President's nomination of candidates for Premier of the Executive Yuan and request for the Legislative Yuan's approval is a power granted to the President by the Constitution. However, party politics and parliamentary politics are intertwined. If the nominee is a party member, according to general practice and the Kuomintang's tradition, it should first be proposed and passed in the Central Standing Committee, and then the Legislative Yuan should be consulted for approval. Although the number of KMT Central Standing Committee members in the Nanjing and Shanghai area is sufficient for a quorum, the Central Party Headquarters has already moved to Guangzhou, and the Standing Committee should be held in Guangzhou. Unless consent is first obtained from Guangzhou, the Central Standing Committee should not be held in Nanjing. This time, Premier Sun Ke resigned at a time when the country is facing the most difficult times. In order to prevent government affairs from being interrupted for a long time, Acting President Li may seek the consent of all parties concerned in advance and immediately consult the Legislative Yuan for approval, and then complete the formalities of approval by the Central Standing Committee, so as to be swift. Therefore, if Acting President Li has obtained the consent of the parties concerned, then the move of directly consulting the Legislative Yuan is also an appropriate measure."

[Reuters, Nanjing, 10th] Reliable sources: After General Zhang Zhizhong returned from Xikou today, he will immediately fly to Hangzhou by special plane to urge General He Yingqin to accept the mandate to form a cabinet.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 10th] Reliable sources: It is rumored that Huang Shao-hong has been internally appointed as the Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan, and Qiu Changwei is expected to serve as the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. News this evening indicates that He's appointment as Premier is practically a foregone conclusion.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Li Huang, leader of the Youth Party, arrived in Nanjing by train from Shanghai on the morning of the 10th. At 5:00 pm, he went to Chuanhougang to meet Acting President Li to exchange views on the current situation.

[Our Newspaper] Li Huang traveled by train from Shanghai to Nanjing the night before last at the invitation of Acting President Li to discuss the cabinet formation and peace talks. After the new cabinet is formed, the Youth Party will be invited to participate. It is learned that Li Huang may join the cabinet, but whether he is willing to take on actual responsibilities is still unknown.

### Former Cabinet Leaders Arrive in Shanghai; Immediately Fly to Guangzhou for Handover; Sun Ke to Leave Nanjing in Two or Three Days

[Our Newspaper] Minister of Water Resources Zhong Tianxin, Minister of Industry and Commerce Liu Weizhi, and Minister of Land Administration Wu Shangying arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. They will fly to Guangzhou in a day or two to handle handover matters. Premier Sun will also come to Shanghai and transfer to Guangzhou within two or three days to handle the handover work of the Executive Yuan.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Wu Tiecheng is scheduled to take the night train to Shanghai on the 11th. After staying in Shanghai for one or two days, he will fly from Shanghai to Guangzhou to rush to handle handover matters. Feng Zong'e, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had already taken the night train to Shanghai on the 10th.

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 10th] After the resignation of Sun's cabinet, several legislators here close to Sun said that their arrival in Guangzhou was not at the invitation of Premier Sun, but was notified by Speaker Tong. They were not surprised by the resignation of Sun's cabinet, believing that this was because Sun's cabinet advocated honorable peace and was opposed by others, so resignation was inevitable. A cabinet resigning because its proposals cannot be implemented is the most common thing. As for their current whereabouts, it is said that if the Legislative Yuan decides to move back to Nanjing, the Guangzhou office will move back under orders. Whether colleagues remain in Guangzhou or go to Nanjing is not mandatory under the Constitution, but this is entirely a matter of personal position and has nothing to do with political views. One legislator said that what he is most concerned about is the delay between the resignation of the old cabinet and the formation of the new cabinet, which will cause great losses to the country. There are still more than 60 legislators remaining in Guangzhou.

### Kuomintang Central Standing Committee

Insufficient Number of Members, Change to Discussion Meeting

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th] The Kuomintang Central Standing Committee was originally scheduled to hold its fourth meeting in Guangzhou on the 10th. Due to the insufficient number of Central Standing Committee members remaining in Guangzhou to meet the quorum, it was temporarily changed to a discussion meeting.

### Sun Ke on the Political Situation

Little Hope of Preventing Communist Party Rule; Believes New Cabinet Will Face More Difficulties

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 10th] Former Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sun Ke, in a solo interview with an Associated Press reporter on the 10th, believes that there is little hope of preventing the Communist Party from ruling China through negotiations or war. He warned: "A Communist-ruled China will be linked to the Soviet Union in a global East-West conflict, which is an inevitable result." Sun believes that most of the responsibility for the current situation of the Kuomintang lies in President Chiang's failure to make peace with the Chinese Communist Party when General Marshall came to China for mediation, and in the global "Cold War" between the United States and the Soviet Union. He predicts that the new cabinet, which will be formed soon, will encounter "more difficulties" than his cabinet encountered.

Sun Ke denied that President Chiang, after his retirement, had issued "any formal or direct orders" to any government agency, but admitted that "many former subordinates of President Chiang often consulted him, which was often regarded as orders." Sun also said that he himself had never contacted Chiang by telephone, telegram, or other means. Sun Ke, based on his long experience in the government, said: "The main responsibility for plunging the government into the current situation lies in President Chiang's failure to accept some kind of agreement with the Chinese Communist Party when the War of Resistance had just ended. Even a temporary agreement at that time could have helped rebuild the country's economic and military strength." He added: "Of course, this cannot be entirely blamed on President Chiang; it was also caused by mutual distrust and suspicion. The collapse of the Kuomintang was also due to the Cold War between East and West. The wavering of the United States' policy towards China is also related to this."

"A Communist-controlled China, unless the Communist Party changes its aims, unless the Communist Party knows the benefits of accepting ECA aid, unless they are more Chinese and less Communist, will inevitably join the Soviet bloc. This is a foregone conclusion." He suggested that "to avoid this possibility, the government should insist on strict neutrality in international politics in future peace talks, as well as the freedom of the people's way of life." He believes that these two points are the most important in any future agreement with the Chinese Communist Party. He explained that China has suffered enough in the War of Resistance and the Civil War, "and really cannot bring about another disaster." Sun Ke continued, "The foreign policy of the future coalition government should not involve any future global conflicts that are not directly related to China, such as the German question and the Atlantic Treaty issue." He believes that the Chinese Communist Party is very likely to agree to this in the peace talks.

Regarding the free way of life, Sun Ke continued, "Unless the peaceful resolution contains effective guarantees of democratic rights, especially the right to choose a profession, there will be no satisfactory peaceful resolution." "Of course, some organizations are necessary, but the organization should not be totalitarian."

Commenting on the legislators' launch of a rejection of US aid, Sun said: "This is just a move to please the Chinese Communist Party." He said that without US aid, industry and commerce will be in dire straits, and there will be more unemployed people. He said, "Rejecting US aid will not only bring China to a standstill, but will also put it in a desperate situation." Sun Ke added: "Internal disputes weaken the government's power, and its position is getting worse and worse." He also said that when he resigned, he did not recommend a successor to Acting President Li.

### Chinese Communist Party Comments on Sun's Cabinet Resignation

[Our Newspaper] The Chinese Communist Party's radio station broadcast a Xinhua News Agency commentary yesterday, entitled "Comments on the Resignation of Sun Ke's Cabinet," continuing to fiercely criticize, saying that "Sun Ke's resignation does not mean that the Kuomintang will stop its reaction or reduce its reaction," while also attacking the United States' aid to China, saying that "the Kuomintang reactionaries are relying on the power of US imperialism to seek internal unity." The commentary pointed out that Acting President Li had invited Bai Chongxi, Stuart, and General Barr to a meeting on the 7th, and that Bai Chongxi had obtained Li Zongren's dispatch of representatives to the United States "to establish close contact with American warlords."

### Legislative Yuan's Peace Proposal Completed; To Be Submitted to Today's Plenary Session for Discussion; Acting President Li Calls Shao Lizi for Consultation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] Acting President Li summoned Shao Lizi at 6:00 pm on the 10th to discuss the peace talks issue.

[Our Newspaper] Zhong Tianxin said: Premier Sun has approved his resignation as a peace talk representative, and he believes that Acting President Li will also approve it. Currently, the peace plan has been drafted by a ten-member committee and submitted to Acting President Li. However, procedurally, the plan should first be reviewed by an internal party meeting and approved by the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting before it can be formally submitted as a counterproposal for the peace talks.

[Our City News] Based on the resolution of the General Assembly, the National Peace Promotion Association previously made two major demands and seven proposals to both the government and the Chinese Communist Party.

We accompanied him on traveling and playing in the mountains and rivers for a week, and our faces are tanned.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] According to the military news agency, in order to prevent the Communist army's attempt to cross the Yangtze River, the Naval Headquarters has ordered the Yangtze River Defense Fleet to cooperate closely with the army and air force, and dispatch warships to patrol various ports along the Yangtze River day and night to enhance the river defense.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 10th] Military news: (1) A unit of Communist cavalry arrived west of Yangzhou yesterday. (2) On the 8th, three regiments of a Communist army unit were transferred south along the Taixian Kou-Tai Line, one of which had advanced to the area south of Diaojiapu yesterday. (3) The Communist army is currently collecting horse grass and feed from households in Yangzhou, 150 catties per household. (4) The Communist army is currently supervising the repair of the Yang (Zhou) Yi (Zheng) Highway, and is also mass-assembling wooden rafts on the canal line, building small defensive works on them, and equipping them with motors.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 10th] According to a notice issued by a senior military agency to the troops stationed here, the Fourth, Ninth, and Thirteenth Columns of the Communist army may also be transferred to northern Jiangsu. The military here has not been able to confirm this, but it is firmly believed that the number of Communist army units transferred south is definitely more than the three columns of the Tenth, Eleventh, and Twelfth that have been discovered so far. According to former Nationalist army prisoners, a part of the Communist army in southern Shandong is transferring south towards northern Jiangsu.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 10th] A telegram from Zhenjiang stated that the Nationalist army had withdrawn from the Liuxu bridgehead on the north bank and crossed the river to increase the defense on the south bank. Only some local troops remained to guard Liuxu.

### Principles of Military Reform Have Been Determined

Striving for Streamlined Troops is the Goal Deng Wenyi Says Conscription System Will Not Be AbolISHED

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 10th] The Ministry of National Defense has been discussing the issue of military reform for several days, but has not yet made a final decision. Deng Wenyi, spokesman for the Ministry of National Defense, said on the 10th that four principles of the military reform plan have been determined: (1) Striving for streamlined troops is the biggest goal, and we are going all out; (2) Verifying the number of troops and not allowing any more vacancies; (3) Implementing three public disclosures, namely personnel disclosure, financial disclosure, and opinion disclosure (lower-level cadres and soldiers can express their opinions on the troops); (4) Streamlining senior command agencies and reducing unnecessary ones. Deng said that the conscription system is common in countries around the world, and China cannot abolish it alone. The past conscription system was bad and full of abuses. In the future, it should be improved, and both conscription and recruitment systems should be implemented. The opposition to conscription by local senates is unreasonable and unrealistic.

### Answering Reporters' Questions

When answering reporters' questions, Deng said: (1) The Yangtze River blockade is a blockade against the north bank, and the blockade date will be decided by the local authorities. Yangtze River shipping can still pass. (2) In recent months, 14 local units have withdrawn from the north bank of the Yangtze River to the south bank, as well as some security forces, without adequate funding and poor discipline. They are now being reorganized into seven columns by Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo. (3) There is no way to verify the claim that Lin Biao's troops are moving south on a large scale. (4) It is unknown where the Chongqing ship is now, and the air force has not bombed it. (5) According to unofficial information obtained, the numbers and commanders of the troops under Fu Zuoyi that were reorganized by the Chinese Communist Party in Beiping below the division level have not changed. The units have been transferred away from the vicinity of Beiping and are said to be heading to Chahar and Rehe.

### Communist Troops Cross the Huai River, Attack Luoshan but are Repelled

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 10th] Communist troops in Xiangcheng, Xincai, Zhoujiakou and other places in southeastern Henan have been frequently mobilizing in recent days. A portion of them have already crossed the Huai River in Xixian County and attacked Luoshan. Currently, National Army forces are strengthening their defenses along the Xinyang to Luoshan highway.

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 9th] The vanguard of Liu Bocheng's communist troops, numbering over a thousand, who had advanced to the border of Huangchuan County, forcibly crossed the Huai River on the morning of the 9th and entered Luoshan County. They were met with a counterattack by National Army forces. The communist troops were unable to withstand the assault and fled back to Huangchuan. There are still approximately five communist regiments in Huangchuan County. Furthermore, the communist troops moving south from southeastern Henan continued to enter Runan County from Shenqiu, Xiangcheng, Shangshui, and Xincai on the 9th, with intentions to flee towards Qichun in eastern Hubei. Their goal may be to coordinate with the communist troops in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in their crossing. Currently, the National Army forces in Wuxue, Tianjiazhen, and Qichun in eastern Hubei are strong and well-prepared.

[Our Xinyang Dispatch, 9th] The communist troops have recently been forcibly conscripting soldiers and grain in the Tongbai, Tanghe, and Nanyang areas. Each 保 (bao, unit of administration) is required to provide 140 able-bodied men, 400 dan (unit of weight) of grain, and 1,500 yuan in cash. This has caused unbearable hardship for the people in the fifteen counties of southwestern Henan, who have spontaneously organized Red Spear Societies to resist. Within a week, their numbers have increased from 5,000 to over 70,000, creating a formidable force. In addition to a portion that has already attacked Tongbai County, another group of four to five thousand have advanced to the border of Biyang County, and the county seat may also be captured.

### Editorial: Expedite a Solution to the Xiangxi Incident

While the communist troops are massing on the banks of the Yangtze River, and the entire nation's attention is focused on the political situation in the Jiangnan region, a major incident has suddenly occurred in Xiangxi, south of the Yangtze River, and is still spreading and expanding. The Hunan Provincial Assembly has been meeting for days to discuss countermeasures to the Xiangxi incident, urging local authorities to be vigilant and not underestimate it as a local matter, neglecting defenses. General Cheng Qian, Pacification Director of Changsha and Chairman of Hunan Province, is currently detained in Nanjing due to important official business. The Provincial Assembly has sent a telegram urging him to return quickly to maintain order. General Li Mo'an, military leader of Xiangxi, is also detained in Changsha and has not returned. The Provincial Assembly has also urged him to return to his defense area to take responsibility for resolving the situation, to prevent it from escalating. It is also heard that people from Hunan residing in Nanjing and Shanghai are placing great importance on the Xiangxi incident and have been holding gatherings, believing the area of the rebellion is expanding and the situation is serious. They have been urging Acting President Li and Director Cheng to pay attention to it and quickly devise solutions, so as not to nurture a festering sore that leads to an irreparable situation.

This Xiangxi incident is an armed rebellion that has combined bandits, security forces, and local people. It began in the latter part of last month and has, to this day, successively disrupted the county seats of Yongshun, Baojing, Longshan, Mayang, Chenxi, Yuanling, and other counties. The rebel forces are further threatening Qiancheng to the west, pressing Zhijiang to the south, pointing to Shupu to the east, and heading north towards Changde, an important town in western Hunan. They have also declared that they will temporarily halt military actions after attacking Changde, demonstrating that the rebels' actions are purposeful and planned. The causes of the Xiangxi incident are very complex. In the long term, it is due to the lack of restoration in Xiangxi after the war, the poverty of the people, the exhaustion of resources, and the failure to provide relief, coupled with the rampant corruption of local officials who exploited the good people. In the current chaotic situation, all these problems have finally erupted and become unmanageable. In the short term, it is due to the recent urgent recruitment of soldiers and expansion of the army in Hunan, and the province's desire to reorganize the security teams and police, leading to instability among the teams and police. It is also rumored that General Li Mo'an, Pacification Commander, did not handle the situation appropriately, resorting to military force to suppress and encircle the good people, thereby exacerbating the situation. At the beginning of the incident, the provincial government decided to implement both suppression and appeasement, but in practice, emphasized suppression. The Provincial Assembly recognized the incident was not strongly political in nature and unanimously advocated guidance, even sending representatives with the provincial government to Yuanling to negotiate with the rebel leaders, hoping for unity among the people of Hunan and resolving all local issues through political means. However, the negotiations in Yuanling failed, and a great fire broke out in the city, reducing half of its essence to ashes! The reason for the breakdown of negotiations, according to the "Xiangxi People's Anti-Oppression Committee" in a telegram to Tang Boqiu, Speaker of the Provincial Assembly, and Senator He Sanwei, was that Li Mo'an "instigated his special service regiment to enter Chenling, resisting our army on the one hand, and looting Yuanling on the other, which was a tragic sight. We implore you to request Chairman Cheng to detain him." It is also heard that the rebels in Yuanling put forward three conditions: (1) Replace Li Mo'an, (2) Self-determination for the people of Xiangxi, and (3) Establishment of two divisions in Xiangxi. The attitude of General Li Mo'an, who is detained in Changsha, also emphasizes a political solution and denies oppressing the people of Xiangxi.

Based on the above, we believe that the Xiangxi incident, up to now, does not have a strong political color and can be seen as an event of conflicting interests between local officials and the people. The creation of this incident is of course due to the lack of political clarity, poor human planning, and the people being forced to rebel. If the true nature of the event is indeed as such, without other political factors permeating it, this event may be resolved soon. However, if the authorities only know how to delay and evade, then long nights lead to many dreams, and there is no guarantee that the rebellion will not expand. If it spreads from Xiangxi to the entire Hunan province, and from the border of Hunan to the southwest, then it will be unmanageable. This is what we must particularly raise awareness of today!

As is well known, Hunan's position south of the Yangtze River today is very important. Gu Zuyu said in "Record of Historical Geography": "Huguang is located in the center of eight provinces, the most closed and expansive, with mountains and rivers that are dangerously solid, and has been called Xiongwu since ancient times. To cross Guangdong, one relies on Chenzhou and Yongzhou; to defend Yunnan and Guizhou, one relies heavily on Changde and Yuanling." Defending Hunan secures the southeast; securing Hunan strengthens the southwest. The situation of our country's eight-year war of resistance against Japan fully proves the importance of Hunan's position. Hunan is truly the arm and finger of the east, west, and south. When discussing Hunan's strategic importance, one must especially value Xiangxi. Xiangxi borders Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi, with overlapping mountains and hills, and a mixture of Miao and Yao peoples. It has been a difficult area to govern since ancient times. During the war of resistance, Xiangxi alone resisted the Japanese invaders, blocking them from crossing into Guizhou and Sichuan. This demonstrates that Xiangxi's situation allows it to defend and protect itself. The foundation for the victory of the War of Resistance can almost be said to have been laid in Xiangxi. The wartime provincial government was established in Yuanling, and the surrender ceremony in Zhijiang, where the National Army advanced directly from Xiangxi to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, further illustrates the importance of Xiangxi's position. How can it be ignored? Unfortunately, this incident occurred in Xiangxi, the base of the war of resistance, and is spreading and expanding daily. It is something that should be paid attention to.

In order to rescue Xiangxi and resolve the Xiangxi incident, we strongly agree with the Hunan Provincial Assembly's proposal to handle local events in a guiding manner, to achieve a peaceful resolution quickly, to cut the Gordian knot, to calm the people, and not to procrastinate and delay! Director Cheng is responsible for the safety of Hunan. He should return to Hunan to maintain order as soon as possible, and with great wisdom and courage, peacefully handle the Xiangxi incident and thoroughly eliminate the factors that led to its outbreak. The central government's major plan for peace talks is being led by Acting President Li, and there is no need to stay in the capital any longer. If Director Cheng can resolve the Xiangxi incident in a very short period of time, it will help the peace talks and benefit the country. Otherwise, if the situation expands, it will not only be unfortunate for Hunan, but also not a blessing for the country. We hope the authorities in Hunan pay attention to this!

### The Xiangxi Incident Takes a Sharp Turn: Rebels Withdraw from Yuanling to Await Reorganization, Cheng Qian Scheduled to Return to Hunan Today to Oversee the Situation

[Our Changsha Dispatch, 10th] The Xiangxi incident has taken a sharp turn. Cao Zhenya's rebel forces in Yuanling have accepted the government's orders and withdrew from Yuanling City at 4 p.m. on the 9th. They will first concentrate in Yongshun to await inspection and reorganization into the 5th Security Brigade. Wang Yuanhua will serve as brigade commander, and Cao Zhenya as deputy. Wang will also serve concurrently as the commander for the suppression of Yongshun and Longshan, while Cao will concurrently serve as the commander of the 1st Regiment. Zhang Dazhi and Zhang Yulin, leaders of the rebels who captured Chenxi, will also be appointed as the 2nd and 3rd Regiment commanders of Wang's brigade, respectively. Furthermore, according to official sources, Zhu's battalion of Wang Yuanhua's 10th Security Regiment, stationed in Dayong, never acted recklessly. The government will commend them. Zhang's battalion, although involved in the rebellion and stationed in Chenxi, has also expressed its allegiance and is awaiting government orders.

### Tang Enbo Hosts Publishing Industry, Hopes for Six Principles of Speech, The Peace Talks Issue Should Be Based on Non-Violation of Equality, To Assist Cultural and Educational Work Decides to Establish Cultural and Educational Committee

[Our Report] General Tang Enbo, Commander of the Garrison in Nanjing, Shanghai and Hangzhou, held a tea party at the New Life Club yesterday afternoon to host people from the publishing, cultural, and news circles in this city. He announced the six principles he hopes for regarding various newspaper and periodical opinions: (1) In the future, newspaper articles on the issue of peace talks should be based on the principle of peace that does not violate comprehensive equality and is reasonable. (2) Preparing for war while seeking peace is the established national policy of the government. No newspaper article may publish words that slander, satirize, or violate this national policy. (3) Speech should be accurate and fair, and should not undermine unity, provoke discord, create division, or harm the country. (4) News reports should be based on facts and should not fabricate something out of nothing, spread rumors, or mislead the public. Various telegrams and communications must be carefully published and used with discretion. (5) It is strictly forbidden to leak military secrets and disseminate propaganda that insults the government. (6) Newspapers and periodicals should jointly encourage and assist in maintaining治安 (zhian, public order) in this area, protecting social order, and promoting military-civilian cooperation.

Reactionary Speech and Actions Will Be Severely Sanctioned

Tang pointed out that public opinion on the issue of war and peace is currently very inconsistent. Some people advocate seeking peace without war, believing that preparing for war is an obstacle to peace, demanding that the government cancel conscription and grain requisition, and reject American aid. However, preparing for war while seeking peace, and building strength to seek equal peace, is the established national policy of the government. Everyone has equal rights and freedom, and there is no reason to give them up and be dominated by others. Seeking peace without war is surrender, that is, being dominated by others. Currently, it is very difficult for the communist party to cross the Yangtze River militarily, so they are launching a "political," "economic," and "organizational" crossing first. Those who advocate seeking peace without war are unwittingly falling into the communist party's conspiracy and helping the communist party. Such reactionary speech and actions will be severely sanctioned. Tang also said that although the government is currently suffering setbacks, it is not absolutely without a solution. The struggle with the communist party is part of an international issue. From all aspects, we still have a bright future. He hopes that opinion leaders will help fight for equal freedom and peace. In addition, all speech should have its limits. All reporters, both Chinese and foreign, should abide by them and not make reports that are detrimental to the country and the local area. Foreign reporters can be forgiven because they do not understand our national conditions, but it is hoped that they will be particularly cautious when reporting. In order to assist the cultural and educational work in Nanjing, Shanghai and Hangzhou in the future, this headquarters has decided to establish a Cultural and Educational Committee, which will be headed by Fang Zhi, Director of the City Party Department. It is hoped that all parties will cooperate with it.

War Cannot Be Fought by One Side Alone, Peace Cannot Be Made by One Side Alone

More than a hundred people from the publishing and cultural circles attended the reception yesterday, including Pan Gongzhan, Cheng Cangbo, Yan Duhe, Fan Zhengbo, Fang Zhi, and Cao Jun. Before Commander Tang gave the above speech, Cheng Cangbo, Pan Gongzhan, and Fan Zhengbo spoke successively, and Fan Xuejun performed a 彈唱 (tanchang, ballad singing with plucked string instrument) to add to the enjoyment. Cheng Cangbo had just returned from the capital and reported that the capital's current situation had stabilized much more. Pan Gongzhan vehemently criticized those who opposed preparing for war and seeking peace, pointing out that war cannot be fought by one side alone, and peace cannot be made by one side alone. He advocated that the city defense works in this city should still be completed as quickly as possible before a secure guarantee of peace is obtained, rather be prepared and not use it. Pan also expressed his deep disgust with the distorted reporting of a few foreign reporters, especially regarding the various rumors after President Chiang's retirement, which were particularly unreasonable. Therefore, he advocated that foreign reporters should be equally restricted and not exceed the limits. Fan Zhengbo hoped that receptions could be held frequently in the future so that everyone could exchange ideas together. Tang immediately accepted this suggestion. The tea party did not break up until around 5 p.m.

### Subsidies for Provinces and Cities: Ministry of Finance Approves Advance Allocation

### Expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Area: Decision to Enlist Italy, Portugal, and Denmark; Five Western European Countries Met in London Yesterday; Final Review of the Treaty Draft

[Our Newspaper] Washington, 10th, Radio Broadcast: According to reliable sources, the date and location for signing the North Atlantic Treaty will be decided at tomorrow's meeting. The Danish Foreign Minister will visit Acheson tomorrow but may not attend the meeting. The full text of the draft will be submitted to the Italian government for review after the meeting. It is widely believed that the Danish government will approve the treaty's provisions by the middle of next week, but the attitudes of Iceland and Portugal remain unknown.

[United Press, London, 10th] Authoritative sources stated on the 10th that the British Cabinet has approved the Atlantic Treaty draft in principle, and formal approval is merely a formality. European foreign ministers are expected to travel to Washington at the end of this month for the signing ceremony, which coincides with the opening date of the second half of the current session of the United Nations General Assembly at Lake Success.

[United Press, Washington, 10th] The Atlantic Treaty draft stipulates that if any signatory's ships, aircraft, or territory within the security zone are attacked, the signatories will take collective action. This point was revealed by authoritative sources on the 10th as the eight countries drafting the treaty await Italy, Portugal, Denmark, and Iceland to join the treaty. It is said that the procedures for enlisting these countries will be the same as those for Norway. An invitation will be issued immediately upon receiving a formal request to join. The decision to welcome Italy as a fundamental signatory to the treaty came as a surprise. Britain and France advocated for Italy's inclusion, while other countries were lukewarm.

[Reuters, London, 10th] After receiving the full text of the Atlantic Treaty draft from Washington yesterday, the British Foreign Office convened a full Cabinet meeting today to discuss it. Diplomatic circles expect the British Cabinet's approval to be virtually certain. If the seven governments of the treaty—the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Canada—approve the full text of the draft before next Tuesday, the full text of the treaty is expected to be released next Wednesday. London believes that this historic treaty can be formally signed in Washington on April 5. Representatives of the five Western European Union countries gathered in London this morning to discuss the ratification of the treaty. The British Foreign Office issued a statement saying that the representatives of the five countries will meet again in London on Monday to conduct a final review of the treaty's contents. After the review, the final signing ceremony can be held in Washington. The convening of this London meeting is to resolve minor differences among the five countries regarding the treaty. At the same time, the five Western European Union countries have invited Italy, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, and Ireland to send observers to the meeting of the five Western European Union countries to be held in London on Monday. Diplomatic circles attach great importance to this meeting, as its success would mean Europe's approval of the Atlantic Treaty. As the treaty has undergone lengthy discussions in Washington, it is expected that this London meeting will be swift and smooth.

### Opening of the Supreme Soviet Council: Stalin Personally Present from the Dais; Cabinet Restructuring to Strengthen Ties with Satellite States

[Reuters, Moscow, 10th] The first meeting of the Supreme Soviet Council of the Soviet Union since 1946 grandly opened this morning at the Kremlin. More than a thousand representatives from various Soviet republics attended. The session is expected to last at least four or five days. Due to the tense international situation, this session has attracted considerable attention.

[Our Newspaper] Washington, 10th, Radio Broadcast from Moscow: Stalin and Molotov personally attended. The audience responded with enthusiastic applause as the two entered the hall. The meeting will present the defense budget and economic measures.

[Reuters, Warsaw, 9th] According to information received by political figures here, the Soviet Union's key defense cabinet has been reorganized under the direct command of former Foreign Minister Molotov. Molotov's responsibility is to ensure long-term connections between the Soviet Union and its Eastern European neighbors in terms of industry and armaments. This action by the Soviet Union demonstrates its deep shock and unease at the progress of the Marshall Plan and the recent active progress of the Atlantic Treaty. It is generally expected that the first task of the reorganized Soviet defense cabinet will be to convene a meeting of military leaders and their political and intelligence advisors from Eastern and Central European countries. It is rumored that the meeting will be held in Hungary soon. Some believe that the next step will be to recall Soviet ambassadors stationed in its satellite states to inform them of the actions the Soviet Union plans to take to counter the expansion of Western powers in Scandinavia. At the same time, they will instruct each satellite state to increase electricity production.

### Ireland Does Not Intend to Join the Treaty Until Unification is Complete

[Reuters, Dublin, 9th] Irish Prime Minister Costello told this agency today that we have previously stated that we will not participate in the Atlantic Treaty unless our national unification is restored. This position remains unchanged. In any defense plan of Western democracies, Ireland is a natural outpost on the Atlantic coast, but Ireland must be a unified country, with the six counties of the north returning to Ireland's embrace. Otherwise, Ireland cannot accept the constraints of the Atlantic Treaty.

### US Arms Aid to Foreign Countries Bill: Being Drafted; Whether China and Korea are Included is Undetermined

Recipient countries include Western European countries, Iran, Greece, Turkey, the Philippines, and Latin America. Whether China and Korea are also included in the list of recipients is currently unknown. The bill will be submitted to Congress in early April.

Gubichev was arrested for allegedly engaging in espionage activities using his diplomatic privileges. Acheson's decision was announced by the State Department after a 20-minute meeting with Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin.

### Philippine Representative Romulo Criticizes the Netherlands: Violating Security Council Resolutions; Demands That All Countries Pay Attention to the Consequences of the Hague Conference

[Our Newspaper] New York, 10th, Radio Broadcast: Lake Success Dispatch: Philippine Representative Romulo issued a warning while the Security Council was discussing the Indonesian issue, requesting that all countries pay attention to the consequences of the round table conference convened by the Netherlands in The Hague. Romulo stated that although the round table conference is a new tactic by the Dutch side, the Netherlands' aim remains consistent: to disregard the Security Council's resolutions, to negotiate peacefully if possible, and to resort to war when necessary, doing as they please and disregarding good faith.

Romulo stated: Six weeks ago, the Dutch representative made a sacred promise to this council, saying that Indonesian leaders would be released immediately, but they subsequently went back on their word. The President and Prime Minister of Indonesia are still detained on Bangka Island.

### The Netherlands Publicly Denies: The Claim of Restoring the Indonesian Government

Rumors that Britain is Applying Pressure to the Netherlands

[United Press, Lake Success, 10th] Dutch Chief Representative to the United Nations Van Dongen declared today that the Dutch government believes it cannot comply with the Security Council's instructions to restore the Indonesian Republic's leaders to power. He will explain this matter at the Security Council meeting this afternoon. He firmly believes that if Indonesian leaders are released, they will immediately seize the opportunity to launch sabotage and intensify guerrilla warfare. Although the Netherlands hopes for the independence of all of Indonesia, it does not want this independence to be as chaotic as that of Burma. There is no basis to the rumor that the Dutch side has allowed Indonesian leaders to return to Yogyakarta. He spoke by phone with his Foreign Minister Steik last night, confirming that the government's position has not changed.

[Reuters, New York, 10th] The New York Times reported that the British government is pressuring the Dutch government through its diplomatic representatives to make concessions so that the Indonesian Republic can attend the Dutch-Indonesian round table conference in The Hague. The concession that Britain suggested to the Netherlands is to allow the Indonesian Republic to return to its capital, Yogyakarta.

### Soviet Union Pressures Turkey: Demands a Statement on its Attitude Towards the Western Alliance; British Chief of Staff Inspects Middle East Defenses

[United Press, London, 9th] According to reports on the 9th, the Soviet Union's focus in the East-West Cold War has temporarily shifted to the Eastern Mediterranean. According to dispatches from Istanbul, the Soviet government has requested the Turkish government to state its attitude towards the proposed North Atlantic Treaty and the Mediterranean Treaty that may be linked to it. This is the second time in two years that the Soviet Union has exerted pressure on Turkey, demanding a greater say in controlling the Dardanelles Strait.

[Reuters, London, 9th] Foreign Minister Bevin recently answered a question from a Member of Parliament in writing, stating that no steps are currently being taken to organize an Eastern Mediterranean treaty that would complement the Atlantic Treaty.

[Reuters, Athens, 9th] British Imperial Chief of Staff Marshal Slim arrived here by plane today for a two-day stay. He is inspecting defenses in the Middle East.

### Washington Rumors that Within Six to Nine Months: MacArthur Will Retire from Japan; The Military Control System in Japan Will Be Changed to a Civilian System

[United Press, Washington, 9th] According to authoritative sources on the 9th, the United States plans to place Japan under civilian control within six to nine months, no longer under military control, and to reduce the troops stationed in Japan from an administrative nature to a garrison force. Top-level officials believe that this action will be issued simultaneously with MacArthur's retirement. The source emphasized that changing military control to civilian control under the State Department does not mean that US troops stationed in Japan will be reduced. On the contrary, the strength of US troops stationed in Japan will be increased by 20,000 this year. When the State Department takes over the military control from the Department of the Army, US troops stationed in Japan will relinquish administrative duties and focus on garrison activities, similar to the situation of US troops in the Philippines before the war. At that time, the United States maintained a powerful army in the Philippines, under the control of a civilian governor. The strength of some of the increased troops stationed in Japan will be drawn from South Korea. Currently, there are 7,500 US troops in South Korea, who are there at the request of the new South Korean government to maintain order. It is generally believed that US troops stationed in Korea will be transferred to Japan this year. Well-informed sources said that due to the resignation of Under Secretary of the Army Draper and Secretary of the Army Royal's brewing resignation, it is easier to achieve the change of military control in Japan to civilian control. This change has been brewing here for a long time but was opposed by Draper and Royal and was not implemented.

### Allied Headquarters Spokesperson: Denies the Change of System

MacArthur Refuses to Answer Questions on This Matter

[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] Allied Headquarters Official Spokesperson, News Bureau Chief Eichel, stated on the evening of the 10th that the news that Japan is about to transition from military control to civilian control is "pure speculation." Eichel stated that as far as the occupation army officials here are concerned, there is no fact to support the claim from Washington that occupation affairs will be transferred to civilians, and the army will only be placed in a garrison position. He said: "If there is such a thing, we would be happy to disclose it, as this matter is of general interest." At the same time, he said that such news should be considered "purely speculative." He said that MacArthur would not answer individual inquiries on this broad issue. United Press had requested MacArthur to explain in writing on the morning of the 10th.

### South Korea's Admission to the United Nations: Initially Approved

[United Press, Rangoon, 9th] Officials announced today that Karen rebels have occupied the Anisakhan airfield, seven miles south of Maymyo.

It is also learned that Communist troops are advancing from the Irrawaddy Delta towards Insein, ten miles north of Rangoon, to assist the Karen people in battle.

[United Press, Rangoon, 10th] Karen rebels have occupied the town of Maymyo in central Burma after fierce street fighting with government troops.

### Israeli-Jordanian Negotiations to Demarcate Borders: A Certain Country Attempts to Fish in Troubled Waters; Disputes over the Red Sea Port Create an Atmosphere of Chaos

[United Press, Rhodes Island, 9th] Israel and Jordan held their first ceasefire meeting today to discuss demarcating the borders between the two countries, focusing especially on the Jerusalem and Latrun areas.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 10th] The Israeli Foreign Minister's representative in France issued a communique today, specifically pointing out that certain parties are attempting to create chaos in Aqaba to fish in troubled waters.

### German Atomic Expert Heisenberg Announces: The Soviet Union is Manufacturing Atomic Bombs; There May Also Be Important Discoveries in Death Rays

[United Press, Göttingen, Germany, 9th] A German atomic expert said on the 9th that he is "almost certain" that the Soviet Union is manufacturing atomic bombs in a remote Siberian industrial center. Professor Heisenberg, a Nobel laureate and director of the wartime German Atomic Research Institute, said that Soviet scientists may have made "dangerous discoveries" in the field of "death rays."

Heisenberg said that information leaked from the Iron Curtain supports the belief that the Soviet Union is manufacturing atomic weapons in the special industrial centers of Atomgrad and Oozita, located southwest of Irkutsk, the capital of Siberia, and east of the Ural Mountains. The German scientist said that Soviet atomic research is "very secret," but information leaked from Eastern Europe is enough to make him believe that the Soviet Union has succeeded in manufacturing atomic weapons. Heisenberg did not describe the death ray that he said the Soviet Union is researching, but said that there is existing evidence that Soviet researchers have reached the "initial stages" of developing such weapons. He said that at present, death rays may not have been developed to the point of military value, but insisted that the Soviet Union's discoveries are very "dangerous" in the future.

### Relations Between Cuba and the Soviet Union: Hanging by a Thread

[United Press, Havana, 10th] Cuba appears to be preparing to sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The State Department yesterday released excerpts from two notes to the Soviet Union, which were worded very strongly. One of the notes rejected Soviet protests about the use of masks resembling Stalin's face during the celebration of the Catholic Carnival here. The other note denounced the Communist Party for inciting unrest in Western democratic countries.

[United Press, Amman, 9th] The Jordanian Ministry of Defense announced tonight that Israeli troops advanced towards Aqaba Bay and were intercepted by Jordanian troops 50 kilometers from the area, resulting in a fierce battle. Details are unknown. At the same time, British officials in London acknowledged that the situation in Aqaba is serious. However, an Israeli military spokesman in Tel Aviv declared that Israeli troops are only occupying all of their own territory. Aqaba is the common Red Sea outlet for Israel and Jordan. Last autumn, British troops, in accordance with the Anglo-Jordanian joint defense agreement and at the request of the King of Jordan, entered the port, and Israel protested to the Security Council about this matter. How this port should be handled will be determined by the ceasefire negotiations currently being held in Rhodes by Israel and Jordan.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 9th] An Israeli spokesperson solemnly denied today the rumors that Israeli troops are operating in Jordanian territory. The statement said that Israeli land and air forces have never operated outside of Israel and have absolutely no intention of invading Jordanian territory. On the contrary, reports from Amman indicate that Jordanian troops have established positions on Israeli territory. Therefore, if a conflict occurs, Jordan should bear full responsibility. According to United Nations officials, they are not aware of any renewed fighting in Palestine.

### The Soviet Union May Have Acquired the Secrets of Death Liquid

[Reuters, Mountain View, California, 10th] US Army Engineer Major Graham said in a speech here today that the Soviet Union is very likely to have acquired the secrets of the Nazi-invented liquid death spray, which is capable of wiping out an entire division in an open field. Because the effects of using this spray are difficult to eliminate for a very long time, the Nazis never formally tested it, and it is expected that the Soviet Union will not dare to use it at present.

The award recipients were all underground personnel from our country who contributed during the War of Resistance, including Sa Benju, Fan Chunsheng (received by his wife Xiang Moying), Jiang Zhuqing, and Fang Shoucheng. All four individuals, during the War of Resistance, risked danger and difficulty to find ways to help British and American expatriates escape from enemy-occupied areas, and were themselves arrested by the Japanese as a result, suffering severe torture. Fan Chunsheng even sacrificed his life for it. The British government, grateful for the righteousness and bravery of the four gentlemen, believes that they made outstanding contributions to the Allied victory, and therefore specially awarded them certificates and medals to commend them. Among the four, Sa Benju was the protagonist of the first "War of Resistance Wife" case in this city, and is already well-known to Shanghai society. Mr. Sa currently works in Taiwan and made a special trip to Shanghai for the ceremony.

Mr. Fan and Mr. Jiang risked their lives to escort Major Ente and six others to the interior.

One recipient of a medal: (4) Mr. Fang Shoucheng, who served as the head of Chinese personnel at the British Army Headquarters in China, diligently fulfilled his duties for the British Army's war efforts in China and made meritorious contributions, and was specially awarded the Order of the British Empire (Civil Division).

### Salaries of National School Teachers and Staff; Strongly Request Issuance According to Index; Also Request Supplementary Payment for February Salaries

[Report from Our Newspaper] The salaries of teachers and staff in national universities and colleges in this city have been paid on a temporary basis after the principals went to Beijing to petition and received funds, and after verbal agreement from Deputy Minister Chen, provisionally at 500 times the original salary. The Ministry of Education recently sent a telegram, believing that it should still be issued according to the government's regulations, i.e., the March salary should be prepaid at three times the standard of the February salary (i.e., 225 times), and more will be refunded and less will be supplemented after the government approves the adjustment plan at the end of the month. The principals still request that the salary be calculated according to the local cost of living index, believing that after the cost of living index for March is released, the Ministry of Education should supplement the amount that is insufficient in addition to the 500 times that has already been issued, and also request supplementary payment for the February salary. They believe that it is not excessive to pay university professors according to the cost of living index. The National University Professors' Association also expressed dissatisfaction with the government's method of adjusting the treatment of public school personnel and insisted on issuing salaries according to the original salary multiplied by the cost of living index without deduction. They are now waiting for the measures taken after the new cabinet is formed.

### Students of Seven Universities in a State of Starvation; Joint Telegram to Acting President Li; Requesting Permission for Full Public Funding

[Report from Our Newspaper] Self-funded and semi-self-funded students in national universities and colleges in this city have recently been unable to pay for meals due to soaring prices, and have been requesting full public funding. Yesterday, all self-funded and semi-self-funded students from seven schools, including Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Tongji University, Jinan University, the Conservatory of Music, Shanghai Business College, and Tangshan Institute of Technology, jointly sent a telegram to Acting President Li, stating that they are now in a state of starvation and earnestly requesting that the public funds allocated for North China be transferred to schools in Shanghai for full public funding to relieve their suffering. In addition, they also published a statement to the community for striving for full public funding, stating: "The threat to our lives has made it impossible for us self-funded and semi-self-funded students to afford food, and we are about to face starvation. In the past, for the sake of life and studies, we borrowed and pawned everywhere, we were home tutors, we reclaimed wasteland, held auctions, and shined shoes to barely make it through month after month. In a state of semi-starvation, anemia and lung disease are attacking us. However, even this kind of life is now at its wit's end, and we are unable to bear it." They pointed out that the reason for this is the high-speed inflation, and gave an example: "A student's family sold one shi of rice in the countryside, but after two weeks of transfer, it was only worth one dou of rice when it arrived. Another student was a home tutor and had an income of seven dou of rice at 8/19, but now it is only enough to pay for the fare denominated in Guan Yuan. These are all for students who are relatively resourceful, and it is even more conceivable for those who have no relatives or whose families are affected by the war and rely entirely on selling things to pay for food." For this reason, they are striving for full public funding to solve the "most basic survival problem" and expressed "We will not rest until our goal is achieved."

### Public Utilities Request Loans, Amounting to Over 4 Million US Dollars; National Bank Unable to Bear the Burden, Discussion Today to Approve Reductions

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Municipal Council's Public Utilities Subcommittee, considering the monthly cost statements submitted by various public utilities companies in the city to be excessively large, totaling US$4,572,245.41, requested the Council's Petition Representatives to consult with the city government authorities and the Central Bank for preliminary discussions. These were not accepted. Therefore, a special subcommittee meeting was convened yesterday at 3:00 PM at the Municipal Council to discuss two proposals. Resolutions were made as follows: A. How to determine the amount of working capital to be borrowed from the Central Bank for each public utilities company. Resolution: (1) The minimum necessary working capital required by each public utilities company each month, in addition to the companies' best efforts to raise their own funds, will be determined by the Public Utilities Bureau after detailed review of each company's inventory levels and actual labor needs, and negotiations will be conducted with the Central Bank to secure the loan. (2) When the Public Utilities Bureau reviews the amount of loans for each company, representatives from this committee's base review and representatives from the Central Bank will jointly participate. A review meeting will be held at the Public Utilities Bureau at 10:00 AM today. The review of loans will be based on the following three data points: 1. The inventory of major production and maintenance materials for each company as of March 10. 2. The monthly required amount of production or maintenance materials. 3. The existing cash amount and total February payroll base of the public transportation company as of March 9. (3) When requesting a loan from the Central Bank, the petition representatives of this committee will consult with the Mayor and the Director of the Public Utilities Bureau. Negotiations with the Central Bank will commence today at 3:00 PM.

Valuation Base Undecided; Review Continues Today

B. How to determine the valuation base for reviewing each public utilities company. Resolution: (1) The six representatives previously designated for the base review are requested to continue working with the Public Utilities Bureau starting at 10:00 AM today to expedite the review process. (2) The dividend item in the expenses listed by each company will be temporarily excluded.

Those who attended the subcommittee meeting yesterday included Pan Gongzhan, Jiang Hao, Wang Zhuyi, Jiang Haoran, Zhang Zhongyuan, Shi Zongde, Wang Naixu, Li Wenjie, Ma Junshuo, etc. Mayor Wu Guozhen, Central Bank representative Chen Yanzuo, and Public Utilities Bureau Director and Deputy Director Zhao Zengjue and Zhang Rentao were present. Chaired by Jiang Hao, Jiang Haoran first reported on the review of each company's accounts from the previous day, noting that the unit base could not be determined and would continue to be studied today.

Wang Zhuyi Reports on Loan Negotiation Process

Wang Zhuyi then reported on the process of negotiating the loan at the Central Bank yesterday morning, stating briefly: Today, those who went to the Central Bank to request the loan included Mayor Wu, Council Speaker Pan, Deputy Council Speaker Xu, Secretary-General Xiang, and Councilors Zhang Zhongyuan, Jiang Hao, and Ma Junshuo, as well as Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue. Liu Gongyun and Lin Chongyong were also present at the bank. The representatives stated that the Council felt deeply challenged between considering the burden on citizens and maintaining public utilities. Speaking for the people is the Council's duty. Everyone felt that the only way out was to request a loan from the Central Bank, so that on the one hand, public utilities could be maintained and, on the other hand, public support could be secured. They hoped the Central Bank would definitely provide assistance. President Liu and Director Lin both indicated that loans could be granted in principle, but such a large US dollar figure, equivalent to nearly 30 billion Gold Yuan, was equal to one-third of the Gold Yuan issuance amount, which the Central Bank absolutely could not afford. They hoped the Council and the city government could strictly review the minimum amount, and then the Central Bank would be happy to provide the loan.

Reviewing the Amount in the Morning; Negotiating the Loan Again in the Afternoon

After Councilor Wang finished his report, the discussion of the loan amount began. Everyone agreed that the amount of over 4 million US dollars was astonishingly large. The initial plan was to reduce it to nearly 1 million US dollars. However, Speaker Pan indicated that the Council's responsibility was to determine the base figure and calculate the fees based on multiples of the cost of living index. As for the economic disconnect losses between upper and lower index periods, each company should find its own ways to manage. When they cannot find a way to manage, the city government should help them obtain loans from the Central Bank. The Council has no right or responsibility to determine the amount. Therefore, it was suggested that the Public Utilities Subcommittee, together with the city government, conduct a detailed review of the accounts to determine whether there was any concealment of inventory, and then determine the amount. This was unanimously approved. It was decided to expedite the review today in the morning and to visit Finance Minister Xu Kan before 2:00 PM this afternoon, and then proceed to the Central Bank at 3:00 PM to conduct loan negotiations.

### Tram Price Increase Rejected by Council

[Report from Our Newspaper] Director Zhao reported at the meeting yesterday that the tram fare in this city should be adjusted today according to the new regulations. The councilors unanimously decided to prohibit the price increase because the Guan Yuan pricing method has been abolished, and the Central Bank will provide loans for the loss portion.

### University Student Seeks Father but Fails; Stealing Clothing Leads to Suspended Sentence

[Report from Our Newspaper] Chen Jie, a student at the Central Political University in Nanjing, came to Shanghai from Nanjing on the ninth of last month. Unable to find his father and facing financial difficulties, he went to the Normal School on Wujin Road on the 24th of last month at noon to visit a friend. He entered the bedroom of Pan Xizhi, a student at the school, and stole clothing such as suit pants and shirts. Pan caught him on the spot and handed him over to the Hongkou Police Department, which transferred him to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. Presiding Judge Wu Xiangzu sentenced him to six months in prison yesterday, but considering that the defendant was forced to resort to such measures due to financial difficulties, he granted a three-year suspended sentence to allow him to rehabilitate himself.

### Male Corpse Found in Pudong; Shop Owner Suspected, Detained for Questioning

[Report from Our Newspaper] A male corpse was discovered yesterday morning by the Gaomugi Bridge riverbank in Lujiadu, Yangjing, Pudong. After receiving the report, the local police station immediately dispatched officers to investigate. It was learned that the deceased was named Fan Chuanxin, 35 years old, from Taizhou, residing at 26 Fukang Branch Road, Yangjiadu, and worked as a manure collector. The fatal injuries were located in both the head and neck. After investigation, it was discovered that Xu Guisheng, the owner of the Zhenxing store at that location, was highly suspected. Xu was detained for questioning.

### Bizarre Murder Case in Jiangsu Road, West Shanghai; Woman Dies Tragically by Knife; Room Clothes Disordered; Radio Seemingly Used as Cover

[Report from Our Newspaper] A bizarre murder case occurred at 46 A, Lane 763, Jiangsu Road, West Shanghai, yesterday at noon. The deceased was a middle-aged woman named Li Xiuzhen, who sustained a total of 13 knife wounds to her head and shoulders. Her husband, Wu Shiren (45 years old, from Shanghai), currently works as a coppersmith at the British-owned tram company and has been there for 26 years. He is usually kind to others. He and the deceased have a son and a daughter, Hui Guo (9 years old) and Meifeng, who are both studying at nearby Zhuan Elementary School. Yesterday, Wu went to work at the company as usual, and after Hui Guo and the others went to school, they returned home for lunch. They found the main door tightly closed and no response to their calls, so they played at the entrance of the lane. It was not until 5:00 PM, when Wu returned from the company, that he questioned the situation, which aroused suspicion, because the deceased usually did not go out. He hurried back to knock on the door, and at the same time, he saw the clothes in the room in disarray from the windows. The most bizarre thing was that the five-lamp radio, which was originally placed in the bedroom, had been moved to the entrance of the room, and the radio bulbs were still lit, indicating that someone had been listening to the program. However, after calling for a long time, there was no sound. He had no choice but to break the glass window of the back door to find a way in. At that time, Wu immediately smelled a strong smell of blood. When he entered the inner room, he suddenly saw his wife lying dead on the small bed against the corner of the wall, her face covered in blood, her hands seemingly struggling. Wu rushed out in horror and quickly informed nearby relatives and friends. He immediately reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Branch, which dispatched officers to investigate. The Criminal Investigation Division of the General Bureau also dispatched officers to the scene to take photos. The deceased was then transported to the mortuary for an autopsy. Afterwards, Wu inspected the clothes in the room and only discovered that the gold ring and two gemstone rings that the deceased used to wear were missing. Nothing else was missing. At the same time, according to Wu, his wife was usually honest and had very little contact with nearby residents. However, it is speculated that when the murderer acted, he placed the radio at the door and turned on the program to prevent the deceased's cries for help from reaching outside. Based on this, it can be inferred that the motive for the murder seems to be premeditated. The case is currently under detailed investigation by the police.

### Jiangxi Province Prohibits Clan Fights, Promulgates Handling Measures; Those Who Murder and Commit Arson Will Be Executed; Weapons on Both Sides Must Be Registered

— Our Reporter Liu Zao

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 8th] Clan fights in various parts of Jiangxi Province have progressed from individual combat with shoulder poles and iron hoes to trench warfare with machine guns and mortars. The Fenyi battle last year was the greatest scene in Jiangxi's clan fight war. Recently, bloody clashes have been occurring in Yugan, Nanchang, Xinyu, and other places. The Provincial Security Command feels unable to suppress these "local incidents" and is extremely distressed by the ineffectiveness of the bans.

Causes of Clan Fights

Looking at the clan fights in Jieqiao Lake, Zexi, and Chadong in Fenyi County, as well as the bloody cases in Meixi in Yugan and Jiangdongwei in Xinyu, it is truly heartbreaking. Why are the ignorant people of Jiangxi, a province known for its literary integrity, so eager to engage in private fights! According to general analysis, there are several reasons:

(1) Due to local factional rivalries, local bullies instigate behind the scenes, leading to clan fights.

(2) Due to surname prejudice and the influence of feudal tribal thinking, unequal distribution of obligations and rights within a surname, village, or township can lead to conflicts.

(3) Conflicts arise from disputes over farmland irrigation, fishing, grazing, forests, graves, or school property belonging to a surname or village.

(4) Local tyrants and gentry, as well as local factions, attempt to use clan fights to gain or maintain their feudal or unique positions and rights.

(5) Unemployed vagrants stir up trouble, leading to conflicts due to emotional impulses.

(6) Ignorant and foolish people are coerced into blindly participating. Chairman Fang Tianyi, noting the frequent occurrence of clan fights in various places, which not only damage local vitality but also undermine spiritual unity, has drafted measures to handle clan fights, which have been issued to various counties, and has published a "Respectful Announcement to the People of the Province on Eliminating Clan Fights."

Handling Measures

The provincial government has now decided that if such bloody incidents occur again in the future, they will be handled in accordance with the handling measures, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Those who initiate clan fights and those who instigate them behind the scenes will be severely punished in accordance with the law. (2) Those who participate in clan fights and commit murder or arson will be sentenced to death in accordance with the law. (3) In areas where clan fights occur, if the government's fair intervention is ineffective, or if the government's fair resolution is not accepted and clan fights continue, the government will send troops to suppress them. (4) In clan fight areas, the local government will immediately organize an impartial committee, appoint local impartial individuals to uphold justice, assess right and wrong, determine the criminal responsibility of offenders, and report them to the government for legal action. (5) All firearms and weapons on both sides participating in clan fights must be registered and branded within a time limit and will still be allocated to the local government for distribution to the public self-defense forces for self-defense purposes. (6) Those who blindly participate in clan fights will be drafted into military service. (7) If the heads of rural communities in clan fight areas fail to report the situation in advance, resulting in clan fights, they will be severely punished. (8) Those who secretly report the location of clan fight weapons and lead to their seizure will be generously rewarded.

### Jurong Once Looted; Captured Soldiers Wearing Pine Branches

Looted Items Returned to Original Owners

[Report from Our Newspaper, Jurong, 8th] On the afternoon of the 5th of this month, some local troops passing through to Gaochun, Lishui, and other places carried out looting. More than ten families in Doumen Village, including Yang Qiwen, were completely looted, with losses estimated at over a hundred thousand. The family of Li Depu in Xipu West Village was able to resist with knives and spears organized by the local community, preventing the looting. However, on the 6th, a large number of troops were specially dispatched, carrying various types of firearms and swarming into the village. They first tied up or monitored the villagers one by one. Five young people were injured for resisting. The entire village was eventually looted. Fortunately, the Internal Police Corps stationed at Tianwang Temple heard about it and immediately dispatched a detachment of police officers, who arrested the looting soldiers along with their firearms. Just as they were about to investigate, a high-ranking officer from the military unit arrived to negotiate. The looted items were returned to their original owners, and all the soldiers' weapons were also returned to the high-ranking officer, with the hope that such actions would not occur again in the future.

### Changzhou's "Endless Spring Sorrow" A Series of Kidnappings for Ransom

Spring has arrived in Changzhou, bringing with it a series of kidnapping cases, bizarre and grotesque, truly reflecting the suffering of the people amidst the military chaos of the Jiangnan region. The Seventh Replenishment Training Corps of the Ministry of National Defense was ostensibly meant to recruit wandering soldiers and stragglers. Company Commander Long Debin, Squad Leader Li Jiaxiang, and Sergeant Zhang Yonghong were busy in the West Gate area, arresting good citizens, falsely accusing them of being vagrants, and extorting white rice from them for ransom. More than eighty people were victimized. When the case was broken, Long, Li, Zhang, and others were arrested and are currently being interrogated. Coincidentally, while the case of the Replenishment Training Corps was developing, Dong Guoquan and others were also apprehended along the Miaoyan River. They relied on a certain military unit to arrest deserters, setting up an office along the Miaoyan River. Starting on the 19th of last month, they dispatched seven or eight soldiers to randomly arrest good citizens, totaling more than thirty-seven people. After extorting large sums of money from each of them, they released twenty-four people. There were still thirteen people who, because they had no money to redeem themselves, had their ears pierced with lead wire and were escorted to the railway station, intending to escape and turn them in. However, the net of justice is far-reaching, and they were finally apprehended by the city defense force. After interrogation, they confessed to the kidnapping and extortion. On the 7th, all the criminals, Dong Guoquan, Yin Dezhong, Wang Zifeng, Chen Yunlan, Yang Yicheng, Lu Fengshan, Tang Yuanzu, Gao Shoushan, and Zhang Junsheng, were transferred to the Pacification Command for legal action. Before the dust settled from one incident, another arose. Wang Yaocheng, the owner of the Daan Hotel in Hualong Lane, went to the countryside to attend a relative's banquet on the morning of the 5th and disappeared that day. The next day, a young man named Chen Chunsheng, using the pseudonym Wang, went to the hotel and claimed that its owner had been arrested by a certain military unit for a case and that he would not be released unless 50 shi of rice was paid as a lobbying fee, and that his life was in danger. He also claimed that military secrets could not be leaked. After repeated negotiations, the hotel agreed to pay 20 shi for his release. On the 7th, while retrieving the money, they were finally apprehended by the city defense force. The incident involved a secret organization. At the office of the Chengyu Flour Mill in Yangliu Lane in the city, three uninvited guests suddenly arrived at around 9:00 PM on the 5th, one in plain clothes and two in uniform. Under the pretext of checking household registrations, they robbed the guard Zhang Fusheng of a fast-slow machine gun and fled. Afterwards, the police station dispatched officers and were busy for a while, but that was the end of it. (Our Reporter Li Tianhang)

### Chengfa County Hears of Threatening Letter Case; Forensic Doctor Liu Boqun Arrested

[Report from Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, 9th] A threatening incident that occurred in the city recently caused a sensation and was quickly solved by the police. Yang Xiepei, the chief of the eleventh Bao of Zhongshan Town, relying on the legacy of his ancestors, had some assets. Starting on the 19th of last month, he received three threatening letters signed "Chen Tong, Director of the Eighth Route Army Second Regiment Office in Chengfa," demanding 5 qian of gold. The letter also contained a bullet. The content was absurd, instructing him to place the gold in the stone crevice on the southwest corner of Masi Bridge. Chief Yang sent a gold ring weighing 2.5 qian to Masi Bridge while secretly dispatching personnel to observe. They saw a person lingering there. Upon questioning, the person presented a forensic officer's certificate from the Jiangyin District Court, with the name Liu Boqun. Because there was no other evidence, he was not detained. On the 5th of this month, Yu Fusen, the owner of the Baosheng Silver Shop on Nanheyan Street in Hongqiao, also received the same threatening letter with the same signature, with five bullets attached. The intelligence department devised various plans and learned that Yang's ring was at the relative's house of Zhang Shaolin, a cadre in Zhongshan Town, and that the gold ring had been taken by Liu Boqun and pawned. On the 7th, the county government sent police to Wenheng Bridge to arrest Liu and found four rifle bullets, a bottle of blue ink, letter paper, and a fake seal carved from soap, as well as a letter to Deputy Adjutant Yang Zhonglun of the Nanyuan Garden Hotel in Changshu. He was immediately taken to the county government, where the military law office interrogated him all night. Liu Boqun firmly denied the case, only claiming that the bullets were left behind by the army, that the letter was written by Gu Yuanhong from Jijiashi in Jiangbei, who had returned home last winter, and that the gold ring belonged to Ding A'gen, a tea server at the Dadong Hotel in Beiwai. However, he admitted to smoking opium for a year and currently serving as a forensic officer at the District Court. The county government, considering the seriousness of the case, detained Liu, while collecting strong evidence for strict legal action.

### Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund: Approved Students to Receive Payments Starting Tomorrow Upon Presentation of Notification Slips

Those Who Have Already Received Aid Elsewhere Must Voluntarily Declare and Forfeit

The Shen Bao "Readers' Scholarship Fund" has been expediting the review and payment procedures in recent days. Details have been published in the social services section of this newspaper over the past two days. The rice obtained from the scholarship fund was sold at a price of 27,000 yuan per shi at the North City Market on the 9th. A certain enthusiastic scholarship supporter purchased it. However, the "7" character in yesterday's report of 27,000 yuan was mistakenly printed as "5," so this is corrected.

The purpose of the scholarship fund is to help outstanding students from poor families. Occasionally, a few students from well-off families attempt to obtain scholarships. In addition to announcing the cancellation of Hou Deji and Shi Zhilin yesterday, similar situations will be handled accordingly in the future. Even if they have already received the money, it will still be recovered from the guarantors.

Furthermore, it is hoped that each student who receives the payment notification slip issued by this newspaper yesterday will follow the required procedures, affixing the original seal and coming to the office to receive the payment to avoid unnecessary trips.

### Three-Person Team Studies Technical Improvements; National Bank Continues Gold Allocation Yesterday; Tightening of Credit Leads to Gradual Decrease in Gold Market

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Bank, due to excessive gold price fluctuations the previous day and a significant discrepancy between the allocated price and the market price, held a careful discussion of technical improvements by a three-person team yesterday morning. Therefore, the opening price for jewelry stores was delayed until 10:30 AM. The allocated price was determined to be 290,000 yuan, and jewelry stores were notified to apply if needed. The application period in the morning was extended until 12:30 PM. As a result, over 1,000 taels were allocated. In the afternoon, jewelry stores were notified to continue selling at the old allocated price, but because the market price was low, no one applied.

Later, the person in charge of the National Bank's business bureau told reporters that the National Bank is still considering expanding the scope of gold allocation. However, at present, the method of selling gold, although seemingly through jewelry stores, is based on money, not personal connections. As long as there is capital, sales will be maximized. At the same time, various effective methods are being adopted in the market to achieve the goal of controlling gold prices. The low gold price today (the 10th) is clear evidence of this. As for the public market for gold and silver, it is still being actively organized. Regarding the rumor that a large amount of remittances from other cities has recently arrived in Shanghai, he said he had not heard of it.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday's gold market opened low in the morning, with prices ranging from 295,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan due to tight credit. Later, as the credit situation worsened, market prices gradually decreased, reaching a low of 284,000 to 287,000 yuan. There was a rumor in the market that transfer requests from money exchange companies were no longer being approved for customers. Therefore, the gold industry, for the sake of caution, closed the market around 11:30 AM, with prices at 287,000 to 290,000 yuan. When the market opened at 2:00 PM, credit remained tight, and the market remained stagnant. It finally closed at 300,000 to 303,000 yuan. If the daily interest rate of one yuan is deducted, this price is equivalent to a gold market price of only 270,000 yuan that day.

### Sudden Tightening of Credit; Continued Decline in Chinese Stocks

At a time when the monetary authorities are selling goods to suppress prices, credit has tightened again, buying sentiment is dissipating, and with half an hour until closing, there were even rumors that the Central Bank had issued a notice to stop the use of exchange application forms, in order to reduce the time of currency circulation.  As such, speculative buyers felt even more constrained, selling off holdings to avoid high interest rates. Thus, the price of Wing On Textile stock, after breaking through 5.20 yuan, declined sharply, and closed at its low for the day of 4.87 yuan, returning to its price at the beginning of the week. Its high price at the beginning of trading was 5.42 yuan, and the low price was 4.87 yuan, with a fluctuation range of 0.55 yuan.

### Decline in Foreign Stocks After Showing Initial Strength

Foreign stocks, after showing initial strength, turned weak. Credit in the circle was quite tight, with the daily interest rate above 80 yuan. As such, sentiment became even more fragile.

However, this is still subject to approval by the Lending Committee next week.

### Goods Owners Continue to Raise Prices; Rice Prices Continue to Rise; Flour and Oil Markets See Slight Declines at Closing

Rice prices continue to rise, as goods owners continue to raise prices due to higher prices for other goods the previous day. Early trading in white rice and thin paddy rice broke through the 30,000 yuan mark, trading at 30,500 yuan. Later, due to a shortage of speculative funds and tight credit, prices fell back. White rice in the North Market ended at 30,000 yuan, up 2,000 yuan. Special rice traded at a high price of 31,100 yuan. Thick and thin rice in the South Market each rose by more than 2,000 yuan. Total arrivals in the two markets amounted to 8,373 shi.

Edible Oil: Prices continued to rise, but sentiment turned weak at the closing, and the final settlement was still higher. The initial opening was stable, but buying sentiment in the Central Market was very strong. Rapeseed oil reached 120,000 yuan, and soybean oil reached a high of 127,000 yuan. The closing price was finally affected by tight credit and falling speculative prices, and prices fell back. Soybean oil closed at 122,000 yuan, up 7,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil closed at 114,000 yuan, up 4,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil in the Central Market opened at 150,000 yuan (per 9-gallon barrel), up 12,000 yuan. Soybean cake closed flat.

Flour: Under the Central Bank's strenuous efforts to tighten credit, sellers were eager to sell. Although the initial market once rose due to rising rice prices, the market ultimately weakened due to high interest rates and fragile sentiment, and rumors of selling goods never stopped. Buyers were cautious and did not dare to report in large quantities. Old Brand closed at 12,850 yuan, and Warship closed at 12,310 yuan in the after-market, slightly higher than the previous day. Bran was slightly higher, and the Big Package Fuxin brand stabilized at 10,000.

Other Grains: The rising trend slowed down. Soybean prices slightly rebounded after rising, due to a weakening of oil cake. Vehicle beans fell by 1,000 yuan in the after-market, trading at 27,000 yuan. Sesame and mung beans rose by 2,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were stable. Corn and red sorghum slightly trended upward.

### Sugar Market Stable and Firm

Yesterday's sugar market saw very high interest rates due to tight credit, but actual sales were still brisk, and buyers from the "native" group constantly replenished their supplies. Market conditions were nominally rising but effectively stable. Number Four-and-a-Half sugar first traded at 53,000 yuan. Upon hearing that gold prices had fallen, sentiment became very weak, and the price once fell to 51,500 yuan. Subsequently, buyers from the "native" group acted, buying sentiment unfolded, and quoted prices rebounded. The price closed near noon at 52,000 yuan. Coarse sugar was at 49,500 yuan, up 2,500 yuan. Medium sugar, red cotton, second-grade Taiwan red cotton, and white cotton were not traded. The rest were up a thousand yuan each.

### Tea Market Circuitously Moving Firm

Yesterday's black and green tea were still favored by buyers. However, transactions continued to be withered due to scarcity and shortage of supply. The trend, in the above circumstances, was not constrained by tight credit, and was instead circuitously moving firm. Prices, however, were uniformly stable nominally and firm effectively, depending on the goods. It is learned that currently in Suzhou, Wuxi and other places, all comers were accepting the black tea, and they have been sending staffs to search and collect. If this is achieved, it will be lively.

### Tung Oil Rises Again

Yesterday's tung oil market first rose and then leveled off. The morning opening was driven by robust trading in foreign exchange transfer certificates. Buying sentiment was strong, and sellers were raising prices aggressively. The market advanced boldly. Subsequently, amid tight credit, all industries were hit, and the rising trend came to an abrupt halt. However, compared with the previous day, the final settlement was still quite a bit higher.

### Coal Prices Adjusted Again Yesterday

According to sources at the Four Mines Joint Operations Office, fuel allocation prices were adjusted again yesterday. The allocated price for domestic bituminous coal was increased to 83,220 yuan per ton, up 12,820 yuan from the previous level. White coal nuts and small coal were at 90,000 yuan per ton, white coal lumps were at 130,000 yuan, and white coal dross was at 80,000 yuan. The barge transportation fee remained at 8,000 yuan. However, there was still no foreign coal available, and allocation was temporarily suspended.

### Silk Weak

Yesterday's artificial silk market conditions were weak due to unusually tight credit in the market and the fact that prices of goods outside the industry had stopped rising and had instead fallen. Sentiment was fragile, and the market declined.

The opening price for Grade 3 bright light "102" New Goods was 1.4 million. The trend after the opening was very weak, but due to short covering from the previous day, buying sentiment slightly moved, and quoted prices rose by 30,000 yuan. Subsequently, as gold and banknotes weakened and credit tightened, the rate of daily interest continued to rise, and sales continued unabated. The market re-entered a weak phase, and there was still no improvement at closing. The midday closing price for spot goods was 1.4 million, with tomorrow's futures at 1.49 million yuan. In the afternoon, the trend of tight credit continued to be favorable. Speculative gold and banknotes outside the circle weakened with interest rates. The market was still weak. The initial trading price for Toyo was 1.442 million yuan. After 3:00 PM, gold gradually fell from 310 to between 303. Sentiment was still weak, and quoted prices declined again. The market finally closed at 1.427 million yuan.

Yesterday, foreign exchange certificate prices for raw silk rose, and sentiment stabilized slightly. However, due to tight credit in the market and difficulty in turning over short positions, the market was stable and weak. The initial opening price for "78" Evenness White Filature was 2.1 million. It once rebounded to 2.18 million, but later gold prices fell, and the market for spun yarn and cloth outside the industry weakened. The market was unsustainable, and prices immediately trended downward, falling to 2 million at the close near noon. The market was mediocre in the afternoon, but local merchants searched for goods at low prices, and the trading price was slightly higher at 2.05 million yuan.

The silk and satin market was also weak yesterday. Credit within the industry was generally tight, and interest rates increased. Speculative sellers released goods to earn interest, and bulls had strong intentions to go short. Market conditions were first stable and then weak, and prices finally declined at midday closing. The morning opening price for American Asian quilt covers was 965,000 yuan. The trend after the opening was mediocre, but bulls wanted to pull the market up before releasing goods, and the quoted price once rose by 10,000 yuan. However, because the general trend outside the industry was weak, gold and banknotes fell, and Chinese stocks were still weak, the market was unable to struggle, and quoted prices declined, reaching a low of 935,000 yuan. The market still closed at the original level near noon. In the afternoon, the trend of gold and banknotes was initially stable, but it was still weak. Sentiment was lax. The market was initially stable due to the rising gold price with interest rates. The initial quoted price was 960,000 or 970,000, and it once fell to 940,000. It finally closed at 925,000 yuan.

### Price List Determined

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Trust Bureau's meeting on artificial silk on the 9th resolved that: The artificial silk price for the 10th period of this year (July 7 to July 12) for Italian goods, Grade 3 bright light "120", is 1,128,000 gold yuan per case.

### Credit Particularly Tight; Daily Interest Rate as High as 150; Tightness Increased After Noon; Settlement Today Still Likely to Remain Tight

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday's credit market in Shanghai was tight throughout the day. The market opened with the settlement of over 1.1 billion yuan in yesterday's spun yarn and cloth, which was immediately due for payment. Credit immediately tightened, and the daily interest rate opened at 80 yuan. However, since borrowing exceeded lending everywhere, and it was said that money exchange companies were not accommodating customers' transfer requests, the daily interest rate gradually rose to 90 to 95 yuan. After noon, the tightness increased, and the daily interest rate hit the 100 yuan mark, once rising as high as 150 yuan. After 4:00 PM, there were many in the industry who lacked orders, and inter-industry lending was at 120 yuan.

The net difference of the State Bank was 67.617 million yuan, the net difference of foreign banks was 59.682 million yuan, the net difference of the Large Exchange was 21.707 million yuan, and the net difference of the Small Exchange was 105.592 million yuan.

In addition, there will be a huge settlement of over 2.1 billion yuan in spun yarn and cloth from the Central Bank and the Textile Construction Company today, so liquidity is likely to maintain yesterday's tightness.

### Market Stroll; Viewing Platform

Price Falls Little, Pulling is Not Much; Price Falls Much, Pulling is a Lot; Pei Tsu-yi and Hu Hou-chin's Gold Battles Reenacted

Yesterday's credit was very tight, with the black market rate at the end of the evening rising by more than 1.5 yuan, which was truly shocking.

Everyone said credit was tight because the authorities were selling off large quantities of goods. Yesterday, the authorities' efforts were real. At the same time, manufacturers were also selling off goods to raise funds for the mid-month wages, which further contributed to the falling trend.

We have already analyzed that if selling off goods can truly tighten credit, then prices will not be supported. If prices follow the sale of goods, then credit has not been tightened.

This causal relationship is very clear. Selling goods, and being able to tighten credit, must be because someone is buying them. Since someone is buying them, prices cannot fall. This is also certain.

If selling goods brings prices down, surely no one is accepting them. Since no one is buying them, credit is not being tightened. This is also certain.

Of course, the market situation is definitely not that simple, but in any case, it does not go beyond this basic principle.

The biggest features of yesterday's market trend were: (1) the reduction in the amount of applications for gold allocation; (2) the worst stock market decline; (3) gold and banknotes once fell below the Central Bank's official price in the afternoon, but later rebounded slightly, but still did not match the interest rate; (4) rice prices uniquely soared; (5) industrial products such as cigarettes and candles fell particularly sharply; (6) imported goods, although they fell, did not fall much.

Logically, if gold and banknotes are hit, speculative funds can flow into the stock market, but the stock market did not improve yesterday, which shows that it was a credit issue.

The small number of applications for gold allocation and the fact that prices once fell below the official price in the afternoon show that the jewelry stores that applied for gold allocation the day before yesterday could not find liquidity yesterday and had to sell off their holdings. This is why this strange phenomenon occurred. In that case, the credit crunch is in the jewelry industry, and they have once again fallen into the net laid by Pei Tsu-yi's gold policy. Pei Tsu-yi has successors.

The unique surge in rice prices and the sharp drop in industrial products show that manufacturers had to cut goods to raise funds for the mid-month salary. This has nothing to do with farmers and nothing to do with rice prices, so rice prices uniquely rose.

The fact that imported goods did not weaken much is similar to the rice market.

If this analysis is correct, then those who were truly selling off goods yesterday were probably jewelry stores and manufacturers. The authorities may also have sold off goods, but it was certainly not as much as advertised.

Market volatility is greatly affected by psychology. Advertising has become a tool for both sides to fight, and it is especially necessary to exaggerate advertising for those who despise the authorities' strength.

The day before yesterday, we also pointed out that any rise before the middle of the month is not genuine. Yesterday's market conditions illustrate this fact.

Today is Friday, and tomorrow is Saturday. Manufacturers who are concerned about interest rates sell off holdings to pay the interest rate and pay salaries when they are due. This calculation means that earlier is cheaper.

### Jewelry Store Business Suddenly Hot and Cold; Complaining About Difficulty Finding Credit

[Our Newspaper's Report] The opening time of the jewelry stores in this city yesterday was delayed until after 10:30 AM because the Central Bank reported the market price too late. Because the public saw that the gold market had soared the previous day, but the Central Bank was still asking jewelry stores to sell gold at an allocated price of 250,000 yuan, it was generally believed that it would still be cheap to buy today. Before the opening of each jewelry store, there were many customers waiting with cash at the door. After the doors opened, they suddenly saw that the posted price for bars had been changed to 295,800 yuan, and the price for jewelry gold was 300,700 yuan. Many were disappointed and left. However, because the gold market was still stable in the morning, and after receiving the Central Bank's notification of an allocation of 290,000, the number of applications for allocation from colleagues actually exceeded 1,000 taels. However, the market weakened in the afternoon. If the daily interest rate is deducted, then the National Bank's allocated price had already exceeded the market price, so everyone requested to return the gold they had already applied for to the National Bank. The National Bank did not grant their request, and each jewelry store had to find credit to repay the payment for the gold they had applied for, and everyone complained. The retail business of each jewelry store also suddenly turned calm due to the low gold price, which was a strong contrast to the situation in recent days.

### Spun Yarn Prices Turned Down After Rising; Cotton Cloth Hovered in a Weak Range

The rising trend of cotton yarn has been contained. This is because the authorities are selling off goods and tightening credit. Yesterday's interest rate was between 80 yuan and 100 yuan, so sellers were eager to sell because they could not bear the heavy interest burden. Buyers were also mostly adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Each yarn price turned down after rising, and the final settlement was a decline.

"42" count Blue Phoenix rose from 2.18 million yuan to a high of 2.23 million yuan, and the closing price was 2.07 million yuan, a drop of 110,000 yuan. "40" count Blue Phoenix dropped 80,000 yuan, and "32" count Silver Moon dropped 90,000 yuan, closing at 1.37 million yuan.

"21" count Double Horse spot goods opened at 1.07 million yuan. It once rose to 1.11 million yuan in the middle, but ultimately weakened due to tight credit and retreated to 1.025 million yuan at closing, a drop of 125,000 yuan from the previous level. Factory orders traded at 1.02 million yuan. Each grade of "20" count consistently fell within the pass, trading at around 950,000 yuan. Each grade of "16" count and below also languished.

Cotton cloth hovered in a weak range. The market opened in the morning with a trend towards tight credit, and also due to the excessive increase the previous day. People were cautious, and speculative buyers sold off goods. But there were many short covering, so supply and demand were still balanced.

The opening price for Longtou fine cloth was 40,600 yuan, and the price for Four Gentlemen Yuan Biji was 39,900 yuan. Before the Textile Construction Company announced its opening price, each once rose by 500 yuan, but there was still a slight decline after the announcement. The former closed at 40,700 yuan, and the latter closed at 39,700 yuan, roughly the same as the midday closing price on the previous day, but softer than the after-market outside trading price.

The opening price for Laba Tong fine cloth was 39,500 yuan, eventually rising 700 yuan. There were slight fluctuations in each grade of fine cloth. The factory price for high-grade "190" Shilins approached the 90,000 yuan mark, at 89,000 yuan. Printed Biji was at 45,000 yuan, White Cat printed cloth was at 40,000 yuan, and Daming silk was at 70,000 yuan.

### China Textile Sells Off Spun Yarn and Cloth

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Bank and the US Aid Commission continued to entrust the Textile Construction Company to sell yarn in the market yesterday, opening three times, selling a total of 1,034 pieces, approving the purchase of 196 households, with a value of 969,560,000 yuan.

The process of each sale was as follows: (1) "20" count Treasure Ship was sold for 677 pieces, at a price of 940,000 yuan. 97 households applied to purchase 465 pieces, which were allocated accordingly.

There was also one type of end cloth, selling a total of 43,200 yards. There were four types of quilts, selling a total of 740 pieces. The total value was 1,158,136,000 yuan.

### Olympic Women's Champion: Biography of Mrs. Koen, the Dutch Flying General

— Translated by Ding Xin

An introduction to Mrs. Koen, the fastest woman in the world, who shocked the 1948 Olympic Games. At home, in the kitchen, with her husband, sons, and daughters, she doesn't seem like an athlete, but a virtuous wife and loving mother.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] When Mrs. Fanfu Koen returned to her homeland, Amsterdam, from the London Olympics with four shimmering gold medals, the usually dignified and quiet capital of the Netherlands went almost mad.

It was a sunny autumn day in August. A magnificent carriage drawn by four white horses carried the holder of three world records, her husband, and her two children, slowly from the train station to the city hall. There, the mayor was waiting to shake hands and congratulate this female hero who had brought glory to the country, and tens of thousands of people were waiting to admire her appearance and voice. Along the way, countless people who couldn't squeeze into the city hall desperately crowded on the roadside, on balconies, and in upstairs windows, vying to stick their heads out from the crowd, hoping to get even an unclear glimpse lasting only a few seconds. On the carriage, Fanny was not only the focus of millions of eyes and the target of millions of voices, but also a moving target—a target of flowers. Although her seven-year-old son desperately threw back out the bouquets falling on the carriage, Fanny seemed to be standing on a flower car.

In the city hall, Mrs. Koen only used three simple and honest sentences to answer the mayor's eulogy. She said, "I just run a little faster. My husband, I, and our two children make up a very ordinary family. The reason why the public is so enthusiastic about me is probably because my training and victories are all accomplished by taking time out from the busy schedule of washing dishes and mending socks!"

Indeed, from my observation during the week I spent with them, this family is undoubtedly a typical example of a myriad of European middle-class families—diligent, simple, and very resolute. They live a very ordinary life. They live in a small apartment in a four-story brick building; worry about the inadequacy of rationed goods; read publications borrowed from the book and newspaper circulation society; play bridge; and socialize with relatives and friends. Their only hobby outside of daily life is sports.

Fanny and her husband—Jann, are a very harmonious couple. Jann used to be a bank clerk and is now a sports instructor at the Dutch capital's police station. He is also a track and field athlete and has won several championships. Since discovering Fanny's talent on the track in 1935, he has been Fanny's personal coach, so Fanny's achievements today are half due to Jann's efforts. He is fourteen years and three days older than Fanny, and coupled with his gentle appearance and neat grooming, Fanny loves him as a husband and respects him as a teacher. At any banquet or invitation, Fanny always replies with "Let me ask Jann," even in the most ordinary daily conversations, Fanny always follows Jann's wishes.

Although the couple love and care for each other, Jann is extremely serious about coaching Fanny. Fanny always takes Jann's praise as a special honor, overwhelmed by favor. Last autumn, after Fanny won her third championship at the London World Games, Jann made an exception to kiss Fanny on the cheek to congratulate her on her amazing achievement. This was only after the photographers pleaded bitterly!

Fanny's parents are both still alive. These two burly and extraordinary old people in their late sixties still swim, ice skate, and play tennis every day, running and jumping all day long, without showing the slightest sign of old age. (To be continued)

(Top picture) The moment Mrs. Koen reaches the finish line, her ten fingers show her tense emotions. (Bottom picture) She and her husband, who is also her coach Jann, pose for a photo. Hanging on the wall are many glorious medals, which are their joint achievements.

### Huili Force Feeling Tense; Encas Wins by Half a Point

[Report from This Newspaper] In last night's basketball league, Huili Force was miserably defeated by Encas by a mere one point, with the final score being 40 to 39. In the first half, both sides played very tightly, resulting in a score of 19 to 12. Encas's Bo Tou was very successful last night, and the big fat Qiu Quhu also moved like a startled rabbit. Both of them are new players, and their performance was very outstanding. When Huili Force's main player, Ge Peng Qiguofu, injured his hand and left the court in the first half, Huili Force had an opportunity to take advantage, but unfortunately, due to excessive tension, they missed all their free throws in the last few minutes, leading to this miserable situation. Although more than a thousand fans cheered enthusiastically, they left disappointed. In another game in the A1 group, Pei Feier defeated Mai Ling, 56 to 39. In the A2 C group, Pei Er defeated Tie Lian, 44 to 30.

In the game between Encas and Huili Force, the Encas players who started were Ao Chailiao, Sha Sijin, Ge Peng Qiguofu, Bo Tou, and Que Libotuo. Huili Force countered with Tian Fuhai, Wang Yongfang, Ye Yunshan, Cao Zhiji, and Wei Xu.

After the start of the game, Sha Sijin scored first, followed by Yi Fuhai. Ao and Yongfang each made a free throw, tying the score at three points. Wei Xu scored a basket, showing Huili Force's determination. When Ge Bo added three points, Encas chased to 6 to 5. After Chen Zhengmiao replaced Yongfang, Que Li scored again. Through the efforts of Ye and Wei, Huili Force took the lead again at 9 to 8. Encas's big fat Qiu Quhu replaced Sha Sijin, and Botuo did not relax at all. Bo Tou was even able to shoot into the basket with one hand. At this point, the situation was very tense. At 17 to 12, Ge Pengqi injured his hand and left the court, and Sha Sijin returned to the court. The first half ended at 19 to 12.

In the second half, Kai Jiermiluo replaced Sha Sijin, and Huili Force's Yongfang replaced Zhengmiao. Bo Tou fired cold shots from the crowd, and Fuhai scored two consecutive goals, with Yongfang "not yielding." Unexpectedly, opponents Bo Tou and Qiu Quhu were also calm and composed, doing as they pleased. Huili Force still closely followed, and when Wei Xu scored, they were only half a point behind (28 to 27). Unfortunately, Yongfang missed a free throw, otherwise, they would have tied the score long ago. Bo Tou scored another long shot from half court. Looking at Huili Force, Yunshan lacked luck, but Old Tian was indeed blessed, living up to his name, and forced the score to 30 to 29, still a one-point difference. Zhengmiao replaced Wei Cheng, and Yongfang charged in lightly, making the score 31 to 30, with Huili Force taking the lead. Chen committed a foul, Bo Tou made two free throws, and Sha Sijin scored a goal. Although Zhiji returned a free throw, Encas was already leading by two points. Que Li made a free throw, and Yongfang flipped up and shot a goal. Ao Chailiao committed a foul for obstruction, and Wang made another free throw, suddenly tying the score at 35. The stadium was filled with cheers. Sha Sijin attacked along the side, and Encas scored two more points. At that time, there were still two minutes left in the game. Tian did not score, Wang did not make a free throw, but the foreign fat guy scored a goal, and Ao scored one point from a free throw. Although Cao Zhiji and Tian Fuhai later added two goals successively, time was running out, and Encas finally won by a one-point difference with a score of 40 to 39.

### Sports World: Fighting and Losing Repeatedly, Losing and Fighting Repeatedly; Movie Stars Playing Ball: Good Gimmick; Shi Hui's "Tipping Toilet," Zhang Fa's Strange Movements

[Special Report from This Newspaper] Although the "You Yi" basketball team's skills are not very good, it has many spectators. It turns out that this basketball team is organized by colleagues in the film and theater industry. Whenever the You Yi team has a game, fans and movie fans come together to watch, so there are more people supporting the team. However, most of the audience is not familiar with the You Yi basketball team, so I will briefly introduce it based on what I know:

The You Yi team was established last year in Ren Yue. At that time, "The Great Reunion" was being staged at the Lyceum Theater. A group of friends backstage suddenly had a whim and proposed to gather colleagues in the film and theater industry to form a basketball team. As soon as the proposal was made, everyone agreed. Although some of them didn't fully understand the basketball rules, the team was still established.

In order to be casual, they lightly gave it the name "You Yi," meaning that no matter what, there is now another basketball team in the world! After each practice or game, they would say to themselves: We have practiced once again, we have lost once again, we have won once again!

After its establishment, they asked Cai Lianke, the captain of the Dagong team, to help guide them, and they did improve a lot. Unfortunately, because their original work was very stressful, they could not spare the time to practice well.

Before the start of the fourth city league, encouraged by Qian Xucang, the chairman of the basketball committee, they resolutely participated in the competition of the Shen Second Group. As the saying goes: A newborn calf is not afraid of a tiger. The You Yi team was able to show its skills in the league because of this fearless spirit.

There were dozens of friends who loved basketball, but due to the restrictions of the registration rules, only ten were selected to participate in the league.

The consultants of the You Yi basketball team are the heads of major film companies. Their leader is Chen Zhonghao, the president of the China Drama Society. Mr. Chen is also a key figure in the China Electric and Mandarin companies. He is enthusiastic, friendly, and loyal, and everyone in the film and theater industry is happy to be friends with him.

The manager is Hong Mo, a director of the Mandarin company. He comes to the scene to plan and cheer for every game.

The secretary is Fang Bo, the only fat comrade in the film and theater industry who loves to play basketball. He is always the first to arrive at the practice field, and his spirit is the best.

The captain, Zhang Fa, has a clear mind, is brave in grabbing and diving for the ball, and sometimes makes strange movements, which the audience praises endlessly.

The guard, Jin Yan, is a veteran of the former Weiming team. He has rich experience, is tall and long-armed, and has skills under the basket.

The forward, Shi Hui, uses the "tipping toilet" posture when shooting. When he is in good form, he makes every shot, and his performance is amazing.

Wei Yuping, serving as a forward, is the most fascinated player in the You Yi team. He never forgets basketball while eating and chatting. He is elastic, jumps high, and is also good at long shots.

Ling Zhihao was a Tianjin league player before. He is tall and has a good grasp of the ball under the basket.

Han Fei is short and nimble, and his movements are clever. He is good at stealing the ball, and sometimes his long shots will go into the basket, even he himself doesn't know why.

He Lu is the left guard and also played ball in Chongqing. He practices very diligently.

Luo Chongzhou is a photographer. He is a veteran of playing basketball and has a very calm demeanor.

The set designer, Su Shifeng, was a basketball star in middle school. Although he is thin, he works hard to practice, and his shooting is gradually becoming normal. He is a scoring expert for the You Yi team.

Wang Xuewu is a veteran comrade in the film and theater industry and also a veteran of the basketball scene, adding a lot of glory to the You Yi team.

In addition to participating in the fourth league, the You Yi team often plays friendly matches with other teams. However, to put it bluntly, they have been fighting and losing repeatedly. However, their spirit is good, and they lose and fight repeatedly. Therefore, the number of spectators and supporters is no less than that of the Shanghai League champion, Hualian. (Chen Chang)

### Hong Kong Governor's Cup Football Final: Hualian Team Carefully Selected

[Hong Kong Airmail] The Hong Kong branch of the National Sports Association, in order to select the Hualian representatives for the Governor's Cup final on the 20th of this month, has studied the three positions of center back, right wing, and center forward. As a result, it is generally believed that Miao Changrong's recent performance has been very good and should be given importance to promote new blood. Zhu Yongqiang is in good condition recently and should be allowed to lead the team. Feng Jingxiang's cross-passing skills are excellent and his style is experienced. Since there is a forward with Wei Cili in the center, it is more appropriate to have someone with proficient skills as a forward, which seems more stable than using new blood. Therefore, the following lineup was selected by majority vote. As for calling up substitutes, it is for the purpose of being prepared for any eventuality:

(Leader) Cai Huihong (Captain) Yu Yaode

Yu Yaode (Nannan)

Wei Jinhong (Nannan) Hou Rongsheng (Nannan)

Zhang Jinhai (Nannan) Miao Changrong (Zhonghua) Liu Songsheng (Nannan)

Li Dahui (Bus) Yu Wenzhi (Bus) Zhu Yongqiang (Nanpu) Li Chunfa (Bus) Feng Jingxiang (Nannan)

(Alternates) Yu Qi'en (Zhonghua), Li Bingnan (Zhonghua), Tan Zhenhui (Batu), Kong Qingyu (Bus), Chen Jinpei (Zhonghua), Deng Sen (Zhonghua), Li Bingzhao (Kitchee), Deng Yijie (Bus), Yao Zhuoran (Kitchee).

From right to left: (Back row) Ling Zhihao, Jin Yan, He Lu, Han Fei. (Front row) Wang Xuewu, Su Shifeng, Shi Hui, Zhang Fa.

### Official Language and Circulation

— Observer

Every time I read the newspaper and see that when a high-ranking official such as a provincial chairman or chief takes office, the first thing they do after getting off the car is to deliver a grand speech, the conclusion of which must be: I will, of course, first stabilize local order, improve the people's lives, and relieve the suffering of the people of this province, and so on.

It is as if the order in the province has always been chaotic, waiting for him to stabilize it; and the people of the province have always been suffering extremely, waiting for him to relieve them. But when the revolving lantern turns, this high-ranking official steps down again, and another new high-ranking official takes office. The new official has to give another speech, preparing to relieve the suffering of the people under the previous official's rule.

How strange! What exactly is going on? I want to relieve the suffering of your people, but when he takes office, he wants to relieve the suffering of my people. It can be seen that the suffering of the people has never been relieved, and perhaps it is getting worse. Otherwise, why is the first sentence of every new official always to relieve the suffering of the people of the province?

I am poor and only serve as an eighth-grade civil servant. I have never been a high-ranking official, so I don't know whether the previous official feels offended when the new official says that he wants to relieve the suffering of the people under his rule, or suspects that the new official is deliberately trying to undermine him, implying that he did not do a good job. I think it probably doesn't matter, because when I took office at the time, or when my official luck turned and I went to take office in another province, I would also say the same thing.

I want to relieve suffering when I take office, and you still want to relieve suffering when you take office, and so on in a continuous cycle. Official language cannot be taken literally, but the fact that the suffering of the people has never been relieved is evidenced even from this official language, which is a direct admission.

Newspapers should only be read casually and never carefully. Otherwise, if you think carefully about this kind of thing, you can't help but laugh or cry.

### The Price of Marriage in Hollywood

— Qiu Qu

Some people estimate that it costs $10,000 a year to support a wife in Hollywood.

If you want to divorce this wife after a year, it will cost about $100,000.

Most male stars can't come up with this money now. After about 75% of their income is taken away by government agencies or personal managers, there is very little left.

The distribution of this cost is as follows: First, you have to buy her a fur coat; second, she also has to have a coat, all women have one. Then, you buy her two more dresses, a diamond ring, and a necklace.

You may also have to buy her a convertible car so that she can run around and spend money in more places. If she has a child, you have to hire a nanny. And she takes all her old girlfriends out to dinner, and the bill is, of course, on your account.

This is the cost of the first year, $10,000.

After the first year, some stars get a divorce and have to pay $10,000 a year in alimony for the next ten years. So, they marry another wife, which is another $10,000.

One big star earned nearly $800,000 in the past two years. But now, he is penniless. Why? Because he has to pay alimony to several divorced wives in installments, and before the previous debts are cleared, new debts come. And, he has to buy things for his girlfriends right now. It would be strange if he could save a penny.

### Siamese "Police Cats"

— Mao Yi

Most people only know that cats catch mice, and few people know that there is actually a cat that catches thieves, and that is the Siamese cat. For hundreds of years, the Siamese have used cats instead of watchdogs, training them to identify and attack thieves. The royal palaces and official residences in Bangkok were once protected by special patrol cats.

When these royal cats are "on duty," they prowl around their posts like sentries, never loafing or running away. If someone tries to climb over the wall or enter secretly, they will sneak up from behind, suddenly jump on the intruder's back, and use their long and sharp claws to firmly grasp the area below the shoulder blades, which makes it impossible for the person being grabbed to reach them with their hands and throw them off. If someone tries to do this, they will growl and bite fiercely with their sharp teeth.

The eyes of Siamese cats are usually blue, but when they are angry, they turn blood red, and their faces also turn red. This seems to be a psychological weapon that has the effect of frightening the enemy. In the remote areas of Siam, it is also common to use cats instead of dogs, and criminals avoid them in the same way. The reputation of Siamese cats is based on facts. In ancient times, Siamese soldiers brought cats to the battlefield as military dogs.

The private lives of Siamese cats are very interesting. They are believers in monogamy. If given the opportunity, they will choose their own mates and remain faithful for life. The opposite-sex partner chosen by kittens in their youth often never separates. When they reach maturity, they become a harmonious couple. If they are separated, they will become depressed and depressed.

Cat couples like to use the same bowl and eat together. However, during courtship, the male cat usually eats first, and the female cat waits by his side until he is full before quietly going up to eat the leftovers. But as soon as the cat wife is pregnant, all this changes completely. During the period when the female cat is pregnant and breastfeeding, the male cat always allows his wife to eat her fill. Only after the kittens are weaned does the cat husband regain his priority.

Because Siamese cats have the characteristic of catching thieves, they have become a special product of Siam, so some foreign tourists inevitably want to buy one or two and take them back to their country, and they all choose cats with tails that are knotted and curved, because it is said that this kind of cat is a genuine royal cat. The natives who sell cats also always say that their cats were stolen from the palace. In fact, stealing royal cats is a capital crime. Who would want to commit a serious crime for the sake of earning a small amount of money? However, the fact that a curved tail is a characteristic of royal cats has a story that has been passed down by word of mouth:

It is said that in ancient times, a Siamese king went out to fight in a war. Before leaving, he took off his magic ring and gave it to his queen to keep, telling her to put it in a safe place to prevent it from being lost or stolen.

After he went on the expedition, the queen put the magic ring on the tail of her beloved cat, because she thought it was the safest place. In order to prevent the ring from slipping off, she tied a knot on the cat's tail. So, this knot became permanent, and the descendants of this queen's beloved royal cat inherited this special deformity and became the symbol of the royal cat.

To put it bluntly, cats will never have knotted tails for generations just because their ancestors' tails were accidentally knotted. Cats with knotted and curved tails are not very rare, and the reason for their formation is not mysterious. However, it is because the position of their tail vertebrae is slightly different from that of ordinary cats.

### Flower Deity Lantern

Today is the twelfth day of the second month of the old lunar calendar, which is the birthday of all flowers.

Flower Deity Lanterns, commonly known as Liangsan Lanterns (cool umbrella lanterns), are seasonal objects for celebrating the birthday of all flowers in old Shanghai. The lanterns are made of a type of paper called "Tan Jian," but it looks even finer than silk. They are intricately carved with figures, flowers, precious birds, and exotic animals, making them exceptionally delicate and lifelike. The lanterns are round or hexagonal, with tassels and fringes on the corners and lower ends. When displaying the lanterns, they are accompanied by a Shifan (ten categories) percussion ensemble, slender waist drums, and paper-made flower branches and baskets. Sometimes, there are also platform displays, making it quite lively.

In other places, lantern markets are generally held during the Lantern Festival. In Shanghai, in addition to the Lantern Festival lantern market, the Flower Festival lantern market is also quite lively and particularly appreciated by literati and scholars. They find the Lantern Festival lanterns too vulgar and uninteresting, so they turn to value the Flower Deity Lanterns of the Flower Festival.

First, they prepare red and green flower buckets and use small silk scrolls to write the item names on them, tied with red silk. Various kinds of vegetables and shepherd's purse flowers are planted in them. When the banquet is in full swing, from the central palace onwards, each person uses a golden comb to pick from them. Empresses, imperial sons, noble princesses, and concubines, as well as all the chief eunuchs, receive rewards without penalties. Each bucket has ten numbers, with five red characters for rewards and five black characters for penalties. The highest rewards are complete sets of real pearls, jade cups, gold utensils, northern pearls, comb rings, beaded hair ornaments, and neck cloths. The next level includes silver ingots, wine vessels, crown hairpins, jade flowers, silk fabrics, ambergris, imperial calligraphy brushes and ink, and official kiln Ding ware. The penalties include dancing and singing, reciting poetry, chanting Buddhist scriptures, drinking cold water, and eating raw ginger, using these to create amusement. Royal palaces and noble residences also imitate this practice."

Xichao Lishi says: "On the second day of the second month, scholars and women all wear mugwort leaves." The saying goes: "Mugwort blooms before all herbs, wearing it keeps spring young."

Tian Rucheng's West Lake Travelogue says: "Flower Morning and Moon Evening are common sayings. The second and eighth months are the middle of spring and autumn, so the middle of the second month is the Flower Morning, and the middle of the eighth month is the Moon Evening."

Chengdu Zhi says: "The fifteenth day of the second month is the Flower Morning, for butterfly-catching gatherings. People of Shu also sell silkworms in the market on this day, indulging in music and sightseeing, calling it the Silkworm Market."

### Shanghai Old Tales, Part Four: A Brief History of the Garden Bridge

— Jizhai

From the western and central districts to the Hongkou and Tilanqiao areas, the Garden Bridge is not the only necessary route, but among all the bridges over the Suzhou Creek, the Garden Bridge is undoubtedly the most solid and magnificent in construction, and it also bears the most significant transportation responsibility. The name "Garden Bridge" (外白渡橋) is speculated to be a phonetic corruption of "Outer Ferry Bridge" (外擺渡橋). Because when bridges were not yet built over the Suzhou Creek, people relied on ferries to cross between the two banks, and there were many ferry crossings along the river. The place closest to the Bund was called "Outer Ferry," so the bridge built there was naturally called the Outer Ferry Bridge, which is also reasonable. However, when this bridge was first built, pedestrians, carriages, and horses had to pay to cross, just like paying for a ferry ride. Later, the bridge was taken over by the public and no longer charged a toll, which effectively turned it into a "free ferry" (白渡). Therefore, calling it the "White Ferry Bridge" (白渡橋) is indeed fitting.

Research shows that the construction of the Garden Bridge began in 1853, the third year of the Xianfeng reign. At that time, an Englishman named Wills saw the frequent traffic of carriages, horses, and pedestrians on the west bank of the Suzhou Creek and thought it was a profitable business. He obtained permission from the Shanghai Daotai (local official) and the concession authorities to organize a "Wills Bridge Company" and build a large bridge there. It was completed in 1856 (the sixth year of the Xianfeng reign) and named Wills Bridge. This was the predecessor of the Garden Bridge.

This bridge was, of course, built with wooden planks. In addition to the bridge piers on both sides, there was a drawbridge in the middle. When ships passed, the drawbridge was raised, and after they passed, it was lowered to allow pedestrians, carriages, and horses to cross.

It is said that Wills spent 10,000 taels of silver to build this bridge, which was a considerable amount at the time. Of course, he wanted to recoup his investment, so he charged each person two cash coins each time they crossed, with carriages and horses paying double. However, some people at the time noticed that foreigners with high noses were not charged, which caused great dissatisfaction. In the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign, i.e., 1872, this newspaper was founded, and several short articles commented on this unfair fact. They can still be found in today's archives. In order to resist the foreigners' injustice, the various public offices prepared to purchase several charitable ferries to provide free passage for Chinese people, to see if the Garden Bridge would still have any business. Seeing the situation was not good, the Municipal Council had to make a compromise, saying: Foreigners have always paid, and even more, at ten cash coins each time. However, because foreigners are not accustomed to carrying loose change when they go out, this money is collected by the Municipal Council at the end of the month, they said. Whether this was true or false could not be verified.

In any case, due to the establishment of the charitable ferries, the business of Wills Bridge greatly declined. In the thirteenth year of the Tongzhi reign (1874), the Municipal Council finally bought it for a price.

However, a wooden bridge, used for so many years, certainly needed repair urgently. The Municipal Council, recognizing the increasing importance of the bridge, decided to replace the bridge piers and rebuild a steel bridge. This matter was overseen by Main, the director of the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council at the time. In order to accurately calculate the load-bearing capacity of the bridge deck, Main sent many people to sit guard at both ends of the bridge all day long on June 14, 15, and 16 in the fifteenth year of the Guangxu reign (1889), carefully counting the number of carriages, horses, and pedestrians passing by. According to the later announcement, it was as follows:

Carriages　16,333

Rickshaws　20,958

Freight Cars　22

Small Carts　2,759

Sedan Chairs　27

Horses　38

Western Pedestrians　1,645

Chinese Pedestrians　33,666

The above statistics may not be completely accurate, but they must be close. From this, one can imagine what the traffic situation on the Garden Bridge was like at that time. The reconstruction of the Garden Bridge officially began in the thirty-second year of the Guangxu reign (1906) and was completed the following year. The bridge body is entirely made of steel, manufactured by the Cleveland Bridge & Engineering Company in England. For nearly forty years, although there have been occasional minor repairs, it has remained largely unchanged. Last year, due to the long-term pressure of the Broadway Mansions on the eastern pier foundation, a gap developed between it and the bridge body, which was repaired by the Public Works Bureau.
