### Third-Party Representatives Arrive in Beijing from Peiping to Fully Promote the Success of Peace Talks, Formal Negotiations Postponed to Begin on the 8th

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] During the peace talks in Peiping, representatives of third-party individuals have arrived in Nanjing from Peiping to convey their opinions to Acting President Li and are determined to do their utmost to promote the success of the peace talks. These two representatives of third-party individuals, accompanied by one staff member, flew from Peiping by special plane to Nanjing on the evening of the 5th. They were accompanied by Liu Zhongrong (not Liu Zhonghua. Liu Zhonghua is an advisor to the government delegation, while Liu Zhongrong was formerly the secretary of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association and had long been in Peiping; this time he was ordered to return to Nanjing) from the government side. However, due to various reasons, reporters are unable to disclose their names. After disembarking, the representatives immediately met with Acting President Li, personally delivering replies from Li Jishen, Zhang Bojun, Zhang Lan, and others to Acting President Li, and explaining the third-party's opinions in support of the success of the peace talks. Acting President Li immediately telegraphed Premier He Yingqin to come to the official residence to participate in the discussions. In the afternoon of the 6th, the two representatives went out to visit relevant individuals and deliver letters from Li, Zhang, Zhang, etc. It is reported that these representatives of third-party individuals will stay in Nanjing for several days, and the date of their return to Peiping is undetermined.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] According to traditionally reliable sources: after the peace talks in Peiping began on the morning of the 5th, because neither side had put forward a plan during the representatives' meeting, there were considerable technical problems in the negotiations. After consultation, the two sides agreed to jointly formulate steps for the peace talks to proceed, and rescheduled the formal commencement to the 8th. On the 5th and 6th, the representatives of both sides maintained close contact and studied negotiation steps that both sides could agree on, so that formal negotiations could begin on the 8th. The atmosphere was extremely harmonious when the representatives of both sides met.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] The government is closely monitoring reports about the progress of the peace talks in Peiping. Since the government's peace delegation flew to Peiping, little news has come from Peiping. However, this issue is clearly of greatest concern to the people of the whole country. Presidential Palace spokesman, Second Bureau Director Huang Xuecun, and Executive Yuan spokesman Bao Jing'an discussed this matter on the 6th. In order to avoid affecting the peace talks, it was immediately decided to telegraph the government representatives in Peiping to agree with the CCP on what could be published regarding the daily progress of negotiations, and then telegraph it to Nanjing for publication.

[Our Hankou Dispatch of the 6th] Huang Qihan, who had just returned to Beijing from Peiping, flew to Hankou yesterday afternoon and immediately visited Bai Chongxi to report. Huang was visited by reporters from various local newspapers after leaving headquarters on the morning of the 6th, but they have not been able to meet him as of tonight.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] Regarding the rumored "final ultimatum" from the CCP demanding the government surrender, after reporters inquired in all directions, no official denial or confirmation could be obtained. It is generally believed that this rumor may have arisen from the arrival of third-party representatives in Nanjing or the New China News Agency's editorial broadcast on the evening of the 6th demanding the government surrender to the people. Official circles in Nanjing are quiet as usual, still confident in the peace talks, and there are no signs of unease after receiving the "final ultimatum."

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] Authoritative sources claimed today: the CCP has issued a final ultimatum demanding the government's actual surrender. The CCP proposes that a joint committee be established before Saturday of this week to supervise the transfer of Kuomintang troops to the CCP's command within three days. After this final ultimatum was issued, it was heard that Acting President Li had notified diplomatic representatives of Western countries, saying that the CCP army may cross the river within ten days.

### Peace Talk Representative Li Zheng Will Return to Nanjing to Investigate the Truth of the April 1st Incident; The Executive Yuan Denies that the Case Will Impact the Peace Talks; Luo Chunbo and Others Go to Various Schools to Investigate the Facts

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] It is heard that government peace talk representative Li Zheng will soon return to Nanjing from Peiping. His mission is to investigate the truth of the April 1st incident. He will not stay in Nanjing for long and will still go to Peiping.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] Executive Yuan spokesman Bao Jing'an solemnly denied to reporters on the 6th that the peace talks had encountered complications due to the Nanjing April 1st incident. Bao said: the peace talks are progressing smoothly. Some newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai reported on the 6th that the peace talks had encountered complications because of the April 1st incident, making it impossible to start the peace talks. However, according to reporters, after the peace talks officially began on the 5th, the reason for the postponement was that both sides' preparations were not sufficient. This postponement has nothing to do with the April 1st incident. Officials absolutely deny to reporters the impact of the April 1st incident on the peace talks.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] Luo Chunbo, director of the Political Warfare Department of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, and Shen Shaolun, member of the Ministry of Education's Educational Research Council, were assigned to investigate the truth of the April 1st incident. On the afternoon of the 6th, they went to Jinling University, Central University, National Chengchi University, the Drama College, and the Officers' Reception General Team. On the one hand, they investigated the actual situation of the April 1st incident; on the other hand, they consoled the teachers, students, and officers of each school. According to Director Luo after returning from the investigation: more than 8,000 officers have been discharged from the Officers' Reception Team, and 80 percent of them have already been dismissed or assigned to leave the team.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] The "Aftermath Handling Committee of the April 1st Bloodshed Incident" organized by college students in Nanjing, published a "Letter to the National Compatriots Again" on the 6th, demanding that the masterminds of the bloodshed incident be removed from their posts and investigated, that the bodies of dead students and school employees and missing workers be returned, that all losses be compensated, and that people's freedom and safety be guaranteed.

### Xiamen University Students on Strike for Three Days

[Our Xiamen Dispatch of the 6th] After the April 1st incident, Xiamen University students decided to go on strike for three days starting from the 7th, sending telegrams to the government to severely punish the perpetrators, and sending telegrams to console the injured classmates.

### The CCP Wants the Government to Surrender to the "People"

[Our Dispatch] Last night, after "Where is the Nanjing Government Going?", the CCP radio broadcast another New China News Agency editorial, "Demanding the Nanjing Government Surrender to the People." The article stated that the Kuomintang government should be held responsible for the war disaster suffered by the Chinese people in recent years, and all important responsible party, government, and military personnel should also bear responsibility according to the severity of the circumstances. If the government's civil and military officials can "recognize right and wrong, repent sincerely, act out of true sincerity, and have concrete actions that are conducive to the advancement of the people's liberation cause and the peaceful resolution of domestic problems, regardless of who they are, they are welcome." Otherwise, the people will absolutely not forgive their crimes, and they will not escape the people's trial and punishment. The commentary pointed out that Fu Zuoyi, with an "honest attitude," has begun to take "meritorious service to redeem his sins." Although there are also those in the government who hope to participate in the peaceful resolution of domestic problems, they are still continuing to associate with the pro-war Jiang and oppose the advancement of the CCP army, oppose accepting the CCP's eight conditions, oppose surrender, and advocate equal and glorious peace. The adoption of this attitude is actually due to the refusal to hand over war criminals to the people for punishment, the refusal to reorganize the army, the refusal to be taken over by the government, and even the demand to restore the status of the old Political Consultative Conference era, demanding an unconditional ceasefire on the spot, and demanding that the CCP army not enter south of the Yangtze River to liberate 200 million oppressed compatriots. Its purpose is to seek to preserve its power as capital for a comeback.

### A Rift Has Developed Between Democrats and Liberals and the CCP; CCP Figures Live in Luxury in the Best Hotels; Li Jishen Is Dwarfed and Only Gets a Small Room

[United Press Hong Kong Dispatch of the 6th] Chinese separatists went from Hong Kong to Peiping to participate in peace talks, but the result may be that they will not participate. According to the "China Mail": leaders of democratic and liberal factions wrote from Peiping saying: a rift has developed between these factions and the CCP, so they may not be invited to participate in the peace talks. The CCP has taken over the best residences and hotels, while second-class hotels are provided to the leaders of the Democratic League and the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee. Li Jishen, the leader of the Revolutionary Committee, only got one room in the Peiping International Hotel.

The commentary pointed out that "between reactionary war criminals who sell out the country and the revolutionary people, there is absolutely no allowance for equality," and also said that since Japan's surrender, the Kuomintang government, with the support of the United States, has repeatedly rejected peace, so this debt of blood, even if "ten thousand deaths are not enough to atone for their crimes." Now, the CCP allows meritorious service to redeem sins under eight conditions, which is a generous policy of "what great imperial grace." The conclusion of the article is that war criminals cannot demand glory, and should surrender politically to the people, and hand over their weapons.

### Government Expenditures This Month Will Reach 800 Billion Yuan

### Joint Meeting of Three Committees of the Legislative Yuan; Xu Yongchang and Gu Zhutong Report on Military Reorganization Plan; The Number of National Troops Cannot Be Reduced Further from 4.2 Million; Liu Gongyun Says That It Is Impossible to Afford to Pay Salaries in Silver Dollars

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] The Legislative Yuan's National Defense Budget and Finance and Banking Three-Committee held a joint meeting on the morning of the 6th to discuss the proposal submitted by committee member Wang Guangqing and others "requesting the government to quickly determine a military reorganization plan, reduce the number of troops, tighten expenditures, verify salary payments, and reduce non-combat personnel to save national funds." More than 160 committee members attended, and Minister of National Defense Xu Yongchang, Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun, Vice Minister of National Defense Xiao Yisu, and others were invited to attend. Committee member Wang Zemin presided. First, Xu Yongchang and Gu Zhutong were asked to report on the military reorganization plan. In addition to explaining the main points of the military reorganization, Xu and Gu both stated that the minimum number of national troops was 4.2 million and could not be reduced further, but in order to improve the treatment of soldiers and boost morale, soldiers' treatment was still hoped to be paid in silver dollars according to the previously planned plan. The Ministry of National Defense has now determined that each soldier will be paid two silver dollars, and the remainder will be paid in gold yuan according to the market price of silver dollars. Then, Liu Gongyun reported on the financial situation. Liu said that if the military's treatment was all paid in silver dollars, 90 million silver dollars would be needed each month. If civil servants also requested to be paid in silver dollars as an example, another 30 million silver dollars would be needed, totaling 120 million silver dollars. The Ministry of Finance really cannot afford this, and it is also beyond the mint's manufacturing capacity. The current mint's capacity is only to produce 10 million silver dollars per month, so the matter of paying soldiers in silver dollars may not be fully realized. Because the minimum amount of silver dollars to be paid to soldiers is 60 million, this is quite difficult for the Ministry of Finance to handle. After Xu, Gu, Liu, and others finished their reports, the legislators asked questions. Wang Hongshao spoke, believing that military reorganization should take into account financial resources, and should improve the treatment of officers and soldiers and adopt a policy of elite troops. Ge Jingen believed that the Legislative Yuan did not need to discuss the number of troops, but should approve the budget. Bai Jianmin believed that military reorganization should be reasonable, rational, and legal. Zou Shuwen asked whether the reduction of troops contradicted the conscription. Jia Chengzhang advocated paying salaries by name and reducing non-combat personnel as much as possible, and also advocated that the Ministry of National Defense should join the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans to organize an inspection tour. Yu Zheng said that military reorganization is not troop reduction, and should seek refinement and practicality. Lei Yin said that there were too many service soldiers in the troops. Yu Ruzhou believed that military discipline should be rectified. Jiang Yiping hoped that the military authorities would work with the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans and other public opinion institutions to do verification work. There were also Bao Huaguo and many others who spoke, and the various leaders answered the various questions raised. The final resolution was "please ask the Ministry of National Defense to adopt the opinions of the committee members as much as possible, and to organize the military reorganization plan, together with the Ministry of National Defense's organizational law and the army, navy, and air force establishment, and send it to the Legislative Yuan for discussion in the shortest possible time."

### Sun Yueqi Reports on the Economy at the Legislative Yuan's Economic Committee

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] The Legislative Yuan's Economic and Resources Committee held a full committee meeting at 3:00 p.m. on the 6th.

Minister of Economic Affairs Sun Yueqi, Vice Ministers Jian Guansan and Zhang Liling, and Vice Chairman of the Resources Committee Wu Zhaohong were all in attendance. At the meeting, Minister Sun was heard to report on the policy direction. Sun explained in detail on three points: (1) the basic spirit of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' policy direction; (2) increasing the necessary domestic agricultural and industrial production; (3) reducing unnecessary restrictions on agriculture, industry, and commerce. Finally, he pointed out that the past policy of controlling economic policy with financial policy will be corrected in the future. After Sun finished his report, more than ten legislators, including Ge Jingen, Dong Yinzhang, Wang Lihang, and Wu Wangji, spoke, making suggestions and raising questions about economic policy. Dong and others mostly advocated abolishing the Transportation Control Committee to facilitate the normal development of industry and commerce. Sun is scheduled to attend the Economic and Resources Committee again on the afternoon of the 7th to give a reply.

As most of the personnel of this hospital have already come to Guangzhou, all government affairs and handover matters need to be handled, so I am making a special trip to Guangzhou to visit the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Committees and comrades of the Central Committee of our party to exchange views on national affairs. However, the heads of various departments of the Executive Yuan are all in Nanjing, and the Executive Yuan's political affairs meetings are also held in Beijing, so I will only delay for a few days here and must return to Beijing. Guangzhou is the source of the revolution. It has been more than four years since Yingqin came here for the surrender in 1945. Coming here again this time is full of mixed feelings."

### The Situation in Yizheng is Tense Again; The CCP Army on the West Side of the Jinpu Railway Attacks Jiangpu

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 6th] Reliable news: after the situation in Yizheng stabilized on the 5th, it suddenly became tense again on the 6th. At dawn, the CCP's Eighth Column (now reorganized into the 26th Army), led by Zhang Mingchu with more than 3,000 troops, opened to the Xupuqiao Town, an important bridgehead north of the city, via Chuzhou and Liuhe. Its advance troops have approached the Lamyiao stronghold, which was recovered by the garrison on the 5th. The CCP army is now distributed two or three li outside the city to build trenches. A major contact will occur in the area within one or two days. County Magistrate Zuo Zhiren has urgently telegraphed the province and the Second Fleet of the Navy stationed in Zhenjiang, asking them to send elite troops and fleets overnight to increase defense in order to ensure this isolated city in northern Jiangsu.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 6th] About one battalion of artillery from an unidentified CCP army, with more than 20 artillery pieces, arrived at Qijiaxiang, 20 li north of Sanjiangying in Zhenjiang on the 4th, with unknown intentions.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] On the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, between Puzhen and Flag Camp, the situation was still calm on the 6th. However, more than 1,000 CCP troops in Quanxiao, on the west side of the railway, suddenly attacked Jiangpu City on the night of the 5th. In order to concentrate their forces, the National Army automatically abandoned outposts such as Ma'anshan, Wolongshan, and Xiaoma Mountain. The war has moved to the vicinity of the city's suburbs. By the morning of the 6th, after the air force was dispatched to assist in the battle, the CCP army was finally forced to retreat.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 6th] It is reported that the main force of Chen Yi's Fourth Columns, including the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th Columns, has indeed begun to withdraw from the Jing, Tai, Yang, and Tong areas north of the Yangtze River and move to the southern section of the Jinpu Railway, but its intentions cannot yet be determined.

### The Anqing Battle Turns Quiet; Communist Army's Renewed Offensive Again Smashed; Huayuan on the Pinghan Line Automatically Abandoned

[Our Wuhu Dispatch, 6th] The Anqing battle has become quieter since the morning of the 6th. The offensive launched by the Communist army since the night of the 4th, after two nights and a day of fierce fighting, was completely crushed by the Nationalist army before dawn on the 6th. The Communist army suffered more than 4,000 casualties. Today, the battle has gradually turned quiet. According to military judgment, unless the Communist army makes further reinforcements, it will have no power to commit further offenses. The Nationalist army is still firmly defending its original position.

[Our Jiujiang Dispatch, 6th] The Anqing front was quiet all day on the 6th. According to observations by relevant parties, the Communist army may be making other deployments. The Nationalist army advanced its troops in the eastern suburbs of the city by another 1,000 meters yesterday afternoon. Its outposts are about ten li from the urban area. There were no changes on the northern, southern, and western fronts. According to military statistics, since the Communist army began attacking Anqing on the 23rd of last month, casualties up to the 5th of this month are close to 20,000. The ratio of Communist to Nationalist army casualties is two to one, and the ratio of troop strength is five to one. According to intelligence estimates, the invading Communist army may maintain a force of 50,000, while the Nationalist army only reaches one-fifth of that number. This proves that the troops participating in this battle are highly morale, and the cooperation between the army, navy, and air force has achieved great results. As for the Communist army's claim to cross the Yangtze River at Wuxue Tianjia Town, the military here judges that the Communist army probably has no such intention at present.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Military News Agency: After the Anqing garrison repelled the Communist army's fierce offensive on the night of the 4th with army-navy coordination, it recovered the Wulimiao area five miles east of Anqing and the Taihu Dam in one fell swoop, killing and wounding more than 1,000 Communist soldiers and capturing more than 100 Communist soldiers. The Nationalist army also suffered more than 100 casualties. In addition, a unit of the Communist army, traveling on six wooden boats, launched a sneak attack on the garrison at Heihe Island (near Digang north of Fanchang) at 2:00 AM on the 6th. After half an hour of fighting, the Communist army was defeated and retreated.

[Our Xiaogan Dispatch, 6th] In order to consolidate the security of the periphery of Wuhan and strengthen the river defense, the Nationalist army in the southern section of Pinghan has continued to actively retreat southward in recent days and has now withdrawn to the vicinity of Xiaojia Village north of Xiaogan to block the Communist army continuing to invade southward.

[Our Xiaogan Dispatch, 6th] Military News: Because the flanks and front of the Xiaogan position have become stable, the Nationalist army continued to abandon Huayuan on the 5th. According to news from the morning of the 6th, two regiments of the Communist 10th Column entered the area five li east of Huayuan Town on the 5th. The railroad bridges and beams at the north and south ends of Huayuan were slightly damaged, and the station became a vacuum zone.

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 6th] Today, there was no major contact between the Nationalist and Communist armies along the Pinghan Line and on both sides. The Communist army descending south from Luoshan in the east of the line is still advancing rapidly towards the line from Hekou east of Huayuan to Zhangcheling. The Communist army and most of the 10th Column in the west of the line have retreated to Anlu. More than 3,000 casualties from the Communist army on the west bank of the Huan River west of Huayuan have been concentrated in Anle City for treatment after three days and nights of stretcher transport.

### Editorial: The United Nations General Assembly and the Atlantic Pact

Just as the East and West are engaged in a fierce Cold War over the signing of the Atlantic Pact, the United Nations General Assembly has opened on the shores of Lake Success, attempting to resolve the world's current major problems in a peaceful manner. To people of all countries who yearn for world peace, it is a gratifying event, and they place earnest hopes on this General Assembly. Even the representatives of various countries attending the General Assembly could not help but applaud warmly at the scene of US Representative Acheson and Soviet Representative Gromyko shaking hands and making peace, which is enough to prove that the desire for world peace is a common psychology of people around the world. The future of world peace seems bright and straightforward. However, in order to sign the Atlantic Pact, the Soviet Union had already launched its propaganda war, doing its utmost to attack the United Kingdom and the United States for attempting to launch a new international war, and had separately notified the seven Western countries, denouncing them as violating international agreements and showing aggressiveness. Even its vassal states were willing to be the tail of the Soviet Union, standing beside the Soviet Union, waving flags and shouting, and also strongly criticized the Atlantic Pact for having the smell of gunpowder. Now that the United Nations General Assembly is meeting on the shores of Lake Success, the Soviet representative will not let go of this good opportunity and remain silent. Therefore, we predict that this United Nations General Assembly will publicly discuss whether the Atlantic Pact violates the United Nations Charter. At that time, the Cold War between the East and West will inevitably become more intense, and whether the United Nations can safely overcome this serious test has become a major question.

The evaluation of the Atlantic Pact has become a matter of international right and wrong today. Summarizing the opinions of various Soviet newspapers, magazines, and telegrams, the signing of the Atlantic Pact is sufficient to lead to a new international war. The reasons are three: (1) The Atlantic Pact has an open aggressive nature and is aimed at the Soviet Union; (2) It violates the United Nations Charter; (3) It undermines the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet Treaties of Friendship, the Yalta Agreement, and the Potsdam Agreement. On the British and American side, they strongly stated that the Atlantic Pact is a regional security system aimed at defending against aggression. When President Truman gave a speech at the signing ceremony of the Atlantic Pact, he stated that "Today's ceremony is historic, and its purpose is to enable this international treaty to fulfill its task of protecting the security and prosperity of the signatory countries. What we have signed is a "good neighbor agreement." The signatory countries are willing to abide by the peaceful principles of the United Nations organization, live in friendship with all countries, and implement economic mutual assistance. In the future, if the territory or independence of any signatory country is threatened, they will discuss ways to deal with it and provide assistance to the victim of aggression."

Standing from a third-party position, we can say that we see this international right and wrong more clearly than anyone else. But from the perspective of cause and effect, it is quite a "chicken lays an egg, an egg hatches a chicken" mystery. Why do we say this? The signing of the Atlantic Pact is sufficient to create international fortifications, deepen the division of the two worlds in the East and West, and lead mankind to the path of war, and it is indeed possible to create these consequences. The accusations made by the Soviet side also have their reasons in theory. But we want to ask why the United Kingdom and the United States want to conclude the Atlantic Pact? After the end of World War II, who did not yearn for the ideal of one world, who did not hope for the successful creation of world peace? In particular, the diplomatic policies of the United Kingdom and the United States made every effort to move towards this goal, and tried every means to promote international understanding and cooperation in order to seek the joint efforts of the wartime allies to create peace. The repeated convening of foreign ministers' meetings and the regular holding of the United Nations General Assembly were aimed at promoting world unity and resolving international issues through peaceful means. However, for three or four years, things went against expectations. The international undertow surged. Because of differences in ideology and conflicts of interest, not only was the ideal of one world not realized, but the Cold War intensified, making the postwar world even more distant from true peace. President Truman and Prime Minister Atlee, although they made great efforts to seek understanding with the Soviet Union, the Cold War spread from Europe to Asia, almost covering the entire globe, putting the world, which had suffered from war, to a moment of shock again. The United Kingdom and the United States have sufficient reasons to conclude the Atlantic Pact, which is defensive in nature, in order to ensure the peace and security of the North Atlantic, which no one can oppose. The Soviet Union's protest is inevitably too subjective and easily reminds people of Nazi Germany on the eve of World War II, which repeatedly accused the United Kingdom and France of adopting an encirclement policy against Germany, and now history is repeating itself.

However, in order to ensure our own security and peace, we should take a "non-intervention" attitude towards this international right and wrong, so as not to be swept into the vortex of international right and wrong. Indian Prime Minister Nehru's statement on the Atlantic Pact stated that India is not in the North Atlantic region, so it is not interested in this pact; at the same time, he solemnly stated India's determination to stay out of international political groups. This attitude can be described as the most sensible. We hope that China also has a clear understanding.

After the opening of the United Nations General Assembly, it will proceed according to the agenda and publicly discuss this issue. The Soviet Union can once again use this matter to scold the United States as a "warmonger," which may cause a great uproar on Lake Success. Standing on the principle of international peace first, we hope that the representatives of both East and West can sit down calmly, and with a spirit of mutual trust, mutual tolerance, and mutual concession, explore a broad road for world peace. Do not act impulsively and break faces for the sake of the Atlantic Pact, causing the newly born United Nations to suffer the fate of the old League of Nations.

### Taiwan Garrison Command Surrounds NTU Dormitories and Teachers College; Orders Surrender of Twenty Students Conspiring to Disrupt; Fu Sinian Demands Bail for Arrested Students Be Handled by the Court

[Our Taipei Dispatch, 6th] The Garrison Command surrounded both the NTU dormitories on Xinsheng South Road and Gongyuan Road, as well as the Teachers College on Heping East Road at around 1:00 AM on the 6th, banning traffic and announcing martial law, which has not been lifted as of 5:00 PM. Reporters interviewed relevant authorities and NTU President Fu Sinian separately, but they were silent on the matter. According to an official announcement, it was reported that twenty students from NTU and Teachers College were the masterminds behind posting slogans, distributing leaflets, inciting the people, endangering public security, and even smashing public offices and detaining public officials, with ulterior motives. On the evening of the 5th, they gathered to discuss plans to expand the disturbance. In order to maintain social order, the authorities telegraphed the administrations of the two schools to arrest the students and interrogate them according to the law, etc.

List of Twenty

The list includes Cao Qian, Chen Shi, Xu Huajiang, Zhou Ziqiang, Zhu Guangquan, Lu Xiuru, Sun Daren, Lin Huolian, Xu Yixi, Wang Yaohua, Wang Huimin, Jian Wenxuan, Chen Qin, and Song Chengzhi from NTU, and Zhou Shenyuan, Zheng Hongxi, Zhuang Huizhang, Fang Qiming, Zhao Zhiyang, and Zhu Shangyi from Teachers College. NTU President Fu Sinian led three student representatives to the Garrison Command in the morning to meet with Deputy Commander Peng. The Garrison Command hoped that Fu would voluntarily hand over the NTU students listed on the list, and then martial law could be lifted. Fu stated that he had no authority to do so and requested the Garrison Command for (1) bail for the arrested students by the school, and (2) that the case be transferred to the court for handling. However, when the reporter interviewed Fu, he asked whether the students had been arrested, and Fu replied that he did not know. NTU and Teachers College were suspended. Chen Cheng convened a meeting at the Garrison Command at 4:00 PM, gathering the heads of public security in the city and the presidents of NTU and Teachers College to discuss the matter.

### Davis, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration in North China, Said That Grain Prices in the Suburbs of Beiping Are Higher Than in the City; Rural Rents and Taxes Are Extremely Heavy

[Our News] Davis, Director of the North China Office of the Economic Cooperation Administration, held a reception for reporters yesterday after returning to Shanghai and expressed his views on Beiping under the rule of the Chinese Communist Party. He said: The supply of food in Beiping is very sufficient. Although rice prices have risen by 70-80% in two months, they are lower when priced in US dollars. However, just twenty miles outside the suburbs, grain prices are about twice as high as in the city. This may be due to the fact that the Chinese Communist Party's trading companies are exchanging kerosene for food in rural areas to supply cities, hence this peculiar phenomenon. Rural rents and taxes are extremely heavy, with an average tax rate of about 60%, so farmers are gradually complaining. The Chinese Communist Party authorities are extremely worried about the possibility of Kuomintang underground activities. The newspapers publish daily warnings to former Kuomintang secret agents, urging them to lay down their weapons and surrender as soon as possible. Davis also said that after the Chinese Communist Party took over Beiping, he met and chatted with a National Army officer and learned that these National Army troops were stationed outside the city, the organization had not changed, all equipment was maintained, and liaison officers were set up above the squad level. The officers all said that they were cooperating rather than surrendering. According to Davis's personal observations, in fact, the actions of the National Army did not consider themselves as defeated troops.

Regarding the general situation in Beiping, Davis said that the Chinese Communist Party personnel have good discipline and are diligent in learning, but they are suffering from a lack of experience and sometimes cannot help but be foolish. Students in Beiping eat millet every day, and the allocation is also low, but they are enthusiastically supporting the new regime and also express that they are quite happy. The reason is that the Chinese Communist Party is good at pleasing students in the newspapers and making these young people feel their own importance. The Chinese Communist Party has a branch of the Southward Work Corps in Ping, with 800 students. Since March, the original plan was to complete the training in four months, but now it has been reduced to two months. The attitude of the students cannot represent the general mood of the residents of Beiping. Signs of opposition have begun to be discovered. Street slogans supporting the Communist Party are often defaced at night. Criminal cases in Beiping, especially murder cases, have increased recently, and the Communist Party's precautions have become more strict as a result, with three people at each post.

### Ding Zhipan Arrives in Cheng from Chang to Inspect Civil Training and River Defense

### Central Government Attaches Importance to Yunnan Banditry; Orders Five Provinces to Jointly Defend and Suppress

Two divisions of Sichuan troops have been transferred to strengthen the defense of Yunnan and Guizhou and are now stationed in Weining and Bijie.

[Our Guiyang Dispatch, 6th] The bandits Zhang Tianlu and Zhuang Yan, who infiltrated Xingyi County, have become increasingly rampant by using the slogan "People's freedom to grow opium." The government is only firmly defending the county seat, a small place. After He Shaozhou, commander of the Sixth Training Command, arrived from Kunming with reinforcements (said to be modern equipment, equivalent to a regiment), there may be a turning point. Han Wenhuan, deputy commander of the Provincial Security Command, is scheduled to go to the counties in southwestern Guizhou on April 15 to inspect and supervise the suppression.

### UN General Assembly President Urges Cooperation Among Major Powers to Seek World Peace; General Committee Discusses the Case of Ill-Treatment of Clergy in Hungary and Bulgaria; A Heated Debate Erupts; Acheson and Bevin Returned to Washington Yesterday

[Report from Our Agency] Lake Success, New York, Radio Broadcast, 6th: The General Committee of the UN General Assembly, consisting of fourteen nations, met on the 6th to discuss the case of Hungary and Bulgaria's ill-treatment of Cardinal Mindszenty and other church leaders. Representatives from Australia and Bolivia proposed that the General Assembly investigate the truth of the case. The Polish representative, Katz-Suchy, immediately launched a fierce attack, accusing the United Nations of having no right to interfere in Hungary and Bulgaria's internal affairs. He said that if the case were placed on the agenda, it would conflict with the UN Charter. Katz-Suchy said that if Hungary and Bulgaria had violated treaty provisions, this matter should first be considered by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. U.S. Representative Austin suggested that the General Committee examine the actions of Hungary and Bulgaria from the perspective of religious freedom and human rights. Katz-Suchy expressed opposition, saying that although the General Assembly opposed the Netherlands, the committee would be able to overcome the difficulties and decide to submit the case to the General Assembly for discussion.

[United Press, New York, 5th] The second session of the Third UN General Assembly opened yesterday at Flushing Meadow. The President of the Assembly, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, said in his opening speech that cooperation among the five major powers was essential. The current difficulties in the world were not caused by the UN organization, but by the discord among the major powers. He endorsed President Truman's call for resolute support of the UN organization. U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, in his address, assured that the United States and other signatories to the Atlantic Treaty would fully support the UN organization. Acheson first issued a statement to the press, strongly asserting that the American people firmly believed that the United Nations was the greatest hope for establishing a peaceful world society. When Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko entered the UN General Assembly Hall, he was cleared by police and UN security guards. Gromyko smiled and spoke in Russian to Soviet Ambassador to the United States Panyushkin, who followed him. Gromyko shook hands and exchanged greetings with Acheson before the meeting. Gromyko did not speak at the opening of the General Assembly, but it was expected that he would formally attack the North Atlantic Treaty.

The UN Plenary Assembly lasted only 30 minutes, and then the six standing committees of the Assembly met to hold re-elections to fill vacancies.

Both of the southern men headed for Washington.

### U.S., Britain, and France Continue to Discuss the Establishment of a West German Government; U.S. Military Commander in Germany to Be Succeeded by Clark

[United Press International, Washington, 6th] The foreign ministers of the Western three powers met here on the 6th to lay the foundation for the establishment of West Germany. According to diplomatic sources, Secretary of State Acheson, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Schuman will continue to meet at the State Department on the 7th and 8th, possibly longer. Informed sources say that the agenda includes the following two key points: (1) The economic and administrative merger of the French-occupied zone and the British and American-occupied zones in Germany within the next three months; (2) An agreement on the conditions of peace, specifying the powers to be granted to West Germany and the powers to be retained by the occupying countries, which will remain stationed in Germany indefinitely.

Since the three foreign ministers held discussions on March 31st, preparations for this meeting have been actively underway. Experts on German issues at the State Department have been working on documents and plans day and night. Experts from London and Paris have also been summoned for consultations. British officials said, "Regardless of Soviet opposition, the three powers are now determined to proceed with the establishment of West Germany." One of the issues to be discussed at this meeting is to determine how much power the United States should have in terms of West Germany's economic issues. Britain agrees that since the United States bears the majority of the occupation costs and reconstruction costs, it should have a decisive say on certain issues. However, they need to precisely define "economic issues" in order to retain their own powers in matters of particular concern to Britain. For example, Britain opposes further expansion of the German merchant fleet, while some American officials support this, believing it is necessary to make Germany self-sufficient. Furthermore, France is now trying to hold a greater degree of military control over the occupied zone than Britain and the United States consider appropriate.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] Reliable sources confirm that Lieutenant General Clark, commander of the Sixth Army, will be transferred to serve as the U.S. military commander in Germany to succeed Clay.

Stores, factories, and other industrial organizations will also celebrate U.S. Army Day. These industrial and commercial organizations closely cooperated with the U.S. Army during World War II. Secretary of Defense Johnson said in a special Army Day message that the U.S. Army "has made great contributions to the welfare of the United States in peacetime and has never disgraced its mission in wartime." Chief of Staff Bradley assured that the Army will support the ongoing unification plan of the armed forces under the leadership of Secretary of Defense Johnson.

Bradley said: "Because we recognize that the best role played by the Army is in the unified national defense plan, we are pleased to choose the following slogan for the 1949 Army Day: 'The U.S. Army—a part of the Department of Defense—is for security.'" Bradley said that this year is the 22nd week of commemorating Army Day, but he will recommend ending this Army Day. He continued: "If we can eliminate the competition caused by these festivals by canceling Army Day, Navy Day, and Air Force Day, then we may join hands in a single National Security Day." Secretary of the Navy Sullivan and Secretary of the Air Force Symington also issued statements praising the Army's mission in the last war.

General Clay, commander-in-chief of the U.S. armed forces in Europe, said in a message prepared to be delivered on Army Day that the Berlin Airlift has clearly demonstrated the unity of purpose and spirit of cooperation of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force.

Bradley Advocates Strengthening Western European Border Defenses; Past Conservative Military Strategies Should Be Abandoned

[United Press, New York, 5th] Army Chief of Staff Bradley delivered an important speech tonight, revealing some of the U.S. Army authorities' military strategy planning. Bradley advocated military assistance to Western Europe to prevent aggression from ravaging the European continent as early as possible. There is a prevailing idea that if the Soviet Union wants to occupy Europe, no one can stop it. The United States can only launch air strikes and then lead a counterattack to resolve the situation in Europe. Bradley does not agree, believing that this kind of military strategy will disappoint and demoralize the allies in Europe. With the authorization of the State Department, Bradley publicly expressed his views on the military significance of the North Atlantic Treaty, saying, "In terms of military strategy, this alliance allows the free nations of Europe and America to use American strength to strengthen the European defense line to deal with aggression. The current balance of power is concentrated 3,000 miles outside the heart of Europe, in the United States. The American people must understand that if our military strategy for Europe requires us to give up first and then allow us to liberate, then the allies in Europe cannot help us. If the balance of power in Europe depends on our bombers, and its reserve strength exists on the north shore of the Atlantic, then there is no other military strategy to speak of. This kind of military strategy will only demoralize the allies in wartime, and unless the common defense plan of the free world guarantees the security of Western Europe, it is impossible to expect the people of the allied countries to sacrifice their lives for communism. As far as I know, it is best to invest in Western European border defenses in a timely manner to create a sense of security." Bradley said that the North Atlantic Treaty is a document to ensure peace. The Soviet Union accused the treaty of being hostile, only to vent its anger for being blamed. After the treaty was established, the Cold War was no longer something to be feared. Free countries need not worry about not having help when resisting aggression. In short, the treaty is as important to American security as the atomic bomb. As a soldier, I do not want to discuss too much before the Senate discusses the treaty, but there is something I must say. The treaty is complementary to our country's military strength, and the American people should listen to the honest opinions of public servants. If Western Europe does not exist, the New World will be isolated."

[Agence France-Presse, Bad Kreuznach, 5th] General Collins, aide to Army Chief of Staff Bradley, declared here tonight: The main goal of the U.S. military is to organize a highly mobile combat force as soon as possible to prevent any eventuality. The team will consist of 5,000 people and can be used to quickly occupy enemy bases that bomb the United States once a war breaks out.

MacArthur Issues a Message to U.S. Troops in the Far East; U.S. Garrison in Tokyo Holds Review Ceremony

[United Press International, Tokyo, 6th] Allied forces and U.S. troops held a grand review at the Imperial Palace Plaza in Tokyo on U.S. Army Day. Major General Almond, Chief of Staff of the Allied Forces, accepted the salute of 1,500 people on behalf of MacArthur and read MacArthur's brief message. The planned air force flyover was canceled due to bad weather. Soviet representative to the Allied Council, Derevyanko, did not attend, only sending a minor official.

[New Asia, Tokyo, 6th] April 6th is U.S. Army Day. MacArthur issued a message to all officers and soldiers of the U.S. forces stationed in the Far East on the morning of the 6th, roughly stating: "U.S. officers and soldiers have established a tradition of honor and sacrifice through the history of combat and peace. This tradition has become a part of the American national tradition. I hope that you will further implement this ideal and fulfill your responsibilities. I am confident that you will not shy away from the mission that you are responsible for."

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 6th] Lieutenant General Walker, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in Japan, said in a broadcast to various parts of the Far East on the Army radio station here today: The next "Hitler" will attack the United States first, and will not make the mistake of attacking weak countries. Walker said that in the past two world wars, the invaders failed because they all made a big mistake, that is, they attacked weak countries first. This not only depleted their own strength but also gave the United States time to convert civilian industries into military industries. Walker continued, saying that the United States has never adopted a policy of being prepared for any eventuality. If this policy had been adopted earlier, both world wars might have been avoided. In addition, the American occupation forces here paraded on the streets today to celebrate U.S. Army Day.

As for the establishment of the Atlantic Pact, the Soviet Union should be satisfied, because if Europe cannot unite for one day, world peace cannot be truly achieved for one day.

### Pacific Pact May Be Signed This Autumn

Commonwealth Conference a Prelude to the Alliance Treaty

[United Press International, Ottawa, 5th] The Canadian government believes that the Commonwealth Conference in London is mainly a prelude to the Southwest Pacific regional security pact. According to reports from London, when Commonwealth politicians meet on April 21, the only issue that will require a major decision is the future national status of India. Diplomats here believe that once this issue is resolved, India will join forces with Australia, New Zealand, and other continental Asian countries to form a regional security pact under the United Nations. Canada's note to the Soviet Union on the 4th bluntly denied that the North Atlantic Treaty was an "aggressive pact," which is believed to be based on the legality of regional pacts under the United Nations Charter. Some suggest that the Pacific Pact may be signed this autumn. They say this will be the first major diplomatic offensive by democratic countries in Asia to prevent the Communist Party from controlling the Asian continent.

### U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Secret Meeting Discusses the North Atlantic Treaty; Truman to Formally Request Congressional Approval

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] The Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a 90-minute secret meeting today to discuss the North Atlantic Treaty. Committee Chairman Connally declined to reveal when the treaty would be submitted to the Senate for approval. President Truman is expected to submit both the North Atlantic Treaty and a supplemental military aid bill to Congress simultaneously after the military aid bill is finalized. The North Atlantic Treaty stipulates that it will only take effect after ratification by the seven founding nations: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. The U.S. Constitution requires a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate to ratify treaties with foreign countries. While the treaty does not require approval from the House of Representatives, the supplemental military aid bill does. Military experts estimate the cost of this military aid to be $2 billion.

[Reuters, London, 5th] The U.S. government hopes that the Senate will soon approve the North Atlantic Treaty, allowing it to take effect quickly. The global reaction to the treaty indicates that the division between East and West has become more severe as a result. Radio Moscow has launched further attacks on the treaty, accusing its initiators of attempting to start a new war.

### Two Major Fires Erupt Consecutively on Jiaozhou Road: Conflicts During Rescue Result in Injuries to Many Police Officers; Two Residents Killed, One Injured While Fleeing, More Than Two Hundred Straw Sheds and Wooden Houses Destroyed

[Our Newspaper] A major fire broke out in the straw sheds on Yuyao Road, No. 458 Lane, west of Jin'yuan Park on Jiaozhou Road in western Shanghai, at approximately 3:58 PM yesterday. After receiving the news, the Fire Brigade rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire. At the same time, the privately run Hu'xi Fire Brigade also dispatched fire trucks to assist. However, the area consisted of straw sheds and wooden houses, the water source was far away, and the order was chaotic, resulting in the burning of about 200 shacks. After receiving the report, the Jiangning Police Sub-bureau, led by the Sub-bureau Chief Li Wenjun, personally led Chief Lin and all the police officers to the scene to suppress the situation. The fire was completely extinguished at approximately 5 PM. When the fire was raging, firefighters were interfered with for no reason by unidentified individuals, and police officers from the Jiangning Police Sub-bureau were assaulted. After Sub-bureau Chief Li of the Sub-bureau tried his best to persuade them, and the Second Squadron of Flying Fortress stationed in the Sub-bureau dispatched two platoons to maintain order, the situation began to ease.

It is reported that the cause of the quarrel was that members of the voluntary fire brigade organized by Yuan Changsheng and Zhao Qingjin, the two Bao chiefs of No. 37 and 38 on Jinjia Lane, Jiaozhou Road, were not wearing uniforms and only wore white steel helmets. They insisted on snatching the fire hose from the fire department to put out the fire, which was rejected by the firefighters, resulting in an argument. Shortly after, Wang Yushu, a tricycle driver from a shack household in the fire scene, was electrocuted and died. When members of the voluntary fire brigade went forward to drag the body, they were seen by two police officers from the Jiangning Sub-bureau, No. 335 and No. 2741, who feared that they would be affected by the current and went forward to dissuade them, which caused another misunderstanding and a conflict occurred. At the scene, Yan Fenglou and Qian 　, the two squad leaders of the Flying Fortress, and police officers Zang Daquan, Tao Chi, Shu Yuewang, and Zhao Chongzhi were seriously injured by wooden sticks. Yan had three front teeth knocked out, and the glass of the red police car was also smashed. At that time, the Jiangning Police Bureau arrested sixteen perpetrators, including Yao Wencai, Wang Qiaolin, Zhou Zhihai, and Song Xiaolan. The main culprit, Zhang Shiyou, is at large. The injured police officers were immediately sent to the police hospital. Subsequently, it was found that the fire starter was Li Guangfu, nicknamed Little Leper, but he had fled with his family of three to avoid punishment. (Li was a worker in the Public Works Bureau). At that time, a citizen, Li Yongyu, was injured after jumping from a building, and an old man of 74 years old, Chen Shuangquan, fainted and died. Unexpectedly, at 7:28 PM, another fire suddenly broke out about 150 feet opposite the west end of the fire scene. The fire was completely extinguished at 9:05 PM after firefighters worked hard to rescue it. Fourteen wooden houses, from No. 61 to No. 75, and about 50 straw sheds were destroyed.

### Artificial Limbs Are Ingenious: Enable People with Disabilities to Move Freely; Whether It Is A Broken Arm Or Leg, It Is As Normal As Ordinary People to Take Things, Walk And Sit

[Special Feature of Our Newspaper] Broken limbs and disabled legs are a great misfortune in life. Once a person is disabled, it is not only extremely painful for themselves, but also a burden to society. Modern scientists with compassionate hearts have taken this into consideration and studied how to enable people with disabilities to move freely, support themselves without the help of others. Therefore, there are inventions of artificial limbs. After the end of the First European War, there were disabled people all over the European and American continents. Artificial limbs have been widely used and become more and more perfect.

The so-called artificial limb, in layman's terms, is a false hand or foot. Some are made of wood, some are made of leather, and the newest ones are made of an aluminum alloy called Duralurin. This metal is very light and very strong. After it is made, the outside is sprayed with flesh-colored oil paint, and the shape is like the hands and feet of models displayed in the store windows.

There Is A Spring In The Middle

Whether it is a prosthetic hand or a prosthetic foot, they are hollow. The prosthetic foot is shaped like a long boot, divided into types for residual legs above the knee and residual legs below the knee. There is no mystery in the installation method. The prosthetic foot of the residual leg above the knee is put on the remaining thigh, and a special strap connecting the steel joints on the prosthetic foot is put to the neck and tightly tied to the upper body and back. There is a spring in the center of the knee of the prosthetic foot, which can sit and walk freely, and can kneel without pain. The prosthetic foot for the residual leg below the knee is similar, and is tightly tied to the thigh of the disabled person with a leather strap. Prosthetic hands are usually made of light wood or leather. Depending on the situation of the broken arm, if it is completely broken, a shoulder strap is tightly set on the upper body; if it is half-broken, it is tied to the upper arm. A strong spring is installed inside the thumb, which can be opened and closed freely to pick up small objects.

Installation Cost Is Expensive

When making prosthetic hands and feet, the disabled person must first sit or lie flat on the paper, draw the size and thickness of the broken leg, and then use plaster to shape it so that the measurement can be accurate. It is also necessary to match the suspenders or leather straps according to each person's figure. Experienced technicians are required during installation to ensure that they fit well and move freely.

There is a Tiangong Foreign Firm on Jing'an Temple Road in this city, specializing in the manufacture and assembly of artificial limbs. It is said that the manufacture and assembly of each artificial hand or foot takes about two weeks. The metal prosthetic foot for the residual leg above the knee costs about 220 US dollars per piece, the prosthetic foot for the residual leg below the knee costs about 150 US dollars per piece, and the prosthetic hand costs about 200 US dollars per piece. Therefore, although it is said to be "ingenious", it is not something that poor people can afford.

### Outgoing Public Utilities Bureau Director Takes Family to the United States by Ship

[Our Newspaper] The former Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Zhao Zengjue, has taken his family to the United States on the President Cleveland ship yesterday, and the return date has not been determined. Zhao was ordered to preside over the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau after the victory during the tenure of Mayor Qian, until he resigned on the 21st of last month, for a total of three and a half years. During his term, he worked in a down-to-earth manner and fully promoted the public utilities in this city. Except for the price increase problem, which inevitably caused criticism from the citizens, his service spirit was praised by both Chinese and foreign people. However, the shooting of Zhong Quanzhou in the labor dispute of the public bus company caused complaints from the outside world. Although Zhao was not directly responsible, he was inevitably criticized by society because of his position as the supervisor. Surrounded by such an environment, Zhao firmly sought to leave and further went to the United States with his family. It is also learned that the central authorities recently intended to give him a directorship in a certain ministry, but he had no intention of pursuing an official career and wanted to go to the United States for sightseeing, so he did not accept it.

### Inspecting Southern Taihu Lake

—Special Correspondent of this Newspaper Chu Yusheng

"Taihu Lake is 800 li in circumference," this sentence, like "Taihu Lake is 36,000 hectares," describes the vastness of Taihu Lake's area. In fact, Taihu Lake is indeed very wide. Its surroundings include six counties: Wuxing, Changxing, Yixing, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Wujiang, spanning the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Looking out over Taihu Lake, there is no end in sight, like the ocean. Of course, because people's field of vision is limited, it can be considered vast.

From Wuxing to Taihu Lake, you must take a boat on the inner river for more than 20 li to Xiaomeikou or Daqiankou. These are the two largest openings along the coast of Taihu Lake. Xiaomeikou is a "three-family village" with only a dozen households. From Xiaomei, sail into the lake for about 20 li to reach a small island. This small island is less than two square li in area. It is called "Xiaoliumushan" and is empty. Only moss and weeds grow on the top of the stone, and wild gulls rest on it. When the boat approaches "Xiaoliumu," the flock of birds flies away, which is very beautiful. Another 50 li up is a large island. This island is called "Xishan," with markets, shops, houses, and buildings. Another 20 li up is another large island, called "Dongshan," which is also a place for the gathering and dispersal of lake products, and where merchants trade. These two mountains are rich in loquats, bayberries, peaches, pomegranates, etc. There is also "Shigushan," which is also a scenic area. If you go further up, the peaks in the lake rise abruptly, which is spectacular. Passing this, you can go straight to Wuxi.

A local at "Xiaomei" told the reporter: Taihu Lake has 36 famous islands and 72 unnamed islands. The so-called unnamed islands probably refer to unnamed peaks. There are many other hidden reefs at the bottom of the lake. If you are not careful, boats and ships are very likely to hit the reefs and sink. Moreover, "Taihu Lake has three-foot waves without wind." When the wind is strong and the waves are high, if you are not familiar with the waters of Taihu Lake, it is difficult to move an inch. According to locals: the depth of Xiaomei Port is two to eight feet, and the depth in the lake is more than two fathoms. Traffic on the lake relies on merchant ships, which travel back and forth from Wuxi to Wuxing, and from Xishan to Wuxing.

The ships in Taihu Lake are graded by the mast: generally, the first grade has three to four masts, the second grade has five masts, and the third grade has seven masts. The first-grade ships enter the port to berth, while the second and third-grade ships stay in Taihu Lake and do not enter the port. When a strong wind and waves come, they raise the masts and sails and go with the wind. Most of these ships make a living by fishing. In spring, they catch sturgeon, in summer, they catch whitebait, and in autumn and winter, they catch large fish. These sturgeon, whitebait, and large fish are very delicious and are specialties among domestic aquatic products. Each boat can probably exchange the fish caught every day for a dan of rice money, but they cannot fish when it rains or there is no wind. They have to rest for more than ten days a month.

The fishermen's total income is divided into three uses: three-tenths for eating, four-tenths for repairing boats, and three-tenths for offering sacrifices to heaven. They are very superstitious about "heaven," believing that their lives in the lake are completely entrusted to the heavens, and that the warmth and food they receive are also bestowed by the heavens. Fishermen do not stay overnight on the shore but live in boats. Fishermen also do not marry outsiders (i.e., non-fishermen). It is said that there is a lone tree on a hill in Xiaomei. Every summer, a giant python coils around the tree and roars. The fishermen regard it as a god and Buddha and burn incense and worship.

Fishermen rarely have the opportunity to receive education because they must set off to fish when the wind comes and cannot study every day. Wealthy fishermen hire teachers to teach the children on the boats, but most of the teachers they hire are old-fashioned teachers who do not know new science and new knowledge.

There are 160 fishing boats entering the port of Xiaomei, which are organized into one bao, with Wang Genfu as the bao chief. Wang himself has seven boats. In the Xiaomei and Daqian areas, he is known as Bao Chief Wang. Bao Chief Wang's reputation resounds in southern Taihu Lake. All the boats in Taihu Lake have to buy him some credit, and everyone listens to his words. It is said that there is another person like Chief Bao in northern Taihu Lake. With these two in northern and southern Taihu Lake, the security of Taihu Lake is much better.

According to people in Taihu Lake: "There are no bandits in Taihu Lake at all, but bandits live scattered along the coast of Taihu Lake. Whenever they have a chance, they go into Taihu Lake to loot, and then return to the shore to live as gentlemen. The targets of looting are of course merchant ships and the like. The former 'Tai Bao A Shu' was like that. Now southern Taihu Lake is considered very peaceful. Although there are times when people emerge in Taihu Lake flying the flag of the Communist army, they have not come to southern Taihu Lake."

If you go deep into Taihu Lake, you will naturally encounter them. If they see you looking unfamiliar, they may make you embarrassed and uncomfortable. When the reporter sailed from Xiaomei to inspect southern Taihu Lake, it was a day of bright sunshine, gentle breeze, and the lake was as flat as a mirror. According to the locals, such calm weather has been rare in the past two months. As we returned from southern Taihu Lake to Xiaomei, we saw a setting sun, with the evening glow covering half the sky, reflected in the lake as a golden light, gradually as the sun set in the west and the night mist enveloped the entire lake. On the boundless horizon, suddenly a silver-white horizontal line circled the vast lake.

Taihu Lake is lovely because it provides convenient cultivation and irrigation for the counties near Taihu Lake. Because of it, tens of thousands of fishermen rely on their lives. We should make these irrigation projects more advantageous by using the most scientific methods. We should enable these many fishermen to receive the education that citizens should receive, and we should further improve the rural environment along the coast of Taihu Lake and the unreasonable lives of the fishermen. If we want to do this, we must live on the coast of Taihu Lake or on a boat on Taihu Lake for a period of time, become familiar with their living conditions, and then gradually improve it through patient persuasion.

### Chen Zhanshan Blood Case: A Chorus of Demands for the Arrest of the Murderer

[Reported by this newspaper from Xi'an on the 1st] After Chen Zhanshan, the former secretary of the Chenggu County Council in Shaanxi Province, was murdered, his wife, in order to oppose the local judicial authorities' transfer of the Chen case to the jurisdiction of Xi'an, wrote an article pursuing the murderer. The last paragraph of her original manuscript was particularly stern and righteous. The text of Mrs. Chen's original text is as follows:

The Chinese people still have a conscience. At the beginning of the tragedy, they received the support of 200,000 people and the support of fair, conscientious, and bloody people from all over the world, as well as the attention of all levels of agencies to this tragedy. From November 36, the provincial government sent inspector Wang Xiangquan and the Greater District Security Commander Ci Derang, together with more than ten agencies and sixty witnesses, to investigate for three months and two days, and found the murderer. Except for the fugitives Wang Wende and Wei Ziyu, the rest, such as the principal offender Meng Ruotong, Yu Xianzhou, the accomplice Hou Linbin, and the murderers Luo Tianhe, Lian Chengbi, and Lei Mingxing, have all been arrested one after another. After continuous investigation, Meng Ruotong and Yu Xianzhou were sentenced to life imprisonment for instigating murder and deprived of their political rights for life. Luo Tianhe, Lian Chengwang, and Lei Mingxing were sentenced to death for committing murder together and deprived of their political rights for life. Elders of Chenggu! Urgently hope that the murderer will be brought to justice, and further expect the law enforcement authorities to impose the death penalty on the principal offender!

What is most heartbreaking is that not long after the judgment was announced, when her husband Chen Zhanshan's coffin had not yet been buried, the murderers Meng Ruotong and others deceived the Supreme Court and obtained permission to transfer jurisdiction. Duan Shaojiu, the president of the Nanzheng High Branch Court, disregarded national law, disregarded the people, and was not afraid of public opinion. Taking the opportunity of transferring jurisdiction, he released Meng Ruotong on January 28 of this year and Yu Xianzhou on February 25. As a result, the murderers acted unscrupulously in Nanzheng, flaunting themselves on the market all day long, and did not extinguish their prestige of that year. After she appealed to the court, they restrained themselves. Are these criminals? Are these murderers sentenced to life imprisonment? Are these murderers deprived of their political rights for life?

Her husband Chen Zhanshan was murdered for exposing corruption. The government solved the case and handed it over to the court for trial. The government's responsibility cannot be considered over. It should be the beginning of supervision and should not be ignored, so that the victim's grievances will not be cleared!

Now, the first thing to say about this case is that there is no need to transfer it. The victim is from Chenggu. The judges and judges of the Nanzheng High Branch Court are all foreigners (not only are there no Chenggu people, but there are no people from southern Shaanxi). There is no need for recusal. Secondly, it cannot be transferred:

(1) Due to the impact of the war in Xi'an, various agencies have moved south one after another, and prisoners have been dispersed. Nanzheng should be safer. However, the court transferred the major criminals Meng Ruotong and Yu Xianzhou to Xi'an, a combat zone. Is it more difficult to communicate than Nanzheng to be more insured?

(2) The High Court also feels that Xi'an is unsafe and has set up an office in Nanzheng. It feels that it cannot stand on its own! How can the prisoners be transferred there?

(3) If this case is transferred to Xi'an, the fifty or sixty witnesses all have jobs. Under the whip of life, they cannot even guarantee their own lives. How can they have the time and money to testify?

(4) Her husband Chen Zhanshan has served for half his life and left behind orphans and widows, debts, and the burden of living. The lives of the living are on the verge of despair. How can they raise travel expenses!

(5) Even if Nian Ci is eager to avenge her husband, she begs for food to pursue the murderer. Meng Ruotong and Yu Xianzhou have many accomplices. Since they can kill her husband, who will be responsible for Nian Ci's safety on the road?

(6) If a war breaks out in Xi'an, can the court guarantee the safety of the prisoners?

Based on the above points, this case not only cannot be transferred, but it is also unnecessary to transfer it. However, the High Court is now transferring it, which implies that it is sheltering and facilitating the release of the prisoners. It is not difficult to imagine this. I specifically ask your newspaper to report the grievances of the weak who have no one to appeal to, and to urge the law enforcement authorities to leave a little dignity for the law! Return the major criminals Meng Yu and others to Nanzheng for trial, so that the grievances can be cleared as soon as possible, and both the living and the dead will be grateful.

### A Soldier Strangled to Death Outside the Hanbeimen Gate in Changshu

[Reported by this newspaper from Changshu on the 5th] A body of an unknown male wearing a yellow uniform was suddenly found in the river outside the Baishen Nunnery outside the Hanbeimen Gate in Taici Town on the 4th. He was about thirty years old. The town police Li Huanzhang stopped it and reported it to the District Prosecutor's Office for examination. There was a photo of a graduation certificate from the Township Cadre Training Institute of the Executive Yuan Pacification District Political Affairs Committee, an identity card of Miao Wei (with the address of No. 5, Jia 4, Bao 1, Pingqiao Township, Huaian County, military sector), two military symbols (one named Wang Linhua, one named Lin Wei), a leather wallet, in the deceased's pocket, with a page of red wrapping paper from Nantong Lao Tianbao Jewelry Store (with the words "3.52 qian of pure gold Tianyuan ring" written in pen), an envelope (addressed to Mr. Miao Xia, No. 503 Chaoyue Building, Rehe Road, Xiaguan, Nanjing), and on the loose-leaf diary in the leather wallet, there was the handwriting of Miss Fan Suzhen, No. 139 Baota Road, Zhenjiang. In addition, there were two seals made of ox horn and crystal, both engraved with the words Miao Wei. After examining the male corpse in public, there were four rope marks around the neck, surrounding him, and there were no traces of silt in the fingertips. It was determined that he was strangled to death before he died and thrown into the river after his death. The examination report was prepared and attached to the file. The corpse was ordered to be collected and temporarily stored by the town police in charge, with a marker inserted, waiting for the relatives of the corpse to claim it. All the confiscated items were kept in the case.

(2) If the original note is received by the 7th of this month, each client will supplement the payment with a local bank or firm's promissory note, with the sugar price set at 20,000 gold yuan per municipal dan. (3) If the note is dishonored again on the 7th of this month, or if the loan payment is not handed over, future allotments will be suspended.

### National Action Using Own Foreign Exchange to Purchase Large Amounts of Gold from the US

[By Our Reporter] According to Central Bank Business Bureau Director Lin Chongyong's statement to reporters yesterday, the national bank has indeed used its own foreign exchange to purchase a large amount of gold from the United States at the official price (note: the official price of gold in the United States is $35 per ounce). It is now being shipped to Shanghai in batches to replenish the national bank's gold reserves and stabilize gold prices in the long term. When asked by reporters about rumors that the national bank had recently shipped back a large amount of gold from South China, Lin replied, "I do not wish to comment on this matter."

### Gold Market Stagnant Inside, Active Trading Outside

[By Our Reporter] Yesterday, trading in the gold market was stagnant. Due to the upper limit restriction, it was greatly disconnected from the off-market price. Buying and selling were in a wait-and-see state in the morning, and no formal trading opened until noon. In the afternoon, the opening price rose to the upper limit of 1.32 million, remaining there until closing. Only one large transaction was concluded, up 220,000 from the previous day, equivalent to 2 yuan in interest.

Off-Market

Off-market trading was lively, with "matching" groups actively buying and selling. The opening price in the morning was relatively stable, quoted at 1.5 million and 1.55 million. Securities firms and large investors bought gold, creating strong buying momentum that pushed prices up to 1.6 million and 1.65 million. Around noon, the Central Bank sold off some gold at high prices, secretly releasing over 2,000 taels. Individual investors also started selling, and the market softened, with the noon closing price falling slightly to 1.43 million and 1.48 million.

In the afternoon, due to tight credit conditions, unofficial interest rates rose again to around 3 yuan, dampening sentiment and weakening the upward momentum. The opening price was 1.42 million and 1.47 million, and short covering slightly boosted prices to 1.45 million and 1.5 million. The closing price then fell again to 1.412 million and 1.47 million, down 120,000 from the previous day. The overnight interest rate increased by 220,000 per tael, with prices quoted as high as 1.64 million and 1.69 million.

Gold Jewelry

Yesterday, gold jewelry shops resumed price listings around 11 a.m., with buying prices at 1.44 million and selling prices at 1.6 million. The afternoon prices remained unchanged, up 160,000 from the previous listing. Silver jewelry also rose by 3,000, reaching highs of 16,000 and 20,000. Money exchange shops did not list prices in the morning, but in the afternoon, the buying price was 1.35 million and the selling price was 1.55 million.

US Dollars

Yesterday, trading in US dollars remained scarce. The opening price in the morning was 32,000 and 34,000, rising to 33,000 and 35,000, and falling to 28,000 and 30,000. The noon closing price was 32,000 and 34,000. In the afternoon, prices stabilized. The opening price was 32,000 and 34,000, briefly rising to 36,500 and 34,500, before falling again to 36,000 and 34,000 at the close. The trend was firm, with little change from the previous day. The overnight interest rate increased by 4,500, with prices quoted as high as 36,500 and 38,500. Street trading was chaotic, with cash transactions quoted at 30,000 and 32,000.

Silver Dollars

Yesterday, there were not many silver dollar arbitrage transactions. Approximately 1 million was arbitrated out of South China, and another 1.5 million was arbitrated out of West China and North China. The exchange rate was as high as 8 yuan and as low as 6 yuan per 100 yuan. Street trading was brisk due to the unstable situation, with active repatriation of funds from various parties. Securities firms and money exchange shops were actively seeking silver dollars. In the morning, "big heads" were quoted at 26,000 and 27,000, and in the afternoon, they rushed to cross the three levels, rising from 27,000 and 28,000 to 28,000 and 29,000. "Small heads" were quoted at 22,000 and 23,000, and "eagle dragon" dollars were quoted at 17,000 and 18,000, a jump of 5,000 from the previous day. Transactions of bank drafts with "big heads" opened in the morning at 28,000 and 29,000, and in the afternoon, each reached as high as 31,000 and 32,000.

### Bulls and Bears Grapple Again, Shanghai Stocks Slightly Up

[By Our Reporter] Yesterday's Shanghai stock market was almost entirely surrounded by bearish sentiment amid tight credit conditions. Although major investors tried their best to push prices up, the prohibition of same-day check clearing tightened market credit. Although the tight credit situation was not as dire as the previous day, unofficial interest rates remained high, and off-market interest rates for Yong Yarn also opened high at 140-145 yuan. Bulls could not withstand the pressure of high interest rates, and buying momentum decreased sharply. Yong Yarn opened in the morning at 23.4 yuan, and major investors continued to support it, immediately rising to 25.1 yuan. The overnight floating shorts continued, and off-market bearish sentiment enveloped the market, making it impossible to maintain support on the trading floor. The market softened frequently, closing the morning at 23.9 yuan.

Small and medium-sized stocks remained relatively firm. Xinyi, Xinguang, and Zhongnong Bank were vigorously promoted, and ultimately all closed at their upper limits. Meiya, Jingfu, and Dongxing all rose after opening, but weakened at the close. Tongyi and Guohuo also saw their upper limits due to behind-the-scenes support. Zhenhua was the only stock that fell to its lower limit. The performance of other stocks varied.

In the afternoon, Yong Yarn initially opened at 23 yuan, but off-market prices had already risen to 25.7 yuan and 26.2 yuan, improving sentiment. Strong buying covered on the trading floor, and prices rose to 25 yuan. As the closing approached, off-market prices gradually fell, and short-term bulls sold off, causing the market to soften slightly, closing at 24.5 yuan.

### Record Number of Returned Checks

[By Our Reporter] Yesterday, most banks and financial institutions in the city continued to suspend same-day check clearing, and most industries and markets remained in a state of semi-paralysis. As the implementation of suspending same-day clearing began a few days ago, the check clearing results broke the unprecedented record of "eight returns out of ten checks." The city was filled with returned check notices, truly a strange phenomenon seen only in the city's financial market after the victory.

According to statistics, the total value of returned checks from the clearing results a few days ago exceeded 70 billion yuan, accounting for one-third of the total clearing value that day. If the bank draft portion of the cleared checks is excluded and only the cleared checks are calculated, the value of returned checks accounted for 80% of the total value of cleared checks.

### Market Ramblings

Rental Rates Should Follow the Index - What's the Logic Behind This?

A news report stated that rental rates can be adjusted according to the index, a suggestion from the city councilor gentlemen. If this news is true, please have the councilor gentlemen come forward and elaborate on their wise opinions so that all sectors of society and all citizens can fairly judge. Rental rates should not be adjusted according to the index, as I already stated in the March 30th issue of this newspaper. I may be insignificant, but reason should not be determined by a person's status.

Rental rates should not be adjusted according to the index because real estate is property, not a commodity. Businesses selling goods must price them based on the replacement cost. Employees selling their labor must calculate wages based on the cost of living needed to sustain that labor. Money lenders must appropriately raise interest rates to compensate for the loss in currency value upon repayment. However, interest rates do not follow the index because the principal of the loan must still be repaid.

The sale of real estate must be priced based on the replacement cost, so real estate prices also follow general price levels, and no one has ever objected to that.

However, when renting out real estate, the property rights still belong to the owner, and they do not need to replace anything at market prices. Therefore, rental rates should not follow general price levels.

If rental rates were to follow the index, then the value of the property they own would increase with prices, and rental rates would also increase with prices. This would be equivalent to selling goods without delivering them, while continuously demanding increased profits from the buyer based on the market price. Where in the world is there such logic? I ask the city councilor gentlemen, what is the basis for your suggestion that rental rates should follow the index? Allow us to "learn" from you!

If we don't talk about reason and just talk about facts, assuming that theory and fact can be unrelated, then let's talk about facts!

First: Let's talk about fairness. During high inflation, businesses see prices increase when they sell, but also when they buy. Prices increase at the same time, so businesses only have attractive-looking paper assets and no real profit from price increases. The real estate industry in the past was the same as general industries, but if rental rates were to follow the index, it would be very different. Not only would paper assets increase dramatically with rising real estate prices, but rental income would also increase proportionally with prices. This would be nothing less than allowing them to obtain double benefits, allowing them to uniquely obtain real windfall profits during inflation. If you call this fair, then there is no justice in the world!

Second: Let's talk about whether tenants can afford it. When prices rise, businesses see prices rise when they buy and when they sell. Wages are high, interest rates are high, and every household is struggling. If rental rates were to follow prices again, it would be the same as not allowing them to barely survive, strangling them in one fell swoop. As for the general public, their income wages follow the index, but their living expenses follow prices. The index lags behind prices, so everyone is spending more than they earn and suffering unspeakable hardships. I ask the councilor gentlemen, why don't you think about the city's businesses and citizens? Why do you only want to help the large landlords? There are no fewer than five or six million people in Shanghai, but large landlords number no more than two or three thousand. Why are the councilor gentlemen eager to offer their wisdom to the smallest number of people? And why are you happy to engage in this "robbing the poor to enrich the rich" activity?

Double Windfall Profits Are Unconscionable; You Shouldn't Rob the Poor to Help the Rich

### Joint Yarn and Cloth Export Plan to Be Implemented Upon Approval

[By Our Reporter] The Six District Cotton Textile Association, concerned about the large-scale dumping of Japanese cotton products in the Southeast Asian and Indian markets, which has led to a continuous decline in the export prices of yarn and cloth and difficulties in sales, intends to unite national and private factories of all sizes to organize a joint export organization in order to address the current crisis and lay a permanent foundation for exports. The goal is to reduce unit costs under the principle of cooperation among all factories and large-scale manufacturing. At the same time, they will research technological improvements to ensure that their products meet the needs of foreign markets. To ensure smooth progress, they hope the government will provide encouragement and assistance.

This plan is currently only a draft and will be implemented after discussions with all industry members. Regarding a part of the report, some industry members believe that there is a tendency for large factories to deprive small factories of their rights, which is likely based on speculative misunderstandings. Joint export development is one thing, and the proxy spinning of US aid cotton is another, and the two cannot be confused.

The US Aid Committee and the Economic Cooperation Administration are in charge of how to fairly distribute US aid cotton, and the export organization cannot arbitrarily make decisions. Therefore, the establishment of a joint export organization will not affect the original US aid cotton quotas of each factory. It is heard that the draft is currently being reviewed by the association's national and private members.

### Cotton Yarn Untradeable

Due to the overnight check returns and the unsettled interest disputes, the cotton yarn market has not yet been fully resolved, so trading cannot be started. However, there were some offers for 21-count double horse yarn, with prices at 5.5 million yuan.

### Cloth Market Paralyzed

Yesterday, the cloth market was paralyzed. The market authorities initially announced to all industry members that all payments for transactions must be made in cash or bank drafts. If disputes arise from check payments, the association will not be responsible. Therefore, no trading opened. However, there were indeed off-market offers, with Longtou fine cloth at 200,000 yuan and Sijunzi yuan serge at 185,000 yuan, but actual transactions were scarce. Private factories have not yet started selling, and wholesale door shops are also very idle.

### China Textile Sells Yarn

[By Our Reporter] Textile Construction Company continued to sell yarn as usual yesterday. Only one household applied to purchase one piece of 42-count double-strand Hongbao light yarn at a price of 9.9 million yuan.

In addition, for the more than 600 pieces of cotton yarn entrusted to Textile Construction Company by the Central Bank to be sold on Monday, both parties agreed that those who paid yesterday would pay at Monday's transaction price plus 10%. However, all payments could not be completed yesterday, and it was agreed that those who pay today would pay at Monday's transaction price plus 16%.

### Three Different Prices in the Market, Rice Trading Was Quiet Yesterday, Prices Did Not Exceed the 170,000 Limit

The rice market's Spring Festival holiday is over, and trading resumed yesterday. However, because checks cannot be cleared on the same day, both buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and trading was scarce. Prices did not exceed the limit of 170,000. There were three types of prices in the market: checks, bank drafts, and cash. The check price for white japonica rice was 168,000 yuan, the price for thin rice was 169,000 yuan, and the price for early rice was 166,000 yuan, each up by more than 10,000 yuan from before the holiday. The bank draft price was lower than the check price, and the cash price was even lower than the bank draft price. The total arrival of goods in the North and South markets was 14,032 shi.

Cooking Oil

Trading started yesterday. Because checks were not cleared on the same day, most transactions were conducted with bank drafts, and there were also some check transactions, but very few were concluded. Soybean oil was 850,000 yuan, and vegetable oil was 750,000 yuan, each up by 80-90,000 yuan from before the holiday. The price of Jietong vegetable oil was 900,000 and 880,000, up slightly by 40,000. Soybean cake rose by 8-9,000, with very few sales.

Flour

The market trend turned weak due to the inability to clear checks on the same day. The market lacked bank drafts, and credit conditions remained tight, making it impossible for goods owners to sell. The market trend declined all the way from the peak. The highest price for old car flour was 65,000, retreating to the 60,000 level at the close. The price for "warship" flour once rose to 62,000, but then fell below the 60,000 level, trading at 57,700 yuan. Although it was up from last Saturday, the decline was severe compared to other off-market goods or the interest rates.

Miscellaneous Grains

The market was filled with checks and bank drafts, and trading was chaotic. Soybeans rose by about 20% compared to last Saturday. Jiujiang winter soybeans traded at 150,000 yuan with checks. The supply and demand for raw peanuts was scarce, with less than 100 bags traded, and prices also rose by 20%. Corn rose slightly by 10%, all traded with checks. Sesame trading was not active, and red sorghum traded at 73,000 yuan.

### Women's Basketball Technique

— Translated and Described by Qi Gong

Discussion on Offensive Methods

The previous issue clarified the moving zone defense system and various basic formations used in women's basketball. Significant progress has been made in defensive tactics, which is the result of foreign guidance and research in recent years. However, advanced defensive tactics also require advanced offensive formations to break through the defense. Moreover, "offense is the best defense." Even if a team has an extremely solid defensive fortress, if the forwards lack sharp offensive momentum, it will be difficult to reduce the threat of enemy attacks. Even if the forwards score, it may not be enough to offset the points lost by the defense, resulting in a net loss. Therefore, no team that is good at defense but not good at offense can be sure of winning.

Military strategy says, "Those who are good at offense make the enemy not know what to defend." It also says, "Offense is the basis of defense, and defense is the strategy of offense - subtle, so subtle, to the point of being formless; mysterious, so mysterious, to the point of being soundless, so one can control the enemy's fate." This means that to maintain control of the overall situation, one must have sound defense and also skillful offense. Those who are good at offense can make the enemy come together and separate, gather and scatter, scheming in secret and planning meticulously, so that one can take the initiative everywhere, strategizing before the keyhole and determining victory and defeat under the important area of the basket. This is the kind of tactical play that a mature team can adopt in offense. If an immature team cannot even use simple screen plays skillfully and has not mastered basic movements correctly, it is futile to attempt tactical play, which is no different from drawing a tiger that ends up looking like a dog.

Looking at the women's teams in Shanghai, only the Green Team is a mature team that has the qualifications to use tactics. If the other teams can perform simple screen plays skillfully, it is already commendable. Discussing the practice of tactics is not difficult to know, but difficult to implement. Taking Renyu as an example, they have been practicing the S.One. set of tactics for two years, but they still cannot use it satisfactorily. This shows that practicing a set of tactics requires a long period of practice. If it is a case of sudden enthusiasm followed by prolonged neglect, the result will be one inch forward and one foot back.

Mildred E. Anderson, a women's basketball coach at the University of Michigan, has done in-depth research on offensive tactics in women's basketball. He said: In recent times, women's basketball teams have made significant progress in zone defense. Therefore, teams must have more coordinated communication and various precise shooting techniques when attacking in order to break through the advanced moving zone defense. If relying solely on the forwards to launch attacks is not enough to break through the opponent's defensive formation, the guards must quickly pass the ball across the center line to coordinate with the forwards in launching effective attacks.

If the players on each team do not individually have sophisticated skills, it will be difficult to achieve good results with offensive plays. If players cannot control the ball well and cannot rebound the ball under the basket, it is no different from weakening the team's offense. Without skilled floor play and if the guards cannot quickly pass the ball across the center line, the forwards' offensive momentum cannot be enhanced.

Anderson explained in the article that if a team can skillfully use and keep in mind the basic techniques, it may enable the forwards and guards to cooperate skillfully and agilely to accelerate the offense. The following basic techniques are applicable regardless of whether men's rules or women's rules are used. (To be continued - A)

### Hong Kong Silver Shield Football Final Exciting and Moving; South China Wins the Championship in Extra Time; Kitchee Once Led 3-1

[Hong Kong Air News] Under the bright sun, amidst elegant clothing and handsome figures, Happy Valley once again presented a scene of flowing cars and bustling crowds. It turned out to be the auspicious day for the Special Silver Shield Group A and B finals. No wonder the Hong Kong racecourse was packed with tens of thousands of people, with no empty seats.

The Group A final was performed at 4:00 p.m. In addition to Song Lingsheng still recovering from his injury and not participating, Zhu Yongqiang and Xie Jinhe, who were stranded in Guangzhou due to the "Peace Wheel Incident," also arrived on time, forming the most complete lineup for South China. Kitchee, in addition to the retirement of "Blind Tiger" Zhao Fu, also sent out a very strong team. As a result of the game, South China, with its long-winning record, won the Silver Shield in extra time with a score of 5-3, but they had been in an absolute disadvantage with a score of 1-3 and went through an extremely thrilling process. Kitchee's loss was due to the lack of final efforts.

To be fair, South China did not perform well in this battle. Slow forward progression, slow shooting, and a lack of players who dared to charge forward were all major flaws of the "long-winning army." I think if South China unfortunately loses a battle, it will be a regrettable thing that these shortcomings have not been improved.

Therefore, Kitchee took the lead with a score of 3-1 in the early stage of the game when the entire army was full of fighting spirit, entirely because they dared to fight and dared to charge, achieving the results of using space. Unfortunately, in the ten minutes before the end of the second half, South China scored twice in the open goal to force a tie. In extra time, they lost their previous fighting spirit and handed over the glorious and brilliant championship to the other side, retiring to the second seat, which really made the audience "slap their thighs" and sigh!

When South China was losing 1-3, and after attacking for a long time, they could not achieve their goals. Seeing that the game was about to end, not only did the spectators think that Kitchee could secure the victory, but also the entire South China army was in danger and despondent, kicking lazily. However, they were finally able to force a tie in the last ten minutes, and even scored two more goals in the first ten minutes of extra time to secure the victory, also showing their calm and unperturbed experience.

I hope that all the South China players will remember the lessons of the China United team barely winning the Memorial Cup against the Army and losing to the Western United in the Governor's Cup. In this battle, they should not be arrogant because of victory, but should humbly review their "gains" and "losses." This is a loyal admonition that concerns the future, and I hope South China will encourage themselves!

In order to strengthen the combat effectiveness of this battle, Kitchee had Zhu "Officer," who had been retired for a long time, and "Blackie" still played. Please see the lineup of both sides:

South China

Yu Yaode

Zhang Shuling Hou Rongsheng

Liu Songsheng Xie Jinhong Zhang Jinhai

Xie Jinhe Li Zhaorong Zhu Yongqiang Feng Jingxiang He Yingfen

Kitchee

Zhu Zhaoheng

Mo Jinsong Zhen Yaohua

Luo Weiquan You Huaxing Li Bingzhao

Huang Jingsong Yao Zhuoran Guo Yingqi Zhang Songgen Deng Guangsen

South China Lost a Penalty Kick First

After the start of the game, both sides attacked and defended each other. After five minutes, "Ah Xie" got the opportunity to invade, and Shuling failed to control his rush, causing him to cut into the penalty area. Jinhong saw that the situation was critical and tripped him from behind, resulting in a penalty kick. "Chili Boy" acted as the executioner, taking a fierce kick. Although "De" blocked it with his right hand, the momentum was too strong and it was still drilled into the net. Kitchee took the lead with a score of 1-0.

South China was unwilling to lose and launched a large-scale counterattack. After a long battle, Jinhe tricked "Big Dog" and passed the ball to the right. It looked like it was about to go out of bounds. "Second Uncle" headed it back in front of the goal. Zhu Tsai rushed forward and headed it again. Although "Old Zhu" managed to slap it out with his hand in time, Zhu Tsai added another kick, and the ball went straight into the net like an arrow. The "Officer" was not three heads and six arms, so he had to temporarily let South China tie the score back to 1-1.

Kitchee Led 3-1

"Ah Xie" got excited and came to stir up trouble again. Shuling could not resist. He just saw him make a wonderful cross, and Songgen wanted to shoot but missed. "Liang De" had not yet taken his eyes off Songgen, when Yingqi kicked the ball into the net with lightning speed. At this point, Kitchee took the lead again with a score of 2-1.

After a long time in the second half, Zhuoran was seen getting the ball and dribbling into South China's hinterland. Xie and Hou came to fight together, but he still broke through the gap and shot the ball into the net, Kitchee "rejoiced" with a score of 3-1!

South China became more and more chaotic as they fought. Seeing that the situation was about to be settled, ten minutes before the end of the game, Zhu Tsai was seen winning the ball in the middle and taking advantage of Kitchee's vacant defense, charging forward alone. "Old Zhu" abandoned the city and rushed out. Zhu Tsai watched the route carefully and, when "Old Zhu" rushed close, gently passed the ball towards the empty goal, chasing back the score to 2-3.

Li Zhaorong Tied the Score

South China's fighting spirit only flourished after winning back this goal. They saw another wave of group attacks, Jinhe made a wonderful pass in the middle, Zhu Tsai shot fiercely near the goal, but it was blocked by Zhaohong and fell not far away, landing at the feet of Buddha. "Buddha" faced the "empty goal," unhurriedly sent the treasure in, making the score a 3-3 tie. The ninety-minute game soon ended.

The referee blew the whistle for extra time. Songgen was injured and could not come out, so Kitchee had to fight with only ten people at first. South China took the opportunity to attack. Zhu Tsai crossed from the baseline, and Jinhai rushed up and flicked it in. South China immediately reversed the defeat into a victory with a score of 4-3.

After Kitchee lost this goal, Zhang Songgen immediately returned, but Yingqi retreated to defend, thinking he could control "Second Uncle's" activity. Unexpectedly, it was of no help, and the front line was formed into a "leaderless army." In order to enhance the charging force, South China transferred Jinhai to lead the army and Yingfen to retreat to defend. Less than three minutes from winning this goal, Jinhai was again seen rushing into Kitchee's heart, and still kicked the ball from the left side with his right foot at an impossible angle, and it entered the right side, completing a 5-3 victory.

In the next ten minutes of the change of direction, both sides were tired and could not fight anymore, they were just delaying time in "slow motion".

After the end of the extra time game, the two silver medals were awarded by the Football Association Chairman Lady Morse to the captains of the Group A and B champion teams, and the silver cup was awarded to the Group A runner-up, and each of the four participating athletes was awarded a commemorative medal. South China's Yu Yaode presented a bouquet of fresh flowers to Mrs. Morse, and after the entire team shouted three cheers, this Special Silver Shield final for Group A and B ended in the twilight. (Qinglang)

### Bus Wins Group B Silver Medal: 3-1 Victory Over South China

[Hong Kong Airmail] In the Group B Silver Shield final match between Bus and South China, both sides mobilized their full strength. Bus’s red jerseys were dazzling, with star players Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan, and Zhuo Shijin, along with veterans Yang Genbao, Sun Bao'an, Tan Jiajun, and Huang Ruiqi – all "quasi-Group A" athletes – taking to the field. This was unprecedented in Group B, and even exceeded the strength of many current Group A teams. South China also appeared in vibrant blue, with a strong and robust team, but a closer look at the roster revealed they were clearly less formidable.

As a result, Bus defeated South China 3-1, rightfully claiming the Group B Silver Shield. However, considering the situation at the time, South China's performance was not inferior to Bus on average. Were it not for goalkeeper Bao Jingxian's ineptitude, Bus would have found it difficult to win. Conversely, Bus's ability to maintain their lead was largely thanks to the stable and steadfast performance of their goalkeeper, Sun Bao'an.

Although named a "Group B" match, this duel was swift and exciting, rarely seen even in the Group A league. The dangerous long shots from Li Songxian and the veteran skills of the "national players" were enough to elicit endless praise from the audience.

In the first half, Zhuo Shijin launched a long shot, which Zhong Jingsheng headed into the net while the South China goalkeeper was flustered and at a loss. (1-0) Less than five minutes into the second half, Yang Genbao seized upon South China's ineptitude and scored with another long shot. (2-0) Later, South China's Zhu Jincheng started an attack on the flank, delivering a beautiful cross, and Li Songxian responded in kind with a long shot, making it 2-1. Finally, Bus's Tan Jiajun received the ball and passed it forward, where Zhong Jingsheng charged through the chaotic defense and scored, completing the 3-1 victory. The two lineups were as follows:

Bus B

Sun Bao'an

Li Tiansheng   Mai Shaohan

Tan Jiajun   Luo Baoshan   Huang Ruiqi

Chen Jinrui   Zhuo Shijin   Zhong Jingsheng   Yang Genbao   Zeng Mingquan

South China B

Bao Jingxian

Jian Zhien   Ruan Peiwen

Feng Shutang   Guo Su   Zhu Dewen

Zhuo Yun   Zhou Jie   He Wenjie   Li Songxian   Zhu Jincheng

### Hard-Court Tennis Exhibition: Hong Kong Defeats Saigon

[Hong Kong Airmail] The Hong Kong-Saigon tennis exhibition match, played under the Davis Cup system on hard courts at the Chinese Recreation Club, has concluded successfully, with Hong Kong defeating Saigon 3-2.

The results of the first day were:

Wen Sui

6-4   4-6   6-2

Xu Runpei

Ye Guanxiong

6-3   6-0

A Long

The results of the second day were:

A Long

6-2   6-1

Xu Runpei

Ye Guanxiong

8-6   6-3

Wen Sui

Ye Guanxiong   Xu Weipei

7-5   6-4

Wen Sui   A Long

Regarding the second act of the competition, according to He Jia, the schedule will be decided after Du Bei (ranked sixth in France) arrives and the draw is redone. It seems Hong Kong still has a better chance of winning, as Du Bei is certainly better than Wen Sui. However, French tennis players may not be skilled on grass, and Xu Weipei will participate in the second singles match on grass at the Cricket Club, where he has a chance to defeat Wen Sui.

### Table Tennis Tournament Lacks Venues: Appeal for Local Table Tennis Rooms

The fourth annual table tennis league, organized by the Shanghai Sports Association Table Tennis Committee, is scheduled to commence on April 11. The league handbook, which includes the names of all 55 team members, the league regulations, and the addresses of the venues, is being printed and will be distributed to each team before the start of the competition for reference. The schedule for the first week is being arranged. According to Secretary-General Chen Linsheng, although there are eight venues, only the Jingwu Athletic Association and the Postal Workers' Union have agreed to host matches four evenings a week. The remaining six venues, including Silk Industry, Hualian, Shanbao, Xinyi, Yousi, and Guohuo, can only be used when their respective teams are playing. Therefore, due to the lack of venues, scheduling is very difficult and affects the progress of the competition. The organizers earnestly appeal to any organizations or individuals with table tennis rooms who are not participating in this year's league to provide assistance. Any number of times per week that a room can be borrowed would be welcome. Those who wish to support the event should contact Chen Linsheng at Hualian Tongle Club, 194 Nanjing East Road, or call Mr. Chen at 16129 in the afternoons.

### St. John's University Track and Field Meet Opens: 400m and Javelin Results Best; Women's Softball Throw to Be Highly Competitive Today

[Our Report] The two-day St. John's University Spring Track and Field Meet opened yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the university's athletic field in Fanhuangdu. Among the nine finals on the first day, the 400-meter race was the most exciting. Soccer star Jiang Weiliang burst out of his lane like a rocket, taking the lead after the first turn and running straight for the finish line. Individually, the redhead Lgoe Lee continued the dominance of the already-gone-to-America triathlon champion Balisi in track and field, winning first place in the 110-meter hurdles and third in the 100-meter race, scoring a total of 17 points and virtually guaranteeing first place in the individual standings.

### Group A Basketball League: Old Foreigners Clash Tonight

Two exciting Group A basketball league games will be held today. Encars will face Haiqing at 6:00 PM at the YMCA gymnasium on Nanjing West Road, refereed by Liu Hesheng and Tao Bolinji. Encars's performance in the league has not been ideal, but their play has been excellent. Rookie Bo Tou is especially dangerous. Moreover, the YMCA gymnasium is Encars's home court, and they are very familiar with it, so victory is within their grasp. Haiqing is the Charlton Fleet, one of the weaker teams in the US Navy. Tonight, they face the experienced and battle-hardened Encars, so their chances are slim.

### Group B Schedule: Three Matches

In addition to the Group A match between Encars and Haiqing at the YMCA, three Group B matches will be held at the gymnasium starting at 5:30 PM today. Ticket prices remain the same. The schedule is as follows:

Tielian vs. Ping Ping (Group B C) 5:30 PM  Youyi vs. Xiqing Blue (Group B A) 6:30 PM  Jingji vs. Huanan (Group B B) 7:30 PM

### Samsung's Strong Lineup Defeats Pan Team by Half a Dozen Goals: Tomorrow Afternoon, Title Contenders Zhongyi Face Longtou

Samsung Football Team was at full strength yesterday, defeating Pan Team 6-1 in the Democracy Cup. Every Samsung player worked hard and performed well. If they continue to field this strong lineup, they have a great chance of winning the Democracy Cup. Although Pan Team lost by six goals, the actual game was not one-sided. Their overall performance was respectable, especially Qian Ming and Sun Yongda, who had many beautiful moments. Only goalkeeper Song Boshou was slightly careless yesterday. The halftime score was 3-0, with Zhai Xigen scoring the first goal, followed by Zhang Jie and Lu Qingxiang. After the break, Fei Chunlin made it 4-0. Pan Team's forwards attacked strongly, creating dangerous situations in front of the Samsung goal, and Ha Zengguang eventually scored a goal. Afterwards, Lu Qingxiang displayed his power, scoring two more goals and increasing the lead to 6-1, which remained the final score. The entire match was clear and smooth, and both sides left happy.

Tomorrow afternoon at 4:30 PM, Zhongyi will face Longtou. Referee: Wang Lin; Linesmen: Wen Bin and Ma Youyu. Ticket prices have been adjusted to 2,000 yuan.

### Table Tennis Tips

— By Chen Linsheng

(5) Grip and Arm Movement

Let's first study the grip. There are many ways to grip the racket, broadly divided into two types: One is the reverse grip, where the wrist and racket are curved into a sickle shape, similar to holding a pen. The other is the horizontal grip, where the wrist and racket are in a straight line, maintaining a horizontal position.

In the horizontal grip, the handle and face of the racket are entirely controlled by the thumb. Sometimes, by bending the index finger joint and using the thumb to twist the racket, it can be converted into a reverse grip. However, once the grip is relaxed, it returns to the horizontal grip.

Of these two grips, the reverse grip is more convenient to use, while twisting the wrist with the horizontal grip is very unnatural. Therefore, fewer people adopt the horizontal grip.

This is a general overview. To accurately identify each person's grip, it can be said that everyone has their own unique style. I don't want to record all kinds of grips here, wasting space, but I want to present three very important points for everyone's reference:

1.  The grip should consider ease of use. Ease of use is certainly related to one's own habits, but in reality, one may not subjectively feel inconvenience, while it does hinder the development of skills. I once saw someone's grip where their hand was firmly gripping the hitting area, with the index finger lying on the edge of the racket, and the thumb and the other three fingers tightly pinching both sides. Objectively, this grip is less convenient to use.

2.  The grip should consider the full exertion of force. Hitting the ball doesn't necessarily require using full force with every shot. But, regardless of how we grip the racket, we must be able to use full force. Some people only use the thumb and part of the index finger to hold the racket. How much force can they possibly generate? This should be noted.

3.  Finger strength adjustment. When hitting the ball, the racket does not need to be gripped tightly from beginning to end. There should be an alternation between using force and not using force between shots and between stops. Only tightly grip at the moment of impact, when discerning the trajectory, aiming accurately, and hitting the ball. Otherwise, the fingers will easily become fatigued.

The most important aspect of arm movement is using the entire arm. Using the entire arm has two obvious benefits:

1.  More power. By using the entire arm, the range of motion is greater, the preparatory stance is more complete, and the force used when hitting the ball is naturally greater.

2.  Conserving energy. By using the entire arm, a larger range can be covered, the body moves more naturally, and the standing position is more stable. This avoids unnecessary running around, which are all obvious facts that prevent wasting energy. Conserving energy allows for longer practice. Furthermore, for natural movement, progress will definitely be faster. If the movement is limited to the wrist, it should be corrected immediately.

### This Year's "Wang Si Restaurant"

— Qian Taicheng

The "Wang Si Restaurant" at the entrance of Xingfu Temple in Changshu can truly be said to be famous throughout Jiangnan. Yi Junzu wrote poems about it, and Feng Zikai painted it. "Yellow chicken and white wine, watching the mountains and fields." Local regulars and tourists from afar all say: "Although the price is a bit high, it's truly delicious." Thus, the square in front of it is always crowded with cars, chartered vehicles, rickshaws, and bicycles on beautiful spring and autumn days. The "Yushan Restaurant," directly across from it, also has osmanthus white wine and oiled chicken on bamboo mats, but its business is not as good. Sometimes, when the "Wang Si Restaurant" is too crowded, the "Yushan Restaurant" gets some of the overflow. Therefore, some say: The "Wang Si Restaurant" is the best at making money in Changshu, especially at making money from outsiders. "Shanjingjian" and "Ma Yongzhai" are far behind.

How is "Wang Si Restaurant" this year? The wine flag is still raised, and the verdant Yushan Mountain still surrounds it. However, there are no cars in front of it, and only a few rickshaws. The sounds of guessing games and drinking orders are nowhere to be heard, and you can't see anyone helping a drunk person home. There are a few farmers drinking white wine downstairs, and few diners upstairs. Some say: "The feng shui of Wang Si Restaurant has changed! They will lose money this year!" Others say: "The security situation has been uncertain recently, so people from Shanghai are afraid to come." Actually, that may not be the case. Even during the period of occupation, when the Japanese were overbearing and imposing their will, implementing martial law one moment and checking "good citizen certificates" the next, the "Wang Si Restaurant" was still always full. People in Jiangnan generally don't care much about security. What really worries them is money. In recent years, everyone's money has changed from legal tender to "puppet currency," from "puppet currency" to legal tender, from legal tender to "Gold Yuan notes," and now the Gold Yuan notes are changing again. There are some who have profited from these changes, but most people have lost everything. Yellow chicken and white wine are naturally out of reach. Wang Si Restaurant thrived on the small bourgeoisie, and naturally it will decline along with them. In the early years of the Republic of China, Wang Si Restaurant was a village farmers' tavern. At that time, we could see farmers squatting barefoot, drinking and singing loudly as the sun set. Later, Wang Si Restaurant changed from a village farmers' tavern to a small bourgeoisie tavern, and finally became a tavern for bureaucrats, wealthy merchants. Perhaps the future Wang Si Restaurant will return to its roots? Returning to its roots is returning to truth and simplicity. When that time comes, we will see families helping drunk people home after the farmers have worked hard and the new harvest has been brought in. If Wang Si Restaurant continues to try to do business with people from Shanghai, it will surely decline.

### Old Heads and New Heads

— Wu Bao'an

Currently, the "Big Ocean" sound is making a commotion. Whether in speech, on the streets, in the markets, or in the newspapers, these four words are everywhere. I don't know who first came up with distinguishing silver dollars by the size of their "heads," but we know that distinguishing silver dollars by different "heads" has happened before, but it was the distinction between "new heads" and "old heads."

Long ago, at the beginning of trade between Guangzhou and foreign countries during the late Qing Dynasty, the first foreign currency to flow in were Spanish silver dollars with the portrait of King Carlos III (who ascended the throne in 1759). Mexican pesos and so on came much later. These silver dollars were more convenient than the silver ingots and taels then in circulation, as they were easy to hide and reliable, so they were very popular.

After Carlos III died, these silver dollars were no longer minted. Later, silver dollars of Carlos IV flowed in. However, because people were already accustomed to and had a deeper impression of the old silver dollars, their value was different from the newly arrived ones. Therefore, the silver dollars of Carlos III were more expensive than those of Carlos IV.

Because Chinese people didn't understand the strange Spanish, they called the former "old heads" and the latter "new heads."

### Change and No Change

— Gan Lai

The workers in this area are asking the boss to issue "Cost of living adjustments."

The old manager said, let all the shareholders consider it. The result of the consideration is: "This factory has decided to respond to all changes with no change. The request for the issuance of a cost of living adjustment should not be discussed."

### "Music in the Office"

— Suo Bei

Recently, a kind of clinking music has become prevalent in the offices of organizations large and small.

This music begins in the middle and at the end of the month, and then gradually fades away. When this strange music can still be heard, everyone generally has a smile on their face; conversely, everyone is silent and looks worried. The influence of music is profound!

This tune is extremely natural, pleasant to the ear, and sonorous. Everyone is happy to appreciate it and happy to listen to it. Some feel that its sound is sonorous, like playing a flute; some feel that its sound is like weeping and complaining, like a sad elegy, beat by beat, hitting the depths of everyone's heart. In short, this sound is too touching, enough to make people smile knowingly, and enough to make people burst into tears.

In ancient terms, this would be "heavenly music"; in new terms, this would be authentic "people's music," most likely to arouse people's heartfelt resonance. It is not art, nor is it any carefully crafted masterpiece of a "fantasy," but it often evokes different "fantasies" in each person. This fantasy is sometimes beautiful, bringing comfort to those who are suffering and depressed, and making those who have given up hope smile through their tears. They fantasize about "tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, rising, rising..."

Music in the office – a fantasy of real life.
