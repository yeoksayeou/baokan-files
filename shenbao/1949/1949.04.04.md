### The Beiping Peace Talks Gradually Unfold; Political Circles in the Capital Eagerly Await Success; Ceasefire Involves Numerous Difficulties in Troop Reorganization

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The peace talks are gradually unfolding in Beiping, and the political situation in the capital is temporarily calm. Apart from expressing particular concern about the tense war situation in Central China, political figures are eagerly anticipating the success of the Beiping peace talks. Although there are daily telegram communications between Nanjing and Beiping, due to the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) absolute secrecy regarding news of the negotiations, little is known to the outside world about the actual issues being discussed during the process. However, some people are actively awaiting a ceasefire order from Beiping to realize true peace. But observers believe that the primary task of the current peace talks is the ceasefire issue. A ceasefire necessarily involves troop reorganization, which is related to Mao Zedong's eight conditions. Therefore, a ceasefire is evidently no easy task. According to a certain supervisory committee member, based on the CCP's offensive in the past week, he suspects that the situation of "fighting and talking" may repeat itself. He expressed great pessimism about the future of the peace talks. This view, like the optimistic expectation that a ceasefire order will be issued soon, is full of contradictions. Both situations are ubiquitous among political figures in the capital.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Acting President Li, at 9:00 a.m. on the 3rd, convened a meeting with Ke Yingqin, Yan Xishan, Tong Guanxian, and Bai Chongxi to discuss major peace plans, which lasted until 12:00 p.m.

[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Our agency has received a wireless telephone report from Beiping, stating that formal peace talks have not yet begun. The representatives of both sides are only exchanging preliminary opinions. It is also learned that Acting President Li had a long-distance telephone conversation with the government's peace talk representatives in Beiping last night. Sources here revealed that the representatives of both sides are making private visits to each other, which are very friendly. Further news: The government will soon establish an advisory committee to make final decisions for the government delegation participating in the peace talks.

[Agence France-Presse Hong Kong Dispatch, 2nd] According to qualified left-wing sources, the Beiping peace negotiations may conclude as early as next week. It is understood that the CCP representatives, regarding the eight conditions proposed by Mao Zedong, may slightly ease only the point of punishing war criminals, but will not concede on the rest. The CCP General Headquarters has utilized the lull in the fighting over the past two months to complete preparations for crossing the Yangtze River, with the initial goal of cutting off the Jing-Hu (Nanjing-Shanghai) areas. Rumor has it that the CCP has purchased a considerable amount of gasoline in Hong Kong for its armored units. These units, equipped with equipment obtained from the government army, seem to be participating in the CCP's offensive in the Yangtze River basin.

### The China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Resumes Flights Between Beiping and Shanghai; No Major Problems in Principle; Wu Fucheng Returns to Shanghai and Speaks to Reporters; The Market in Beiping is Depressed, and People's Lives Have Become Simple and Austere

[Our Report] The CNAC special plane C64 type XT122, which carried the government peace delegation to Beiping, flew back to Shanghai at 7:10 p.m. last night. The plane arrived in Beiping at 3:10 p.m. on the 1st and was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai the next day, but was delayed by one day due to numerous matters, and did not leave Beiping until 2:30 p.m. yesterday. It arrived in Nanjing at approximately 5:00 p.m., stopped briefly, and arrived at Shanghai Longhua Airport at 7:10 p.m. Accompanying the plane back to Shanghai were only the original two pilots (captain and co-pilot), one telegraph operator, two flight attendants, and Wu Fucheng, the deputy director of the CNAC Shanghai ticket office, who intends to discuss air traffic issues with the CCP. The plane also brought a small amount of mail. After everyone disembarked yesterday, the security personnel at the scene conducted a very strict inspection, even the flight attendants' luggage was not exempt.

According to Wu Fucheng, he went to Beiping on behalf of CNAC to discuss air traffic issues with the CCP side. The initial contact was quite smooth, and there were generally no problems in principle for resuming flights. When reporters asked about specific measures, Wu only said that the future was optimistic and that more specific announcements would have to wait until he had submitted a report to the company authorities.

Wu also said that because the government peace delegation took the plane to Beiping, after receiving the telegram of the departure time from Nanjing, it was estimated that the arrival time in Beiping, so early in the morning, people from all relevant aspects of the CCP were waiting at the airport. However, because the plane flew to Qingdao to refuel, and there was a slight delay in Qingdao, the arrival time in Beiping was delayed. The CCP personnel waiting for the delegation waited for a long time and left first, so some of the advance personnel of the delegation remained on guard. The delegation was taken care of and housed at the Six Nations Hotel. As to whether the prelude to the peace talks between the KMT and the CCP has been opened after the government peace delegation arrived in Beiping, he said that because he did not ask about the peace talks, he could not answer. However, judging from the various situations after the arrival of the delegation, the two sides have actively prepared and deployed for the start of peace talks.

When reporters asked about his general impression of Beiping, Wu replied that, from the perspective of a foreigner who had been to Beiping several times, he felt that his activities in Beiping this time were more relaxed than before. After checking into the Six Nations Hotel, he could obtain an entry and exit permit, so there were no restrictions on entering and exiting and acting outside. The market in Beiping is quite depressed, but general shops are still open for business. The number of rickshaws on the road has decreased significantly, and those wearing Western suits are even rarer. It is also not easy to see women with makeup on the streets. The lives of ordinary citizens have become simple and austere. U.S. dollars are indeed very popular, with a market price more than twice that of Yuan heads.

### The Captain of the "Tianwang" Plane Participated in the War of Resistance Against Japan for Four Years

Shot Down a Total of Six Japanese Planes

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Chen Ruitian, the captain of the CNAC "Tianwang" plane, originally from Taishan, Guangdong, is a mixed-race Chinese-American who grew up in the United States. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he was the deputy captain of the Third Air Force Group. He participated in the war for four years and shot down six Japanese planes. His last air battle was in 1942, during the Battle of Lunluan Pass, when he was entangled with Japanese planes over Liuzhou. He was surrounded by six Japanese planes and his plane was destroyed. He parachuted, but was shot several times in the air by Japanese planes. After landing, he recovered from his injuries in a small house at the foot of a mountain near the Liuzhou Airport. Once, Japanese planes bombed the airport, and the bomb hit the mountain. The falling rocks destroyed the house. His wife, Wu Yuemei, was killed by the rocks while protecting her husband. After the victory, Chen Ruitian retired from the Air Force and joined CNAC.

### Wuhan City Defense Project Completed

[Our Hankou Dispatch, 3rd] Lu Daoyuan, the commander of the Wuhan garrison, has been inspecting the city defense works here for days. It is said that the entire project has been completed, and the safety of Wuhan can be guaranteed without worry.

### The CCP Yesterday Published a Commentary on the Unfortunate April 1st Incident; The Government Has Organized a Committee to Handle It Impartially

[Our Report] The CCP radio station broadcast a Xinhua News Agency editorial last night, entitled "The Nanjing Massacre and Peace Negotiations," giving the Nanjing government extremely fierce criticism. It pointed out that the April 1st student bloodshed occurred three hours after the Nanjing peace delegation left Nanjing, which clearly showed that the government supported the "military police and special agents" in their attacks on students. It indicated that the Nanjing government had no sincerity whatsoever in holding peace talks. The commentary emphasized that the so-called peace in the government's mouth was false and deceptive, and that its purpose was to preserve "reactionary forces" and buy time. The commentary was full of piercing words such as "war criminals," "murderous bandits," "this batch of beasts," "reactionaries," and "executioners," which have been rarely seen in recent CCP abusive texts. The agency bluntly accused Li Zongren, saying that in the two months since he took office on January 21, the government has not done a single good thing, nor has it done anything that truly benefits peace negotiations. Under the rule of Li Zongren, He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, and Zhang Zhizhong, war criminals have not been harmed at all, but peaceful people have been attacked and massacred. The agency pointed out that the "Nanjing Massacre" was the culmination of large-scale massacres of the people, so "it is impossible to hope that the war criminal group will lay down their butcher knives." It also said that the attitude of the Li Zongren, He Yingqin government and the Zhang Zhizhong delegation toward war criminals is a touchstone of whether they have sincerity for peace, and hoped that they could express their attitude on the issue of war criminals.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The government attaches great importance to the unfortunate incident of a conflict between students in Nanjing and the returning officers and soldiers of the Garrison Headquarters' Receiving Corps. It has ordered the Ministry of Education and the Garrison Command to each send senior officials to handle the matter jointly. The Ministry of Education has specially invited Shen Shaolun, an educational research committee member and current legislator, to represent the ministry, and has also invited the principals of various colleges and universities in Nanjing to organize a committee to assist in the investigation and study in detail, with a view to handling the matter impartially and in accordance with the law. The committee has invited Jin Da's president and Nanjing City Council Speaker Chen Yuguang to be the convener, and will begin immediately. It is hoped that the students of each school will remain calm during this period. As for the death of Cheng Luyi, a physics student at Zhongda (National Central University), Minister of Education Hang Liwu was extremely grieved, and visited Gulou Hospital this morning and dispatched school inspectors to assist in handling the aftermath.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] As the 3rd was a Sunday, the ten colleges and universities in Nanjing, including Zhongda, Zhengda, Jin Da, Jin Nuda, Conservatory of Music, Jianguo, Bianxiao, Oriental Language College, Drama College, and Pharmacy College, were outwardly calm. Only the "April 1st Bloodshed Aftermath Committee," composed of students from each school, distributed letters to compatriots across the country and letters to students across the country. Its documents to the KMT and CCP peace talk representatives in Beiping mainly explained the truth of the case, requested all parties to provide rescue and assistance, and repeatedly emphasized their courage and determination to oppose persecution, fight for freedom, fight for survival, and oppose false peace.

### Garrison Headquarters Spokesperson Refutes the Students' Written Statement

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Luo Chunbo, director of the Political Work Department and spokesperson of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, stated that the so-called written statement issued by the "April 1st Bloodshed Aftermath Committee of Nanjing Colleges and Universities" on the 2nd completely distorted the facts and reversed right and wrong. It was clear that a small number of unscrupulous professional students were manipulating the situation to create alarmism, expand the situation, and carry out their predetermined conspiracy. To clarify the truth for the public, he solemnly refuted it as follows: (1) The officers and soldiers of the Receiving Corps were all those who had been captured by the Communist army in successive battles and escaped or were trained by the Communist army for several months and then released. They arrived in Nanjing successively in the past half month. This headquarters was ordered to temporarily receive them, pending distribution or disposal. This is well known to the public, and anyone can go to the team for on-site investigation. However, professional students referred to the members of the Receiving Corps as "armed special agent executioners," attempting to blame the headquarters, and their ulterior motives can be imagined. (2) From the departure to the dissolution of the march, no incidents occurred along the way due to the meticulous protection of the headquarters. It was after the dissolution that the students went to the Receiving Corps to propagandize, which caused the conflict. The incident was accidental and the public witnessed it. However, professional students falsely accused the event of being a "planned beating and massacre," reversing right and wrong and making people gnash their teeth. (3) The headquarters made every effort in advance to dissuade the march, but the students did not listen. During the march, the headquarters provided meticulous protection. During the mutual attack, the commander-in-chief of the headquarters personally went to suppress it. Two officers of the office were slightly injured while dissuading the students. Afterwards, all the injured and beaten were rescued by the headquarters. The injured were sent to the hospital, and the uninjured were sent back to school by car. All the protected and sent students can prove this themselves. However, professional students stated that the injured and missing students were "arrested" and demanded their release. Such a reversal of black and white, treating friends as enemies, is truly conscience-stricken and regrettable. (4) As of now, the headquarters has not received any reports from school principals that any students are missing. Minister Hang of the Ministry of Education telegraphed on the afternoon of the 3rd that no students were missing. However, professional students claimed that 19 people were missing, which was clearly fabricated out of thin air in an attempt to expand the situation. (5) The truck used by the members of the Receiving Corps during the conflict is still parked on Zhongshan East Road and can be viewed at will. In short, this incident was entirely directed by a small number of professional students who were instructed by a certain party to conspire to disrupt public order and hinder peace. The current government is handling it carefully, and hopes that most students will not be exploited by a very small number of conspirators, but will concentrate on their studies to avoid trouble.

### Representatives of People's Organizations in the Capital Console Detained Military Officers

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Eight representatives from eleven people's organizations in Nanjing, including farmers, workers, women, etc., brought a large number of cigarettes and towels to the Daguang Road military officer receiving unit this morning at 10:00 a.m. to console the members of the team. Then, they went to the Garrison Headquarters detention center to console the military officer team members Li Peigen and others, who were detained due to the April 1st incident. According to the representatives after the consolation, the military officer team members all came from the CCP area. This time, unscrupulous people planned to resist the government. The team's courageous act was admirable. It is incomprehensible that the government arrested them for this indignant act. The people's organizations in Nanjing have decided to unanimously support them and request the government to release the arrested members immediately.

### The Court Sent Personnel to Examine the Body of Student Cheng Luyi

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The Capital District Court sent a special investigator to Gulou Hospital on the morning of the 3rd to examine the body of Cheng Luyi, a Zhongda student who died last night. The examination revealed that his right arm was broken by a wooden object, his frontal brain was shattered, and there was bleeding in the back of his head. Many Zhongda students went to mourn him today.

### Zhongda Decides to Have a Three-Day Holiday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] After the April 1st incident, although a portion of colleges and universities went on strike on the 2nd, Zhongda Medical College in Dingjiaqiao and others still continued classes as usual. It is reported that the Zhongda authorities have now decided to advance the spring holiday to start on the 4th for three days. Another portion of college and university students have guaranteed that they will focus on their studies in the future and continue classes as usual.

### CCP Broadcasts Statements from Various Parties Opposing the Atlantic Pact; Thirty Professors in the Capital Also Oppose the Pacific Pact

[Our Report] According to a CCP radio broadcast from Beiping on the 3rd, various democratic parties in China cooperating with the CCP issued a joint statement yesterday opposing the Atlantic Pact, condemning the treaty as threatening human peace. They also pointed out that the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom are currently attempting to extend the Atlantic Pact to the Pacific and called the attention of all parties. The statement expressed recognition of the Soviet Union as the main force for world peace and democracy, and expressed warm sympathy and support for it. The statement declared that they would resolutely fight against the initiators of aggressive wars and said that in the event of war, the aggressor countries of imperialism would inevitably fail, and victory would belong to the non-aggressor countries. The signatories of this joint statement are: Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Zhang Bojun, Chairman of the China Democratic League; Huang Yanpei, Executive Director of the Democratic National Construction Association; Ma Xulun, Executive Director of the China Association for Promoting Democracy; Tan Pingshan, Executive Committee Member of the United Association of Comrades of the Three People's Principles of the Chinese Kuomintang; Tong Bomin, Chairman of the Central Propaganda Committee of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Party; Li Zhangda, Central Committee Member of the China National Salvation Association; Cai Tingkai, Chairman of the China Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association; and Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the Chinese People's Public Party.

[Agence France-Presse Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] Thirty professors from Nanjing University issued a statement this evening opposing a "Pacific Pact" similar to the Atlantic Pact in Asia. They criticized the Atlantic Pact for "deepening the rifts in the Western world and bringing war closer," and accused the pact of being launched by Wall Street to "maintain the benefits it gained in World War II" and of violating the UN Charter. They earnestly requested the leaders of major countries to resolve all disputes within the UN organization. It is generally believed that the signatories represent the liberal elements of Nanjing's intellectual community and are not inclined towards the Communist Party.

### The Communist Forces on the Pinghan Railway Suffer Setbacks, the Iron Bridge Between Xinyang and Wushengguan is Destroyed, and the Nationalist Army in Anqing Still Holds Firm to its Original Position

[Our Newspaper, Huayuan, 3rd] The Communist Jianghan Column and the 10th Column, which had retreated to the vicinity of Huayuan and Anlu, have suffered heavy casualties, and their offensive has been thwarted. A strong unit of the Nationalist Army's Zhang Corps, after consolidating its positions on both sides of Huayuan, continued to extend its reach toward the area between Anlu and Yunmeng, and between Yingshan and Anlu, on the 3rd at dawn, in order to prevent reinforcements from the two counties of Suixian and Jingshan. There was a small contact at a location 25 li southeast of Anlu at noon. Furthermore, people from all walks of life in Xiaogan brought wine and meat to Huayuan on the 3rd to show their appreciation to the troops, and presented banners to the army commander, Li Benyi, to express their respect. It is also learned that a comfort delegation from Wuhan will soon arrive at the front lines to show their appreciation to the troops.

[Our Newspaper, Huayuan, 3rd] Military News: There was fierce fighting in the suburbs of Xinyang for the entire day on the 2nd. The gunfire only subsided in the evening. Zhu Qiping, the deputy commander of the 5th Pacification Zone, and Pang Mengtao, the chief of staff, led their troops to break through the siege around midnight on the 2nd and reached Guangshui. The 1st Regiment of the 197th Division, which was guarding the Huaihe River Bridge, the Gao Regiment of the 2nd Pacification Brigade stationed at Wulidian, and the five battalions of the 3rd Security Brigade stationed between Zhumadian and Queshan, defeated two Communist regiments and killed or wounded more than 2,000 Communist soldiers in 24 hours of fierce fighting. They also eliminated more than 1,000 local Communists. The 3rd Security Brigade of the Nationalist Army also suffered heavy casualties. Two battalion commanders of the Gao Regiment of the 2nd Pacification Brigade went missing, while another battalion commander led his troops to break through the encirclement after being wounded. Most of the two regiments of the 197th Division broke through the encirclement and retreated to the west of the railway. The Communist forces that besieged Xinyang included four regiments with unknown designations from Guangshan and Luoshan, more than 3,000 troops from the Jianghan Military Region, and two cavalry regiments from the Shahe Military Region coming from Zhengyang and Minggang, as well as more than 2,000 local Communists. About one regiment of Communist soldiers initially entered Xinyang City at midnight on the 1st, but quickly withdrew. On the afternoon of the 2nd, a large force arrived and completely took control. The Nationalist assault troops and the farmers' self-defense forces retreated to the southwestern suburbs to cover the Nationalist army's retreat.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 3rd] It is learned that the 14-arch bridge between Xinyang and Wushengguan has been blown up by the Communist army, causing significant losses.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 3rd] Transportation circles report: The area south of Wushengguan to Wangjiadian on the Pinghan Railway is still unstable. Northbound trains today only stopped at Huayuan.

[Our Newspaper, Wuhu, 3rd] The Battle of Anqing has entered its 12th day. After repeated setbacks, the Communist offensive on the 3rd has slowed down slightly. The Nationalist army is still firmly defending its original positions from Shizishan, Wulidun, and Qipanshan in the suburbs to the Agricultural and Forestry School. Furthermore, the National Army guarding the Tuqiao bridgehead north of Liujiadu in Tongling took the initiative to withdraw on the 3rd. Rumors that the bridge was captured by Chen Yi's 24th Army on the 1st do not correspond to the facts.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The fact that Anqing was able to turn danger into safety this time was largely due to the assistance of the naval fleet. According to Gui Yongqing, the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, the Navy has killed or wounded more than 3,000 Communist soldiers in the past ten days or so, while the Navy has only suffered one death and six injuries. Furthermore, the Navy has gathered about seven or eight warships and more than twenty landing craft near Anqing.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Rumors that Chen Yi has arrived in Yangzhou to plan military operations to cross the river have not been heard of by military authorities here.

### He Yingqin to Fly to Guangzhou the Day After Tomorrow, Ni Jiongcheng Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai Today to Handle the Handover

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 3rd] Wu Tiecheng stated: President He Yingqin is scheduled to arrive in Guangzhou on the 6th. He plans to return to Nanjing with He, and then fly to Taiwan. He also stated that Sun Ke will remain in Guangzhou for a short period of recuperation and will not go elsewhere for the time being.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] The Executive Yuan has decided to send Deputy Secretary-General Ni Jiongcheng to handle the administrative affairs and handover between Nanjing and Guangzhou. Mr. Ni is scheduled to take the night train to Shanghai on the 4th, and then fly to Guangzhou. He will return to Nanjing in about ten days. Mr. Ni's mission includes: (1) Handling the handover; (2) Allocating funds between Nanjing and Guangzhou; (3) Dividing administrative affairs between Nanjing and Guangzhou; (4) Handling the exchange of official documents between Nanjing and Guangzhou. Ye Gongchao, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Pang Songzhou, the Director of the Budget Bureau, will also accompany Mr. Ni.

### Bai Chongxi Returns to Shanghai to Take Charge, Held Lengthy Talks with Acting President Li and President He Before Leaving Nanjing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] As the Communist army, after retreating from Xinyang, launched successive southward attacks, the situation in Central China suddenly became tense. Bai Chongxi, who was summoned to Nanjing to discuss peace plans, held lengthy talks with Acting President Li and President He to plan the defense.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 3rd] Bai Chongxi flew back to Hankou from Nanjing at 4:30 PM on the 3rd, accompanied by Song Xilian, a commander of a certain pacification zone, Sun Guoji, the deputy chief of staff of the headquarters, and Yang Shouqiong, the deputy director of the office, and others.

Bai Chongxi's Remarks

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 3rd] After returning to Hankou from Nanjing, Bai Chongxi made the following remarks to reporters at 7:00 PM that evening: I came to Nanjing a few days ago on official business to report on my duties. I happened to meet the government's peace delegation heading north. Today, the realization of overall peace is not only the unanimous desire of the people and the government, but also the common hope of peace-loving countries around the world. Therefore, since the government advocated peace, it has made preparations in good faith to seek peace. In military terms, the National Army has ceased military actions since January of this year and is awaiting orders in its original defense areas. What we regret most is that the Communist army's military actions have not ceased. The Communist army is advancing south on multiple routes. Even the troops of Lin Biao and Nie Rongzhen, far away in North China, are launching a major southward advance, gradually pressing towards the north bank of the Yangtze River. In the Anhui region, more than 30,000 troops are attacking Anqing, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. In the Central China region, the Communist army is successively attacking Queshan, Xinyang, Kaishengguan, and Huayuan from Zhumadian. Our army is successively moving south from Zhumadian. Although the CCP has invited the government's peace delegation to Beiping and started negotiations on April 1st, its military actions have not stopped at all. Recalling the failure of past political consultations, which were caused by negotiations and fighting at the same time, leading to no results and continuous warfare until today, if we repeat the same mistake, the prospects for peace will inevitably disappoint both Chinese and foreign people. We earnestly hope that both sides will respect public opinion, take the preservation of the nation's vitality and the people's livelihood as the top priority, meet each other with sincerity, and immediately cease military actions in order to conduct sincere negotiations and achieve true peace as soon as possible.

Editorial

### Children's Rights and Social Responsibility - A Message for Children's Day

Spring has arrived, and all things are flourishing. We are holding the annual Children's Day at this time, symbolizing the beautiful future of children. Indeed, children are to humanity as spring is to the four seasons. We want them to carry forward the bright side of our generation and eradicate the dark side from its roots.

Chinese children are suffering along with the disaster-ridden and calamity-laden country. It is truly the fault of our generation of adults. Today, tens of thousands of children are in a state of near death, exhaustion, and weakness. Many bedsides are without the soothing words of a loving mother, and many dining tables are without the company of a father. They have lost nourishment and even more so, education. Not to mention the other rights that children should enjoy.

Guaranteeing children's rights is originally a social responsibility. Considering the Zhou Li, among the twelve policies for famine relief, there are six for ensuring rest: "Cherishing the young, providing for the elderly, providing for the poor, comforting the impoverished, alleviating illness, and securing the wealthy," and the cause of cherishing the young is listed first among the six policies. Mencius said: "Love my young ones, and extend that love to the young ones of others." This is sufficient evidence that Chinese society has always shouldered the responsibility for children. The West also has this same situation. The Geneva Declaration of the Rights of the Child years ago listed the many rights of children and the heavy responsibilities of society, which were rarely seen in past history. However, human habits are limited to paying attention to today and neglecting tomorrow, and rarely paying attention to how the current situation will affect the future. If we think more about tomorrow, society can reduce selfishness and develop a greater interest in the next generation. The happiness of the future sometimes requires sacrificing the joy of the present. If we can pay attention to the future, then any sacrifice in the present will be willingly made.

Today, everyone is talking about social policy, either admiring the Soviet Union or wanting to imitate Britain, and naturally feels that anything else is out of fashion. However, it must be known that social policy places an increasingly higher responsibility on children; some of these responsibilities, unfortunately, society has not fully recognized. We believe that Chinese society in an era of turmoil should have the following minimum responsibilities for the basic rights of children: (1) preservation of life; (2) promotion of health; (3) opportunities for play; (4) prohibition of child labor; (5) implementation of education. These few things cannot be accomplished by shouting slogans on Children's Day, nor can they be realized by simply talking about social policy. Everyone must earnestly advocate and work hard to see results.

(1) Preservation of Life The first requirement of children to society is the right to proper care during the fetal and infant stages. This is the right to survival. We must preserve the life of the fetus from the beginning until it becomes independent. He has the right to good opportunities in life. Bringing a child into the world is a solemn and dignified matter, and we must do everything possible to prevent his premature death. There is no greater tragedy in the universe than the cruel destruction of a healthy human life. Primitive societies did not value human life, and abortion, abandonment of infants, and infanticide occurred frequently. Many Chinese children still die unnatural deaths, especially during times of war, which torment mothers, waste production, and ruin young lives. Young lives die from artillery fire, bad customs, ignorance of hygiene and lack of medicine, and some are buried in poverty where "white-haired parents grieve, black-haired children weep, wives cry from hunger, and children wail from cold." Many tender seedlings are intentionally or unintentionally fettered and sacrificed by adults.

(2) Promotion of Health The reason we promote health is that health is the foundation for being a person and doing things. Without health, it is impossible to achieve the highest efficiency of work; without health, it is impossible to talk about a fulfilling and rich life. Without health, education and training are almost impossible to implement. Physical and mental health are often permanently damaged due to poor health. We want to make children grow up strong, relying entirely on nutrition before the age of five. During the fetal period, there is only nourishment and no education, so science only calls it fetal nourishment and not fetal education. Fetal nourishment has already been paid attention to in the I Ching. For example, Confucius said in his preface to the Zhou Yi: "Things cannot be un-nourished when they are young, therefore they are received with need, which is the way of eating and drinking." In modern times, when competition is intensifying, children's bodies must be able to adapt to the urgent needs of the new era. Society should also provide good correction and training for weak and disabled children to reduce the number of incompetent people in society.

(3) Opportunities for Play All animals enjoy playing. This is the basic instinct of children. Infants are full of play. From morning to night, whether they are eating, dressing, or sleeping, they are all playing. Play has infinite benefits and is very important for self-development. It can promote the physiological and psychological development of the whole child and has social value. Cultivating people's emotions through play is especially needed today. Cooperation with others and making people happy are the true functions of play. Society must greatly expand the opportunities for healthy children to play. For special children and problem children, we must use play to find a way out for their spirits. Weak children have insufficient ability and cannot concentrate their thoughts, so they should be encouraged to play more. Play is liberation from work to freedom, and gives appropriate leisure time from the classroom. Without sufficient space or equipment, it is difficult to complete children's social training.

(4) Prohibition of Child Labor Prohibiting immature children from hard work is also an important responsibility of society. Children must be rescued from the hard work of earning money. Employing children in factory work often leads to irreparable consequences. Dangers to health and development, obstruction of career opportunities, psychological stagnation, loss of self-development opportunities, stimulation of crime, and ultimately moral degradation. Prohibiting child labor is full of profound meaning for the next generation and has become a major social problem. Before reaching adulthood, every child needs the protection of parents and society in many ways. Society should have the power to restrain factories from using child labor and allow them to escape from fire and water and ascend to comfort. After that, work must adapt to higher social standards. After they stop working, they should be provided with educational opportunities, but they cannot be allowed to be lazy. Laziness is the root of all evil, and laziness is worse than not working.

(5) The Need for Education Education is to give children systematic development. The government establishes "schools and academies" to store talents for the country, and parents want "peach and plum breezes" and their children to be successful. The difference between civilization and barbarism lies in the judgment of education. The more advanced society is, the more refined the division of labor is, and the more indispensable education is. Literacy is the main part of education. Illiteracy leads to a sea of ​​ignorance and ignorance, which not only affects oneself but also affects the entire society. China has always encouraged "destroying families to build schools," which shows that society bears the responsibility for education. Now, there are many people who want to destroy schools to build families, and even public elementary schools and kindergartens have to charge fees, and sometimes the fees are even higher than public universities and colleges, which is truly a strange thing throughout the ages. The education that children receive must especially focus on language training, and even more on vocational training and moral cultivation. Otherwise, education may even create high-level idlers and social bad guys!

To summarize the above five points, regarding the preservation of life, society should urge the government to strictly enforce prohibitions on abortion and infanticide, recognize the status of illegitimate children, and set up new-style nurseries in the spirit of orphanages. To promote health, the main focus should be on implementing health education and promoting a public medical system. Society should set up more playgrounds, promote outdoor entertainment, and enrich school play equipment to ensure that every child has the opportunity to play. Although child labor and education are matters of the state, society should also contribute money and effort to create public opinion and assist the government's shortcomings. In short, the welfare of children is the welfare of society, and the rights of children are the responsibility of society. On this year's Children's Day, we appeal to people from all walks of life with a heavy heart to look further ahead and give more warmth to the next generation!

The silver market in Xi'an is particularly tight, with interest rates reaching 40%. Silver dollars have fallen to 13,000, and gold can be traded for 50 silver dollars. Because gold in the Lanzhou market is 65 silver dollars per tael, smugglers secretly transport silver dollars and cash to Lanzhou to exchange for gold.

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 3rd] The gold and silver market here has doubled compared to the previous three days due to the rise in Hong Kong silver prices, the issuance of large banknotes, and traffic disruptions. Gold is 1.7 million per tael, and silver dollars are 25,000 yuan per piece.

### US Senate Debates Aid to China Issue, No Agreement Reached on Either Side, Knowland Opposes Aiding Communist-Controlled Areas

[Central News Agency, Washington, 2nd] The US Senate began debating the issue of aid to China on the 2nd. Republican Senator Knowland proposed an amendment to the European Recovery Act, advocating that the economic aid to China program be extended until February 15 of next year, but that no aid be given to Communist-controlled areas. The current aid to China program is scheduled to expire at midnight on the 2nd. Knowland's amendment was immediately opposed by Senators Connally and Thomas. Connally and others said that the President should have the right to decide on the distribution of foreign aid. Knowland firmly opposed supplying Communist-controlled areas with industrial equipment, fuel, etc., and said, "This point should be clearly stipulated in the bill." Connally accused Knowland's speech of having political implications, while Knowland accused the US policy in China of greatly harming the Chinese government and fueling the CCP's momentum. He said: "Since we can adopt an anti-communist policy in Europe, why are we indifferent to the red threat to China's 400 million people?" The Senate adjourned soon after the debate and scheduled to discuss Knowland's amendment again on the 4th. The only difference between Knowland's amendment and Connally's amendment is that the former prohibits aid to Communist-controlled areas. On the House side, Republican members demanded that the Democrats cancel the provisions in the Kee bill that they opposed. Both sides have agreed to discuss it again on the 4th. The provision in the Kee bill that allows the President to allocate the remaining $54 million in aid funds without regard to the provisions of last year's Aid to China Act will be cancelled at that time. After this revision, the Kee bill can receive the overwhelming majority of support in the House. Republican Congressman Voorhis said: "Although the $54 million in aid to China is small in amount, it has its value psychologically. This can reaffirm our policy of encouraging China to resist the Communists and maintain its independence. China is in a difficult situation today and urgently needs our encouragement and support. Therefore, we cannot allow in our legislation any words that will discourage China or indicate a willingness to aid a coalition government with Communist participation."

### Military Personnel Use "Sichuan Silver Dollars" to Exchange for Gold Jewelry; Local Jewelers Refuse, Causing Disputes

[Special Dispatch from Zhenjiang, March 3] On the morning of the 3rd, more than ten military personnel from a certain unit attempted to exchange "Sichuan silver dollars" and various types of foreign silver coins for gold jewelry at local jewelers such as Shihua Jewelry, based on the Shanghai Central Bank's published regulations that silver dollars should be accepted regardless of their version. However, the jewelers refused to accept them due to the significant price difference between "Sichuan silver dollars" and "Big Head" silver dollars, claiming they were unaware of the current exchange rates. This led to repeated disputes, and by the afternoon, the jewelers had essentially ceased operations. The County Chamber of Commerce has requested the Provincial Government and the Zhenjiang branch of the Central Bank to study exchange methods so that businesses can potentially resume operations on the 4th.

### The Historic North Atlantic Treaty; Signing Ceremony to Be Held Today; Truman to Attend and Deliver a Speech; Ceremony Proceedings to Be Broadcast Worldwide in Various Languages

[Reuters, Washington, March 3] All eyes worldwide are focused on Washington today as representatives from twelve nations are set to sign the historic North Atlantic Treaty within hours. Although today is a public holiday, the State Department, from Secretary of State Acheson downwards, is operating as usual, preparing for Monday's signing ceremony. Hundreds of journalists from around the world have gathered in Washington to attend tomorrow's grand event. President Truman has completed the speech he will deliver at the signing. Observers believe that Truman will affirm in a firm tone that Britain's traditional policy of isolation will henceforth be a thing of the past. The foreign ministers of the other eleven nations of the treaty are also busy preparing speeches for tomorrow's signing, and are expected to declare their nation's full support for the Atlantic Treaty and to emphasize Article 5, which provides for collective resistance to armed aggression. The entire signing ceremony is expected to last about an hour. Ambassadors to Washington from various nations have been invited to observe the ceremony, but it is expected that Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin will not wish to attend.

[Associated Press, Washington, March 3] The State Department announced today that the proceedings of the Atlantic Treaty signing ceremony will be broadcast to the world in 43 languages by major shortwave radio stations. "The Voice of America" will begin broadcasting from the State Department Auditorium, where the signing is taking place, at 7:45 p.m. (standard time) on the 4th.

[Reuters, Washington, March 3] When the Atlantic Treaty is signed here on the 4th, the first signatory will be Belgian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak, followed by Canadian Foreign Minister Pearson, Danish Foreign Minister Rasmussen, French Foreign Minister Schuman, Icelandic Foreign Minister Benediktsson, Italian Foreign Minister Sforza, Luxembourg Foreign Minister Bech, Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker, Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange, Portuguese Foreign Minister Mateus, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and U.S. Secretary of State Acheson.

[Reuters, Washington, March 2] The first action taken by the foreign ministers of the Atlantic nations at their meeting here today was to formally reject Soviet accusations that the North Atlantic Treaty is an aggressive tool that violates the UN Charter. The foreign ministers issued a joint response to the Soviet Union's protest note on the Atlantic Treaty, emphasizing that the treaty is purely defensive in nature, aimed solely at armed aggression, and not directed against any one nation or group of nations. They also pointed out that the opinions listed by the Soviet Union in its protest were identical to those expressed by the Soviet Foreign Ministry on January 22. This shows that the Soviet government's views on this matter did not arise from examining the nature and content of the treaty, but were based on other reasons. The content of the Atlantic Treaty provides the best answer to this kind of distorted accusation by the Soviet Union. The content of the treaty clearly indicates that the treaty is purely defensive in nature and is fully in line with the spirit and wording of the UN Charter.

### Member Nations Conduct Preliminary Study on Establishing Permanent Joint Defense Organization; Differences Between the "Big Three" on the West German Issue Remain to Be Resolved

[Reuters, Washington, March 3] The twelve foreign ministers, at their meeting today, have decided that the permanent committee of the Atlantic Treaty should be established only after the treaty has been ratified by the original seven signatory governments. This indicates that after the signing ceremony on April 4, military experts will continue detailed discussions on the final form of the military organizations under the treaty. These discussions will take place separately in Washington, at the location of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Board, and in London, at the location of the permanent military committee of the Western European Union.

[Reuters, Washington, March 3] The twelve foreign ministers of the Atlantic Treaty are expected to decide this week on the permanent organizations to be established to implement the treaty. The existing military organizations of the Western European Union, including the Defense Committee composed of the five defense ministers, the permanent military committee, and its design and supply organizations, will serve as models for the organizations to be established under the Atlantic Treaty. A major issue is whether the permanent organizations under the Atlantic Treaty should be located in Europe or the United States, most likely either in Washington or London. The preliminary discussions held by the foreign ministers here in recent days have focused on examining the weaknesses in the implementation of the treaty, the main ones being: (1) Germany's relationship with the treaty; (2) The military involvement of the Netherlands in Indonesia and France in Vietnam; (3) The Greek civil war, which involves both the UK and the US; (4) The issue of Italian colonies. Regarding the German issue, the crux is how to reconcile the traditional fear of German re-aggression held by France, Belgium, and Luxembourg with the current practical situation. Western nations, especially the United States, are increasingly recognizing that if Germany cannot be quickly revitalized, economic turmoil will make it easier for communist forces to infiltrate. Furthermore, from a military point of view, the Atlantic Alliance cannot avoid having weaknesses in its defense if it does not have a politically and economically stable West Germany as its bulwark. Currently, Acheson, Bevin, and Schuman are studying this matter in order to ensure that the revitalization of West Germany does not conflict with France's fear of German re-aggression. Regarding the Indonesian issue, since the Netherlands accepted the Security Council's suggestion and agreed to negotiate directly with the Republic of Indonesia, it shows that the opinions of the Netherlands and the United States are gradually converging. In Greece, due to the discord between the Cominform and Yugoslavia, and the former's support for the Greek communists, Yugoslavia may cease its aid to the Greek guerrillas. Due to the delicate military and political situation there, it requires careful discussion by both the UK and the US. Although the Italian colonies are awaiting resolution by the United Nations, if the nations of the Atlantic Treaty cannot reach an agreement, then there is no hope for an early resolution of this issue.

### British Experts on German Issues Fly to Washington to Assist in Negotiations

### Tito Denounces Malicious Propaganda from All Sides

[Associated Press, Belgrade, March 2] Yugoslav Prime Minister Tito, currently on vacation on the island of Brioni, delivered a speech on the 31st to 150 representatives of the people of Yugoslavia, Croatia, and Slovenia. He adopted a defiant and independent stance for the first time, denouncing the lies and slanders against Yugoslavia by Western capitalist countries and Eastern socialist countries. Tito frankly declared that the anti-Yugoslav propaganda is not enough to bother us, nor can it make us deviate from the path we are currently following.

### U.S. Congress to Delay Adjournment; Important Bills Have Yet to Be Passed; Senate Begins Debate on Next Round of Funding for European Aid Program

[Associated Press, Washington, March 3] The 81st U.S. Congress, which opened on January 3 of this year, has now been in session for a full three months, but the most important bills have not been decided, and some have not even been discussed. Therefore, the session may be extended to July or August. In March, Congress passed 30 bills, but few of them are important.

Important bills, such as the anti-communist plan, the foreign aid bill, and military aid to the Atlantic Treaty nations, all require careful discussion. President Truman's various domestic construction plans also need to be discussed one by one. Congress may temporarily adjourn at the end of June and convene a special session in the fall to discuss the pending issues.

[Reuters, Washington, March 3] The Senate today debated the next round of funding for the Marshall Plan. There are still 27 amendments to be discussed, and the first phase of the Marshall Plan expired today, April 3.

### U.S. Senator Proposes Suspending Loans to the Netherlands

[Associated Press, Washington, March 3] According to reliable sources on the 3rd, Republican Senator Brewster overturned a compromise amendment to the European Recovery Program during the Senate meeting on the evening of the 2nd. The amendment concerned the Netherlands and its war in Indonesia. The amendment, proposed by Vandenberg, a Republican foreign policy spokesman, and endorsed by the State Department, advocated suspending the Netherlands' share of the recovery fund only if the UN Security Council ordered sanctions against the Netherlands because of the situation in Indonesia. However, Brewster opposed it and strongly urged the Senate to pass his amendment, which advocated suspending the Netherlands' four hundred million dollars recovery fund. Vandenberg publicly declared that he opposed putting immediate pressure on the Netherlands because such action would place the United States in a position of taking unilateral sanctions outside the UN framework.

### UN General Assembly to Open Tomorrow; US Studies Response Strategies; Acheson Provides Instructions to the Delegation

### Old Shop in Wusong Forced to Close Due to Usurious Loans

Da Feng Department Store at 72 Tongxing Road in Wusong was originally a decades-old family business with a good reputation. The owner, Huang Defeng, was recently plagued by usurious loans, resulting in significant losses and making it impossible to maintain the business. Consequently, on the 19th of last month, he issued dozens of bad checks to various parties, obtained funds, and then fled without a trace the following day.

This figure does not include Shanghai Datung Bank and other parties. It is reported that the creditors, together with the liquidator, inspected the assets of Da Feng yesterday and estimated their value at only over 10 million yuan. Therefore, the debts could not be distributed proportionally, and efforts are still being made to pursue the individual responsible.

### Murder Case in Jiangjiaqiao, Pudong Solved; Owner of Fried Goods Shop Claims Deceased Was a Thief

[Our Dispatch] On the morning of the 1st of this month, an unidentified male corpse was discovered beside a small river in Jiangjiaqiao, Pudong. The police station in charge dispatched officers to investigate and pursue the murderer. Unexpectedly, Fan Lewu, a staff member of the judicial section of the Songshan Police Station, received a report some days ago that the deceased had been killed by Mei Bingqi, the owner of the Xiangtai fried goods shop at No. 18 Jiangjiaqiao. He obtained approval from his superiors to investigate. By that time, the shop owner and staff had already left. Later, evidence from a female servant, He Xiaomei, revealed that she heard someone calling for help in the shop that night, but when she went downstairs to investigate, she was stopped by the shop staff. Finally, the police found a rope hanging from the beam in the kitchen of the shop. They returned to Shanghai and reported the incident and immediately investigated Mei's whereabouts. The day before yesterday, they learned that Mei was hiding at 473 Fuxing East Road. They went there at 6:00 AM yesterday, and Mei had not yet gotten up. Upon hearing that the police had arrived, he attempted to escape through the window, but was still apprehended. After being taken to the station for questioning, he flatly denied any involvement, but claimed that the deceased was a thief who had been apprehended and beaten by his shop staff that night. He was accidentally killed, and afterwards the corpse was placed in a sack and dumped beside a nearby stream. The next day, the two shop staff fled to Chongming out of fear of punishment. Based on the confession, the police station detained Mei and dispatched officers to Chongming to pursue the fugitives.

### Yang Chuo'an Broadcasts, Calls for Expanding Grain Storage; Grain Rationing for May and June to be Half from the U.S. and Half from Domestic Sources

[Our Dispatch] Yang Chuo'an, Director of the Emergency Grain Procurement and Storage Committee, was invited by the Public Opinion Survey Committee to broadcast a speech entitled "Review and Prospects of Urban Grain Rationing Work" on Shanghai Radio Station at 8:00 PM last night. He focused on analyzing the supply situation of urban grain rationing sources, pointed out the serious nature of the current grain shortage, and called on all parties to expand grain storage and conserve consumption.

Furthermore, Yang Chuo'an, Director of the Emergency Grain Procurement and Storage Committee, recently told reporters about the grain sources for urban rationing, saying that according to the general agreement of the Sino-U.S. grain exchange letters, 40% of the urban rationing should be borne by the U.S. and 60% should be raised domestically. The domestic part is entrusted by the committee to the China Farmers, China Cooperative Bank, Jiangsu Agricultural Bank, and China Trust Bureau to purchase from domestic and foreign producing areas. The insufficient amount is entrusted to grain merchants to purchase. At present, domestic procurement and transportation are quite difficult due to the impact of the war and the obstruction of local authorities. He said that from July of last year to the end of March of this year, a total of 467,000 tons of rice had been rationed in the three cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and 170,000 tons of flour had been distributed in the three cities of Pingjin and Qingdao, of which more than 250,000 tons were supplied by our side, accounting for 39%. Shanghai distributed more than 300,700 tons of rice during this period, of which more than 152,000 tons were from the United States. Yang said that the rationing for this period was extended to the end of April after consultations between China and the United States. Later, with the consent of the U.S. personnel in China, the rationing of grain in the four cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao, and Guangzhou was extended to the end of June. It was also agreed that the grain sources for the May and June rationing would be split equally between China and the United States. Yang announced that the rationing for April had been properly completed. The grain sources for May and June are being actively prepared.

### Myanmar War Affects Rice Supply

[Our Dispatch] Rice prices have soared in recent days, and the lives of ordinary people are extremely worrying. All sectors are extremely concerned about the supply of rice sources in the city. Although the Economic Cooperation Administration has in principle agreed to extend the city's rice ration to the end of June, the development of the civil war in Myanmar, one of the main sources of rice, may have a significant impact on the source. It is reported that at the end of last month, a rice-carrying ship sailed from Shanghai to Yangon, which could carry 22,000 tons to Shanghai. It is difficult to predict whether it can still be supplied continuously in the future. In addition to purchasing from Myanmar and Siam, the Economic Cooperation Administration will also have two or three commercial ships transporting rice from the United States to China recently. According to the person in charge of the administration, the rice ration can be maintained until the end of June no matter what, and what will happen starting in July will depend on the decision in Washington. According to statistics, from July 1, 1948 to the end of March of this year, the Economic Cooperation Administration allocated funds to purchase and distribute approximately 390,000 tons of rice and grain worth US$62.5 million to major cities across the country. In the case of this city, from July 1, 1948 to March 31 of this year, a total of approximately 400,000 tons of rice were rationed in the city, of which approximately 230,000 tons were supplied by the Economic Cooperation Administration and approximately 170,000 tons were raised by the municipal government, indicating that more than half of the city's rice consumption depends on the administration's supply.

### Don't Waste This Meaningful Day: Two Major Child Welfare Organizations Raise Funds, Deeply Hope All Sectors Will Contribute Generously

[Our Special Feature] "Children's Day," such a familiar holiday, year after year, time after time, we see the same old ways of "celebrating" and sing the same old songs about "children being the pillars of society and the future masters of the country." If someone asks: Where can we find the masters of China? Ironclad reality will answer: "Abandoned babies by the roadside, beggars on the street, little thieves everywhere..." Gentlemen will inevitably cover their noses and pass by, most even cursing, "Little bastards!" This familiar picture is the most poignant satire of this familiar holiday today!

"Children's Day" comes every year, but the reporter hopes that this year's Children's Day will be extraordinary. Those who sincerely seek the well-being of children have been working hard silently for several years to create a paradise for orphans. Now this piece of land, after hard work, has taken shape. In order to make it blossom and bear fruit, they have to ask the public to irrigate and support it. The reporter will briefly introduce this, hoping that the benevolent people will relieve suffering and difficulties, not waste this meaningful day, and contribute generously to create a better future for the next generation!

Selling Sanmao's Famous Paintings for Child Welfare Funds

Membership fees can be sent directly to 988 Linsen Middle Road, or call 70006, extension 7, and the organization will send someone to collect them.

Two Different Sentiments Intertwined with New Vitality

In addition, the reporter would also like to introduce the Shanghai Poor Children's Work-Study Institute, which will hold a special program at major radio stations throughout the city today to broadcast fundraising for the institute's expenses, expand the accommodation of destitute children, and lay the foundation for the future motherland.

The Shanghai Poor Children's Work-Study Institute is still an unfamiliar term to Shanghai residents because it is a newly established child welfare organization. Although it has been around for more than a year, all the equipment is pitifully simple. The institute is located on Jiangwan New City Road. More than ten years ago, it was the predecessor of Jiangwan Lida College, where Feng Zikai taught. After the devastation of the "January 28th" and "August 13th" artillery fires, only a rubble field remained. Over the past year and a half, through the painstaking management of President Ding Fubao and Vice President Wang Jingfu, the desolate paradise—the Shanghai Poor Children's Work-Study Institute—has been established. Today, in this desolate ruin, 75 destitute children are accommodated. Every day there is the sound of reading aloud, every day there is the sound of "Hang yo, hang yo" of labor. Different sentiments intertwine to form a group of new vitality.

Funds Cannot be Maintained; Running Out of Rice

However, due to limited funding, this paradise is extremely pitiful. In addition to dozens of thatched cottages, there is nothing of value in the paradise. There is water, but no electricity. When it gets dark, the children have to sleep on the ground. Although the material conditions are so difficult, the children's spirits are happy. They eat one meal and two congees a day, with freshly grown vegetables. Everyone strictly abides by the discipline of group life. They were all born poor and never dared to have any extravagant expectations for life. But the thatched cottages cannot withstand wind and rain, and they are also prone to fires. So when they discover that even the lowest conditions for survival will be taken away, they are afraid. Due to the rapid increase in the cost of living, the limited funds cannot be maintained. If they do not receive assistance from all sectors, they will soon run out of rice.

Recently, Senator Zhang Zhongyuan took over as chairman of the institute's board of directors. He is determined to speak out for those orphans. Improving the lives of the orphans in the institute is an urgent task, and how to make full use of the existing environment to expand the number of orphans accommodated is also a meaningful good deed. Because the Shanghai Poor Children's Work-Study Institute has 15 mu of open space, and only accommodates 75 orphans due to economic constraints. If it is fully utilized, it can accommodate many times more than this number. Moreover, there are countless more orphans in Shanghai who should be accommodated.

Preparing to Add Buildings to Expand Accommodation of Destitute Children

A month ago, a small-scale broadcast was held to raise emergency funds for the Poor Children's Work-Study Institute, and the results were not bad. A lot of rice, flour, clothing, and stationery were donated. Someone even donated 20 eggs, explaining that it was for the children to have a treat. In addition, an old man listened to the broadcast and personally went to the institute in Jiangwan to visit, and then happily donated 20,000 yuan of his private savings. 20,000 yuan is not a large sum, but what is valuable is his enthusiasm and willingness to help others.

Based on the spirit of human mutual assistance, under the instigation of Senator Zhang, it was decided to hold a large-scale fundraising event. Today, all the radio stations in Shanghai, including public and private ones, will voluntarily broadcast for the Shanghai Poor Children's Work-Study Institute. Their goal is 120 million yuan, and then build ten buildings for the orphans, expand accommodation, and cultivate talent for the country.

Oh, blessed people! When you are living in a warm atmosphere, relieving boredom with the radio, may you move your compassionate heart and save those hungry children!

### Literacy Classes Benefit Poor Children; Little Teachers Volunteer to Teach

[Our Dispatch] In order to help poor children who are out of school have the opportunity to read, the three Children's Welfare Centers of the China Welfare Fund, under the direction of the Sun News Agency, established literacy classes a long time ago. The poor children who signed up were extremely enthusiastic. The three centers were open from morning to night and still not enough to accommodate them. The eight or nine teachers were too busy to cope, so they adopted and implemented the "Little Teacher" system advocated by Tao Xingzhi, asking the children to teach what they had learned to their parents and neighbors. This not only solved the problem of teachers, but also cultivated the spirit of self-reliance and mutual assistance in these children. To date, the trial implementation of this Little Teacher system has fully proven to be a success. The Welfare Fund's literacy classes have expanded to 100 classes. Due to the large number of classes, the Welfare Center was unable to arrange for them all. Except for 30 classes that are held in the centers, the remaining 70 classes are held in the kitchens, attics, rooms, courtyards, or open spaces that the Little Teachers can find in their own homes. These are called Family Literacy Classes. The center provides each class with a small blackboard and a specially compiled "General Reader for Old and Young" textbook. Ten or twenty poor children surround a broken table, and the Little Teacher teaches the class. Those who don't have a table use door panels from shops as a substitute. Those who have classes outdoors bring broken stools from home to sit on and listen to the lectures. These 70 Family Literacy Classes are now distributed in the slums and shantytowns of Pudong and Puxi. The children being taught include those who set up stalls and do small business, pick up garbage, and push carts at the bridgehead. The First Children's Welfare Center on Suzhou Road has a more special class that is entirely composed of street beggars, a total of fifteen or sixteen people, who also have classes every day.

Wang Sizu, deputy director of the Changshu Police Station, personally went to Hangzhou to conduct an on-the-spot investigation, and reopened the coffin in Shanghai for re-examination, which has proven that the dismembered corpse is definitely not Shui Yao Chen. Recently, Shui's family learned that Shui is still alive. It is reported that Shui, in Shanghai, lost money in business and was disheartened. He used the pretext of going to Hangzhou to mourn his teacher Sun Yici's death, abandoned his family and left home. He went from Hangzhou to a large temple in Fenghua to shave his head and become a monk. After Shui's younger sister Shui Xiuqiang and her eldest daughter learned of this, they went to Hangzhou this morning and then to Ningbo to visit, intending to persuade him to return to secular life in Shanghai and reunite with his family. The above news was confirmed by the Changshu branch, so the current investigation target of the case has been narrowed down to the last person. After other agencies discovered this missing person, judging from various references, it is likely that he is the dismembered corpse. One of the suspects in the case has been under surveillance for several days, and it has been found that this person's whereabouts are extremely secretive and he has plans to leave Shanghai. Active efforts are being made to collect relevant evidence, and action will be taken in the short term. The unveiling of this mysterious headless case is not far off.

### A Glimpse of the Changxing Coal Mine Area

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

[Report from Hangzhou, this newspaper, 2nd] According to the research of geological experts, the coal in Changxing coal mine belongs to the Longtan coal series of the Permian period. Because its dip runs east-west at an angle of 50 degrees, some people mistakenly believe that there are two layers of coal, but in fact, there is only one layer. This coal has a high sulfur content, which in chemical formula is S+O2=SO2, SO2+HO2=H2SO3, meaning there is a high content of sulfurous acid. A high content of sulfurous acid is corrosive to steel, so in principle, the industry does not welcome it very much. However, because Changxing is located in a water town, transportation by boat can reduce costs considerably. Therefore, before the war, power plants in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places were happy to use Changxing coal, so Changxing coal has its natural value.

According to the county government's estimates, the Changxing coal mine area covers 1,651 hectares, or 4,005 acres, with reserves estimated by the coal mine company at 17 million tons. As far back as 100 years ago, many local people used primitive methods to mine it. Later, Liu Wanqing took over, and he reorganized it and used some new methods. Work stopped in 1927. Then, the Central Construction Commission took over, followed by the Ningyi Banking Group in 1932. In 1937, the Central Construction Commission took it back. This period was the most developed period. Mining was done by machine, and the mining area had its own power plant. Employees had complete dormitories and all the social facilities needed, such as medical care. A 27-kilometer light railway ran from the mining area all the way to the wharf where the coal was unloaded. At that time, the county government estimated that 30,000 tons of coal could be produced per month. However, the good times did not last long. Later, merchants fought with the central government to get it back. The War of Resistance against Japan broke out, and work stopped. Work resumed later, but in August of 1940, we destroyed it. At that time, Commissioner Yu Shu rushed to the scene and planned to move the machinery away, but the garrison refused, so it was all blown up.

After the victory of the War of Resistance, according to local people, some of the light railway remained on the roadbed. Later, some people stole it, and others moved it away. Now, the coal mine has nothing left except for some dilapidated and crumbling houses.

The Resources Committee intends to restore this coal mine, so in October 1948, the Executive Yuan approved the establishment of the Changxing Coal Mine Company and appointed someone to be responsible for surveying the site. According to the research results of experts, if the old wells are to be restored, then because the old wells are almost completely destroyed, they must be reorganized first and then excavated, so it will take more work. According to the value of the gold yuan in August 1948, it will cost 8 million yuan, and it will take 18 months to reach the coal seam, and 400 tons can be produced per day. If a new well is opened, then Baocun can be tentatively selected, which is slightly more convenient than the old well project. According to the value of the gold yuan in August 1948, it will cost 4 million yuan. Later, the Resources Committee selected the latter, and immediately allocated funds and transported machinery to urgently seek restoration. In December of that year, the Changxing Coal Mine Company established an office in Wuxing, and in January 1949, it went to Changxing to work on the ground. In order to understand the excavation project of this only large mine in Jiangnan, the reporter went to Changxing and then to the mining area in late March. The road we traveled was the base of the former light railway. Although the roadbed was solid, the road surface was not paved, so the car was very bumpy. In the car, County Chief Cheng Yiting told me that the Lijiaxiang area in the county is an area with numerous stone mines. The stone blocks are sold to Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places every year in large quantities, and the quarrying and lime burning are also quite developed. When we passed Hexi, we saw a jar kiln in the distance, which specializes in burning porcelain jars. When we passed Baixian, we saw paper troughs and brick and tile industries. I deeply felt that Changxing is a small handicraft area.

After an hour's drive, we arrived at Dameishan in the mining area, which is

the location of the old well. Many local people are picking coal slag from the coal pits dug out of the old well. It is said that this kind of coal slag can be sold to iron shops in Yixing and other places for ironworking. Each person can also earn one or two dan of rice per month for their hard work. They have been living on this for three years. In addition, many dilapidated former coal mine worker dormitories are inhabited by poor local residents. Not a single tile remains of the power plant. A large chimney still stands perfectly intact on the flat ground. The old well cannot be found either. Only a few station doors for transporting coal to small trains are blocked by garbage and coal slag.

We then moved forward to Baocun, where a road is being built to connect to Dameishan. After walking about two kilometers, we arrived at

the location of the new well. The new well has not yet been excavated, and only one or two zhang of mud have been dug out. A wooden post is nailed to the soil, marking the place where the new well will be opened. According to an engineer, "Not far from here, the 'lutou' - that is, the ore vein - has been discovered. Two wells are planned to be dug. Well No. 1 is six feet wide and nine feet long and is used for digging coal; Well No. 2 is four feet wide and six feet long and is used for ventilation and other equipment. Each well is dug to a depth of 120 feet. Coal can be seen at 70 feet, but we are afraid that the coal at 70 feet has been 'eaten' - that is, has been dug. Therefore, we do not excavate at the coal seam at 70 feet, but continue to dig deeper, until the coal comes out at 120 feet." Now

what they are looking forward to is the construction of the road and the transportation of the machinery. As long as the road is built and the machinery is transported, they can start drilling the wells. According to another engineer, the estimated progress of the well-drilling project is about one foot per day, so coal can be produced in four months. When the coal is first produced, about 150 tons can be produced per day.

The employees of the new Changxing Coal Mine Company are now living in private homes and have not used the original employee dormitories. Their lives are very difficult. Their only hope is to be able to produce coal. Once the coal is produced, the company can also survive.

I asked a few old people who were picking coal scraps, and they had

a strong hope for the future coal production. They hope that the coal will be produced as soon as possible so that they can also rely on it for a living. Therefore, they are very supportive of the Changxing Coal Mine Company. They know that helping the coal mine company is helping themselves. On the back of the mountain across from them, I heard that the communists are also digging coal mines. After a lot of time, they have not been successful and have now stopped work.

Judging from Changxing's reserves and coal quality, we feel that Changxing coal does not seem suitable for steelmaking. Of course, it cannot seek a way out in heavy industry. Changxing coal can only play a role in regulating fuel in the surrounding area, and can only seek subsidies in some light and small industries. We hope that it can play a role in industries that support agriculture.

### Powerful Longtou Still No Match for Qingbai

[This newspaper] The match between Qingbai and Longtou in the second round of the Group A Football League should be one of the most exciting matches because, apart from the Railway team, there is really no other team that can compete. Qingbai is the leader of Group A, and Longtou is the representative of the Northern School. Although Longtou suffered a crushing defeat of 1-5 in the first round, Qingbai now lacks Qu Yongfu and Fei Chun, and defender Yan Shixi is resting. With these circumstances, the reunion of the two teams will definitely be a tense and exciting performance. As a result, Qingbai is still the leader of the heroes. Although Longtou tried its best to knock them down, Qingbai won easily by a score of 3-1. In the first half, Qingbai scored two goals first.

In the 90-minute match, Longtou controlled most of the offensive time, and the ball went back and forth on Qingbai's field. As a result, Qingbai won. Qingbai can be said to be good at both offense and defense. The defense was playing with a third defender. Meng Yiliang, Qian Changrong, and Jiang Yunqing stood side by side in front of the goal, watching. Huang Renjie was in charge of the goal, repelling all of Longtou's attacks. Although the ball was circling in front of Qingbai's goal, it always stopped at the door. Meng Yiliang was still calm as an old general, calmly hitting the ball back. Although he was fat, he could still run. Except for Qian Changrong's slightly weak performance, the performance was satisfactory. In the fourth quarter of the second half, Qingbai was sure of victory and won three straight goals. Fu Naitang and Zhang Fenggang were replaced by Jin Lusheng and Qian Changrong, and Meng Yiliang was careless and went out far, and it was too late to run back. Longtou regained a goal, breaking the duck egg, which was Qingbai's complacency and carelessness. As for the forwards lined up in a W formation, Luo Shoufu always slipped behind. As soon as the opportunity came, he immediately rushed straight, catching Longtou off guard. Longtou tried to watch him, but it was not successful. Liu Longxin's center forward ran very fast and has a great future. Although the forwards are all young players, their coordination skills are superior, with many short passes and tricks under their feet, and they run fast, which is far beyond the reach of Longtou's Northern School style.

Longtou's strengths are hard feet and strong strength, but they cannot connect, which is a major problem. Charging straight ahead is useless. When the forwards arrive in front of the goal, they are finished. The shots are either too soft or go sideways, and many good opportunities are lost. Longtou kicked off and attacked first, with great momentum. The offensive was extremely fierce. Jiang Kun and Zhang Jingen echoed each other on the left wing to attack. A pass in the middle was not received. Qingbai counterattacked. Only Xiao Luo Jin Lusheng was seen rushing forward on the left, but it was also ineffective. Within five minutes, Longtou's army pressed the border, and the momentum was extremely fierce. At this time, Qingbai rushed to send the ball. Yuan Yisa intercepted and rushed fiercely. Longtou was caught off guard, and the ball flew to the left wing. Only Jin Lusheng was seen flying away, rushing straight to the front of the dragon gate, kicking towards the middle, Liu Long caught up tightly, and a shot opened the record. Longtou suffered a blow within five minutes, and its vigor did not decrease. Two corner kicks were taken in a row, but no one responded in the middle. After that, although Longtou attacked fiercely, only high balls went back and forth, which did not help. Until the 25th minute, Xiao Gu broke through the gap, and Xiao Luo got the ball and rushed straight again. Seeing the fierce attack, Zheng Bingyi stepped forward and shoveled it, and was fined a penalty kick. Meng Yiliang scored a goal. Longtou suffered another blow, and the future became more bleak. Although the offensive did not stop, it was of no avail. The first half was two to zero.

In the second half, Qingbai did not move its original lineup, and Longtou replaced Wang Burong and Melson with new players Xia Shiyin and Wu Houcheng. The ball was still in Longtou's hands. Only Qingbai's door was seen, and a large army was flying. Chen Qin and Xia Shiyin had two very good opportunities on the left wing, but they failed to create them. Wang Baoshan took a shot from afar, and it also fell into the hands of Huang Shijie. An hour later, Huang Renyi sent the ball, another breakthrough. Liu Tiyin echoed on the right wing. The ball went from left to right. Liu Tiyin waited for it, and a diagonal shot went into the net. Qingbai won three straight. So Xu Wenkui saw that the victory or defeat was determined, and transferred Qian Changrong and Jin Lusheng. Qingbai took the opportunity to launch a large-scale attack. Yao Qingsheng got the ball and rushed straight. Meng Yiliang could not catch up. Jiang Kun and Xia Shiyin advanced side by side. Seeing the critical situation, Huang Shijie rushed out to save the day and fell to the ground when he collided. The ball was shot by Jiang Kun and bounced into Huang Shijie's body, and Longtou regained a goal, and everyone was happy. From then on, Qingbai hurried to collect the troops, and Meng Yiliang retreated to defend, ending the game.

### Hualian Narrowly Escapes a Tragedy Shanghai Police Wins First, Loses Later

[This newspaper] The basketball league match between Shanghai Police and Hualian last night was eagerly watched by the audience. As a result, Hualian defeated Shanghai Police by a score of 46 to 40, winning by six points. In the first half, Shanghai Police led by two points with a score of 21 to 23. The battle situation was very tense.

Hualian's main player, Li Zhenzhong, did not appear on the field, which was originally a good opportunity for the Shanghai Police. In the first half, the Shanghai Police had a tight defense, and Shi Jiuquan was also exceptionally sharp, so Hualian fell behind by two points. In the second half, Hualian began to show its normal state. The young player Le Jiazhou is admirable, and yesterday's performance of Song Yuanyuan was also not bad.

In the women's team, the Green Team defeated Xinghua, 44 to 16. In the friendly match, Huili defeated Haiqing, 72 to 16. The battle situation of the three matches is as follows:

First, let's talk about the final battle between Hualian and Shanghai Police, which attracted 3,000 spectators. The starting lineups for Hualian were Liu Fushan, Bao Songyuan, Wu Chengzhang, Le Jiazhou, and Chuan Jinsheng, and the Shanghai Police countered with Wang Bowen, Wang Rongsheng, Shi Jiuquan, He Zeng, and Chuan Qixia. After the start of the game, Jiazhou and Bowen each scored a goal, and the Shanghai Police called a timeout. Le scored on a penalty kick. With the efforts of Jiuquan, Bowen, and Rongsheng, the Shanghai Police exceeded by 10 to 5. Hualian stared in shock and called a timeout. Chengzhang brought the ball in, and Bowen's corner kick was unsuccessful. Jiuquan then shot the ball into the basket again. The Shanghai Police was invincible. Bao Songyuan's usual sharpshooting also showed signs of failing. At 15 minutes, the score was 19 to 10. Hualian remarried the strategy. Songyuan and Jiazhou scored five points in one go, 21 to 15. Yongbiao transferred Qixia, and Xiaole was quite smooth, adding two more goals in a row. In the first half, the Shanghai Police led with 23, and Hualian had 21, with a difference of only one goal.

In the second half, He Jingui replaced Yongbiao. Fushan wasted a shot, Chengzhang scored, and Jiazhou scored on a penalty kick. Hualian turned over with a score of 24 to 23. Rongsheng and Lao Bao each showed their skills, and everyone fought with a one-point difference. Chengzhang shot from a long distance again, and Hualian led by three points. At 32 to 28, the Shanghai Police missed the basket several times. At this time, Qixia replaced Jingui, and Hualian temporarily stopped with 37 to 32. Bao, Wu, and Le continued to develop, reaching 45 to 37. Chuan Qixia committed five fouls, and Jingui played instead. With three minutes remaining, Yongbiao replaced Bowen. The Shanghai Police still had the hope of "fighting to the death." Er Rongsheng followed in Qixia's footsteps. Bowen became a Feng Fu again, but time was running out. Hualian finally defeated Shanghai Police by a score of 46 to 40.

### Green Team Wins Every Game Xinghua Fights Hard But Loses

The women's team Green Team played against Xinghua. The Green Team's "Little Shandong" Shi Zonglan turned over and scored a goal, and Huang Mingyuan scored on a penalty kick, reaching three points at once. Xinghua's Wang Shan scored a basket, but the golden chicken heart on her chest jumped out at the same time. Mingyuan's continuous scoring resulted in the Green Team winning 9 to 2 in the first quarter. In the second quarter, Xinghua fought hard and scored seven points, while the Green Team only scored six points. In the first half, the Green Team led with 15 to 9.

In the third quarter, at 25 to 11, Xinghua's guard Wu Zhaorui committed five fouls and was "full." Because there were no substitutes, Wang Zhelun was transferred to the rear to take charge. Although there were only Qian Mengyue and Wang Shan left in front, this quarter was still able to tie the score, with everyone getting six points (31 to 15). The Green Team seemed to be "regressing." At the end of the fourth quarter, the score was 44 to 16, and Xinghua was defeated.

### Friendly Match Huili Wins Haiqing

In the friendly match between Huili and Haiqing, the players who appeared on the field for Huili were Zeng Zhiji, Tian Fuhai, Wei Yu, Ye Yunshan, and Chen Zhengmiao. After the start of the game, Chen scored first, and Li Bo returned a goal. Sinuo continued, and Chen scored again, making the score 4 each. The main player Wang Yongfang's "fragrant trail" was not seen, and Huili was inevitably dimmed. Li Bo added another goal, and Huili intensified its attack. At 8 to 6, Xu Shuyuan replaced Zhiji, and Haiqing replaced three players. At 14 to 6, Huili Bai Baokang, Luo Dinghou, and the Shang brothers went in. Haiqing was also changing like a revolving lantern. In the first half, the score was 31 to 7, and Huili exerted its strength.

In the second half, Huili increased by ten points as soon as it touched the ball. Haiqing's score was still sparse. As a result, Huili won a big victory with a score of 72 to 16. The captain of the Haiqing team said: They had only practiced for two weeks and could not have a good performance, and expressed their apologies.

### Things to Know About Table Tennis

— Written by Wang Xin Jing, Edited by Chen Lin Sheng (5)

(3) Habits and Posture

I remember a person who had a low spot in his study. He always felt inconvenienced when he went there. But after some time, he got used to it. Later, his family saw the situation in his study and had someone fill it in. But he felt very unnatural because he was used to the low spot. This shows how deeply rooted habits are in people and how difficult they are to change once they have formed. Beginners in table tennis should pay attention to developing good habits.

We often see some people, when hitting the ball, touching the racket after each hit; some lightly tap the racket on the table after each hit; some touch the table with the hand that is not holding the racket; some sigh loudly and exhale after missing a shot; some constantly hiss, and some stomp their feet forcefully... These situations, when written on paper, may not seem strange, but they are inevitably awkward during a match.

As for incorrect posture, one should also pay attention: some people, when serving, first bend their knees several times before slowly swinging their arms; some focus intensely on the ball with their facial muscles extremely tense, staring at the opponent, and then, after their mouth twitches to the left, they smash the ball; even some mutter words to themselves before serving... Such postures are also inevitably awkward.

Unfavorable habits and incorrect postures not only detract from aesthetics but are also often uneconomical in terms of physical strength and make movements stiff. Therefore, when learning, one should pay attention to natural posture and develop good habits.

(4) Power and Accuracy in Playing Table Tennis

Playing table tennis involves variations in "power," with differences in the lightness and heaviness of the shots, and differences in distance. Furthermore, the shots must be "accurate," able to go high or low, left or right, perfectly suited to one's ideal target. To achieve this "power" and "accuracy," those involved in table tennis should have a thorough understanding of the methods and theories.

The power behind playing table tennis can be divided into two types: one is the original power, which is muscle strength; the other is kinetic energy. Kinetic energy mainly comes from the swinging speed of the arm, with the reactive force generated by the ball's potential energy as a secondary factor. When these two types of "power," "muscle strength" and "kinetic energy," are used together when hitting, the resulting "power" is greater; when used separately, the resulting "power" is smaller.

Muscle strength is generated under the control of the brain, which is the "power" that comes naturally. Reactive force is generated when the momentum of the ball encounters resistance. The source of this reactive force is fixed and cannot be cultivated through methods.

### Commentary on the Blue Dragon Battle

Yesterday afternoon at half past three, a tense and exciting scene unfolded at Yiyuan Stadium. The Northern Bear (Longtou Team) faced the Eastern Tiger (Qingbai Team). Both sides possessed strong capabilities and were unfortunately eliminated in the Mayor's Cup. Meeting in yesterday's battle, they both gave their all to regain their reputation, resulting in a lively and impressive match. Longtou's style was firm and bold, with vigorous strokes and agile footwork, effectively controlling the midfield. Qingbai, on the other hand, was more resilient, with a solid defense and rapid forward advances, skillful shooting, and better cooperation, ultimately forcing Longtou to surrender. Objectively speaking, although Longtou's play was refreshing and pleasing to the eye, their forwards lacked shooting skills. While they were very active in the midfield, they hesitated and missed opportunities when approaching the opponent's penalty area. In the defense, the center-backs only knew how to intercept the ball and send it high, lacking teamwork and cover. Qingbai's superior strategy naturally led to a greater chance of victory. In the first round-robin, they had defeated Longtou 5-1, but at that time, Yan Shixin, Qu Yongfu, and Fei Chunhua were all on the team. Now, Shixin is weary, Afu is missing, and Xiaofei has joined Huamian. With the departure of the Three Musketeers, their strength has been greatly affected. Although Qian Changrong and Liu Longxin have returned to the team, it is ultimately not enough to compensate for the loss. They should be wary when facing the Railway team in the future, as the Railway team recently won the Mayor's Cup and is full of momentum. In the league, they have only lost once to Qingbai, closely following behind. If they can defeat Qingbai in the second round-robin, Qingbai's leading position may be shaken, so they must be cautious.

In yesterday's match, Qingbai's defense was still centered around Meng Yiliang, a pillar of strength who worked tirelessly. Sanmao's inside backs had clear footwork and effective cover, compensating for eighty percent of Wu Qixiang's performance. Qian Changrong, reassigned to the inside back position, was also remarkable. Xue Peiran switched between forward and back, Zhang Renyi intercepted the ball aggressively both in front and behind, and Liu Longxin's center forward often pushed forward, forming the spearhead of the attack. Luo and Gu, the two inside forwards, served as the blood vessels of the attack, and Jin Lusheng's wing greatly threatened Longtou. Liu Tiyin's crosses and corner kicks were worthy of a winger. After Xiaofei left, Liu was reassigned to the wing, which may be a way for him to stand out.

Although Longtou fought bravely throughout the match, Qingbai maintained the advantage. However, in the second half, the personnel changes destabilized their footing and shook their morale. Furthermore, Sanmao playing the left inside back position caused a chain reaction, allowing Longtou to seize this opportunity to launch a major counterattack and score a goal. This shows the importance of personnel deployment. A slight carelessness can easily lead to mistakes that are difficult to remedy. Fortunately, the changes were made late in the game, otherwise, the outcome would have been difficult to predict.

Longtou's Zheng Bingyi played dangerously and was warned by the referee. I always feel that Longtou's style of play can easily cause harm to both themselves and others, so it is better to be cautious. Shi Dafa's performance was not weak, desperately containing Xiao Luo and effectively shutting down Qingbai's left-wing attack, which was quite successful. The newcomer Wu Houcheng was okay, but Xia Shiyin still lacked experience. His ability to break through was very fast, but Zhang Jingen's left wing had a weakness: a "dead left foot." He had several opportunities, and if Zhang could have shot with his right foot, it would have been easier to achieve results. However, because his right foot was unusable, he missed many good opportunities, which was a pity. Chen Qin had a performance above standard, and Jiang Kun also worked hard. The team's style is bold and unrestrained, but the defense has loopholes due to this boldness, and the forwards lack shooting skills, failing to capitalize on their strengths. The boldness, in fact, became detrimental. (By the Ball History Public)

### Who Has Thought About Children?

— Li Jie

Every Children's Day, there is always a set of Children's Day routines led by adults, such as commemorative meetings, concerts, or calligraphy competitions. For twenty years, it has never changed, as if this is how Children's Day is "celebrated." In fact, Children's Day is definitely not for us to "celebrate," but an opportunity for us to reflect: what can we do for the next generation? Commemorative meetings are absolutely unnecessary. Adults put on solemn faces to lecture, making a large group of pitiful elementary school students listen to your nonsense on an empty stomach. Is this the way to "celebrate"? As for concerts or competitions, although they are also a kind of encouragement for some children, they are just a little embellishment for talented or lucky children, which can be there or not. The important thing, I think, is to sit down and think about what problems the next generation has that need to be solved now. Children's Day is not a day for celebration, but a day for deep thought for adults.

As everyone knows, the most important problems facing children today are two: education and health. The so-called "national primary school," is it still a primary school that "national" can attend today? It has simply become a school that only families above the middle class can afford to send their children to. And the so-called families above the middle class, of course, do not refer to the petty civil servants, because civil servants are already mostly impoverished. These people are law-abiding and thrifty intellectuals. Their children have inherited their upright and frugal character due to heredity, family education, and the environment. If education excludes this group of excellent next generation and only adds icing on the cake for the sons and daughters of corrupt officials and bad gentry, imagine how terrible the next generation's society will become if led by these people.

Secondly, there is the issue of health. This is even more important than education. If we look at the complexions of most children, they are mostly sallow; in terms of mood, they are naturally silent and listless. This is due to nutrition and family economic environment, and it is extremely difficult to improve unless there is a complete change in the social organization. But in terms of disease prevention and treatment afterward, we have not done anything at all. Some large hospitals named public hospitals have such intimidating consultation fees that parents are deterred. Municipal hospitals are cheaper, but the small number of doctors and the large number of patients often make a sick child sit outside for three or four hours waiting to be called. The municipal health authorities should at least strictly prohibit the high pediatric consultation fees of many hospitals and establish and equip medical facilities specifically for children as much as possible, universally implementing work from disease prevention to treatment for children.

The most ridiculous thing is the collection of admission tickets at municipal parks such as Zhongshan, Zhongzheng, Fuxing, and the Bund. Although very young children do not need tickets, the mothers who take them in must have tickets, and the tickets are constantly being adjusted. I don't understand why the municipal government is so poor that it has to scrape a little pitiful money from this. Parks are for children, so at least it should be stipulated that mothers with children are not charged admission tickets. This is certainly a small matter, but it also shows how seriously we take the needs and welfare of children!

### Children's Music

— You Ting

In times of war, art is most easily overlooked; when parents' income is not even enough to feed themselves, "children's music" is most easily dismissed.

However, no matter how difficult the country is, our nation cannot be without culture and art! Painting, architecture, drama, etc., may be able to wait until the world is peaceful before making a comeback, but only music cannot wait for a long time; because the learning of music is limited by age. Successful musicians in the world all started learning at the age of four or five. There has never been a musician who started studying after the age of ten and was able to succeed. And the examples of children who started composing and performing publicly at the age of seven or nine are extremely common facts in the biographies of ancient and modern musicians.

Among the few musicians in China, such as the violin virtuoso Ma Si-hong in the United States, the pianist Huang Guangguang, and the late Pan Meibo, their achievements are due to the opportunity to learn from a young age, in addition to talent; on the contrary, many music students who only entered music schools after graduating from high school and started from scratch have the same unfortunate result: a waste of time and energy. Take Mr. Xian Xinghai (deceased), for example. His talent cannot be said to be low, and his spirit of hard work and dedication is especially admirable, but he started too late and ultimately failed to achieve his wish. When he arrived in Paris with great difficulty, using the money he earned from hard work as tuition, he was already about twenty years old when he began studying the violin at the Paris Conservatory. Abundant talent and strong interest could not help him.

Musical talent is innate. When children take "music tests," as long as they have ears that are sensitive to sound, they can recognize the subtle differences in pitch without prior training, and they have the potential to achieve something in music, but the only condition is that they must start learning from a young age.

China is a country with all kinds of geniuses, but due to various reasons (economic and traditional concepts), we not only do not discover geniuses, but also constantly destroy them. Countless talented children are forced to learn things they do not like to learn. By the time the child grows up and has the ability to study music on their own, it is too late. How cruel this is for them personally, and how serious it is for the national culture!

On the occasion of Children's Day and the music competition held by the Music and Education Association, I wrote this ordinary opinion, hoping that this competition can change parents' traditional concepts and not arbitrarily bury their children's talents; especially hoping that those in power will accept our soft and weak loyal words while dealing with national affairs: no matter what, our nation cannot be without art!

### The Story of the Pig Juice Injection

——A Fairy Tale for Adults

Once upon a time, there was a country in the East called Meat-Eating Country. The people there loved to eat meat very much, and they had to eat a little with every meal, otherwise they couldn't swallow the rice. Besides eating meat, they also loved to fight wars. They fought with foreigners and with their own people. After fighting for more than ten years, they became completely impoverished. They originally used "paper coupons" as currency, then changed to "gold coupons"; in the end, they had to change to "diamond coupons," each coupon said to be worth 1.734586 carats—but they couldn't really be exchanged for diamonds. Even so, prices were still soaring every day, especially the meat that everyone had to eat, which cost 10,000 diamond coupons per catty, that is, 10,000 to 10,000+ carats. At first, everyone ate pork and beef, but gradually, even rat meat sold for 5,000 per catty. But they still had to eat it.

The authorities in Meat-Eating Country were at a loss, so they invited a large number of experts from abroad to study the countermeasures. The experts really came, more than two hundred in total. While eating rat meat, they carefully investigated and researched, and finally came up with a solution.

First, they researched that the reason why pork is so delicious is because it contains a kind of "pig juice element"; this pig juice element can be extracted and injected into other animals once a month. After a year, although the animal's appearance will not change, the taste of its meat will be the same as pork.

Secondly, the experts found that there were no animals left in Meat-Eating Country for the pig juice injection. Because of years of consumption, even dog meat had been eaten up, leaving only rats. And rats are too small. Even if they are injected with pig juice, they will not sell for much money by the catty.

Finally, the experts found a solution. They saw the report from the Pushen Mountain Villa in a certain big city in Meat-Eating Country, saying that the corpses collected last winter were about 90 percent children's corpses. According to the report, almost all the female beggars who slept on the streets at night had one or two children who were sallow and emaciated and would die sooner or later. Even the children of good families, although there were many, were also skinny and unable to grow up.

The experts then submitted a report to the Meat-Eating Country government, saying: Since there are so many children in your country, and the poorer the families, the more children they have, and eight or nine out of ten of these children will eventually be buried by Pushen Mountain Villa and will not be able to survive; then why not turn uselessness into usefulness, turn consumption into production, that is: inject them with pig juice, and sell them to slaughterhouses when the time is right. On the one hand, this can solve the meat shortage, and on the other hand, it can allow poor and civil servant parents to have some income. Wouldn't that kill two birds with one stone?

The Meat-Eating Country government immediately adopted this perfect suggestion and ordered its implementation nationwide. In order to increase the meat supply, they set up an agency to manufacture thousands of pig juice injections and distributed them to civil servants as part of their in-kind benefits, so that their children could be injected.

Everyone was very happy. In the homes of civil servants with many children, except for one left to carry on the family line, most of the others were injected with pig juice. From then on, these children injected with pig juice became the family's source of income, and the parents were especially happy with them, giving them nutritious things to eat so that they would be fatter, heavier, and sell for more money.

However, the name "pig" is always very unpleasant. Therefore, they referred to boys or girls who had been injected with pig juice as "Big-Eared Brothers" or "Big-Eared Sisters." When we go to people's houses, we can often hear such conversations:

"How many Big-Eared Brothers do you have? How many catties is the biggest one?"

"We only have two. Your Big-Eared Sister looks like she's more than fifty catties!"

From then on, most of the children in Meat-Eating Country were injected with pig juice and were greatly protected by the government and loved by their parents. And the meat shortage was naturally resolved. In order to commemorate the invention of this foreign expert that enriched the country and benefited the people, they designated the day when the government published the pig juice injection report as "Children's Day"—which is April 4th.
