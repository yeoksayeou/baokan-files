[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Military authorities issued a war bulletin at 9:30 PM on the 4th: (1) The situation in Kunshan and Taicang remains unchanged. The local communists who briefly caused disturbances in Liuhe yesterday have been completely eliminated by our forces. (2) Since our army proactively abandoned Hangzhou, only a small number of local communists have infiltrated the suburbs to carry out activities. The main force of the communist army has not yet arrived. (3) The railroad bridges between Hangzhou and Jiaxing have been thoroughly destroyed by us, making it extremely difficult for the communist heavy weapons to pass through. Train service on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway can reach Jiaxing directly. Jiaxing and Pingwang are still firmly defended by a unit of our army, with heavy troops stationed along the line. If the communists invade, they will be severely attacked. (4) On the afternoon of the 3rd, three regiments of communist troops with an unknown designation, accompanied by over a hundred carts, advanced eastward from Nanxun towards Zhenze. (5) Over three thousand communist troops, divided into groups, infiltrated Chun'an, Suian, Yuqian and other places on the evening of the 3rd. Telegraph communications with these areas have now been severed. (6) After the communist invasion and capture of Wuxi and Suzhou, in addition to leaving a small number of troops in each county to establish military control commissions, the majority of their main force marched south along the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. The communist troops along the railway line are now moving back and forth daily, creating confusion. They have also ordered residents to report their grain reserves within a limited time and levied 40% of it. Those who do not comply will have their property confiscated and severely punished. Residents fear them like snakes and scorpions and have established anti-communist committees.

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Military authorities announced at 10:00 AM on the 4th: (1) Due to strategic considerations, Hangzhou no longer has any value for defense.

### Zhang Zhizhong Detained in Beiping; Guo Jiyao Appointed Acting Northwest Military and Political Governor; Executive Yuan Resolved in Yesterday's Meeting

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou Dispatch, 4th] General Zhang Zhizhong, Northwest Military and Political Governor, has been detained in Beiping by the Communist Party, preventing him from returning to his post in the Northwest to perform his duties. The Executive Yuan resolved in yesterday’s meeting to remove Zhang from his position and appoint Deputy Governor Guo Jiyao as acting governor. It is reported that after arriving in Beiping on April 1st as the chief representative of the government’s peace negotiation delegation, Zhang devoted himself day and night to discussions with the communist side in a spirit of bearing humiliation and responsibility, hoping to achieve a reasonable and just lasting peace. It was originally hoped that the Communist Party would recognize its past mistakes, be open and honest, and work together to achieve true peace, to relieve the people from suffering and prevent the country from falling into a state of irrecoverable ruin. However, after three weeks of negotiations, the Communist Party not only showed no sincerity but responded to the government’s request for a temporary ceasefire agreement with a general offensive order. Thereafter, the Communist Party simultaneously launched a large-scale crossing of the Yangtze River and detained the entire government peace negotiation delegation, revealing their despicable conspiracy. In light of this, the government recently revoked the name of the government peace negotiation delegation, and yesterday also removed Zhang from his position as Northwest Military and Political Governor. Since Zhang is detained in Beiping and unable to perform his duties, and the important military and political matters of the Northwest cannot be without someone in charge for a single day, the government had no choice but to take this necessary measure.

### Resolutions of the Executive Yuan

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou Dispatch, 4th] The Executive Yuan held its 58th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 4th. President He presided over the meeting.

### Yangtze River Fleet Safely Withdraws to Engage in New Combat Missions; Xing'an and Weihai Ships Destroyed

Spokesman for Naval Headquarters Speaks

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] According to the spokesman for the Naval Headquarters, the Navy's Yangtze River Fleet has been defending the Yangtze River in coordination with friendly forces for three months. Thanks to the brave struggle of the officers and soldiers, despite the difficult and treacherous environment of fighting with their backs to the river on a 500-mile front, they were still able to accomplish the expected tasks. Since Nanjing's strategic retreat, the defensive value of the Yangtze River has been lost. In order to adapt to new strategic needs, the Navy withdrew the Yangtze River Fleet. All the ships in the fleet, except for the Xing'an and Weihai, which were severely damaged and ran aground near Jiangyin due to rudder damage, making them impossible to sail out and thus seized by the communists, the remaining thirteen ships, including the Yongjia, have all safely withdrawn to the expected area. The Yongding and Yongxiu, which were operating around Anqing, and the Yixian and Xinyang, which were threatened by the enemy who had betrayed the Jiangyin Fortress and were blockading the area, have also been safely withdrawn. They are now engaging in another combat mission in the new strategic area. In order to ensure water safety, the Navy has dispatched aircraft to completely destroy the above-mentioned two ships seized by the communists.

### Improved Treatment for Civil Servants and Teachers to be Implemented This Month; Calculated in Customs Gold Units and Adjusted and Issued in Gold Yuan at a Guaranteed Rate

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou Dispatch, 4th] In view of the recent soaring prices and the extremely difficult living conditions of civil and military public servants, the government decided at the 58th meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 4th that the treatment of civil and military public servants would be calculated in Customs Gold Units (關元) and issued in Gold Yuan at a guaranteed rate, starting in May.

### Hong Kong Overcrowded; Ship and Air Tickets to Leave Hong Kong Sold Out for Four to Five Months; British and American Consulates in South China Advise Guangdong and Guangxi Overseas Chinese to Return Home

[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong Dispatch, 3rd] If the number of evacuees entering Hong Kong continues unabated, the situation here will become extremely serious, as there is a severe shortage of ships leaving Hong Kong. Ship and air tickets leaving Hong Kong have been sold out for four to five months. British and American consuls in South China are now advising their respective nationals to evacuate from Guangdong and Guangxi provinces and "return directly to their home countries," but these evacuees will inevitably gather in Hong Kong, waiting for ships and airplanes. The Dutch mail ship Boissevain, which arrived here on Monday, carried 800 evacuees from Shanghai, including 55 British nationals, none of whom have obtained accommodation. More ships will arrive in the coming days, and hotels and other accommodations are overcrowded. Evacuees are currently living in seamen's dormitories and refugee shelters.

[United Press, Guangzhou Dispatch, 4th] Although American and British nationals have received evacuation advice from their consulates, most are still taking a wait-and-see approach, believing that there is no immediate threat to Guangzhou.

[Associated Press, Guangzhou Dispatch, 3rd] U.S. consulate officials said on the 3rd that there are no plans to use U.S. warships to evacuate American nationals from South China.

They added that commercial transportation between Guangzhou and Hong Kong is sufficient to allow a large number of nationals to evacuate in an emergency. They also said that American airplanes and ships are available.

[United Press, San Francisco Dispatch, 3rd] Pan American Airlines announced today that the crowding of foreign nationals evacuating from Shanghai has eased. According to a radio report from the Shanghai management office, there is no need to add special flights. The three special flights originally scheduled to fly to Hong Kong this week have been canceled.

### Attlee to Make Statement on China Situation in the House of Commons Today; Bevin Consulting with U.S. State Department on Communist China Issue

[Reuters, London Dispatch, 3rd] When Prime Minister Attlee makes a statement on the situation in China in the House of Commons this Thursday, he is expected to mention the status of Hong Kong. Conservative Member of Parliament Gammons asked what measures the government has taken to protect Hong Kong from foreign aggression or the activities of internal fifth columnists. Deputy Prime Minister Morrison replied that Prime Minister Attlee's statement on Thursday will definitely involve the status of Hong Kong.

[Central News Agency, London Dispatch, 3rd] According to a exclusive report in the "Daily Telegraph" on the 3rd, British Foreign Secretary Bevin is currently consulting with the U.S. State Department on the progress of the Communist Party in China to compare the views of the two countries.

He solemnly denied the possibility that the British government has considered or recognized the Chinese Communist regime. The spokesman admitted that British consular officials in the Communist-controlled areas have been ordered to contact the Communist authorities to protect the lives and property of British nationals, but stated that this action is by no means the same as recognizing the Communist regime or establishing diplomatic relations with it. Asked whether British consuls in the Communist areas, especially the British consuls in Beiping and Nanjing, have obtained contact with the Communist Party, the spokesman replied "not yet".

### In Order to Prevent a Tragic Situation in the Pacific, Military and Economic Aid to China Must Be Stepped Up: Chennault Urgently Appeals Before the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee

[United Press, Washington, 3rd] Major General Chennault predicted on the 3rd that if the Communists are not contained in China, both Japan and the Philippines will be Red.

Chennault testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, scoffing at the supposed defensive value of the "island chain" off the Asian coast, and predicted that the Soviet Union would have a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere from the Bering Strait to Bali. Mr. Chen then asked, "In such circumstances, what will be the situation of Pearl Harbor, Midway Island, Guam, Wake Island, New Zealand, Australia, the Philippines, and the smaller islands in the Pacific? It is simply foolish for us to think that we can defend the Pacific from this side of the Pacific."

Republican Senator Knowland then spoke in the Senate, asking all senators to read Chennault's testimony.

Chennault reiterated that the only way to prevent a tragic situation is to provide military and economic aid to China. Mr. Chen then described how fragile the defense forces of Southeast Asia are, and then stated that the assassination of Mrs. Quezon and her daughter a few days ago, less than a hundred miles from Manila, proved that the Communist-led peasant army is still seriously disrupting the Philippines.

The United States Should Act Quickly

Mr. Chen continued that unless the United States acts quickly, the Chinese Communists will reach the borders of Vietnam, where Ho Chi Minh, trained by Moscow, has established his Communist regime. It is expected that Ho Chi Minh will receive assistance from China, and his power will expand to the rest of Vietnam. Thereafter, Siam will be surrounded on two sides, and the fall of that country will open the gateway to Malaya. Then Burma and the Indonesian archipelago will also fall one after another. The Communist occupation of Southeast Asia will place severe pressure on India and encourage the Soviet Union to advance again into the urgent Middle East. It is an optimistic fantasy to think that if all of Asia is in Communist hands, Japan and the Philippines will still peacefully remain on the American side, unless the United States adopts a "cruel imperialist" policy and makes Japan a colony, otherwise the Japanese will become vassals of Asia under Communist rule and there is no other way to go. "Therefore, I foresee that at the end of the easy path we are currently taking, there will be a "Communist Japan."

Chennault suggested that the United States provide assistance, followed by U.S. supervision, saying, "Mr. Jones' practice is that when he allocates huge government loans, he sends people to accompany the money to make sure how it is used." The Chinese do not object to this, as evidenced by the "significant progress" made under the leadership of Lieutenant General Wedemeyer. "If Wedemeyer could continue the excellent work he started in wartime in peacetime, I am sure we would have no problems now."

Chennault separately appealed for China to the Congressional Joint Committee on Foreign Aid and the Senate Armed Services Committee, and mentioned his emotional connection to China, including his Chinese wife. His wife was always present during Mr. Chen's testimony. Mr. Chen expressed his willingness to sell his airline operating in China and contribute his own strength to the U.S. aid program to China. After attending the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. Chen told the press that he expected the CCP to be blocked in Changsha and Hengyang, which are the main routes into the interior and south of China.

Approximately One Million Yuan is Needed Daily

According to Senator Tydings, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Chennault estimated that maintaining the operation "would cost approximately one million yuan per day." Asked how long this expenditure would last, Mr. Tydings replied that this involves "any possible plan that can be effective," so he could not comment.

Chennault also told reporters that he believed General Bai Chongxi would retreat from Hankou to Changsha, and that both Changsha and Hengyang were easy to defend. Mr. Chen avoided answering directly the question of whether President Chiang would take over the active leadership of defending South China, saying only, "I believe they have already drafted a plan to defend the area, and I don't think they will waste lives trying to hold Hankou." Mr. Chen also said that the Communists only have two possible routes to South China: one is by sea and the other is by land, from the Hangzhou and Hankou areas, along the railway and highway lines to Changsha and Hengyang. The Communist army will not move along the sea route. If they move along the land route, if the National Army strongly defends Changsha, the Communist army will not be able to cross Changsha. Therefore, the United States must provide assistance so that it can hold the area. Asked why Taiwan would be difficult to defend if the mainland fell, Mr. Chen replied, "It cannot be used as a base for attack." He also said that he had not spoken to MacArthur recently, but his opinion was based on MacArthur's views, because when the Communist army occupied Shenyang, MacArthur had asked Washington to send four divisions to strengthen Japan's defense forces. MacArthur's request indicated that MacArthur believed that the Communist army's gains in the north had already threatened Japan from the side. The Communist "chain reaction" throughout the Far East poses a major threat.

The Core of Resisting the Communist Party

Chennault pointed out that the five provinces of China and the Northwest, where Muslim forces are strong, are the potential core of resisting Communism, saying, "If we decide that for national security reasons, we must adopt a concrete action policy in Asia, aimed at containing and suppressing the Communists in Asia, then in addition to the money of American taxpayers, there are many other forces that can be used to fight and work. The traditional forces of local autonomy have always been strong in Guangdong, Hunan, Guangxi, Yunnan, Sichuan, and the Muslim Northwest of China, and their leaders have the determination to resist being conquered.

U.S. Senator Knowland Requests Wedemeyer to Testify

[United Press, Washington, 4th] The movement to add provisions for military assistance to the Nationalist Chinese government to the arms aid plan for Europe showed signs on the 4th, with Republican Senator Knowland stating that he would propose the above amendment when the arms bill is submitted to Congress. The military aid bill will be submitted for discussion after the Senate approves the Atlantic Treaty.

Knowland also stated that he would request Lieutenant General Wedemeyer to testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee, as Chennault testified before the oversight committee on the 4th.

Democratic Senator McClellan, chairman of the "Oversight Committee," said he was very satisfied with Chennault's testimony and that public opinion would pressure Congress to pass his aid to China bill.

Meanwhile, Senator Connally, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that his committee was busy listening to the Atlantic Treaty and had no time to take action on Senator Knowland's request for a full investigation into U.S. policy toward China.

### Acting President Li Takes Advantage of the Rest Period to Carefully Consider the Current Situation; Will Go to Guangzhou to Preside Over Major Plans Upon Making a Decision

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 4th] Acting President Li returned to Guilin from Nanjing on April 23, and it has been nearly ten days since then. According to the spokesman of the Presidential Office, Acting President Li has been overworked in the past few months and needs to rest for a while before going to Guangzhou. However, the situation is so precarious that various parties have speculated about his delay, and the central and local party, government, and military leaders in Guangzhou are particularly anxious. In addition to repeatedly calling for him to go to Guangzhou to preside over national affairs, they also sent representatives to earnestly welcome him. In order to understand the truth, the reporter visited a certain authoritative person close to the acting president, who told him that Acting President Li's leadership of the country this time is aimed at seeking peace and reforming politics. In order to realize peace, he has tried his best with the highest sincerity and the greatest effort, so despite being criticized by the party and outsiders and ridiculed by the CCP, he still persisted in his original intention and continued to carry out his work. Unexpectedly, the CCP put forward the "Domestic Peace Agreement," the terms of which are so harsh that they are tantamount to forcing us to surrender unconditionally, which is unacceptable to our government and the military and civilians of the whole country. Acting President Li telegraphed the CCP again, asking them to reconsider, but the CCP brazenly ignored it and used force, causing our compatriots who have been living in dire straits for a long time to suffer the misery of war. Acting President Li is deeply saddened. As for reforming politics, it has been a pity that nothing has been achieved in the past three months due to the situation. At present, the situation is becoming more and more serious, and Acting President Li is even more convinced that without thorough reform and hard work, it is impossible to inspire people's hearts, unite the forces of democracy and progress, and jointly seek salvation. Therefore, during the period of resting in Guilin, he is making a comprehensive and careful consideration of the current situation and is exchanging opinions with military and political officials in Guangzhou at any time. Finally, the authoritative person also stated that Acting President Li will go to Guangzhou to preside over major plans after the above considerations have been decided.

### The Control Yuan Passed a Temporary Motion to Telegraph Acting President Li to Urge Him to Go; Also Revised and Approved the Main Points of Future Work

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th] The Control Yuan meeting passed a temporary motion this afternoon to telegraph Acting President Li to urge him to come to Guangzhou as soon as possible to preside over major plans. The telegram will be drafted by the secretariat and sent out immediately. The 50th meeting of the Control Yuan continued to be held this morning at the Provincial Audit Office. Chairman Yu Youren first discussed the proposal on the Yuan's future work submitted by Qiu Niantai and revised by the Tang Honglie and other five-person groups. The debate lasted for two hours, and finally the main points of future work were revised and approved as follows: (1) Promote unity among all parties, concentrate the strength of the whole country, earnestly take responsibility, and reorganize the revolutionary array. (2) Urge the government to implement comprehensive reforms and assist its reform measures. Strengthen the work of the Yuan, rectify the political atmosphere, stabilize the economy, inspire morale, and inspire people's hearts. The specific implementation methods for the above work will be decided by the committees after research and sealing. The proposal submitted by Qiu Niantai, Li Tingjun, Chen Fangxian, and others that Guangzhou postal and telecommunications fees, following railway and highway transportation fees in Hunan, Hubei, and other places, should be changed to silver yuan and the fee value should be increased, and should be corrected separately, was decided to be submitted to the Finance and Food Administration Committee for review. The three committee members Qiu, Li, and Chen also proposed to designate Taiwan Province as a resettlement area for the families of Yuan personnel and prepare for relocation and resettlement as soon as possible. After the proposal was explained, voices of opposition arose. President Yu was the first to say that the Control Yuan must not set this bad precedent. He said, "If all agencies are like this, the government will collapse"! Tang Honglie, Li Zhengle, Zhang Dinghua, and others all spoke against it. Tang Honglie said, "The Taipei Central Daily News has already published articles scolding the "political garbage" who moved to Taiwan. Do we also want to squeeze into the garbage dump"! Amid a chorus of opposition, the proposal was finally rejected.

### Editorial: Curb the Soaring Public Utility Index

The pricing index for public utilities has soared in recent days, reaching 1.25 million times on the 5th. Although Mayor Chen is just taking office and has many things to deal with, in view of the excessive charges for public utilities, which greatly affect the livelihood of the city's 6 million citizens, he reduced it to 890,000 times. Mayor Chen's concern for the people's livelihood is certainly admirable; however, the reduction to 890,000 times is still unaffordable for the general public, because the salary index for public and education personnel is only 100,000 times, and even the cost of living index for employees of general factories and companies is only 370,000 times, how can they afford 890,000 times for public utilities! In today's stormy weather, everyone should embrace the spirit of "riding out the storm together," and work together with one heart and one mind to overcome the crisis; by no means should there be a mentality of "taking advantage of the fire," especially since public utilities are closely related to the people's livelihood, and their charges should take into account the ability of citizens to pay. Moreover, in the past few days, because of the stability of the situation and the slight peace of mind of the people, general prices have rebounded, and only public utilities have risen alone. The index on May 3 was only 790,000 times, and on the 4th it soared to 1.25 million times. Regardless of the calculation standard, this unreasonable rise is obvious at a glance.

The issue of public utility charges has always been one of the most difficult things in Shanghai's municipal administration. In early March, the public utility authorities came up with a whimsical idea to use the "customs gold unit" as the unit of calculation, so that the price of public utilities could rise every day, only caring about their own interests and disregarding the livelihood of the general public; this absurd "automatic adjustment formula" was first criticized by the media, and the Municipal Council, representing public opinion, was also extremely angry and unanimously expressed opposition. This method of "only knowing interests and disregarding the people's livelihood" was finally forced to be abandoned, and a new method of pricing based on the cost of living index was adopted. However, in less than two months, various public utilities shouted "unaffordable" and threatened to "lose too much money and cannot maintain it." The Municipal Council had no choice but to allow the various public utilities to change to a method of adjusting prices daily based on the price index. However, fearing that the various public utilities would ask for exorbitant prices, it decided on two measures: (1) Please the municipal government to handle the matter at its discretion within the principle of maintaining the continuous supply of public utilities and taking into account the ability of citizens to pay; (2) Conduct a trial run for one month first.

The trial run started on April 25, and all public utilities such as water, electricity, telephone, tram, and public bus were charged at the index of 140,000 times on the 25th. On the 29th, it was changed to 157,000 times. Based on the price situation at that time, 140,000 to 150,000 times was considered fair and reasonable, and the general public praised the public utility bureau for handling it properly. However, in less than a few days, the public utility index became a hit, reaching 590,000 times on May 2, 790,000 times on the 3rd, and 1.25 million times on the 4th. Within ten days, it rose nine times, exceeding any price. The public utility bureau will explain to the citizens how the index is calculated. I wonder what they will say? The unreasonableness of the rise is obvious at a glance, why bother deceiving yourself and others!

We don't need to talk in high-sounding terms. Even with the facts, we can see that the price increase of public utilities is too excessive. For example, the price of trams and public buses was adjusted on May 3, and the index on which it was based was 750,000 times. The tram fare starts from 80,000 yuan and ends at 190,000 yuan; the public bus fare starts from 80,000 yuan and ends at 220,000 yuan. Two people go out and share a pedicab, and the fare they pay is even lower than taking a tram or public bus. Is the purpose of public utilities to serve or to make money? On the day of the May 3 adjustment, we witnessed many passengers being forced to get off because they did not have enough money in their pockets. If it is calculated at 1.25 million times today, then the general public, especially the salaried class, will sigh at the sight of trams and public buses, and those who can afford to ride trams or public buses will be regarded as rich customers by the general public. Is there anything more absurd in the world!

Also, from May 3 to 4, prices in Shanghai fell across the board. Gold and banknotes fell by 30%, and other commodities also fell accordingly. Even rice, oil, coal, and firewood were relatively stable. How could it rise from 790,000 times to 1.25 million times overnight? The public utilities' disregard for the livelihood of the citizens is obvious, and there is no need to say more.

In this turbulent period, defending Greater Shanghai and stabilizing the people's livelihood is the top priority, and public utilities are related to the livelihood of every citizen. We must not allow them to soar and charge without standards, making every citizen feel threatened in their life. We ask Mayor Chen to stop the soaring index of public utilities at any time. It is best to end this temporary one-month trial run early and restore a reasonable method of calculation based on the cost of living index. The Public Utility Bureau has the responsibility to supervise and manage public utilities, and Mayor Chen should order the Public Utility Bureau to assume the responsibility of reasonably adjusting the prices of public utilities.

### The Soviet Union Agrees to the Western Proposal; The Berlin Blockade Will Be Lifted on the 12th of This Month; The Foreign Ministers' Conference Will Be Held in Paris on the 23rd

[This newspaper] Washington, 4th Broadcast: According to reliable sources obtained today, the Soviet Union is willing to accept May 12 as the date for simultaneously lifting the Berlin blockade and the Western counter-blockade, and May 23 as the date for convening the four-power foreign ministers' conference, which will be held in Paris. The U.S. State Department spokesman announced on the morning of the 4th that the four-power representatives will meet in New York at 4:30 p.m. (Universal Time) to discuss the detailed steps for lifting the blockade and convening the foreign ministers' conference. Representatives from the United Kingdom and France will participate in the negotiations on lifting the blockade for the first time. The spokesman convened reporters this morning to report on the progress of the negotiations on the Berlin issue between U.S. representative Jessup and Soviet representative Malik in New York, and said that the informal negotiations had progressed to the stage where details could be considered, so he invited representatives from the United Kingdom and France to jointly participate in the negotiations.

[United Press, New York, 4th] Diplomatic officials said on the 4th that the Berlin blockade negotiations were rapidly approaching a showdown. It is said that the fate of this major negotiation will initially depend on the Soviet Union's response to the Western proposal. The West has requested to end the talks between the U.S. and the Soviet Union and replace them with four-power consultations. The tense situation regarding the outcome of the talks apparently increased on the 3rd. U.S. Ambassador-at-Large Jessup, British Ambassador to the United Nations Jebb, and French Ambassador to the United Nations Chauvel were all in their offices all day waiting for the Soviet Union's response. They hope to begin discussions this week on the technical details of lifting the Soviet blockade of Berlin and the Western counter-blockade, as well as the agenda of the proposed four-power foreign ministers' conference. It is said that Malik "fully understands" the Western proposal to lift the blockade in early next week and decide on a date for convening a four-power conference in Paris two weeks later. Western officials did not deny the possibility that Jessup and Malik might hold another round of talks, but said that this meeting would only be held to arrange for Jebb and Chauvel to participate in the final stage of consultations.

[Reuters, Berlin, 3rd] The Berlin American Evening News reported that well-informed Soviet sources revealed that at the next four-power foreign ministers' conference to discuss the German issue, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will make "amazing concessions." The Soviet military headquarters in Berlin revealed that the Soviet representative to the United Nations will return to Moscow on May 22 to report to the Kremlin. The Foreign Ministers' Conference may be convened around June 1. The newspaper said that Vyshinsky will suggest the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany, with its central institutions located in Berlin. The prerequisite for this move will be mutual recognition of the East German People's Council and the West German Parliament in Bonn. The newspaper also said that the Soviet Union is even planning to make other concessions so that the United States can abandon its plan to organize West Germany.

### The U.S. Military Governor in Germany, Clay, Has Resigned and His Resignation Has Been Approved; The Vacancy Will Be Filled by One Civilian Official and One Military Officer; McCloy and Clark Are the Most Likely Candidates

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 3rd] President Truman announced today that U.S. Military Governor in Germany General Clay will leave office on May 15. Clay's two senior deputies, Lieutenant General Huebner and Major General Hays, "will temporarily assume Clay's duties until a senior civilian commissioner is appointed." The President said that he had granted Clay's resignation at his "repeated request." "General Clay has completed a difficult administrative task. His name will be associated with one of the most difficult tasks and achievements in American history."

[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] After the resignation of Clay, the Governor of the U.S. Military Government in Germany and Commander of the U.S. Army, his vacancy will be filled by one civilian official and one military officer. On the civilian side, McCloy will handle the administration of the occupied area with the title of Commissioner; on the military side, a military officer will command the U.S. Army in Europe and Germany, with General Clark or Lieutenant General Wedemeyer being the most likely candidates.

[Associated Press, Washington, 4th] President Truman is urging International Bank Chairman McCloy to succeed Clay as the head of the U.S. military occupation zone in Germany. McCloy, who previously served as an Assistant Secretary of War, will be the first high-ranking civilian official in Germany if he takes on the new position. The conversion of the military government to a civilian government was agreed upon last month in Washington by the United States, Britain, and France, and is also related to the plan to merge the three occupied zones of West Germany. McCloy will also serve as a member of the Allied High Commission, which will be responsible for supervising the organization and development of the future new West German state.

### German Communist Leader Goes to Moscow

[United Press, Berlin, 3rd] Germans said on the 13th that German Communist leader Pieck had gone to Moscow to discuss the German situation with the Soviet Central Politburo. Pieck and Grotewohl are both chairmen of the German Socialist Unity Party, which was formed by the merger of the Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party. Grotewohl was the leader of the Social Democratic Party before the merger. In view of the progress of the negotiations between the East and West on lifting the Berlin blockade, Pieck's visit to Moscow is particularly important at this time. If the New York talks are successful, the entire policy of the German Communist Party may be re-determined.

### Dewey Visits Western Europe, Claims No Political Mission

### U.S. Chief of Staff Urges Approval of the Atlantic Treaty

Appears before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to Testify

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] U.S. Army Chief of Staff Bradley appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is reviewing the Atlantic Treaty, today and emphasized that the first line of defense for the United States is in the heart of Europe. He said that Americans know that American money or weapons themselves cannot give Europe security. Western Europe must save itself. In the last war, in the first ten days of the Normandy landings, the U.S. military suffered 21,000 casualties. It is hoped that there will be no more such risky military operations in the future. The way to avoid it is to give the Western European armies adequate equipment and training so that they are constantly in a state of preparedness. It is believed that after obtaining the guarantee of assistance and the tools of resistance, Western Europe will be able to resist any threat of aggression. Bradley also pointed out that the eleven countries of the Atlantic Treaty have a population of over 300 million, and their natural resources and manufacturing capabilities for weapons are extremely rich and superior, which will make a very significant contribution to Western security.

### Canada Submits Instrument of Ratification of the Treaty

### European Recovery Program Has Produced Results

Acheson Delivers Speech

[Reuters Washington, 3rd] U.S. Secretary of State Acheson stated today in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that forces of freedom and democracy can be encouraged by recent developments in Western Europe. Since the promotion of the European Recovery Program, totalitarian forces in Western Europe have been unable to make further progress. In every important election in Western Europe, the people have clearly expressed their support for constitutional government. Especially in France and Italy, the Communist Party's attempts to obstruct recovery have been defeated by strong government action. Workers have gradually recognized the threat of Communist revolts. Due to the increasing belief of the people in the future, production has increased accordingly, and finance has tended towards stability. Acheson continued, stating that to maintain the momentum of economic recovery, the Atlantic Pact must be supplemented by a military aid program to provide security for stable forces. The momentum of economic recovery stimulated by U.S. aid has been disturbed by the threat of armed aggression. The North Atlantic Treaty can reduce this anxiety, allowing the people of Western Europe to devote their full efforts to the cause of recovery.

### Australian Foreign Minister Again Appeals to U.S. Not to Ignore Asian Situation Communist Forces Penetrating Deeply Will Be Impossible to Resist

[United Press Washington, 3rd] Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated on the 3rd that the U.S.-Soviet talks to lift the Berlin blockade are progressing very satisfactorily. He issued this statement after a secret meeting between the Foreign Relations Committee and UN General Assembly President, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt. Evatt has been in close contact with Jessup and Malik regarding their talks. Connally told reporters that the Jessup-Malik talks were "full of harmony" and expressed Evatt's great hope for reaching an agreement.

Evatt took this opportunity to warn the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the U.S. should not overemphasize the European situation, expressing his concern about the Communist progress in the Far East. The penetration of Communist forces has expanded to India, Burma, and other regions of the Pacific. He stated that the Communist progress in China is at least partly due to the U.S.'s neglect of Asia. The true purpose of Evatt's consultation with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has not been revealed, as, according to tradition, the Senate's main committees have never listened to the testimony of any foreigners. When Evatt was asked what was discussed in the meeting, he replied that the meeting was merely an "exchange of views between old friends," and he will meet with President Truman on the 4th. Regarding the situation in the Pacific, Evatt expressed deep concern that the U.S.'s neglect of Asia has led to the feeling that the U.S. does not care about Asia and that the progress of Soviet-backed Communist forces will be irresistible. It is reported that Evatt also stated that Australia is concerned about the revival of Japanese military power but supports the economic reconstruction of Japan.

### Ingrid Bergman's Romantic Chapter Falls in Love With Director, Wants to Divorce Husband

After this affair, there have been many criticisms from Italians, and even the left-wing Republican newspaper asked Ingrid, "How can it be, Ingrid, that you would do this too?"

### Full Text of Agreements Between Chinese Communists, Burmese Communists, and North Korea

[Central News Agency Yangon, April 24th Dispatch] The Chinese Communists launched a war of chaos in the country, actually seeking to communize China and make it a vassal of the Soviet Union. The historical facts of the past two decades fully prove this. However, a small number of intellectuals and democratic countries, such as Britain and the United States, were deceived by the false propaganda of the Communist Party and its fellow travelers, mistakenly believing that the Chinese Communists were nationalists or a rural political faction and had no connection with the Soviet Union or world communism. It was not until Mao Zedong's worldwide broadcast on April 4th, attacking the North Atlantic Treaty and declaring that he would lead China to fight for the Soviet Union, that the true face of the Chinese Communists was revealed to the world. Furthermore, observing the recent agreements signed between the Chinese Communists and the Burmese Communist Party and the North Korean government, it is even clearer that the Chinese Communists intend to conquer Asia and launch a global anti-democracy and anti-freedom struggle. The content of the two agreements is as follows:

(A) On February 25th, the Chinese Communists secretly sent Zhang Huihua, Chen Jiakang, and Du Shuhua as representatives to sign a mutual assistance agreement with the Burmese Communists in Pingman, Burma. The terms are as follows: (1) Both parties firmly engage in the task of liberating Southeast Asia. The strategies and tactics of action steps must be coordinated. (2) Exchange intelligence on strategic actions against Anglo-American imperialism. (3) Anti-imperialist actions in Southeast Asia must take international resolutions as their target. (4) If necessary, the Chinese Communists will use military force to directly support the Burmese Communists on the Sino-Burmese border and further serve as an outpost. (5) The All-Burma Federation of Labor, the All-Burma People's Democratic Youth League, and the All-Burma Student Union shall make contact with local Chinese Communist organizations.

(B) The representative of the North Korean People's Democratic Government, Zhu Xianyong, and the representative of the Chinese Communist Party, Lin Feng, signed a supplementary mutual assistance agreement in Moscow on March 17th. The content is as follows: (1) The signatories shall, on the basis of mutual assistance and equality, jointly resist any aggressive forces. (2) If one of the signatories is attacked by any imperialist, it shall be considered an attack on the entire population of both parties and shall immediately cooperate, act jointly, and fight side by side. (3) The Chinese Communist Party shall exert all its efforts to support the North Korean people in striving for Korean independence, unification, and peaceful democratic development. (4) Between July 1, 1949, and August 30, 1950, the Chinese Communist Party shall fully support North Korea with Northeast military supplies, materials, and personnel. (5) Existing Japanese technical personnel and Japanese military supplies in the Northeast region shall be given priority for use by North Korea. (6) Exchange materials with each other according to the needs of the economic development of the two peoples. (7) To enhance the external trade links between the two parties, a chain should be formed for expansion. (8) In the struggle for peace and cooperation in the Far East and the world, both parties shall support all efforts to protect the Soviet Union's security and peaceful policies and defend against the conspiracies and offensives of imperialism.

### The British Labour Party

— Written by Brailsford, Translated by Song Guihuang

In 1924, on a memorable evening, I had a conversation with a taxi driver in London. That day was the day that MacDonald organized the first Labour cabinet. The driver was not very concerned about his fare but was excitedly discussing the national affairs of the time with me. As he talked about the new Prime Minister, his eyes shone, as if I could still see it today. He said, "He is one of our team. He was born in an iron factory." Today, the Labour Party has become a recognized institution, but among manual workers, there is still a legend about it. This legend is still fresh and interesting, sufficient for conversation, and embodies the hopes of the workers.

Only because of the Labour Party did the workers first have the opportunity to exert their power on the course of national destiny. Today, children born in working-class families no longer need to be like their grandfathers, feeling "inferior" innately. Today, they are no longer the obedient servants of the hereditary ruling class.

The Pioneer Era

The expansion of the power base like this has happened twice in British history. The liberation of the middle class took two hundred years, from the time of the Civil War to the first Reform Act. The laboring class obtaining its political equal status took one hundred years. First, Robert Owen led the "Grand National Consolidated Trades Union" to engage in fervent struggles in 1834. By 1945, the Labour Party matured by forming the first cabinet with a majority of Labour Party members, and thus the final goal was achieved. The first half-century was the era of pioneers, the era of Owenites, Chartists, Morris, Hyndman, etc. The actual record of the Labour Party only began in 1899, when Keir Hardie persuaded the "Trade Union Congress" to establish the "Labour Representation Committee." The Labour Party emerged from this committee in 1906.

Like any other political party, the Labour Party's origins are two-pronged. On the one hand, it seeks to benefit a particular social class, namely the workers, and on the other hand, it pursues the realization of an idea, namely the realization of socialism. This concept of a labour alliance is unique to Britain. There is no such situation in any other country. On the European continent, members of the Socialist Party join as individuals. Only in Britain do workers join the Labour Party through their trade unions, and after nearly a century of struggle, workers have remained loyal to their unions. Owen also adopted this policy when he first launched the labor movement.

The Fabians are also a part of the socialists in the British labour alliance. They are a small group, consisting of middle-class intellectuals, led by thinkers such as Webb, Shaw, and Wells, who exerted a decisive influence. However, what largely made the trade unions embrace the idea of independent political action was the "Independent Labour Party" founded by Hardie in 1893. Hardie was originally a miner who, having endured the pain of hunger, cold, and unemployment in his youth, deeply knew how to care for workers and share their joys and sorrows. His main task was to persuade the elders not to rely on the Liberal Party, which still believed in "laissez-faire policies." At first, he pointed out that the interests of the workers could not be hoped for from a party that was controlled and subsidized by their employers. Then he preached the warm, idealistic, and socialist gospel, with particular emphasis on ethics and morality. His doctrine is a doctrine of democracy. He does not resort to revolutionary rhetoric.

The "Labour Representation Committee" initially adopted a neutral policy. At that time, it had no funds, and only a quarter of the members of the national trade unions initially participated in it. The essence of the Labour Party lies in the two legal resolutions that regulate the basis of the activities of the trade unions. In 1900, the "National Union of Railwaymen" was ordered to compensate the Taff Vale Railway Company for the losses suffered due to the strike. This was tantamount to disarming every trade union. The workers had lost the effective use of their only weapon in the industrial struggle—the right of solidarity.

At the same time, in 1903, some trade unions levied fees from their members to fund election campaigns. Therefore, in 1906, the Labour Party occupied seats in the House of Commons for the first time in its name, with 29 seats, and Hardie served as Chairman. The second challenge came with the Osborne Judgment in 1909. The judgment declared levying campaign activity fees illegal and stipulated that all political activities of trade unions were heinous crimes. It was in this year that the miners, who had always been staunch Liberal Party members, joined the Labour Party. In 1910, the Labour Party had 40 members in the House of Commons, thus defeating the Liberal government. Partly due to pressure and partly due to being able to appeal to a sense of justice, it finally won the reversal of the Liberal Party and had the Taff Vale and Osborne Judgments overturned. By this point, the labouring masses had realized that the Labour Party was indispensable, just to protect their industrial interests. Hardie believed that the socialist workers of Europe only needed to threaten a general strike to prevent war. But by 1914, with the demise of this fantasy, he became discouraged. (To be continued)

### U.S. Plans to Recognize Legitimate Interests in Vietnamese and Indonesian National Movements Arms Supply to French Army Seems to Be Confirmed

[Reuters Washington, 3rd] A State Department spokesman, in responding to newspaper reports that the U.S. plans to supply arms to the French army in Vietnam, stated that if the "legitimate interests" of nationalist elements in Vietnam and Indonesia are realized, the possibility of the expansion of communism in Southeast Asia can certainly be reduced. While the spokesman did not directly comment on the issue of supplying arms to the French army, he stated, "There is no need to reiterate the position that the U.S. government has repeatedly stated before, that the U.S. is extremely hopeful that France and the Netherlands can peacefully resolve their differences with the Vietnamese and Indonesians. The U.S.'s interest in this matter has not diminished at all." The spokesman also said that he was not aware of the rumor that a Southeast Asian anti-communist defense conference will be convened as soon as France and the Netherlands resolve their difficulties in Southeast Asia. According to the report, participants in the Southeast Asian anti-communist defense conference will include the United States, Britain, France, India, Thailand, Burma, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

Order for Today's Two Women's Round Robin Finals

To ensure an early conclusion to the fourth Mayor's Cup basketball tournament, three matches are scheduled for today, starting at 5:00 PM. The women's round robin finals will take up two of those slots, with the Green Team facing the Li Team and the Ya Team challenging the Ying Team. The other match will be a men's consolation bracket semi-final between Dong Hua and the Pu Team to determine who will advance. All matches will be held at the Municipal Gymnasium. Tickets are 200,000 yuan upstairs, 400,000 yuan downstairs, and 800,000 yuan for reserved seats. The schedule and referee list are as follows:

Li Team vs. Ying Team (Women's Round Robin) 5:00 PM

Green Team vs. Ya Team (Women's Round Robin) 5:45 PM

Dong Hua vs. Pu Team (Men's Consolation Bracket Semi-Final) 6:30 PM

In the first women's round robin final, the Li Team will meet the Ying Team. The former is the runner-up in this year's league, with agile and skilled young players. However, their smaller stature may put them at a disadvantage under men's rules. In their first match against the Ya Team, they only managed to win in overtime. Led by Wang Shan, the Ying Team boasts talents such as Yang Shu Jun, Huang Pin Zhen, and Wang Can Hua, who are full of energy. They posed a significant threat to the league champions, the Green Team, in their previous encounter, losing by only seven points. Their match against the Li Team today is expected to be evenly matched, making the outcome uncertain.

In the other women's final, the Green Team will face the Ya Team. The Ya Team's roster includes famous players such as Sun Feng Zhu, Zhu Min, Qian Meng Yue, and Zhu Lan Zhen. Newcomer Wang Ze Lun's performance is especially promising. After losing to the Li Team, they have been reinvigorated and are determined to restore their reputation. Tonight, they face another formidable opponent, and a cautious approach should lead to outstanding results. The Green Team is one of the best women's basketball teams in the city. Their lineup includes outstanding talents such as Ming Yuan, Zong, Jin Yun, and Zhen Man Li, who are sharp on offense and strong on defense. They are invincible, and the Ya Team will likely find it difficult to escape their fate.

### Three Group B Table Tennis League Matches This Evening

The organizing committee of the fourth Table Tennis League has recently stated that some teams have reported insufficient funds to purchase balls, which has affected their practice matches. They have requested assistance in resolving this issue. The committee has reached an agreement with the China Table Tennis Company to provide "Champion" brand hard balls for team practice at a low price. Teams participating in the league can use their deposit as payment for up to four dozen balls. From today (the 5th) to the 10th, teams can collect their balls from the General Secretary, Mr. Chen Lin Sheng, at 194 Nanjing East Road, Hua Lian Tong Le Hui, between 1:00 PM and 3:00 PM daily, upon presentation of their deposit receipt. Three Group B matches will continue today (the 5th). In Group B2, Public Transport will face China Farmers. The former has already forfeited once, and if they are absent again, their qualification will be revoked. In the same group, Spark is unlikely to be a match for Postal Services. In Group B3, the ever-victorious Starlight will face Silk Red. The latter has a slightly worse record, but with veterans like Lin Chang Xin participating, coupled with their victory over the strong Insurance Cup team, American Asia, the day before, they will offer strong resistance. The schedule for today and the results of previous matches are listed below:

Today's Schedule

### Unprecedented Fire on Kai Xuan Road: 20,000 People Displaced, Over 3,000 Homes Destroyed Including Factories, Western-Style Houses, and Shantytowns

[Reported by this newspaper] The shantytowns along Kai Xuan Road and Chang Ning Road intersection (i.e., West Xin Street) in Western Shanghai, numbered more than several thousand households. Unexpectedly, at approximately 2 PM yesterday, a fire broke out in a shanty home in the 16th Bao due to a cooking mishap. Flames immediately engulfed the area, quickly spreading to all the shantytowns south of Chang Ning Road, dozens of small factories, and municipal houses, including the China Chemical Factory and the Qi Xin Rubber Factory, which were almost completely destroyed. Simultaneously, the fire spread to the shops along the street north of the road, also affecting the Yuan Yuan Rubber Factory and two large Western-style houses in Su Jia Jiao behind it. At this point, the fire intensified, and dozens of small industrial factories nearby, including tanneries, leather factories, enamel factories, wire nail factories, and chemical factories, were all burned down. Subsequently, the fire spread along Chang Ning Road into the Hua Yuan Fang neighborhood, destroying seven Western-style houses, numbers 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15. Upon receiving the report, the Fire Department, led by Chief Zhou and Chief Ye, rushed to the scene with reinforcements from the General Brigade. Units from Song Shan, Xin Kai He, Jing An Temple, Yi Chang Road, Xin Zha, Shen Jia Wan, and Wu Xing Road also arrived successively, along with civilian fire brigades. In addition to all the brigades from the North and South cities, the Fa Hua and Zhen Ru fire brigades also rushed to assist. However, the area lacked hydrant water sources, making connections difficult. They even resorted to relaying water from the Zhong Shan Park pond. Despite the efforts of the firefighters, their effectiveness was limited due to the time and effort required. Moreover, the factories contained flammable materials such as rubber and chemical raw materials, which, once ignited, made the situation even more uncontrollable. After the fire broke out, Liu Yao Chen, the Deputy Chief of the Fa Cao Police Precinct in charge, along with Section Chief Lu Xiu Duan, Inspector Zhu Yun Zhang, patrol officers, uniformed police, and all the volunteer police, arrived at the scene to maintain order. After 4 PM, reporters drove to the intersection of Yu Yuan Road and Jiang Su Road and saw that the road was blocked by onlookers, and vehicles traveling west were all turning back. Dozens of fire trucks lined up west of Zhong Shan Park, resembling a long snake formation, and the road was flooded with water above the ankles. Upon arriving at the scene, under the guidance of Chief Ye and Section Chief Lu, they inspected the surrounding area. Embers were still smoldering on both sides of the road, making it feel like being in a furnace, which was truly unbearable. Upon reaching the origin of the fire, they saw a charred body lying on the side of the road, resembling a burnt log, a truly tragic sight. In the distance, several Western-style houses in Hua Yuan Fang were engulfed in flames, and firefighters were working diligently. During the height of the fire, several firefighters were injured, including Qu Shang Wen, the Deputy Squad Leader of the Xin Zha Road Unit, a police officer from 69 Yi Chang Road, and officers Tao Yong Fu and Chen Dun Ran, who were injured in falls and being crushed. All were taken to the Police Hospital for treatment. The fire was extinguished around 6 PM. It is reported that the fire area was approximately 200,000 square meters, affecting over 3,000 homes in three "bao", leaving approximately 20,000 people displaced. Along the roads, boxes and blankets were piled up like mountains. The extent of the losses cannot be estimated at this time. As far as is known, there were two deaths and more than ten injuries. Afterwards, Mayor Chen Liang, Police Chief Mao Sen, and Deputy Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Chen Bao Tai, concerned about the affected victims, arrived at the scene one after another to discuss disaster relief. The Mayor ordered that the victims be temporarily housed in nearby schools and community organizations. Meanwhile, appeals for relief will be launched to all sectors of society by various charitable organizations, and it is hoped that philanthropists in Shanghai will actively contribute. According to Chief Ye, the fire was the worst conflagration in recent decades. Over 500 people participated in the rescue effort. Two pump trucks were burned, and many water hoses were damaged. He also stated that the fire was caused by the difficulty of obtaining water. It is reported that the arsonist is on the run, and the police precinct in charge is investigating.

### Mayor Chen's Broadcast Regarding the Fire in Western Shanghai

[Central News Agency] Mayor Chen broadcasted at 10:30 PM last night on Shanghai Radio regarding the fire in Western Shanghai, stating in brief: At 2:05 PM today, a fire broke out in Su Jia Jiao, West Xin Street, Fa Cao District of this city. More than 3,200 homes were affected, displacing more than 15,000 victims. I, along with the Police, Social Affairs, and Civil Affairs Bureau Chiefs, the Chief of the Municipal Party Committee, and the city's fire brigades, arrived at the scene in a timely manner to carry out rescue work. The fire was extinguished at 6:15 PM. The scene of the victims crying out to heaven was truly heartbreaking. In addition to setting up the Fa Cao District Fire Relief Association in the Hui Er Kang Hotel to handle the aftermath, I ordered the purchase of bread and instructed the Relief Committee to immediately dispatch soup trucks to distribute porridge. I also ordered the concentrated effort of the area's "da bing" shops to quickly make "da bing" and distribute them in groups. All police officers were prepared to work through the night, and I also ordered the District Office and 500 volunteer police to assist, along with the military police, to maintain order in a well-organized manner. Meanwhile, I discussed with nearby schools, factories, and public places to open them all up as temporary shelters, and I also encouraged wealthy families nearby to try their best to accommodate victims. I am deeply saddened and sympathetic to this unfortunate event. I have already launched temporary relief efforts for the affected households, which can be comforting to the citizens. At the same time, I express my deep admiration for the service spirit of all the firefighters, the students of various universities, and the political workers, as well as the colleagues of the military police and the Second Corps.

### All Sectors Commemorate Youth Day, Fang Zhi Delivers Inspirational Speech

Over 300 representatives from all sectors and youth students attended. Zhang Dan Qiu served as chairman, reporting on the significance of the commemoration and calling on youth from all sectors to actively participate in this anti-communist self-defense war, studying to become the new army against the Red Imperialism, the violent ruling group, and the Communist bandits. Then, Fang Zhi, Director of the Municipal Party Committee, delivered a speech, stating in brief: "When we commemorate the 'May Fourth', we must use the consistent spirit of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism to save the nation and the country. We must not hesitate to engage in a life-and-death struggle with the Communist bandits. Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of the country, and there is no shortage of young patriots who sacrifice themselves for the nation and the country. I hope that we can unite and strengthen ourselves to participate in this self-defense war to save the country and educate the people. Shanghai has elite naval, land, and air forces, and solid defensive fortifications. If the Communist bandits dare to invade, we will give them a head-on blow. However, I hope that all youth in the city must demonstrate the glorious spirit of the 'May Fourth' Movement, cooperate with all military actions, go to the suburbs and urban areas to conduct propaganda to comfort the national army, eliminate spies, and rescue the wounded and sick," and so on. Finally, the meeting passed a telegram to acting President Li, urging him to go to Guangzhou to preside over the major military affairs of the country, as well as a telegram to youth across the country.

[Reported by this newspaper] In light of the serious situation and soaring prices, the Social Affairs Bureau is drafting a plan to prevent food shortages and solve the problem of food for workers in the city. The plan is roughly as follows: The government will implement special rice rationing for employees, specifically purchasing from various manufacturers at a fixed price, and distributing it to employees based on a standard of four "dou" of rice per person, which will be deducted from the employee's wages. If the translated amount of the employee's wages is less than four "dou", the employer will subsidize the difference. If it exceeds four "dou", the employer will issue banknotes, silver dollars, or other goods for the excess amount.

[Reported by this newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau is handling the registration of silver dollar trading applications. Yesterday, being the last day, more people went to register, and more than 10,000 people queued up to wait. The office entrance and stairs were filled with applying merchants, making it impossible for the Bureau's staff to enter and exit. Yesterday, they made a great effort to supply forms, issuing 6,000 application forms in the morning and 4,000 application forms in the afternoon, totaling 10,000 forms.

[Reported by this newspaper] After the authorities set a deadline for the recovery of old-style bank notes, representatives of the silver, money, and trust industries in this city, including Chen Duo Ru and Shen Ri Xin, requested that national banks should, according to the daily deposits of each bank, allocate cash and fixed-amount bank notes as much as possible. They specifically visited Director Bi of the Monetary Management Bureau and Director Lin of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank to discuss this. It is reported that the authorities have agreed to relieve the various difficulties caused to the banks by the inability to issue bank notes as much as possible. At the same time, they also requested the banks to complete two points: (1) Starting from the 5th of this month, within three days, the total amount of bank notes recovered by each bank should be reported to the Monetary Management Bureau in a list. (2) Within three days, the total amount of bank notes not yet recovered by each bank should also be reported to the Monetary Management Bureau in a list, and the full amount of reserves for these unrecovered bank notes should be deposited with the Central Bank. Therefore, bank notes that have not been cashed with the banks after three days should be taken to the Central Bank for cashing. It is reported that this measure is to prevent banks from acting cleverly after the deadline.

I am temporarily leaving, but I firmly believe that Shanghai can endure, and I believe that Shanghai will eventually be an important base for a free China. We definitely need this spirit of endurance. Mr. Hu Shi said: "Endure and wait for change." I would like to change the word "wait" to "respond": "Endure and respond to change." We especially need to use self-reliance to bring about external change. Some people ask me what the future holds. I see that the present is certainly difficult, and the future will certainly be even more difficult, but I believe that there will eventually be a day of light. We have confidence, and we need a consistent determination. We don't necessarily need specific and detailed plans, but we have sweat and blood. I hope that our colleagues in the education sector will take on the responsibility of leadership, expressing their thoughts through words and replacing silence with action, and working hard to strive for and protect academic freedom.

In the past, the China Petroleum Company supplied kerosene for the use of public and private school staff. The quantity was determined by the Municipal Government's Public and Private School Staff Material Supply Review Committee, which issued purchase certificates and notification slips.

It is learned that the company, in order to benefit the public and private school staff in the city, is still willing to continue selling the kerosene. The purchase procedures are also simpler than before. That is, all public and private school staff in the city who need kerosene can directly contact the company's Zhongshan Park and Sichuan Road Bridge South gas stations or the Shanghai Sales Office at 17 Huangpu Road to purchase it.

### Rice Prices Slightly Weak, Edible Oil Continues to Rise

The rice market trend showed a slight decline yesterday, due to the weakness of both gold and silver dollars, which dampened public confidence. The price of white japonica and thin indica rice in the North Market fell sharply to the 20 million mark, a decrease of 1.5 million yuan compared to yesterday. High-quality early rice was only traded at 18.5 million yuan, and other types of rice also fell by more than one million yuan. The South Market saw smaller declines, with white japonica at 20.5 million yuan and thin indica at 21.128 million yuan, each down by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Transactions of rice and grains were scattered, with some as small as three to five dan.

Edible oil: The authorities forbade quoting prices in silver dollars, which delayed the start of trading, which gradually opened near noon. The initial price of soybean oil was 92 million yuan, and the closing price was 88 million yuan. Rapeseed oil closed at 72 million yuan, and raw rapeseed barrel oil reached 80 million yuan before closing at 76 million yuan. However, it was not specified whether these prices were in promissory notes or cash, and the prices were several million yuan higher than the previous day. Soybean cake trading did not open.

Flour: The market trend continued to decline, mainly due to the weakness outside the exchange, with sellers showing a strong desire to sell. However, there was a lack of chips in the market, and most buyers were taking a wait-and-see approach, so the spot market was very soft. The initial price of Lao Che flour was 5.5 million yuan, and the closing price fell to 5.2 million yuan. Bingshun flour opened at 4.7 million yuan, and then gradually weakened to close at 4.4 million yuan. The supply and demand for wheat bran were balanced, and the market trend was flat. Large bags were quoted at 4 million yuan.

### Market Loses Its Normal State, Stock Exchange Suspends Meetings

The Securities Exchange decided to suspend market meetings starting from May 5, 1938, after convening the 14th joint meeting of the first board of directors and supervisors, due to the market trading losing its normal state and business being almost at a standstill. Yesterday's trend in the Shanghai stock market was still slightly weak. Popular and unpopular stocks still followed the old path in the market, and prices were quoted with limits. There were no transactions by noon, and off-exchange dark market trading immediately began. However, due to the weakness of all commodities and the flatness of public confidence, trading was also quite quiet. 100,000 shares of Yongsha were quoted at 140 million yuan for promissory notes for purchase and 150 million yuan for sale, but transactions were extremely rare. Dark market prices of Meyer, Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Xinhe were increased by about 100 million yuan, while there was little interest in the remaining stocks. The supply was also scarce, and trading was invisibly sluggish. Except for Huafeng, Taiwan Sugar, and Zhabei Water & Electricity, which were bid for at the upper limit, the rest were quiet and unheard of. The number of attendees also decreased significantly, and there were no customers at the various securities firms, making the past lively scene quite cold.

Gold Bonds Rise to Limit

The trend of gold bonds showed a purchase at the upper limit price of 1,891,200,000 yuan at the opening of the city in the morning. There were no sales at the close, and no transactions throughout the day.

### Gold Market Sentiment is Timid, Low Prices Enter the Two Billion Range

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday's gold market situation was that because the deadline for the recall of promissory notes was approaching and the bank's promissory notes could not be issued starting today, the turnover of chips failed. Coupled with the tightening of money supply, public confidence was even weaker, and the market showed a downward trend amidst a wave of selling. The spot price outside the exchange opened at 230 million and 260 million yuan in the morning, which was the highest price of the day. After opening, the price gradually declined, entering the two billion range, trading at 190 million and 210 million yuan, and once as low as 170 million and 200 million yuan. The noon closing saw a slight rebound to 200 million and 230 million yuan. Afternoon trading was sluggish, with prices falling to 190 million and 220 million yuan.

The US dollar off-exchange remained soft due to more supply than demand. The morning opening was at 4.5 million and 5 million, once as low as 3.8 million and 4.3 million. The noon closing was at 4 million and 4.5 million. In the afternoon, buyers were scarce, and the price fell to 3.8 million and 4.3 million, about 20% lower than the previous day.

### Cash Chips Gradually Increase, Silver Dollars Turn Higher in the Afternoon

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday's silver dollar market was flat with an upward trend. Most general businesses have received their registered licenses and have resumed trading. However, the listed prices varied greatly, and the distance between buying and selling was quite inconsistent. The difference was 200,000 yuan at the low end and as much as 400,000 yuan at the high end. The number of silver dollar dealers on the street has decreased significantly, but underground trading is still very active and extremely secretive. Cash transactions of "big heads" were generally at 3.5 million and 3.8 million yuan in the morning. Promissory note transactions have decreased. Some businesses bought at 5 million and sold at 6 million, some bought at 4.5 million and sold at 5.5 million, and some only bought at 5 million and did not sell. Each business was different. In the afternoon, as the supply of cash chips increased, retail investors had a strong appetite, and the final price of "big heads" rose to 3.8 million and 4 million yuan. There were slight fluctuations in promissory note transactions. Central Bank fixed-amount promissory notes traded at 4 million and 5 million yuan. Bank promissory notes traded at 4.5 million and 5.5 million yuan. Bank promissory notes traded at 5 million and 6 million yuan, up 400,000 yuan compared to the 7th.

### Yarn and Cloth Retreat Together

Cotton yarn: Due to the continued decline in gold prices outside the exchange and the recall of promissory notes from banks starting today, credit in the market tightened, and the trend of money supply was unanimously tightened, so public confidence was very weak, and coarse and fine yarn fell again. 42-count Blue Phoenix traded at 780 million yuan, continuing to fall by 170 million yuan. 40-count and 32-count yarn fell by more than 220 million yuan. 21-count Double Horse single yarn traded at 440 million yuan, falling by 60 million yuan. Spot goods traded at 480 million yuan, falling by 95 million yuan. All yarns below 20-count were weak.

Cotton cloth: Domestic trading has not yet opened. Off-exchange quotes were initially flat and then weakened. Trading became lively around 9:15 am. Selling pressure from all sides increased, and buyers were panic-stricken. Around 10:30 am, the prices of leading fine cloth and Four Gentlemen serge were about 14 million yuan. It was slightly lower than the previous day. Private manufacturers frequently sold off inventory to raise salaries and wages, and the market trend was also weak. Factory prices fluctuated, but the fluctuations were small.

### Public Utility Index Continues to Soar, Will Inevitably Lead to Serious Consequences, Citizens Unable to Afford, Industry and Commerce Unite in Complaint, Hoping the Authorities Will Quickly Correct It

[Report from this newspaper] The pricing index for public utilities in this city has been soaring in the past week, causing great resentment among the citizens of the city. This newspaper has received dozens of letters from all walks of life providing opinions on the "public utility index" and calling for a stop to the soaring prices and questioning them every day. It is unanimously believed that the public and private school staff index is only 100,000 times, and the salary index is only 370,000 times, while yesterday's "public utility index" reached 1.25 million times (still as high as 890,000 times after Mayor Chen's reduction), and is adjusted daily, increasing every day, by tens of thousands of times at least and more than two hundred thousand times at most. The rate of increase is so rapid that it is astonishing. It is found that the public utility index was 140,000 times on April 25, 157,000 times on April 29, 194,000 times on April 30, 452,000 times on May 1, 590,000 times on May 2, 790,000 times on May 3, and 890,000 times on May 4 after the reduction. Today, it has jumped to 950,000 times, with an increase of 9 times in just ten days.

Expenses Payable by an Ordinary Employee

If an ordinary base salary is 80 yuan, multiplied by the cost of living index at the end of April, and assuming that the minimum monthly electricity consumption is 14 degrees, the average base salary is multiplied by 371,344 times. The actual salary received in April, water consumption is 19 degrees, and the settlement of payable water and electricity units is assumed to be 29,700,7520 yuan as follows:

Electricity: 1 to 10 degrees, base price per degree unit 0.220 = base price unit 2.20; 11 to 14 degrees, second degree base price unit 0.274 = total unit 1.70; 3.30 + surcharge 10% = 0.33 = total unit 3.63

Water: 19 degrees, base price per degree unit 0.279 = total unit 5.30

The total of the above two water and electricity items is 8.93 units. If calculated according to today's public utility index of 950,000 times, then it is necessary to pay 8,483,500 yuan in gold yuan, which accounts for 30% of their salary. The remaining 70% is only enough to maintain all other daily life? Moreover, the billing period varies from household to household, and the bills are sent out in the last ten days of the month. With the public utility index rising endlessly, how can the salary class, which relies on the salary of the salary index as income, cope with such an endless burden?

The Consequences of Leading the Price Increase are Worrying

However, people cannot live without water and fire, and they cannot find another way. At this time of tense situation, stability is the first priority. If the price increase is allowed to be endless, not only will it threaten the livelihood of the citizens, but there will be a day when they cannot afford to pay. Even factories, which rely on electricity for power, will be forced to shut down due to excessive electricity expenses, affecting the lives of millions of workers, which is even more serious. Moreover, the last time various public utility companies requested to settle prices in customs gold units, which was opposed and terminated by the Municipal Council, but the fluctuation of customs gold units is determined according to the market price of foreign exchange transfer certificates. Recently, the fluctuations of foreign exchange certificates have not been drastic, so even if prices were settled in customs gold units at that time, the degree of increase may not be as violent as it is now. However, now that the public utility index, which is even higher than customs gold, is being used and not being stopped, how can it be said to be in line with the current situation?

Furthermore, recently, some unscrupulous merchants have raised the prices of their goods. If asked why the price increase is so rapid, they will definitely answer: "Learn from public utilities!" Therefore, the soaring public utility index not only leads the price increase, but also makes the current financial crisis even more chaotic. It is deeply hoped that the municipal and security authorities will take into account the difficulties of the people's livelihood and the crisis of industry in this extraordinary period and quickly remedy the situation.

Councilors Point Out Many Irrationalities

The reporter also interviewed a councilor on this matter. According to him, the soaring public utility index is unreasonable. He cited the following reasons: (1) As far as he knows, all municipal government employees can obtain "water and electricity compensation vouchers", which can be used to offset payments within certain limits. May I ask, why don't other citizens of Shanghai get this kind of preferential treatment? (2) The treatment of public utility company employees is better than that of any other organization. At this time of extraordinary conditions and the implementation of thrift, how can the blood and sweat of 5 million citizens be used to provide a few employees with excessive enjoyment? (3) Recently, the US dollar, silver dollar, and general commodity prices have fallen due to the strict control of the authorities. Why does the public utility index seem to have no fear and soar into the sky? (4) The city has entered a state of war. In order to defend Greater Shanghai and strengthen the combat power, the first priority is to maintain security. Now the city is facing a crisis of total economic collapse. If this continues, the future will be unimaginable. The reason for this is that the repeated soaring of the public utility index is the only factor. In order to solve the current crisis, he suggested: (1) Now that Speaker Pan has left Shanghai for Guangzhou, Deputy Speaker Xu should be asked to immediately convene the Public Utilities Subcommittee of the Council or a full emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures. (2) The military authorities should be requested to jointly take effective measures to stop the situation with Mayor Chen in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.

Cotton Textile Association Calls for Correction

When the Shanghai Cotton Textile Association of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Beijing held a meeting of the standing directors yesterday, it was stated that the industry uses a lot of electricity, and the electricity price index has been adjusted daily, and the rate of increase has exceeded that of general commodities by several times. Although it is said that the calculation of this index has a different standard, it has not yet been announced, which is very incomprehensible. Moreover, at this time of extraordinary circumstances, the operation of various factories has been suspended, and they are unable to pay the huge electricity bills, which are rising endlessly. It was decided to send letters to the Municipal Government, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, the Municipal Industry Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, respectively, calling for a way to correct and suppress the situation. In addition, Zhu Fuyou, Han Zhiming, and Wang Zijian, three directors, were appointed to present the actual difficulties to the above-mentioned agencies and ask for remedy.

### "Orchid Exhibition" in Taiwan, Okinawa is a Piece of "Recovered Land"

— Jing Dong

[Taipei, 26th] An orchid exhibition was held at the Horticultural Experiment Station (affiliated to the Taiwan Provincial Agricultural Experiment Station) in Shilin Township, a suburb of Taipei, for two weeks starting from April 17. There are nearly 10,000 large phalaenopsis orchids and 50,000 to 60,000 small ones, which is truly a grand spectacle. Currently blooming are over a thousand phalaenopsis orchids, over five hundred dendrobium orchids, and over a hundred cymbidium orchids. The most valuable of these are the C. Cltftarii Maya fica and B. Laulra varieties, which are in full bloom and gathered in one room for exhibition. In terms of quality and quantity, it not only breaks the record of past Far East exhibitions, but is also an outstanding performer in world orchid exhibitions. The station was established more than 40 years ago, and this is the sixth exhibition since the retrocession (there were only 250 pots during the Japanese era). There were only three pots in the first exhibition, and only three hundred pots in the fifth exhibition last autumn. Orchids are difficult to cultivate, and the orchids in full bloom this time have been cultivated for at least seven years. In addition, the station is also engaged in citrus breeding, cultivation, and transplantation. It started tropical fruit forest, coffee, grape, and vegetable introduction and cultivation experiments in the spring of 1935.

The person in charge of the Chinese National Trade Corporation in Taiwan stated that the comparison between the daily sales loans and the number of customers entering the store when the company was first established on April 15 last year and the current situation proves that the purchasing power of the compatriots in the province is much weaker than it was a year ago. Over the past year, commodity prices in the province have risen by an average of 30 times. For example, the price of a thermos was 6,000 Taiwan dollars a year ago and is now 200,000 Taiwan dollars. Various shirts cost 4,000 Taiwan dollars each a year ago and now cost 120,000 Taiwan dollars. The company's daily sales loans were 3 million yuan a year ago and are now 100 million yuan. However, the average number of customers entering the store daily is now 5,000, an increase of 1,000 compared to 4,000 a year ago. This shows that the purchasing power of the people in the province is weaker than it was a year ago.

Cai Zhang, Chairman of the Ryukyu Revolutionary Comrades Association in Taiwan, recently made a statement on the Ryukyu issue. He believes that in the current complex international situation, in order to clarify the issue of the Ryukyu Islands' destination, attention from all parties should be awakened again. He said: Unfortunately, after the victory of the United Nations, the international situation changed, and the issue of the Ryukyu Islands' destination violated the United Nations' original sacred measures for the Ryukyu Islands, which caused a deformed situation that was not satisfied by the liberation movement of small and weak nations. It is a pity! It is a matter of course in principle that the Ryukyu Islands should break away from the Japanese territory, and there is no fault in law, economy, history, or ethnicity. On June 5, 1936, the Japanese government's so-called "request to reclaim "Ryukyu" in consideration of Japanese feelings" was actually just an empty argument of the military's disguised imperialists' consistent tactics. He also said: We dare to assert that Japan has already lost any right to speak on the demands of Ryukyu. Ryukyu has been exploited by Japan for more than 70 years, without the original consent of Ryukyu and China. Even if a very small number of Ryukyuans now hope to belong to Japan, this is also a degraded mentality forced by oppression. Most people recognize that they have broken away from Japan and are more aware of the importance of Ryukyu's revival. Ryukyu has been spared from destruction since ancient times, thanks to the protection of its home country, China. The combination of China and Ryukyu is inevitable in principle. He also said: For example, the recent rumors about the status of Taiwan are clearly instigated by international schemers, which is equivalent to the distorted propaganda that deliberately regards Ryukyu and Japan as one and the same. Taiwan should be the eternal territory of China, and Ryukyu should also be a piece of recovered land of China. We must be more vigilant and cooperate sincerely in the future to avoid being fooled by international schemers.

Fu Sinian, President of National Taiwan University, has recently been very reluctant to talk to newspaper reporters. The day before yesterday, by chance, Fu was surrounded by reporters at Taiwan University. He was unwilling to comment on the arrest of students this time. When it came to internal problems at Taiwan University, Fu was very distressed. He said that he had a headache. For example, things inside the school are often stolen recently. Several lenses worth 200 million Taiwan dollars in the instrument room suddenly disappeared. A reward of 5 million yuan was offered, and fortunately both the person and the stolen goods were recovered. In addition, houses in various colleges were sublet, and professors did not attend classes to run solo, asking people to substitute for classes. The substitutes also disappeared. Such things must be sorted out! When it came to political issues, Fu said: At present, because I am the president of the university, it is inconvenient to express political opinions. In fact, I am very bored, but in order to form an atmosphere of academic research in the school, I naturally do not talk about politics, otherwise, if the president can talk about it, then the students can talk about it. Fu used a story as an example. He said: Someone built a new house, and the walls were freshly painted. In order to prevent people from scribbling on the walls, he wrote the words "This wall cannot be painted" on the wall. A naughty child added the sentence "Why do you want to paint?" This person then wrote the sentence "I own the wall, I can paint", but the naughty child then added the sentence "Everyone paints". This is the story that Fu told, and it can also be seen from his mood, so he felt bored. Another reporter asked him if he had seen Soong Tzu-wen this time. He laughed and said: "How can I see him? After I scolded him, we met once, but we didn't talk. Recently, I wanted to go to Caoshan Hot Springs to take a bath and rest, but because he is in Caoshan, I didn't go." The reporter said, are you afraid of him? President Fu smiled again and said, how can I be afraid of him? Fu also told a joke: The day before yesterday, the American consul hosted a banquet, and he originally wanted to go, but later his wife said that Soong Tzu-wen might be invited, so he called to ask, and if Soong Tzu-wen was present, he would not go, but the American consul did not invite Soong. However, the American consul asked Fu, why don't you go if Soong is present? Fu said to the consul: "You are too ignorant of Chinese affairs."

### A Perspective on Smuggling Routes in Guangdong Province

[A Guangzhou Dispatch, 1st Day of the Month] The primary smuggling routes in Guangdong can be divided into sea and land routes. Although there is some smuggling by air, it is rare due to high costs and unsuitability for bulky goods.

Smuggling into the country by sea can be further categorized into several forms: (1) Consolidation of Small Quantities: A private smuggling company sends a large number of people to carry goods in small amounts on ships traveling between Hong Kong and the province back to Guangzhou. After arriving, they meet at a pre-arranged location to consolidate the goods for wholesale or delivery to local merchants. These smugglers typically have limited capital and struggle to establish leadership. They mainly deal in light goods such as Western medicine, gold, and flannel. (2) Fleeting Opportunity: This form is usually carried out by people working on ships traveling between Hong Kong and the province. It's quite aggressive, with ship personnel pooling funds. Sometimes, an entire hold is filled with smuggled goods. They exploit their familiarity and ease of concealment, making it relatively safe. Some established smugglers also engage in this by paying a substantial price to bribe the crew. If the crew is doing it themselves, they usually carry cigarettes, tires, or other easily sold items. (3) Power-Based: This type has a more robust scale, backing, and capital base. As such, their smuggling isn't particularly secretive. They likely use money or connections to bribe officials at each checkpoint in advance, then openly transport goods by ship directly from Hong Kong to the city, but not directly to Guangzhou. Instead, they unload near Guangzhou and transfer the goods by small boats. This type of organization often consists of disillusioned politicians and failed businessmen who have joined forces. Due to their behind-the-scenes connections, they are rarely discovered or apprehended. Insiders say this form of smuggling, while safe, has thin profit margins due to high expenses for greasing palms.

In addition to the above three types, there is also a forceful approach. These operations are based in towns near Hong Kong or Kowloon, such as Dongguan, Taiping, Shiqiao, and Shenzhen. These organizations are formed by powerful local figures with immense, often incalculable, capital. Each company owns dozens of high-speed boats equipped with powerful weapons. They smuggle by unloading cargo from Hong Kong on several nights of the month. If intercepted by customs ships, they either flee or concentrate the firepower of dozens of boats to resist. This type of smuggling is consistently considered the most feared by customs officials. Due to their substantial organization and capital, they smuggle anything that is profitable, meaning they import anything at all.

Land Smuggling

Besides the goods smuggled in by sea, some also enter by land.

(1) "Airplane" Style: People running on train rooftops or jumping off at stations. These people in groups of three to five, carrying small packages, are smugglers. Although seemingly independent, they each have a base of operations. They travel between Guangzhou and Hong Kong, mostly working for companies. Insiders call these smugglers "airplane kids." They are mostly employed by smuggling companies, though some work independently. These smuggling companies usually have limited capital.

(2) Profit-Sharing: Miners, lower-level service staff, and cooks on the Guangzhou-Kowloon train pool funds. Each time their train goes to Hong Kong, they take advantage of the opportunity to disembark, buy goods, board the train, and hide the items for transport back. Sometimes, they contact smugglers on the train to distribute the goods, and the profits are shared. The impact of this is limited.

(3) Mobile: This type of organization is quite large, but its headquarters has no fixed address, generally being located in the outskirts of Guangzhou or near Hong Kong and Kowloon. In addition to bribing officials, they are equipped with powerful weapons to protect smuggled goods. This approach is very aggressive, with truck convoys of eight to ten vehicles rushing from Kowloon directly into the mainland. According to insiders, this most often occurs at Man Kam To. They often pre-arrange entry times with customs, with officials leaving their posts at the agreed time, and the company paying the agreed-upon fee afterward.

Export Smuggling

In addition to importing smuggled goods, Guangzhou also has goods being smuggled out. While seemingly less prevalent, with the general perception being that only food is exported, the reality is more complex. Insiders point out that, besides food, items like homespun cloth and various sundries, including beans, are also exported.

The methods of export smuggling are not entirely the same as import smuggling, but there are few significant differences. Waterborne transport accounts for 80%, making it particularly prominent. According to insiders, the methods of export smuggling are very intricate. Most of the goods are first transported to towns and villages near Guangzhou, where they are stored for ten days to half a month before being smuggled out. Last year, the areas most favored by smugglers for assembling goods were near Huangzhuqi, Shiqiao, Dongguan Taiping, or Wanqingsha. This year, due to the economic downturn in various places, most businesses have closed down or restructured their routes. The prosperity of the southwest-to-Macau route is indicative of the changes in smuggling routes this year. Although precise figures for export and import smuggling last year are difficult to obtain, insiders estimate that no fewer than 30,000 people are involved in import smuggling, and 15,000 to 18,000 in export smuggling (these numbers are only for those active in the city). Adding those in the surrounding rural areas, the total number is believed to be as high as 100,000.

### The Dujiangyan Irrigation System: From Prevention to Improvement

— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Zhou Xueduan

[A Chengdu Dispatch, 28th Day of the Month] The Dujiangyan irrigation system, which has benefited the western Sichuan plain for over two thousand years, has faced repeated floods in western Sichuan in the past two years due to the failure of the weir. This has led to a reevaluation and increased attention to this great project. To observe the changes in the project over the past two years, the reporter made a special trip to Dujiangyan to attend the water release ceremony.

The Hub of Irrigation on the Chengdu Plain

From Chengdu to Guanxian, a vast plain of about one hundred li, this is the heart of the "Land of Abundance." Ditches and canals crisscross the landscape because the Chengdu Plain was formed by the alluvial fan of the Minjiang River. Dujiangyan is the hub of irrigation for the plain. More than two thousand years ago, Li Bing and his son dug away Mount Lidui and built Dujiangyan, dividing the river into inner and outer channels. They passed down maxims for water management. To this day, the entire Dujiangyan project includes: (1) The Hundred-Zhang Dike and Water-Splitting Dam, used to protect the banks and direct the water flow correctly. (2) The new Yuzui (Fish Mouth), serving as the intake for the inner river. (3) The Maca, regulating the water volume. (4) The Leveling Sluice, discharging excess water. (5) The Feisha Weir (Flying Sand Weir), preventing lateral breaches. (6) The Pingkou (Bottleneck), measuring the water level. The entire Dujiangyan dam, spanning over four li, remains in its original scale. Climbing to the Erlang Temple, the stone walls are engraved with the true secrets of Li Bing and his son for managing the weir, praising his instructions to future generations: "Deep pools are difficult, build weirs low... diligent repairs yearly, prevent disasters." As the salutes resound and incense smoke curls, the solemn atmosphere conveys the greatness of the predecessors' legacy. The Sichuan Water Resources Bureau, responsible for managing the water and presiding over the ceremony, has neglected "preventing disasters" and failed to conduct "diligent repairs yearly," leaving a deep sense that the grand plan still exists, the instructions are still there, and two thousand years of progress should make people feel infinitely ashamed when paying tribute to their predecessors.

Several Reforms in the History of the Project

Behind the Erlang Temple is a shrine to Ding Wen-cheng (Shi-zhen), who is worshipped together with Li Bing and his son during the annual memorial ceremony. Ding Baozhen left a very good impression on the people of Sichuan due to his contributions and achievements. He was the first reformer of the Dujiangyan project. During the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, Ding Baozhen, as Governor-General of Sichuan, studied the Dujiangyan water conservancy and deeply felt the suffering of the people from the annual repairs. Seeing the insecurity of the bamboo cage stone dikes, he replaced them with iron pillars and stone piers, incurring countless expenses over the years. Unfortunately, the project was destroyed by floods shortly after completion, resulting in a tragic failure. Ding's failure resulted in his "dismissal from office," but his visionary perspective and courageous reform efforts provided profound inspiration to future generations. Since the Republic of China, warlords have fought for power, and water conservancy funds have been diverted, causing major and minor repairs to be suspended. In recent years, the Dujiangyan dikes have frequently collapsed, and western Sichuan has repeatedly suffered from floods. Only then did the Water Resources Bureau have a thorough repair plan. Unfortunately, due to budget constraints, they can only proceed gradually. The Weir Works Department adopted a new method last year, replacing bamboo cages and stone dikes with cement. Last year, a 12-zhang-long (approximately 40 meters) cement project was built on the Feisha Weir, and another 10 zhang (approximately 33 meters) will be continued this year. It is estimated that the entire 80-zhang-long (approximately 267 meters) Feisha Weir will be completely renovated in five or six years. This is another aspect in which we are now ashamed of Ding Wencheng.

New Methods Used for Feisha Weir Repairs

After watching the opening ceremony, the leaders of the Weir Works Department led a tour of the entire weir and the new projects. According to the person in charge, the main project this year is the construction of a cement leveling sluice on the Feisha Weir, which is much stronger than the bamboo cage construction. Its function is to maintain the water volume without overflowing when the inner river's water level is low, and to drain water out when the inner river's water level is high, ensuring that the Feisha Weir will not be destroyed by floods again this year. As for the permanent plan, a large water gate will be built on Dujiangyan to regulate rainfall and cut off the Min River to replace the maca, combining the strengths of both Chinese and Western engineering to thoroughly improve Dujiangyan. But when will this plan succeed? No one can guarantee.

The people of western Sichuan have the most sincere reverence for Dujiangyan and Li Bing, the prefect who created this great project. At this year's opening of the weir, despite the provincial government's austerity measures and the absence of a large-scale event, there were still sixty to seventy thousand spectators from all directions. In particular, the devastating lessons of the floods in western Sichuan over the past two years have made people place even more enthusiastic hope on the repair and improvement of the future project. The reporter saw the rushing floodwaters of the Minjiang River, following the maca being cut down, surging and gushing, and the endless stream of people along the Cheng-Guan road joining the flow, further emphasizing that the prevention and improvement of the Dujiangyan project is truly urgent.
