### North Atlantic Treaty Announced: Declaration to Resist Any Aggression Against Europe or North America with Collective Armed Action

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] The State Department announced that the full text of the North Atlantic Treaty, consisting of 1,040 characters, will be published at 4:00 PM Standard Time on Friday (midnight on the same day Shanghai time). A total of twelve countries have been invited to come here to sign the treaty in early April.

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] The content of the North Atlantic Treaty was announced today in the capitals of the United States, Britain, France, Canada, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Norway. The eight participating countries (Iceland, Denmark, Portugal, and Italy are also expected to be invited) declared their determination to resist aggression in any location in Europe and North America with collective armed action, using armed forces if necessary to counter such aggression. The eight countries also agreed to consult with each other in the event of a threat to the territorial integrity, political independence, or security of any signatory country to devise countermeasures. The provisions for taking collective action to repel aggression are found in Article 5 of the treaty, which states that any attack and any measures taken as a result to restore or maintain the security of the North Atlantic area shall be reported to the United Nations Security Council. The signatory countries shall also organize a committee to implement the treaty, organized in such a way as to be able to convene quickly at any time. The treaty specifically states that its signing does not affect the responsibility of the United Nations Security Council for maintaining international security and peace. Article 8 of the treaty guarantees that existing international treaties, such as the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet treaties, will not be affected by the signing of the treaty. Article 1 of the treaty clearly states that the signatory countries may, with unanimous agreement, invite any other European country that can promote the principles of the treaty and contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area to join the treaty. The treaty shall enter into force upon the deposit of instruments of ratification with the Government of the United States by a majority of the signatory countries. Ten years after the treaty enters into force, it may be extended for another ten years by agreement of all signatory countries at the request of any signatory country. After twenty years of implementation, any signatory country may give one year's notice of withdrawal from the treaty. (The full text of the treaty is published on page 3.)

[United Press, Washington, 18th] The historic North Atlantic Treaty will unite Western anti-communist countries, rearm them, and defend against attacks from the Soviet Union or other sources. After the publication of the treaty, it will provoke renewed condemnation from Soviet and communist leaders around the world and heated discussions in Western countries. Once the treaty is signed, it will only need to be ratified by the parliaments of a majority of the signatory countries to be implemented. However, that majority of signatory countries must include the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. According to President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson, the North Atlantic Treaty is only one of the United States' four major diplomatic initiatives. The second step will be to submit a bill to the Senate requesting one billion dollars in military aid to Western Europe at the same time as the treaty is approved.

### On the Day of the Announcement of the North Atlantic Treaty, the Chinese Communist Party, in Coordination with Moscow, Broadcast Calls for Opposition to a New World War

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) radio broadcast a Xinhua News Agency editorial titled "Mobilize the Peaceful Forces of the World," strongly calling on the people of all China to actively participate in the actions of people in all countries to oppose the danger of a new war and calling on all people's organizations to elect representatives to attend the World Congress for the Defense of Peace in April to "smash the conspiracy of war provocateurs." The article criticized the United States for refusing to negotiate with the Soviet Union and rejecting proposals for disarmament and a ban on the use of atomic weapons. It also said that "American imperialism is our mortal enemy, and the Soviet Union is our comrade-in-arms. The Soviet Union was the first to abolish the unequal treaties of Tsarist Russia and provided practical assistance to China in its war against Japan. The Red Army crushed the elite Japanese Kwantung Army, prompting Japan to surrender." The decision on Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian (Dairen) in the Sino-Soviet Treaty is "a major blow to imperialism and a peaceful guarantee for the Chinese people." The CCP's broadcast on the day that the content of the European North Atlantic Treaty was announced has attracted much attention from various parties. It is generally believed that the CCP's issuance of an international call for peace at this time is clearly in coordination with the actions of the Third International headquarters in Moscow. According to international situation observers here, the North Atlantic Treaty will be formally signed in Washington on April 4. It is predicted that the democratic bloc of countries and the totalitarian communist forces will enter a new stage. In order to counterattack, the Soviet Union will inevitably call on its satellite countries to launch new offensives. In yesterday's Xinhua News Agency editorial, the CCP clearly accused "American imperialism of actively preparing for a new world war. All peace-loving people around the world must mobilize to oppose the danger of a new war. As long as all peace-loving forces around the world unite and struggle, the danger of war can be completely overcome." In the northeast and north China areas controlled by the CCP, actions against the United States, opposition to American aid to the Nationalist government, and accusations of MacArthur supporting Japan against the Soviet Union have become increasingly aggressive. According to reliable sources, the CCP has conducted a thorough review of the Pacific situation and plans to coordinate its military actions to cross the Yangtze River with the situation in Europe. It is said that CCP leaders close to Moscow are strongly advocating crossing the river, targeting Wuhan and Guangzhou as attack objectives, hoping to merge with communist forces in Southeast Asia, creating a red zone in the Western Pacific to confront the United States. Another faction of key communist figures believes that in order to complete the "Chinese Revolution," the heart of the Nationalist government in Nanjing and Shanghai should be the primary target of attack, with the aim of defeating the National Army and unifying China, thereby changing the Asian situation. It is generally believed that regardless of which decision the CCP takes, it is believed that the reorganization and retraining of the communist forces north of the Yangtze River will be completed by the end of this month at the latest, and that its offensive to cross the river will be launched in early April, echoing the tense situation in the Western Pacific. This kind of action has gradually attracted the attention of international figures. Yesterday, the CCP radio clearly and publicly introduced Stalin's two statements on January 30 and February 2 expressing his willingness to meet with US President Truman, and emphasized the statements of French Communist Party leader Maurice Thorez, Italian Communist Party leader Palmiro Togliatti, and communist parties in various countries against the danger of a new war, calling on the Chinese people to "undoubtedly strive to support the calls of the world's peaceful forces, and the Chinese people must actively participate in the ranks against a new war." It is said that the CCP will send representatives to participate in the World Congress for the Defense of Peace to be convened in April, "with the Chinese people's own beliefs," to cooperate with people around the world, believing that "American imperialism will definitely be defeated, and the danger of a new war will definitely be overcome."

[Report from this newspaper, Quzhou, 18th] Reports that Chen Yi went to Chongqing or Taiwan are incorrect. According to related sources, Chen is indeed still recuperating here, residing in a small Western-style house in the east of the city, and refusing to see guests. It is said that his subordinates, such as Zhou Yi'e, are accompanying him, and he does not take half a step out of the gate.

### Staff Forced to Suspend Pay and Work in Nanjing Push Representatives to Request Reinstatement: President He and the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan Send Representatives to Meet Them, Expressing Extreme Concern and Promising to Find a Solution

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The delegation of staff from various agencies in the capital who were forced to suspend pay and work petitioned the Legislative Yuan, the Supervisory Yuan, and the new President of the Executive Yuan, He Yingqin, on the 18th, demanding immediate reinstatement and compensation for the balance of the three months' salary that had already been prepaid at the current rate. President He sent staff officer Liu Shijin to meet with them, expressing extreme concern about the matter and stating that he would find a way to solve it as soon as he took office. The Legislative Yuan sent members Shao Jingren and Zou Shuwen to meet with them, promising to forward their demands to the general assembly. The Supervisory Yuan sent members Gu Fengxiang and Xiong Zaiwei to meet with them, promising to convey their demands to President He and find a solution when they meet with him in the afternoon.

### Supervisory Yuan Tea Party Hosts President He: Presents Seven Political Opinions, Hoping to Strengthen Reform, Progress, Unity, Establish Trustworthiness, Select Talent, Rectify Discipline, Punish Corruption Severely, and Promote Peace

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The opinions of all members of the Supervisory Yuan on the current political situation were presented to President He at the tea party hosted by Presidents Yu Youren and Liu Zhe of the two Yuan on the afternoon of the 18th. The focus was divided into seven points: (1) Strengthen the determination for reform, (2) Strengthen progress and unity, (3) Make careful decisions and establish government credibility, (4) Select talent, (5) Rectify discipline, (6) Enforce the rule of law and punish corruption severely, and (7) Promote peace. The tea party was held at the International Recreation Club at 4:00 PM. More than 90 Supervisory Yuan members participated. He arrived punctually at 4:00 PM, first shaking hands with each Supervisory Yuan member, then taking a seat. Presidents Yu and Liu successively stood up to speak, saying that President He was forming a cabinet, and the Supervisory Yuan was meeting at this time, bringing local situations to the central government, and the Supervisory Yuan members could also state the hopes of the various places for President He. Subsequently, Gu Fengxiang, Liu Pingjiang, Chen Yunge, and others made oral explanations on the seven opinions they put forward. Gu especially emphasized that the country is in extreme danger today. If President He does not resolutely reform at this time of crisis, today's crisis cannot be saved. Only through reform can it be revived. Unity and progress are even more necessary today, but the unity should be a progressive force, revolutionary people, rather than perfunctory dealing with factions. Gu also pointed out that in the past, due to unstable policies and constantly changing orders, public grievances were boiling. Liu Pingjiang proposed "Determine national policy, know people and be good at assigning them, clearly define powers and responsibilities, and reward and punish fairly" as the responsibility of the cabinet premier, hoping to implement new policies and use new people. Those with proven corruption in the past and those without political achievements should be rejected outside the cabinet door, and he especially pointed out that the choice of finance minister should be careful and that financial tycoons should not be used again, otherwise, it will definitely fail, and the past abandonment of discipline, the decay of military discipline and political ethics, must be rectified. Chen Yunge said that promoting peace has become a unanimous call throughout the country. Regardless of the reasons and needs for the war, in this situation where people across the country are separated from their wives and children, the people can no longer tolerate the war. Only by seeking peace can the needs of the people be met. Subsequently, Gesang Yueshi, Sun Yucong, Cao Dexuan, Qi Dapeng, and others spoke. Sun especially encouraged President He to have the determination and courage to reform, and the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan will resolutely support the progressive He cabinet. Cao Dexuan spoke passionately, saying that to rectify discipline, it is necessary to start by punishing Liu Zhi, the commander who lost the Battle of Xuzhou, and Wei Lihuang, who abandoned Shenyang without a fight. Sun Ke, the former President of the Executive Yuan, should also be punished. Cao also proposed that peace should have limits, support preparing for war while seeking peace, oppose ceasing war and begging for peace, firmly oppose the localized surrender-style peace, and advocate that war and peace should be decided by the National Assembly. The tea party ended at half-past five.

### Zhang Qun Returns to Chongqing Today

Chen Cheng and Zhu Shaoliang are still in Nanjing, Chen Jitang will go to Hainan in the next few days

[Report from this newspaper, Chongqing, 18th] Zhang Qun telegraphed that he has decided to fly back to Chongqing from Guangzhou on the 19th.

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Chen Cheng and Zhu Shaoliang continued to discuss official business in Nanjing on the 18th. He Yingqin, Yu Youren, and Gu Zhutong visited them.

[Report from this newspaper, Guangzhou, 18th] Chen Jitang flew from Nanjing to Guangzhou on the 18th. It is said that he will go to Hainan Island in the next few days to take up his new position and has announced Huang Linshu as Secretary-General. Chen firmly denied rumors that he would be reassigned as the Chairman of Guangdong.

### Executive Yuan Under-Secretary Meeting: Agreed on Transfer Procedures

### He Yingqin Discusses Forming a Cabinet at a Supervisory Yuan Reception

Says he is determined to strive for peace

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] President He Yingqin personally declared at the reception hosted by President Yu Youren and Vice President Liu Zhe of the Supervisory Yuan on the afternoon of the 18th that the new cabinet he organized is a peace cabinet. He is determined to strive for peace, improve people's lives, and seek national construction to increase the happiness of the people. Cabinet members are also being sought from all parties in accordance with this direction, and he is determined to follow the principle of selecting the virtuous and capable to recruit true talents. However, because the current situation is difficult, many virtuous and capable people are unwilling to enter the cabinet rashly, so it is still necessary to urge them in many ways, and the list of cabinet members cannot be announced early. He pointed out that the current situation is difficult and that we must work together to save the crisis and called on the Supervisory Yuan and Legislative Yuan members to provide more assistance and support to overcome the difficulties together and complete the mission. He said that accepting the mandate to form a cabinet was like jumping into a fire pit. Knowing it was a fire pit, why was he willing to jump? It was because he saw that the people were living in dire straits and suffering unspeakable hardships, and it was necessary to seek peace to save them. After Japan surrendered, he believed that war was cruel and immediately asked the government to send him to work at the Security Council to promote world peace. At that time, he lectured everywhere in the United States, advocating peace and believing that the world had already experienced two world wars, and there should be no more wars in the future. When he heard that the Political Consultative Conference was being held domestically to resolve domestic problems, he felt very excited. He also recounted his experience in forming the cabinet at the meeting, modestly saying that since he participated in the Xinhai Revolution in the first year of the Republic, he has always been engaged in military work and has little research on political work, and lacks experience and cadres. He repeatedly and firmly declined, but after Vice President Li sent Mr. Wu Liqing and others to persuade him many times, he reluctantly agreed to do his best, and everything was unprepared. Recently, he has been busy forming a cabinet, and he has not had time to draft policy guidelines. He will provide the suggestions of the Supervisory Yuan members to his future cabinet colleagues for common reference. He's attitude was sincere, and he won unanimous praise from the Supervisory Yuan members. After He spoke, President Yu Youren stood up and made a concluding speech, saying: "If he doesn't jump into the fire pit, who can jump into the fire pit? I believe Mr. He will surely guide me to take the bright path." The reception ended in warm applause.

### New Cabinet Personnel Difficult to Assemble: Ideal Candidates Still Modestly Declining in Various Ways, Full List May be Decided Tonight

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The work of organizing the new cabinet has obviously encountered great difficulties. Although He Yingqin has been working hard with great courage and perseverance, he has achieved little success. He Yingqin told reporters on the 18th that he had been inviting people from all over the country to join the cabinet, and had been making long-distance calls to Guangzhou and Shanghai for days, and his voice was almost hoarse. He also repeatedly said that there were many difficulties. He's ideal and goal is for cabinet members to be detached in position, rich in qualifications, and avoid using old people as much as possible. However, as of the 18th, almost nine out of ten of the people he invited had politely declined, so He had to change his consideration to new people. At the same time, the level of the people he was considering had to be gradually lowered. Political figures in Nanjing admire He's efforts in this kind of expectation, but they are all pessimists about his achievements. Currently, entering the cabinet has been seen by the general public as "jumping into a fire pit." If new people do not have the courage and determination to jump into the fire pit, they will inevitably turn to recruiting old bureaucrats, and the original ideals of the He cabinet will be greatly discounted. He's attitude towards people and things is extremely sincere, which can avoid the possible criticism he may encounter due to the slow formation of the cabinet. He still meets with Vice President Li every day to report and discuss personnel issues. He went to visit him at 3:00 PM on the 18th and talked for an hour before leaving.

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] According to extremely reliable sources, the list of the new cabinet had not been finalized as of the evening of the 18th. Although the personnel reported in the newspapers these days have their basis, most of them are still in the process of being contacted. The source revealed that if there are no unexpected changes, the full list is expected to be finalized on the evening of the 19th. However, the announcement may be on the 21st, because the Vice President who is a member of the Kuomintang must be approved by the Central Standing Committee, and the heads of ministries and commissions must be approved by the Central Political Committee.

[Report from this newspaper] It has not yet been decided whether the Democratic Socialist Party will participate in the new cabinet. The party held a Central Standing Committee meeting in Shanghai yesterday. Zhang Junmai was absent due to illness. Because of the disagreement within the meeting, no conclusion was reached, and it was decided to compile the various viewpoints and send them to Chairman Zhang Junmai for decision. Jiang Yuntian will also go to Nanjing today, and Xu Chuanlin can fly from Guangzhou to Shanghai today. Furthermore, the Standing Committee of the China Youth Party resolved yesterday not to participate in the He cabinet, but to do its best to support it, and the party's Propaganda Minister Wang Shizeng issued a written statement on this.

### Fierce Fighting in Bawu and Hongxi: Gunfire Can Be Heard in Cheng Yi

[Report from this newspaper, Jiangyin, 18th] The Kuomintang and Communist armies fought fiercely for an hour five miles west of Bawu Port on the morning of the 18th. The Communist army retreated. Gunfire could be heard in Cheng Yi, and the people were still at peace.

[Report from this newspaper, Zhenjiang, 18th] There was no major contact on the front line of Shi Jiaqiao and Sanwen River in Zhenjiang in recent days. On the morning of the 18th, the Communist army fired six shells at the National Army positions with two mortars.

### Communist Army in Henan Moves Southward Step by Step: Threat to the Southern Section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Increases Daily: Zhengyang and Luoshan Two Dead Spots Have Been Abandoned

[Report from this newspaper, Hankou, 18th] The Communist army in southeastern Henan province is moving southward step by step, and the threat to the southern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway is increasing daily. The line from Wusheng Pass, Guangshui, to Huayuan has been reinforced by the military with elite troops. A small number of refugees, unaware of the real situation, continue to flee here.

[Report from this newspaper, Xinyang, 18th] The Chen Yi troops and the 3rd and 4th Army Groups, which are assembled in the border area of Henan and Hubei, are estimated by the military to have a main force of about three armies, and another three armies are continuously moving south from the Qu River and Xin Cai. It is also learned that two regiments of the 13th Army of the 4th Army Group, which arrived between Guangshan and Xi County on the 16th, are still circling in the Zhou Jiuban area east of Wusheng Pass.

[Report from this newspaper, Xinyang, 18th] After the National Army in southern Henan abandoned the strategically unnecessary dead spots of Zhiyang and Luoshan, the four elite troops originally stationed in these two counties have been concentrated on the periphery of Xinyang. Also, the Henan Provincial Government is still working in Jiashengwan (42 kilometers from Hankou).

[Reuters, Nanjing, 18th] Xinhua Radio in northern Shaanxi announced that the People's Liberation Army had occupied Macheng, about eighty miles northeast of Hankou, and the Kuomintang army was retreating south. This southward movement of the Communist army is to cooperate with Chen Yi's troops in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to begin crossing the river when peace talks break down.

### Communist Army Attempts to Flee to Sichuan: Shaanxi Recovers Tongchuan and Pucheng

### Embezzling 110 Million Yuan of National Funds: Censure of Sun Ke Established: Supervisory Yuan Members Request Severe Punishment and Prosecution

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The Supervisory Yuan members Ni Bi, He Jizhou, Yu Peihou, and others filed a censure case against Sun Ke, the former President of the Executive Yuan, for withdrawing 110 million yuan from the Central Bank in the name of confidential funds. The investigation has been established. The full cause, facts, and reasons are as follows:

Cause: President of the Executive Yuan Sun Ke recklessly spent a huge amount of national funds, turning public funds into private funds. It is urgently necessary to request the President to severely punish him, immediately recover all public funds, and send him to the judicial authorities for prosecution in accordance with the law in order to demonstrate the law and discipline and rectify political conduct.

Facts and Reasons:

The Central Bank received a secret letter from Finance Minister Xu Kan on February 15 of this year, stating: "According to the order of President Sun of the Executive Yuan on February 10: 'Immediately allocate 110 million yuan for the President's confidential funds to meet urgent needs, etc.', it should be obeyed. Accordingly, I am writing to request your bank to allocate the amount as requested. "On the same day, Luo Zongwen, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, issued a temporary receipt and obtained a promissory note No. 7516 worth 100 million yuan and a promissory note No. 75A worth 10 million yuan from the Central Bank. On the same day, the confidential fund of 110 million yuan was collected in full. The next day, February 16, the Bank of China presented the 100 million yuan promissory note for exchange and transferred it to the Sun Zhiping account (Sun Ke's son, China Industrial Bank official shareholder Huang) No. 52378 of the bank's current deposit account. On the same day, 14 checks were used to withdraw a total of 80,019,000 yuan. Among them, four transfers were made to Yongcheng account No. 53110, totaling 44 million yuan. One transfer was made by Huamao Bank for 1 million yuan. Nine cash payments were made, totaling 35,190,000 yuan. The deposits in the Yongcheng account were used to issue 15 checks on the same day, totaling 44,039,200 yuan, all of which were private financial enterprises. The Bank of China also spent 22,016,404.6 yuan on February 17 with five checks, totaling 102,220,064.6 yuan with 19 checks in two days. Another 10 million yuan promissory note from the Central Bank was also transferred to Zhao Jihao account No. 3408 of Anyu Qianzhuang (the number is for the Yuanchun stock exchange) on February 16 and was presented on the same day, and separately entered the Chongqing, Chunmao, Silk, Shengda, Hengda Banks and firms application forms, and Fuhua Tobacco Company, Xinfuji Food Shop and other accounts. Based on the above circumstances, it can be concluded that Sun Ke, by virtue of his position, recklessly used the name of confidential funds to secretly withdraw a huge amount of national funds from the National Action, turning public funds into private funds. The facts have become clear. At this time, when the foundation of the country is shaking and the people's livelihood is declining, and the general public and teaching staff are wandering around and calling out in the streets, Sun Ke, as the head of the government, brazenly disregarded everything and recklessly spent a huge amount of national funds, turning public funds into private funds, which is a great shame for all public and teaching staff across the country. It should be requested that the President severely punish him and immediately recover all public funds. His crimes of corruption and dereliction of duty should be handed over to the judicial authorities for prosecution in accordance with the law in order to demonstrate the law and discipline and rectify political conduct.

### Chongqing Warship Sails in the Bohai Sea: Its Actions Cannot Escape Naval Headquarters' Control; If It Doesn't Return, It Will Eventually Be Bombed and Sunk

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The cruiser Chongqing is within the control range of the Naval Headquarters. Whether to bomb and sink it will be revealed in a few days. The location that can currently be disclosed is neither in Port Arthur (Lushun), controlled by the Soviet Union, nor in Dalian. This matter is sufficient to demonstrate that the Soviet Union does not want to cooperate regarding any trace of connection with the Chinese Communists. Therefore, the Chinese Communists had a surprised reaction of being at a loss after accepting this massive rebel ship. Their handling also fell into a state of panic and inability. They desperately wanted to take it in, yet feared that officers and soldiers within the original crew who did not agree with the rebellion would sail the ship to the government-controlled area. During the several days in Yantai Port, a portion of the Shandong sailors voluntarily returned to their hometowns, going to Huangxian and Longkou. Subsequently, the Communist army decided to send around 300 elite Communist soldiers to board the ship to assist, sailing it northward away from Yantai. The final fate of the ship will likely be like that of the Huang An, but before it sinks, the Naval Headquarters is still exerting its utmost to call it back via radio waves, attempting to summon this trump card.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The destroyer Huang An was a small ship of 1,000 tons. After it defected from Qingdao on February 12th, its whereabouts could not be ascertained. Subsequently, on March 14th, the Air Force dispatched transport planes carrying the ship's captain, Liu Guangchao, and others to patrol the east coast. They discovered this gray small ship outside Lianyungang. On the same day, the first batch of planes that went to drop bombs deliberately dropped bombs around the ship, forcing the ship to obey and listen to orders to return south. Unexpectedly, the ship's personnel, fearing punishment upon returning south, sailed the ship into the southern dock of Lianyungang and docked it after the planes left. The personnel then landed and fled. At this point, the Air Force knew that guiding the ship back south was hopeless, so on the 15th, they dispatched planes to bomb in shifts, hitting the deck on the ship's starboard side and the stern smokestack, causing the ship to tilt and partially sink. According to reports, only two naval ships defected: the Huang An and the Chongqing. The foreign reports of seven ships are inaccurate.

### Indian Ambassador Recalled to His Country

[Reuters Nanjing, 18th] It is learned that the Indian Ambassador to China, Panikkar, has been summoned by the Indian government to discuss the Chinese situation. Mr. Panikkar is scheduled to depart for his country on the 23rd and return to his post in approximately three weeks.

### Hong Lanyou's Statement Regarding the Lan Ni Case: Declares He Did Not Intercede on Her Behalf

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Interior Minister Hong Lanyou, since resigning along with Premier Sun Ke's cabinet, went to Shanghai to continue treating his chronic stomach ailment. A reporter recently visited to inquire about the recent impeachment by the Control Yuan regarding the Lan Ni dye case involving a letter from Hong to the late Director Wu Ren Cang. Hong stated that this matter was long before a year ago, and he had almost forgotten it had it not been brought up again. Recalling the time he wrote the letter, it was purely to urge the legal handling of the matter, and in terms of the tone of the original letter, words such as "examine and handle" and "decide" in fact did not imply any intention to intercede on her behalf.

### Editorial: Starting with the Atlantic Pact

The Atlantic Pact, which has been brewing for a long time, has been scheduled to be signed in Washington next month on the 4th. The eight countries that initiated the pact, namely, Britain, the United States, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, and Canada, have jointly invited Denmark, Iceland, Portugal, and Italy to participate in the signing ceremony. It goes without saying that the enthusiastic invitation of Denmark, Iceland, and Portugal is without a doubt, and even Italy has overcome the obstruction of the Italian Communists and decided to send representatives to Washington as scheduled. Although this Atlantic Pact is regional in nature, no one can deny the depth and breadth of its implications.

Standing from a third-party perspective, observing the content and function of this pact, one cannot help but say that it is a major achievement for Britain and the United States in the Cold War against the Soviet Union. It is expected that after the signing of the Atlantic Pact, other regional security pacts will be born one after another. The Mediterranean Joint Defense Pact sought by Turkey and the Pacific Pact or Southeast Asian League advocated by Britain have the potential to become a reality. However, Britain and the United States are advancing step by step in diplomacy, aggressively pressing forward, which will inevitably cause a serious reaction from the Soviet Union and deepen the deterioration of the world crisis.

The United Press reported from London on the 16th: Europe is suffering from a very heavy war phobia, and everyone has a feeling that a Soviet diplomatic crisis is forming. This abstract report, although inevitably has the suspicion of "alarmism," but it is not entirely groundless talk. We have synthesized recent international developments and can list the following facts to prove the accuracy of this statement. First, the five Western European countries (Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg) have established a general defense plan, on the one hand, the five Western European countries are accelerating the reorganization of their armed forces, and on the other hand, they are asking the United States to supply weapons. Among them, Britain's active expansion of its air force is particularly noticeable. Second, Bulgaria and Hungary, with the tacit approval of the Soviet Union, disregard the military provisions in the peace treaties with Bulgaria and Hungary, and actively expand their armies; the existing army of Romania has also exceeded the limits stipulated in the treaty. Third, Iran will abandon the Soviet-Iranian treaty of 1921 and will form a military alliance with the United States, determined to coexist and die with Western countries. Fourth, the Turkish parliament also unanimously supports its Foreign Minister Sadak's pro-British and pro-American policy, and Foreign Minister Sadak plans to go to Washington in the near future to discuss the Mediterranean Joint Defense Pact with the American government and people.

The above facts all show the seriousness of today's world situation. The people of all countries in the world, after suffering the devastation of the first and second world wars, unanimously seek peace and yearn for stability, but the objective facts seem to be running counter to this common wish of mankind, moving further away from peace and closer to war step by step. From the perspective of Western countries, whether it is the formation of the Western European Union, the signing of the Atlantic Pact, or the conclusion of the Mediterranean Joint Defense Pact, they are all self-defense plans to ensure regional peace and security, and are limited to self-preservation only, without any aggressive nature targeting other countries. However, in today's world where bipolarization is becoming increasingly clear, the various arrangements made by Western countries in Europe, the Near East, and the Mediterranean, from another perspective, are nothing less than a thorn in the side. They either try to break the arrangements made by Western countries in various places, or they want to make an arrangement in other places to offset the effect of the other party's arrangements. I remember that when the Norwegian authorities were considering whether to jointly launch the Atlantic Pact with Western countries, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov suggested to Norway that they conclude a treaty of non-aggression between the Soviet Union and Norway; and when the Italian authorities were studying whether to accept the invitation of Western countries to participate in the Atlantic Pact, the Italian Communist Party, under the instructions of the New Communist International, strongly obstructed it; and as Western countries were creating a favorable situation in Europe, the Soviet Union was actively creating a favorable situation for itself in Asia. All of these are sufficient to illustrate that today's world is under the struggle of two forces. If they can be evenly matched and create a balance of power, then world peace may still be able to linger and maintain for a period of time; conversely, if it loses its balance, then the international war that will be a disaster for mankind will be difficult to avoid and is even closer at hand.

From this perspective, the signing of the Atlantic Pact can be said to be a major arrangement for Britain and the United States in diplomacy, creating an absolutely favorable situation internationally; but things in the world often change when they reach the limit. If the Soviet Union is pushed to the end of the road, then there is a possibility of major changes in the international arena. It is not necessary to talk about the distant future, let's look at the near future. What has Asia become today? The capital of Myanmar has become an isolated city and is in imminent danger. If Britain and India cannot provide effective assistance, Myanmar will probably also change color. Other countries such as Malaysia, Siam, and Vietnam are also facing the same crisis. British and American diplomats may think of the signing of the Atlantic Pact as a diplomatic victory, and are smug about it, but they do not know that under the erroneous policies of the United States emphasizing Europe over Asia and ignoring the nature of the war in China, starting from the victory of the Chinese Communist army, the crisis in Asia has been deepening day by day, and this is the bad result caused by the British and Americans being busy making arrangements in Europe. We hope that British and American diplomats will face reality, have a long-term vision, look at the whole world, and quickly seek countermeasures to fill this huge gap in Asia. Otherwise, they will suffer the consequences and regret it too late!

### Legislators Propose to Suspend the Application of the Provisional Provisions During the Period of National Mobilization for the Suppression of Communist Rebellion; After Heated Discussion, It Is Referred to Review

Sixth Meeting of the Legislative Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The sixth meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan was held on the morning of the 18th. It started at 9:15 a.m., with 182 members present and Tong Guanxian as chairman. After reporting on agenda items, the two issues proposed by the Program Committee were discussed. One was how the various committees of the Legislative Yuan should be reorganized. Many members spoke, and it was finally decided to first study and amend Article 3 of the Legislative Yuan's Organic Law, in coordination with the plan to simplify administrative agencies, which was the responsibility of the Legal System Committee, and to submit it to the Yuan for discussion within a week. The other was the draft Temporary Property Tax Regulations, which was decided to be referred to the Finance and Economy Committee for review. Secretary-General Chen Kewen read a telegram from Jiao Ciling Hongxun, stating that Minister Yu had requested leave, and Deputy Minister Ling was handling the handover in Guangdong. Regarding the inquiry on the price increase of railways, post, and telecommunications, Zhao ChuanYun, Assistant to the Director of the Road Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, Xue PinWen, Director of Postal Affairs, and Ji ShunTing, Director of the Telecommunications Bureau, were present at the meeting to explain. The members believed that those who reported to the parliament should be the ministers and deputy ministers, and other staff members could not be sent to handle it casually. This precedent could not be set and was unanimously rejected. Then, the discussion began on the proposal by Jin Shaoxian and others to request the Yuan to resolve and advise the President to declare the end of the period of national mobilization for the suppression of Communist rebellion in accordance with the law, and to immediately suspend the application of the provisional provisions during the period of national mobilization for the suppression of Communist rebellion. The members spoke one after another, and no conclusion was reached until noon. The meeting was adjourned at 12:00 noon. The meeting continued at 4:00 p.m., with 163 members present. Shao Jingren reported on the situation of receiving public servants who petitioned for reinstatement. The discussion on suspending the application of the provisional provisions during the period of national mobilization for the suppression of Communist rebellion continued until 5:30 p.m. before it was passed and referred to review. It was also decided that the 17 members who spoke and requested to speak today would be responsible for the review, with Xiao Juetian as the convener, and other members could participate freely. Afterwards, three more proposals were passed: (1) The proposal by Yang Yifeng and others to quickly and reasonably adjust the treatment of public school teachers nationwide was reviewed by the Western members of the Budget Committee and three members of the Finance and Economy Committee, with the members of the Budget Committee as the convener, and other members were free to participate, and a report was to be submitted to the Yuan within a week. (2) The proposal by Huang Tong and others to launch gold-priced deposits to stabilize finance, improve salary payment methods, protect savings, and unite the hearts of the military and civilians was referred to the Finance and Economy Committee for review. (3) The proposal by Wang Guangzhouqing and others to request the government to quickly determine a military reorganization plan, reduce the number of troops, tighten expenditures, verify salary payments, and reduce non-combat personnel as much as possible to save national funds was reviewed by five members each from the National Defense Committee, the Finance and Economy Committee, and the Budget Committee, with the National Defense Committee as the convener, and other members were free to participate, and a report was to be submitted to the Yuan within a week. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 p.m.

Li Shijun and Others Propose to Investigate National Property

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Legislator Li Shijun and others recently submitted a proposal to clarify the gold, silver, and foreign exchange payment situation of the national treasury, the number of currency issued, the actual situation of the use of US aid, as well as the handling of lend-lease materials, surplus materials, relief materials, and enemy and puppet property, as well as the current value, the capital of national investment enterprises, and the operation situation. It is proposed that the Yuan resolve and advise the Executive Yuan to quickly organize a national property investigation agency, divide into groups to thoroughly investigate, in order to rectify national finance and finance, and the Yuan will organize a special committee to study national property to discuss the above-mentioned events. The proposal pointed out that supervising national finance and controlling the national budget are important responsibilities entrusted to the Legislative Yuan by the Constitution. However, in the current situation, the budget is like a mere formality, and the effectiveness of laws and regulations is questionable. In order to get to the root of the problem, the existing national property should be thoroughly investigated first. At the same time, expenses that are not based on law should be removed and handled in accordance with the law, and those responsible for managing and operating national property who are found to be disloyal to their duties and cause losses to the country should be punished in accordance with the law, in order to stabilize the foundation of national finance and finance and to win people's hearts. In the method, it is also explained that the Executive Yuan should be consulted on the scope of national property investigation, paying special attention to: (1) The source of the national treasury's gold, silver, and foreign exchange income and expenditure, the situation of use, and the legal basis, the existing quantity level and location, and special attention should be paid to the central bank's sales and redemption details in recent years. (2) The number of currency issued, the situation of use, and the legal basis. (3) The capital and use of national banks. (4) The number of materials, value, and how they were used in the Lend-Lease Act, and the situation of entry and transfer. (5) The number and value of surplus materials allocated by the US military, how they were used, the existing number, and the situation of entry and transfer. (6) The number, value, and how they were used of relief materials, and how they were entered and transferred. (7) The number, value, and handling situation of enemy and puppet property received, with special attention to the investigation of warehouse materials, products, and factory property, how they are currently used, and the use and handling situation of enemy property materials received by military agencies. (8) The number and use of various domestic and foreign donations over the years. (9) Investigate national investment enterprises and loan enterprises, such as China Industrial Bank, Siming Bank, Commercial Bank, Guohuo Bank, and various enterprise organizations of China Textile Company, etc.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Program Committee of the Legislative Yuan held a meeting at 6:00 p.m. on the 18th to discuss the agenda for the seventh Yuan meeting on the 22nd.

### Yuanling is Full of Wounds: Nine Out of Ten Homes are Empty and It Will Be Difficult to Restore Within Ten Years; The People Still Have Lingering Fears About the Burning and Looting

[Our Yuanling Dispatch, 18th] The reporter arrived in Yuanling at dusk on the 17th and entered the city by crossing the river from the wharf. The urban area has undergone a catastrophe and is a desolate sight. Scorched wood and dilapidated walls are everywhere. None of the shops and doors are complete. They have been looted more than ten or twenty times. It has now been a week since the bandits retreated, but only a few restaurants and hotels have opened their doors. The citizens are weeping on the roadside. They still have lingering fears about the burning and looting that lasted for ten days. On the 16th, the corpses of three raped women were found in a bunker in the western suburbs, and they had not been buried by the evening of the 17th. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Yuanling became the political center of Hunan Province, with prosperous commerce. It was slightly inferior to the past after the victory, but it was still the largest city in western Hunan. This catastrophe has resulted in nine out of ten homes being empty, and it is difficult to hope for restoration within ten years. What the people of Yuanling are thinking about today is revenge. The county has more than 5,000 civilian guns and is brewing self-defense. There is a great feeling of lying in wait and biding their time, and the hatred between Yuan (ling) and Yong (shun) will probably never be resolved.

### Shortage of Raw Materials and Insufficient Power: The Textile Industry Faces a Crisis: Wu Weijing Speaks Before Leaving Hankou for Hunan

[This newspaper's Hankou dispatch, 17th] Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Corporation, recently came to Hankou to inspect the situation and transferred to Hunan for official business on the afternoon of the 17th. According to Wu's remarks before his departure: The Chinese textile industry is facing a serious crisis, the biggest reason being the shortage of raw materials and insufficient power. Based on the current cotton reserves in various factories, there is a shortfall of at least four months' worth of usage before the new cotton crop is available. Once the supply of raw materials is interrupted, it will not only indirectly affect the clothing of the military and civilians nationwide, but it will also directly plunge more than 700,000 employees engaged in the cotton textile industry in Shanghai into dire straits. He earnestly hopes that the military and political authorities in cotton-producing areas will cherish resources and encourage transportation and sales, in order to overcome the difficulties together. He also hopes that both the Nationalists and Communists will consider the hardships of the people and the difficulties of industrial construction, and not allow the remaining cotton-producing areas of Shaanxi and Hubei to suffer the disaster of war again.

### If Peace of Signatory Nations is Seriously Threatened: The United States Decides to Take Strong Action: After the Contents of the Atlantic Pact are Announced: Secretary of State Acheson Expresses a Stern Position

[This newspaper dispatch] Washington, 18th: Acheson recently explained his views on the North Atlantic Treaty at a press conference, stating that if the Western European countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty are attacked, the United States will immediately join the war. He emphasized that, according to the treaty, the extent to which the United States should fulfill its obligations under the treaty should still be determined by the United States Congress. Acheson stated that if the signatory countries encounter a full-scale attack, such as what France encountered in 1914 and 1940, each signatory country should, based on its sincere judgment, decide what necessary steps should be taken to restore peace and security. Acheson stated that if the countries determine that the use of force is necessary, then this is also an obligation of the treaty. Acheson also stated that, according to the treaty, the United States is legally obligated to do certain things. Although no one can force the United States to take any action, he is confident that the United States will fulfill the promises in the treaty it has signed. Acheson also clearly pointed out the difference between attacks on signatory countries and so-called border incidents, and gave the example that "we would never use a sledgehammer to kill a fly." Therefore, when Japan sank the Panay gunboat, the United States did not take action, but when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the United States took strong action. He stated that "we cannot predict the degree of importance of an event before it occurs, but strong action must only be taken when an attack has indeed threatened the peace and security of the signatory country being attacked." He believes that a purely domestic revolution cannot be considered an armed attack, but the situation is different if such a revolution is assisted by external forces. However, according to Article 4 of the treaty, if any signatory country believes that its political independence and security are threatened, the only obligation of the other signatory countries is to immediately hold consultations, not necessarily take action. Acheson also stated in response to questions that he believes that if aircraft transporting supplies to Berlin are attacked while passing through the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin, it should be regarded as an armed attack as referred to in this treaty. In his judgment, this action would be an attack on the occupying forces of the signatory countries.

Acheson also stated that if an attack occurs in an area outside the area designated by this treaty, and the signatory country is affected, the signatory countries should conduct consultations in accordance with the provisions of Article 4. However, the actions stipulated in Article 5 (including military assistance) do not apply to areas outside the area designated by this treaty.

[This newspaper dispatch] Washington, 18th broadcast: Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that the North Atlantic Treaty will be quickly approved by the Senate. Connally also stated that "quickly" means after the Senate has thoroughly listened to reports and debates. Connally stated: "The purpose of our participation in the North Atlantic Treaty is to seek peace and to resolve all international disputes through peaceful and legal means, without resorting to war. Now that the contents of the treaty can be published early, the people can understand its provisions before the Senate takes any action." Vandenberg and other members of the committee stated that they need to conduct a detailed study before making any comments. Representative Kee, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, stated that he believes the content is not strong enough. He believes that the treaty has placed a moral responsibility on the countries, but he himself hopes for a truly binding responsibility. Another member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Mansfield, stated that the treaty could bring about some changes in the United Nations organization, making it an organization with the power to achieve world peace. Representative Fulton, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, believes that the treaty places too much emphasis on military aspects and too little on economic and social aspects, and expressed concern about the funds required for the treaty.

### Signatory Nations of the Atlantic Pact: Will Establish a Defense Committee: To Specifically Study Various Measures of Military Mutual Assistance

[Reuters, London, 18th] The most practical measure of the Atlantic Pact is the establishment of a defense committee. In fact, the core organization of this committee already exists, namely the U.S.-British-Canadian Joint Staff located in Washington, the U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Board established before the United States entered World War II, and the permanent military organization of the Western European Union established under the Brussels Treaty.

After the tasks of these three organizations are combined, the Defense Committee of the Atlantic Pact is expected to be established at the time of the signing of the treaty, so that the order can start working after the treaty has been approved by the countries. Its immediate tasks are nothing more than: (1) determining the total military strength of the countries in the Atlantic Pact; (2) the portion that each country should bear in this total military strength and the assistance that the United States should provide; (3) how to allow new participating countries to join the Defense Committee; (4) how each country fulfills the legislative procedures to implement the aforementioned measures. In addition, the major issues that the Atlantic Pact will cause include the status of West Germany, Austria, and Trieste (because the signatory countries have occupying forces in those locations) and the issue of one of the signatory countries borrowing bases within the signatory countries. What is of most concern to the general public is the Soviet Union's reaction to the treaty. Some people predict that the Soviet Union will use the gap between the announcement and the signing to launch a surprising political counteroffensive. The announcement of the Eastern European Defense Pact can be regarded as one of its countermeasures.

### On the Atlantic Pact: Truman Agrees; Lie Expresses His Views

[This newspaper dispatch] Washington, 18th broadcast: President Truman stated in Key West, where he is on vacation, that he "fully agrees" with the North Atlantic Treaty.

[This newspaper dispatch] New York, 18th broadcast: Key West, Florida dispatch: Truman stated at a press conference that although Southern Democrats and other party members have expressed their opposition to him, he still hopes that most of his policies will receive the support of Congress. Truman stated: "The recent situation in Congress shows that the United States seems to be divided into three parties as it was during the presidential election last fall. These three parties are the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and the Southern Democratic Party." Truman's words indicate that he does not seem to regard the Southern Democratic Party as a true Democratic Party, but as another party.

[This newspaper dispatch] New York, 18th broadcast: Lake Success dispatch: United Nations Secretary-General Lie indirectly expressed his approval of the North Atlantic Treaty at a press conference. He refused to directly express his opinion, but stated that he had received the final draft of the treaty two days ago. When a reporter asked him if he thought the treaty was necessary to maintain world peace, he replied, "The United Nations does not have an agency to maintain peace, and there is no United Nations force or army under the Security Council, but we do have a strong moral force. No fewer than thirteen incidents have been promoted to peace, including the Palestine and Kashmir incidents. Although the solutions cannot be considered completely satisfactory, each problem has been achieved to avoid war."

### France's View

[This newspaper dispatch] Paris, 18th broadcast: A French Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated that the signing of the Atlantic Pact demonstrates the unity of nations within the United Nations that have the same cultural system and the same respect for human rights and love for freedom. Regarding the opposition of the Communist Party to this treaty, he replied, "This treaty is only aimed at aggressors. It is actually a defensive and peaceful treaty, which is indispensable in human history. If Hitler had known for sure in 1939 that the United States would eventually join the war, he probably would not have rashly launched the last world war."

### Bevin Explains the Atlantic Pact: Purely of a Defensive Nature: Says it Opens the Door to International Cooperation: Does Not Conflict with the Treaty Between England and the Soviet Union

[This newspaper dispatch] London, 18th broadcast: British Foreign Secretary Bevin declared in the House of Commons this afternoon to cheers that the North Atlantic Treaty is an important step towards peace and security. Bevin said, "I am surprised that the facts are a historic event. I am not exaggerating when I say this. This treaty has really opened a new era of cooperation and mutual understanding. There are no secret clauses in this treaty, nor is there anything that could threaten the security and well-being of any country.

This treaty is a purely defensive action taken by the signatory countries for the sake of security. Any country that does not have aggressive intentions has no need to fear this treaty. It would be great if the United Nations organization could provide security and collective defense for all countries, but unfortunately, this is not the case so far, so this treaty is really necessary." Bevin also assured the dominions that we have always been concerned about the interests of the dominions when discussing this treaty. Of course we are concerned about their safety.

[This newspaper dispatch] London, 18th broadcast: A government spokesperson stated that the United Kingdom will approve the United Kingdom's participation in the Atlantic Pact by an overwhelming majority. It is expected that only two Communist Party members and a few sympathizers will vote against it in the House of Commons. He said that the Atlantic Pact does not hinder the effectiveness of the British-Soviet treaty guaranteeing post-war cooperation, and emphasized that the treaty applies to the Arctic territories of Canada, Denmark and Norway. He also said that the West has troops stationed in Trieste, so Trieste will also be protected by the Atlantic Pact. Also, if Soviet Union attacks Berlin airlift planes, this treaty will also apply.

### Belgian Prime Minister Expresses

[Reuters, Brussels, 17th] Belgian Prime Minister Spaak emphasized the peaceful and defensive nature of the treaty when he announced the contents of the Atlantic Pact to a closed-door meeting of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee today.

### Finland Under Soviet Pressure: Forms Coalition Government

Will invite Communists to participate

[Reuters, Helsinki, 17th] Reliable sources say that Finnish Prime Minister Fagerholm has decided to reorganize his Social Democratic government into a coalition government, inviting Communist personnel to participate in minor departments of the cabinet. Although Fagerholm's decision has not been officially announced, it was first rumored that the Soviet Union intended to ask Finland for a base to balance Norway's action of joining the Atlantic Pact.

### Italian Parliament Authorizes Government: To Participate in the Atlantic Pact: Communist Party's Delaying Tactics Ultimately Fail

[This newspaper dispatch] London, 18th broadcast: Rome dispatch: After a 48-hour delaying debate amidst unanimous criticism from Communist Party members, the Italian Parliament finally passed a vote of 343 to 170 authorizing the government to participate in the Atlantic Pact, putting Italy on the same front as Western countries. Thus, the Italian Communist Party's struggle against the Atlantic Pact failed.

[Reuters, Rome, 18th] The debate in the Italian House of Representatives on the Atlantic Pact has continued for 50 hours as of noon today and has not yet ended. However, many members have already shown signs of exhaustion, and have fallen asleep at their desks or leaned back in their chairs. At dawn, the total number of members in the hall was only about 50. Communist Party members have stated that they are determined to adopt various delaying measures to postpone the vote on the Atlantic Pact until after the contents of the treaty are announced. At lunchtime today, Prime Minister Gasperi almost collapsed, but he still stated that he would not leave the field until the vote was taken. He also declared that he would regard this vote as a vote of confidence in the government. Togliatti, the leader of the Communist Party who stood in opposition to him, also said that he would not give up until he achieved his goal, despite his eyes being bloodshot. In total, by noon, about 140 Communist and left-wing Socialist members had spoken, averaging five speakers per hour, and 54 people were scheduled to speak in the afternoon. At the same time, outside the parliament, military and police throughout the country intensified their vigilance to prevent incidents. Minor disturbances have occurred in Florence, Bari, Parma, and Naples. The Communist Party also plans to hold a large demonstration in Milan tonight.

### U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey: Has Not Yet Completed Its Mission

Truman submits report to Congress

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] President Truman today submitted the sixth quarterly report to Congress on U.S. military aid to Greece and Turkey. It pointed out that the setbacks temporarily suffered by the Communist Party in the Greek civil war did not mean that the government forces could easily win. The work of training and equipping the Greek government forces has been quite successful, but there are still many unfulfilled tasks. Regarding aid to Turkey, the current focus is on helping Turkey strengthen its armed forces with equipment, materials, and technical assistance. However, so far, the equipment and supplies of the Turkish army have not yet reached a perfect state.

### Greece Recognizes Israel

[Reuters, Athens, 17th] The Greek government announced that it recognized Israel on the 17th.

### U.S. Principles for Aid to Western Europe: Economy Will Precede Military Affairs: Arming Europe Will Proceed in Two Steps

[United Press, Washington, 17th] Department of State Information Officer McDermott announced today that the United States is considering aiding Western Europe, with the economy preceding military affairs. This principle will be the basis for the U.S. government's decision on appropriating cash and materials. The military aid to Europe plan will not hinder the European Recovery Program.

The United States is currently arming its friendly countries in Europe. The first step will be to supplement the shortcomings of the existing overseas troops. This is at least the policy for the first year of the future military aid plan, which begins on July 1. In the second step, the United States will supply guns, tanks, and equipment in order to establish new corps within the territories of Western European countries. The entire plan is to build a barrier to prevent the westward advance of Communism. McDermott's statement proves that the future U.S. military aid plan will be a cautious and long-term move, and does not want to rush to complete it. President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson both attach importance to European economic recovery. Truman has also specifically stated that the main reason for the United States to arm Western Europe is to eliminate the sense of insecurity that hinders the recovery plan.

[United Press, Washington, 17th] The Economic Cooperation Administration today urged Congress to quickly pass the second-year budget for the Marshall Plan so that it can be connected when the first-year funds are exhausted on April 3. A spokesperson for the agency said that unless the funds can be connected, the foreign aid plan will be seriously hampered. The second-year budget is 5.58 billion U.S. dollars, which is currently being discussed in the Senate and House subcommittee and has not yet been voted on.

### Eastern European Countries: Military Assistance: Have Signed Bilateral Treaties

[This newspaper dispatch] London, 18th broadcast: Prague dispatch: According to investigation reports, there are as many as twenty-one military treaties between Eastern European countries controlled by the Soviet Union, including Yugoslavia. However, most of them are signed by two countries rather than including a military alliance of most countries. Each treaty stipulates that if Germany or other countries directly or indirectly related to Germany attack, the signatory countries must immediately provide military assistance. These treaties were signed between 1943 and 1948, and most have a term of 20 years.

### Japanese Diet to Reconvene Today: Opening Ceremony to be Held

Yoshida's Policy Speech Likely to be Postponed

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] The Japanese Diet is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony on the 19th. Starting on the 22nd, the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors will begin deliberating on bills. The Prime Minister's policy speech, originally scheduled for the 22nd, may be postponed to the 25th or 26th due to delays in the preparation of the budget.

### To Prevent Future War New Attacks: U.S. Decides to Deploy on West Coast: Believes Soviet Submarines Cannot Exert Power

[United Press, Pearl Harbor, 17th] Only four years after the United States seized hegemony in the Pacific Ocean from Japan, it has once again deployed a major defense line on that ocean all the way to its own west coast. Although the United States has reduced its army, navy, and air force in the East, it has not reduced its submarines, and its strength is still quite strong. The Pacific Command's envisioned defense line is Japan, the periphery of Okinawa, and the Mariana Islands. However, the cost of supplying and transporting this defense line is high. Military observers believe that once a future war breaks out, the U.S. West Coast industrial and aircraft factory area will be the target of enemy long-range bombers or submarine-launched guided bombs. The only way to deal with this type of attack is to deploy defenses in the possible areas of attack and in Alaska. The purpose of the westward shift of the naval and air forces of the Hawaiian Island base is to achieve this. Pacific Fleet Commander Ramsey announced that the Navy and Marine Corps Pacific Air Command are moving from Hawaii to San Diego. Therefore, the Hawaiian Islands will no longer have any value in being attacked when World War III breaks out. Observers expect that no enemy in the Far East will be able to pose a major threat to the United States on the Pacific Ocean. Although the U.S. fleet in the area is sparse, a large fleet can be assembled within 24 hours to deal with any possible maritime threats. With the main defenses of the United States deployed on the West Coast, the supply line is shortened, and enemy submarines will have no chance to succeed. Although the Soviet Union claims to have many new German-style submarines, it is feared that they do not have sufficient driving experience.

### ICA Officially Announces US Rice Will Arrive on Schedule Next Month, Requesting Funds to Extend Rationing Plan

[Report from this newspaper] Rumors have been circulating for days that US aid food and other materials will be temporarily suspended before Congress extends the Aid to China Act. This news has greatly affected people's morale, and food prices have soared. Yesterday, the ICA officially announced, in order to reassure the public, that the US-aided rice for April will be shipped to China on schedule to maintain the food supply in this city. Acting Director Griffin of the ICA also firmly guaranteed that the agency has sufficient funds to prevent the interruption of aid to China. The food rationing plan can be maintained until mid-May of this year, the US cotton supply plan can be maintained until early May, and the oil supply can last until early June. These actions are not affected by the congressional debate on extending the Aid to China Act. It is said that the ICA is requesting the head office to continue to allocate funds to extend the rice rationing plan until the end of June and to purchase more US cotton and petroleum products. Acting Director Griffin also stated that some people have been speculating on commodities in recent days, relying on the fear that US aid will be suspended. In fact, such speculation is unwarranted. We are well aware of the importance of the Aid to China program to the livelihood of Shanghai residents. If it is suddenly suspended at this time, it will inevitably deepen the suffering of ordinary people. Therefore, the ICA is working closely with the US Aid Utilization Committee to extend the period of assistance as much as possible under legal prerequisites.

### Murder of Lieutenant Quartermaster Case, Qiu Huanxing Sentenced to Ten Years

Yang Guihe declared not guilty

[Report from this newspaper] Qiu Huanxing, who used the alias Liu Zijin and served as a police officer in the North Station Police Branch, was originally a sergeant in the Forty-Ninth Army. On May 23, 1946, he was transferred to Shanghai and served as a sergeant quartermaster in the Independent Station of the Joint Logistics Headquarters. He had a dispute with Pan Muhua, the lieutenant quartermaster of the station. Later, due to poor service, he was dismissed from his position in July of the same year. He suspected that Pan had instigated the dismissal, so he and Bai Yukun, a private in the station, pre-purchased a pair of sharp scissors and secretly plotted to kill Pan. At around 7 a.m. on the 2nd of the following month, the two took advantage of Pan's deep sleep in the house and sneaked in together. Bai held down Pan's hands, and Liu stabbed him in the throat with the scissors, and Pan died. After achieving their goal, they fled separately.

He was soon found out about the previous incident and was transferred to the District Court for interrogation.

### Strange Disease Appears in Shanghai, High Fever and Unconsciousness, More Than a Dozen People Infected

[Report from this newspaper] According to news from the medical community in this city: Since the beginning of spring, due to abnormal weather, a new infectious disease has appeared in this city.

### Rent Standards Set Too High, Original Plan to Be Re-examined

[Report from this newspaper] The Municipal Government held a routine municipal conference yesterday morning, chaired by Mayor Wu. During the meeting, the rent collection standards in this city were discussed, but no concrete decision was made. It was resolved that the Counselor's Office should re-examine the original plan.

### Young Woman Makes a Scene at Auditorium, Prevents Wedding from Proceeding, Both Parties Argue at Police Station

[Report from this newspaper] Li Yunzhang, a native of Ningbo, 28 years old, residing at No. 21 Hongxing Lane, Beijing Road, is the young owner of Li Zhuoji Silk Store. In 1940, he married a woman from Sheng County, Wu Xigu (27 years old), who is currently a nurse at Dade Hospital. Not long after the marriage, they had a daughter named Mao Mao. Later, due to disagreements, they filed for divorce in court in April 1948. The woman requested alimony, but mediation failed. Wu then returned to her hometown due to illness, and the case was left unresolved.

Recently, Li was introduced to another woman, Zhu Yaozhen (26 years old, residing at No. 31, Lane 643, Jianguo West Road), and they were scheduled to hold their wedding at the Yiyuan Hotel at 3 p.m. yesterday. When Wu learned of this, she repeatedly hired a lawyer to publish a warning in the newspaper. Li replied through a lawyer that he had been divorced by the court in December of last year, so he continued to prepare for the wedding. Yesterday afternoon, just as guests were arriving and the hosts and guests were enjoying themselves, Wu and her lawyer, Lou Yunmei, and several uniformed men stopped the wedding from proceeding. Negotiations continued until 6 p.m., but no results were achieved. Li then called the Lujiawan Branch, which dispatched a flying fortress and took the bride, groom, Wu, and others to the police station for further mediation.

### Emerging in the Changyang Road Area, Three Notorious Robbers to Be Sent to the Police Department, Numerous Cases Solved, Stolen Goods Displayed for Owners to Claim

[Report from our newspaper] Huang Zhen, the director of the Yulin Road Police Precinct, recently received a confidential report stating that a group of robbers frequently appeared in the Changyang Road and Xuchang Road area. He instructed the judicial section to investigate and apprehend them. On the morning of the 12th, section chief Cheng Wengui, along with officers Zhu Bozhong, inspector Zhang Shanjie, police chief Liu Renqian, and police officer Cheng Yuguang, rushed to the area around the former Mingyuan dog racing track to conduct a surprise inspection.

### Jiaotong University Researches New Science, Soil Testing Laboratory Established, Faculty and Students Design and Build Independently, Not Relying on Foreign Goods

[Report from our newspaper] April 8th is the anniversary of National Jiaotong University. In addition to opening various laboratories for visitors to tour on that day, the school will also hold a commemorative meeting in the morning, followed by celebratory ball games in the afternoon. The school will provide longevity noodles at noon to entertain all faculty, staff, and alumni.

[Another report] The Jiaotong University Soil Testing Laboratory has been established. Soil mechanics is an emerging science with great relevance to foundations, roads, and airfields. The Shanghai Dredging Bureau was the first to create a soil testing laboratory in China, but unfortunately, some of its equipment was lost during the war. Subsequent establishments include the Central Hydraulic Laboratory of the Water Conservancy Department, National Central University, and Tsinghua University. The experimental equipment at Jiaotong University is considered unparalleled in Shanghai, with all components designed and manufactured independently by faculty and students of the Civil Engineering Department, without relying on imported goods. Currently, the laboratory is capable of conducting the following experiments: (1) Specific gravity of soil particles; (2) Moisture content of soil; (3) Particle size analysis (both sieve and mechanical analysis methods are available); (4) Liquid limit; (5) Plastic limit; (6) Shrinkage limit; (7) Centrifugal moisture equivalent; (8) Field moisture equivalent; (9) Permeability rate; (10) Proctor compaction test; (11) Direct shear test; (12) Optimum moisture content test; (13) California bearing ratio test; (14) Unconfined compressive strength test; (15) Quick sand phenomenon test. The following experiments are still under active preparation: (16) Retaining walls; (17) Seepage models for soil and rock collapses; (18) Energy of capillary action; (19) Triaxial compression test; (20) Frost heave test.

### Cultivating Cotton Fields to Improve Raw Cotton

Furthermore, recognizing that domestic cotton fibers are short and dull in color, requiring urgent improvement to increase their spinning value, the Jiaotong University Textile Society has established a raw cotton planting experiment group this semester, setting aside open space as a cotton planting field. They are currently consulting with experts to analyze the soil and will contact the Raw Cotton Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to obtain necessary supplies such as cotton seeds, fertilizers, and insecticides.

### The Beiping Model (7)

— Jiang Xue

A Road Report About a City Before and After "Local Peace"

The place of detention was two thatched huts, each about one and a half square zhang, with wheat straw underneath, where we slept on the ground. When I arrived, there were already eight or nine comrades detained there, the longest had been detained for eight days, and had only been questioned once. After I arrived, everyone talked about their experiences of being detained, telling me many past situations, and in adversity, we all became friends. Following me were nine students, from Hubei, Sichuan, Guangdong and other provinces, all carrying passes, so there should have been no problem passing through. However, because they had previously studied after demobilizing from the Youth Army, they were detained. After they arrived, they were indignant, saying that their detention was unjustified, and their reasons were very legitimate! In the evening, ten more people came, including Yang Hongcai, the deputy commander of the Sixth Army of the Northeast. They had been trained in the Northeast, issued passes, and allowed to return home, but they were also detained. That night, there were more than thirty people in these two small huts. Imagine how they could fit. Everyone had to sit on the ground and could not sleep. In the middle of the night, the guard comrade came to lecture us, making everyone's mood very bad!

Those detained here were supplied with prison rations, corn buns and raw cabbage. I had never eaten corn buns before, and this time I got to taste them, which was a kind of life experience. But the next day, the news came that the superiors had issued a notice that prison rations would no longer be supplied, and we were not even given corn buns to eat. Therefore, they tried their best to relieve the prisoners. The students and Yang Hongcai and others were released one after another, leaving only nine people. That night, three more were released, leaving only six people.

It was heard that the director of the Public Security Bureau came, and he personally handled the matter. Therefore, many of those with lighter circumstances were released yesterday, and today others were processed. In the end, only I was left here. I was summoned by the director and talked to him for an hour or two. He said that their inspection work should only take two forms: either allow them to pass through or not allow them to pass through and order them to return. They should not be detained here like this. What crime is this considered!? He promised to handle it for me immediately, but it was delayed for another day. After being detained for a total of five days, I was allowed to go back. Then I passed through a certain place, and took a bus to Jinan.

Along the way, all the places I passed were old liberated areas. The land in many villages had already been distributed, while some had not yet been distributed. Land distribution was done by village. If the population of this village was small and there was a lot of land, then the amount of land per share would be more. If the population was large and there was little land, then the amount of land per share would be less. The usual situation was three to five mu of land per share, with each person, regardless of age or gender, receiving one share. The land distributed to soldiers serving in the army, if there was no labor force at home, would be cultivated by the whole village on their behalf. Thirty catties of public grain must be paid per mu of land, which is an obligation to the state. Now, because the army is moving south, preparing to liberate all of China, the Bohai Military Region is also implementing a policy of borrowing grain from the people to maintain government expenses.

The CCP's rural policy is relatively strict! These many old liberated areas have mostly undergone struggle sessions and purges. I asked a farmer if his family had been purged. He answered softly? His family used to have dozens of mu of land, but because of the purge, they now only have a dozen mu left. The rest of the furniture and clothing have also been purged. He also told me that there were cadres everywhere, and told me not to talk nonsense. When I was resting on the road, two children asked me for money. I was very surprised. Later, the landlady of the store said: their family used to be very well-off, but because they were struggled against, they are now beggars.

The CCP's power has penetrated into the countryside. The militia and village schools are their grassroots organizations and cadres, with a very strong controlling force. For example, this time the army moved south, they transferred many rural cadres to participate in the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign. These cadres are strong and powerful elements, which is a major force in the CCP's success. The people of each village regularly convene various meetings to solve their own problems, training every illiterate farmer or old woman to be able to use many new terms and speak out a lot of reasoning. In every newly liberated area, or newly captured soldier, a grievance session is held to tell of some of the pain he suffered in the past, and to place the responsibility for this pain entirely on the Kuomintang, in order to raise their vigilance and hatred, and to deal with the Kuomintang together.

The road from here to Jinan is very bad. Often, if you are not careful, you will get the car stuck there and cannot move forward. I arrived in Jinan on the evening of the 27th. I passed through several checks along the way, and they were all approved. I stayed in Jinan for two days, asking about the forward route, and decided to take the route through Qingdao. I took a train from Jinan to Weixian, and then took a bus from Weixian to Tongcun. Twenty miles east of Nancun is the National Army's defensive line. I passed through several checks along the way, but they were not as strict as Jiedi and Dezhou. I did not have a travel permit this time, but I was able to pass safely. I arrived in Qingdao on March 4th, stayed in Qingdao for two days, took a boat to Shanghai on the 6th, and arrived in Shanghai on the 8th. I was very lucky!

(9) After Arriving in Shanghai

I lived in Beiping for about a year and a half. Beiping was besieged on December 13th last year. I lived in this besieged isolated city for more than a month, personally experiencing the bloody smell of war. After the announcement of the local peace measures, and the entry of the Communist army into the city, I stayed in Beiping for nearly a month, seeing and hearing with my own eyes many facts about the realization of local peace in Beiping. At the same time, my contact area in Beiping was not too narrow. Of course, this report will be more true and consistent with the facts than those who only went to Beiping for a trip, or those who only saw a part of the surface phenomenon under surveillance and protection. In terms of the causes and consequences of the event, perhaps I can know a little more.

I used to be quite optimistic about the situation in North China. I believe that Fu Zuoyi's style, thinking, strategy, and the cooperation of the party, government, and military with him are more advanced, progressive, and capable than many military leaders and the political situation in various places across the country! In the many battles that were being lost all over the country, Fu Zuoyi's troops in North China won a lot of battles. Nie Rongzhen fought him and was always at a disadvantage. But the result was a local peace. Local peace is surrender. This has been proven to be absolutely true in the factual development in Beiping! What a tragic situation this is! The failure to decisively evacuate Zhangjiakou and concentrate the basic troops in Tianjin and Beiping to fight a real defense war was a major error in his strategic command, resulting in the irreparable failure that followed. The CCP also admitted that Fu Zuoyi still wanted to fight, but because of the losses and sacrifices in Chahar, he had to bow his head.

Beiping surrendered. But many authorities and people all over the country are still yearning for the local peace in Beiping. They are very concerned about the situation in Beiping. The local peace in Beiping has become a kind of "Beiping model." Therefore, I specially wrote this article. The atmosphere of national peace talks is developing intensely. It is reported that after the fall of Sun Ke's cabinet, the succeeding cabinet may appear in a "peace cabinet" posture. Everyone's hope for peace talks is obviously very eager! These many facts and emotions are similar to the situation in Beiping during the period of peace talks in the past. I am not opposed to peace, and I am a person who very eagerly hopes for permanent peace. However, the lessons of reality do not allow me to place greater hope on peace talks. The local peace led by Fu Zuoyi has become the "Beiping model," but there are no provisions to punish "war criminals" in it. For example, "war criminal" Fu Zuoyi himself is the opposing party in their peace talks. But Mao Zedong's eight-point peace declaration, the first point of which is to punish war criminals, is of course more than the conditions for local peace in Beiping! Today, the government's peace talks with the CCP are prepared to be based on Mao Zedong's eight-point peace declaration. Assuming that this peace talk can be negotiated successfully, will it be able to achieve better results than the peace in Beiping? Assuming that the Nanjing government immediately expresses its surrender to the CCP, I think the CCP will not be able to put forward more severe conditions than Mao Zedong's eight-point peace declaration! Many members of the literati class and the petty bourgeoisie, fantasizing about peace, often take one or two relatively emotional words from the CCP as a great spiritual comfort, and believe that the prospect of peace talks is very promising! This kind of erroneous thinking that ignores the essence of the problem and is obscured by surface phenomena will lead to even greater mistakes! The CCP's view of all problems is determined after scientific research and careful discussion, and is not determined by personal emotions at the moment. They are now engaged in a political struggle, dealing with problems by revolutionary means. The CCP's attitude is clearly expressed in the editorials of the Xinhua Daily, "Carrying the revolution through to the end" is their true attitude! Today, the Nanjing government hopes to achieve something in the peace talks, which is like a toad wanting to eat swan meat. I think the greatest achievement is only to delay time, so that they can prepare to complete, or even create some convenience for them to liberate the whole country. I personally do not have much hope for peace talks! The fragile will and emotional illusions of the petty bourgeoisie are sufficient to mislead people and the country today. Temporary respite is not a solution to the problem.

### Blood Splatters Turtle Head Isle: Military Officer Xu Zhongli Meets Calamity, Singer Shen Lifang and Others Suspected and Detained

— Our Reporter Shi Wuwei

[Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 17th Dispatch] A shocking bloodshed case occurred on Turtle Head Isle in the Taihu Scenic Area on the morning of the 16th. The deceased, Xu Zhongli, was a military officer. He, along with Hua Zhichun, a senior staff member of Lixin Textile Factory, Yu Zongjie, and "Sweeties" singer Shen Lifang, Shen's cousin Yu Aju, and one other person, a total of five, were touring Feiyun Pavilion on Turtle Head Isle. Unexpectedly, joy turned to sorrow when Xu was suddenly attacked and shot three times, dying instantly on the spot. After the incident, Hua and the others immediately returned to the city and reported to the city defense inspection team. Team leader Guo personally led his team to hunt down the assailant. After searching for two hours without success, Hua and the other three were interrogated separately late into the night. They are now beginning to trace leads. According to Team Leader Guo's observation, the case is very complicated. It doesn't seem like robbery and murder, nor does it resemble a political assassination. In short, it's not a general bloodbath that anyone could encounter; rather, there is another reason. The deceased was the specific target. Hua, Shen, and the other three have been detained for further investigation due to the severity and high stakes of the case involving human life.

Lover of Elegance

Distinguished Couple's Spring Outing

Xu Zhongli, 35 years old, was from Anyue, Sichuan. In the spring of the 35th year [of the Republic], he came to Wuxi with General Mao Sen. Initially, he served as an inspector in the Wuxi City Defense Command, and then was reassigned as an intelligence staff officer. After the disbandment of the command and Mao's departure from Wuxi, Xu retired from the military and took on the role of the head of the employment guidance group at the Veterans Association, as well as the leader of the military training corps at the county's administrative cadre training institute. Last month, the county government recruited township self-defense deputy team leaders. Xu took the examination and was selected, being assigned to serve in the Zhongxiao Town area of Malu. However, Xu usually enjoyed frequenting singing halls, where he became acquainted with Hua Zhichun and Yu Zongjie, both senior staff members of Lixin Textile Factory. Hua was a renowned "filial son of singing halls." If he encountered a singer with a pleasant appearance, he would lavish her with praise and gifts without restraint. Initially, he pursued singer Tian Ying. After Tian left Wuxi, he turned to Shen Lifang. The night before last, Xu and Hua met again at the Sweeties singing hall. They were especially enthusiastic due to their long-awaited reunion. Subsequently, Hua proposed inviting Shen Lifang and others to tour the scenic spots. Xu and Shen were also acquainted, so it was agreed that they would meet at 8 a.m. the next morning at Shen's residence in the China Hotel. Yu Zongjie borrowed a car from the factory for their use. At 8:30 a.m., the group of five arrived at Turtle Head Isle.

Ambushed

Grieving Widow

After Xu and the others arrived at their destination, they followed the path up the mountain, climbing to the summit and enjoying the scenery to their hearts' content. When they reached the Lake and Mountain Restaurant at Feiyun Pavilion, they were all very hungry, so they each ordered a bowl of dumplings and noodles, enjoying a satisfying meal while overlooking the lake, making for a very pleasant experience. At the time, Xu sighed and expressed dissatisfaction with the current society, saying, "Here, I just hope to eat, drink, and be merry." Afterwards, they went to the nearby Lanfeng Pavilion for photography. Unexpectedly, just as they were in high spirits, five uninvited guests wearing short clothes and carrying short guns suddenly appeared, ordering them not to move. Then, the ringleader of the thugs robbed Xu of his Central Military Academy badge, a briefcase, a gold ring, and a watch, saying, "You guys are having fun while the situation is like this!"

Following this, they fired a shot at Xu, hitting him in the chest. Xu, clutching his chest, said, "We are all our own people, why is this necessary?" The thugs fired two more shots, and Xu fell to the ground. Seeing that they had caused trouble, the thugs told Hua and the others to leave quickly and not to report it. Hua and the others, still in shock, hurried down the mountain and returned to the city in the original car, reporting the truth to the city defense inspection team. Team leader Guo personally led his team to rush to the scene of the incident to search, but found nothing. Xu's body was transported back by car by Township Head Jiang of Zhongxiao Town and placed downstairs in the town government office to await the funeral. Xu's wife, Chen Peizhen (from Hunan), along with their five-year-old daughter, Yuan Ying, also arrived upon hearing the news, bursting into tears, a scene of extreme grief.

Strong Suspicion

Singer Detained

After Team Leader Guo returned to the team, he immediately summoned Shen Lifang and the other three for questioning. According to Shen's statement, she was 20 years old, from Shanghai. She originally worked as a singer at the Huadu Ballroom in Shanghai. Two years ago, she came to Wuxi and sang at Xianle. At that time, she met Hua Zhichun, who frequently came to support her. A year and a half ago, at a party held at the residence of Staff Officer Li Yuankai, she met Xu Zhongli and danced with him several times. Later, she returned to Shanghai and recently worked as a clerk at the China Shipyard. Because the factory was going to relocate to Taiwan, she asked for leave. On the 12th of this month, she was invited to Wuxi by Manager Jiang Xianji of Sweeties as a guest performer, preparing to return to Shanghai on the 15th. Coincidentally, Hua invited me to go sightseeing, she said. According to Hua Zhichun and Yu Zongjie, Xu Zhongli's visit this time was of his own volition.

Team Leader Guo

Reviews the Case

Team Leader Guo stated: He believes the inside story of this case is complicated and does not seem like robbery and murder, because if the purpose was to obtain money, at that time there were no tourists in the park, and the bandits could have searched and robbed at their leisure, but although the bandits searched Xu for weapons, they did not search him thoroughly, so a small gold bar and an oil shop bill on Xu's body were not robbed. At the same time, the bandits did not pay close attention to Shen Lifang's dazzling diamond ring, so it can be determined that the bandits' purpose was not to obtain property, and the robbery was merely a convenient act, or a cover-up. It also does not seem like a political assassination because Xu did not often go to Turtle Head Isle. It is impossible for the bandits to have planned an ambush there. According to Team Leader Guo's conclusion, the reason for the occurrence of this case should be sought outside of the two possibilities of political assassination and robbery and murder. It may be a vendetta, or it may involve other relationships. In short, it does not seem like an ordinary robbery case. The team has now obtained important clues and is sending personnel out to investigate, and the truth will soon come to light.

Respectful Letter, I have served in the education field in Northern Jiangsu in my early years, as an elementary school teacher. After the War of Resistance, I traveled to the rear, enduring great hardships. Unfortunately, I suffered from a stubborn disease—bone tuberculosis—lingering for several years. The medical expenses have been exorbitant, and due to circumstances at home, our family property has been depleted. The entire family's food and clothing are on the verge of destitution. White-haired elders and young children are crying for food, suffering from hunger and cold, urgently needing to make a living to take care of the family. I am moaning in bed, medical expenses require considerable funds (50 bottles of special medicine are needed), and for a time, I am truly unable to raise them. In desperation, I dare to ask your esteemed newspaper to appeal to people in society for help, so that I may continue to receive treatment, to avoid losing all previous efforts. If I can recover from my chronic illness, and have the skills to make a living in the future, I will certainly repay the amount in full, or in accordance with the principle of "gained from society, used for society," turn to helping the poor and sick. I would never dare to fail the great virtue of benevolent gentlemen. Respectfully addressed to

The Social Services Department of Shen Bao. Zhang Musheng, bowing respectfully, March 1st.

According to Mr. Zhang's statement of poverty and illness, the investigation has confirmed that this is true. Therefore, the letter is disclosed, hoping that enthusiastic people will provide assistance. If you donate medicines or funds, they can be transferred by our department. (Editor)

### Cash Shortage Still Not Eased, National Banks to Issue Silver Dollars Starting Yesterday, 25% of Deposit Balance, Valued at 7,000 Gold Yuan Per Dollar

[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday, the cash shortage still did not ease. In order to remedy the shortage of cash in circulation, the Central Bank began to issue silver dollars to silver firms who withdrew cash yesterday. According to yesterday's method, silver firms with deposits every other day can receive 5% in cash and 25% in silver dollars of the deposit balance, totaling 30%. However, the maximum cash withdrawal is still 10%. If the maximum cash withdrawal is taken, the silver dollars will be reduced proportionally to 20%. Yesterday, each silver dollar was valued at 7,000 gold yuan. According to a spokesperson for the Central Bank, 300,000 silver dollars were issued yesterday. It is said that the silver dollars issued were still old silver dollars from the treasury, so they include various styles and are not limited to the "Boat Dollar."

Furthermore, according to a relevant authority at the Central Bank, since national banks are issuing silver dollars to silver firms, if depositors of various banks cannot obtain cash, they can also apply to the original bank for silver dollars in proportion to their deposits.

The cash shortage in the Shanghai market continued yesterday. Cash discounts and acceptance bills are still popular. Retail prices on the market have discovered two types, one for negotiable instruments and one for cash, the former being about 10% higher than the latter. Salaried employees and ordinary citizens are complaining incessantly, hoping that the financial authorities will quickly find a way to improve the situation. According to the national bank, the cash shortage originated in other ports and has only recently affected Shanghai, and can be eliminated in a short period of time. However, according to general qualified financial personnel, the authorities' measures to tighten cash in order to prevent price increases are not thorough. Because not only has it failed to suppress the rising trend, but it has also contributed to it. Looking at the extent of daily price increases, we can know a general idea. Also, after the balance deposits turned over to the national bank by banks every other day are restricted from withdrawal, how can the interest on the deposited portion be passively sacrificed, so measures must be taken to compensate for it. The phenomenon of cash discounts is clear proof. The person believes that the way to stabilize prices is to reduce issuance and shrink the capital, there is no other good strategy. It is by no means possible to achieve an overall stabilization of prices by merely tightening cash. It is said that the degree of market price invigoration is too fast, resulting in decoupling from the amount issued, which is an undeniable fact. However, it cannot be solved by tightening cash, it depends on the issuing authorities responsible for using sophisticated techniques in advance and making full preparations.

### Gold and Cash Slightly Up

[Our Newspaper News] Gold fell slightly in the morning session yesterday and rose slightly in the afternoon session. The market's money supply is extremely loose and excessive, and hidden interest rates are exposed, arousing the interest of bullish investors. Furthermore, because the stock market is sluggish, outside capital is hedging, and buying is still strong. However, because of the sharp rise in recent days, people are wary of heights, and it is rumored in the market that the Central Bank is selling, so the market is strong but soft, and the overall trend is very weak, with few peaks seen. In the early morning, due to the extremely loose money supply, and because the strong market the previous night was not diminished, the initial bids were 480 and 485. After the opening, many floating profits were frequently obtained, and new buyers were afraid of repercussions and were very cautious, and the market gradually declined to 469, 472. After a small decline, retail investors absorbed, and the market rose again, reaching 484, 487. However, the peak was fleeting, and selling on the table was still frequent, and it fell again to 472, 475. Then it rose again to 486, 489. Near noon, it was heard that the Central Bank was selling, and people were strangely nervous, but in the end, due to the excessive amount of loose capital and strong purchasing power, the afternoon close was slightly softened and closed at 478, 481.

The afternoon opened with interest at 510, 515. After the opening, it fell slightly to 511, 514. After the low, it rose slightly again to 517, 520. Soon after, it fell sharply to 500, 503.

[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday, the money supply opened in the morning still following the loose trend of the previous day, and day trading was between 50 and 60 yuan. After 10 o'clock, the demand for capital from various industries increased, and the demand list turned hot, and day trading once rose to 70 yuan, but the supply list was still abundant, and day trading fell again. In the afternoon, it was heard that the national bank had sold gold at low prices in the market, and the loose money supply was slightly reduced. There were quite a few people who dug up capital to accept gold at low prices. After a cyclical rise in prices, the money supply gradually stabilized cyclically. Finally, it was heard that the day trading was between 70 and 80 yuan.

### More Than 30 Gold Businesses Have Resumed Registration

[Our Newspaper News] Outside, it is rumored that the Ministry of Finance has unofficially notified the Gold Industry Association to resume business on Monday next week. Yesterday, the reporter inquired again with a gold industry leader about the possibility of this statement. According to the report, the resumption of business sooner or later still depends on the registration of resumption of business by members, the progress of the arrangement and layout of the meeting place, and the fundamental issues such as installing telephones. If these factual obstacles can be overcome early, the resumption of business can also be realized one day earlier. At present, more than 30 members have registered to resume business. However, it is still impossible to confirm the exact date of resumption of business.

### Floating Capital Continues to Flow Out, Chinese Stock Market Still Weak

[Our Newspaper News] The Chinese stock market was still weak yesterday. Gold outside the circle continued to rise sharply, and floating capital in the industry flowed out again. The money supply in the market was flat to flooding yesterday, and the supply source was even more vigorous. The interest outside the stock exchange was as low as 4 jiao, 3 and 4 jiao, 8 fen. However, because the overall situation was dull and the industrial and commercial crisis was fraught with ambushes, people had many concerns. Furthermore, it was Friday as usual, and many parties had to bear two days of interest, so many floating positions were closed and there were not many new buyers, and the market fell into a slump. The afternoon close ended at a low price. At the beginning of the morning, Yongsheng Yarn was bid out at a high price of 6 yuan and 7 jiao due to the trend of loose money supply. After the bid, the bidders started to pull up the price, rising to 6 yuan and 77 fen. The floating profits of the previous night were frequently sold, and the market softened, with a low of 6 yuan and 58 fen. Various parties absorbed again at low prices, and it rose again to 6 yuan and 68 fen. The securities gang sold hard, and the market fell straight, plunging to 6 yuan and 29 fen. Afterwards, the major players tried their best to tout, and the market rose again, rising to 6 yuan and 7 jiao, but it still did not get rid of the slump. Near noon, it was heard that the rumor that the national bank was selling gold was very strong, and people's hearts were shaken, and the trend plunged again, with a low of 6 yuan and 27 fen. Near the close, the trend of gold rebounded, and people's hearts stabilized slightly, and finally closed at 6 yuan and 4 jiao and 2 fen.

The small and medium-sized stocks opened fairly flat at the beginning, and followed the trend of Yongsheng Yarn in the middle. The trend was dazed and hovering, and the afternoon close also fell. The opening of Xinhe rose by 1 jiao, and the afternoon close was still at the original price. The opening of Meiya rose by 1 jiao and 8 fen, and the afternoon close fell back by 1 jiao and 3 fen. The opening of Jingfu and Qinxing was flat and weak, and the afternoon close was soft. Xinguang still has behind-the-scenes pull-up relationship, and the afternoon close is still at the original price. The remaining stocks did not improve, and the transaction volume was 5.2426 billion shares.

Foreign Stocks and Public Bonds Continue to Rise

The foreign stock market was still prosperous yesterday. Foreign exchange securities continued to rise sharply. People are optimistic and there are many holders, and the market unanimously bid high prices. Yisha did 10,800 yuan, 11,000 yuan. Yeguang 3,800 yuan, 4,000 yuan, up 400 yuan. Jardine Matheson 38,000 yuan, also showed agility.

The trend of gold public bonds opened sharply in the morning. There were bids for 245,000 yuan. Later, due to the decline in gold prices, it was as low as 240,000 yuan, and then rose all the way to 256,000 yuan. The afternoon close was 245,000 yuan. The afternoon close was 250,000 yuan, and the transaction volume was small.

### Rice Is Firm, Flour's Rising Trend Not Eased, Edible Oil Rises Again

The rising trend in the rice market has expanded. The money supply is loose and excessive. The price of gold is much higher than yesterday, so people's hearts are very firm and the owners are quoting very hard. The opening of the Nanshi market only rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Later, it was heard that the Beishi market rose more, so it went up again. The Booda once reached 50,000. The closing price was slightly back to 49,000 yuan, up 4,500 yuan. The early rice rose by 55,000 yuan. The opening of the Beishi market soared by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. The white japonica once reached 50,000, and the market price was slightly back to 49,000 yuan, and the Booda was also 49,000 yuan, each rising by 5,000 yuan. The special japonica was as high as 52,500 yuan. The arrival of goods in the two markets was 8,215 shi.

Edible Oil

The rising trend is even more severe. Because the money supply is still loose and the price of gold is high, retail investors take the opportunity to fight for it. The opening price did not rise much. Later, because the buying momentum was strong, it rose wildly again. Soybean oil rose from 186,000 to 197,000 at the close, an increase of 22,000. Rapeseed oil rose by nearly 20,000. Raw oil is a rare commodity, and a bucket of raw oil is as high as 260,000, a sharp increase of 45,000, reaching 20%. Soybean cake is up by 2,000 yuan.

Flour

The rising trend has not eased. The loose money supply remains the same. The Northern Gang continues to search vigorously. Furthermore, the price of gold and rice has soared, and people's hearts are extremely high. At the beginning of the opening, all goods generally rose by 1,000 yuan. In the middle of the process, the Fuxin factory sold about 3,000 to 4,000 packages, and the market once fell. The closing price finally rose again because the price of gold remained firm. The military ship was offered at 18,880 yuan near the close, and the old car was offered at 19,600 yuan. Bran continued to rise by 1,000 yuan, and a large package was offered at 15,200 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains

The rising trend has turned fierce. Under the extremely smooth sales of soybeans, the owners tried their best to raise the price. Winter beans rose sharply by 20%, and the price of truck beans was as high as 41,000 yuan. Corn was vigorously absorbed by the Qing Gang, which caused a sharp increase of 30%. Raw kernels broke the 100,000 mark, and sesame and red grains rose by more than 20%. Pudong mud beans broke the 50,000 mark.

### Cotton Yarn Holds Firm, Cloth Market Sees New Highs

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions saw liquidity and external factors remaining favorable for buyers. Confidence in higher prices persisted, and sales remained active. The process involved holding firm at current levels, ultimately resulting in an average price increase of approximately 50% for various yarns.

42-count "Blue Phoenix" yarn fluctuated from 3,140,000 yuan down to 3,110,000 yuan at the close, a rise of 140,000 yuan from the previous day. Other brands like "Celestial Maiden Treasure Light" were trading above the 3,000,000 yuan mark. 40-count "Blue Phoenix" also broke through the 3,000,000 yuan barrier, eventually closing at 3,007,000 yuan, a gain of 110,000 yuan. 32-count "Silver Moon" opened in the morning at 2,030,000 yuan, and subsequently, due to strong demand from local textile manufacturers, the price steadily rose, reaching a high of 2,200,000 yuan at one point, before settling at 2,140,000 yuan, a substantial increase of 210,000 yuan.

21-count "Double Horse" spot goods saw a modest rise of 80,000 yuan, closing at 1,635,000 yuan. 20-count "Double Horse" yarn reached 1,570,000 yuan, up 110,000 yuan. Other grades of coarse yarn also followed suit and increased.

The cloth market continued to progress well, largely due to the abundant liquidity in the market (daily interest rates around 55 yuan). The Cantonese merchants maintained a strong interest in buying, but other groups showed little interest. Local spot transactions were not inactive, and sellers generally showed little inclination to sell. Various cloths reached new highs again. "Dragon Head" fine cloth initially opened at 69,500 yuan, then broke out of that range, reaching a peak of 73,000 yuan. Near the close, many took profits, and the price retreated slightly to 71,500 yuan at the close, up 6,500 yuan from the previous day. Medium-grade fine cloths, such as "Trumpet Boy" and "Big Double Dragon," also rose by around 5,000 yuan.

"Four Gentlemen" raw serge fluctuated from 68,500 yuan, down to a low of 66,100 yuan, eventually closing at 66,800 yuan, up 4,900 yuan. "Golden Lotus Enchanting Dance" raw serge rose by 4,000 yuan, closing at 63,000 yuan. 190 high-grade shirting reached the 140,000 yuan mark. In the afternoon, the off-market trend was again bullish, with reports of "Four Gentlemen" raw serge at 71,500 yuan and "Dragon Head" fine cloth at 76,000 yuan, but without actual transactions.

### China Textile Sells Yarn

Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual, offering a total of 15 types, selling 47 lots in total. 20 prospective buyers participated, with a total value of 14,782,000 yuan.

### Rayon and Raw Silk Surge, Silk and Satin Market Remains Mediocre

The rayon market continued to be bullish yesterday, with vigorous price increases. In the morning, due to abundant liquidity, it was difficult to secure short-term loans, leading to a resurgence in buying interest.

120-count Toyo rayon opened at 2,200,000 yuan, briefly rising to 2,220,000 yuan. After reaching this high, sellers began to liquidate their positions, and external gold prices retreated slightly. Market sentiment turned weak, and a soft wind began to blow across the stagnant market. Bids gradually drifted lower, reaching 2,160,000 yuan at the midday close, and finally closing at 2,100,000 yuan. In the afternoon, liquidity remained high, and buying interest was still strong, initially bidding at 2,200,000 yuan, then rising to 2,290,000 yuan.

Raw silk foreign exchange certificates surged again yesterday, greatly boosting confidence. Trading desks took advantage of the positive sentiment, and the midday close saw further gains. Premium spot lots initially opened at 2,620,000 yuan, briefly rising to 2,750,000 yuan. Due to some profit-taking at higher levels, the price retreated slightly near the close, eventually closing at 2,715,000 yuan at midday. In the afternoon, liquidity remained high, and bids were slightly higher, initially bidding at 2,740,000 yuan, then rising to 2,800,000, finally reaching 2,750,000 yuan.

The silk and satin market saw weak buying interest yesterday, with actual sales lackluster. Market supply and demand shifted, resulting in sluggish absorption. Prices retreated after reaching high levels, and the close was quite mediocre. "Meiya" silk opened in the morning at 1,110,000 yuan, then weakened, with market sentiment declining to 1,085,000 yuan. Subsequently, local demand picked up slightly, and bids rose slightly to 1,100,000 yuan at the midday close.

### Exported Crated Tea Stagnant

[Report from this newspaper] According to sources familiar with the tea industry, although the prices of red and green teas have been increasing daily since sellers began using exchange transfer certificates to offset valuation losses, the price of exported crated tea is becoming increasingly out of line with international tea prices, deterring buyers. This has resulted in a near-tragic situation for recent exports of Chinese tea, and the outlook is not optimistic. Domestic tea sales are also mediocre, with few transactions and rapidly rising prices.

Another report: Local shops, feeling that the continuously soaring tea prices are making it difficult to cover costs under previously agreed-upon prices, have, starting today, authorized the guild to revise prices again to provide relief, increasing them by about double compared to before. It is reported that the minimum price for Longjing tea is 3,200 yuan per catty, and the maximum is 48,000 yuan. The minimum price for black tea is 1,600 yuan per catty, and the maximum is 32,000 yuan. The minimum price for jasmine tea is 1,600 yuan per catty, and the maximum is 32,000 yuan. Gongju chrysanthemum is priced from 3,200 yuan to 9,600 yuan per catty, and white chrysanthemum is priced from 1,920 yuan to 2,560 yuan per catty.

### Tung Oil Continues to Rise

The price of tung oil continued to rise in yesterday's market, due to the extreme abundance of liquidity within the industry and the upward movement of commodities outside the industry. At the same time, it was reported that the production price of tung oil in Hankou was still being quoted in silver dollars, causing confidence to increase rapidly, as if having broken free from reins. Near the close, prices rose again by 20,000 to 25,000 yuan. However, buyers, constrained by narrow domestic and foreign sales channels and weak demand, resulted in continued sluggish transactions.

### Commercial Briefs

In recent days, the price increase trend has become more severe. Many local businesses and companies are abolishing the practice of marking prices on goods in response to the market situation. Some are assigning numbers to goods, but without directly marking prices.

Taxi fares in the city are being adjusted from today. Twenty minutes will cost 6,000 yuan, with an additional 5,000 yuan for every additional five minutes. One hour will cost 18,000 yuan.

The price increases for cigarettes, soap, and matches have slowed slightly. Various grades have risen by only 100-200 yuan. Morning trading opened steadily, with continuous sales of distributed goods. Holders, due to interest rate relationships, were unwilling to easily sell off their holdings, and bids rose slightly, but the increase was not enough to cover interest expenses. "White Tin Package" cigarettes were priced at 8,450 yuan, up slightly by 200 yuan. 20-count "Great Britain" cigarettes were priced at 3,550 yuan, also up by 100 yuan. Other grades generally saw modest gains. "Guben" soap saw strong buying interest, with prices exceeding 70,000 yuan, reaching 72,000 yuan, up by 3,000 yuan. Assorted brands generally showed strength. Hot-selling match brands generally fell, while assorted brands generally rose by 20,000-30,000 yuan.

### Market Stroll: Watching the Scalpers

Big bills, come out now! Don't be coy! Snatching silver dollars – the "scalpers'" business – society is so merciless!

Silver dollars are the medium for small clerks to preserve currency value and to make a living day by day.

The cost of living index this time, as we analyzed the day before yesterday, the discount on the index itself, the discount on the continued rise in prices, is virtually halved. In addition, it coincides with the soaring price of silver dollars and the panic of cash. Salaries are paid in promissory notes, and silver dollars must be purchased with cash. Therefore, exchanging promissory notes for cash requires an 80% discount. With silver dollars rising by as much as 40% in recent days, it is equivalent to another 60% discount.

After careful calculation, this time the salary of 100,000 yuan for middle and upper-level employees is actually not worth even 20,000 or 30,000 yuan; it is truly a hard blow.

Yesterday, the Central Bank released more than 300,000 silver dollars. Is it lacking head money in large bills? Or is there still a need to scour cash?

For days, the Central Bank has allocated gold, limiting the receipt of cash. It is said that it released silver dollars to banks to alleviate the cash panic in various banks.

If banks use silver dollars to pay salaries, it will indeed help alleviate the cash shortage. But those who are relieved are limited to internal employees of the banks, and manufacturers still cannot figure out a solution.

In fact, why bother to learn from the bound feet, a clear article has been announced long ago to issue big bills. Asking commercial groups to request the issuance of big bills, this kind of trick is pointless and few people will have the courage to do so again.

The trend has been straightened out, we can speak frankly; issuing big bills will definitely increase prices. Not issuing big bills, the cash shortage is the cash shortage, and the price increase is the price increase, horizontal increase and firm increase are still increases, why add a cash shortage with twisting and pinching? Moreover, in today's style, the Central Bank cannot be suspected of controlling cash to earn arbitrage. If there is suspicion, regardless of whether it is true or false, the Central Bank authorities are always wronged? That's even more sympathetic!

Everyone is talking about silver dollar scalpers. "Scalpers" has a contemptuous tone. In fact, they just don't have a lot of capital to do business, but their business methods are really no different from the managers and directors of large companies.

I don't intend to defend them here. I want to talk about their bright future.

In this situation, small clerks used to hoard food and buy soap, but now their vision has to become shorter and shorter. Although they are unwilling to keep paper money in their hands, they have to keep money in their hands that can be carried with them.

Gold and US dollars are the kings of money, but small clerks don't dare to touch them, so they naturally have an indissoluble bond with silver dollars.

Now, most of the general clerical class buy silver dollars with their salaries, and each person is buying groceries with silver dollars. Buying them all at once, and each person is going out; every silver dollar vendor will be like the money exchange shops of the past.

It is precisely because silver dollar transactions have a bright future that the establishment of a gold and silver market has the effect of dividing its benefits. Think about it, even these benefits are not allowed to be done by these unemployed citizens. The degree of social ruthlessness and coldness is also conceivable!

### Banks, Except for Special Permits, May Not Buy and Sell Gold and Silver

[Report from this newspaper] According to reliable sources: Because the Central Bank's remittance income in recent months has still not reached the expected target, it has changed the overseas remittance listing method in the past week. In the six overseas remittance ports of Guangzhou, Shantou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Wuzhou and Qingdao, the Central Bank examines the actual situation of the local area and lists prices separately. At the same time, the Bank of Communications assists in collecting remittances in the six locations. The purpose of this move is to make the overseas remittance rate and the national bank that handles foreign exchange in various markets, so that overseas remittances can flow back to the motherland through the national banks that handle foreign exchange, and increase foreign exchange resources. This method has been implemented on a trial basis for a week and has achieved good results. Once it has achieved considerable results, the entire implementation method will be officially announced. It is heard that in the past week, the income of overseas remittances has been greatly reduced because the overseas remittance price has failed to meet the reality, and only a few hundred thousand US dollars were received for the entire month.

### Overseas Remittance Income Has Not Increased, National Bank Changes Listing Method

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Gold Management Bureau recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the financial reform case stipulates that people are allowed to freely buy and sell gold and silver, and the national banks can also buy and sell gold and silver to stabilize the market price of gold and silver. However, if general silver banks and financial institutions are allowed to purchase and sell gold and silver in large quantities, it is not in line with the normal operations of the business. In order to implement the policy of stabilizing finance, it is specifically stipulated that banks, except for those with special permits, are still not allowed to buy and sell raw gold and silver. Those who violate this will be dealt with in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Banking Law. The 38-year short-term gold bonds issued by the government are securities. Silver banks and financial institutions can buy and sell securities within their approved business scope, and they should be allowed to buy and sell gold bonds. However, after the protection is due in the middle of the period, the gold obtained from the repayment of principal and interest and the transfer form thereafter shall be reported to the Ministry for verification. After receiving the order, the Bureau has ordered the three guilds of silver, money, trust, commerce in the city to inform their members to comply with it.

Yesterday, the National Bank continued to allocate the original gold to the bank building. At 11:00, it allocated 150 taels at the then current price of 484,000 yuan per tael. In addition, the bank continued to sell gold to other markets in succession, totaling more than 50 taels, with varying prices.

### Today's Grade A Football: Jingwu Faces Zhichao Again

There is only one Grade A football league match today, held at the Yiyuan Stadium at 3:00 PM, where Jingwu Club will once again face Zhichao Club.

In the first week of the special round-robin tournament, Jingwu initially scored two goals, but Zhichao caught up with three, turning defeat into victory. Further, riding the momentum of breaking the leader's dominance, led by iron defender Wu Qixiang, they have made significant progress in technique. The whole team prioritizes defense over offense. Wu Qixiang, stationed at the third inner defense, is like a natural barrier. If Jingwu's young players want to break through Wu's heavy defense from the middle, it is akin to making a mosquito carry a mountain or a toad swim a river. With the support of the veteran Wu, the midfield line has gradually become stable, and the young players in the forward line are quick enough to advance. However, they tend to be overly focused on ball control. Right winger Shang Shiqi has good footwork, enough speed, and delivers crisp passes. If Zhichao's offense can receive a steady stream of crosses from Shiqi, Jingwu's penalty area will inevitably face a severe threat.

Jingwu's young players are not always consistent in form. At their best, they have forced a draw with Qingbai. When out of form, they are disorganized and chaotic. If Ma Qunxian can return in time from Hong Kong, the forward line can be strengthened. However, he also tends to be overly focused on ball control, wasting time and hindering efforts. If they attack from the middle, it would be akin to attacking strength with strength, which is definitely not the best strategy. They should use the flanks more to restrain Zhichao's inner defense, creating opportunities for activity within the penalty area. The defense is quite balanced, but the offense is relatively weak, not enough to break through Zhichao's defense. Therefore, Jingwu's young players must have a fearless spirit and fight to the end to avenge their previous defeat.

### Pan Team Defeats Public Transport Yesterday, Hopeful for Promotion to Senior Group

Yesterday, the Pan team eliminated Public Transport with a score of 4-1 in the South City, winning the right to the loser's final. They are scheduled to hold the loser's final with Gonghexing next Wednesday (23rd) at 4:00 PM. The winner will then face the losing team in the regular final next Friday (25th) at 4:00 PM to determine the runner-up and the qualification for promotion to the senior group. The dates of this competition will not be changed unless it rains. Because the senior group has been decided to open next Saturday (26th)

Yesterday, Xu Heming of Public Transport opened the scoring, and Zhang Xiaofei of the Pan team equalized. After switching sides, the Pan team showed its strength, first with Qian Mingyuan's shot scoring, taking a 2-1 lead. Then Qian Changxing and Zhou Liuxiong both scored with headers, resulting in a 4-1 victory. Both sides played well.

### British Grand National Race Begins

[British News Agency, London, 18th] This year's British racing season began on the 17th. As usual, the first event held each year is the Lincoln Race, which includes the famous Lincolnshire Handicap, which will be held on Saturday and will coincide with its 100th anniversary. But the history of horse racing in Lincolnshire is more than a century old. According to the city hall records, a certain expense was approved in 1597 that was related to horse racing. Another record states that King James I of England visited the Grand National Race in Lincoln, but it was not until 1680 that it was regularly held every year. The history of British horse racing is even earlier than the dates recorded in these ancient archives. When the Roman authorities governed Britain as a province of the Roman Empire, horse racing was a common sport. According to historical records, organized competitions were held more than 1,700 years ago at a location where steeplechases are still held today. British horse racing affairs are managed by an organization called the "Jockey Club." This club was established 200 years ago. The Grand National Race held in Epsom every June may be the most famous horse race in the world. This is a national event. Even those who do not usually ask about horse racing often bet on this race. Those who attend the race can see a unique, colorful, and magnificent scene in British sports life.

### Australia Requests to Host the World Games

[Associated Press, London, 17th] Melbourne Radio broadcasted that the Australian delegation has decided to go to Rome next month to participate in the meeting of the International Olympic Committee to apply for the World Games in 1956 to be held in Australia.

### Sports World: Three Basketball League Matches Tonight Shanghai Police Re-Encounters Peifeier John Faces Li Team in Women's Group

There will be three basketball league matches today, starting at 5:30 PM for men's Grade A, Grade B, and women's groups, continuing to compete at the Municipal Gymnasium. Tickets remain the same, 500 for upstairs, 1,000 for downstairs, and 1,500 for numbered seats inside the arena. The order and referee list are as follows:

Li Team——John (Women's Group) 5:30 Referee Liu Hesheng Wu Zibin

Shantou Team——Chongde (Grade B D) 6:15 Referee Zhou Huaibang Xuan Zhijie

Shanghai Police——Peifeier (Grade A Group) 7:15 Referee Jin Botao Hu Zongfan

In the opening match of the women's group, Li Team will face John again. According to the initial match between the two teams, John defeated Li Team 41-28. However, John has only won this one game in six games. After playing Li Team tonight, there is only one game left against Xinghua, so the victory or defeat will be related to the golden parcel. If they fail, they will have the same score as Li Team. However, John has good players such as Li Senlin, Jingyi, and Zhang Luoluo, so victory is expected. Li Team is weaker in strength. In addition to Fan Yuying and Liang Miaozhen, their experience is insufficient. However, the team has an excellent spirit. They have been defeated repeatedly, but their courage is unabated. When the time comes, they will resist to the end, and there will be a fierce competition.

Next, the Shantou team will play against Chongde in Group B D. The former has played twice, with half wins and half losses. The team originally had a considerable history in Shanghai, but after reorganization, talents were scattered. Although Chen Qingjiang, Zhou Bin, and Zheng Guofan are old partners, their cooperation is not as good as before. Today's game against Chongde, Chongde has lost both games in this group, and their fighting power seems to be the weakest. However, they will try to cheer up after being defeated twice and do their best to compete with the Shantou team, so the number of wins and losses is unpredictable.

The finale is the Grade A group Shanghai Police and Peifeier meet again. According to the first cycle, Peifeier was defeated by the Shanghai Police, losing nine points. However, since entering the second cycle, they have defeated Hualian, won against Haiqing, and defeated Mailing Max three times to avenge their previous defeats. The often defeated team has changed into a winning team. Captain Kelle Black Carbon Brown is playing better and better, and Icart Glagich Yexiang cooperate with each other, and their cooperation skills have also made great progress. Shanghai Police is their enemy, and they must seek revenge when they meet again this time. The Shanghai Police has been quite disadvantaged in the second cycle, suffering a defeat to Mailings and a crushing defeat to Encas, while they were all defeated by Shanghai Police in the first cycle. Tonight is another time to defeat the invading army. Learning from the past and being wary of the future, Jin Gui, Bowen, and Qixia should plan early to defeat the enemy and restore their reputation. When the time comes, the mighty forces from the East and the West will put on a tight performance in a battle of dragons and tigers. The rosters of the six teams are as follows:

(Li Team) Weng Xiayun, Wang Jiahua, Liang Miaoling, Yao Wenda, Liang Miaozhen, Fan Yuying, Chen Shanbao, Liu Danzai, Zhang Shanfu, Zhou Younan.

### Women's Basketball Techniques

— Public Translation

Figures two and three illustrate two basic zone defense formations. When the ball is passed into a specific area, the defensive formation shifts in accordance with the ball's location.

These two formations clearly divide the three defenders into three lines of defense. (Figure two) When the ball is passed by the offensive team's center to the right side of the basket, the right defender forms the first line of defense outside the free-throw circle line; the center defender is positioned on the free-throw line to form the second line of defense, and the left defender is positioned at the corner of the semicircle to form the third line of defense. She is the last line of defense, guarding the area under the basket, preventing the offensive players from shooting or tipping the ball into the basket.

Figure three depicts the opposite formation. When the ball is put into play from the center circle and passed to the left, the left defender sets up the first line of defense, the center defender remains in the second line of defense, and the right defender is the last line of defense. By observing the dotted lines on the court in Figure one, it becomes clear that the defenders move according to the ball's location, similar to the formations in Figures two and three.

The third basic movement is illustrated in Figure four. When the offensive player holds the ball in the central area, the defensive formation only needs to make simple movements. It remains divided into three lines of defense. The right defender stands at the top of the semicircle, forming the first line of defense, the left defender sets up the second line of defense behind the free-throw line, and the right defender guards the third line of defense under the basket. In this situation, the defenders only need to guard the offensive player holding the ball. They do not need to follow the other offensive players who do not have the ball. The most important thing is to firmly guard their assigned areas. When the ball reaches another area, the defender in that area must quickly arrive at the location of the ball. However, it is not advisable to move too early, as this would create an opening for the offensive player to cut in. The defenders should remain calm and avoid being deceived by feints, which could lure them away from their assigned areas. If they can accurately predict the offensive player's movements, they may even be able to intercept a pass.

Following this formation for defense, as soon as the ball leaves the hands of the offensive player, the defender guarding her must immediately retreat and adopt a moving zone defense based on the ball's location.

Offensive players may sometimes employ three forwards clustered in one area to launch an attack. The moving zone defense must be effectively used to defend against this offensive tactic, which relies on the second line of defense as its backbone. The defender in this line must have sharp judgment, be clever and agile, and time her movements perfectly. If she possesses these skills and performs reliably, acting as a pillar of strength, the defense can remain as solid as a rock.

However, it is important to remember several key principles. The defender's strategic key area is a zone with a radius of fifteen feet, with the free-throw line as the central point. The defensive work should employ delaying tactics rather than decisive actions. The goal is not to immediately steal the ball but to delay the offensive player's scoring opportunity. It is crucial to remember the moving zone defense. If the ball is in the eastern zone, the defender in the eastern zone rushes towards the ball-handler, while another defender fills the defensive line that the first defender is responsible for guarding. This is a unified effort of three, requiring coordinated communication to form the entire defensive formation.

The diagram illustrates an offensive forward holding the ball. The right defender sees the ball's location and rushes forward to guard her. If the offensive player passes the ball to another offensive player who is only a few feet away, the right defender must immediately shift her position to guard the player now holding the ball. The center defender and the left defender also shift their positions to the right, acting as a fan-shaped movement.

If the offensive player passes the ball to another offensive player standing in a more distant and deeper area, the responsibility of filling that space falls on the center defender guarding the second line of defense, who moves forward to the right as much as possible to guard the ball-handler. (To be continued. Four)

Figure Five: Analyzes the importance of the defender in the second line of defense.

### Record of Salary Depreciation

— Suo Bei

This happened around the time of mid-month payday.

On the afternoon of the 14th, several colleagues, with serious expressions, held a meeting for most of the day, earnestly discussing how to handle the upcoming salary. Of course, everyone knew that the amount was small and not to be overly hopeful about, but they still wanted to create some "miracles" with this meager sum to help supplement the expenses of half a month. Among the various opinions on gold, goods, and short-term interest rates, there was unanimous disgust and rejection of "Yuan Datou" silver dollars, with everyone saying they would never fall for the "fool's head" again. "Look, the 'Big Head' was already 1,600 at the beginning of last year, and in the following month or so, it only fell, never rose. Last time, a bit of 'contingency money' was all used to buy 'Big Heads.' Bought at 1,600, sold at 1,400. It was truly tragic, infuriating, and resentful!" - This was everyone's collective opinion.

The meeting continued. For the sake of caution, the possibility of "Big Heads" rising in the coming days was reviewed and studied for about half an hour. No one could think of any reason for it to suddenly soar.

On the night of the 14th, I suffered from insomnia for two hours. The reason was: buying "Big Heads" was most suitable for our kind of status; buying anything else would require finding connections and a larger sum of money. But after careful consideration, I felt that we should learn from past mistakes and not support Yuan Shikai's brain, only to suffer the consequences.

On the morning of the 15th, I washed my face, skipped breakfast, and rushed to the office to collect my salary. Everyone no longer considered "Big Heads." They unanimously thought that the Central Bank would dump a large amount of gold, credit would tighten, and it would be better to put it into "weekly deposits." This was easier to handle and wouldn't be "too much of a loss." At least, it could maintain some of the currency value. Some people preferred to put it into short-term interest rates, even if it meant not buying oil, rice, firewood, and salt for their families.

What was the result? After noon on the 15th, "Big Heads" jumped from 44 to 48. By the evening of the 16th, they had reached a peak of 65, rising faster and more violently than gold and banknotes, and dwarfing the short-term interest rates of "weekly deposits." Thus, I was once again infuriated and resentful!

"Look, whatever we buy doesn't rise; whatever we don't buy rises! It's clear that scholars seeking profit are like scholars rebelling - in the end, they accomplish nothing!"

In fact, the reason for this is worthless: all the factories, stores, and public institutions in Shanghai all pay salaries on the 15th. Civil servants take this small amount and have no other ideas for making a profit, so naturally they still buy "Big Heads." So how could "Big Heads" not rise madly? How could I have stayed up all night, held a meeting for half a day, and still not figured out these principles?

Thinking of this, I could only tap my own not-so-big "head" helplessly, pick up my pen, and write an article for "Free Talk," partly to vent my anger and partly to earn a bit of稿費(稿費 is untranslatable but it roughly means payment for submitting articles), to make up for the loss.

Yuan Datou, wrongly headed, resentful head!

### The Reason for Issuing Large Denomination Banknotes

— Sima Niu

There was a merchant who wanted to count ten billion banknotes to see how long it would take, so he decided to experiment. He took a hundred five-yuan banknotes and counted them one by one. After counting them, he recorded the time it took. Then, he assumed he had to count ten billion yuan of five-yuan banknotes, working eight hours a day, six days a week, and calculated the time it would take based on the time it took to count just now. The answer was exactly thirteen years.

Alas, this is why large denomination banknotes have to be issued!

### The Uniforms of the Court

— Lei Chang

The uniforms of the criminal courts in our country use three colors, blue, white, and red, for trimming, which is determined by the colors of our national flag "Blue Sky, White Sun, Red Earth," with profound meaning.

The trimming of the judge's uniform is blue, to show impartiality and express the spirit of integrity of the so-called "Blue Sky."

The lawyer's duty is to protect human rights and uphold justice, shining on humanity like the white sun, so white trimming is used.

The task of the prosecutor is to eliminate corrupt officials and sweep away the dregs of society, so red trimming is used to express his spirit of courage and inviolability.

### No Ruler in All of China

— Chen Yi Xian

Confucius said: "It is better to have no ruler in All of China than to have a ruler among the barbarians." "No Ruler in All of China," at the time people took this as equivalent to "A Dream of Yellow Millet." All refers to Zhu Zhen Zhuang, Xia refers to Xia Jing Guan. Zhu had passed away for many years, Xia is still alive and well. People only know that the two were known for their poetry, but they do not know that both were revolutionary practitioners. Xia served as secretary to Su Fu Cheng Dequan. In 1911, Dequan responded to the Wuchang Uprising led by Li Yuanhong, and Xia played a significant role in it. During the late Qing Dynasty, Feng Qijun (zi Shaozhu, from Guangdong), the Hubei Provincial Police Commissioner, although corrupt and lecherous, with a notorious reputation, was extremely alert and capable. Many members of the party were harmed by him. When Rui Cheng arrived, he first impeached him, and Zhu Zhenzhuang supported this from the sidelines. Feng Qijun was succeeded as Police Commissioner by Huang Zuhui, a kind and honest elder. The success of the uprising in one day and night was not unrelated to this. If Feng Qijun had still been serving as Police Commissioner at that time, the situation might have changed, which is unknowable. Rui Cheng fled, but Zhu Zhenzhuang did not become prominent. He secretly helped members of the party, and did not claim credit for his achievements, which was especially rare.

"A Dream of Yellow Millet" refers to Huang Jun and Liang Hongzhi, which the world knows. Huang, after one term, transferred to the university, while Huang graduated from the translation school, one class ahead of me, and was a B-level student. Liang's poetry collection, Aiju Ge Poems, and Huang's notes, Flowers Accompany People (the so-called "Flowers" refers to Liang Cuifen, a famous courtesan from the north, whom he took as a concubine), were both famous at the time. But the fates of both men turned out like the prophecy of "A Dream of Yellow Millet," ending badly, which is strange and tragic. How can this be compared to Zhu Zhenzhuang and Xia Jingguan’s deeds, which are worthy as historical materials for the revolution?

### The Mystery of Animal Energy

— Ding Yi

Just as humans are boasting about the discovery of atomic energy, the animals in the universe have long possessed amazing skills. A certain type of bird, smaller than a robin, makes two non-stop flights of two thousand miles each year; a certain insect can jump a distance more than a hundred times its body length, and jump to a height five hundred times its body height. The beetle is also a miracle; it can lift something weighing five hundred times its own weight.

Where this energy comes from remains a mystery. If we humans could learn the beetle's ability, we could easily lift thirty-six tons of weight, or jump over skyscrapers.

The golden plover of Alaska flies back and forth to the Hawaiian Islands every spring, flying non-stop over two thousand miles of landless ocean. Because birds' beaks are not suitable for catching insects in the air, it can be determined that they do not eat anything during long-distance flights. So, where does enough energy come from for them to expend?

Long ago, the famous French entomologist Fabre spent years patiently observing the small animals in his garden. He noticed a young scorpion, which, although it had not eaten food for a week after birth, was still able to move and expend energy. The same was true for newborn spiders. This phenomenon greatly puzzled Fabre.

He also conducted an experiment, placing scorpions in a glass bottle, containing only sterile fine sand and air. After nine months, they were still alive, and the insects had even grown larger. Fabre was bewildered by this miracle at the time, and we still have not broken this mystery.

The mystery of human Yang Mei has been solved, but the mystery of animal Yang Mei still baffles people.

### World Clippings

— Cang Yi

In 1924, a certain Neapolitan in Italy made the world's largest candle to commemorate the Italian musician Carducci. The candle weighed over three tons, was twenty feet high, and had a circumference of seven feet. Every year on All Souls' Day, this candle would be lit for twenty-four hours. Calculated, it could burn for eighteen hundred years.

Someone in England has invented a new method of removing smoke and dust using sound waves. An instrument creates high-frequency sound waves, causing the particles of smoke and dust to form clumps. After an hour, they fall from the air. It is said that the sound waves can be manufactured cheaply on a large scale. It is expected that in the future, every important chimney will be equipped with this new invention.

### Radio Broadcasting and High Blood Pressure

— Wu Ren

A doctor studied the causes of high blood pressure. His hypothesis was that it was due to listening to radio broadcasts. He tied a blood pressure monitor on his arm and turned on the radio.

The experimental results were:

(1) When listening to programs you dislike the most, blood pressure is highest, especially if you hate them, with a great risk of stroke.

(2) When listening to programs you like, blood pressure drops.

(3) General, so-so programs have little effect.

### Sitting in the Tower

— Shi Shufan

Again I see drooping flowers on withered vines,

Sitting in the tower, I truly forget my sorrows,

Garden beans and wheat in the suburbs are neat and strict,

City lights twinkle with boundaries of safety and danger.

Deep spring, narrow land, few people walk,

Old teacher, tired horse, who listens?

Should cherish the instructions, which are heavenly intentions,

Record the weeds early on the stele of merit.

Already from white bones I have gathered yellow gold,

Grieved to the point of silent, sorrowful moaning,

Awake in the divine palace with dreams of civil and military,

Three years in the mortal world with a heart of chaos and separation.

What concern is there with the watch fires shaking morning and evening,

Only fear the shallow depths of the river tide,

Thunder rumbles, doves coo, seasons change,

Opening the window, I close it again on the shadows of spring.

### "Spring Thunder" Review

— Ye Fei

The films of Yonghua Company, from "National Soul" and "Secrets of the Qing Palace" to the current "Spring Thunder," consistently tell the audience: "I am willing to spend money!" This is undoubtedly a good phenomenon when the market is flooded with crudely made national films stuck in the era of "Burning Red Lotus Temple."

The story of "Spring Thunder" is very sentimental and has a didactic theme, but it is not annoying. The content tells of a young, wealthy industrialist, Pan Shuming, who first meets the socialite Shen Manli, and later marries his fiancee, Li Hanfang. A child in Shen's womb is born with Li's support, to illustrate the responsibility of mothers to the second generation. The setting of Spring Thunder is used to delay the voyage, to portray Manli offering herself to Pan, and Pan drowning in Australia, all of which directly happen to Pan Shuming but affect Li Hanfang's life, which should have been smooth.

Li Hanfang is the most important protagonist in the film, from a charming girl, a gentle wife, to a virtuous mother, and the process is very natural. Virtuous women are not uncommon in today's society, but women with insights and willing to take responsibility, like safeguarding the posthumous child of her husband (conceived by her husband's mistress), focusing on the education of the innocent second generation (a small part of it is because of love for her husband), rather than as the world imagines, "preparing to be a ready-made old lady" (as Shen Manli said), is truly rare. In the end, when Shen sees that Pan has escaped danger and returned, she threatens to take back the child in order to force Pan to rekindle old feelings. Li's view is: Shen must ask herself whether she is worthy to be the child's mother. "A man often leaves behind a child because of a moment of pleasure, irresponsibly walks away, and even thinks that money can redeem this sin, without knowing that a mother who gives birth to a child should not only give him clothes and food, but more importantly, give him education" (paraphrased). This not only warns all the absurd men in the world, but also gives mothers a lot of inspiration. The actress Li Lihua is very serious, portraying the three eras distinctly, and her performance is pleasant and competent. Compared to her previous role in "Fake Phoenix, False Phoenix," when she was only selling "娇(娇 is untranslatable but it roughly means coquettishness)," she is in a different league.

Sun Jinglu's Shen Manli is very enchanting. Although influenced by the stage, some actions (such as arguing with the old man looking after the house) are inevitably exaggerated, but overall she can act even better than Li Lihua. The close-up when she pretends to be dizzy, with her eyelashes moving and the corners of her lips slightly opening, is very imaginative. The second half is not outstanding, and the screenwriter should be responsible for that. Shen Manli's personality is not consistent before and after. At the beginning, Shen fell in love with Pan at first sight, absolutely for the sake of loving Pan, not for loving Pan's money, which sets her apart from ordinary prostitutes. However, when Shen learns of Pan's death, she is not sad but intends to abort the child. Pan's wife asks her to keep the fetus, and there has to be a gentleman's agreement to "exchange half of the inheritance for the child." How did she become so unreasonable? Now that she has become so unreasonable, giving up so easily in the end seems too impossible.

The screenwriter is biased towards Pan Shuming. He writes about him being reserved towards Shen Manli at the beginning, and regretting it later. The screenwriter and Pan himself blame it on alcohol, but according to the narrative on the screen, Pan had not drunk alcohol when Shen moved her glass into Pan's room. Afterwards, Pan could not resist the temptation of Shen's naked body and turned around to pour himself a drink. It is acceptable to say that Pan deliberately drank alcohol to increase his courage, but it is too forgiving to say that Pan lost his composure after drinking. (Moreover, this bottle of wine is arranged too abruptly. In a hotel room late at night, Pan is not a drunkard, so where did this large bottle of strong liquor come from? Did he know in advance that Shen Manli would faint in his room?) Yan Hua's performance lacks depth, and he is not likeable.

The supporting roles Jiang Ming, Yu Ling, etc. have good appearances, but Jiang Ming's Mandarin is unfortunately too bad.

The photography is very beautiful, and the scenery of Hong Kong and Kowloon naturally accounts for a lot of the light. However, when Pan dreamed of Shen Manli during their honeymoon in the countryside, there was no explanation of the dream scene in the photography, which surprised the audience. The close-ups of several people's faces in the fashion exhibition are really redundant, except to flatter a few temporary actors.

The sets and costumes are extremely lavish and extravagant. However, there are too many costumes, and the two leading actresses cannot wear them all, so they also arranged a fashion exhibition, which seems a bit deliberately ostentatious.

Finally, it should be mentioned that the film's sound recording is clear, which is rare in national films. The theme songs sung by the two leading actresses, before and after, are also unusually beautiful. Although it is a big joke that the "socialites" in the dance hall would actually broadcast popular songs that were sung by women from good families four years ago, that is the screenwriter's business and has nothing to do with the song itself.
