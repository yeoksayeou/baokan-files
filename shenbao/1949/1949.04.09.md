### Presidential Residence Late-Night Meeting: Peace Talks Approaching Critical Stage; Government Refuses to Transfer Military Power Within a Deadline

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Peace talks are approaching a critical stage. The next few days will determine whether peace can be achieved or whether the two sides will continue to engage in military conflict. Although optimists have found a basis for their optimism in some difficult facts, the obstacles encountered in the peace talks are undeniably significant. A certain authoritative person pointed out to reporters on the evening of the 8th: (1) The Communist army is demanding to cross the Yangtze River during the peace talks; (2) Acting President Li sent a telegram to Mao Zedong, reiterating his determination to seek peace; (3) He Yingqin hurriedly returned to Nanjing from Guangzhou; (4) Bai Chongxi was summoned to Beijing from Wuhan; (5) The activities in Beijing of the three representatives from Beiping should all be given attention. It is said that government representatives found considerable differences between the two sides in their initial talks with the CCP representatives in Beiping. Another point of contention is the issue of punishing war criminals, the first of the eight conditions. The CCP insists on adhering to the eight conditions in principle, only willing to relax the scale. The government believes that it should consider the people and only focus on future issues, without overly pursuing past responsibilities. At this critical stage of the peace talks, Acting President Li telegraphed Mao Zedong directly, frankly stating the difficulties and focal points of the peace talks, and was willing to bear the responsibility himself, with the aim of first seeking agreement and understanding on this issue so that the peace talks could proceed smoothly. As for the issues of crossing the river, reorganizing the army, and the future government, Acting President Li stated in his telegram that he would follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will to cooperate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and jointly assume responsibility with all democratic figures to build the nation. The intention is that if the peace talks are successful, people from all sides will form a coalition government, and the military issue can be easily resolved. The main purpose of He Yingqin's flight to Guangzhou was to listen to the opinions of party members on the peace talks. After staying in Guangzhou for two days, he hurriedly returned to Beijing. Bai Chongxi also came to Beijing from Wuhan on the same day at the summons of Acting President Li, indicating that there would be a major decision in Beijing on the evening of the 8th. This decision is also closely related to the fact that the three representatives from Beiping must return to Beiping on the 9th or 10th. The person predicted that the entire situation of the peace talks would have a decisive development within two or three days.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] It is reported that the formal meeting of the peace talks in Beiping had not yet started on the 8th. On the evening of the 8th, the government delegation, including He Yingqin, Yan Xishan, Bai Chongxi, Wu Zhongxin, and Tong Guanxian, gathered to discuss the peace talks, and dispersed at about 1 a.m. on the 9th.

Acting President's Telegram to Mao Zedong

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Acting President Li telegraphed Mao Zedong at 11 p.m. on the 7th. The original text is as follows: "Director Zhang Wenbai to Mr. Runzhi: Since Zongren took office, he has overcome all difficulties and is determined to seek peace. His sincere intentions are well known to all of your party's democratic figures. Now that the peace talks have begun, the government representatives have come to Beiping as invited, and the issues for discussion have adopted the eight articles proposed by Guanfang as the basis. Zongren is mindful of the cruelty of war, the suffering of the people, and the mistakes made in the history of mankind. Therefore, considering the focal points of the difficulties in the peace talks, I am willing to act with a compassionate heart and make further statements. All so-called historical mistakes that hinder peace, such as the so-called war criminals, even if [they] have committed egregious crimes, I am willing to be responsible for them all. My sincere intention is to invite all of your party's democratic figures to jointly shoulder the mission of building a new China. Moreover, as the international situation becomes increasingly complex, cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is even more urgent. If we both uphold this principle, other issues can be easily resolved. What does Zongren seek? What I hope for today is to turn swords into plowshares and to let the people live in peace. My sincere heart is as clear as white water. I am sending this telegram to express my sincerity, hoping for your understanding. Brother Li Zongren, 7th day of the 4th month (April) [seal]."

### Interview with Mysterious Guest from the South: Lengthy Conversation with Our Reporter for One and a Half Hours

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] The importance of the three individuals who arrived in Beijing on the 5th, accompanied by Liu Zhongrong, to the issue of peace talks has been confirmed by the developments of the past three days. The actions of these three individuals in Beijing are extremely mysterious, and government officials are very secretive about it. What can currently be revealed is that these three individuals represent three different positions. One of them is Mr. Li Minxin, representing Li Jishen. Another is said to have a very high status and his own personal position, engaging in the peace movement in a personal capacity, with no relationship to Li Minxin and the other individual. These three individuals are seen as mysterious figures in the political atmosphere in Beijing. However, apart from attending the dinner hosted by the Acting President on the evening of the 7th, they have not had any meetings. However, the achievements obtained by the reporter after three days of persistent pursuit have made it clear about their political environment. Therefore, their mystery, apart from the reporter being unable to announce their names on their behalf, has become an important political characteristic. Late on the 8th, the reporter requested to interview one of the three individuals who did not wish to announce his name in a house that was not a government residence. A conversation lasting one and a half hours allowed the reporter to learn about the efforts and achievements of the three individuals in the peace talks. This person has a very high status and was a teacher and friend of Lin Sen, Li Jishen, and Gu Zhutong. He has a consistent advocacy for peace. After the "local peace" in Beiping, he went to Beiping. This time, his coming south is "representing his personal [views]" to seek peace for the people. This person repeatedly stated that he has no connection with the other individuals who came with him. It is said that he did not exchange a word with the other individuals on the special plane. After getting off the plane, he took a car that came to pick him up and left the airport. The other two individuals got out of the car by themselves and ate noodles and got a haircut in a small shop in Fuzimiao, without being noticed. This person was wearing a blue cloth robe, of medium height, around fifty years old, with bright eyes, walking with a cane, and in excellent spirits. When he discovered the reporter at his residence late on the 8th, he showed a surprised expression. He avoided answering the actual questions asked by the reporter. Summarizing the hour and a half of conversation, what can be told to the readers is that this person's opinions on coming to Beijing to work for peace include the significance of the Acting President's telegram to Mao Zedong. This is the achievement of the past three days, but it is not their goal. They will continue to work to achieve the goal of peace. This person also said that if the goal is not achieved, they will not return to Beiping before the 11th. When asked whether this goal can be achieved, this person said that it will depend on everyone's efforts. In this person's conversation, it was shown that the difficulties of the peace talks are very great, but at the same time, it shows that peace is not hopeless. After arriving in Beijing on the 5th, he attended a long conversation with Acting President Li for two hours on the evening of the 6th. On the 7th, he attended a banquet hosted by Acting President Li again, sitting with the other two individuals. In addition, he has also met with important officials in Beijing very frequently. Gu Zhutong hosted a banquet to entertain them on the afternoon of the 8th.

### Observer Believes Communist Army Crossing the Yangtze Within Ten Days is Impossible

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] In the past two or three days, due to widespread rumors in Beijing that the Communist Party has issued an ultimatum to the government, the general public believes that the Communist army may cross the Yangtze River and advance southward within ten days, which has obviously caused a tense reaction in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other government-controlled areas. Moreover, Premier He Yingqin, who was originally scheduled to return to Beijing on Saturday, has specially returned to Beijing from Guangzhou today, which seems to further illustrate that the government must make a major decision on the demands made by the Communist side within a short period of time. As a matter of fact, since the Communist army launched the Anqing offensive on March 24, the Communist army's actions to capture the bridgeheads north of the Yangtze River, from Yizheng in the east to Hankou in the west, have already begun. Except for the Communist army's Anqing offensive being frustrated by the government forces and suffering a setback, in the area north of the Yangtze River east of Anqing, after two weeks of rehearsals, the Communist army has already swallowed four military strategic points: Zongyang, Liujiadu, Tuqiao, and Yizheng. At present, except for Huayangzhen west of Anqing, only one bridgehead has been swallowed by the Communist army. The remaining strongholds are still intact. Those east of Anqing include Erba and Yuxizhen on the opposite side of Wuhu, Xiliangshan on the opposite side of Dangtu, Liangpu area on the opposite side of Nanjing, Guazhou on the north bank of Zhenjiang, and Kou'anzhen on the north bank of Yangzhou, Liuxigang on the north bank of Jiangyin, a total of seven bridgeheads, which are still in the hands of the National Army. According to military observations, even if the rumored Communist ultimatum has been delivered to the government, and the Communist army's actual actions, if they only want to take down the above-mentioned seven bridgeheads before crossing the river in full force, it will still take two weeks, as in the past, to capture them. This only refers to the situation east of Anqing. Furthermore, regarding the Communist army from the opposite side of Jiujiang, Xiaochikou in the west, to Hankou, although they once advanced to Huangpi Station, less than ninety li from Hankou, they were immediately pushed back to the area 30 miles outside Hankou. Therefore, from the perspective of the military situation, unless there is a sudden change within the National Army, which would make it easy for the Communist army to cross the river, there is no reason to predict that the Communist army crossing the river within ten days can become a reality. Although the CCP radio station has repeatedly emphasized in recent days that the Communist army will attack south of the Yangtze River, its actual effect is more political than military. Today, Cai Mingyong, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, personally flew to the air above Heshangzhou in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River east of Zhenjiang in the afternoon to conduct an aerial inspection of the situation, clarifying that the rumors that the Communist army was using wooden rafts and small boats to cross the river in large numbers from there were completely inaccurate. Furthermore, according to the information obtained by the military, it has long been provided that the Communist army has gathered ships and troops on the north bank of the Yangtze River, which is a fact. Among them, the number of wooden boats gathered south of the Ji Lake on the north bank of the Wan River is about 10,000, with about 100,000 troops. This situation is indeed particularly alarming. According to expert judgment, this military situation, as well as sporadic small rebellions on the side of the National Army, such as the Banqiao Jia Yu incident, cannot but cause some psychological fluctuations on the National Army side of the peace talks. However, if both sides of the peace talks are determined to continue talking, this superficial situation is just an interlude of the sword dance at the Hongmen banquet.

### Mao Zedong Agrees to Stop Attacking Government Propaganda Offensive During Peace Talks; Has Notified Political Workers Not to Broadcast Provocative Words

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] According to sources close to Acting President Li on the 8th, Mao Zedong, at the request of the government peace talk delegation, has agreed to stop the "propaganda offensive" during the peace talks, and has ordered political workers to avoid attacking the government and government personnel in their broadcasts. This promise by Mao has been telegraphed to Acting President Li by Zhang Zhizhong on the evening of the 7th. As early as when the government representatives arrived in Beiping and contacted the Communist side, the government representatives mentioned this matter. Mao stated at the time that the sharp words criticizing the government were made by political workers and had nothing to do with the CCP authorities' talks on peace. However, in order to avoid excessive stimulation, Mao made this decision. The person also said that whether the CCP's promise has been fulfilled, we can obtain factual proof from later Xinhua News Agency broadcasts.

### Northern Jiangsu Tense, Yizheng Falls; Artillery Fire Across the River Clearly Heard in Zhenjiang; National Army in Jiangpu Recaptures Gaolidian, Communist Army's Offensive Thwarted

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 8th] Yizheng, an isolated city in northern Jiangsu, finally abandoned its defense at about 8 p.m. on the 7th under heavy artillery fire from the Communist army. The Communist army's artillery positions were set up at Xupu Bridge north of the city, with five heavy artillery pieces. They began firing more than 100 shells into the city and the Jiangmian River in Siyuangou at 8 p.m. At about 5 p.m., the county government caught fire after being hit by a shell, and several places at the large pier outside the south gate also caught fire. At this time, more than 1,000 Communist troops immediately attacked the west gate. The defending troops outside the north gate heard the news and reached the city to reinforce, but it was too late to stop them. A fierce street battle then broke out. County Magistrate Zuo Zhiren led the security forces out of the encirclement and retreated to the south gate (four li from Siyuangou). Unexpectedly, a part of the Communist army attacked from the west gate and then divided its forces to garrison the positions of the defending troops on the Shamanzhou southeast of the city, controlling the Jiangmian River in Siyuangou. County Magistrate Zuo then broke out of the south gate and searched for the Communist army along the Siyuangou Highway. While travelling to the Yisi Bridge, he encountered the Communist army midway and a battle broke out. County Magistrate Zuo's whereabouts are unknown after the fierce battle.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 8th] After the Communist army captured Yizheng, they launched an offensive against the Sancha River, Shijiaqiao, and Twelve Fort areas at dawn on the 8th. The rumbling of artillery fire could be clearly heard here all day long, and the glass windows in the room were shaking. The battle line on the Yangzhou-Liuhe line has now moved south to the vicinity of Zhujia Qigan and Lao Sifu, five miles south of Shijiaqiao. The National Army's positions are intact. The National Army on the south bank is now crossing the Yangtze River at night to reinforce Liuxu, Guazhou, and Twelve Fort.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 8th] The Yisiyuezhou in Yizheng is located between Twelve Fort and Gaozi, surrounded by water on all sides, forming an isolated island. At present, Fan Xiyuan, the head of the Second Regiment of the County Security Force, is leading his troops to stand by, but there is a shortage of food and ammunition. A telegram has been sent to the province to expedite relief. Also, the situation in Twelve Fort is becoming tense.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 8th] Province head Ding, Commander Wang of the Fourth Army stationed in Zhenjiang, and Deputy Commander Yang of the Provincial Security Force took the Hui'an gunboat to Guazhou and Twelve Fort to deploy the river defense and give instructions at 2 p.m. on the 8th, and returned to Zhenjiang at 5 p.m.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 8th] The situation in northern Jiangsu has suddenly become tense. It is rumored that the Jiangsu Provincial Government will move its office from Zhenjiang to Suzhou within a few days.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 8th] The authorities here announced today that the military situation on the north bank of the Yangtze River is tense, and the navigation line between Zhenjiang and Guazhou will be temporarily suspended.

[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] A telegram from Zhenjiang: Military sources said that the Communist army attacking Yizheng carried at least eleven 105mm caliber cannons, which were enough to cut off the Yangtze River traffic. The range of the cannons could even reach the railway line between Zhenjiang and Nanjing on the south bank.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Military News Agency report: The National Army in Jiangpu recaptured Gaolidian in one fell swoop on the morning of the 7th, and the offensive of the Communist Army's Wu Hua Thirty-Fifth Army was frustrated and retreated slightly.

### Increasing Pressure on the Periphery of Hankou; National Army Concentrates Forces to Form Strong Positions; Communist Aircraft Spotted Dropping Bombs Over Anqing

[Our Xiaogan Dispatch, 8th] Of the 1,124-kilometer-long Pinghan Railway, the National Army now firmly holds 73 kilometers near the terminus. The military force has rapidly concentrated on the north, east, and west sides of Hankou, forming a strong arc-shaped position. This situation has illustrated that the National Army has the confidence to ensure the safety of Greater Wuhan. Although the situation has reached a critical stage, the south of Xiaogan is still not overly panicked.

[Our Xiaogan Dispatch, 8th] Military news: The pressure from the Communist army on the western side of the railway facing Xiaogan north of Pinghan is visibly increasing. After 10 p.m. last night, two regiments of the 29th Brigade of the Communist Army's 10th Column once crossed Xiaojiagang and continued to flee south. They were bravely repelled by a certain unit of the National Army. Residents near Xiaogan could faintly hear the sound of cannons. It is reported that a part of the main force of the Communist army facing Pinghan, about 10,000 people, has arrived on the western side of the railway line from Guangshui to Huayuan. A part of the Communist Army's Jianghan Column between Anlu and Yingcheng is moving east. Residents in the western countryside of Xiaogan have already fled.

[Our Xiaogan Dispatch, 8th] Military news: The battle facing Pinghan is silent. Only small groups of Communist troops are active between Lujiashan and Xiaojiagang. The 13th Army Regiment of the Communist Army's Chen Qing unit in Macheng, eastern Hubei, arrived at Zhongguan Station west of Macheng yesterday, showing signs of harassing Songbu. More than 3,000 people from the Communist Army's Jianghan Column on both sides of the railway line invaded Yunmeng this afternoon. Their vanguard force of more than 600 people once sneaked to 20 li north of the county seat. They were repelled by the National Army firing cannons. The Communist troops still lingered in the area between Anlu and Yunmeng until late at night.

[Central News Agency Hankou Dispatch, 8th] Military news: (1) Our Yingshan Xishui Self-Defense Force and the pacification regiment of the Second Special Office are currently engaged in fierce battles with the Communist army entrenched in Xishui.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 8th] Military News Agency report: The outskirts of Anqing are still silent.

### President He Returns to the Capital; Exhorted Colleagues Before Leaving Guangzhou; Striving to Serve the Public and Strengthen Administrative Efficiency

Huang Shaogu, Secretary of the Executive Yuan, Deputy Director Jia Jingde, Economic Minister Sun Yueqi, Defense Minister Xu Yongchang, and Duanmu Jie all went to the airport to greet him.

He promised to consider it. At 9 a.m., he held a tea party at the Yingbin Hotel to entertain the members of the Legislative and Supervisory Committees in Guangzhou and the members of the Kuomintang Central Committee to exchange opinions. At 10:10 a.m., he summoned officials above the director level at the office of the Executive Yuan to give instructions, saying briefly: At this difficult time for the country, all staff must be patient, work hard to serve the public, and strengthen administrative efficiency. In the future, the focus of the Executive Yuan's political affairs will be in Beijing, and affairs will be in Guangzhou, but we will try our best to keep it in contact.

### Central Standing Committee Reviewed Government's Diplomatic Policy; Consistent Policy Should Absolutely Not Have Any Changes; Government Will Form Peace Guidance Committee

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 7th] (Delayed) After the Central Political Committee meeting on the 7th, a one-person-at-a-time Central Standing Committee meeting was held immediately. First, Premier He Yingqin reported on military affairs, including the Communist army's attack on the southern section of the Pinghan Road and the situation in Anqing and Yizheng. He also reported on the situation of the government representatives after arriving in Beiping for several days and the financial situation. Then, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ye Gongchao reported on the international situation. In general, the Communist army's offensive was given importance. There was a heated discussion at the meeting, which generally believed that after the peace talks, both sides should immediately cease fire to avoid the people suffering from war again. It was generally hoped that the Communist Party could accept the government's ceasefire proposal to show sincerity in the peace talks. At the same time, the government's diplomatic policy was also carefully reviewed, and it was generally believed that since the War of Resistance Against Japan, cooperation with all democratic countries in the international community, participation in the United Nations organization, and joint efforts for world peace have been very appropriate. This consistent diplomatic policy should absolutely not have any changes. Therefore, although the Central Political Committee gave post-recognition to the foreign minister of Chuan Bingchang, it was by no means the government changing its diplomatic policy. After the meeting, there was much discussion about the recent CCP broadcasts advocating uniting the people of the country and preparing to participate in the Soviet Union's group operations, which was considered a complete violation of the people's desire for peace. Finally, the members exchanged opinions on the peace talks issue until the meeting adjourned at 6 p.m. The detailed content could not be learned, but it was heard that the key to the success of the peace talks would be whether the Communist army was willing to cease fire and whether it still wanted to cross the Yangtze River. It was also heard that the government would form a peace guidance committee based on this principle, so that the peace representatives could consult at any time for instructions.

### Editorial: Revisions to the Financial and Economic Reform Plan

The revised version of the financial and economic reform plan has been sent to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process. After reading the revised reform plan, we have generally gained an outline of the financial and economic policies of the new Minister of Finance, Liu Gongyun.

The content of the financial and economic policies still follows the old path of Xu Keting's new financial and economic reform plan, but there are also significant differences, namely in the following points: (1) The national treasury will no longer subsidize transportation and public utilities; (2) Establish a "tax unit" system, with each tax unit equivalent to one fen of gold in the market system, to be purchased with gold yuan notes; (3) Prepare for property tax; (4) Appropriately handle production loans; (5) Implement cost-of-living index deposits or other value-guaranteed deposits. Now we will examine each of these points separately.

The government subsidy policy was implemented most widely and effectively in wartime Britain. At that time, Britain lacked resources and had to make every effort to increase production and compete for imported materials. The extra costs paid for competing for production and purchase should not be included in the Jia price, making it unaffordable for those with low incomes. Therefore, a subsidy system was implemented. As for our country, the current situation of subsidizing transportation and public utilities cannot be compared with that of Britain. According to the scope of subsidies in our country, there are postal and telecommunications, railways, airplanes, ships, highway passenger cars, buses, telephones, trams, electricity, gas, ferries, tap water, etc. Although some of the classes enjoying these services are truly people with low incomes and heavy burdens (especially public school teachers), airplanes, gas, telegrams, telephones, and first and second class tickets for railways and ships are mostly enjoyed by people in the middle class and above. If we still want to use the blood and sweat of ordinary people living in poverty to subsidize their enjoyment, of course we will feel guilty! Therefore, we strongly agree with abolishing the subsidy system and achieving self-sufficiency for each unit. However, when the departments in charge of transportation and public utilities are setting fee standards, it is best to increase the burden on first-class enjoyment and subsidize ordinary people with low-level enjoyment, so that the majority of people can have the opportunity to enjoy transportation and public utilities.

Secondly, let's talk about the "tax unit" issue. This is a new system that stipulates that each unit is equivalent to one fen of gold and is used exclusively for paying taxes. This has the same effect as using "customs yuan" to pay import taxes, but it has a greater impact on the lives of the people. Because imported goods are not enjoyed by ordinary people, the impact on people's lives from calculating and paying with "customs yuan" is still small. However, if all taxes are paid entirely with "tax units," then it may not be affordable for people below the middle class! Although the business community still has room to pass on the cost, how can the salary class and ordinary people who receive gold yuan notes every month endure it? Of course, national taxes should be "accurate," but if they do not consider the ability of the people to bear them, then there is no difference from "killing the chicken to get the eggs." The result will still be to create more poverty and social unrest, which is definitely not an appropriate solution. Moreover, the property tax is still in the "preparation" stage. We strongly hope that the authorities can quickly show their courage and adhere to the fair principle of "those with money should contribute money," and not let the many wealthy people "evade" their tax obligations, leaving the burden entirely on the ordinary people.

Again, regarding the implementation of cost-of-living index deposits or other value-guaranteed deposits, we believe that the former is definitely not a good opportunity at present. People still vividly remember the stimulus of forcibly deducting 40% of their gold savings in the past, and fair and reasonable solutions for the repayment methods of pre-war deposits and public bonds have not yet been obtained. If these many prerequisites cannot be eliminated, I am afraid that people will definitely not easily take the bait. Furthermore, the words "cost of living index" may not have a good impression on the people. The cost of living index currently compiled specifically for public school teachers is entirely under the control of the government, which is already well known. And isn't the cost of living index for workers in various places also subject to technical calculation problems, often leading to labor unrest? Therefore, in this environment, it is absolutely not easy to get the support of the people when it comes to handling cost-of-living index deposits. As for the latter, which is the widely rumored silver dollar deposit, although we dare not place too much extravagant hope on silver dollar deposits, it is clearly much more concrete than the former, because (1) the impression of silver dollars among the people is extremely profound and widespread, and transactions in various places already use silver dollars as a bargaining chip; (2) the silver dollar unit is similar to the purchasing power of each yuan before the war, and receipts and payments are extremely flexible; (3) silver dollars have a public market and price, which is definitely not as abstract as the price index; (4) banks in Lanzhou, Kunming, and Changsha have widely implemented silver dollar deposit and loan businesses, and the government expenses of Fuzhou and Hunan provinces and cities also use silver dollars as the unit. If the government can adapt to the abuse of liquidity at present and change with the times, then handling silver dollar deposits will obviously help the current economic policy. However, what is worrying is that most bankers are showing a timid attitude for the sake of their own interests.

Finally, we contributed eight principles to the opinion on the appropriate handling of production loans in the editorial of this newspaper on the 31st of last month, hoping that the authorities can carefully consider them. We do not hope that this production loan is only to perfunctorily meet the requirements of a few industrial capitalists, nor do we hope for a "mere formality" loan clause. We hope that after handling the loan, it can truly help legitimate production businesses, so that it can achieve the effect of increasing materials and stabilizing prices, and fully achieve the spirit of the loan.

In summary, we believe that the current financial and economic policies should have a concrete plan, and it is absolutely impossible to treat the head when it hurts and the feet when they hurt. The policy must especially focus on the practical spirit, so as to obtain the greatest effectiveness. In today's situation where the government's financial and economic policies have lost the hearts of the people and lost credibility, the authorities should promptly handle silver dollar deposits as a basis for restoring credibility and winning back the hearts of the people, thereby laying a new foundation for finance.

### Report on Simplifying Provincial Administrative Institutions; Legislative Yuan Decides to Remand for Review; Fierce Debate Arises on Reforms to the Banking System and Other Proposals

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 8th] The twelfth meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan was held at 9:30 am on the 8th, presided over by Tong Guanxian. Reporting items: The Executive Yuan consulted on the draft of the Organizational Law of the Executive Yuan's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, which was decided to be jointly reviewed by the Legislative Committee and the Financial and Economic Committee. The Executive Yuan consulted on the draft revision of the Organizational Law of the Ministry of Interior, which was decided to be jointly reviewed by the Interior and Local Autonomy Committee and the Legislative Committee, and each of the Labor, Land Administration, Social Affairs, and Health Committees was requested to recommend one member to participate. The Executive Yuan consulted on the proposed draft revision of the Financial and Economic Reform Plan. A request for investigation and review was made, and it was decided to be reviewed by the Financial and Economic Committee. Matters for discussion: First, the review report on simplifying provincial administrative institutions was discussed. Various legislators spoke one after another, and opinions differed. Finally, it was decided to remand the matter to the Interior and Local Autonomy Committee and the Legislative Committee for review, and to submit it to the Yuan meeting for discussion within one week. Wang Dingsheng and others proposed that the Postal Law and the Law on the Management of State-Owned Enterprises were contradictory, and proposed revising the Postal Law. It was resolved to follow the opinion of the Procedural Committee and jointly review it by the Transportation Committee and the Legislative Committee. Then, the proposal by Wang Lihang was discussed, stating that the current national administrative bureaus and treasury agencies are large, their operations are redundant, their expenses are huge, their organizations are extremely unreasonable, and they have the most significant impact on the national economy, people's livelihood, finance, and prices. A method for reforming national financial institutions, thoroughly reorganizing the administrative bureaus and treasury agencies, establishing a legal banking system, eradicating the control of powerful families and compradors, saving the crisis of economic collapse, and rescuing the starving and freezing people was specially proposed. The original text of the proposal was very long, and the reading time was too long. It was already close to noon, and it was decided to continue the discussion in the afternoon. The meeting adjourned at 12 o'clock.

The meeting continued at 3:30 pm, and the proposal by Wang Lihang to reorganize national administrative treasury agencies and the proposal by Wu Shipeng and others to reform the banking system in order to promote the development of the national economy and people's livelihood were discussed together. After a long debate, it was decided to submit the cases separately to the Financial and Economic Committee and the Legislative Committee for joint review. The proposal by Shu Yunchang and others to strongly request the abolition of the Import and Export Management Committee in order to simplify the administration and save public funds was presented. When the legislators spoke, they almost all agreed to abolish it. It was decided to submit it to the Economic Resources Committee, the Financial and Economic Committee, and the Legislative Committee for joint review. The meeting adjourned at 6 o'clock.

### Intense Debate on Financial Proposals

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 8th] Wang Lihang's proposal to reform national financial institutions and thoroughly reorganize national administrative treasury agencies and Wu Shipeng's proposal to reform the banking system were submitted for discussion at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the afternoon of the 8th, causing a fierce debate. The original proposers and most legislators expressed dissatisfaction with the malpractices and financial manipulations of national administrative treasury agencies over the years, and all advocated that they should be thoroughly reformed. Zhong Zhaoxiang, based on facts and theories, believed that the various national administrative bureaus had their value of existence, and put forward the opposite opinion, causing a fierce debate in the meeting. During the discussion, the proposers Wang Lihang and Wu Shipeng first explained the reasons and opinions for the proposal, arguing that it should be discussed and completed within a limited time and should not be delayed any further. After Wang and Wu finished their explanations, Liang Dong first spoke, saying that the crimes of the national administrative bureaus were well known: (1) the expenditures of the national administrative bureaus were not subject to the national budget; (2) the personnel of the national administrative bureaus were not subject to the personnel selection of the Ministry of Personnel; (3) the accounts of the national administrative bureaus were not submitted to the Audit Department; (4) the institutions of the national administrative bureaus did not belong to the Ministry of Finance, and their actions were mostly to hoard and speculate, manipulate finance, and everything was controlled by imperial relatives and wealthy households. If they were not thoroughly reformed, then the country, the government, and the people would have no hope. Zhong Zhaoxiang believed that the dissatisfaction with financial institutions was universally felt, but there were four factors that could affect finance: (1) financial policy; (2) financial system; (3) personnel and management; (4) external factors. When we examine financial institutions, we should proceed according to the four factors, and should not generalize the rest with only one factor. Legislator Wang blamed the corruption of financial institutions all on the system, which actually overlooked other factors. The current trend of world finance is toward specialization. The Soviet Union also implements a specialized banking system. Therefore, Legislator Wang's proposal for diversification is actually inconsistent with today's trend. He argued that the above-mentioned basic views should be based on when reviewing this case, and the claim in the Wang proposal to abolish commercial banks is tantamount to denying the existence of industry and commerce, and hoarding and other phenomena are also mostly due to external factors and should not be abandoned because of choking. As soon as Zhong Zhaoxiang finished speaking, Wang Lihang stood up again and shouted, "We must show the identity of the legislators and not speak for the capitalists," and believed that the four points mentioned by Legislator Zhong were actually only one point, namely the financial system problem, and asked, "What kind of system are our national administrative bureaus?" Miao Qiping spoke after Wang, and he excitedly shouted: "Our blood has been sucked dry by the national administrative bureaus. If we don't thoroughly reform, everything will be hopeless." Liu Quanzhong expressed his support for Wang's proposal, but argued that there should be some amendments. At this point, President Tong immediately stood up and proposed to submit the case for review. Before he finished speaking, Wang Lihang angrily pointed at President Tong and said: "Chairman, I want to give you a serious warning. Every time we discuss this case, you say submit it for review. Could it be that you have dealings with the banking sector?" Afterwards, Zhang Jingma proposed that the two cases be submitted for review separately, which was passed without objection.

Eleven representatives from the Shanghai shipping and business circles were also invited to attend, reporting on their views on navigation and exchange of goods. Wei Wenhun first spoke, reporting on the technical problems of navigation and requesting the passage of the North-South navigation plan. At the same time, he requested the restoration of passenger transport, hoping that the government would help the shipping industry restore the opening of the Beiyang Line, so as to prevent the Hong Kong shipping industry from seizing the navigation benefits of Beiyang. Wei also estimated that the Beiyang Line would need about 50,000 tons of ships, requiring thirty ships of 1,000 to 3,000 tons. He hoped that the government would approve the commencement of navigation immediately, and allow representatives from business circles to quickly go north. Representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and industry also emphasized that if North-South navigation could not be opened soon, Shanghai's industry and commerce would be affected. Then, the various shipping representatives left, and Deputy Premier Jia continued to preside over the meeting and conduct the review. The meeting adjourned at around 6 pm.

### Gradual Merger of the Three Occupation Zones in West Germany; the US, UK, and France Sign an Agreement; the West German Government to be Established Within Sixty Days; Approved to Participate in the Marshall Plan Assistance Zone

[Reuters, Washington, 8th] After several discussions on the West German issue, the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, Bevin, Acheson, and Schuman, signed the formal agreement of the three countries on West Germany today. The content has been announced simultaneously today in London, Washington, Paris, and Berlin. The main points are as follows:

(1) The full planning of the administration of the merger zone of the United Kingdom and the United States and the French zone in West Germany, as well as the gradual removal of the boundaries between the three occupation zones in West Germany. (2) The establishment of a West German country within the next two months. (3) The trend towards consistency in military responsibilities among the three occupying forces in West Germany. (4) The continuation of the British and American airlift system to supply Berlin, and the use of air stations in the French zone if necessary. (5) The overall planning of trade among the three zones of West Germany and with foreign countries. (6) Recognizing West Germany as a member of the Atlantic Pact.

This agreement is a major step towards the realization of West Germany. The important significance of this agreement to the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg has been jointly notified by the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. The State Department spokesman specifically pointed out the characteristic of the rapid establishment of the agreement, and believed that under normal circumstances, the negotiation of the agreement must take a considerable amount of time, and it is likely to be signed in late May. The reason why it was able to be established quickly is due to the establishment of the Atlantic Pact and the rapid deterioration of the international situation. British officials also acknowledged that the rapid establishment of the agreement shows the important role of the Atlantic Pact in international relations. In the future, the development of Europe will regard the Atlantic Pact as its key, and the agreement reached by the three zones on West Germany will undoubtedly be a pioneer in building other agreements among Western countries.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 8th] Paris Evening News claims that the agreement on the German issue between the three countries will stipulate: (1) Merge the occupation zones of the three countries before July. (2) Establish a semi-federal national government before the autumn. (3) Allow German representatives to participate in the Marshall Plan Committee. (4) France has the right to participate in the meeting of senior officials of member states. (5) France has the right to veto all major decisions.

[Our Report] Washington, 8th Radio: After explaining the various problems of Germany after the war, British Foreign Secretary Bevin said that we have reached a certain stage, and we can take other steps in the future. If the Germans are wise, they should react well to it, and they should remember that they caused two world wars. The three governments are providing assistance to Germany so that it can become a truly democratic country, and other countries in the world can live in peace. Hoffman and Army Secretary Royal were present to participate in the discussion when the West German occupation regulations were finalized today. The American garrison in Germany can order Clay to return home with great interest, and will still resign from the war. The most popular candidates for the successor are Wedemeyer and Clark, but both Wedemeyer and Clark have stated that they are unwilling to take up this war.

[Reuters, Washington, 8th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin, after completing the task of signing the Atlantic Pact and the West German Agreement here, is scheduled to leave here today for New York to catch the British mail ship "Mauritania" back home.

### The US Government Replies to Eight Western European Countries, Promising to Provide Military Assistance, Determined to Make its Utmost Efforts to Make the Alliance Effective

[Reuters, Washington, 8th] The US government has formally replied today to the five Western European Union countries and Italy, Norway, and Denmark, promising to violate the Congress of the United States to approve military assistance to them to make the Atlantic Pact effective, and requesting the five Western European countries to submit detailed figures of the type of weapons as soon as possible. The US government's reply, written by Secretary of State Acheson, is in response to the request of Western European countries for emergency military assistance. In addition to promising to immediately ask Congress to approve military assistance, the reply also stated that the US government is determined to make its utmost efforts to achieve the purpose of providing military assistance to other countries in the Atlantic Pact.

Content of the Note from Eight Countries to the United States

[United Press, Washington, 8th] The joint note of the five Western European Union countries stated that the five countries have considered the "Common Defense Plan" and have reached the conclusion that "this defense plan must have the material assistance of the US government to be effective." The joint note listed the principles of the joint defense plan they have agreed upon as follows: (1) Self-help, mutual assistance, and joint action in defending against armed attacks; (2) Economic recovery has priority over military matters. They emphasized that their joint efforts are not enough to guarantee security, and "the material and financial assistance of the United States is urgently needed. Therefore, the signatories to the Brussels Treaty will submit a detailed list of specific military needs for 1949-50 at the earliest opportunity upon learning whether the government is preparing to assist them." The Italian note emphasized that Italy needs US military assistance to fulfill its joint defense obligations under the Atlantic Pact. The Danish note said the same. The Norwegian note stated that Norway cannot complete its military plans with its own resources. As for the requests of Canada, Portugal, and Iceland, it is expected to be revealed later.

### US Military Aid Program Requires Additional Funds; Truman Struggles with Congressmen

[United Press, Washington, 8th] President Truman is now entering a new struggle with a large number of congressmen over the military aid to Europe program. The President hinted that he would allocate military funds for aid to Europe in addition to the $15.9 billion defense budget, which aroused strong protests from Republican members of Congress and some Democratic members. Senate Republican leader Wyler said that if the President asks to continue to allocate funds, the treasury will inevitably suffer losses, otherwise taxes must be increased. Only by combining various foreign aid programs into one, cutting unnecessary expenses, and living within our means. Senate Finance Committee member George (Democrat) said that I think the military aid to Europe program cannot be separated from the defense program.

### Candidate for US Ambassador to the Soviet Union; Kirk is Expected to Succeed

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 7th] Well-informed sources said that President Truman intends to transfer Ambassador to Belgium Kirk to be Ambassador to the Soviet Union to succeed Smith. Mr. Kirk is a military expert and is familiar with Western European defense issues.

### Britain Clarifies its Attitude Towards Italian Territories, Advocating Individual Handling, Hoping that Cyrenaica Will Be Trusteeshiped by Britain

[United Press, Lake Success, 8th] The issue of dealing with former Italian colonies is still at a standstill after the UN Political Committee listened to conflicting proposals presented by the British and French representatives. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gromyko has not yet presented the Soviet Union's views.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 7th] British Minister of State and Chief Representative to the UN McNeil stated in the Political Committee today when discussing the former colonies that Britain favors individual handling of the former colonies. Therefore, it is not easy to have a general method that can be applied to all former Italian colonies. As far as Libya is concerned, the Four-Power Investigation Committee found that the political intentions of the residents of the area differ from place to place. Therefore, these lands must be handled individually, but this does not deny the appropriateness of the entire Libya area still being unified in the end. As far as Cyrenaica is concerned, if the United Nations agency hands the area over to British governance, Britain will faithfully fulfill its trusteeship responsibilities, and Britain will recognize Senussi as the head of the country as much as possible. Regarding Tripolitania, Britain has not yet been able to put forward practical suggestions, but Britain is also unwilling to be the governing authority of the area for a long time. McNeil continued to mention Italian Somaliland, advocating that the area be handed over to Italian governance under the trusteeship of the United Nations. Regarding Italian Eritrea, Britain advocates that it be ceded to Abyssinia to fulfill the legitimate and reasonable demands of the country.

### Submissions of Priests Abused by Hungary and Bulgaria Added to the UN Agenda; Comprehensive Committee Discusses the Indonesian Issue

[Reuters, Lake Success, 7th] The UN Comprehensive Committee decided today to add the case of Cardinal Mindszenty of Hungary and the trial of priests in Bulgaria to the UN agenda. Eleven countries voted in favor, the Soviet Union and Poland voted against, and Iran abstained. US representative Austin claimed that due to Soviet representative Malik's accusation that Wall Street was the background for defaming Hungary and Bulgaria, the Mindszenty case and other cases need to be discussed by the UN. Chinese representative Gu Weijun also said that the case has aroused worldwide concern and should be discussed by the UN. Malik pointed out that adding the two cases to the UN agenda is a violation of the Charter, and the UN agency will inevitably become a place for defamation, which will result in the reputation of the UN being tarnished. The priests of Mindszenty and Bulgaria are not only criminals in the country, but also instigators of a new world war. The people of the world should thank Hungary and Bulgaria for bringing them to justice. Polish representative Szukiewicz also said that adding the trial cases of Hungary and Bulgaria to the agenda will cause more hatred and anxiety. The UN Comprehensive Committee will discuss tomorrow the case proposed by India and Australia to add the Indonesian issue to the UN agenda.

### Measures for Purchasing and Storing Food Rice Decided; Grain Merchants Can Pledge Funds to National Banks; to be Implemented After Seeking the Approval of the Minister of Finance Today; the Rice Market Will Resume Free Transactions from Today

[Our Report] The Municipal Government convened a meeting on the purchase of food rice at 3 PM yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Room, based on the implementation measures for purchasing food rice decided by the Food Conference the day before yesterday. The participating units included the Central Bank, the Financial Administration Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, the North-South Rice Market, the Rice Merchants Association, and Tian Yushi, Director of the Land and Food Department of the Ministry of Finance. The implementation measures for purchasing pledge funds for the purchase and storage of rice were adopted as follows: (1) It was decided at the last meeting that the government would be responsible for 600,000 dan of food rice, and would purchase it from Southeast Asia. The foreign exchange required would be jointly requested by the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, and the Municipal Government to the Executive Yuan for assistance. (2) It was decided that the 600,000 dan of food rice that the rice merchants are responsible for would be purchased and pledged. The rice merchants can pledge the food rice to the National Bank and use the proceeds to purchase food rice. The above measures will be implemented by Secretary-General Chen and Director Tian of the Ministry of Finance after seeking the approval of Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun today.

[Our Report] Tian Yushi, Director of the Land and Food Department, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Nanjing to attend the food conference convened by the Municipal Government in order to raise funds for the people's food affairs in the city.

### 社局昨繼績舉行紡織工業座談會　原料起恐慌　銷路多呆滯　一致希望放寬工貸

[Report from this newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau yesterday continued to hold a symposium on the supply and demand of raw materials for the textile industry, attended by representatives of machine dyeing and weaving, towel blankets, handkerchiefs, knitwear, underwear, camel wool, handmade cotton weaving, and spinning yarn industries. Representatives from the ribbon weaving industry were absent. According to representatives from the machine dyeing and weaving industry, the raw materials required by the industry are cotton yarn, grey cloth, fuel (coal, diesel), and dyes (including chemical raw materials). Among these, fuel is the most alarming, followed by the source of dyes. Due to insufficient import quotas and extremely limited domestic supply, there is also a sense of panic. The industry's monthly raw material needs are: 20,000 pieces of cotton yarn, 1 million bolts of grey cloth, 25,000 tons of coal, 16,000 tons of diesel, and US$900,000 worth of dyes. The industry hopes that essential dyes will be allowed to be imported freely, exports of cloth will be encouraged, and industrial loans will be relaxed.

Towel Blankets

Industry representatives stated that the raw materials for their industry are yarn, dyes, chemicals, and fuel. Finished products cannot be sold in the China market, and the selling price in Southeast Asia is lower than the cost, so they deeply feel the lack of sales channels. Most raw materials rely on imports, and they are unable to settle foreign exchange due to the surge in the US dollar, making it impossible to transfer certificates. The industry hopes to expand the scope of industrial loans, simplify procedures, and use machine factory buildings as collateral.

Handkerchiefs

Industry representatives stated that the main raw material is cotton yarn, requiring 3,500 pieces of cotton yarn every five months. The recent difficulties faced by the industry are sluggish sales, shortage of funds, and high interest rates. The main sales market for handkerchiefs is the Nanyang Islands, where current selling prices are lower than the cost. The industry hopes that the government will purchase and export according to the cost, and requests government loans.

Underwear

Industry representatives stated that the raw materials for their industry are caustic soda, bleaching powder, sulfuric acid, and dyes. They need fine yarn of 60 counts or higher, which can only be manufactured by the Fang Jian and Shenxin No. 9 factories in China, which is far from sufficient. Imports from foreign countries are not allowed, so they feel very difficult. Secondly, there is also a great shortage of coal. The industry needs 1,000 pieces of fine yarn and 650 tons of coal per month.

Camel Wool

Industry representatives stated that the raw materials for their industry are wool and cotton yarn, with a monthly requirement of 300,000 pounds of wool and 250,000 pounds of cotton yarn. The difficulties they face are limited stock, shortage of funds, heavy pressure from high interest rates, and sharp rise in foreign exchange rates. They hope that the government will launch industrial loan to save the crisis.

Spinning Yarn

Industry representatives stated that the raw material is cotton yarn. If fully operational, they can produce 3,067 pieces. Currently, due to the lack of sales channels in other areas and the lack of goods for manufacturing in the local processing plants, 70% of the factories are in a state of semi-shutdown. They request the authorities to increase the allocation quantity and loans.

Handmade Cotton Weaving

Industry representatives stated that the raw materials are cotton yarn and dyes. Currently, 70% of the factories are in a state of semi-shutdown. The industry hopes for national material exchange and large-scale industrial loans.

Today, a symposium on the supply and demand of raw materials for the chemical industry group will continue to be held. Those invited to attend will include the Dye Industry Association, household chemical product industry, chemical raw material industry, match industry, glass industry, and paper industry.

### 市商會電請財政部　放寬票據抵用禁令

[Report from this newspaper] The City Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the ban on using bills for offsetting on the same day be relaxed. The telegram stated: To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, according to a letter from the Fish Business Association of this city, it has been found that the financial authorities in this city recently suddenly announced a ban on using bills for offsetting on the same day, and usury has reached unprecedented levels, causing all industries and markets to stagnate and the financial situation to be extremely chaotic, causing unbearable suffering to all industries. The association, based on complaints from its member firms, convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors, who believed that the situation was dire and that if no remedial measures were taken quickly, the city's industry and commerce would face the risk of closing down completely. It was decided to write to the Chamber of Commerce to promptly develop countermeasures to alleviate commercial difficulties. At the same time, other industries have also come to the association to complain about the above situation. It has been found that cash is extremely scarce recently. The Central Bank can only provide commercial firms with 12% of their deposit withdrawals in cash and 8% in fixed-amount banknotes. Commercial firms then issue these amounts to their customers. That is, those in industry and commerce who have dealings with firms, even if they have sufficient funds deposited in the firms, can only obtain 20% of what they need. Under these circumstances, industry and commerce urgently need to issue bills based on their actual funds as a means of payment. Now, in this severe situation, thoroughly implementing the ban on not using them for offsetting on the same day is tantamount to strangling the throat of industry and commerce and putting them to death. The current tense situation, when industry and commerce are closing their doors and waiting for exhaustion, is different from the situation when the ban on using bills for offsetting on the same day was promulgated last year. Government should act according to the times, and how can we adhere to the old decree and not leave some leeway for industry and commerce? It is requested that the Ministry instruct the Shanghai Financial Administration to allow flexibility in the use of bills for offsetting by commercial firms, not to impose an extreme prohibition, and to allow each firm to carefully handle the matter based on the circumstances of its customers. In addition to the 27 reasons stipulated for dishonoring bills, it is also necessary to prevent them from creating excuses and dishonoring bills arbitrarily. At the same time, strict sanctions should be imposed on customers who issue bills to maintain bill credit, so that industry and commerce can still have access to turnover. In recent years, floating capital has been dispersed, and commercial firms have been unable to meet the needs of industry and commerce due to their weak capital. The Central Bank has also failed to fulfill its responsibility as a bank's bank, so that when industry and commerce have needs, the interest on each yuan of loan is at the highest level, two or three times higher than the interbank lending rate. Drinking poison is not voluntary, but is forced by the situation. The Ministry must negotiate with the Central Bank to fulfill its responsibility as a bank's bank and provide commercial firms with sufficient funds so that interbank lending rates can gradually fall back and market interest rates will not become rampant. In order to alleviate the suffering of industry and commerce, we humbly offer our humble opinions and respectfully request the Ministry to examine and adopt them. Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce kowtows.

### 三毛畫展花絮追記　監委感動願意宣傳　教授之女無錢出力

The "San Mao's Life in Paintings" exhibition, sponsored by the China Welfare Fund, had an unexpectedly crowded opening day on Children's Day, and the order was somewhat chaotic. The staff at the venue were all sweating profusely.

Several paintings were squeezed down, causing the author of San Mao, Zhang Leping, to jump up and down in a panic.

At 2:30 PM, Wang Xiaolai arrived and held up the Yibao watercolor painting, but was imprisoned in the crowd by the audience.

The famous drama actress Ms. Yin Qing sympathized with San Mao and volunteered to do the voice-over at the venue. Her Beijing accent was pleasant and moving.

The voice-over was fruitful. Two young brothers, eight or nine years old, automatically joined the "San Mao Paradise Association" to become friends of "San Mao".

It was difficult for reporters from various newspapers to move around in the crowd. The photographers were afraid of squeezing their cameras and raised their hands high, looking for lenses, like strongmen performing weightlifting.

On the second day of the art exhibition, although there were many viewers, the order had improved. Zhang Leping sat down leisurely, with a faint smile on his face.

One of the viewers, Hu Dalin, adopted four "San Mao". He had four sons, and each son helped one "San Mao". It is hoped that he will have a few more sons so that he can become an honorary member.

Greedy to watch San Mao, forgot his son

San Mao's paintings are indeed fascinating. One gentleman forgot his son while watching them.

Ms. Yin Qing reported to the audience, please claim the lost children, the effect was particularly good, someone came to claim them within seconds, and the poor San Mao present looked extremely envious.

Ms. Zhou Dengmanwen automatically joined the San Mao Paradise Association as a friend of "San Mao", buying two volumes of San Mao's Wanderings on the spot with one silver dollar, and declaring that she would recruit members for the association.

The third day of the art exhibition had more viewers than the second day.

Someone picked up a small coat and handed it to the information desk. Ms. Yin Qing mistakenly thought it was donated to the association and immediately wrote a receipt.

One viewer brought a large package of old clothes to the venue to donate to the poor San Mao.

The loudspeaker reported that the Shen Bao news column had received a message of donation from reader Mr. Gao Cide, which moved the audience.

Bank colleagues, joint membership

On the fourth day of the art exhibition, twelve colleagues from a certain bank jointly assisted three San Mao every month, becoming three ordinary members together.

After viewing, Supervisory Committee member Liu Pingjiang was moved and purchased a copy of San Mao's Wanderings for resale for 10,000 yuan, and was willing to promote the San Mao Paradise Association and solicit members.

A friend Wang sent a package of pencils and exercise books to be a friend of San Mao.

The daughter of a professor from Jiaotong University came to the venue to volunteer to help. She said that her father was a poor professor, and she had no strength to donate money, but was willing to contribute her labor, and her eyes were red. It was truly touching.

Mr. Jiang, the manager of a certain company, lingered in front of the charity paintings for a long time, unwilling to leave. As a result, he ordered them for 5 million yuan, got the painting he loved, and saved the suffering San Mao.

The fifth day of the art exhibition was still a great success. The first San Mao sympathizer was a foreign lady, Ms. Kai, from Jardine Matheson, who spent one million yuan to order a charity painting and was willing to help solicit members. There have been four people who have ordered the painting before and after.

Far from the target, hoping to join hands in charity

Students from Jiangwan Middle School donated a sum of money collectively after visiting the venue.

It is reported that more than 200 people have joined the San Mao Paradise Association as San Mao members in recent days, and about 200 San Mao have been adopted. The association's target is to rescue 500 "San Mao" before the end of this month, and the current results are still far from the target. Judging from the grand occasion of the art exhibition in the past five days, Zhang Leping's San Mao can get such widespread sympathy, and it is believed that tens of thousands of suffering San Mao in Shanghai will surely get more widespread sympathy. The China Welfare Fund has established the San Mao Paradise Association for these suffering San Mao and is publicly soliciting members. The monthly membership fee for ordinary members is equivalent to three silver dollars in gold yuan notes, which can rescue one San Mao. If you can rescue five or more San Mao every month, you are an honorary member. If you can donate materials and money in irregular amounts at any time, you are a "San Mao" friend. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will actively participate and join hands in charity. The address of the San Mao Paradise Association is No. 9806-7, Central Lin Sen Road.

### 皇後戲院觀劇糾紛　憲兵機警未肇禍端

[Report from this newspaper] At the Queen's Theater on Xizang Road at about 2:15 PM yesterday, five soldiers wanted to enter the theater to watch a play. The theater explained that the reception for soldiers was in the morning, the time had passed, and it was already full, so they could not be entertained and asked for forgiveness, but to no avail. They reported to the military police stationed in the theater, and squad leader Zhang Zicheng advised them gently. Unexpectedly, one of the soldiers took off two hand grenades and put them in his military pants pockets. After a while, he took out one and was about to throw it. Fortunately, squad leader Zhang was alert and immediately stepped forward and hugged him around the waist, preventing the disaster. At that time, the military police fired five shots into the air to deter the mob and arrested four people on the spot, including Huang Junjie (the one who intended to throw the grenade, 20 years old, from Sichuan), Wei Deqing (19 years old, from Sichuan), Chen Ruifu (24 years old, from Sichuan), and Zhu Yunfei (18 years old, from Sichuan). Another person escaped. The above four people were taken to the Penglai Road Military Police Team in Nanshi for interrogation and then sent to the Garrison Command for punishment.

### The Jinji Lake Drowning Case: Confusing and Unpredictable, The Truth is Revealed, Four Criminals Executed

— Yang Xiu Kou

[Our Suzhou Report, 5th] On the evening of January 1st of this year, a bloody murder and robbery occurred at Jinji Lake outside the Fengmen Gate here. A fishing boat was robbed, and the four men and women on board were strangled to death by the robbers and their bodies dumped into the lake. Afterward, the criminal police team conducted extensive investigations and arrested the main culprit, Sun Fulou, and three others. After a thorough interrogation, all the criminals confessed. Just as the authorities were preparing to impose the death penalty, a man named Zhang Shizi surrendered to the District Court, claiming that the real culprits were not Sun Fulou and others, but rather Wang Zhaomin and Li Tongfa, who were informants for the criminal police. This led to the overturning of the entire case. However, during the court hearing, Zhang Shizi recanted his previous confession, creating a confusing and unpredictable situation that shocked the entire Wu region. During the final court session on the 1st of this month, the audience was packed, all eager to see the faces of these murderers. The details of the case from beginning to end are recorded below:

Six people, Zhang Xinsheng, Wang A'er, Zhu Boqing, Yao Ximing, Zhu Fusheng, and Zhen Liansheng, who resided outside the Fengmen Gate and made a living by jointly operating a fish and shrimp business, frequently traveled between Suzhou and Hankou. On New Year's Day, they purchased over 20 catties of fresh fish and 280 catties of shrimp, worth over 10,000 gold yuan, from Renchang Firm at No. 17 Chaotian Road outside the Fengmen Gate. They packed the goods into four rattan baskets and had Li Jinnan's wooden boat load them. Shareholders Zhang Xinsheng and Wang A'er were responsible for escorting the goods to Suzhou Railway Station for transshipment to Shanghai for sale. The boat owner, assisted by his wife's younger sister, Xu Linmei, rowed the boat. The boat departed around 6 PM, but it did not return the next day. The mother of the boat owner, Li Jinnan, went to Renchang Fish Firm to inquire, but they also had no news. So, she searched everywhere until January 3rd, when she found the boat, which had set out on New Year's Day, near Jiangxiang River along Jinji Lake. Only three hats and a pair of women's shoes were left on board. The whereabouts of the boat owner Li Nannan, Xu Linmei, and the fish merchants Zhang Xinsheng and Wang A'er were unknown. Sensing something was amiss, she returned to the fish firm to report. The firm immediately hired employees to inspect Jinji Lake. According to nearby residents, fishermen had discovered a heavy object while fishing two days prior. Thinking it was a large fish, they hooked it up, only to find four human corpses. The boatmen were shocked and dared not speak out for fear of getting involved. They threw the bodies back into the water. When the shareholders of the fish business, Zhu Boqing, and others learned of this, they hired boats to search for a day on the 4th, but found nothing. On the 5th, they hired more boats and used grappling hooks. Around 2 PM, they finally pulled up two corpses in the lake, identifying them as Zhang Xinsheng and Wang A'er, the fish merchants who had been escorting the goods. The faces of the two corpses were swollen and purple, with scratches from hands. Their entire bodies were bound with hemp ropes, and their necks were also tightly strangled with hemp ropes. The sight was gruesome, indicating that they had been strangled to death and their bodies dumped to cover up the crime. On the 7th, the search continued, and the bodies of Li Jinnan and Xu Linmei were also recovered. These two corpses were in even worse condition than the previous two, being bound together. After the incident, on the 8th, detectives obtained leads and, accompanied by informants Wang Zhaomin and Li Tongfa, went to the countryside and arrested the main suspects Sun Jinxing (Kou Mei), Sun Xiaomei, and Wu Jinxiang, all migrants from Shandong, in Weiting Zhengyi. There were still accomplices in Chefang and Jiaozhi. The criminal police set out again to investigate and arrest, and on the 9th, they arrested Sun Fulou, who had initiated the crime. There were still accomplices, Tang Liansheng and Sun Xingtao, who had not been apprehended. The four criminals were extremely cunning and refused to reveal the truth. So, Team Leader Su Gengsheng devised a plan, ordering the criminal police to take Sun Koumei to the vacant lot in the back garden, order him to lie face down on the ground, cover him with old cotton clothes to fake his death, and fire two shots into the ground. Afterward, Sun Xiaomei and Wu Jinxiang were brought in and told that the Sun had been executed on orders. Upon seeing this, the three criminals trembled all over and confessed to the entire crime, admitting that during the robbery, Sun and others recognized Zhang Xinsheng and others, so they intended to silence them. Based on the confession, the criminal police immediately took the criminals to the countryside to retrieve the original items, such as leather robes. At this point, the entire case was brought to light. Police Chief Wu believed that the four criminals had committed heinous crimes and decided to impose the death penalty, intending to report to the First Pacification Zone Headquarters for approval before executing them by firing squad to appease public outrage.

Unexpectedly, on February 18th, a major change occurred in the case. The wives of the four criminals, Sun Yangshi and Sun Daishi, jointly submitted petitions to the County Council, the Police Department, the Court, and other agencies, appealing for justice, claiming that Sun Fulou and others had been falsely accused and wrongly imprisoned. The main culprits in the case were the informants Wang Zhaomin and Li Tongfa, who had private feuds and were using this as revenge by falsely implicating them. They claimed that after Sun and others were arrested, Wang Zhaomin, along with Wang Laoer, who claimed to be a criminal police officer, and Li Tongfa had repeatedly raped Sun Daishi, Sun Yangshi, and others. They requested that the court interrogate Sun and others. On the same day, another boatman, Zhang Shizi, surrendered to the District Prosecutor's Office, claiming that the four criminals arrested by the criminal police team were innocent and that the real criminals were indeed Wang Zhaomin, Li Tongfa, and three other unnamed people. Because Zhang Shizi was taken by them to row the boat that day. After questioning by Prosecutor Pan, he was temporarily detained. Because it was exactly the opposite of the previous case, he immediately telegraphed the criminal police team to bring Wang and Li to investigate the case. According to Li Tongfa: "I have always had a good relationship with Sun Xiaomei. In the first month of the lunar calendar last year, I borrowed 400 gold yuan from Sun. Sun said he didn't have any money on hand. On the seventh day of the month, Sun Xiaomei borrowed me 400 yuan. On the eleventh day, when I returned the money to Sun, Sun said that the money didn't need to be repaid. Recently, a batch of fresh shrimp was sold, and I had plenty of money in hand. At that time, I asked Sun why he always only caught fish, not shrimp, so why did he have shrimp to sell this time? He told me that he had opened a business in Jinji Lake, so I knew that Sun had done this case." This case was like a sudden rise of a strange peak, with twists and turns, making people feel confused and unpredictable, and it was difficult to distinguish right from wrong. Although there were several investigations, it was difficult to reveal the truth.

On March 7, the case was reopened for investigation, and there was a major development. When the prosecutor interrogated Zhang Shizi alone, Zhang said in his confession that after entering prison, Sun Yangshi and others did not pay him a penny for his life, so he gradually regretted it and revealed the truth. At this point, the confusing murder case was truly revealed.

The court immediately proceeded in three directions. Sun Fulou and six others (two are still at large) were prosecuted for robbery. Wang Zhaomin and Li Tongfa were prosecuted separately for the part of the case where they were accused of forced gang rape and disturbing public morals by Sun Tangshi. Zhang Shizi's false accusation was also prosecuted according to law. After two court hearings on March 31 and April 1, the case was declared closed due to conclusive evidence. On April 4, the verdict was announced: "Sun Koumei, Sun Xiaomei, Wu Jinxiang, and Sun Fulou jointly committed robbery and intentional homicide. Each is sentenced to death, with deprivation of civil rights for life."

After interrogation by Chen Honglu, the county magistrate and military judge, they were sentenced to death. The sentence was approved by the Provincial Garrison Headquarters. At 10 AM on the morning of the 7th, the two bandits were escorted to the open space at Beichengzha Bridge and executed by firing squad.

### The Spring Breeze Permeates Inside and Outside Suzhou City, Some Scenic Spots in the Suburbs Still Feel Like Walking on Thorns

— Our Special Correspondent Yang Wenyu

[Our Suzhou Report, 5th] Let's copy a cliché that describes Suzhou's scenic spots: "Suzhou is the capital of Wu during the Spring and Autumn Period, controlling the thoroughfare of three rivers and located at the confluence of five lakes. The mountains and rivers are beautiful, and the people are elegant and refined. Beside the city of King Wu, willows form embankments. In front of Qi Nu's gate, clear waves lap the shore. Thousands of beauties in green sleeves are up and down the buildings. Suzhou has always been full of beauties. Anchor at Maple Bridge to hear the midnight bell, climb Tiger Hill to listen to Master Sheng's Buddhist teachings, walk through the corridors of Lingyan Temple, and explore the fragrant snow plum blossoms of Dengwei. The eastern and western Dongting Islands are beautiful in Wu and Yue, enough to evoke distant thoughts and broaden the mind. Other famous gardens such as Canglang Pavilion, Lion Grove Garden, Liuyuan, and Yiyuan are all excellent." In just over a hundred words, it covers all of Suzhou's scenic spots and customs. However, these enticing and glamorous words can only be imagined, and you can no longer find them in today's Suzhou. But the reason why Suzhou can still attract countless ladies during the Spring and Autumn Festival, in my opinion, is simply because it has some grass, trees, mountains, and water, which seems to allow people who have lived in the city for a long time to come here to enjoy some freshness!

The rapid change in the war situation has made the once peaceful paradise of Jiangnan also smell the gunpowder. Therefore, the previous wave of fleeing, like an infectious disease, spread everywhere. Airplanes, ships, and trains were packed, and of course, Suzhou's only "freshness" that could maintain the seaside ladies was no longer something people had the leisure to enjoy. I remember at this time last year, people poured into Suzhou from the Beijing-Shanghai line like a tidal wave. The strangely dressed, willow-waisted, and crimson-lipped Shanghai-style women almost caused a revolution in the ancient Suzhou society, both crazy and stimulating. Streamlined cars drove on the few streets here, and Suzhou seemed to be a prisoner of the banknotes in their hands, a dazzling arrogance!

Travelers to Suzhou inevitably patronize a few shops here: Caizhiqi's melon seeds and candies, Ma Yongqi's soy sauce chicken and soy sauce duck, have a meal at Songhelou, and taste a bowl of noodles at Zhu Hongxing, as if it were a "compulsory course" in school. Therefore, for many years, these shops have regarded this business as the peak season of their annual operations. The sales of goods have no accurate statistics, but it is said that Zhu Hongxing Noodle Company has more small accounts than all the food restaurants in Suzhou. However, the situation today is very different from previous years. The Shanghai-style ladies with characteristic features are rarely found on the streets, and the car formation at the entrance of the restaurant has also disappeared from its former magnificence. Occasionally, some people do some embellishments, and rather than being eye-catching, it is more of a sorrow for the general businesses in Suzhou. On the other hand, a group of wealthy rural old women, wearing yellow cloth and carrying sachets, are everywhere. They go to Hangzhou, Changzhou Tianning Temple, Wuxi Chong'an Temple, or Pingwang Du Dui Lake. When they pass by Suzhou, they must visit Xuanmiao Temple. They only need to "kill a few heads" (silver dollars), and no one can be as carefree as them!

In recent centuries, countless temples and palaces have been added in Suzhou, and the number of gardens and residences is even more uncountable. Initially, these gardens were private properties set up by romantic scholars and local gentry for their own enjoyment. However, in recent years, they have all been opened for public viewing. Unfortunately, there are only people watching, but no one managing them. Moreover, due to frequent years of war and chaos, some are desolate, and some are dilapidated. Appreciation has become a lament. The lazy character of Suzhou people is fully expressed in these places. If desolation is also a kind of beauty, then you can go and see Liuyuan and Canglang Pavilion, with a few rotten wooden buildings and dilapidated balls. The design of Yiyuan is exquisite, but it has now been used as the campus of Henan University. In comparison, the strange architecture of Lion Grove Garden is still worth seeing because there is not much destruction. The sunny weather these days has filled the forest with groups of people going on spring outings.

In fact, the best places in Suzhou are all in the suburbs. However, many places already give people the feeling of walking on thorns. Exploring the plum blossoms of Dengwei should have been at the top of the itinerary, but half of the plum trees were destroyed by the Japanese. Now, a temporary middle school has been established on the nearby Xuanmu Mountain, and the cadre training class of Qiu Qingquan will soon be stationed on Qionglong Mountain. The green mountains remain the same, but the scenery is very different. In addition, since it is near Taihu Lake, public security is a major problem. Originally, there were several buses a day between Suzhou and Guangfu, but now there is only one left. Since transportation is inconvenient, tourists are also hesitant to go. Of course, there are plenty of people who can afford to hire a car, but it is necessary to consider whether the sightseeing is like an adventure. A friend told me that as long as the situation is calm, Guangfu and Dengwei are worth a trip in the season when yangmei are red and loquats are yellow. Lingyan Mountain, 25 miles west of the city, can be reached by car via Mudu in just half an hour. Although rickshaws can also go back and forth, the cost is three silver dollars. Some time ago, a group of people who took a horse-drawn carriage to visit Mudu encountered a robbery on the way back and lost a lot of money. It is said that the business of the popular Shijia Restaurant in Mudu is much worse than in previous years. As for Tianping Mountain, which is still west of Lingyan, although it has White Cloud Spring, Lotus Cave, and the towering strange rocks of the Tou Tuo Cliff on Feilai Peak for tourists to climb, the number of people going to Lingyan is much less than before, and it is undoubtedly worse to go to Tianping.

Su Dongpo said: "It is a shortcoming not to visit Tiger Hill when visiting Suzhou." "Geographical advantage" makes Tiger Hill a place that Suzhou women must visit today. Rickshaw drivers solicit business in front of the temple, and the words "Tiger Hill" are shouted the loudest. It is close to the city, and any car can be used. Moreover, there are many historical sites, and the guides can recite endlessly, such as the beginning and end of Tang Bohu's Three Smiles affair; the ruins of Bai Gongdi in the Tang Dynasty where cranes were raised; the ancient relics of the Six Dynasties such as Tiger Hill Pagoda, Sheng Gongtai, and Nodding Stone; and even the ruins of the Zhou and Qin dynasties such as Sword Pond and Sword Testing Stone, etc. Emperors of past dynasties have also visited it many times. In short, Tiger Hill never gives you boredom. Moreover, from an economic and convenient point of view, it is quite worthwhile. During the Qingming Festival, people going on spring outings are shoulder-to-shoulder on Tiger Hill Road, and it will crowd you dizzy. It is said that this grand occasion occurs every year. At the same time, dozens of fire engines go to Cuihuashanzhuang in Tiger Hill to sweep the public cemetery, which makes it even more lively. Vendors gather, forming a large market. Countless beggars follow tourists and refuse to let go. Flower girls use the soft language of Wu to pester you like toffee... There is a fun like attending a temple fair.

### The Silent Countryside of Nanxun

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng of This Newspaper

[Report from Hangzhou, May 5th by This Newspaper] Nanxun, a new poet, Xu Chi, once said in one of his articles: "Nanxun is a silent countryside. Silence and loneliness are unbearable." In its former history, Nanxun was extraordinarily glorious and prosperous. Starting from the late Qing Dynasty, it made a fortune by transporting official salt, and further earned money by running businesses in various places. Its silk was also famous internationally, bringing back a lot of foreign exchange. It simply became the richest town in the world. The big tycoons were known as "four elephants, eight oxen, and seventy-two scorched yellow dogs." Those whose assets were above one million silver dollars were only referred to as "one dog," and there were as many as seventy-two dogs.

Liu, Pang, Zhang, and Gu

The so-called "four elephants" refer to the four surnames: "Liu, Pang, Zhang, and Gu." In those years, in Nanxun, in addition to competing to build grand mansions, they also competed to build private gardens. For example, the Liu family built Xiaoyun Villa, with pavilions, terraces, towers, and various flowers. The Pang family then built Yi Garden, which was even larger than Xiaoyun Villa. The Zhang family, envious of the Pang family's Yi Garden, then built an even larger garden than the Pang family's. They put a lot of thought into naming it, and later came up with the two characters "Shi Yi" (Suitable Yi), with "Shi" above "Yi," hence the name "Shi Garden." The Gu family then also built a unique garden. The Liu family felt that their own Xiaoyun Villa was inferior, so they expanded it into "Nan Garden." There were as many as six private gardens in Nanxun due to this competition.

These many wealthy families, in addition to building houses for rent in the city to digest their swelling wealth, so the houses on both sides of Hengma Road and Tongfu Road near the famous Jing'an Temple Road in Shanghai were built solely by the Liu family, and the famous Huile Lane on Fourth Road was also built solely by the Liu family.

Watching Silkworms and Reeling Silk

Nanxun itself produces fish, sheep, chickens, and ducks in large quantities. The silk includes the famous Jili silk. The so-called "Jili" refers to a "Yang" (whirlpool). When water flows through seven "Yang," the water quality is naturally very clear. The silk produced there has round fibers and is tough. A single strand of silk can hold a copper coin and reach more than five feet in length. Speaking of Nanxun silk, as early as the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, people were watching silkworms and reeling silk. After the Taiping Rebellion, Wu and Li Songjun came to Nanxun, bringing mulberry seedlings and silkworm eggs to Japan to exchange for Kanei copper coins and kelp. In 1920, the United States specially organized a tourist group to visit Nanxun. At this time, all the silk was shipped to America via France. Later, French silk stockings became popular, with each dozen costing as much as 1,500 US dollars. The silk used for weaving stockings had to be uniform and clean. Nanxun mostly produced local silk, and the market was gradually taken over by Japanese silk. The best Japanese "White Tail Silkworm" breed came from Nanxun. Unfortunately, it is now lost in Nanxun. In the era when Nanxun silk was sold extensively overseas, the Mei brand silk produced by Mei Hengyu was famous internationally. Each dan (unit of weight) of Jili silk was worth 950 customs taels of silver, and even reached 990 taels, but this period was very short, and soon the price fell. During the peak sales period, exports amounted to tens of thousands of packages. Assuming the US silk market had ten shares, China occupied seven shares. Later, it fell to one-eighth, and each package was worth only 360 French francs, which was before 1937. Besides earning foreign exchange by selling silk, many people also made fortunes from producing silkworm eggs because the long-distance sales yielded substantial profits. (To be continued)

### Primary School Students Escort Lost Dog Home; Decline Reward and Donate to Charity

To Whom It May Concern,

My little dog was lost last night. I searched everywhere this morning without success. Feeling exhausted, I planned to rest at the Shanghai Grand Theatre. When I passed the Yiyuan Hotel, I saw three Chinese students leading the dog. I immediately went up to inquire. They said, "The dog was taken away by a beggar with a rope last night. We rescued the dog and found your address at the information office and planned to bring it to you." I was touched by their enthusiasm and wanted to thank them immediately, but they refused. Therefore, I am presenting 100,000 gold yuan to the Sanmao Children's Welfare Foundation (founded by Madame Sun and Mr. Zhang Leping). Please forward it on my behalf and publish this letter to express my highest gratitude to these three students.

Sincerely,

### The Price of Gold Rises All the Way; The National Bank Sells Unrestrictedly at a Price of 2.25 Million; Jewelry Gold Fluctuates Violently, Silver Shops Suspend Quotations in the Afternoon

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, the gold market gradually returned to normal, and settlements were made with current day banknotes and application forms. The opening in the morning was stable, at 1.89 million, slightly decreasing to 1.886 million. Midway, due to loose funds and frequent positive news, it rose all the way to 1.9001 million, reaching the upper limit again. Around noon, the Central Bank planned to sell a large amount of gold again, but only accepted banknotes or cash from the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank, which caused the industry to be unable to accept it. Trading stalled in the afternoon, and transactions came to a standstill again. More than ten large bars were traded in the morning, which was 20% higher than the previous day. Over-the-counter trading was brisk, and fluctuations were violent. Due to various rumors about crossing the river, people were uneasy. Various gangs had high morale, opening at 1.9 million, 1.95 million, once retreating to 1.88 million, 1.93 million, and then rising straight to 2.5 million, 2.55 million at the noon close. In the afternoon, the Central Bank sold without restrictions at a price of 2.25 million, secretly releasing 1,000 to 2,000 bars, and the upward trend slowed slightly. Opening at 2.4 million, 2.45 million, gradually declining to 2.21 million, 2.24 million, and closing slightly higher at 2.28 million, 2.31 million, an increase of 380,000 compared to the previous day. The overnight interest rate was increased by 260,000, and shouted as high as 2.44 million, 2.47 million.

[Report from the China News Agency] The gold market has not yet returned to normal since the Central Bank sold gold on the 4th. The reason is that gold shops are deeply afraid of the Central Bank's further malicious actions, so they are unwilling to trade in the market and have shifted the focus of transactions to over-the-counter, causing the market to come to a standstill. Active over-the-counter trading has had a significant impact on general prices. According to relevant sources, the Central Bank believes that over-the-counter trading is becoming rampant, disrupting the financial system, so it may carry out a considerable reorganization of the gold market to ensure that gold market transactions return to normal. It is said that this measure will be officially announced soon.

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, the price of gold jewelry in silver shops fluctuated violently, changing three times in the morning. At 10 o'clock, it was quoted at 1.85 million, 2.05 million; at 11 o'clock, it rose to 1.95 million, 2.15 million; and by noon, it was as high as 2.05 million, 2.25 million. In the afternoon, due to the chaotic market and brisk sales, there were few imports and many exports, and the supply and demand were out of balance, so all shops temporarily suspended quoting prices for business. It rose by 430,000 compared to the previous day, and silver jewelry also rose to 20,000, 25,000, an increase of 4,000.

### Silver Dollar Plunge

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday's silver dollar arbitrage had few transactions due to the low price of silver dollars in other ports, but it was still more cost-effective than gold yuan arbitrage. The gang sold out, and the remittance fee was directly over. Hankou sold out at 98 yuan, a premium of 2 yuan. Tianjin sold out US dollar remittances, at 1 yuan per 100 yuan. Due to price differences between the two places, silver dollar arbitrage was also done by exchanging silver dollars, with the other party taking US dollars, at a ratio of 2 yuan to 1. Although this arbitrage method is an innovative way to maintain the value of the currency, it is still done sporadically. Also, the remittance rate for silver dollar arbitrage in Wanxian was 96.75%.

Street trading fluctuated suddenly. It was still stable in the morning, with "big heads" (referring to a type of silver dollar) quoted at 34,000, 36,000. Around 10 o'clock, due to the sharp rise in gold prices and active demand, it quickly caught up and broke through four levels, reaching as high as 44,500, 45,500 near noon. Trading was chaotic in the afternoon, once reaching 49,000, 51,000. By evening, there were more floating profits, slightly lower at 44,000, 46,000. "Small heads" (another type of silver dollar) were quoted at 37,000, 39,000. Dragon and Eagle coins were quoted at 30,000, 32,000. For banknote trading, "big heads" once reached as high as 51,000, 53,000. In the afternoon, the overnight price was shouted down to 47,000, 49,000, a significant jump of 10,000 compared to the previous day.

[Report from This Newspaper] Yesterday, over-the-counter trading of US dollars was still rare, with a more solid base than gold. Large transactions were quiet, and mostly small amounts were bought and sold. The morning opening was at 39,000, 41,000, falling to 38,000, 40,000. The noon close was high at 53,000, 55,000. The afternoon opening was at 52,000, 54,000, falling to 49,000, 51,000 at the close. It was 900 higher than the previous day. The overnight interest rate was 3,500, shouted at 52,500, 54,500.

### Chaotic Over-the-Counter Bidding; No Rice Market Trading Yesterday; Flour and Cooking Oil Prices Soar Uncontrollably

Due to price limits in the rice market, prices in producing areas and other industries soared, and merchants could not trade at the price limits, so market trading was effectively suspended. Suburban rice prices rose sharply and chaotically due to high prices in producing areas and rising prices of gold, banknotes, and other goods. White japonica and thin japonica were quoted at 220,000 and 110,000 respectively, and early rice at 210,000 and 200,500, all soaring by more than 20%.

Cooking oil prices soared, due to loose credit, rising prices of all goods, and oil prices were even more affected by the lack of imported goods and low inventories, and merchants were hoarding goods, so the rise was even more severe. Soybean oil closed at 1.36 million, and rapeseed oil at 1.17 million, each rising by 25% to 30%. Jibucket rapeseed oil was 1.35 million, and all goods rose by 25% to 30%. Soybean cake had a customer base and increased sharply by 40%.

Flour followed gold, and the market trend rose sharply by 30%. After the opening, the demand from the booming utility industry surged, and over-the-counter bidding was alarming. The money market was loose, and buying interest was strong, so merchants were very strong in raising prices. The prices of various brands of flour gradually increased after the opening. Laoche (Old Car) brand once reached a high of 87,000, and closed at 85,500 yuan after hearing that the Central Bank was selling. Binship (Warship) closed at 83,500 yuan, and the outer skin knocked on the seventh level, and the over-the-counter price continued to rise.

Miscellaneous grains rose across the board. Soybeans rose sharply by 40% due to the surge in oil cake. Cart soybeans rose to 220,000, and winter soybeans were shouted as high as 230,000 in the over-the-counter market. Raw peanuts rose by more than 100,000, and Yangzhou Tizhuang broke the 500,000 mark. Corn and sorghum generally rose by 30%, and there were few sesame transactions.

### Cotton Yarn Rises Consistently; Cloth Advances Rapidly at High Prices

Yesterday, the yarn market was flying high. The initial opening was still stable, but later, stimulated by the sharp rise in gold prices, people were panicked, and holders raised prices unanimously. The industry tried their best to collect goods, and market prices jumped wildly. As a result, various yarns rose sharply by 20% to 40%.

42-count Lanfeng brand skyrocketed from 11.5 million to 14 million, an increase of 3.5 million, and 40-count Lanfeng broke through the 13 million mark, reaching a new high. 32-count Yinyue (Silver Moon) initially opened at 7.5 million, and finally knocked on the 9 million mark, a rise of 2.1 million.

21-count Shuangma (Double Horse) spot goods initially traded at 5.85 million, reaching a high of 7.6 million, and closed at 7.4 million at noon, a rise of 2.25 million. Prices for 20-count of each grade all rose by 30%, and other yarns all reached unprecedented new highs. In the afternoon, due to the decline in gold prices, people became more cautious, and 21-count Shuangma was sold for 7 million over-the-counter.

The cotton cloth market continued to be firm and elegant. The money market was loose, and purchases from the market and customers increased, and buying interest was renewed. The market trend suddenly became brisk, and prices of various cloths advanced rapidly towards high prices near the close.

In the morning, Longtou (Dragon Head) fine cloth traded at 238,000 yuan, rising to 252,000 yuan, and near noon it fell back to 228,000 yuan. By the close, due to fluctuations in various over-the-counter goods and people's spirits being boosted, the industry absorbed aggressively, and prices reached a new high of 250,000 yuan, an increase of 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day's over-the-counter market.

Sijunzi (Four Gentlemen) serge rose from 227,500 yuan to a high of 238,000 yuan. Later, it fell to 220,500 yuan, and closed at 236,000 yuan at noon, an increase of 5,000 yuan. 190 high-end shilin broke through the 543,000 yuan mark, reaching a new peak. Later, there was another sharp jump in the over-the-counter market. Around 3 o'clock, Longtou fine cloth even knocked on 310,000 yuan, and Sijunzi serge was 295,000 yuan.

### Chinese Stocks Rise

[Report from This Newspaper] The Chinese stock market initially softened and then strengthened in the morning, and continued to rise in the afternoon. Initially, it was rumored that over-the-counter gold was soaring, funds flowed out from the industry, and large investors continued to sell and suppress the market whenever prices were high, and the market situation repeatedly showed weakness. However, due to the large amount of money from banks and the easing of credit, the implicit interest rate dropped sharply, and the surface sentiment was slightly boosted. New buying followed, and the market turned abruptly better near the close. Yongsha opened in the morning at 20.05 yuan, and banks vigorously entered when prices were low, pulling up the market trend, rising to 22.7 yuan. Over-the-counter counterparty gangs continued to sell, and it fluctuated around 21 yuan, hovering weakly. It was unable to stand firm at the peak. Near noon, gold prices rose to the peak, and people feared being suppressed, selling gold and buying stocks, and gold gang funds moved in. The bulls turned around and short squeezed, and the surface buying interest suddenly became strong, and the market trend soared, closing as high as 24.5 yuan.

The trend of small and medium-sized stocks initially softened and then strengthened, and all rose sharply at noon. Xinho initially opened at 4.8 yuan, rising to 5.5 yuan. Xinguang initially opened at 1.6 yuan, rising to 1.75 yuan. Jingfu rose from 0.76 yuan to 0.845 yuan. Qinhe rose from 0.85 yuan to 1.05 yuan. Meiya initially opened at 4.9 yuan and rose to 6 yuan at noon. Jinglun initially opened at 5.5 yuan, falling to 4.7 yuan, the limit down. Near the close, various stocks rose, breaking through the limit again, and finally closed at 5 yuan.

The over-the-counter market sentiment remained good in the afternoon due to the brisk purchases near the close in the morning. Moreover, because trading on Friday afternoon can be extended to Monday of next week, it triggered a buying spree, and Yongsha continued to rise after opening. It was once weak in the middle, but still stood firm near the close, closing at 25.8 yuan. Except for Meiya, which was slightly soft, other stocks all continued to rise. The total turnover for the day was 4.16585 billion shares.

Gold bonds Yesterday, gold prices soared and sentiment was brisk. The market buying interest was relatively strong, and it rose again at noon. The morning opening was bid at 800,000 and offered at 840,000, but no transaction was heard. As gold prices continued to rise, rising to 950,000, it closed at 970,000 at noon, an increase of 110,000 yuan. The afternoon opened at 930,000, but due to the small return in gold prices, sentiment turned stagnant, shouting low at 900,000, and then rising to 950,000 at the close.

The trend of foreign stocks continued to rise as the silver shops eased up. It rose sharply again at noon. Yisha traded at 62,000 yuan, 64,000 yuan, up another 15,000 yuan. Yinglian was 67,000 yuan, 70,000 yuan, also up 15,000 yuan. Yipi was 11,000 yuan, 12,000 yuan, up 12,000 yuan. Huidifeng was bid at 210,000 yuan, and Yazhou was offered at 6,500 yuan.

### Market Stroll

— A Spectator

News Fever; The Market Goes Crazy Again

Starting yesterday, the market went crazy again, retreating slightly near the evening, as if hesitant. But the underlying trend is quite tight; it must be related to the overall situation.

When listening to news about the overall situation, one should be very calm. There will be ups and downs, so people running around in the market should make up their minds.

Now, because of the following two reasons, it is no longer a time to do short-term trading. Once you make up your mind, doing long-term trading can be done with peace of mind and can make money effortlessly.

The first point to pay attention to when doing long-term trading is high interest rates. Yesterday, most prices fluctuated by 20-30%, partly to compensate for the interest arrears from the early-week trend; the other part is anticipating a tightening period before mid-month. Various industries that need to ship goods to free up money to pay wages need to raise prices to unload goods and release interest for a week. This has been the usual practice in recent months, and we have pointed it out several times. Now is that time again.

The second point to pay attention to when doing long-term trading is that preserving assets is more important than preserving currency value. Swap heavy items for light ones, light ones for exquisite ones, and exquisite ones for flexible and lively ones. So, in the midst of all the craziness, you still have to see clearly and recognize accurately. Those who blindly follow will end up wearing wet clothes.

If you are looking at short-term trading, then the mid-month funds transfer to pay salaries is more important than the overall situation.

In the past few market dynamics before salary payments, the closer it got to the salary payment period, the tighter the credit and the higher the interest rate; while prices fell behind. Therefore, most employers sold goods consecutively at high prices to release interest one week before the salary payment; and transferred the interest on the loan. In this way, in principle, there should be more funds and the cost of borrowing lower, but why is the opposite true? Because most people are releasing goods for the transfer, so the prices are soft, and because prices are soft, people who want to release goods but are hesitant feel the urgency of needing funds. This market contradiction forms the special trend in the week before salary payment.

Releasing goods and transferring funds one week before salary payment is indeed the employer's preparation; it also has a great impact on the general working class. Because prices are stable before salary payment, the declared cost of living index is lowered, and the impressions of all parties are better. In other words, the employer's burden is lighter. Only in this way, employers not only need to transfer funds and sell, but also have this class consciousness playing a role in the background. Thirdly, selling goods one week before salary payment means that one week of interest can be collected. Although the hope of rolling interest on interest is very strong, the hope of 7% or 8% is not without certainty. So why not do it?

Because of these relationships, when looking at short-term trading, you have to see this in the bones. So, yesterday's craziness and the underlying firmness still exist in the short-term twists and turns.

For example, taking the stock market as an example, although the bull companies have not yet ended, the model is very stable. But when you calculate the interest, the meat is not very thick. Salary transfers and the stock market are the most convenient, and the bull market is not very thick. Salary transfers and the stock market are the most convenient. Bull companies looking at the short term and the long term will never look at their own books.

By the way, let me mention gold, banknotes, and silver dollars. Looking at the big picture, there may be new changes in the Central Bank's measures in the gold market. The sharp jump in silver dollars these two days has a lot to do with the business of scraping blood. The lag in US dollars is because the actual sales are not as good as silver dollars, and the flexibility is not as good as silver dollars. This account will not be calculated for the time being. But it is cheaper for the Central Bank. Please pay attention to the changes in the foreign exchange transfer certificate.

Long-Term is Better Than Short-Term; Salary Payment Cycle

### Haiqing Performs Excellently; Shanghai Police Wins by Two Goals

[Report from This Newspaper] The Jia 1st group of the basketball league is coming to an end. Before the Shanghai Police vs. Haiqing match last night, it was generally expected that the Shanghai Police would be able to handle it easily. However, the result was that Haiqing performed exceptionally well and made very quick shots. The Shanghai Police were still behind by five points in the last five minutes. Haiqing did not use a freeze tactic, so they were fortunate to win 51-47. The score in the first half was 24-21. Haiqing played with the 3rd team of McKinnis last night. Wang Bowen did not participate due to exams. Jia 2D Shandan team won Chengyou 38-28.

He Jingui also returned the favor, tying the score at 3-3. Lai Ruohua scored again, and Rongsheng and Jiuquan scored, exceeding 6-5. Laimushan's goal reversed the situation again. From then on, the Shanghai Police attacked continuously, and the foreign generals frequently failed. Moreover, they missed seven consecutive free throws. However, the right wing Hua Ji ran fast and shot accurately, echoing Laimushan on the left and right, which made the Shanghai Police very worried. The Shanghai Police had a slight advantage in the first half 24-21.

In the second half, the Shanghai Police changed Moses for Jiuquan, and Jingui for He Zeng. Under the fierce attack, Haiqing shot extremely quickly, and in a while, they chased the score to 24, 26, and 28, tying the score three times. Jiuquan was changed for Moses again, and Ounas and Hua Ji each scored one goal. The Shanghai Police was shocked by 32-28 and called a timeout. After that, Haiqing still had the upper hand, but the difference was often only one point, and the situation was extremely tense. Hua Ji scored three consecutive goals, reaching 44-39. At that time, there were still five minutes left. Haiqing felt that the victory or defeat was not important to the overall situation, and still wasted frequently, giving the Shanghai Police a chance to take advantage of. Then, He Zeng, Jiuquan, and Yong Biao made free throws and scored, chasing to 45-44, one point short. Jingui replaced Jiuquan again, and Yong Biao scored a basket, exceeding by one point. Hua Ji made two free throws and took the lead again. He Zeng got a free throw opportunity, held his breath and calmly made it, tying the score at 47 each. He Liang took the opportunity to score two more goals, and the Shanghai Police was lucky to win the final victory 51-47.

Fifteen minutes into the game, Zhang Jiliang passed from the right, and Jiang Kun scored with a header, giving Longtou the first goal. However, five minutes later, Zhongyi's Chen Longquan passed to an open spot, and Yu Zhenyue caught up and scored, tying the game. About ten minutes later, Lu Fangkui scored, also thanks to Chen Longquan's assist, putting Zhongyi ahead 2-1. Afterwards, the game became a stalemate, and the first half ended soon after.

After switching sides, Longtou replaced goalkeeper Gao Weichen with Yan Chengkuan, and Jiang Kun was replaced by Wang Burong. Both teams were eager to win, inevitably leading to some rough play. Fortunately, the referee's strict penalties kept the peace. In the final thirteen minutes of the intense battle, Wang Burong took a corner kick, and his placement was excellent. Zhang Jiliang waited in front of the goal and scored with one touch, tying the game at 2-2. Although there were many highlights afterwards, both defenses were tight, and the score remained unchanged.

### Mini World Games

[Associated Press, Lausanne, Switzerland, 7th] The International Olympic Committee will meet in Rome this month to discuss the issue of mini-World Games. They will be held separately in Asia and Central America in 1950, and the Pan American Games will be held in 1951.

### Women's Basketball Tactics

— Translated by Qi Gong

(A) When the forward moves towards the basket to receive the ball.

(B) The defender passes the ball along the sideline to the forward in the designated area before leaving the area and reaching the mid-line. To avoid passing the ball in the middle of the court, it is more secure to use the defender standing on the sideline to pass the ball.

(C) Increase speed and body rotation, suddenly change pace and turn around. Move forward quickly using body weight, shortening steps, and stopping by slightly bending the knees.

(D) While running, be able to quickly change pace and direction, stop, start, turn around, fake moves, or fake turn around and dart in another direction. These actions must be practiced until proficient. (Note: The above is the art of running and must be practiced diligently to achieve physical agility and versatility.)

C. Rebounding

(1) Rebounding.

(A) When an offensive player shoots, after the ball leaves their hand and heads towards the basket, the defender should immediately prepare to rebound.

(B) When the opponent is taking a free throw, the player positioned on the sideline of the free throw area should immediately step into the key area under the basket after the free thrower releases the ball to rebound. The offensive forward must proceed cautiously, as it is easy to commit a foul by stepping into the key area for more than three seconds. The responsibility for rebounding can be assigned to the free thrower, who can still stand near the free throw line to rebound or receive a pass from a teammate under the basket to shoot again.

(C) If a player is not proficient in rebounding, they must pay attention to the following three methods:

(1) Use fingertips to push the ball to a teammate standing farther from the basket.

(2) Jump high and use both hands to push the ball to the sideline to maintain control.

(3) A forward can jump high and use fingertips to push the ball into the basket.

(D) Players must practice jumping and timing to rebound. This is a required course, but many women's teams do not pay attention to it.

Note: Gaining possession and controlling the ball under the basket can enhance the offense and solidify the defense. Being tall and having long legs naturally provides an advantage. However, if one is not skilled in positioning, height is useless and can even be a disadvantage. When rebounding, do not go too deep under the basket, otherwise the rebounded ball will fly over the head and be missed. If one is too far from the basket, the attacker can take the lead and shoot again. The most important thing is to clearly see the direction the ball is rebounding. The position should be about seven or eight feet from the basket. (To be continued. C)

### Starting from the Teahouse

— Qian Dacheng

Last winter, when a pot of clear tea rose to five yuan in gold yuan notes, I gave up my ten-year habit of going to the teahouse every afternoon because of financial constraints.

In our Changshu, going to the teahouse is simply an indispensable part of life for the upper, middle, and lower classes. Those at the top discuss public affairs, those in the middle chat casually or play chess all day, and those at the bottom negotiate deals. Also, resolving conflicts after an argument (called "drinking tea to talk things out") all happen in teahouses.

The number of teahouses in Changshu is second only to Suzhou. About one or two tenths of them also operate as story-telling venues. However, their nature and structure are all different. Places like "Li Li" and "Huan Cui Small Abode" (the name Huan Cui was given by Yan Gu, the author of *Continued Sea Flowers*, borrowing the name of Old Can's concubine) inside the park face the city and overlook the water, making them very elegant. In the summer, the shade is picturesque, and a cup of clear tea is a pleasure in life. The four teahouses of "Shi Mei" (Zhen Shi Xuan, Wang Shan Xuan, Yi Xin Lu, Xin Mei Ling) all have hundreds of years of history. The poet Yang Wu-yang wrote well in his "Shi Mei Bamboo Branch Verse": "Zhen Shi Wang Shan compete for seats, sandalwood olives and pre-rain tea". The grandeur of those years can still be glimpsed from this. This is the main base for the idle class who live off rent. They have tea morning and evening every day, rain or shine, without fail, more seriously than going to the office. However, last year, no rice rent was collected, and clear tea increased in price every three days, and then every two days. Now it costs 300 gold yuan notes per pot, so the number of tea drinkers is decreasing day by day. The waiters sit idle and sigh, constantly reminiscing about the golden age of the past. The famous "Shi Mei Sesame Cake" is also getting thinner and smaller day by day, and the taste has become bland. From this, it can be reflected that the idle class (or the petty bourgeoisie) is declining day by day.

"De Yi Lou" and "Chang Le" outside the South Gate, however, are still packed with tea drinkers, thanks to the merchants and "quasi-merchants". In order to find out market prices, or buy and sell, "throw their hats" or "carry briefcases", they have to go to the teahouse. They don't care about 300 yuan per pot of clear tea, and they eat a table full of snacks. "Merchants always have a way," people are heard saying everywhere. Reality cannot be resisted. In chaotic times, there is no talk of elegance. The people who "drink tea" are after all more than the people who "savor tea," and later on, there will probably only be people who "guzzle" tea.

The ending of elegance is just poverty, and only those who "guzzle" can understand the true meaning of life. My little essay is a bit nostalgic for the past, and inevitably a bit poor. But this is also inevitable.

### A Cremation Record

— Yishi

Recently, I attended a friend's cremation ceremony. The ceremony was simple and solemn, and it is worth promoting.

In Shanghai, cremation seems to be more common than in the interior—but it can't be said to be common, just more so. My friend strongly advocated cremation during his lifetime, so after his death and the completion of the funeral rites, he was sent to Jing'an Cemetery. Jing'an Cemetery is the only place in the city with cremation facilities. At the start of the ceremony, the body was placed on an iron frame about the size of a small bed and pushed into the furnace. The furnace is made of fire-resistant bricks, about three or four feet wide and five or six feet high, with a roof and a chimney. The iron frame is pushed in, just like a bread clip for baking bread. After the iron frame is pushed in, the furnace door is closed, and then the gas filling the furnace is ignited, immediately burning fiercely. First the clothes, then the skin, can be seen through a small hole in the furnace door. Afterwards, the manager does not allow family members and friends to stay, so as to avoid seeing it and being unbearable.

At this point, the funeral is over, and family and friends leave. After about two hours, the body has been completely reduced to ashes, which are collected by the funeral home and placed in a marble, metal, or wooden ash box. The box is small, beautiful, and is handed over to the family to collect.

According to the manager, this facility was only available to foreigners and Chinese Christians who had lived in Shanghai for more than three years before the war. When the Japanese occupied Shanghai, it was used by the Japanese. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it was taken over by our health authorities, and with vigorous promotion, it is now in a state of being unable to meet the demand.

After attending this cremation ceremony, I deeply believe that this may be the best way to solve funeral problems. It is simple and does not lose its solemnity, achieving the goals of saving effort, money, and time. (All procedures are handled by the funeral home, and the cost is much less than burial.) The ash box can also be purchased in a burial plot or carried around, and it can be worshipped and commemorated. I think it is indeed worth promoting.

### Buying Hope

— Xianjun

Feng Xuan went to Xue on behalf of Lord Mengchang to collect rent, but instead bought back "righteousness" with the money. Now there are those who buy "hope," which can be compared to ancient and modern times. What is called buying hope? Well, it is the relief lottery issued by the current authorities, which is being snapped up. By spending five hundred gold yuan notes, you can have the hope of winning thirty million gold yuan alone, and you can also gain a reputation for doing good deeds. Therefore, it is no wonder that everyone rushes to it in droves.

I have a friend who told me a funny story. He said that a friend of his was so destitute that he only had a few pawn tickets and a relief lottery ticket that someone had given him in his pocket. He wanted to commit suicide several times, but in the end, because of the hope of winning thirty million yuan alone, he did not have the courage to commit suicide.

I said that judging from the various measures taken by the authorities in recent years, issuing relief lotteries can also be regarded as one of the good policies—because it saved someone's life and prevented him from committing suicide immediately.

### Crumbs of Wisdom

— Zhu Wei

During the recent war, scientists invented a piece of paper that could predict poison gas. It could be inserted into the tip of a gun, and when there was poison gas in the air, the paper would change color due to chemical action.

The number of electrons passing through a sixteen-candlepower carbon filament light bulb in one second would take three million people 16,700 years to count.

The famous psychologist Kuroda Ryo has studied the frequency of dreams in men and women. According to him, men dream an average of 2.7 times in ten days, and women 3.5 times.

### American Comic Books

— Suo Yu

In the big cities of our country, comic books have become a common "children's reading material"; but in general poor rural areas, they are still not easy to see. But in the United States, the situation is different. American comic books are truly a miracle in the publishing industry, with an average monthly circulation of 60 million copies.

The content of American comic books is of course different from that of our country. They replace sword light magic treasures with rockets and death ray guns, and barbarians and beasts with demons and monsters. The content is mostly filled with murder and crazy lies, which are of course harmful and useless to children.

The American education community is unanimously opposed to these comic books. They have collected many criminal cases caused by comic books. A seventeen-year-old deliberately stabbed a thirteen-year-old companion, saying, "I don't read a lot of comic books—I only read about ten a week. I like to read comic books about crime, where they often stab girls to death with knives." Another seventeen-year-old youth killed someone and left a note with the words "Devil" signed on it. Three sixteen-year-olds jointly killed a fourteen-year-old boy "for revenge". A fourteen-year-old boy shot and killed a policeman. A thirteen-year-old boy took a handgun to a store to rob money. Another twelve-year-old child killed his sister; and a thirteen-year-old boy murdered his companion and was sentenced to twenty-two years in prison. According to their own accounts, the protagonists of these shocking crimes all liked to read comic books.

In schools, comic books have caused shocking violence. A sixteen-year-old child was beaten all over his body with a broken glass bottle by his classmates. There were six places near his eyes that needed to be stitched up. In a primary school, older students often abused and intimidated younger ones, robbing them of their money, watches, and fountain pens. When teachers asked them who had stolen their things, they refused to say, for fear of "having their eyes gouged out." In a civilian school, two police officers regularly patrol to prevent various acts of violence. The mathematics teacher at a certain school must ask a police officer to help him "proctor" during exams.

In the United States, only 25 percent of parents do not object to comic books; the remaining 75 percent strongly advocate banning them. They all believe that comic books not only deprive children of the opportunity to read good books, but also chronically poison children's minds. Children themselves have noticed this. At a primary school in Chicago, students took the initiative to burn all their comic books and went to nearby bookstores and stationery stores to tell the owners that they would never buy comic books again. Recently, several other schools have also launched this "refusal to read" movement.

### Weekend Entertainment

— Yu Wangwo

### In the Restaurant

— Ruoxu

This is a true story that I witnessed.

I work in a small company. Because the office is too far from home, I always eat lunch at a nearby restaurant. That restaurant, neither big nor small, has all kinds of food, both good and bad; therefore, people from all walks of life patronize it; although it cannot be said to be bustling, it is still quite prosperous. Among these people from all walks of life, there is one who has attracted my great attention. This gentleman, wearing a long gown and a felt hat, carrying a briefcase, and wearing a circular badge on his chest, walks steadily and carries a bit of literary air, undoubtedly a low-level civil servant in some agency.

About less than half a year ago, I first saw him step into this restaurant and happened to sit opposite me. He ordered a set meal, added some side dishes, and poured some wine. He sipped and ate, leisurely looking out the door, truly enjoying himself. Of course, I am a poor guy and can only eat things like salted broad beans and soy sauce radish. Seeing such a lavish customer, I couldn't help but feel respectful, and on the other hand, I was a little envious. But unfortunately, I lacked the money, so I could only swallow my saliva, greedily look at his lavish dishes, chew the soy sauce radish hard, and swallow the rice in big mouthfuls, even hurting my tongue. So I blamed everything on that lavish customer. I finished my meal quickly, gave him an angry glance, and then paid the bill and went out with resentment.

Strangely, he seemed to be intentionally trying to annoy me. He often arrived at the same time as me, neither early nor late, and sat nearby. So the above routine became my homework: every day I glared at him, paid the bill, and went out with an injured tongue.

But a month ago, the lavish customer in my mind gradually changed. He no longer seemed lavish. His dishes changed from lavish to inferior, and then from inferior to barely adding any dishes. Then his set meal also went down from high-end to mid-range, and then to economy. He no longer looked leisurely out the door. Every day, he hurried in, hunched over the table, finished his few mouthfuls of red rice, and hurried out again. Occasionally, he looked up at me, his eyes seeming to carry some embarrassment, and quickly bowed his head to eat. Although, at this time, what he ate was still better than what I ate, I still couldn't even qualify for the set meal club.

But a week ago, he finally fell from this club as well. He started not eating set meals, but instead eating six steamed buns, and then gradually changed from six to four. He no longer looked at me at all, and just hurried in and hurried out every day...

One day, perhaps the kind-hearted waiter had noticed his declining state, or perhaps he even pitied him, and said to him kindly:

"Old customer, I think you should switch to plain rice. Four steamed buns cost more than a thousand, and it's not as filling as plain rice. Rice only costs eight hundred, and it comes with a side dish."

I put down my chopsticks and looked up at that lavish customer—he wasn't lavish anymore. His lips trembled, wanting to say something, his face turned red, a look of embarrassment. But then he didn't say anything, a bitter smile flashed across his face. He lowered his head and said softly, "Thank you, just get me a plain rice meal." So his rice was served; two bowls of red rice, a plate of soy sauce radish, exactly the same as mine, the worst kind. I looked at the three slices of soy sauce radish placed in front of each of us and smiled subconsciously.

After that day, I went to eat lunch as usual. But this time, I felt a noticeable difference. The lavish customer across from me was gone. He didn't come anymore. Did the waiter hurt his self-esteem? Or did he not even have the money for plain rice anymore?

In the corner, an old gramophone was playing an old and faded song record: "When Will You Return?" I couldn't help but feel sorry for that declining low-level civil servant, even though he had repeatedly made my tongue hurt from chewing. So I chewed the soy sauce radish more furiously.

### "Adding Fuel to the Fire"

— Suobei

After carefully analyzing the character "談" (talk), I deeply feel that it is not good. Because our Mr. Cangjie, when he created this character, put "fire on top of fire" to the right of the character "言" (speech).

Is it that Mr. Cangjie, like Liu Bowen, had considerable foresight?
