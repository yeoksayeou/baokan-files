### Truman, Acheson, and Two Senators Discuss Current Situation in China; Bridges and Wiley Both Advocate Increasing Aid to China; Nolan Urges Rapid Establishment of a Constructive Policy Toward the Far East

[US News Agency, Washington, 28th] Senator Bridges of New Hampshire and Senator Wiley of Nebraska discussed the situation in China with President Truman and Secretary of State Acheson for 45 minutes today. Both Bridges and Wiley are key Republican figures in the Senate who have criticized the United States' policy toward China.

Bridges is a key Republican member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Wiley is the Senate Republican leader. Both have strongly criticized the government's China policy and have advocated for the United States to increase aid to the National Government to fight against the Chinese Communist Party.

Afterwards, when reporters asked the two senators questions, both said that they did not feel they had the right to reveal what conclusions were reached, but Wiley said that the reports he received were very helpful to him, allowing him "to try to understand things that I did not understand before."

Later, when reporters asked the Secretary of State questions, Acheson said that there was nothing else to report except what the two senators had already said.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Senator Nolan accused the State Department today of building an iron curtain around US policy toward China and renewed his call for an expedited investigation into US foreign policy in the Far East.

Nolan read to the Senate a letter he sent to Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Connally, requesting that hearings be held as soon as possible on his proposed resolution calling for the establishment of a special joint committee of both houses of Congress to study the situation in China. The letter stated, "In view of the rapid deterioration of the overall situation in China, I believe that this country can no longer delay the establishment of a constructive policy toward the Far East. If we wait for the situation to clear up, the result will likely be the communist conquest of all of Asia. No member of Congress has ever seen Wallace's report on China after his trip to China as Vice President in 1944. The rumor that 90% or more of the military aid given by the United States to China has fallen into the hands of the Communist Party is an example of incorrect thinking, in which those who are ill-informed have secretly undermined the attempt to aid the Chinese government.

### Phil and Gorlick Both Advocate Adopting a New Open Door Policy

[United Press, New Haven, 29th] Former Assistant Secretary of the Army Phil gave a speech at a Yale University debate on the 28th, advocating the adoption of a new Open Door Policy in China and the establishment of a Far East Trade Agreement supported by the United States. These two measures are necessary to curb the disturbances caused by the advance of the Chinese Communist Party. Regarding the Open Door, the United States should reach an agreement with the Chinese authorities to establish open areas in Taiwan, Hainan Island, and mainland China, whose social and economic significance should be greater than their military significance. Japan, the Philippines, and Indonesia will face economic difficulties after cutting off trade with Communist China. The United States should consult with Guangzhou and immediately seek to reach agreements with these regions in order to stabilize the situation.

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Former State Department official and government consultant Gorlick submitted a report to the National Policy Planning Association's State Council Committee on the 28th, advocating that the United States reaffirm and draft a new Open Door Policy to trade with the Chinese Communists, saying that if the United States adopts an attitude of friendship, assistance, and non-interference, it may be able to prevent China from being controlled by the Soviet Union. The United States should continue to provide reasonable assistance to the areas controlled by the Chinese Kuomintang government, but should no longer provide military assistance. Gorlick advocated restoring the Open Door Policy advocated by John Hay, implementing the following four points: (1) Insisting on China's territorial integrity and right to self-determination; (2) Restoring international trade when the situation improves; (3) Providing China with technical and economic assistance to improve its standard of living; (4) Striving to promote private medical schools and missionary programs. Gorlick also stated that the United States and China share common interests, both wanting to suppress Soviet imperialism, permanently limit Japanese power to its home islands, and maintain the philosophy of international life.

[Associated Press, London, 28th] Authoritative sources stated on the 28th that the United Kingdom will soon have two diplomatic representatives in China, one stationed in the communist area and one stationed in the Nationalist area.

### Editorial: Quickly Guide the Economy Back on Track

Economic changes, no matter what, cannot escape the reality of politics. The reaction of the market in this city after the withdrawal from Nanjing is particularly concrete and significant. Factories have no intention of engaging in reproduction, shops are unwilling to do more business, the financial community has stopped providing credit to businesses, and speculators have mostly disappeared. All of this shows that Shanghai's economy has fallen into a state of paralysis. As a result, various transactions cannot be carried out, the money market is tight and unpredictable, and the discount rates vary widely. In fact, most of the large differences are generated by the need to "adapt to changes." For example, the skyrocketing prices of rice and grain in the past few days, as well as the dramatic drop in the prices of gold, banknotes, silver dollars, and general daily necessities, can illustrate the economic trends in the chaos.

From another perspective, in such an extraordinary situation, due to the reasons of "adapting to changes" and "escaping from disaster," the people's desire for cash has become stronger, and the shortage of banknotes has become even more widespread. Therefore, a few days ago, not only did the discount rate create a new record of 40%, but the cash price and the check price of general commodities also differed by more than half. Although the Central Bank has now issued large banknotes of 100,000 yuan to supply the market, it is still not enough to meet the actual needs of the market. Therefore, there is still a clear gap between the price of cash and the price of checks in the market. The pressure of life on the people today is already not light. If we add this unexpected burden, it is tantamount to adding frost to snow, and it is simply forcing people to the point where they cannot survive!

Due to the deficiencies of wartime psychology, all parties are worried about the possible closure of banks and money shops at any time. As a result, checks are not generally used in the market, bank drafts are not accepted, and even bank drafts from the Central Bank are rejected. This is actually a major reason for increasing the current difficulties. In fact, bank drafts and checks are both tools in the credit market that replace the circulation of currency. They have the same function as currency and should not have any price difference from cash, let alone be rejected. The abnormal phenomenon that is occurring now can be said to be a misconception under everyone's excessive tension! However, if bank drafts and checks are not used, and cash is in short supply, all normal transactions will inevitably be in a state of stagnation, and legitimate industry and commerce will inevitably be unable to maintain themselves.

Moreover, recently, prices have been quoted in silver dollars, and many foods and fuels are limited to transactions in silver dollars. Gold yuan notes cannot be used to buy them at all. However, the rewards and income that ordinary people and salaried classes have earned through hard work are only gold yuan notes and bank drafts. Now that the use of gold yuan notes and bank drafts has been restricted, ordinary people and salaried classes, in order to avoid the attack of hunger, can only adapt to the unreasonable environment and endure exploitation, so their lives have been greatly discounted. Due to the difficulties and bitterness in general life, people's anxieties, as well as social order and chaos, have been caused. We do not know how such a major event has occurred, and how the authorities can remain silent? The government is originally an institution that serves the people. Is there any time more important than now to serve the people?

Now that the situation has evolved to such a point, and the flames of war are burning at our eyebrows, the authorities should take the "quick knife to cut the tangled hemp" approach to deal with the complex situation. We must know that today, no matter how the overall situation evolves, stabilizing people's livelihoods is the top priority. What we call stabilizing people's livelihoods is to guide the chaotic economic order back on track and restore it to its previous state. Therefore, economic measures must be beneficial to the people and avoid stimulating people's hearts. If we still sing high-profile tunes and issue blank checks, no matter what throwing or drawing policies or other clever tricks we have, it will be difficult to achieve the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods.

In the current situation, the war has not yet reached Shanghai, but the economic order of this city has already fallen into chaos. Regardless of the degree of distress and inconvenience to the people, the future of the entire Shanghai may not be optimistic. Furthermore, political, military, and economic affairs have a mutual cause-and-effect relationship, and the economic impact on military and political affairs is particularly significant. Therefore, we remind the officials in charge of finance and banking to quickly discuss countermeasures to break the current chaotic, tense, and uneasy economic situation. Wouldn't that be a blessing not only for the six million people of Shanghai?

As for the city's industry and commerce, in this critical and difficult situation, we must work together with one heart and one mind to maintain our own prosperity. If everyone cares only about their own affairs and ignores the disturbing order of society, then the entire market will fall into stagnation, which will certainly be self-defeating. Moreover, this city has always been the economic center. How many industrial workers are there in the city, and how many employees are there in the shops? Once industry and commerce are depressed, the serious threat of unemployment will certainly be extremely terrible. At that time, not only will the entire public security problem be impossible to maintain, but the foundation of industry and commerce will also be shaken. Therefore, in this depressing problem of "the wind is filling the tower before the mountain rain comes," such as unifying the prices of cash and checks, stabilizing the prices of fuel and main food products, accepting the buying and selling of bank drafts and cash, and restoring the financing of manufacturers by money shops, etc. In short, human beings help themselves through mutual assistance, and prosper together through coexistence. If everyone eliminates the psychology of panic and cooperates sincerely, then the people's economic life can be brought back on track; with economic stability, social chaos can naturally be eliminated.

### Seeking a Comprehensive Solution to the German Problem, the United States Insists on Three Basic Principles, Guaranteeing the Protection of the Interests of the West German People and Taking into Account European Peace and Security

[Reuters Washington, 28th] U.S. Secretary of State Acheson delivered a speech to the association of British newspaper publishers here today, outlining three principles that the U.S. government believes are necessary to resolve the German problem. Acheson pointed out that in order for the German problem to be satisfactorily resolved, it must (1) continue the plan to establish a West German government and include this plan in the general solution to the German problem; (2) be able to protect the security interests of the entire Europe; and (3) resolve the future of Germany in a peaceful and orderly manner. Acheson emphasized the need to reassure the West German people that the U.S. government would not agree to a general solution to the German problem that did not include the basic deployment of establishing a West German government. The Germans can trust the United States that unless there is a general solution of this nature, the U.S. government will continue to strongly support the development of the West German government plan. The German people can be assured that the U.S. government will not agree to any measures concerning Germany that disregard the collective interests of Europe. At the same time, the American people can also be assured that in any discussions concerning the future of Germany, the U.S. government will never forget the premise of resolving this major issue in a peaceful and orderly manner. Acheson then mentioned the discussions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the Berlin blockade, expressing that if there is a possibility of resuming discussions among the four powers, the U.S. government must do its best to resolve this most serious problem in the world today. However, when the U.S. government, together with other Western allies, begins to discuss new measures regarding West Germany, it does not mean that the U.S. has given up hope of obtaining a solution applicable to the entire German problem, or that the U.S. has closed the door to resuming discussions among the four powers, but it means that the U.S. is unwilling to wait indefinitely for the four powers to reach an agreement on the German problem before seeking to restore West Germany to a sound and promising condition. Acheson did not strongly criticize the Soviet Union, but only pointed out, when mentioning West Germany's economic difficulties, that this was the result of the Soviet Union's attempt to control Germany's economic and political life. At the end of 1947, the Soviet Union seemed to be trying to undermine any solution that would not allow the Soviet Union to control Germany's economic and political life. The failure of the two foreign ministers' meetings in Moscow and London proves this, and the paralysis of the Allied Control Authority in Berlin has created an intolerable situation. Germany's economy has been increasingly in dire straits due to the division. Fortunately, with the help of the United States, it has been spared from a major disaster.

### Malik Receives New Instructions from Moscow, U.S. and Soviet Representatives Continue Talks, Foreign Ministers' Conference May Be Held in Paris in May

[Our Report] New York, 29th Broadcast: Flushing News The U.S. delegation to the United Nations announced today that the representatives of the U.S. and the Soviet Union will resume talks in New York on resolving the Berlin blockade. Earlier this morning, Soviet Representative Malik telephoned U.S. Representative Jessup to arrange a meeting at Malik's office at 4 p.m. (8 p.m. Coordinated Universal Time). It is reported that Malik has received new instructions from Moscow regarding the lifting of the blockade and the convening of a four-power foreign ministers' conference.

[Our Report] London, 29th Broadcast: British officials have made cautious predictions, saying that if things go smoothly, the Berlin blockade may be lifted within two weeks. Although London officials recognize that the Soviet Union can still change its attitude at the last minute, they are optimistic about the future of the negotiations.

[Reuters Success Lake, 28th] Spokespersons for Western powers emphasized that before the Foreign Ministers' Conference can be convened, the details of lifting the Berlin blockade should be drafted first. The three powers also hope that the Soviet Union can guarantee that it will not quibble over the agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is also learned that the memorandum submitted by the three powers to Soviet Representative Malik yesterday also attempts to obtain the Soviet Union's explanation on the following points: (1) The convening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference will not delay the establishment of the West German Republic; (2) Before the convening of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, all trade and transportation restrictions should be lifted; (3) If an agreement is reached on the aforementioned point C, a four-power conference can be convened to prepare the agenda for the Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is generally believed that after Moscow officially confirms the first three understandings, talks can be held in New York to discuss the details of lifting the blockade. Those involved expect that the Foreign Ministers' Conference can be convened in Paris after May.

### Soviet Assistant to the UN Secretariat Replaced

[Agence France-Presse Success Lake, 28th] United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie announced today that Soviet Assistant Secretary-General Sobolev, who is in charge of the Security Council's transactions, has submitted his resignation to Lie today. His successor will be Sin-xing-ke, Secretary-General of the Soviet Delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. Sobolev left Success Lake and returned to the Soviet Union in January of this year due to his son's serious illness. In his letter of resignation, Sobolev explained that the reason for his resignation was a family health problem, and that he may resume his work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow. Before serving as Secretary-General of the Soviet Delegation, Xin-xing-ke served as Director of the Intelligence Bureau of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After soliciting the opinions of the Soviet government, the United Nations authorities have decided to appoint Xin-xing-ke to succeed him. Well-informed sources said that Sobolev is an expert on Soviet preparedness issues, and participated in the Potsdam Conference as an advisor to Marshal Zhukov. Therefore, he may assume an important position in future discussions on preparedness issues.

### The Future of U.S. Foreign Policy: Strive for Peaceful Cooperation, Eliminate the Scourge of War and Enable Mankind to Enjoy a Healthy Life

[U.S. Information Service Washington, 28th] Jessup, Ambassador-at-Large of the United States, affirmed that the foreign policy he pursues places the primary emphasis on resolving all international disputes through peaceful means. Jessup stated firmly in a speech delivered to the American Society of International Law here tonight, "Whenever there are international frictions or disputes, governments, in joint or individual actions, may adopt any of four policies. (1) They may ignore the problem, which is a policy of isolationism or a distorted neutrality. (2) They may stimulate or encourage conflict, which is a policy of international disruption or sabotage. (3) They may seek to suppress conflict by force, which is a policy of domination. In the current stage of world transactions, this policy often cannot take the form of international police action. (4) They may seek to mediate conflict through international cooperation, which is the policy of the United Nations and also the policy of the United States." This American politician commented that efforts to seek international cooperation in the political realm are often not moving enough. However, he said, "We understand that unless we find another way out besides war, we cannot prevent war. We know that the way out besides war includes fundamentally improving the international situation, draining the stagnant pools where the bacteria of war grow, or turning them into reservoirs of life. We know that in the first living human society, there will be disagreements, and these disagreements must be adjusted."

### UN General Assembly Re-Debates International Cooperation Case

[Reuters New York, Flushing Meadow, 29th] The United Nations General Assembly debated yesterday on suggestions to promote international cooperation in the political field. The General Assembly discussed several resolutions passed by the former small-scale General Assembly, one of which was to restore the 1928 League of Nations' law on the peaceful resolution of disputes, and another was to recommend to the Security Council that when disputes arise over the election of directors as mediators, the Security Council should seek mediation to reach an agreement. These resolutions were strongly opposed by the Soviet Union and Slavic countries, as the Soviet Union and other countries firmly believe that the small-scale General Assembly is an illegal organization.

### The Cold War in Berlin Continues

### Austin and Johnson Strongly Urge Approval of the Atlantic Treaty and Testify Before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee

[U.S. Information Service Washington, 28th] Today, as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee continued to hear opinions regarding the alliance of self-defense signed by twelve countries here on April 4, Austin spoke in favor of the Atlantic Treaty. Before this treaty has binding force on the United States, it must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the Senate. Secretary of Defense Johnson spoke after Austin and also urged the prompt approval of the treaty. These hearings began on Wednesday, with Secretary of State Acheson first testifying, and it is expected that these hearings will continue for a month or six weeks.

[Reuters Washington, 28th] U.S. Representative to the United Nations Austin stated today when testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the Atlantic Treaty that as the non-communist world's opposition to communist forces increases daily, the forces supporting peaceful development have gradually gained the upper hand. The Atlantic Treaty is nothing less than a barrier, enabling the Atlantic region to more quickly achieve the goals and policies of the United Nations. The majority of the world is attempting to establish a collective security system within the United Nations, but the Soviet Union is attempting to seek its own security through a policy of territorial expansion. These feudal security ideas will cast a dark shadow over Eastern Europe. Fortunately, the United Nations, with the support of the United States, is carrying out decisive efforts to prevent Iran, Greece, and Korea from falling into the dark shadow. Austin also emphasized that the Atlantic Treaty will never replace the United Nations or weaken its position, nor does it represent the restoration of the balance of power system. The treaty can give the principle of peace a position above all else.

[United Press Washington, 28th] Secretary of Defense Johnson stated his opinion today before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, requesting the passage of a $1.13 billion military aid plan for the Atlantic Treaty countries. It is said that the treaty alone cannot achieve the goal of safeguarding peace unless the treaty is fully implemented and the peace forces in the treaty will be damaged. Once war occurs, we will pay an unlimited price, because we do not issue the treaty.

### Letter to Party Members from the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee

[Canton, 28th Dispatch from the Central News Agency] In order to strictly adhere to President Chiang's statement on the 27th, the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang issued a letter to all party members, calling on all party members to unite sincerely, strive hard, and vow to contend with the Chinese Communist Party to save the country and protect the party, to comfort the spirits of the Premier and the martyrs in heaven. The original text is as follows:

"A Letter to All Party Members from the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang on Saving the Country and Protecting the Party through War against the Communists: Since April 1st, when the representatives of our government and the representatives of the Chinese Communist Party held peace talks in Peiping, compatriots across the country have hoped that peace would begin from then on. The sincerity of our party for peace talks and the four principles of peace talks solemnly decided upon were officially announced on the 18th of this month. Entrusted by the people and our party, the government authorities have not hesitated to endure all kinds of humiliation and burdens, and have been subjected to all kinds of unreasonable ridicule and slander from the Chinese Communist Party, hoping that sincerity would prevail and move even metal and stone. We only seek to enable the people to achieve peace and the country to be guaranteed. Then any sacrifice of party members will not be considered. Unexpectedly, the Chinese Communist Party revealed its ferocity and presented to our government representatives the full text of its so-called "Domestic Peace Agreement," consisting of eight articles and twenty-four clauses. As can be seen in national newspapers, it is even more arrogant and tyrannical than the Twenty-One Demands that Japan presented to us thirty years ago. If our government accepts it, not only will the Chinese Kuomintang and the Republic of China, which were created with difficulty by the Premier and the martyrs, be eliminated from then on, but also the basic freedoms and rights granted to the people of the country by the constitution will be deprived from then on, and they will forever endure the life of slavery in the Iron Curtain. Moreover, in Mao Zedong's broadcast, if a world war unfortunately occurs, our Chinese nation needs to prepare to be led by the Chinese Communist Party to fight for the Soviet Union, uniting the Chinese people to serve as cannon fodder for others. How can we face our ancestors above and our descendants below? Our Acting President Li and Premier He resolutely rejected it on the 20th of this month, and our party center also issued a statement on the same day to explain to the people of the country that our party cannot accept this kind of cruel condition that exceeds the scope of peace negotiations and harms the foundation of the people's lives and the country, and still hopes that the Chinese Communist Party will pull back from the precipice, lay down its butcher knife, and the two sides will first order a ceasefire and conduct another reasonable negotiation to achieve true and lasting peace. However, the Chinese Communist Party ignored everything and openly issued an attack order on the 21st. Under the eyes of the whole country, which is eager for peace, it launched a large army and continued to invade, forcibly crossing the river, attempting to sweep across Nanjing and Shanghai and conquer the whole country. In order to redeploy its defense lines for long-term resistance, our government was forced to temporarily avoid the fierce attack and withdraw from Nanjing, while simultaneously moving the entire government to Guangzhou to re-establish the source of resistance. To save the country and protect the party, we will continue the war in order to seek justice and the realization of lasting peace. All our comrades should know that the purpose of the Premier's founding of our party is to realize the Three Principles of the People, and observing the evolution of the world in the 20th century has proved that the Three Principles of the People contain the truth of human life today. It is not only sufficient as the foundation for our country's establishment, but also can be the direction for world peace. The Founding Father once told us that what the revolutionary party relies on for its survival is not military force or money, but the truth of ideology and morality. Our party has experienced thousands of setbacks and hardships in the past ten years, but it has been able to become more and more courageous and make continuous efforts, all thanks to the truth being on our side. Our party once led the people to overthrow the autocracy of the Qing Dynasty, eliminate the rampant warlords, and repel the invasion of Japan. All our comrades who died later who participated in these three battles, now that the Chinese Communist Party is trying to eliminate the history of our party, how can we fear its temporary military superiority and submit to humiliating surrender? We are now doing this to prevent the country and nation from becoming a vassal state of a totalitarian state, to prevent compatriots across the country from falling into the tragic situation of slavery, and to prevent the tragedy of mutual killing, liquidation, and struggle among the Chinese nation. There is only unity and adherence to the statement issued by the President on the 27th of this month, vowing to contend with the Chinese Communist Party, sharing the same hatred against the enemy, eliminating this evil, and ensuring that it no longer desires war and loves chaos. Comrades of our party have been influenced by revolutionary ideology. When the party and the country are in danger, we firmly believe that we will be able to rise up and be at the forefront of the people. Those who are familiar with military affairs will serve on the battlefield, those who have wealth will sacrifice their families to relieve the country's difficulties, those who can propagandize will awaken the people, and those who hold public office will strive for innovation. Where great righteousness lies, everyone should do their best. How can the Chinese Communist Party's military force exceed that of the Japanese invaders? Our party is capable of leading the people to defeat them. This is the confidence that our party should have, and there is no need to be discouraged in the slightest. As for the disputes that have arisen in our party over the past twenty years, and the conflicts between comrades due to differences in opinions and rights, creating certain factions, and personal grievances and rights and wrongs, at this time of life-and-death struggle and clear battle lines, we should all arouse our conscience, abandon our private hatreds, unite as one, and work hard under the leadership of our party to protect the country and the people. There are some comrades who have a deep revolutionary enthusiasm, but have been dissatisfied with the party and government measures over the years, or have made excessive remarks and actions. Now that they see the Chinese Communist Party is so dictatorial, those who have a little conscience should realize and return to the great banner of the Three Principles of the People. Those who are willing to contribute their revolutionary sincerity, love the country and are loyal to the party, who will be late to join? In order to guarantee the implementation of the Three Principles of the People and to save the country and the nation from danger, we can only unite in spirit and work hard to be worthy of the spirits of the Premier and the martyrs. The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, April 28, 1949."

### Chamber of Commerce Asks Central Bank to Provide Emergency Industrial Loans

And to Provide Cash for Payrolls

If your bank does not provide emergency industrial loans to support us, we fear that we will ultimately be unable to maintain operations.

We also request that your bank do its best to find a solution."

### Approved in Municipal Government Meeting, Tax Exemption Standard for Banquets

### Postal Rates Increase Today, 40,000 for Each Regular Letter

In order to maintain operations and balance income and expenses, the Post Office will restore the pre-war standard of 80% of the fees starting today (the 30th). The pre-war postage for a regular letter was 5 fen per letter, and 80% of that is 4 fen. If calculated at the current prices, the postage for a regular letter exceeds 80,000 Gold Yuan per letter. In order to reduce the burden on the public, the rate will be rounded down and temporarily set at 40,000. Before the war, the postage for each regular letter could buy five large cakes. The current price of each large cake is 10,000, so the postage for a regular letter should be 50,000. Charging 80% of that would be 40,000, which matches the other calculation. The fees for other types of mail will be calculated proportionally, and international postage will also be adjusted at the same time. As for the rumor that postage will be priced in silver dollars, that is not true. The detailed fees that have been obtained are as follows: "Domestic" Letters: 40,000 for every 20 grams, Postcards (single): 20,000, (double): 40,000. Registered letters: Add 120,000 in addition to the regular fees; Express registered: Add 160,000; Regular express: Add 40,000; Airmail: Add 60,000. "International Mail" Letters: 100,000 for the first 20 grams; Postcards (single): 60,000, (double): 120,000; Airmail: Add 300,000 for every 10 grams in addition to the regular fees.

### Rice Supply Dwindles and Prices Rise, Flour, Oil, and Coarse Grains All Increase in Value

### National Banks and Bureaus Issue 500,000 and 1 Million Denomination Banknotes to Meet Payroll Needs, Gold Exchange for Silver Dollars Will Still Be Handled

[Report from this Newspaper] According to a responsible person at the Central Bank who met with reporters yesterday, there should be no problem in meeting the cash needs for payrolls at the end of this month. In addition, national banks and bureaus, such as the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, have issued fixed-denomination banknotes of 500,000 and 1 million to make up for the shortage of cash, and the Central Bank has also begun to issue them simultaneously. According to regulations, these banknotes are considered equivalent to cash and are circulated in full without any discount, just like cash. Supplemented by the recently issued large-denomination banknotes of 100,000, it is hoped that there will be sufficient chips to meet the payroll needs of all sectors of society.

As for the restoration of the method of exchanging gold for silver dollars, there is no problem in principle, but it still depends on whether various manufacturers have this need. It is estimated that the cash needed for payrolls at the end of this month is approximately 2 trillion. If national banks fully supply the cash, the need for silver dollars in various sectors may not be very urgent. If there is a need, national banks will still handle it according to the method of exchanging gold for silver dollars in the middle of this month, but the exchange rate will be determined temporarily.

### Gold Soars, Silver Dollars Rise Madly

Due to the Central Bank's large denomination banknotes of 500,000 being issued in large quantities, and rumors that 500,000 and 1,000,000 banknotes had already been printed, people were restless and anxious.

The price outside the exchange started at 8,200, then 8,700 in the morning, and by 11:00 AM, it had broken through the 100 million mark, rising to 130 million and 140 million at noon closing.
