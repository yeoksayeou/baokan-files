### Please Request He Yingqin and Gu Mengyu to Form a New Cabinet; Acting President Li is Actively Urging; Gan Jiehou and Qiu Changwei Pass Through Shanghai to Hangzhou

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] Acting President Li's intended candidates for the new premier have not yet been in Nanjing, so the work of seeking their consent will have to be delayed for a day or two before a decision can be made. It is said that there were important consultations at the official residence of Acting President Li Hougang on the evenings of the 8th and 9th, and long-distance telephone calls between Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou were also frequent. As of the evening of the 9th, according to reliable information obtained, Acting President Li still intends to invite Mr. He Yingqin to form a cabinet, while Mr. Gu Mengyu is the second candidate. Sources close to Acting President Li revealed on the evening of the 9th that, given the seriousness of the current situation, the candidates for the new cabinet must be able to satisfy all parties. If He and Gu are nominated, they will surely receive support from both the government and the public. The most ideal situation would be for both of them to join the cabinet, either with He Yingqin as premier and Gu Mengyu as vice premier and concurrently minister of education, or with Gu Mengyu as premier and He Yingqin as vice premier and concurrently minister of national defense. If such a combination could be achieved, it would be a blessing for the country. Gan Jiehou and Qiu Changwei are going to Shanghai and Hangzhou respectively to persuade them to take on the task. According to our reporter's reliable sources, He Yingqin and Gu Mengyu have already agreed, but both have attached conditions, hoping to have the actual power of a responsible cabinet and the freedom to decide on all cabinet members. It is generally believed that these conditions are not insurmountable. Acting President Li is considering them, and if there are no problems, the new cabinet is expected to appear with a brand-new and strong lineup.

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch of the 9th] Acting President Li is satisfied with He Yingqin's willingness to form a new cabinet and has expressed this intention to He. He has also consulted with He twice via long-distance telephone from Nanjing on the matter of forming a cabinet. However, it is still difficult to know whether Mr. He has already accepted the appointment. It is generally believed that Mr. He is still in the midst of considering it. He arrived in Hangzhou on the 8th with his wife and son and is currently residing in Tang Enbo's residence on the inner West Lake. This morning, he took a walk along the lakeside with his son, and in the afternoon, he took a boat to tour the Three Pools Mirroring the Moon and the Lake Heart Pavilion in West Lake, appearing relaxed and carefree. Provincial Chairman Zhou Shu accompanied him on the tour. Although Acting President Li's special plane and representative Qiu Changwei have already arrived in Hangzhou to welcome him, there is no sign that Mr. He will immediately go to Nanjing to form a cabinet. Mr. He's birthday is on the 12th, and it is possible that he will still follow his original plan to avoid celebrating his birthday in Hangzhou before going to Nanjing. It is also said that he may go to Xikou within the next few days.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] Youth Party leader Li Huang is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing by train from Shanghai on the morning of the 10th. Mr. Li flew to Shanghai from Chengdu on the 8th. This trip to Nanjing is at the invitation of Acting President Li to offer his opinions on the current state of affairs. It is reported that the new cabinet lineup will still invite friendly parties to assist in cooperation.

[News Dispatch] Gan Jiehou arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning with a mandate from Nanjing to persuade He Yingqin and Gu Mengyu to form a new cabinet. After visiting relevant figures in the morning, he immediately traveled to Hangzhou in the same car as Qiu Changwei to convey Acting President Li's intentions to He Yingqin. Mr. Gan visited Yan Cheqing yesterday morning to discuss peace talks and also touched upon the matter of forming a cabinet. It is reported that Mr. Gan expressed that after the formation of the cabinet is completed, the peace movement can be expected to make new progress, because the problem with the government in the past was the inconsistency of opinions on the current situation. In the future, the will will be concentrated, and peace talks will be carried out with all efforts. It is learned that Qiu Changwei visited Gu Mengyu in Shanghai and had a long conversation with him. According to insiders, it is very likely that Mr. He will form a cabinet, because after the resignation of the Weng cabinet last autumn, the authorities originally intended to rely on him. At that time, Mr. He proposed two plans for political and economic reform and disarmament. The latter planned to reduce the national army by three million people to save treasury expenditures. This opinion was not accepted at the time, so Mr. He expressed no intention to form a cabinet. It is reported that Acting President Li expressed his full agreement with these two plans, so it is highly likely that Mr. He will form a cabinet.

[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] Newspapers here believe that Acting President Li is determined to have General He Yingqin form a cabinet, with Shao Xiong as his deputy. It is heard that Mr. He strongly advocates using the policies of the British Labour Party as a blueprint to implement socialism in China, while at the same time strengthening the power of local organizations, so that after the Communist Party controls the coalition government, the Kuomintang can still maintain some influence in the localities.

### Sun Ke and Others to Return to Guangzhou Immediately to Handle the Closing and Handover Matters

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] After the Sun cabinet's collective resignation was approved, Premier Sun, in order to expedite the handover, has decided to return to Guangzhou within the next few days with Vice Premier Wu Tiecheng and the heads of various ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan, to discuss the political affairs of handling the closing and handover matters. It has also been decided to hold a political conference in Guangzhou within the next few days. This conference will be the last conference of the Sun cabinet, so Sun, Wu, and others must rush back to preside over it. The heads of various ministries and commissions currently in Nanjing, including Hong Lanyou, Zhong Tianxin, Xu Kan, Liu Weizhi, Pang Songzhou, Wu Shangying, Guan Jiyu, and Chen Xueping, will all return to Guangzhou within a day or two to expedite the handover. The reason why the handover must be handled in Guangzhou is that the seal of the Executive Yuan is now in Guangzhou, and the official documents, files, and dossiers of various ministries and commissions have all been moved to Guangzhou. After handling the handover, Premier Sun will return to his hometown of Hanmen to visit his elderly mother. It is expected that Sun will stay in Hong Kong for a short period of time to recuperate. Executive Yuan Secretary-General Duanmu Kai, Minister of Water Resources Zhong Tianxin, and Acting Minister of Communications Ling Hongxun took the night train to Shanghai on the 9th to wait for a flight back to Guangzhou to expedite the handover. At 4 p.m. on the 9th, Premier Sun invited Xu Yongchang, Gu Zhutong, Weng Wenhao, Xu Kan, and others to a meeting at the Executive Yuan's No. 1 official residence to discuss issues such as reducing military spending and verifying military expenses, which lasted for about an hour before adjourning.

### Central Organs in Guangzhou Have Not Yet Received Orders to Move North

[United Press Guangzhou Dispatch of the 9th] Officials, both Chinese and foreign, here today all believe that Premier Sun Ke's resignation does not mean that the National Government will immediately return to Nanjing. According to some embassy staff, it is expected that they will remain in Guangzhou for at least two more months. Whether or not to return to Nanjing will largely depend on the success or failure of the peace talks.

[Associated Press Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy stated that there are currently no plans to recall the American diplomatic personnel who accompanied the Executive Yuan to Guangzhou.

[Reuters Guangzhou Dispatch of the 9th] The Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan recently denied rumors circulating domestically that orders have already been issued for government agencies to move back to Nanjing from Guangzhou. He said that any decision on this matter must wait until the new premier of the Executive Yuan is appointed before it can be made. He personally believes that the central organs in Guangzhou may not move back to Nanjing, firstly because Nanjing is not safe, and secondly because many of the original sites of the organs in Nanjing are occupied by the military, and it is impossible to vacate them in a short time.

### Chen Jitang Arrives in Nanjing; Chen Cheng and Others to Arrive Within Days

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] Acting President Li invited military and political leaders from various parts of the Southeast to Nanjing to solicit their opinions on the state of the nation. Chen Jitang, Administrative Chief of Hainan Island, arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 9th in response to the call and immediately met with Acting President Li in the morning for a long talk. Taiwan Chairman Chen Cheng has not yet departed due to administrative meetings. Acting President Li specially dispatched a special plane to meet him on the 9th, and it is expected that Mr. Chen will come to Nanjing within a day or two. As for Fujian Chairman Zhu Shaoliang, Guangdong Chairman Xue Yue, and Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters Director Yu Hanmou, there is still no definite date for their arrival in Nanjing. Mr. Chen Jitang flew to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 8th, accompanied by Lin Yizhong, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters. When Chen and Lin arrived in Nanjing by train from Shanghai on the morning of the 9th, Bai Chongxi, Li Hanhun, Li Yuqing, and others were all at the station to welcome them.

[Our Taipei Dispatch of the 9th] Acting President Li sent a telegram inviting Chen Cheng to Nanjing. Mr. Chen should be able to make the trip within two or three days.

[Our Lanzhou Dispatch of the 9th] According to information obtained here, Acting President Li sent a telegram to Ma Hongkui, guaranteeing that he would come to Nanjing for a meeting before the 17th. Mr. Ma will fly directly from Ningxia to Nanjing in the near future. The special plane to welcome Mr. Ma will arrive in Ningxia in a day or two. In addition, Mr. Ma's diabetes has not improved. After attending a certain meeting in Nanjing, he will go to Shanghai and Hong Kong for treatment.

### The Drafting Committee for Political Reform Proposals Holds Its First Meeting in the Legislative Yuan; Believes That Administrative Organs Should Be Substantially Streamlined and Merged

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] The Drafting Committee for Political Reform Proposals of the Legislative Yuan held its first meeting at 9 a.m. on the 9th. More than 40 members attended. Chairman Zou Shuwen presided over the meeting. The members spoke one after another, discussing various aspects of the current political system and personnel policies. They all advocated that the Legislative Yuan, as an organ of power, should also be an organ of decision-making. If the rule of law is to be implemented, the functions of the Legislative Yuan must be exercised. Administrative organs are too redundant and complex, and should be substantially streamlined and merged, redundant personnel should be eliminated, the employment security of civil servants should be determined, the functions of various organs should be clearly defined, local power should be increased, and the central government should not interfere in everything. Some people also advocated sending several legislators to Xikou to meet with President Chiang to discuss the matter. No conclusion was reached by 12 noon, and it was decided to continue the meeting at 9 a.m. on the 10th to discuss it further.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] The Drafting Committee for Peace Proposals of the Legislative Yuan held its first meeting at 9 a.m. on the 9th. More than 30 members attended, with Huang Yuren as chairman. It was suggested to hold a closed meeting, so all reporters were barred from the door. The discussion was lively, and many people spoke. They all believed that peace was a pressing need for the people, and the Legislative Yuan should strive for peace that is beneficial to the people. It was decided to appoint Jiang Yiping, Yang Yuqing, Lu Yuwen, Zhang Yiwen, and Huang Yuren to be responsible for drafting a statement of opinions, with Huang Yuren as the writer. The five-member group will hold a meeting at 10 a.m. on the 10th to study it, and then discuss it at the second meeting of the Drafting Committee at 3 p.m. on the 10th before reporting it to the general assembly. The meeting adjourned at 12 noon.

### Preliminary Draft of the Peace Talks Plan Completed; Willing to Make the Greatest Sacrifice to Alleviate People's Hardships; Particularly Emphasizes the Future International Status

Sun Ke Convenes a Ten-Member Committee

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] The preliminary opinions on the government's peace talks plan were finally discussed and summarized by the ten-member drafting committee convened by Sun Ke on the morning of the 9th. The initial draft of the record of these opinions was submitted to Acting President Li on the afternoon of the 9th. In addition to the counterproposals based on the CCP's eight conditions, which have been repeatedly reported in previous dispatches, according to well-informed sources, it also includes some new opinions that cannot be summarized within the CCP's eight conditions. Most of these opinions are of a diplomatic nature, that is, what kind of status China will have internationally after the establishment of the future coalition government. Referring to precedents, the opinions specifically point out that it should maintain its independence and must not be a dependency of any country. As for some specific issues in the CCP's eight conditions, when the members of the government's drafting of the peace plan exchanged opinions, they were willing to make the greatest sacrifices and concessions for anything that would help to realize true and lasting peace, in order to end the years of turmoil and alleviate the suffering of the people. The ten-member drafting committee convened by Sun Ke on the 9th was held at the Executive Yuan's No. 1 official residence at 10 a.m. Those who attended included Shao Lizi, Wu Tiecheng, Zhang Qun, Zhong Tianxin, Zhu Jiahua, Liu Fei, and others. They conducted a detailed review of the preliminary opinions on the peace plan. At the same time, because Sun, Wu, Zhong, and others will go to Guangzhou to expedite the handover and cannot continue to draft a formal plan, it was decided to first submit it to Acting President Li, and then wait for He Yingqin, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Zhongxin, and others to return before Acting President Li decides whether to add additional drafting members or discuss it again.

[Our Dispatch] A certain peace representative returned to Shanghai from Nanjing and spoke at length about the current situation, saying that as of this time, the opinions on peace talks within the Kuomintang have not yet been unified. The collective resignation of the Sun cabinet is regrettable in terms of the overall situation and peace talks, because if the Sun cabinet did not resign, it could at least share the worries of the acting president. Today, he must bear the heavy burden alone. As far as peace talks are concerned, everything must wait until the cabinet is formed and the representatives are officially produced before they can proceed. The timing may be slightly later than expected. As far as I know, the CCP's lineup for peace talks has long been internally decided, so whether or not the peace talks can be held at an early date depends on the government. In recent days, the communist army has been deploying troops north of the Yangtze River with a strong intention to fight, but I personally believe that the purpose is to put on a show of force to create a psychological effect and prevent them from crossing the river suddenly. Otherwise, the impact on the CCP's credibility would be too great. In the consultations in Beiping, the communist side only pointed out that it is acceptable to take the eight points as a prerequisite for negotiations or as a basis for negotiations. I have not heard of any requirement to control Nanjing and Shanghai as a prerequisite for peace talks. I personally believe that the core issue of peace talks is not here.

### Ministry of National Defense Appoints Li Zhuoyuan as Commander of the Humen Fortress

[Central News Agency Guangzhou Dispatch of the 9th] According to Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters, the Ministry of National Defense has recently appointed Li Zhuoyuan as Commander of the Humen Fortress.

### Mao Zedong Has Not Arrived in Beiping

[Associated Press This City Dispatch] According to news from Beiping, it was once rumored in late February that CCP Chairman Mao Zedong had arrived in Beiping, but Mr. Mao has definitely not arrived in Beiping yet. As of now, the highest-ranking figure of the CCP in Beiping is Peng Dehuai, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army.

### National Army in Shaanxi Recovers Fuping; Red Spear Society in Southern Henan Attacks and Enters Tongbai City; No Major Changes on the Northern Jiangsu Battlefield

[Central News Agency Xi'an Dispatch of the 9th] The Political Work Office of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters issued a battle report on the 9th: The National Army recovered Fuping at 10 a.m. on the 9th, and the communist army fled in confusion towards Pucheng and Yaoxian.

[Our Xinyang Dispatch of the 9th] Reliable information: More than 70,000 members of the Red Spear Society, spontaneously organized by the people of Southern Henan, are launching large-scale attacks on local communists in the border area between Henan and Hubei due to the communist army's forced conscription of military rations. According to news this afternoon, more than 10,000 members of the Red Spear Society attacked and entered Tongbai County (within Henan Province) at 9 a.m. this morning and seized more than 100,000 catties of communist army rations, more than 4,000 rifles, more than 40 submachine guns, more than 17 light machine guns, and more than 200 pistols in Caodian and other places.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 9th] There are no major changes on the Northern Jiangsu battlefield. The communist army naturally has its own necessary preparations for future crossing-the-river operations, and how the National Army can further consolidate the defenses of the Yangtze River is also an important issue. The recent Changzhou Pacification Conference convened under the chairmanship of Tang Enbo, as well as Tang's inspection of the river defenses, can all serve as footnotes to the above situation.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 9th] In order to prevent the communist army from crossing the river secretly, in addition to strengthening the bridgehead forces on the north bank of the Yangtze River, the Dagang area under Zhenjiang County was taken over by a certain unit of the National Army on the 9th.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 9th] The 90th Division of the Fourth Army stationed in Zhenjiang is scheduled to conduct live-fire exercises with mortars and machine guns on the lawn of Die Wan Gao Yi at noon on the 10th.

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch of the 9th] It is rumored that the military has declared a blockade of the Yangtze River downstream. Our reporter specifically visited the army and navy authorities here to inquire about this. According to them, the so-called "blockade" only means that the military has imposed control over shipping between certain ports on the north and south banks of the Yangtze River. All civilian ships or commercial ships can sail between ports permitted by the military and at designated times. Navigation up and down the river is not restricted by this ban. Military personnel also stated that the blockade of the Yangtze River will be decided based on the evolution of the military situation, and there is currently no need to take this measure.

[Central News Agency Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] Naval Headquarters reported: On the evening of the 7th, a small group of communist troops attempted to move near the Longwo area bridgehead, 200 meters north of the downstream ports of the Yangtze River. The invading communist troops were repelled by our joint army and navy cooperation. Communist troops in the Tianxingqiao area southwest of Taixing have been extremely busy building fortifications for days, which were completely destroyed by heavy artillery fire from the navy.

[Reuters Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] A telephone call from Zhenjiang stated that 3,000 communist troops attacked Yizheng City on the north bank of the Yangtze River under the cover of artillery fire on the night of the 8th. By the morning of the 9th, they had been repelled, with approximately 400 communist casualties. Military personnel declined to disclose the exact situation in Guazhou on the north bank.

### Ted Tun Arrives in Qingdao

[Our Qingdao Dispatch of the 9th] The newly appointed Shandong Chairman and Qingdao Mayor Zhai Decun arrived in Qingdao from Shanghai by China National Aviation Corporation plane on the 9th. His entourage included only the Director of the Provincial Government Information Office, Yin Dianjia, and an aide-de-camp. Liu Anqi, Gong Xuesui, Lin Yifang, and senior personnel from the Pacification Zone and the Municipal Government, as well as 200 representatives from all walks of life, welcomed him at the airport.

[Our Qingdao Dispatch of the 9th] It is rumored that the current Commander of the Eleventh Pacification Zone, Liu Anqi, will be transferred to the position of Deputy Commander of the Taiwan Provincial Garrison.

### Gong Debai Resumes Writing Commentary

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] Gong Debai, the chief writer of the Jiuguo Daily, has been released and resumed writing commentary as usual on the 9th. The newspaper has been republished after being suspended for three days.

[Associated Press New York Dispatch of the 8th] The New York Herald Tribune editorialized on the 8th, stating: "The editor of the Nanjing Jiuguo Daily, Xi Debai, was banned from writing commentary. His courage in expressing this in Kuomintang territory only resulted in a short imprisonment. If he had expressed the same barbarity in the Communist Party area and suggested that Mao Zedong go abroad, the consequences would have been much more serious. The Chinese National Government's record on freedom of speech is not perfect, but it is better than the Communist Party's. It is doubtful whether Western government theories can take root in China when most Chinese people do not have enough food to survive."

### The Legislative Yuan to Continue Discussing the Proposal to Stop Conscription and Levy of Grain Today; The Proposal to Simplify Administrative Organs is Also on the Agenda

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] The fourth meeting of the third session of the Legislative Yuan is scheduled to be held at 9 a.m. on the 11th. The agenda will still follow the old example and be arranged by the Program Committee. However, if Acting President Li can propose candidates for the premiership of the Executive Yuan at that time, the agenda will be changed to vote on their approval. On the agenda for the 11th, the report items include a letter from the Secretariat of the Control Yuan informing that the annual meeting of the Yuan for the 38th year of the Republic is scheduled to be held in Nanjing on March 12th. In addition to continuing to discuss the proposal by Huang Tong and 33 others to quickly stop conscription and levy of grain, the only new item listed is the proposal by Chen Guyuan and others to simplify administrative organs and first amend Article 3 of the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan.

### Chen Guyuan and Others Propose to Retain Eleven Ministries

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] Amidst the reorganization of the Executive Yuan and the government's preparation to streamline institutions, legislator Chen Guyuan and 46 others recently proposed "In order to simplify administrative organs, first amend Article 3 of the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan," advocating that the original 18 ministries and commissions of the Executive Yuan be simplified to 11 ministries and commissions. The rest should be merged into other ministries and commissions or change their organization and be subordinate to the Executive Yuan or other ministries and commissions. The proposal argues that the following 11 ministries and commissions should be retained: (1) Ministry of the Interior, (2) Ministry of Foreign Affairs, (3) Ministry of National Defense, (4) Ministry of Finance, (5) Ministry of Education, (6) Ministry of Judicial Administration, (7) Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (intended to be merged with the farmland irrigation business of the Ministry of Water Resources, so it exists), (8) Ministry of Industry and Commerce (without intending to incorporate the business of the Resources Committee, and with the existence of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, there is no need to restore the name of the Ministry of Economy or the Ministry of Industry), (9) Ministry of Communications, (10) Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission (related to border administration, so it exists), (11) Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission (related to overseas Chinese, so it exists). The seven ministries and commissions that should be reorganized and merged are: (1) Ministry of Social Affairs (for labor business, a labor bureau should be established under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, and the remaining business should be merged with the Department of Rites and Customs of the Ministry of the Interior and renamed the Department of Social Affairs), (2) Ministry of Water Resources (should be merged into relevant institutions according to the nature of its business, such as the farmland irrigation part being transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the transportation water conservancy part being transferred to the Ministry of Communications, etc.), (3) Ministry of Land Administration (should be renamed the Land Administration Bureau, depending on the complexity of its business, it should be directly under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan or directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Interior), (4) Ministry of Health (should be renamed the Health Department under the Ministry of the Interior), (5) Ministry of Food (related to the policy of conscription and borrowing in kind, since conscription and borrowing have been stopped, the remaining business of conscription in kind does not need to be a ministry. It should be renamed the Land Tax Department and transferred to the Ministry of Finance, and the business that cannot be transferred should be handled by relevant agencies), (6) Resources Committee (should remain its name and be directly under the Executive Yuan, so as to avoid being affected by political tides), (7) Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics (is a purely business agency, and the chief officer does not need to participate in the decision-making of political affairs. It should be renamed the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and its status should be the same as the News Bureau directly under the Executive Yuan, and there is no need to stipulate it in the Organic Law of the Executive Yuan).

### American Reporter Visits Xikou; Stays for Two Days Without Seeing Special Precautions; According to Those Contacted, President Chiang Has Left the Political Circle

[Associated Press China Branch President Gao Erya Xikou Dispatch of the 8th] Sun Ke's resignation on the 8th was not a surprising event for the few people in the village of Huanshan here who were once officials of President Chiang. People who have close contact with the president, although they said that Sun Ke's resignation had been expected for a long time, were unwilling to comment on the impact on the peace movement. The people this reporter contacted in Xikou in the past two days all unanimously declared that President Chiang had ordered them to take the same position as when they left Nanjing with him on January 22, that is, they had left the Chinese political circle. But informally, these people—about half the number of people who accompanied Chiang to Xikou—agreed that Sun Ke's Executive Yuan had many areas that needed improvement in the peace movement, which was the reason why Chiang resigned as president. President Chiang himself is practically completely separated from formal contact with the outside world. He rarely receives guests and requires senior officials with important matters. Zhang Zhizhong, the government's peace representative and possible successor to Sun Ke, was the most recent visitor, who went to Xikou on the 6th. President Chiang now has only two personal attendants—an aide-de-camp and a secretary—who handle all his affairs. One of them, in response to an Associated Press question about whether Chiang was still involved in politics and military affairs, said, "How can he? Only using a secretary"? He also flatly denied the rumors that Chiang was still issuing orders. Chiang does not spend his time in contemplation and meditation. He goes out for walks almost every day. One person said, "He makes our legs sore. He climbs mountains and floats in the river on bamboo rafts. He takes hiking trips and makes us go with him." There are few signs of special military precautions here. This reporter was not stopped once on the 35-mile trip from Ningbo to Xikou. Chiang has about 20 guards in total, and there are no signs of regular troops stationed.

### Discussions with Tao Xisheng at Guangzhou

[Report from our Guangzhou Bureau, 8th] Tao Xisheng, Deputy Minister of the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department, stated during a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters on the 8th, in response to inquiries: After President Chiang's retirement, he would support Vice President Li as a private citizen and had no intention of resuming his post. Whether there would be peace or war in the future would be decided by Acting President Li and the responsible cabinet. He currently resides at Xizhai, acting entirely as a common citizen. The Constitution stipulates that citizens have freedom of residence, religion, assembly, association, speech, and publication. Kuomintang members also have the freedom to accept the leadership of President Chiang. However, this does not constitute interference in politics. The National Revolutionary Army of China has been led by President Chiang for over twenty years. His concern for the lives of soldiers is only natural. However, since he no longer holds the presidential office, all military matters are commanded by Acting President Li and the Chief of Staff. The Kuomintang has long handed over the army to the state. The current forces are national armies, not party armies, and President Chiang has no power to command them. He also stated that he believed President Chiang would not come to Guangzhou, Beijing, or Taiwan recently, and all rumors to the contrary were malicious fabrications. He further mentioned that President Chiang's past political measures might not all have been correct, but his contributions to the country from the Northern Expedition to the victory in the War of Resistance should be remembered. Apart from the Communist Party, no one could deny his contributions to the country. When a reporter asked why some orders issued by Acting President Li after taking office, such as the release of Zhang Xueliang, could not be smoothly implemented, he replied: According to the Constitution, the President has the power, and the Cabinet has the responsibility. Orders issued by President Chiang in the past had to be approved by the Executive Yuan before being promulgated by the President. However, Acting President Li's statement and orders on January 24th had not been fully communicated with the Executive Yuan, leading to some misunderstandings. Furthermore, Acting President Li's statement that he accepted Mao Zedong's eight conditions in principle has caused some people to suspect that he will seek peace or surrender. Regarding the peace talks, he stated that it depended on whether the Communist Party was truly sincere. The National Army is currently only in a defensive position. The progress of the peace talks would still be decided in Nanjing, and he predicted that the process might take a very long time. Finally, in response to a question about whether the Kuomintang would be reorganized internally, he said that most comrades hoped for effective reform.

### Editorial: New Shanghai Rent Standards

To ensure the fairness and rationality of the new rent standards being drafted, the Shanghai Municipal Land Administration Bureau convened a meeting on the 8th of this month, gathering representatives from the Tenants' Union, the Real Estate Trade Association, and relevant industrial and commercial authorities to exchange views on the new rent standards. It is reported that the consultation resulted in the adoption of two principles: (1) The new standards will be based on Article 97 of the Land Law; (2) Rents will be calculated based on the cost of living index published twice a month, but the base will be discounted heavily compared to pre-war levels, and repair costs will be borne by the tenants. At the same time, all parties hoped that the new standards would be flexible, avoiding rigid regulations and striving to reduce disputes. The Land Administration Bureau is now revising the draft new rent standards based on the above opinions, and it is expected to be completed in the shortest possible time. Once reviewed by the Municipal Council and submitted to the Municipal Assembly for discussion, it can be finalized.

The abnormal panic regarding housing in Shanghai has affected both tenants and the real estate industry, leading to a unanimous demand for reasonable adjustments. The Land Administration Bureau is drafting new rent standards to meet the demands of all parties and to reasonably resolve the abnormal housing shortage, which is not only necessary but also a very good intention. What is worth discussing now is whether the new standards are reasonable and whether they can break through the abnormal housing shortage.

The urban housing shortage is a serious phenomenon that occurred after the war, and it concerns the housing problem of the people. This is not unique to Shanghai, nor is it unique to Chinese cities. After the war, governments in various countries fulfilled their responsibilities in legislation and administration to solve the housing problem for the people and society. American cities were not bombed, but men and women got married during the war. Once demobilized, husbands returned home and hoped to have a new home, so a housing shortage occurred in the United States. Congress paid attention to it, the government cared about it, and they used their power to solve it. Now the United States has no serious housing shortage. In Moscow, Ukraine, and Belarus, the people were displaced during the war. The Soviet government quickly paid attention to it, and before completing the disarmament of the German army, they built new houses on the ruins. The Soviet people today have no worries about a shortage of housing. Britain did not build houses during the war, and the dilapidated ones could not be repaired, and the destroyed ones were waiting to be demolished. As a result, London experienced a serious housing shortage after the war. However, since the Labor Party came to power, it has regarded the people's housing problem as being as important and urgent as the nationalization bill. Therefore, in the year since the Labor Party came to power, it has passed three major bills in Congress, making planned construction and encouraging private construction. Local governments have also established rent arbitration tribunals under the "Rent Restriction" bill, resolving many rental disputes. Even in Japan, a defeated country, the bombed areas of Tokyo have been rebuilt, and the construction of the ruins of Hiroshima is progressing even faster. Foreign reporters who went to Hiroshima to visit were very surprised by the Japanese spirit of reconstruction. As mentioned above, regardless of whether a country won or lost the war, the governments of other countries have done something about the people's housing problem. Only the situation in China is an exception. Not only are most people displaced and homeless, but even the cities with the most houses have an abnormal housing shortage, and the situation in Shanghai is the most serious.

As mentioned above, the Shanghai housing shortage is completely abnormal. According to some statistical analysis, Shanghai has a population of six million. If there is a reasonable method of allocating housing and a reasonable guarantee of rent, everyone should have suitable housing. Today, the owners who hold real estate in Shanghai have very little income, which directly prevents their legal property from being protected, and indirectly makes no individual or company willing to invest in building houses in the future. On the other hand, truly law-abiding tenants cannot legally obtain reasonable housing leases. Among these two, only "second landlords" can manipulate everything, obtaining gold, foreign exchange, or rice from rent leases, thus creating an unprecedented housing shortage. Market speculators are unwilling to invest in real estate. Although the real estate industry had a moment of prosperity and trading at the beginning of the issuance of gold yuan coupons, it quickly lost interest, which is completely different from the situation before the war. The enemy and puppet houses that were taken over are occupied by powerful people. No one has ever interfered with this dark and unclear phenomenon. It is said that even today, there are still people illegally occupying houses, not paying the purchase price, not paying rent, and using them openly. This unreasonable phenomenon has been developing for more than three years, but has not been resolved. Real estate owners are asking the government to adjust rent standards according to the Land Law to obtain legal income; tenants are under the pressure of rent disputes, organized the Tenants' Union, and asked the government to restrict rent increases and protect their residential interests. The Land Administration Bureau, under the pressure of both sides, drafted a new draft rent standards for the sake of their duties, and is prepared to promulgate it immediately after all parties agree. This should be done, I am afraid that it cannot be delayed any longer!

To solve the urban housing shortage and adjust reasonable rental relationships, the National Government promulgated a "Housing Lease Ordinance" on December 1, 1947, which is a very good social legislation. If Shanghai can implement it administratively, Shanghai's abnormal housing shortage can indeed be eliminated. Unfortunately, the Shanghai Municipal Government does not attach much importance to it, and has no courage to implement it. The Shanghai Municipal Assembly also avoids touching on this troublesome issue amid a variety of opinions, so the 7,000-fold and 9,000-fold standards set in March last year are nominally suspended. The government and public opinion organs are really irresponsible! Now the two principles passed by the Land Administration Bureau, the first one is to set new standards based on Article 97 of the Land Law, that is, the rent should not exceed 10% of the annual interest of the total declared value of the land and its buildings, which will satisfy the owners of the Real Estate Trade Association, because their property income can be expected to be guaranteed. Secondly, the second one is to calculate the rent standard based on the cost of living index, and then give a very large discount, which is probably the opinion of the Tenants' Union. According to the Tenants' Union's suggestion, the new rent can be based on one yuan before the war converted into four or five cents, and then multiplied by the cost of living index. If this suggestion is adopted, the burden on tenants will not be too heavy. The opinions of the two sides seem to be able to be coordinated, but how to break through the intermediate substitution of houses, restrict the subletting of houses, so that everyone bears reasonable rent and legally and directly obtains the lease of houses, there is no decision, and it is still quite regrettable.

The housing shortage in Shanghai is indeed very serious and needs to be resolved thoroughly. No one opposes increasing rent and guaranteeing owners reasonable and legal income. Truly law-abiding tenants are also willing to abide by the contract. However, the creation of Shanghai's abnormal housing shortage today, which forces both owners and truly law-abiding tenants to suffer, is the illegal "second landlord" who specializes in subletting and replacing, and the group of people. If the "Housing Lease Ordinance" is not strictly implemented and subletting is banned, the bad wind of the housing shortage in Shanghai will still exist, and it will still be of no benefit to the people and society. The municipal authorities are urged to pay attention to this!

### The Pioneering "Land to the Tiller" Initiative: Longyan Completes Land Reform, the Entire County is Now Populated by Owner-Farmers, Begging and Theft Eliminated, Neighboring Six Counties Begin Similar Reforms

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th] Chiang Meng-lin, Chairman of the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction (JCRR), told reporters on the 9th that the JCRR has decided to allocate funds to subsidize the implementation of land reform in Longyan and other seven counties in western Fujian. This is a pioneering initiative in our country to implement land reform and achieve "land to the tiller". Chiang believes that the achievements of Longyan County in implementing land reform and the experimental work in the nearby six counties are the correct path that our country should take for land reform in the future, and the JCRR is now fully assisting in the promotion of this experiment. Chiang stated, "This measure by the JCRR will have a profound impact on the transformation and stabilization of China's current social economy and order." According to Chiang, Longyan County is the only region south of the Yangtze River that has completed land reform, and its reform achievements have begun to become significant. Chiang continued, "According to the results of this survey by our committee, the improvement of farmers' lives and agricultural production in the area has reached 20% compared to the year before the reform. The entire county is now populated by owner-farmers, and begging and theft have been eliminated. This achievement has induced landlords in other adjacent areas to welcome reform. The 7th District Commissioner's Office has now started the same land reform in Yongding, Wuping, and Shanghang counties, which are adjacent to Longyan. The other three counties of Changting, Tanping, and Liancheng will be included in the second phase and completed within one year." The reporter also learned that the JCRR has decided that the scope of assistance will be: (1) To maintain and expand the effects of land reform after it has been completed, the committee will allocate funds to Longyan County farmers to increase agricultural production, promote land utilization, and strengthen the economic status of owner-farmers, because the farmers in this area are all self-cultivating, so the various benefits generated by the aforementioned assistance will not be shared by landlords and will all be enjoyed by farmers. (2) To subsidize the implementation of reform funds for the other six counties that are implementing land reform, so that the land reform plan can be effectively implemented and quickly completed. The completed areas can also be subsidized according to the Longyan method to improve their agricultural production. The committee firmly believes that the assistance given in this way will enable farmers to directly benefit without being wasted.

### The Soviet Union Fully Supports Southern Country's Demands Negotiations on the Austrian Treaty are on the Verge of Collapse The West Insists that Austria's Border Cannot Be Changed

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 9th Radio: The Four Powers' Conference on the Austrian Treaty has entered its fifth week. Judging from the current situation, the negotiations are on the verge of collapse. The representatives have agreed to invite Bebler, the Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia, to attend the meeting again this Thursday to state his demands on Austria. If the Southern country still insists on demanding Austrian compensation and territorial concessions at that time, the meeting will inevitably fail.

The Soviet Union supports the Southern country's position, but the British and American laws have repeatedly stated that Austria's borders must not be changed. Today, the Soviet representative suggested organizing a working group to study the Austrian border issue, but it has been rejected by the three powers. The three powers then suggested setting up a working group to study other demands of the Southern country, but the case was overturned by the Soviet Union again. The Soviet representative, Charlypin, once again stated his support for the demands of the Southern country and asked the three powers to clearly express their opposition to border changes, which made the deadlock even more difficult to break. Western countries bluntly stated that if the Soviet Union cannot show a sincere intention to sign the treaty, then all negotiations are unlikely to succeed.

### Increasing the Effectiveness of Submarine Weapons Britain Pays Attention to Underwater Tactics Testing the Destructive Power of Atomic Radiation This Summer

[Reuters London, 8th Dispatch] When Secretary of the Navy Tug-Teyl submitted a supplementary naval budget of 20 million pounds to the House of Commons today, he said: Britain has made progress in researching a new type of submarine weapon, and hopes to install it on submarines for testing this year. In future wars, the Atlantic may be equal to the Mediterranean in the past, and the position of the British Isles will be similar to that of Malta. US Navy Secretary Sullivan recently said that in future wars, underwater warfare may be equal to the number of surface warfare, which is not an exaggeration. Modern submarines should be able to lie on the seabed for five weeks and reach a speed of 20 knots per hour. Britain is satisfied with this research, but we cannot be sure that other countries cannot obtain the same results. The British Navy believes that the nemesis of submarines is a small, fast cruiser. Britain currently has about 150 of these ships.

### Inside Story of the Mysterious Disappearance of China Airlines' Shanghai-Qingdao Flight Secret Mixing of Communist Personnel Forcing a Landing in Jinan Mid-flight The Pilots and Passengers Return to Shanghai Discussing the Detention Experience

[Our Newspaper Report] On January 30th of this year, China Airlines' C-47 model XT-135 Shanghai-Qingdao flight mysteriously landed in Jinan, a communist area, en route to Qingdao. For more than a month, there has been no news. Unexpectedly, until yesterday, all three crew members of the plane, pilot He Xueke, co-pilot Shu Zhilun, and telegraph operator Wang Qingyuan, returned safely to Shanghai from Qingdao on the company's flight. The remaining passengers also arrived safely in Qingdao the night before, but the 135 plane has been retained by the communist side for their own use.

According to the crew members who returned to Shanghai, the reason why the plane flew to Jinan was that there were communist personnel mixed in the plane and they were forced to land. After taking off that day, at around 11 am, just as the co-pilot and radio operator were distributing food boxes to the passengers, about five or six passengers suddenly drew pistols, threatened and monitored them. They forcibly entered the cockpit, drove out the main pilot, and drove themselves, immediately changing course to fly to Jinan. When arriving over Jinan, the driving passenger tried to land twice without success. Fortunately, the weather was clear that day, so a disaster was avoided. Finally, the co-pilot was forced to return to the cockpit to land the plane.

After disembarking, all the crew members and the remaining passengers were concentrated in the municipal government guest house for residence. During this period, they were treated kindly, but were not allowed to talk to or contact the outside world. This lasted until the 5th of this month, when they were allowed to set off and return to Qingdao. The journey took four days, and they took trains, cars, bicycles, and wheelbarrows. After arriving in the Qingdao area the night before, they were sent to Qingdao by a vehicle dispatched by the local garrison. All the luggage and other items of them and the passengers were returned and brought back.

### Qian Chengxu Issues Statement Regarding Material Exchanges Between the Kuomintang and the Communists: Only Conveying the Demands of the Industrial and Commercial Sectors to Merchants from Xuzhou and Huai'an; Success Is Possible Only with the Final Ruling of the Authorities

Regarding the issue of material exchange across the Yangtze River, the industrial and commercial sectors are paying close attention as the prosperity of the country depends on it; however, there are many misunderstandings from all sides. Qian Chengxu of the Export Promotion Office of the National Goods Ten Factories, specifically issued a supplementary statement yesterday, elaborating on the progress of this matter, stating: Last lunar new year, merchants from various places in Xuzhou, Huai'an, and northern Jiangsu heard that postal, navigational, and commercial links with North China had been realized. They came to Shanghai indirectly, intending to follow the example of merchants from both sides obtaining permission from their respective authorities to exchange coal, soybeans, and cotton from their areas for cotton cloth and industrial products from Jinghu (Nanjing and Shanghai). At the time, the person in question informed the merchants to first return to their local areas and negotiate with the Communist side. At the same time, this idea was conveyed to the Wujin and Wuxi Chambers of Commerce for discussion. Wujin was willing to provide cloth in exchange for soybeans and cotton because it produced cloth that used to be sold to 22 counties in Xuzhou, Huai'an, and northern Jiangsu, but sales have completely stopped due to the war, while edible oil is urgently needed. Wuxi, because the exchange port is designated as Jingwang, which is separated from Jiangyin by a river and accessible by road, can also exchange yarn and cloth for cotton and coal. As for the Capital Electric Power Plant, it used to use Huaibei coal, requiring more than 5,000 tons per month, and after the mine changed hands, the coal source became scarce. It planned to obtain coal supplies at Yuxikou in Anhui, via the Jingwu Road. Various industries in Shanghai hope to open Nantong as an exchange station for convenience. In short, this issue is related to the people's livelihood and economy and is extremely urgent; however, its promotion is difficult in terms of technology, personnel, and economy. It requires joint efforts from industry and commerce and can only be successful with the final permission and ruling of the authorities. The issue of protection is particularly important. If safety is not guaranteed, merchants will definitely not risk such danger. As for the reports in various newspapers that the Export Office of the National Goods Ten Factories has sent special personnel to Xuzhou and Huai'an for negotiations, the Export Office is only a promotional organization for national goods and does not have the qualifications to represent industry and commerce. It is only because of the frequent contact with merchants from Xuzhou and Huai'an who come to Shanghai that the demands of the industrial and commercial sectors here are conveyed, hoping to proceed in stages to promote its success.

### Public Opinion Survey Committee Collects Public Opinion; Sends Personnel for Door-to-Door Interviews

If citizens are unable to pay, their rice certificates are withheld. The Public Opinion Survey Committee has investigated and confirmed this matter, considering this measure to be contrary to the meaning of the rationing policy. The office has submitted letters to the Mayor and the Civil Affairs Bureau, requesting that they be ordered to stop this.

[Report from our newspaper] The coal shortage at the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau remains unresolved. The bureau's finances are still extremely tight, and it is fundamentally unable to purchase coal. The bureau chief, Wang Zhaohuai, went to Nanjing the other evening to request a solution from the Ministry of Transportation.

Another Report: To save coal consumption, the railway bureau has decided to suspend the 77th and 79th Shanghai-Wuxi and Shanghai-Suzhou second and third-class commuter train services on the Shanghai-Nanjing line from today.

[Report from the East China News Agency] The coal shortage problem at the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau has become the most serious stage. All coal reserves are only enough for three days, that is, until the 12th. If there is no other source after the 12th, all passenger and freight services on both railways will be completely suspended. According to the railway bureau, the monthly coal consumption for train operation was previously difficult to purchase due to tight finances. Fortunately, the Central Bank, the Four-Mine Joint Venture, and the Anthracite Coal Regulation Committee and other organizations assisted as much as possible to maintain it until now. However, coal prices have soared this month, and the railway bureau's total income is no longer sufficient to purchase coal. Therefore, if there is no thorough solution in the future, the operation of the two railways will be in question.

Attendees included Jiang Haoran, Wang Zhuyi, Zhu Fujiu, Lu Shun, Li Wenjie, Wang Naibao, and He Yuanming, representatives of the City Council Public Utilities Subcommittee; Zhao Zengjue and Zhang Renfu, Director and Deputy Director of the Public Utilities Bureau; and representatives of various companies, including Ferguson of Shanghai Electric Power Company, Loticais of French Electric Power Company, Lunhanstuo of French Tram Company, Simpson of Shanghai Gas Company, Locke of Water Company, and Pyro of British Electric Company. Chairman Jiang Haoran first reported that the City Council had already resolved to abolish the Guan Yuan calculation and explained the purpose of today's meeting, saying that each company could express their difficulties as much as possible. Then, the representatives of various companies stood up one after another to state their opinions. To summarize, their opinions were completely consistent, mostly expressing that they did not insist on the Guan Yuan calculation but believed that it was a more thorough method. They believe that subsidies or loans from the central government only increase procedures and that the result is still shared by the people. They also lamented the hardships, expressing that under the accelerated devaluation of the currency, the company's economy can no longer be maintained without reasonable adjustments. The new adjustment system was overturned by the City Council, and the adjustment based on the cost of living index has not yet been realized. During this transition period, the citizens are all adopting a wait-and-see attitude and delaying payment, and the public utility companies will collapse immediately. The representative of the U.S. Telephone Company even shouted, "My God, you can only run this company for me."

At that time, Director Zhao was participating in the meeting to review and determine the base numbers. Because the point of advance payment by users had been raised and rejected by the Public Utilities Subcommittee, it was not submitted for discussion yesterday.

### Municipal Government Orders Each Company to Submit Income and Expenditure Ledger

After the valuation of public utilities in Guan Yuan, the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Council both believed that it would hinder the promotion of the new economic policy and respectively requested the Municipal Government to revoke it and propose other methods. The Municipal Government has now ordered the Public Utilities Bureau to order each company to compile a ledger of all income and expenditure since "August 19" and submit it to the Public Utilities Bureau by 10:00 AM today (the 10th) for review and re-determination of valuation standards.

### Financial Management Bureau Statement: Guan Yuan Is Not Currency

[Report from our newspaper] Regarding the issue of public utilities being priced according to "Guan Yuan," the local financial management authorities made the following statement yesterday: In the recently promulgated financial and financial reform plan, the "Guan Yuan" item is only a unit of calculation for customs to collect import taxes and is not a currency that can circulate in the market. If general merchandise prices or labor service calculations are based on "Guan Yuan" as a standard, it is inconsistent with the original intent of the above-mentioned financial reform plan. The fact that public utilities use "Guan Yuan" as the pricing standard has been stopped by the Municipal Government, it is said.

### Changwei District Refugee Students Arrive in Shanghai from Qingdao to Transfer to Hunan; Lack of Travel Expenses and Difficult Living Conditions; Social Affairs Bureau Temporarily Grants Porridge for Four Days

[Our Newspaper News] More than two hundred middle school students, teachers, and family members from the Changwei District of Shandong Province fled to Qingdao around March last year. They spent half a year in Qingdao, struggling with difficult living conditions. Due to the limited number of publicly funded student places in Qingdao schools, they were unable to enroll. On the afternoon of the sixth of this month, they arrived in Shanghai on the Beiming Liner at 4:00 PM and temporarily resided in the Shandong Native Place Association on Zizhong Road. They slept on bedding in the classrooms of the Qilu Elementary and Middle School at night and wandered outside during the day when classes were in session. They originally planned to transfer to the Shandong Provincial United Middle School in Hengshan, Hunan, but their travel and living expenses were exhausted. The Shandong Provincial Government Office in Shanghai lacked funds and was unable to help. The person in charge of the Ministry of Education in Shanghai could not be found. After two days of efforts, there were no results. Yesterday morning, 175 refugee students went to the Social Affairs and Education Bureaus to petition. According to the Social Affairs Bureau, they could be sent to a shelter to solve their living problems, but the students felt that they were only staying in Shanghai for a few days and still wanted to go to Hunan to study, so they were unwilling to enter the shelter. The Social Affairs Bureau then decided to provide porridge for four days, until the 13th, two meals a day, and asked the student representatives to sign a pledge. In this way, their living expenses for a few days can be temporarily resolved, but the travel expenses to Hunan are still not secured. If they cannot leave by the 13th, the porridge will stop, and their lives will once again be in dire straits. Therefore, they especially appeal to various charitable organizations and philanthropists in this city for relief, so that they can enroll in school as soon as possible.

### The Far East Economic Fortress: HSBC Bank's Business Center Shifts from China to East Asia; New Transformation of British Merchants in the Current Situation

— Our Newspaper Reporter Zijing

[Our Newspaper Hong Kong Sixth Dispatch] The dynamics of Hong Kong merchants "doing business for business's sake" have been reported in the previous dispatch, but most of those words refer to Chinese merchants. What is the attitude of foreign merchants, especially British merchants? I believe that the general public in the country is also paying attention to it. The annual report of HSBC Bank, the largest British economic fortress in the Far East, was published yesterday. The words in this report can paint a picture of the current face of British merchants for us.

"Both sides of the conflict in China are determined to industrialize China in the shortest possible time as a means to alleviate the suffering of farmers. The necessary condition for this trend is to improve transportation, especially railways and inland river navigation systems. If the realization of this improvement is not to be prolonged, then machine tools and overseas investment are indispensable. Therefore, we should not neglect our position in China."

This is a passage from the report by HSBC Bank Chairman and General Manager Morse. He has peered through a country "that is falling into civil war, with a lax administrative system, a financial organization dominated by the military, and forced to abandon its attempts to maintain a balance of income and expenditure, relying on inflationary finances to maintain its daily needs," and seen a beautiful vista. He announced to British merchants, "In my humble opinion, all merchants engaged in foreign trade in China must prepare to deal with a completely new situation in the coming years, without any precedent, and adapt their ideas and actions to that new environment." Morse also affirmed that China must import consumer goods and machinery from foreign countries and export goods in exchange for imports. In other words, no matter what state China changes to, China must trade with foreign countries, and British merchants should tighten their grip on the Chinese market.

Don't just look at the distant scenery. Based on the fact that HSBC Bank issued an increase of more than HK$112 million in the past year and obtained a net profit of HK$16,792,000, with a dividend of £5 per share, British merchants will not easily give up the Chinese market that has been operating for more than a century. HSBC Bank is also the highest representative of British merchants in China.

However, Morse, looking at the overall situation in the Far East, had to admit that under the circumstances of inflation, the numbers are deceiving. Political disputes, foreign exchange controls, and other business restrictions have caused great resistance for British merchants. He pointed out a very important fact: HSBC Bank's business center has gradually shifted from China to Southeast Asia, and the importance of HSBC Bank's Singapore branch is now increasing day by day. While urging British merchants "not to neglect our position in China," Morse announced that the center of the largest British economic fortress in the Far East has been moved away from China. This change is worth noting.

Why should HSBC Bank's business center withdraw from China? Morse did not specify. He only lightly stated: "The outlook for the situation is unpredictable. Even looking at the world as a whole, the current unstable situation is more severe than any period in our memory. I feel that the future of China greatly depends on the changes in the world situation, especially the relationship between the Soviet Union and Western countries."

We cannot help but marvel at the British foresight on this point, but according to the above, we cannot interpret this new change of HSBC Bank as a sign that British merchants are abandoning the Chinese market. Morse's report also listed the relationship between HSBC Bank and the development of Hong Kong in the past 20 years, which is also worth mentioning. He said: "Twenty years ago, Hong Kong had a population of only 800,000. Now it is almost 2 million. In those days, the Hong Kong government's annual revenue was about 23.5 million, but now it exceeds 150 million. In those days, HSBC Bank's balance sheet was 710 million, but now it is 2.665 billion. The banknotes issued in those days were less than 65 million, but at the end of December last year it was 728 million. Last year's current deposits exceeded 1 billion. From these figures, HSBC Bank and Hong Kong are inseparable. From the perspective of HSBC Bank, the position of Hong Kong in today's Chinese economy is also clear at a glance."

### A District Chief in Wuxi Beats Up the Township Office

Therefore, the clerk Chen Wenrong contacted them and told them that the township chief was out on official business and asked them to wait a while. The two soldiers left immediately. Less than half an hour later, District Chief Zhuansun Xingzu personally led several armed men to the office. Without asking why, he punched the clerk Chen violently.

### Before the Formal Establishment of the Gold and Silver Market, the National Bank Expands the Scope of Distribution, Entrusting Banks, Bureaus, Trust Departments, and Silver Shops to Sell on Behalf

[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday afternoon around 5:00 PM, in response to the fluctuations in the market price of gold and banknotes, Mr. Liu, the president of the Central Bank, invited all relevant parties to discuss future gold and silver policies. As a result, the plan was not yet in a mature stage, and the news that was scheduled to be released after the meeting was temporarily suspended. Subsequently, Lin Chong, the director of the business bureau of the bank, told reporters that regarding the sale of gold, before the formal establishment of the open gold and silver market, the National Bank is considering expanding the scope of distribution to allow more institutions to sell gold on behalf of the National Bank. Entrusting silver shops is just a beginning. Regarding the disconnection between the National Bank's distribution price and the actual market price yesterday (i.e., the 9th), the National Bank will pay attention to it, and starting today (the 10th), it will take into account the actual situation and set a reasonable distribution price accordingly.

According to reliable sources, the National Bank will also entrust the trust departments of various national banks and bureaus to handle the sale of gold at the same time, in order to achieve universal supply.

Gold Prices Continue to Rise; Silver Shops are Crowded

[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday, the gold market continued to rise sharply due to the influence of the war and the easing of credit. When the gold market approached the 300,000 mark, the listed price of gold jewelry in the city's silver shops still stood at 267,000 yuan per tael. Affected by this, all silver shops in the city were crowded yesterday morning, and they were overwhelmed. However, due to limited funds, silver shops had limited purchases from the National Bank, so most of the sales at the door were limited to one or two mace of thread rings. Those exceeding this number were mostly politely rejected by the tellers. Some silver shops on Nanjing Road announced that they were sold out before 11:00 AM. In the afternoon, most of them posted signs to stop sales. At this time, the market price of gold had already soared past 300,000. Wu Pengnian, the chairman of the industry association, and others felt that the silver shops were in a difficult situation in this wave of gold price fluctuations and could not maintain normal business. They went to visit Lin Chongyong, the director of the business bureau of the National Bank, at noon to express their difficulties in person.

To Suppress Gold Price Fluctuations, Silver Shops are Allowed to Sell on Behalf

The National Bank authorities decided to ask the Gold Management Bureau to allow the city's silver shops to accept the National Bank's entrustment to sell gold bars on behalf, in addition to the original business of gold jewelry, starting from today. The selling price is the National Bank's distribution price plus a 20% handling fee. In addition, they do not bear security donations, business tax, and other expenses. Therefore, the National Bank's distribution price yesterday was 250,000 yuan per tael, and the retail price of bars in various silver shops in the afternoon was 255,000 yuan per tael. The National Bank decided to entrust various silver shops to sell bars at the door at around 1:00 PM yesterday. Although the application for distribution and purchase from various silver shops was unlimited in name, the silver shops were limited by funds and had weak absorption capacity. As a result, only more than 90 shops applied for purchase, with a purchase amount of only more than 3,100 taels. The National Bank allocated all of them according to the application. The payment for the gold purchased was limited to cash, bank drafts, or checks to be paid to the National Bank before 4:00 PM yesterday. In the future, the business of various silver shops will be divided into two departments: bars and gold jewelry. Before opening at 10:00 AM, each silver shop will first consult with the National Bank authorities to inquire about the market conditions of the day, and then operate according to the listed price, while preparing to apply to the National Bank for purchase procedures.

### Although the Net Deficit of National Banks and Bureaus is Huge, the Trend of Monetary Easing Has Not Weakened; Today's Settlement is Quite Large, and the Trend May Tighten

[Our Newspaper News] Yesterday's credit market initially showed a smooth overnight easing trend, but the daily interest rate still stood between five and six jiao. Later, due to the continued easing trend and the rumor that a huge amount of funds was allocated from a certain place and still remained in the market, the daily interest rate also gradually fell to four and a half to five and a half jiao. However, after 2:00 PM, the market suddenly heard that the money industry exchange had stopped accepting applications, and the credit market once turned bullish, but the daily interest rate still did not exceed six jiao. Later, it was confirmed that it was inaccurate, and the credit market turned to ease. Therefore, the fluctuations in the credit market for the whole day were limited, and the daily interest rate always hovered between five and six jiao. Although the net deficit of national banks and bureaus was 116.938 million yuan due to the sale of foreign exchange transfer certificates and the distribution of gold to the silver shops, the national treasury's expenditures were huge, and the credit market failed to tighten. The net deficit of other foreign merchants was 32.78 million yuan, the net surplus of large exchanges was 43.617 million yuan, and the net surplus of small exchanges was 106.101 million yuan. Today, there is a settlement of cotton yarn of about 1.1 billion yuan. If the National Bank sells gold or other materials in a timely manner and the national treasury has no special allocations, then today's credit market should turn tight and bullish.

### The Banking Association Sends a Circular to Members to Comply with the Check Clearing Time

[Our Newspaper News] The Banking Association believes that the sudden increase in the number of checks in circulation recently has had a significant impact on the clearing time. According to the original clearing time, the clearing start time is 2:00 PM, and it can be completed in about three quarters of an hour. The time limit for each bank to send checks is before 1:15 PM. The time limit for returning checks and making up the difference is before 8:00 PM. Recently, the delay has been too long. The time for sending checks often has to be extended to around 3:00 PM, so the clearing often has to be extended to 3:30 PM before it can start. The time for returning checks is often extended to around 10:00 PM in the evening. At this time of curfew, the check clearing house feels very inconvenient. Therefore, the Banking Association sent a circular to its members yesterday, urging them to comply with the check clearing time.

### After the Implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement, Smuggling in South China Has Improved

Mr. Lin Zaying, the representative of the Central Bank stationed in Hong Kong, recently came to Shanghai from Hong Kong to report on his work and request instructions on future work guidelines. In order to understand the recent financial trends in Hong Kong and the various situations after the implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong agreement, this reporter paid a special visit to Mr. Lin. According to him, since the official signing and implementation of the Sino-Hong Kong Agreement, the most effective result has been the substantial elimination of the rampant smuggling activities in various parts of South China. All banks and firms in Hong Kong are also able to handle the exchange of Gold Yuan Certificates in accordance with our country's regulations. The only problem currently being more complex is the revival of the Shanghai foreign exchange market. Regarding this matter, Mr. Lin believes that on the one hand, it requires the cooperation of Hong Kong, and on the other hand, it is also necessary to first seek stability in the domestic economic situation.

### The Market Sentiment Is Depressed, and Chinese Stocks Lack the Strength to Rise

Due to the depressed political situation, the Chinese stock market yesterday was strong at first but then weakened, showing a trend of lacking the strength to rise. Although the money supply has become looser, people's spirits are extremely low. Securities firms and major banking players are concentrating on scooping up gold, and even if they occasionally dabble in stocks, they immediately sell at high prices to realize profits. Retail investors are especially wary and dare not take action easily. Therefore, although off-exchange gold has risen, the stock market is becoming increasingly soft. Wing On Spinning opened at 5.535 yuan. Hearing that the Hong Kong exchange rate had narrowed, it was gradually pulled up, reaching a high of 5.63 yuan. Guangdong firms and No. 168 sold at high prices, and the market fell sharply again. At 11:30, the market within the exchange gradually became chaotic, and the bid-ask spread was as large as five cents. For a time, the market plummeted, with the lowest price at 5.533 yuan. Near the close, securities firms raised the price, and the market was slightly pulled up to close at 5.538 yuan. Mei Ya continued to decline, opening at 1.82 yuan, with a high of 1.87 yuan, a low of 1.67 yuan, and closing at 1.69 yuan.

Although off-exchange gold was reported to be rising sharply, breaking through the 300,000 yuan mark, the prices listed on the exchange were still sluggish, and trading did not improve much. The highest price was only 157,000 yuan, the lowest was 148,000 yuan, the highest in the afternoon was 180,000 yuan, and the closing price was 162,000 yuan, with a turnover of 248 taels, it is said.

Foreign Stocks Continue to Be Popular

Regarding the foreign stock market, due to the gradual easing of the money supply in the industry, the market continued to rise. Various firms were absorbing stocks, and retail investors were also scooping them up, so the market continued to be stable and strong. Ewo Cotton Mill traded at 10,500 yuan and 10,700 yuan, an increase of about 20% compared to the previous day. British American Tobacco continued its strong momentum, trading at 1,250 yuan and 1,350 yuan, an increase of 270 yuan compared to the previous day. Shanghai Brewery rose by 400 yuan, trading at 1,800 yuan and 1,900 yuan. Wheelock & Co. set a new high of 31,000 yuan and 33,000 yuan. Other stocks also rose by 10% to 20%.

### National Bank's Small Factory Loans to Temporarily End Starting on the 19th

Emergency Industrial Loans Will Continue to Be Processed

[Reported by this newspaper] The Small Factory Loan Review Committee of the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee held its fourth review meeting yesterday. Yan Yaoqiu and others attended, and approved 1,910 small factory loan cases.

Since mid-January of this year, the National Bank, in order to help small factories in this city during the Lunar New Year period, has been providing small factory loans. To date, two months have passed, and more than 8,000 small factories have been approved for loans, accounting for more than 80% of the factories in this city.

Loans of about 500 million yuan have been issued, allowing various industries to weather the difficulties. Recently, there have been very few applicants. Yesterday, the committee decided that the small factory loan program would temporarily end on March 19. If there is a need in the future, it will be held again.

[Another report] The Central Bank's Rediscount Committee's emergency industrial loans will continue to be processed, and order financing will be launched soon to provide production funds, it is said.

### Coarse and Fine Yarn Rise Sharply Together, Cotton Cloth Advances Towards High Peaks

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market surged, mainly because the applications for southbound transportation from various South China firms and colleagues have been largely approved, so the trading within the exchange was extremely active. In addition, financial and non-industry goods were all reported to be rising, and people's sentiments were unanimously geared towards higher prices. Holders were unwilling to sell, and buyers were vying to purchase, resulting in a situation of supply falling short of demand. As a result, the prices of various yarns rose by about 20% compared to the previous day.

42-count Blue Phoenix yarn broke through the 2 million yuan mark as soon as it opened in the morning, reaching a new high of 2.02 million yuan, and was finally pushed up to 2.18 million yuan, a sharp increase of 400,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon yarn soared by 240,000 yuan. 21-count Double Horse spot yarn jumped from 1.07 million yuan to a high of 1.17 million yuan, eventually settling at 1.15 million yuan, a dramatic jump of 243,000 yuan. Factory orders for the afternoon were at 1.145 million yuan. 20-count yarn, except for Double Bee and Ru Yi brands, were all traded outside the 1 million yuan mark. 16-count Guangming yarn also approached 1 million yuan, at 970,000 yuan. The prices of other yarns generally reached new highs.

The cloth market saw a resurgence of price increases, mainly because the money supply in the market was gradually easing, and rumors spread that large denomination 1,000 yuan banknotes would be issued again, leading to a sudden boost in people's spirits. Guangdong firms absorbed large quantities, and local firms were also unwilling to sit idly by, actively buying when prices were low, causing market prices to jump sharply.

Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 38,800 yuan, once falling to a low of 37,800 yuan. Near the close, upon hearing that cotton yarn prices had risen, buying interest suddenly surged, and the price broke through the 40,000 yuan mark, ending at 40,500 yuan, a sharp increase of 6,700 yuan. Trumpet Child fine cloth was at 37,800 yuan, a sharp increase of 5,200 yuan compared to the previous day. Four Gentlemen Yuan Bi Ji opened at 38,500 yuan, once falling to a low of 37,500 yuan midway, and then soared, eventually closing at 39,400 yuan, a surge of 6,500 yuan.

In addition, colored cloths and printed cloths were all advancing towards new highs. In the afternoon, due to the rise in red gold, off-exchange asking prices were seen rising again. It was heard that Dragon Head fine cloth was at 45,000 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Yuan Ji was at 44,500 yuan, but eventually fell slightly.

### China Textile Corporation Sells Yarn

The details of each yarn sale are as follows: (1) A total of 395 pieces of 20-count Grade B cotton yarn were offered, priced at 960,000 yuan. 47 buyers applied for 127 pieces, which were allocated as requested.

### A Stroll in the Market: Onlookers and Spectators

The rising tide has not yet fully taken root, and the intricate curtain has become quite complex. Interest rates and special offers fly together, backfiring and contributing to the situation.

Yesterday's market saw a sharp rise in prices, and the reasons are said to be very complex:

(1) The Hong Kong exchange rate shrank significantly. The night before last, it was 9.6 cents, but yesterday it opened at 8.8 cents. One Hong Kong dollar required 1,250 Gold Yuan, which, in the current circumstances, cannot but be astonishing.

(2) Premier Sun Yat-sen's resignation caused a great commotion in Guangzhou. It is said that the Hunan firms in Guangzhou sold 60 large boxes of large denomination banknotes to buy Hong Kong dollars, and then scooped up gold notes. In this city, the Guangdong firms were also very active, unanimously scooping up. This trend occurred before payday in the middle of the month, so although it cannot be said to be a true rising tide, the basic trend is indeed quite strong.

(3) Premier Sun Yat-sen announced in the Legislative Yuan that he was resigning, and also announced that the fiscal deficit for this year was more than 580 million US dollars. Some people say that this news is Premier Sun Yat-sen exposing the dirty laundry, but it is still the truth. With the truth revealed, how can people not be more enlightened?

(4) Every rumor, whether military or political, is beneficial, and this is also one of the key factors.

(5) The Central Bank's increase in the purchase price of foreign exchange transfer certificates proves that the Central Bank is really worried about the excess currency circulating outside, and cannot but think of ways to bring it back.

(6) Large denomination banknotes are flowing out in large quantities. For the sake of payday in the middle of the month, the new influx is one of the reasons for the rising tide, but it also meets the needs of the times.

(7) The more important real factor is interest rates. Although yesterday's increase was not small, the interest on funds dragged in on Monday was still insufficient. As the tide rises, so do the boats, this is an immutable truth.

Not to mention hidden interest, even if we calculate according to the listed interest rate of 50 yuan by money shops, if we use 10,000 yuan as capital to lend at the call loan rate, in five months, the principal and interest will become 1,192,448,000 yuan. This is such a terrible number. If call loans are like this, then commodity prices will naturally rise even more sharply.

Even so, the high interest rate policy has a hidden purpose for the authorities. Because when the rising tide comes, the authorities have no countermeasures, wouldn't that be embarrassing? With this strategy, they can beautify the past. That is, when the rising tide is fierce, they can sharply raise interest rates, temporarily diverting speculative funds. But even temporary effectiveness can show some ability, and can give some explanation to superiors and subordinates alike.

But there is a condition here: if the rising tide and interest rates rise gradually, then the authorities' plan can be realized. If the rising tide and interest rates rise at the same time, then adding fuel to the fire becomes superfluous.

### Affected by the Loose Money Supply, Rice Prices Jump Again, White Fine Rice Sells for as High as 30,000 Yuan

The rice market saw another sharp jump yesterday, mainly due to the loose money supply. Furthermore, with gold prices rising beforehand, people's sentiments were strong, and asking prices rose significantly. Various types of rice in the North City market rose by 3,000 yuan across the board. White fine rice sold for as high as 28,000 yuan, and special fine rice approached 30,000 yuan, selling for 29,500 yuan. In the South City market, white fine rice was at 27,000 yuan, an increase of 2,000 yuan. Early thin rice also increased by 2,000 yuan. Arrivals in the two markets totaled 7,548 piculs. In the afternoon, white fine rice was already selling for as high as 30,000 yuan in retail stores.

[Reported by this newspaper] The American vessel "Noman Lykes" arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying 1,800 bags of flour and more than 5,490 bales of cotton from the United States.

Edible Oil: Due to the loose money supply, there was a reactionary surge. Raw rapeseed oil opened at 103,000 yuan and eventually reached 110,000 yuan. Soybean oil closed at 115,000 yuan, and it was still difficult to buy. Prices rose by 17,000 to 19,000 yuan. Good barrel raw oil rose by 15,000 yuan, opening at 138,000 yuan.

Flour: Under the loose money supply, the market soared. "Battleship" brand rose sharply by 20%.

### Silk Prices Rose Rapidly in the Morning, but Weakened in the Afternoon

Yesterday's artificial silk market saw a sharp rise. The money supply in the market remained loose yesterday, continuing the trend of easing from the afternoon of the previous day. Hidden interest rates fell to 5.5 to 6 cents, and the money supply within the industry was very loose, triggering a buying spree.

120-count new raw silk opened at 1.35 million yuan. After opening, sales were slow due to more stock than the previous day, and the market showed a slight consolidation. Later, off-exchange gold rose rapidly, and cotton yarn prices were especially strong, boosting people's spirits greatly. Traders continued to push up prices, and buying interest in the market was strong. Asking prices soared, hovering around 1.4 million yuan, and the base was very firm. Towards the close, it was heard that gold had fallen and then risen again, and the supply of funds remained continuous. Buying interest rose again, and the market continued to rise, reaching a high of 1.48 million yuan. Finally, it was heard that the authorities would start selling materials in large quantities from today, and the money supply might tighten, causing people's sentiments to soften slightly and the rising momentum to weaken slightly, eventually closing at 1.47 million yuan. In the afternoon, the money supply was slightly tight, hidden interest rates rose, and off-exchange gold opened high and closed low. The market did not improve, and asking prices fell by 50,000 to 60,000 yuan.

Yesterday's raw silk market saw a quiet rise in foreign exchange certificates again. Off-exchange gold advanced rapidly, and the loose supply of funds and the bullish sentiment among people boosted the market. High-grade alternate reels were sold at a high price of 2 million yuan in the morning. After opening, various firms were mostly watching, and people's sentiments were flat, leading to a slightly softer trend. Later, foreign exchange certificates opened high and closed low, and the market entered a consolidation phase. Near noon, off-exchange gold fell and then rose again, and the potential of speculative funds remained strong. Local firms started scooping up first, and asking prices rose by 100,000 yuan. After reaching a high, various goods outside the industry rose sharply in unison, and there were many long orders within the industry. With supply and demand easing, the market saw another rise, reaching a high of 1.18 million yuan near noon. D-grade, 78 evenness, was at 2.2 million yuan, a significant increase. In the afternoon, multi-head interest rates on off-exchange gold were suppressed again, and the money supply tightened. Hidden interest rates in the market were at 75 yuan with demand. Many retail investors continued to sell, and the market turned into a weak consolidation phase. After weakening, buying interest became sluggish, and people's sentiments were extremely soft, with asking prices falling by 150,000 yuan, once falling to a low of 2.03 million to 2.05 million yuan.

Yesterday's silk market continued the loose money supply trend from the previous day, and saw an increase as soon as it opened. Later, gold prices soared, and people's sentiments turned bullish, all leading to strong buying interest. The afternoon close saw a general rise. Mei Ya damask was initially asked for at 880,000 yuan. After opening, buying interest was very strong, once reaching a high of 930,000 to 940,000 yuan. Later, Chinese stocks weakened, and gold turned lower after reaching a high. Speculative funds within the industry flowed out, and the intention to sell in the market instantly intensified, and the market once fell back to the edge of the 890,000 yuan mark. After a short while, traders actively bought on dips, and it was also heard that cotton yarn prices were soaring, and gold eventually rebounded, and the market regained its quiet strength, eventually closing at 920,000 yuan in the afternoon.

### Foreign Currency Carried by Outbound Travelers Is Limited to US$500

For those traveling to Hong Kong and Macau, the total value should not exceed US$100. Any excess will be confiscated according to law.

### Export Tea Soars

Export box teas such as Anhui green tea have been inherently stable and quiet since their stocks dwindled. Yesterday, the market was further boosted by rumors of a French economic delegation coming to Shanghai to purchase Chinese tea. In addition, financial and non-industry goods were all soaring, leading to increasingly high spirits among people. Holders' asking prices were like wild horses running without reins, rushing straight ahead. Therefore, although trading was lacking, the market sentiment rose sharply again. As for domestic tea, the stalemate in the digestion and absorption negotiations also led to extremely narrow transactions, and the rising tide spread along with it.

### Export Goods Applications for Foreign Exchange Settlement Decreased by About 40% Last Week

[Reported by this newspaper] The Export Control Commission announced yesterday that the amount of applications for foreign exchange settlement for export goods in the Shanghai port last week (February 27 to March 5) decreased by about 40% compared to the previous week.

Third was miscellaneous goods, accounting for US$215,397.93.

### Tung Oil Rises Sharply

The tung oil market saw continuous price increases yesterday, stemming from the latent strength of the previous day's increase not being sufficient. At the same time, it was stimulated by the soaring prices of gold, US dollars, and various goods outside the exchange, leading to extremely high spirits among people. Sellers' asking prices rose rapidly, largely keeping pace with the others. However, after a short while, it was suddenly heard that the Central Bank was selling large quantities of cotton yarn to tighten the money supply, and everyone's thoughts became slightly calmer, and the rising momentum suddenly stopped. But compared to the previous day, there was still a sharp rise.

### The British Navy's London Team Played a Wonderful Football Match, with a Crisp, Clean, and Straightforward Style. The London Team Won a Narrow Victory with a Score of 3-2.

[Reported by this newspaper] After tying with the Railway Team in previous battles, the British Navy's London football team took to the field for the second time yesterday, clashing with the local powerhouse Longtou. The British Navy fielded a new lineup, still maintaining its crisp, clean, and straightforward style. Longtou, on the other hand, added two generals to its defense and forward lines, with Gao Xiuqing in the front and Wu Qixiang in the back, participating as guest players, greatly enhancing its offensive and defensive strength. The two teams were evenly matched and played for 90 minutes, with Longtou winning a narrow victory of 3-2. Gao Xiuqing scored all three goals, stealing the show. It is a pity that such a wonderful football match was watched by only over a thousand people in the Yiyuan stands. The Football Committee plans to arrange two more matches for the British Navy on Friday and Saturday, with potential opponents being the combined team of Qingbai and Qunli Zhichao Jingwu. The lineups fielded by both sides yesterday were as follows:

Longtou Team

Gao Weichen

Zheng Bingyi Wu Qixiang

Wu Kaimin Wang Baoshan Shi Dafa

Wang Burong Jiang Kun Gao Xiuqing Chen Qin Zhang Jingen

British Navy

Zaidmeier

Taitley Feaston

Gravel Messers Hollert

Parnell Dielent Lenon Beatty Griffin

The match started at 4 o'clock. Longtou entered the field in full "East Star" uniforms. Referee He Chunhui blew the whistle to start the match. Both sides adopted a bold and straightforward style of play, which was exceptionally refreshing. The British team kicked off, but was immediately intercepted. The ball went back and forth in midfield. Gao Xiuqing advanced and took a shot near the goal, but missed. The British Navy's right winger Griffin was exceptionally active, dribbling and crossing the ball. Lenon headed the ball, but missed. Wang Baoshan took a long shot, and the enemy's goal was in danger. Dielent charged straight at the goal, but Beatty was one step too late, and failed to score in the empty goal. The British team's offensive was quite fierce. Messers took a free kick, and the momentum was fierce. Fortunately, Gao Weichen deflected it, saving it as a corner kick, which was extremely dangerous. Wu Qixiang ran all over the field, contributing to the defense. Under the leadership of Gao Xiuqing, Longtou's forwards connected with small passes, which was quite skillful and could utilize both wings, attacking from both left and right, and sending the ball to the British goal. It was a pity that the three center forwards often failed to connect with the ball, making it a pie in the sky, and good opportunities were lost one after another. After a stalemate of 20 minutes, Chen Qin got the ball and sent it into the center. Xiao Gao (Gao Xiuqing) caught up and charged fiercely, scoring in one fell swoop, opening the scoring. Longtou continued its efforts and launched frequent offensives, but all without result. Ten minutes later, the British army also came to attack the goal. Griffin penetrated deep on the right, hooking the ball from the baseline. Dielent headed the ball, and Gao Weichen jumped up to catch the ball, but failed to hold it and patted the ball to the ground. Unfortunately, it was already inside the white line, and it was judged as a winning goal for the British army. The first half ended with each side drawing one goal.

After resting and fighting again, there was no development within ten minutes, and the ball situation appeared dull. Suddenly, Chen Dong took a long shot and sent it in front of the goal. The British army's defender rushed out too far and was unable to save it. Gao Xiuqing raised his foot and the ball fell, responding and entering the net. Longtou took the lead at two to one. The British army counterattacked, and Wu Qixiang was seen clearing the ball. Ten minutes later, Zhang Quangen invaded from the right, and Taitley hurriedly stopped him, passing the ball back to the goalkeeper. Unexpectedly, Gao Xiuqing rushed up from the side and scored again. Longtou had victory in hand at two to one. The British army launched a long-range attack, lacking control and coordination, and everyone was mentally and physically exhausted. Five minutes later, the British army finally headed the ball in from the left wing Parnell in the chaos, winning back a goal. Finally, after the British army took a corner kick, the silver whistle sounded for a long time, announcing the end of the match. Daxia Wanliding will have a rematch today.

### Yingguang Wins the Right to the Final of the Democracy Cup Intermediate Group

Daxia Wanliding will have a rematch today

Yingguang Football Team defeated Shanghai Police 1-0 at the South City Stadium yesterday, winning the right to the final of the Democracy Cup Intermediate Group. In this match, only five minutes after the start, Yingguang Tao Tingfu took a free kick 30 steps to the right front of the Shanghai Police goal. Yu Qiaoxing caught the ball squarely and headed it into the net. After that, there was no win or loss. The Shanghai Police were unfortunately eliminated with this lonely goal.

Another rematch in the Intermediate Group of the Democracy Cup, Daxia vs. Wanli, will be held at 4 pm today. Referee Chen Fubao, linesmen Zang Wenbin Fang Rongfu. Daxia has strong strength and is the most popular to win the championship, but most of the Wanli players are old members of the Xin Xianlin team, the champion of the South City League. Having been on the battlefield for a long time, they may be able to make the student army bow their heads. The lineups of both sides are as follows:

Wanli

Zhu Xinzhang

Long Guoliang Yu Yongxing

Zhu Wenbao Xu Deshun Zhang Wenlong

### Sports World Tonight's Three Basketball Matches in Group A: Huili Re-Engages Encas; Foreign Soldiers and Generals of Macklin First Meet Pei Fei'er

In the fourth basketball league, there will be three Group A matches today. Besides the first match between Pei'er and Tielian in Group C of Group A2, the remaining two matches are the second-round battles of Group A1. Macklin versus Pei Fei'er is their first encounter. The first-round match was postponed due to circumstances and has not yet been rescheduled. The other match is Huili re-engaging Encas. Ticket prices remain the same, with three types: 300, 600, and 900. The order and referee list are as follows:

Pei'er -- Tielian (Group C of Group A2) 5:30 PM Referees: Di Xianzhang, Wang Yiqiao

Macklin -- Pei Fei'er (Group A1) 6:30 PM Referees: Tao Bolinji, Liu Hesheng

Encas -- Huili (Group A1) 7:30 PM Referees: Chen Baolin, Huang Cunrui

In the opening match, Pei'er will compete against Tielian. The former has a considerable history in the local basketball scene. Besides the Hu family's generals, players like Yu Erjia and Shen Beizhang have also been in the ranks for a long time. However, due to a lack of practice, their recent performance has not been very good. In the current season, they have won against Pang Team twice but lost to Ping Ping. Tielian is composed of railway employees. They have abundant stamina and strong fighting spirit. When the two teams meet, there will definitely be a fierce battle.

Macklin and Pei Fei'er are two foreign armies having their first encounter. The players of Macklin are all burly and strong, with proficient offensive and defensive methods. In the first round, due to unfamiliarity with the venue, they often suffered defeats, which was unfortunate. In terms of skills, their potential lies in tonight's performance, and they should make further progress. As for Pei Fei'er, they repeatedly lost in the first round. However, in the first battle of the second round, they surprisingly defeated the league leader Hualian by a narrow margin of 44 to 43, becoming a dark horse. When the two foreign armies compete, it is unknown who will win.

The final match is Huili re-engaging Encas. In their first encounter, Huili defeated Encas with a score of 47 to 38. Tian, Cao, and Wang of Huili are all good players, brave and good at fighting. With the assistance of Chen Zhengmiao, Ye Yunshan, and others, the team's strength has become more complete. However, Encas is the oldest and strongest Western team in Shanghai. Players such as Queli Botuo, Ouchai Liao, etc., are cunning and abnormal. Ge Pengqigu Fu and Tao Bolinji are accurate in shooting, and the newcomer Bo Tou's skills are even more outstanding. Although Bei Geni is unable to play due to leaving Shanghai, their strength should not be underestimated. Tonight, when enemies meet on a narrow road, they intend to avenge their past grievances. Huili should be careful. The list of six teams is as follows:

(Pei'er) Yu Erjia, Ma Zhenglun, Hu Huichong, Shen Beizhang, Hu Huikai, Wu Liangjun, Hu Huizhao, Hu Huifan, Wu Shijian, Wang Weigong.

(Tielian) Dong Junyang, Hu Tongyi, Zhu Rugui, Zhao Zhengzhi, Wang Kunsheng, Zhang Minquan, Fan Yueping, Sun Lipei, Zhang Qichang.

(Macklin) Lis, O'Enge, Gefens, Laimushan, Cai Laote, Pengkesi Dong, Hua Erfu, Ensi Weitai, Qiaokesheng, O'Enasi, Gudi, Bola Shou.

### Philippine International 400-meter Swimming Competition: Fatty Nan Ranks Fourth; Hong Kong and Philippine Overseas Chinese Plan to Hold Inter-City Team Competitions

[Hong Kong Shipping News] Chen Zhennan, who represented Hong Kong alone in the international swimming competition organized by the Philippine Athletic Association, made his second appearance at the Rizal Swimming Pool at 8 PM on the 6th, competing in the 400-meter freestyle.

In the 1,500-meter long-distance swimming competition on the first night, due to the gathering of famous players from all over the world, Fatty Nan fought hard but could only win fifth place. Although he was not too far behind, he only scored two points. However, judging from Chen Zhennan's strength, he has plenty of stamina but lacks speed. Therefore, people generally believe that Fatty Nan is more confident in the 1,500-meter long-distance race than in the 400-meter middle-distance race, which has shaken their hopes for him.

However, before Chen Zhennan's departure, at the farewell banquet in Liu Shiwen's private residence, Chen's coaches, the Huang Shaochi brothers, had already given him a secret plan, which was: When competing in the Philippines, he must be ahead of the crowd and strive to lead, especially in the shorter 400-meter race, to avoid repeating the mistake of last year's Hong Kong-Philippine inter-city competition, where he was "robbed" of too many leads, and although he was able to catch up hard afterwards, he still fell behind. Therefore, in the 400-meter final in the Rizal Memorial Swimming Pool last night, when the gun sounded, Chen Zhennan fought to get ahead. Among the nine athletes competing, Chen was between third and fourth place, which was slightly better than his championship in the 880-yard inter-city swimming competition that year.

The race involved swimming eight laps, and there was intense competition throughout. Zhennan's arms were strong in paddling water, but his feet were slightly heavy, which was a slight flaw. After 300 meters, he was overtaken by Mabasi and another Philippine World Games athlete, but Chen was still able to beat three or four other athletes by a body length and surpass the last swimmer by a distance of ten li. In the last lap, Chen was in fourth place until the end. The first place was a Philippine World Games athlete, Mabasi was second, and Chen was fourth, which was a step forward compared to his performance in the 1,500-meter race on the first night.

[Another News] Fatty Chen Zhennan has returned to Hong Kong on the 8th. According to him, the trip to the Philippines was due to a long period of lack of practice and the hot weather there. The swimming pool was also a freshwater pool with little buoyancy, which prevented him from reaching the expected level. He felt deeply sorry for not living up to expectations. According to reports, Chen participated in the 1,500-meter race and ranked fifth, with a score of around 23 minutes. The first, second, third, and fourth places were all Filipinos, and the first place's score was 21 minutes and 35.7 seconds. Chen was fourth in the 400-meter race, with a score of about 5 minutes and 30 to 40 seconds (Chen's highest record for this event is 5 minutes and 16 seconds). The first place's score for this event was 5 minutes and 18 seconds.

Chen also told reporters that during his trip to the Philippines, the Hong Kong Chinese swimming community entrusted him to contact the Philippine Overseas Chinese to hold a Hong Kong-Philippine Overseas Chinese inter-city swimming competition. He received the agreement of the Philippine Overseas Chinese. If it comes true, there may be a Hong Kong-Philippine Overseas Chinese swimming competition in Hong Kong in July or August.

### Olympic Committee: Germany Invited to Participate

[Reuters, Frankfurt, August 8] According to the Frankfurt News, German representatives have received invitations to participate in the International Olympic Committee's plenary session to be held in Rome next month. The invitation was sent to Duke Magenburg, who has been a member of the International Olympic Committee for a long time and also attended the London Conference last year. (Note: This move by the International Olympic Committee is tantamount to inviting Germany to participate in the next World Games.)

### Walcott Will Participate: Confident of Winning the Boxing Championship

[Agence France-Presse, Philadelphia, August 8] American boxer Walcott announced today, when he first met with reporters after Joe Louis gave up his world heavyweight boxing title, "I will be the next world heavyweight boxing champion, and I am very confident." According to reports, Walcott will compete with Charlie this summer for the honor of the world boxing championship. He is 34 years old this year. He has been defeated by Joe Louis twice in the fight for this honor. This summer's competition will be his third appearance.

### Thinking of Silver Dollars

— Suo Bei

If the circulation of silver dollars began in the Guangxu era, then it has been circulating in China for at least sixty or seventy years. Unexpectedly, after sixty or seventy years, after repeated reforms of the monetary system, it is still relying on silver dollars again. This shows that in China, changes and reforms are nothing more than returning to the original point.

The issuance of legal tender in the 24th year [of the Republic] and the emergence of "gold certificates" in the 37th year were both against silver dollars, but in the end, they were all defeated by silver dollars.

During the major reform of "August 19th," the government used "gold-containing" certificates to widely collect silver dollars, while at the same time imposing severe penalties to prohibit their circulation or possession. This time, it was indeed the end of silver dollars.

However, before long, silver dollars made a comeback. The elders and various "bosses" in the folk felt cordial when they reunited after a long separation, and people were all fortunate that the "silver dollar injustice" had been redressed. Precisely because of this, it aroused the "silver dollar craze" that swept the country. Those involved in the vortex included workers, farmers, soldiers, students, public and church staff, and so on.

These stories depict the tragedy of China's real economy and also illustrate a truth: In China, things that are deeply rooted are not easily eradicated at once.

Silver dollar transactions are unique: both secretive and grand. Everyone knows the inside story, so there is no need to elaborate.

Silver dollars are sometimes banned and sometimes released. The government once exchanged them in a continuous stream through deposit exchanges, but then said that buying and selling were not allowed, intending to make people eat silver dollars like pancakes. While saying that buying and selling are strictly prohibited, it allows them to come in and out.

What is the law in China? It is not difficult to understand from silver dollars.

Now, silver dollar trading is 100% legal under the "protection" of new financial cases.

Therefore, the silver bulls on Henan Road no longer take Ningbo Road as the boundary, but step south, and the territory expands to Nanjing Road. The rhythm of "Ke Dang" is faster and stronger than in the past, and the cries of "big and small heads buying and selling" are louder and more powerful than before.

Preview: Soon, this music can be played publicly on buses, trams, and public entertainment venues.

Perhaps because the traffic on Henan Road is too unruly, the authorities have heard that they are preparing to establish a silver dollar market. If so, in the future, speculation will no longer be limited to large gold and currency dealers, and small citizens can also go to the silver market to buy and sell short.

In the new plan, silver dollars can be said to be incorrect in name and unreasonable in wording: It is estimated as the standard for calculating salaries, and it is stipulated that gold yuan certificates are the only standard currency. It is preparing to manufacture 600,000 silver dollars a day, but it does not allow the market to price in silver dollars. It allows silver dollars to circulate, claiming financial reform and stabilizing prices, and at the same time, four major banknotes are issued together.

I think: The task of the new plan is only to turn the semi-public silver dollar speculative trading into public and legal; to protect the "occupation" of scalpers. In a turbulent society, there is an additional burden of raising parasitic elements.

There are indeed many strange things this year, but nothing is more interesting than the authorities' handling of silver dollars.

### Rogue · Ah Q · and Face

— Si Yi

For several years, the six words "rogue, Ah Q, face" that are most likely to cause disputes between me and my wife are unavoidable in life, and we often argue about it until we are red in the face.

In her opinion, and as far as possible to implement; "A person living in the world must have face. Although face is hypocritical and worthless, we must try our best to seize it, because if a person does not care about face, that is a typical rogue."

Until now, because I understand her good intentions of "face", I pay part of the income in exchange for sweat and blood for "unnecessary" extra expenses. For example, the tap water used in my current residence is pumped from an artesian well by an electric motor. The monthly electricity bill is calculated for each residential building in the alley, and each residential building is calculated by household registration. Therefore, I, a family of four, bear the same number as a family of more than ten.

Of course, I am always indignant. Many times, I proposed to change this payment method, but my wife habitually came up with a simple logic.

She said: "If you propose to change, you originally want to be fair, but people will say that you can't afford to pay. Then they will call you a rogue. A person with face will never be willing to be a rogue. You just treat this unequal expenditure as relief for some charity."

I said, "In the end, you revealed the prototype of Ah Q. People like us need others to help us before we can help others?"

So, we argued like this again. She kept talking about "for the sake of face", but I was dumbfounded.

Ah Q spent a lot of effort for "face" during his lifetime. However, after the coffin was closed, Ah Q's face not only did not "shine through the ages", but ended up in a "rogue" situation. What I feel most puzzled about is that in addition to my wife, there are so many heroes and heroes in the country who "are afraid of being rogues" and "fight for face", following Ah Q's legacy and "continuing to work hard" all day long. This allows truly unreasonable rogues to be blatant and act as if nothing happened in broad daylight.

### Talking about Money in Ancient and Modern Times

— Xu Dasan

Light currency and heavy goods have been the case in ancient and modern times. Today, shops sell goods, some of which are priced in silver dollars, but if you pay with silver dollars, you still need to calculate it according to the gold yuan certificate. It is better to use gold yuan certificates because it is easier to calculate. The history of using banknotes in our country began with the "flying money" of the Tang Dynasty. In fact, "flying money" still has the nature of today's drafts. The "Jiaozi" and "Huizi" of the Song Dynasty, and the "Jiaochao" of the Jin Dynasty, were the real banknotes. The Yuan Dynasty always used banknotes. When Zhu Ming rose up, he cast copper coins in Nanjing for use in the world. At that time, officials asked the people to produce copper, and the people destroyed utensils and handed them over to the government, which was quite painful. However, merchants were accustomed to using banknotes, and they felt that it was inconvenient to use money, so they gave Ming Taizu an opportunity. Dameng banknotes were circulated throughout the world, and those who forged them were beheaded, and those who reported them were rewarded with twenty-five taels of silver, and the property of the criminals was still given. Soldiers stationed abroad were paid monthly salt with banknotes, and each salt field was given banknotes for labor costs. Public officials' salary rice was also given banknotes, and two thousand five hundred texts of banknotes were equivalent to one stone of rice. In fact, in the Jiangnan area, people valued money over banknotes, and one string (one thousand texts) of banknotes could only be exchanged for one hundred and sixty texts of copper coins. By the end of the Hongwu period, Dameng Bao banknotes had expanded by more than six times.

After Ming Chengdi ascended the throne, he further reiterated the prohibition of using gold and silver in transactions, and offenders would be sent to the army. At that time, Zhang Yu, a censor of the Shaanxi Dusi, was exiled for exchanging official banknotes. A commoner in Jiangxia died his father and used silver to build a funeral tool, and he would also be sent to the army according to the regulations. It was considered that he was forced to treat the funeral, not breaking the law, and was exempted by Chengzu. It can be seen that a few days ago, the gold and silver scalpers were caught and only detained for a few days, which was not serious.

The Ming Dynasty issued too many banknotes, and also embarked on the road of malignant inflation. In the early years of Shide, one stone of rice used fifty strings of banknotes, which had risen twenty times compared with the salary rice discount during the Hongwu period. At that time, the Ming Dynasty also tried to get the banknotes back into circulation, such as "collecting banknotes for salt according to the population" and "collecting banknotes for tax grain courses and fines". And it also sold goods, such as "ordering salt officials to pay old banknotes to pay for salt, issuing firewood accumulated in the Nanjing pumping field, bamboo and wood in the Longjiang Diju Division, and the military and civilians of Luzhi, to collect their banknotes". By the time of Yingzong and Xianzong, there were more banknotes, and one string of banknotes could not be worth one text. The people traded and simply calculated in rice, wheat, silver, and money. Yingzong opened the ban on the use of silver. However, the official salary was still paid with banknotes, which was really a dead end for civil servants. During the Xianzong period, it had to be ordered that internal and external taxes, money, and banknotes should be collected, and official salaries and military salaries should also be paid with money and banknotes. Although one string of banknotes was not worth one text at that time, the people who were levied on banknotes had to pay two cents and five li of silver for each string, which shows the high official price. It can be seen that if too many banknotes are issued, the issuer will also have to refuse to use them. Today, measures such as the customs, public utilities, and enterprises using customs yuan and the distribution of silver dollars for civil service salaries are all copied from old methods, which have existed since ancient times, and are not surprising.

### "Stability" and "Fairness"

— Lei Ting

In order to seek "stability" in the prices of public utilities and to seek "fairness" in the burden on citizens, the municipal government has decided on a "calculation unit for public utilities" and has already put it into practice.

In this way, the prices of public utilities are really "stable", because from now on, public utilities will no longer have the trouble of requesting price adjustments, the authorities will not have the trouble of bargaining, and public utilities will no longer have the suspicion of leading price increases. It is really smart and extremely smart to achieve three goals at once. However, is the burden on citizens really fair?

From the perspective of burden alone, it can be said to be both fair and reasonable. Because how much water and electricity you consume, and how much distance you travel by bus and tram, anyone should pay the same price. (Although those wearing uniforms or wearing badges still do not care about this, but these are a small number of special citizens, who should be exceptions.) And this price is extremely "fair", the amount of which depends on the ups and downs of the customs yuan, and the ups and downs of the customs yuan depend on foreign exchange, and so on.

But after thinking about it, it is a little "unfair" and "unreasonable". Because the so-called burden, simply put, is expenditure, and expenditure is compared with income. We don't have to be as careful as the Jews, but at the very least we have to ensure that income can meet expenditure, even if it is a little difficult. If it is always in deficit, it is difficult to say.

However, what is the income of our general citizens? Factories and shops issue salaries based on the index (the index is based on gold yuan certificates, not customs yuan), and public officials issue salaries at 75 times, but their current expenses have to be calculated according to the so-called "fair" "calculation unit for public utilities". This calculation really calculates them to the point of exhaustion.

Of course, in this time of "national crisis", the people have the obligation to endure a little hardship. But it must also be endured willingly and it must also be eaten. If only the general powerless and weak citizens suffer, and high officials, large entrepreneurs, and large capitalists do not participate, how can that be masked by superficial "fairness"!

Or someone may say: Has this "calculation unit for public utilities", which has been carefully studied by the authorities, "failed" again? The answer is: No. However, the authorities have only done half of this plan. Because they put all their energy on "stability" and unconsciously neglected "fairness". And this kind of big plan that is only half done is often the most painful thing for small citizens. That's all!

### Guangzhou Dog Fighting

— Wen

Hong Kong newspapers reported that a "Famous Dog Competition Exhibition" was held in Guangzhou on the 6th of this month, which was organized by the Guangzhou National Sports Association. More than 100 fierce dogs participated, and there were dog fighting arenas and performance arenas in the venue. Among them, there was a dog raised by a Liang from Huangzhuqi Township, which was very brave and defeated more than 60 fierce dogs without any fear.

A couplet was hung at the entrance of the dog fighting arena. The text reads:

Do not discuss merits with Xiao He, do not teach Han Xin to call for help, relying on a brand new mind, ashamed to follow high-ranking officials who flatter superiors, learning to bark;

Do not flatter Xia Jie to attack Yao, do not attach to Jin Ling to fight with shields, relying on sharp claws and teeth, strive to face the current strong enemy, and strive to become famous.

Although the couplet is not good, it is quite thought-provoking.

### Western Humor

— Su Zhai

In a crowded tram, a sailor was sitting on the lap of another sailor.

A beautiful woman came in.

The sailor pushed his friend away and said loudly, "A female passenger is here, hurry up and let her in."

Husband: "Now that we are married, I swear that I will no longer know a woman."

Wife: "Wait a minute, I am going to introduce one to you now, and that is your mother-in-law."

The father warned his son not to go to see the leg show.

"Why?" the son asked.

"Because you will see people you shouldn't see."

The son went to see it, and sure enough, he saw the person he shouldn't see,——his father.

A lady said:

"Women like to talk a lot, but we have only said half of what we know."

There was a woman in Chicago who said during her fifth divorce: "There are not few men, but there are too few good ones."
