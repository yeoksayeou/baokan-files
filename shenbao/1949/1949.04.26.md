Editorial

### Youth's Worries and Vigilance

Today, we are facing a great era unprecedented in history, with international situations changing rapidly and new and old thoughts clashing intensely. After the Second World War, we originally hoped that a long-term peace would be established internationally, but the shadow of war still looms over the minds of people all over the world. Looking back at our own country, the excitement of victory did not last long, and people once again suffered the pain of war. Young people are the most sensitive, and how can they not feel extremely depressed when they see the world in chaos, with the flames of war everywhere and poverty everywhere! This depression festers inside and manifests as dissatisfaction with reality, which is then expressed externally, thus creating serious phenomena of complex thoughts,激烈的actions, and social unrest.

The biggest worry of young people at present is the lack of a correct life goal and a consistent life ideal. Russell said: "The pain of life lies not in the lack of food and clothing, but in the wandering and rootlessness of thought." The current worry of young people is actually due to their wavering thoughts and lack of direction. Being in such a great era without a correct understanding of the essence of this great era and without being able to choose the path they should take, they will naturally feel worried.

Young people's dissatisfaction with reality certainly has objective social factors. I think it is good for young people to be able to express dissatisfaction with reality. At least they have reason, emotion, and enthusiasm. A young person who lives a drunken, dreamy, and complacent life only knows the enjoyment of material life and does not think about the problems of the country and society at all. It is a thoughtful person who can consider the future of individuals or the nation. Only thoughtful people have hope and ideals, and only then will they have feelings of "satisfaction" and "dissatisfaction". In fact, the hope of the nation and the country rests on these young people who feel worried.

The youth who were born in the 1950s have more worries in their hearts than at any time in the past, but their luck is also something that the youth of the past could not have dreamed of. Experience is education, and life is a mirror. Precisely because this great era is full of changes and wonders, we can gain a lot of experience. Present life is also the most powerful lesson. Only today can the great scenes of human struggle for survival unfold. If it is said that mankind progresses through learning, then today is an excellent opportunity to learn, and we can conclude that the progress of human culture in the future will be amazing. The period of hardship and difficulty we are facing today is the necessary process for entering a new and ideal society. For the sake of the future of mankind, young people should not shirk their responsibilities. The more difficult the times, the more they must step up their efforts and strengthen their courage to accept difficulties.

It is useless to simply express dissatisfaction with reality. We should analyze the various factors that cause dissatisfaction with an objective attitude and a high degree of reason. Young people are full of a sense of justice and enthusiasm, but sometimes emotions inevitably obscure reason, and they often judge things by intuition. They hope too much, which is merely a temporary impulse in feeling. For example, the original motive for wanting to reform society is very good, but reforming society cannot be accomplished overnight. The formation of various social ills has various causes, far and near, internal and external. To talk about transformation, one must first understand the crux of the problem, and proceed step by step according to a meticulous plan, definite steps, and appropriate methods. One must not act blindly, one must not be too hasty, and one must not expect too much. Our ideals are not afraid of being high, but our work must be down-to-earth. There is no shortcut to success in the world. Young people see the precariousness of the country and society today, and express deep feelings of sadness and indignation, wishing they could immediately reverse the decline, but who has thought that China's problems are fundamentally affected by the world situation? In order to solve the current problems, we must broaden our horizons. Our greatest demand today is to strive for the peace and unity of the country and to concentrate all our efforts to complete the task of nation-building, but the current world is interdependent and closely related. If we hope that our country can be peaceful for a long time, we must further promote world peace.

The American politician Wilson said: "Young people in turbulent times should be calm and deal with changes." We feel that the more chaotic the times, the more we should be calm and deal with problems with an objective attitude. Young people are full of energy, and they are激烈的and impatient when they encounter things. This is because they do not understand the principle of seeking progress in stability. Even for middle school and college students who are still in school, they should know how to restrain themselves and strive to improve themselves when human and material resources are so scarce and they still have the opportunity to study. Intellectual youth are the hope of the nation, and they should set a good example for the people so that they can form a force that shifts customs and stabilizes people's hearts.

Our Chinese nation has gradually declined to this day. Young people who are determined to serve the country should strive to strengthen themselves and strive for excellence. There is no other way to serve the country other than to study hard, enrich their knowledge and skills,鍛鍊 their bodies, and temper their personality. During the Second World War, many scientists in Europe and the United States devoted themselves to laboratories to conduct scientific research. Their spirit of seeking knowledge is worth emulating. Young people should also cultivate moral courage in order to shoulder the arduous task of nation-building. Sages have said: "One's integrity is revealed in times of distress, leaving a lasting impression on history!" Without the courage to die for one's country, how can we engage in the great cause of founding a nation? How can we implement the ideal of "creating peace for all generations"? Young people are the key to the safety of the country and society, and they should strive to be a responsible helmsman in the great waves of the times. Zeng Zi said: "A scholar cannot be without breadth of mind and firm resolve, for his burden is heavy and his road is long." As young students who are intellectuals, they should be deeply vigilant, study hard, conduct thorough research, and diligently work within their duties, and bear the responsibility of knowledge for academics and culture.

Ibsen has a famous saying: "You must mold this material into a useful tool." In addition to receiving education at school, young students must also pay attention to self-cultivation and鍛鍊 themselves into useful people. True gold is refined in fire. If young people want to hope to achieve something and do something, then they must go through a lot of鍛鍊. As the saying goes, "Sincerity can penetrate metal and stone." Being in the current great era, young people have a good opportunity to grasp the opportunity to砥礪鍊, and I hope everyone cherishes it!

### Anglo-American-French Note to the Bonn Council: West German Constitution Relaxes Restrictions; General Agreement Reached Between Two Major German Parties on Federal Finances and Legislative Powers

[Reuter, Bonn, 24th] Leaders of the parties in the West German Constituent Assembly have reached agreement on key points in drafting the constitution, with only one point remaining to be negotiated, namely the teaching of religious subjects in national schools. The Social Democratic Party and the Christian Democratic Party still have different opinions on this point. In the 48 hours before the party leaders reached a general agreement, the Allies had submitted a softened note to the German leaders, relaxing the restrictions on drafting the West German constitution. Regarding the distribution of financial and legislative powers between the federal and state governments, the party leaders have drafted an agreed formula, the details of which have been submitted to the three military governors for review at a meeting with the German leaders tomorrow. On the financial side, the Allies' recommendation has been accepted, agreeing that each state will establish a tax bureau, but the federal government may also collect certain types of taxes to maintain its own expenditures. The new proposal on legislative powers stipulates that the powers of the federal parliament will be slightly reduced, but less than what the Social Democrats had advocated. Laws relating to local taxes in each state will be subsidized by the federal government in terms of finance. The laws of each state and those relating to state borders and the establishment of new federal authorities must still be approved by the federal parliament. In addition to the financial and legislative proposals, the other parties are prepared to agree in principle to the Social Democrats' request to shorten the content of the draft constitution, but on the point of religious education, the Christian Democrats are still unwilling to pass a provision that parents decide on their children's religious education. The Social Democrats suggested today that this matter be determined by each state, as the right to education is usually in the hands of the state governments. The leaders of the Constituent Assembly hope that this issue of religious education can be resolved as soon as possible so that the final constitution can be passed in early May and submitted to the general assembly for a final vote in mid-May. If this is the case, elections can be expected to be held before the harvest, so that a government can be established in the summer.

[US News Agency, Washington, 25th] A new memorandum expressing the views of the United States, Britain, and France on German basic law has been sent to the German parliamentary committee in Bonn. It states that the three foreign ministers cannot currently agree to include Berlin in the initial organization of the German Federal Republic. The memorandum also reveals that the Allies will give "sympathetic consideration" to any provision that promotes the "financial independence and proper strength" of the state and federal governments. The stalemate in the West German constitution is due to disagreements between the two major parties in the Bonn Constituent Assembly, one being the powerful Social Democratic Party and the other being the more conservative Christian Democratic Party. The Socialist Party, which controls about one-third of the votes in parliament, has called for the establishment of a strong central government in West Germany. The Christian Democratic Party advocates a loose federation that emphasizes the rights of the provinces, a plan that is more in line with the general views of the three foreign ministers.

### Congress in Support of World Peace: 100,000 People Demonstrate in Paris, Holding Anti-War Banners and Singing the Internationale

[Reuter, Paris, 24th] More than 100,000 people in support of peace gathered from cities in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands to demonstrate in support of the World Peace Congress.

The slogans held by the crowd included "Long live the Franco-Soviet alliance," "Peace in Indonesia," "Peace in Viet Minh," "The Atlantic Pact is a death pact," and "French mothers will never allow their sons to participate in a war against the Soviet Union." Three Greek girls dressed as farmers held a banner that read "The Greek people are fighting for peace." The representatives of the 50 countries of the Peace Congress and the demonstrators marched around the track in the stadium.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 24th] Today, the crowd marched and sang "La Marseillaise" and Communist youth songs. Curie, the host of French atomic energy research, declared to the crowd, "We will resolutely resist those who commit the heinous crime of inciting war in the name of democracy, freedom, and peace. We declare here that our entire responsibility is peace. We will surely win." American writer Howard Fast said, "Freedom of opinion in the United States is often only an illusion. American prisons are often full of political prisoners. I wish I could say that my people will refuse war, but I only know that millions of American workers want peace."

The new deployment has now been concretely completed. Now the National Army has reached the point of unbearable endurance, and we have no choice but to rise up and fight.

However, the only hope for people in the community at present is not to listen to rumors, to disturb themselves and others, so as to disrupt society. I must solemnly tell people from all walks of life here that anyone who manufactures rumors, gathers crowds to coerce, attempts to incite people's hearts, and workers who slack off and strike, and who incite student movements, control schools, and engage in reactionary behavior, will be treated as spies according to the wartime emergency measures regulations.

### Airplanes, Ships, and Trains All Fully Booked: Population Certificates Required for Travel to Taiwan, Otherwise Landing Absolutely Prohibited

Due to the tense situation, there is a high demand for all modes of transportation. Airplanes, ships, and trains are all fully booked. Airplane tickets are expensive and unaffordable for ordinary people. All ship routes from Shanghai to Taiwan, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou are fully booked. However, there is a severe shortage of cash in the market, making it difficult to purchase tickets. Furthermore, passengers traveling to Taiwan must have a population certificate from the Taiwan Provincial Government.

### Wife, Children, Son-in-Law, and Daughter Die in Plane Crash: Alone and "Unable to Bear It": Shanghai Zhengzhong Bookstore General Manager Jiang Zhicheng Dies by Poison; Will States "Missing Family and Worrying About the Nation," Requests Exemption from Inspection and Cremation

[Report from Our Newspaper] Jiang Zhicheng, former mayor of Chongqing and current general manager of Shanghai Zhengzhong Bookstore, suddenly committed suicide by poison at his residence at 55 Yongan Lane, North Sichuan Road, at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Although discovered by a maid, it was too late, and he died. Jiang's experience can be described as tragically devastating.

Since then, Jiang has been alone, and every time he thought of it, his heart was torn. Now, with the current situation, his worries have increased, and he ultimately died by poison.

### Tenants' General Federation Expresses Dissent to Draft Amendments to Housing Rent Standards

The city government has finalized the amendments to the housing rent standards in this city, which will be implemented after being discussed and approved by the City Council. Upon hearing this news, the Tenants' General Federation of this city held an emergency meeting and unanimously resolved that the draft proposed by the city government differs greatly from the content of the City Council's previous resolution to revise the maximum rent limit. They firmly expressed their opposition and requested that the City Council seriously revise it for the sake of the livelihood of citizens and the stability of social order. Their reasons for opposition are as follows:

(1) The original proposal of the City Council was to revise the maximum rent limit. However, Article 1 of the current method stipulates that the rental amount should be agreed upon by the landlord and tenant. Only when an agreement cannot be reached will the provisions of the method apply. The intention of this is the opposite of the provision for a maximum limit. The provision for a maximum limit is a rigid law, while the current method is too flexible and will hardly have legal effect. (2) According to the 7,000-fold and 9,000-fold method passed by the City Council in March of last year, the increase in living expenses from March to the end of August of last year was added. Assuming that the calculation was made at the beginning of September of last year using legal tender converted to gold yuan certificates, then one yuan of pre-war rent, when adjusted to gold yuan certificates, would only be 4.2 to 5.2 fen (equivalent to 4% and 5.2%). However, the current method adjusts it to 15% or 25%, which is too high. (3) Since housing rent is divided into several grades according to the amount of pre-war rent, and commercial housing was originally higher than residential housing before the war, it is inappropriate to further increase the percentage on the base number.

### Central Bank Pays Salaries in Silver Dollars: Ministry of Finance Orders Recall

[Report from Our Newspaper] Premier He of the Executive Yuan recently informed various agencies in Shanghai that they are not allowed to issue so-called contingency funds. It was also stipulated that except for combat troops who may be paid in silver dollars, no other agency may pay salaries in silver dollars to avoid disturbing public morale and affecting social order. It is now reported that the Bank of China, without authorization, paid its employees in silver dollars as contingency evacuation funds. Upon learning of this news, the Ministry of Finance considered it a violation of government regulations and has ordered the bank to recall the funds by a certain date to comply with the law.

### Cash Shortage Expected to Improve Today: Business Market Sluggish, Mostly Just Settling Accounts

[Report from Our Newspaper] As the situation changes rapidly, transactions in various industries yesterday mostly took a "sweep before your own door" attitude. In addition, negotiable instruments are not valid for same-day use, which has been repeated. Firms with capital lent out have withdrawn it to cope with possible storms. This has created a phenomenon of tightness outside the industry while it's loose inside the industry. However, the daily interest rate has fallen back to between 200 and 300 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Market prices in general, except for vegetables in the small vegetable market, have fallen drastically.

Yesterday, most commercial markets were not receptive to promissory note transactions. On the retail side, many refused to accept them, which created an unprecedented cash shortage. The discount rate for promissory notes has risen to over 30%. The Central Bank stated that since government agencies at all levels have relocated to Shanghai, coupled with frequent military and government disbursements, the need for cash is even more than in the past. Therefore, the withdrawal amount for general commercial firms is only 10% of the previous day's deposits. However, according to a person in charge of the National Bank who spoke to reporters, the amount of temporary disbursements from the national treasury will be less starting today, so the supply of general cash is expected to increase. Because various firms were unable to collect cash yesterday morning, the cash position was particularly tight in the morning. In the evening, as part of the cash collected by various parties came out, it became looser, and the market for various financial items also rebounded.

[Another Report] Yesterday, transactions in various markets were few. Most major markets were mostly dealing with unfinished business, and new transactions were temporarily suspended. All market prices were only nominal. The financial market also reported losses. Interbank lending decreased sharply, and all parties adopted a cautious attitude. Industrial and commercial firms used gold as collateral to banks. In the early morning, the price was 450 million yuan, but later, as speculators dumped gold and banknotes to pay off debts, the market price fell again to 350 million yuan, with more selling than buying. Except for banks with surplus capital who took the opportunity to buy at low prices, there were few buyers. Industrial and commercial firms and speculators, due to capital constraints, had no choice but to use gold and banknotes as collateral at low prices for loans and borrowing. Most of the transactions involved liquidation, and interest rates were chaotic.

### Gold Market Transactions Few, Silver Dollars Initially Weak but Later Firm

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday in the gold market, the price inside the market remained unchanged at the upper limit of 21.672 million yuan. In the off-exchange futures market, customer and company transactions were settled at 63 million yuan. Spot transactions were chaotic, between 300 million and 400 million yuan, and transactions were few. Off-exchange US dollar transactions were also chaotic. In street transactions, 6.5 yuan in US dollars exchanged for 10 yuan in silver dollars, only about 300,000 yuan. Same-day spot transactions were quoted between 700,000 and 800,000 yuan, also informal.

Yesterday, silver dollar arbitrage was completely suspended. Street transactions were initially weak but later firm. In the morning, due to the rapidly deteriorating situation, various orders flowed back to Shanghai. With public morale stabilizing, supply exceeded demand, and there was a wave of selling. Silver dollars once fell below 300,000 yuan, down to 270,000 and 320,000 yuan. It rose slightly to 300,000 and 350,000 yuan near noon. In the afternoon, due to a large amount of contingency funds flowing out, banks and companies tried their best to collect them, and the price rose to 400,000 yuan in the evening. Small silver dollars were quoted at 300,000 and 350,000 yuan, and foreign silver dollars were quoted at 220,000 and 270,000 yuan. Due to general panic, the price of promissory notes was 50% higher than the price of cash. Silver dollars traded at 400,000 and 500,000 yuan in the morning and rose to 600,000 and 650,000 yuan in the afternoon, not much different from last weekend.

Yesterday, jewelry stores selling gold jewelry suspended business due to the chaotic market conditions and did not post prices all day. Money exchange shops also did not post prices.

Cloth Trading: Suspended

Yesterday, the cloth market was deserted due to the sudden change in the situation. Everyone was suspicious and dared not act rashly, and trading was suspended. As for the factories opening for business, most of them calculated prices using silver dollars, but there were few inquiries. Wholesale prices were very chaotic, with Four Gentlemen poplin ranging from 5 yuan to 5.8 yuan, and 190 Prussian Blue ranging from 11 yuan to 15 yuan. Business was also quite sluggish. The nearby towns were close to the war zone and had no intention of buying goods, and "single runners" had disappeared due to transportation problems.

Chinese Stocks Neglected

The stock exchange yesterday stipulated that the morning and afternoon sessions would be calculated as one trading area and announced that starting today, 50% of the clearing deposit will be collected for the remaining balance of the day's clearing transactions. Due to the wait-and-see attitude, the market was neglected. Yongsha initially traded at 300 yuan, then immediately stopped rising. Other stocks were also rarely priced. Taiwan Sugar and Rongfeng both stopped rising, Jingfu fell to the limit at 11:05, and Huafeng also fell to 4.42 yuan at that time. Meiya initially traded at 6.2 yuan, once rose to 6.84 yuan, and finally fell to 5 yuan. Hengfeng also closed at the lower limit. As a result, there were mixed increases and decreases compared to the previous day.

The market's mood became increasingly cold, and the market atmosphere was deserted, with few offers. Yongsha initially traded at 290 yuan and then rose to 300 yuan. Later, it gradually cooled down and closed at 275 yuan, down 20 yuan from the afternoon price, but still up 24 yuan from last Saturday. Meiya initially traded at 5.2 yuan, once fell to 4.8 yuan, and finally traded at 5.8 yuan. Huafeng and Xinguang moved in different directions, with Xinguang falling 8 jiao compared to the afternoon, and Huafeng rising 5.8 jiao compared to the afternoon. Lianan, Guohuo, and Rongfeng all closed at the upper limit. The total trading volume for the day was 416.6 million shares, including 30.3 million shares of Yongsha.

There were no transactions in gold bonds in the morning or afternoon.

Rice Prices Plummet

Yesterday in the grain market, because bank notes were absolutely not allowed to be used on the same day, buyers and sellers adopted a wait-and-see approach, and most transactions were suspended. All parties were rushing to settle matters. However, rice was still traded. Due to the drastic changes in the situation, various parties sold, and white rice plummeted to 2.3 million yuan, equivalent to 5.5 silver dollars. The off-exchange prices of other flour, cooking oil, and grains all plummeted in unison. When converted to silver dollars, bingchuan was quoted at 1.5 yuan, and lao che was quoted at 1.8 yuan, but there were few inquiries. Soybean oil was quoted at 27 yuan, crude oil was quoted at 26 yuan, crude rapeseed oil was quoted at 24 yuan, Sangyuan soybeans were quoted at 4 yuan, and Hankou yellow sesame was quoted at 8 yuan, all plummeting by 30% to 40%.

### Headless Female Corpse Found on Fanhangdu Road: Suspected Owner of Guangming Barber Shop Flees with Entire Family

[Report from Our Newspaper] A headless female corpse was discovered in the mud of a stinking river in Jinjia Lane, Fanhangdu Road, West Shanghai, at around 6:00 AM yesterday. The deceased was about thirty years old, completely naked, and covered with a burlap sack. After someone reported it to the Jiangning Road Police Substation, officers were dispatched to investigate and learned that the Guangming Barber Shop was located in a wooden shed nearby. The shop owner had a violent argument with his wife and concubines the night before over family matters. After dawn, the entire family abandoned the shop and fled, which seemed suspicious. After officers investigated the shop, they found blood stains and messy footprints, indicating that the victim was likely his concubine. The officers in charge are now searching for the shop owner to bring him to justice.

### Cash Shortage Returns: Central Bank Cashes in Cheaply

After shops refused to accept bank notes and checks, the cash shortage has become severe again.

Shops are guarding against the sudden closing of banks.

The Gold Management Bureau yesterday ordered all industries to prohibit the refusal of accepting notes. But all industries still refuse to accept them. What to do?

The only solution is to release cash. It is reported that a large amount of cash was released into the market yesterday afternoon. It may ease today.

Starting last Friday, the Central Bank stopped actively collecting silver dollars and instead passively collected silver dollars.

The market price of silver dollars plummeted, and the Central Bank passively collected a large number of cheap silver dollars. This is a good strategy, so even though there is an urgent need for military silver dollars, the Central Bank is still adopting a passive silver dollar collection policy. And silver dollar merchants who need cash must actively sell to the Central Bank.

Heavy, cumbersome things, market prices are falling day by day. The reason, of course, is the overall situation. The immediate reason is the tight cash and the refusal to accept notes. So even though it's falling, there are still few transactions, and it has almost become a deadlock with prices but no market.

Because of the extreme shortage of cash, bare trading not only has two prices, cash price and note price, but also the note price is five or six times higher than the cash price.

It's truly shocking.
