### Executive Yuan Holds Meeting in Guangzhou, Passes Financial Reform Plan, Readjusts Salaries for Government Employees and Teachers Again Starting in March, Wuzhou Designated as Foreign Trade Port

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] A new economic reform plan was passed yesterday during the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting held in Guangzhou. The details have not yet been announced, but it is widely rumored in financial circles in this city that in the future, one silver dollar will be equivalent to 1,200 gold yuan, one tael of gold will be worth 100 silver dollars, and one US dollar will be equivalent to two silver dollars. This rumor has not been confirmed, but relevant parties indicate that it has some basis. Furthermore, Liu Gongyun, President of the Central Bank, has completed his official business in Guangzhou and will be heading to Hong Kong in the coming days to negotiate with influential parties, as the implementation of the new plan relies on the cooperation of all parties.

[Our Newspaper's Guangzhou Dispatch, 23rd] The Executive Yuan continued to hold its 45th meeting in Guangzhou on the 23rd, both in the morning and afternoon. Premier Sun chaired the meeting, with Vice Premier Wu and heads of various ministries and commissions in attendance. The following important proposals were passed:

Matters for Discussion: (1) In order to alleviate current financial and economic difficulties and improve people's livelihoods, the Ministry of Finance, led by Minister Xu, and Chief Accountant Pang, in consultation with relevant agencies, drafted a financial and economic reform plan. It was resolved to be amended and passed, and submitted to the President to invoke temporary provisions, first announcing its implementation, and then amending relevant laws to supplement the legislative process. (2) To strengthen the organization and rectify discipline, the first step should be to adjust the structure and unify authority, so as to improve efficiency and simplify procedures. It was resolved in principle to first start with the Executive Yuan, making reasonable adjustments and mergers, and after the Premier and Vice Premier make a decision, it will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for approval and implementation. (3) Although the salaries of government employees and teachers were generally adjusted in February, due to rising prices, they are still insufficient. On the 23rd, it was resolved to adjust salaries in March, and the Ministries of Finance and Budgeting were instructed to promptly draft and submit a proposal for approval. As for the food allowance for employees of central agencies that have relocated, the amount for March will remain the same as in February, and will be distributed separately. In addition, regarding the original system of providing rations in kind, how to raise and distribute them after the government's relocation to Guangzhou was also decided to be discussed by the relevant competent authorities, and a proposal will be promptly drafted and submitted for approval. (4) The Ministry of Finance proposed: Wuzhou was originally a trading port before the war, and Chinese and foreign ships could load goods from that port for export, or foreign ships could carry goods to that port for import. However, after the war, the government stipulated overseas commercial trade ports, and this port was not included. As a result, direct commercial trade between Wuzhou and Hong Kong and Macau ceased. Wuzhou merchants exporting local products must go through the Guangzhou Customs for export, and imported foreign goods must also go through the Guangzhou Customs for import before being transported to Wuzhou. The merchants of Guangxi Province, in view of the decline of trade in the port, have repeatedly requested the Provincial Council and the Provincial Government to forward a request to open the port. Considering the current situation, it is no longer comparable to the past. In order to meet current needs, promote export trade, and earn foreign exchange, it is proposed to designate Wuzhou as an open port for foreign trade, so that Guangxi local products can be directly exported from Wuzhou, and foreign goods from Hong Kong and Macau can be directly imported from Wuzhou, which will be of great benefit to the national economy. The resolution was passed.

### Yan Huiqing and Shao Lizi

Rumored to Go to Shijiazhuang for "Sightseeing"

Wu Yu-hou and Others Leave Hong Kong Today to Return to Guangzhou

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] San Francisco, 23rd (Broadcast): The Shaanxi Northern Communist Radio Station broadcast a message from Peiping stating that Lin Biao, Luo Ronghuan, Nie Rongzhen, Ye Jianying, Dong Biwu, Bo Yibo, and other Communist Party leaders in Peiping invited 386 democratic figures, including Zhang Xiruo, to a banquet at the Beijing Hotel at 3:00 PM on the 20th. Yan Huiqing, Shao Lizi, Zhang Shizhao, Jiang Yong, and others who came to Peiping for discussions in their personal capacity also attended the invitation. A film about democratic Northeast China was shown after the banquet.

[United Press, Peiping, 23rd] It is learned that Yan Huiqing and Shao Lizi went to Shijiazhuang for "sightseeing" yesterday, accompanied by several officials from the North China People's Government.

[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 23rd] According to sources from North China, the reports from foreign news agencies recently, stating that Mao Zedong had met with Shao Lizi, are denied. It is also claimed that if such a meeting were to be held, its purpose would only be to provide Mao Zedong with some advice.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 23rd] A high-ranking official confirmed the news reports that the initial contact between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in Peiping had made significant progress. However, on the other hand, although Acting President Li personally went to Guangzhou to try to bridge the gap between Nanjing and Guangzhou, the progress is not enough to support an optimistic outlook for peace talks. It is also reliably reported that Shao Lizi telegraphed Li Zongren, reporting the details of his talks with the Communist Party authorities in Peiping. Although the exact content was not revealed, it is said that the report used an optimistic tone, stating that efforts to narrow the distance between the two sides have made progress.

[Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, 23rd] Professor Wu Yuhou announced that he would return to Guangzhou on the morning of the 24th and would no longer contact the Communist Party and liberal factions in Hong Kong, as they refused to meet with him. When he and his two companions met with reporters, they claimed that Li Zongren and Sun Ke approved of their peace movement, but did not mention what organization they represented. Hong Kong newspapers indicated that they were mentors of the Kuomintang Youth League, and his two companions were considered to be former police officers.

Wang believes that the "war criminal" issue raised by the Chinese Communist Party is a novel concept. He also stated that the 24 special criminal courts nationwide have been abolished by order, and political prisoners who have not yet been sentenced have also been completely released. As for those who have already been sentenced, they can be pardoned after Acting President Li approves.

### Legislative Yuan Holds Discussion Meeting Yesterday, Suggests Holding a Resumption Ceremony Within the Month, The Issue of "Focused Discussion" Will Be Studied Separately

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] Legislative members who arrived in Nanjing held a discussion meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday to exchange views on various issues. More than 20 legislative members attended, with Yang Youjiong presiding. Huang Zhengzhi, Xu Pan-yun, Cheng Yuanzhen, and others who came to Nanjing from Shanghai and Hangzhou reported on the opinions of the legislative members in Shanghai and Hangzhou. Mr. Dong stated that about 30 legislative members in Hangzhou may come to Nanjing on the 24th. Mr. Huang believes that during this extraordinary period, the meetings of the Legislative Yuan should change from the usual format and implement focused discussions, first focusing on (1) the peace issue, (2) whether it is necessary to move the meeting location, (3) the policy guidelines of the new Executive Yuan, and (4) the urgent need for reform issues, such as commodity prices and the salaries of government employees and teachers. Xu Pan-yun agreed with Mr. Dong's proposal, but said that the current focus should be on (1) the peace issue, (2) the issue of reforming the currency system, and (3) the issue of rectifying official corruption and military discipline. He also hoped that the Secretariat would prepare materials for discussion. During the meeting, it was agreed that a separate discussion meeting should be held to study the issue of focused discussion. As for the date of resumption, it was unanimously agreed to make a suggestion to President Tong Guangsheng, hoping that a resumption ceremony would be held within the month, and then the meeting would be scheduled to be held at a later date.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] The third session of the Legislative Yuan will resume in Nanjing within this month, which is almost certain. Legislative members who have arrived in Nanjing believe that according to the Constitution, the Legislative Yuan should meet in February, and the Legislative Yuan should not violate the Constitution. On the 23rd, it was decided to suggest to President Tong Guanxian that a date be decided within the month to hold a resumption ceremony, and the official opening of the meeting could be postponed for a few days to promote unity. As for the different opinions of the legislative members in Guangzhou, there is nothing too serious. President Tong telephoned Guangzhou long distance on the 22nd and learned that the legislative members in Guangzhou were not completely opposed to holding the meeting in Nanjing. They argued that there was no need to rush to hold the meeting, and it would be best to postpone it for a few days to wait for them to obtain transportation to go north. Legislative members continued to register on the 23rd. Those who registered on the 23rd included Wang Youxi, Xu Fanyun, Luo Xiatian, Cheng Yuanzhen, Lu Guanting, Bai Jianmin, Ma Shucheng, Huang Zhengzhi, and others, mostly from Shanghai and Hangzhou. Before today, there were a total of 56 people. According to what was learned on the 23rd, the legislative members in Wuhan and Guilin have agreed on an aircraft and can arrive in Nanjing on the 24th or 25th. Legislative members in Shanghai and Hangzhou will arrive gradually from the 24th, and it is expected that they will arrive in Nanjing before the end of the month. Legislative members can reach the legal quorum of more than one-fifth, or 156 people.

### Legislative Members Staying in Guangzhou Request Postponement of Resumption, Tong Guanxian Replies by Telegram Explaining

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] The Liaison Association of Legislative Members Staying in Guangzhou sent a telegram to Tong Guanxian, President of the Legislative Yuan, on the 22nd, expressing dissenting views on the resumption of the Yuan in Nanjing. He replied with a special telegram on the 23rd, explaining the reasons, stating that: "I have just read the open telegram from the Liaison Association of Legislative Members Staying in Guangzhou in the Central News Agency news, and it is earnest and sincere, stating that the recent notice to resume the meeting in Nanjing was made in strict accordance with the opinions of the majority of colleagues and based on the current security situation in Nanjing and the provisions of the Constitution. As for the time of resumption, according to the current transportation situation, colleagues are scattered in various places, and the date of the notice can no longer be postponed. I plan to wait until the legal resumption is held as scheduled, and then discuss with the attending colleagues to postpone the discussion of major issues for a few days, waiting for colleagues from afar to arrive in Nanjing to discuss together."

### Legislative Members Zou Zhifen and Others Exchange Views on Resumption

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Zou Zhifen, Chen Zifeng, Wu Yunpeng, Lin Dong, Pan Chaoying, He Zuozhi, and six other legislative members dispatched by the legislative members staying in Guangzhou arrived in Shanghai by plane from Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 23rd, and immediately exchanged views with the legislative members staying in Shanghai on the issue of the meeting location. At the same time, they telegraphed President Tong Guanxian, who was busy preparing for the resumption in Nanjing, requesting that he respect the opinions of the legislative members staying in Guangzhou and conduct a vote to decide on the location of the meeting. Furthermore, they were extremely busy after arriving in Shanghai, and will continue to discuss the issue of the resumption of the Legislative Yuan with the legislative members staying in Shanghai at the New Life Club at 3:00 PM on the 24th.

### Communist Party "Establishes Capital" in Peiping, with Dong Biwu as the Head of Administration

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to Peiping Communist Radio, the Communist Party's "North China People's Government" formally moved into Peiping on the 20th of this month, and the office should be temporarily located at the old site of the Peiping Bankers' Association on Xipishi Street.

[Associated Press, Peiping, 23rd] The Communist Party has formally established a government and made Peiping its capital. The Communist Party is taking various steps to make this ancient capital of the Qing Dynasty, a cultural and political center, the administrative center of North China under the control of the Communist Party. The formal announcement was issued on the 23rd that the "government" had moved from Shijiazhuang to Peiping. But according to the announcement issued by the Chinese Communist Party, this move to the capital began on February 20. The announcement is accompanied by several detailed rules, mainly signed by Dong Biwu, a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, who will be the head of the administrative region here.

As for whether this move of the capital by the Communist Party will affect the time and other arrangements for the Shanghai Peace Delegation to hold peace talks with the leaders of the Communist Party, it is not yet known immediately. The administrative departments that have been established here to date include the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Education, Finance, Industry and Commerce, Agriculture, Public Enterprises, Transportation, Public Health, Public Security, and Justice. (According to United Press, there are nine departments, namely Civil Affairs, Education, Finance, Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, Transportation, Health, Justice, and Labor. In addition, there are the North China Finance and Economy Company, the North China Water Conservancy Bureau, the North China People's Court, and the North China People's Bank.) So far, the Communist Party government has formally moved from Shijiazhuang, where it was established on September 20 last year, to Peiping. Apart from Dong Biwu being the head of the administrative authorities, other senior leaders of the Communist Party were not mentioned, at least not for the time being. As for what position and whereabouts Mao Zedong will hold, it was not clearly indicated. At the same time, there is no doubt that Mao will continue to fully guide the policies of the Communist Party. The announcement also did not mention whether this move will affect the scheduled plan for the Shanghai Peace Delegation to go to Shijiazhuang for a meeting with Mao Zedong.

The local newspapers often publish in a limited capacity that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party may seek a common ground to lead to a basis for peace talks. On the 23rd, the newspapers published very little information on this matter. Today, the newspapers focused on the "new government's" plans for "foreign" trade. Shao Lizi, Yan Huiqing, and other members of the Shanghai delegation have flown to Shijiazhuang to meet with Mao, or the Communist Party's decision to move the capital has delayed the original plan from being announced.

It is generally believed that the Communist Party will soon announce a plan that foreign and Chinese merchants will be allowed to come to Peiping to engage in commerce between North China and other parts of China and foreign countries.

[Local News] According to news from Peiping on the 23rd, the Peiping Military Control Commission took over the Palace Museum on the 19th.

(4) Cut unnecessary agencies and reduce expenditures, which will be submitted for discussion at the upcoming political affairs meeting.

### Acting President Li Changes Flight to Changsha Today, Has Not Yet Considered Whether to Go to Peiping, Guilin Welcome Rally Canceled Due to Rain

[Our Newspaper's Guilin Dispatch, 23rd] Acting President Li summoned personnel below the Secretary-General of the Provincial Government at 7:30 AM on the 23rd and gave them a lot of advice. The planned 9:00 AM speech at the citizens' welcome rally was canceled due to rain. The Acting President took time to return to his hometown in Liangjiang Township to pay respects to his ancestors. The elders and children welcomed him in the rain. The National Assembly representatives staying in Guilin submitted a letter of opinion to the Acting President on the 23rd, the main points of which were to abolish the Suppression of Rebellion Committee, amend Article 174 of the Constitution, reform politics, stabilize finances, and improve the treatment of government employees and teachers. The Acting President is scheduled to fly to Changsha on the 24th.

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 23rd] Acting President Li is on a Southern tour. The word from Guilin is that he plans to visit Hunan along the way, which is exciting news. Grand preparations are underway to welcome him.

Director Huang Xuechun Answers Reporters' Questions on Behalf of the President

[Central News Agency, Guilin, 23rd] Acting President Li was originally scheduled to meet with reporters from local newspapers at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 22nd, but due to being busy, the meeting was changed to be attended by Huang Xuechun, Director of the Second Bureau of the Presidential Office, on his behalf. The questions and answers are as follows:

Q: What is the significance of Acting President's Southern tour?

A: The intention is to visit various places. He explained in a written statement in Guangzhou.

Q: What is the future of peace?

Q: What has the People's Peace Delegation gained from its contact with the Communist Party in Peiping recently?

A: I have not received the correct information.

Q: It is reported that Xinhua News Agency broadcast that Communist Party leader Mao Zedong welcomes the Acting President to Peiping. Is the Acting President prepared to go?

A: The Acting President has not yet considered this matter.

Q: The Communist army is making new deployments in Jiangbei again. Is there an attempt to cross the river and invade the south?

A: According to Mao Zedong's broadcast, military action will not stop until peace is achieved. From this point of view, we cannot say that they have no intention of invading the south. Peace is being accelerated, and we hope that the Communist army crossing the river will not become a reality.

Q: What important decisions were made at the Executive Yuan's regular meeting in Guangzhou?

A: The meeting discussed the economic reform issue and decided on a new plan, which will be announced soon.

Q: Can the contents of the plan be revealed?

A: It is not yet time to announce it. Finally, Mr. Huang also said that Premier Sun is determined to go to Nanjing in the coming days.

### Reception of Reporters and Responses to Inquiries: A Spirited and Pleasant Conversation
### Zhang Zhizhong Discusses the Future of Peace: Everyone Wants Peace, Success is Certain. Whether or Not to Go to Beiping is Still Undecided

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] General Zhang Zhizhong, the government's peace talk representative, received reporters from various newspapers at his private residence in Shenjuren Lane at 5:00 PM on the 23rd, answering various inquiries. More than thirty reporters attended, filling Zhang's reception room to capacity. It was the first time in over a month that so many reporters had gathered in one place since the political atmosphere in the capital became quiet. Zhang entered the reception room at 5:00 PM sharp, dressed in a traditional long gown and mandarin jacket, looking very elegant. He answered reporters' questions, conversing with spirit and often laughing heartily, creating a lively and pleasant atmosphere. The Q&A session lasted an hour. He addressed issues of great concern to the general public: (1) the peace talks, (2) the Northwest issue, and (3) the Sino-Soviet treaty regarding trade and economic cooperation in Xinjiang. Finally, he also discussed the issue of the Executive Yuan's relocation to the South.

Answering questions about the peace talks, Zhang maintained his consistent optimistic view. He said: "I have always been optimistic, and I am optimistic about everything." A reporter asked for the reason for his optimism. Zhang laughed and said: "Optimism is optimism, and the reason doesn't need to be deeply understood." He then explained: "It is very clear that now it is not just us who want peace, but the people want peace, and the whole world wants peace. Doesn't the Communist Party want peace? Everyone wants peace, and peace will eventually be successful. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party have fought for twenty years, so of course the peace talks will have twists and turns, but in the end, I am still optimistic." A reporter asked why he had resigned as a peace talk representative and whether the reason for his resignation was because he was pessimistic about the peace talks. Zhang quickly replied: "No! Because one person cannot carry two burdens. When I was in the Northwest, everyone did not want me to leave the Northwest and did not approve of me being a peace talk representative, because if I became a peace talk representative, I could not take care of the affairs of the Northwest." Zhang explained his resignation as a representative by saying: "But if the central government insists that I do it, I have no choice. I hope the central government will not ask me to do it." Answering the question of whether he would go to Beiping recently, Zhang said: "It's still too early to say. Perhaps it can only be decided after Mr. Shao returns. Before Mr. Shao went to Beiping, he sent a telegram from Shanghai to Lanzhou, saying that he had decided to go to Beiping, 'regardless of gains or losses', hoping that I could come to Beijing; there has been no news since he arrived in Beiping." A reporter further asked: "If Acting President Li asks Mr. Zhang to go to Beiping now, would you be willing to go?" Zhang still said: "It is still too early to say. If that happens, I will give you a hypothetical answer." Regarding the criticism he received in the two broadcasts by the Chinese Communist Party, Zhang said that he would remain "silent". When a reporter asked for his views on the CCP's eight peace conditions, Zhang said he did not want to express an opinion. When a reporter asked for his opinion on the issue of war criminals, Zhang smiled and asked the reporter: "Are you a war criminal?" Then he laughed.

### Northwestern Economic Plan Submitted to the Central Government for Approval

Regarding the Northwest issue, Zhang first stated in his answer that the Northwest Military and Political Conference was only a platform for everyone to exchange views on the overall situation and the Northwest issue. The rumors that there were any resolutions and that someone advocated for war, and others opposed the peace talks, are completely untrue. Their opinions are very good and fully respect the central government's peaceful decision. Regarding the economic problems in the Northwest, the Northwest has drafted an emergency economic plan for the Northwest, which has been brought to the central government for approval. The plan included a proposal for each province in the Northwest to mint its own silver coins in order to stabilize the currency value in the Northwest and to seek self-reliance in the Northwest's economy. However, if the central government does not approve it, it will naturally not be implemented. This is not the Northwest's first attempt. In fact, many provinces are already doing it. Currently, commercial transactions in the Northwest provinces are already calculated in hard currency. The gold yuan has depreciated, and the people no longer trust it. The production of hard currency is indeed necessary.

Regarding the long-unresolved Yining issue, a reporter also asked Zhang. Zhang said: "Last August, Ahematijan sent a letter with four points. In mid-February of this year, a letter was sent in response to Ahematijan, proposing five points. Both sides responded with facts. As long as the facts are achieved, the two sides will gradually move closer, and success will come naturally." A reporter asked what impact the reorganization of the Xinjiang Provincial Government would have on the Yining issue. Zhang said that it would only have a "good impact."

### Sino-Soviet Xinjiang Commercial Treaty is Under Negotiation

Speaking of the Sino-Soviet treaty on trade and economic cooperation in Xinjiang, Zhang said: "The delegation led by Liu Zerong, the Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Xinjiang, is currently negotiating with the Soviet side. In the future, it must be approved by the central government and will be officially announced. There is absolutely no secret. " He also said that the treaty has no effect on territorial sovereignty, or the mention of "patent rights." A reporter asked whether the Soviet Union had requested mining rights in Xinjiang. Zhang replied that the request was for economic cooperation, the nature of which was very ordinary. Some speculative remarks in the foreign press were due to a lack of understanding of the content of the negotiations and the historical facts of Xinjiang. This is not a current issue, but something that existed during the Sheng Shicai era. Later, when Song Ziwen was the President of the Executive Yuan, he proposed revisions to the Soviet Union. Now the Soviet Union has a suggestion to give us as a response, so negotiations are underway. The negotiations are not yet complete, and the content will be fully released in the future.

### Very Willing to Travel Between North and South to Seek Coordination Between Nanjing and Guangzhou

Finally, a reporter asked about the lack of coordination between Nanjing and Guangzhou regarding the relocation of the Executive Yuan to the South. Zhang avoided answering, but said: "President Sun invited him to Guangzhou, and he also planned to go to Guangzhou. However, he heard that President Sun would come to Nanjing soon. If President Sun comes, he will naturally no longer need to go to Guangzhou." Zhang said that if necessary, he was very willing to travel between Nanjing and Guangzhou to coordinate. Before the end of the meeting, a reporter asked again whether the rumors that President Sun had resigned and that Acting President Li was planning to invite Zhang to form a cabinet were true. Zhang also did not give a direct answer but denied it. The hour-long Q&A session ended with laughter, and Zhang shook hands with each reporter to say goodbye.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] After General Zhang Zhizhong arrived in Nanjing, he visited Gu Zhutong on the morning of the 23rd and then visited He Yingqin at noon. Also, Gui Yongqing visited Zhang's residence this morning around 10:00 AM, but Zhang had already gone out and was unable to meet him.

[This newspaper, Lanzhou, 22nd] It is reported that in addition to attending the important meetings that will be held in Nanjing, Zhang Zhizhong will also fly to Guangzhou to discuss with the central government the emergency plan for the Northwest military and political affairs, so as to obtain the central government's agreement and support. Ma Hongbin, the deputy commander of the Northwest Military and Political Affairs, and Qu Wu, the mayor of Dihua, also flew to Beijing on the same plane as Zhang on the 22nd.

[This newspaper, Lanzhou, 23rd] Qinghai Province Finance Director Tai Weibang and his party of three arrived in Lanzhou on the 23rd to discuss issues related to the Northwest Economic Contingency Plan.

Editorial

### The Current Problem of Professors' Salaries

The grass and trees sprout, and all the flowers welcome the spring. The great transformations of nature have not been thwarted by human suffering. Just like our schools at all levels, which have all started classes in sequence without being affected by the domestic war. This is indeed something that can be slightly comforting during this period of drawn-out national unrest.

During the Song Dynasty, Zhu Guangting studied under Cheng Mingyuan. Afterwards, he told people: Listening to Master Cheng's lectures is like sitting in the spring breeze. Mencius said that "there are five ways to teach," the first being "to transform like timely rain." Therefore, the "spring breeze and timely rain" has become a symbol of educational effectiveness. Currently, the whole country is unanimously seeking peace, transforming violence into auspiciousness. In this gentle spring breeze and misty spring rain, students in various schools can still continue to study and enjoy school education that nurtures the next generation. We should naturally celebrate for the young students, and even more so for the future of the country and the nation.

However, the facts themselves are not entirely optimistic. The bright side has its shadows. The spring breeze inevitably carries a bit of the biting spring cold, and the summer rain may even be mixed with hail. Without discussing primary and secondary education for the time being, just looking at the current higher education, neither the school equipment nor the academic standards can compare with those before the war. The educational environment and teaching morale are also deteriorating. Especially in the past six months, first, schools in Shenyang and Changchun and other cities entered the customs in a roundabout way, and then schools in North China, Henan, and Shandong moved to the south of the Yangtze River. The central education authorities had no secret plans beforehand, and no proper arrangements afterwards. None of these schools have managed to avoid being fragmented and unable to hold classes. Teachers and students have also been displaced and complained bitterly.

As for education funding, it was originally allocated according to the Constitution, accounting for a limited portion of the national treasury budget. The allocation standards were also unreasonable. Affected by the depreciation of the currency and rising prices, it became even more strained. After the Executive Yuan moved south, it failed to issue funds on time and make reasonable adjustments. The chief education officer was nowhere to be found, making most vocational schools and above virtually ownerless. Take the recent visit to Beijing by representatives of the Nanjing National Vocational Schools and Above Professors' Association in the middle of this month to request emergency food relief funds. Only 100 million yuan was barely obtained, which was distributed among the schools. It is easy to imagine that it was a drop in the bucket.

Furthermore, the salaries of teachers in general colleges and universities are based on the same standards as civil servants at all levels. According to a letter to the public issued by professors of national colleges and universities in this city on the 20th of this month: "In terms of the current income, it is not enough to buy two dou of rice. If used to buy vegetables, it is not enough for half a catty of vegetables per day. The annual income is not enough to pay for the water, electricity, and gas bills for one month. Even with the allocation of three dou of rice, it is not enough for one person's mouth. As for the so-called academic research subsidy, professors receive 50 yuan per month, and associate professors receive 40 yuan, which is not enough to buy a newspaper for the day." Under such a life, how can we talk about teaching morale? And how can we ask them to cultivate talents for the country?

Although the ingrained habit of Chinese intellectuals is "a gentleman remains steadfast in poverty" and "upholds righteousness and does not seek profit," after eight years of resistance against Japan and three years of civil war, in the midst of a family with wives and children crying for hunger and cold, university professors are also forced to haggle over the thickness of their salaries and lament the oppression of life. Those with weak wills have long since changed careers. Those who do not change careers often take on multiple jobs and salaries to supplement their income. Otherwise, they must rely on selling clothes and books, or borrowing and taking out loans, to maintain their family expenses. In this case, what reason do we have to demand the "spring breeze and timely rain" in today's universities and lecture halls, and what hope can we have for today's students to become the pillars of future society?

Even without talking about "education first" during the nation-building period, education is the foundation of the country and the key to governance. The problem of university teachers' salaries, and the news that professors in universities and colleges in this city are still discussing and appealing for improvements, is recorded almost every day in the newspaper. In addition, the decline in the academic standards of higher education and the dilapidated school equipment are all eye-catching and endless. We don't know if Minister Chen has seen it? We are even more worried that this situation may continue to develop and expand. I am afraid that before the threat of the Communist army's artillery fire, our university education will have already become nominal and merely have empty signboards!

Without raising professors' salaries and improving school equipment, it will not be possible to stabilize teaching life and boost teaching morale. Without stabilizing teaching life and boosting teaching morale, it will not only be the failure of the entire higher education, but also the greatest loss to the country and the permanent crisis of the nation. If the authorities today can bravely take responsibility and remedy the situation in time, it is still not too late. If they simply prevaricate and treat the symptoms rather than the root cause, then it would be tantamount to being willing to be a sinner to the country and the nation.

We have even more hope for professors across the country that eating simple meals and drinking from a gourd exemplifies the extraordinary qualities of Chinese scholars. At this time when salaries are about to be adjusted, we only hope that they will uphold the dignity of scholarship, the spirit of teaching without fatigue and tireless instruction, taking into consideration the students' desire to learn, and the expectations of countless families and society; display the great benevolence, wisdom, and courage of our ancient sages and sages, exert the utmost sincerity of human nature, participate in the great transformations of heaven and earth, respond to changes with composure, and teach with perseverance, boost research morale, and improve the academic atmosphere, so that the storm that pervades the country can be transformed into a peaceful spring!

### John Leighton Stuart Speaks in San Francisco: America Should Pay Attention to the Situation in China
### Father Mao Denounces "Wait-and-See Policy" in the Far East

[United Press, San Francisco, 22nd] John Leighton Stuart, Director of the China Branch of the Economic Cooperation Administration, returned to the country to report on his work. He said here on the 22nd: The Chinese will not become thorough Communists. The Chinese are hard-working and do not want to be restricted by other countries. Personally, the Chinese will never become Communists. At this time, so-called communism refers to a minority controlling the masses, like Moscow. But Americans should pay more attention to the situation in China. China is undergoing a great revolution, moving from feudalism to democracy. It is still a long way for China to catch up with the modern world.

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] Father Mao, a Chinese Catholic priest who recently arrived here from Nanjing, said on the 22nd: America's "wait-and-see policy" in the Far East is tantamount to a policy of "sitting idly by and waiting for China to die." He denounced the view, which is commonly held by Americans, that Mao Zedong may be China's Tito and lead the CCP to break away from Moscow's control, as a kind of "illusion." He also denounced the general concept, satirized as "the Chinese will be able to assimilate the Communist Party in the same way that they assimilated other invaders in the past," as a preposterous myth. Mao said: The Chinese people are now afraid that the United States will gradually recognize the government controlled by the Communist Party. He said: Policy statements from the United States could dispel this concern. He said: As of now, there are still fourteen provinces in China that are not under the control of the Communist Party.

### UN Mediation Achieves Great Success: Egypt-Israel Agreement Signed Today; Full Text of 5,000 Words Released Simultaneously; Israel-Jordan Talks Set to Begin Next Monday

Only after Sukarno and Hatta are reinstated can the provisional government be responsible for implementing any agreements they have made with the Dutch. This kind of negotiation by the Dutch is a delaying tactic, attempting to establish a Federal Republic of Indonesia and induce the Indonesian people to sign treaties to be bound by them.

### US Watches Situation in Northern Europe: Soviet Union May Send Troops into Finnish Territory; Suspects of Soviet Espionage Arrested in Stockholm

[Associated Press Washington 22nd Dispatch] With the tension in the Scandinavian Peninsula, US officials are closely watching the Soviet Union's relationship with Finland because any signs of Soviet action could upset the delicate balance on the flanks of the Cold War front. Some people eagerly hope that the Soviet Union will allow Finland to be natural in the current Scandinavian crisis, but no one dares to expect it to be certain.

The division of the peninsula is expected to be completed within the week, at which time Norway will formally announce its participation in the Atlantic Pact negotiations. Next, it will be Denmark's turn to decide its path. Denmark may lean towards the West, but with more reluctance than Norway. Finally, Sweden is in a semi-neutral isolated position west of the Cold War front. If the Soviet Union does not act, Finland may maintain a similar position to Sweden on the eastern side of the Cold War front. The Swedish Foreign Minister has repeatedly told the United States that once Sweden joins the Atlantic Treaty, the Soviet Union will immediately invoke the Soviet-Finnish Mutual Assistance Treaty and insist on sending troops into Finnish territory. The Soviet-Finnish treaty stipulates that the two governments should immediately consult each other in the event of aggression. Moscow has recently condemned the Atlantic Pact as an attempt by Western countries to invade the Soviet Union.

### Smith Denies Engaging in Black Market in Soviet Union

### Open Rift Between Italian Communists and the Vatican; Provocation Towards the Holy See

[United Press, Rome, 22nd] Italian Communist leader Palmiro Togliatti, in an article in the communist publication "New Life Weekly" entitled "God and the Atlantic Pact," attacked Pope Pius XII, stating that the Pope, during a special mass on the 3rd of this month, protested the life sentence of Hungarian Archbishop József Mindszenty, believing that the sins of God's enemies should be eradicated. The Pope then declared his support for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. All of this proves that the Pope wants to restore the "Holy Alliance" to deal with those liberated from capitalism and imperialism. The world should pay attention to this kind of imperialist behavior baptized with holy water. The Soviet Union needs peace, and the vast majority of people around the world also need peace. Warmongers feel increasingly without a foothold against this broad will and want to destroy atheism and eliminate those who hate God. According to the past policy of the Italian Communist Party, it avoided conflicts with the Holy See. This open rift is probably due to a policy change.

### Kailan Coal Pier Welcomes with Firecrackers; Successful Navigation Between Nationalist and Communist Areas; "Great Shanghai" Vessel Returns to Shanghai, Carrying 4,800 Tons of Coal; Crew Did Not Disembark During One and a Half Day Stay in Qinhuangdao

[Our Report] The "Great Shanghai" vessel, carrying five representatives from the Shanghai shipping industry and over 14,000 bags of flour to the Communist-controlled areas of North China, departed from Shanghai on the 12th of this month, arrived in Qinhuangdao on the 18th, loaded 4,800 tons of Kailan coal for the return voyage, and arrived back at the Kailan Coal pier in Yangshupu at 7 PM last night, completing the first commercial voyage between Nationalist and Communist areas. All 98 crew members, except for representatives Wei Wenhan and six others, including Captain Yu Huifang, who were specially permitted by the Chinese Communist side to disembark and go to Tianjin to discuss navigation matters, were prohibited from going ashore. Therefore, they only stayed in Qinhuangdao for 36 hours. Once the exchange and unloading of flour and coal were completed, they all returned to Shanghai on the original vessel. The vessel arrived at a position two nautical miles outside the Wusongkou at 4 PM yesterday. There, Director Xu Jinhuang of the Garrison Headquarters Water Police Inspection Office, together with Deputy Chief of Staff Zhou Chenglie of the Wusong Fortress Command, led more than 20 inspectors on a naval gunboat to board the vessel for inspection. After the inspection, the vessel sailed directly to the Kailan Coal pier. The Kailan Coal pier had not received goods for several months due to the impact of the war. All the workers, upon hearing that the "Great Shanghai" vessel brought news of navigation, set off firecrackers to welcome this first giant vessel to transport coal from North China to Shanghai this year. According to Acting Captain Huang Zhaofang of the vessel: The Chinese Communist side urgently needs food. Before a formal navigation agreement is reached, they agreed to exchange one ton of coal for three bags of flour. Therefore, after unloading this batch of coal, the vessel will continue to load flour and go to North China for exchange, following the "Tangshan" and "Nanchang" vessels. As for the actual situation in North China under Chinese Communist control, all the personnel on the vessel had no impression because they could not disembark under the supervision of armed soldiers at the pier. They only knew that Kailan Coal was still in operation and that the work efficiency of the dockworkers was the same as before.

Chinese Communist Personnel Boarded the Vessel for Inspection

During the vessel's one-and-a-half-day stay in Qinhuangdao, no warships or other vessels were seen at the pier. The atmosphere appeared particularly silent and tense. After the vessel docked, Chinese Communist political personnel boarded the vessel in batches to inspect each room, take roll calls, distribute newspapers and items, and individually inquire about the crew's views on the Chinese Communist Party. Some crew members complained that the food needed on the vessel was also delivered by Chinese Communist personnel, that their actions were excessively restricted, and requested that the "liberated" North China be introduced to the common people. The group of political personnel hesitated for a while and replied, "We are still in a period of military administration, so there may be many inconveniences. We can only express our apologies."

[Further News] The second vessel to head north, the Tangshan, is estimated to have also arrived in Qinhuangdao, but no telegram has been received.

### Postal Issues Resolved; Navigation Under Discussion

The postal issue has been resolved. On the next northbound vessel, mail will be allowed to be transported with the vessel. They will return south immediately after the navigation issue is resolved.

In addition to the more than 280 displaced students from Shandong Province temporarily residing at the Shandong Guild Hall, nearly 100 people were recently brought from Qingdao. Their meals are temporarily provided by the Municipal Relief Association, which sends a mobile porridge distribution truck to supply two meals a day. A few days ago, the truck drove to the Zhabei fire site to provide relief to the disaster victims, and the displaced students went without food for a day. The Municipal Relief Association's funding is tight, and it can only maintain the displaced students' meals for a short period of time. For days, they have repeatedly sent representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Education Bureau to petition, but local authorities have stated that they cannot be responsible for this long-term. The Ministry of Education has moved far away to Guangzhou. At this time when the staff of the Ministry of Education in Shanghai are experiencing financial difficulties and are at a loss, the disposal of displaced students has become a major problem for local authorities.

### Three Shandong Province Refugee Students Sentenced for Theft at the West Station

[Our Newspaper] Shandong Province refugee students Wei Fuxian, Wei Chuanyin, and Li Zhendong (only seventeen years old), currently studying at Hangzhou Second Joint Middle School, returned from Shanghai to Hangzhou on December 30th of last year. While waiting for the train at the Tai City West Railway Station during a crowded time, Wei Fuxian cut open the travel bag of passenger Wan Qiliang and together they stole 13,000 gold yuan. They were discovered by railway police, who transported the three individuals along with the stolen money to the district prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution based on the aforementioned facts. Yesterday, Judge Qian Songsen of the District Court presided over the trial. The three defendants, poorly dressed and gaunt-faced, all claimed that they had found the money on the ground and were wrongly accused. The court then consulted the report of the victim Wan at the railway police station. The court immediately rose and delivered the verdict: the three defendants, acting in collusion, committed theft at the station: each sentenced to three months imprisonment. Furthermore, the court proclaimed that the defendants were all educated youths who, due to being refugees, were forced by circumstances to commit a crime, which was considered pitiful and their sentences were reduced accordingly.

### Basketball Champion Six Times, Hualian, to Battle Encars Tonight

[Our Newspaper] The Hualian team, the basketball champion of this city, has swept all opponents in the national league, winning all five games and continuing to hold the championship title, which is not in question. In the first round, Hualian has two remaining games against Encars and Shanghai Police. The second round will begin on March 1st. Hualian has created an all-Chinese lineup and is confident of this. The league has been in progress for over a month. The first round for Group A1 and the women's group ended on the 27th. Only three games in Group A have been postponed and need to be rescheduled. Hualian will face Encars tonight. They are old rivals, and every encounter is sure to be a bloody battle. The Western players of Qing have many tricks, and their ambition to threaten the champion tonight is to be expected. Tickets are available in three denominations: 600, 300, and 150 yuan. Sales will begin at the City Gymnasium at 4:00 PM. The competition will start at 5:30 PM, with a total of three games. The schedule is as follows:

Hezhong vs. Jingji (Group A2B) 5:30 PM
Shanghai Police vs. Haiqing (Group A1) 6:00 PM
Hualian vs. Encars (Group A1) 7:30 PM

In Group A1, Hualian is a perennial winner. After being defeated by Huili, Encars has lost three times, and its hope for the championship is slim. However, the team has a long history in Shanghai and understands the methods of fighting against Chinese teams. Therefore, it is still a concern for Hualian. Kairoski is gradually recovering to normal, Begni is in excellent condition, and the veteran cunning of Chilibo Tuofu Nik and Ge Peng Qi Gu Fu is still strong. They had a friendly match with Hualian during the Lunar New Year, resulting in a 37-41 defeat. Today is a good opportunity for revenge. Hualian is the only undefeated team in Group A1. Haiqing, Mailinges, Huili, Renyu, and Peifeier have all surrendered. Tonight, with the momentum of five consecutive victories, they should be able to pass this test and maintain their undefeated record. The strengths of the two sides are not much different. At that time, the dragon and tiger will fight fiercely, and wonderful performances will emerge one after another.

In Group A2B, Hezhong will face Jingji. The former has many old friends in the team, such as Li Jiazhi, Li Peidong, and Dong Shaotang, who have been in the arena for a long time. Jingji is a newly emerging force. In the Chengyou Cup, they achieved brilliant results. In the preliminary round of this group, they defeated Wuxi Post and Telecommunications Team. Tonight, when they meet Hezhong for the first time, there will be a fierce battle.

Shanghai Police will face Haiqing. Shanghai Police is the transformed version of the Chengyou Cup champion Fangyou Team. This is their first time participating in the league, with four wins and one loss. Currently, their situation is second only to Hualian. If they can defeat the foreign soldiers tonight, then the final game of the first round against Hualian will be even more important. Haiqing is a US Navy team from Qingdao. They have reported to the committee and have made major changes to their lineup compared to the previous team. However, it is said that their strength is still strong, and they are not here for a friendly visit. The generals of Shanghai Police should be careful.

[Hualian] Ren Xiangcheng, Li Zhenzhong, Wu Chengzhang, Le Jiazhou, Fu Jinsheng, Bao Songyuan, Liu Fushan, Li Hanting, Zhang Liangxiong.

[Encars] Chilibo Tuo, Kairoski, Ge Peng Qi Gu Fu, Ao Chai Liao, Fu Nik, Fu Ke, Begni, Sha Sijin.

### Hotel Industry Raises Base Room Rates, Social Bureau Sends Personnel for Strict Investigation

[Our Newspaper] The calculation method for adjusting room rates in the hotel industry in this city, as approved by the city government, is to multiply the pre-war room rate (each yuan converted to 2.2 gold yuan) by the cost of living index to arrive at the current room rate. For those who opened before the war, the room rate can be verified by the account books. Those who opened during or after the war should refer to the pre-war room rates of similar hotels, and the guild will verify the base room rate and report it to the Social Bureau for processing. Since the implementation, the Social Bureau has repeatedly received reports that some hotels in the industry have raised the rates to a great extent in an attempt to profit. It has sent personnel to conduct a strict investigation and severely punish them. The bureau also hopes that citizens will report any discoveries at any time.

### Poor Children's Work-Study Institute Raises Operating Expenses, Holds Radio Appeal for Basic Donors

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Poor Children's Work-Study Institute on Jiangwan Xinshi Road in this city held a special program on Jindou Radio yesterday to raise operating expenses and daily necessities. Chairman Zhang Zhongyuan and Director Ding Fubao both went to the radio station to broadcast appeals. As a result, they received more than 600,000 gold yuan, 22 dan of rice, 12 silver dollars, and various items such as clothing, stationery, and banners. The Shanghai Poor Children's Work-Study Institute was established in 1949. The entire institute covers an area of 15 mu, including a self-cultivated small farm of 4 mu. It currently has 75 orphans. It combines education, care, and skills training to help them serve the society in the future. However, due to limited economic conditions, life is extremely difficult. There are currently only 20 thatched houses, and there is no water or electricity. The institute hopes to replace the thatched houses with two-story tiled houses, increase the number of students admitted, and add various light industries to supplement expenses and benefit the students by learning skills on-site. Since City Councilor Zhang Zhongyuan took office as the chairman of the institute, he has been determined to realize the above-mentioned hopes. A few days ago, Chairman Zhang held a board meeting at the Daguan Society. Honorary Director Pan Gongzhan, Director Ding Fubao, and many executive directors attended the meeting. It was resolved that, in order to solve the economic problems of the institute, a search for basic donors would be conducted, with 500 units per month and 10 yuan as the base number, to be collected monthly based on the cost of living index, so as to achieve a permanent solution. In addition, the institute is still short of 20,000 yuan for the monthly food expenses for purchasing rice. Honorary Director Pan Gongzhan generously donated on the spot, so the institute has no worries about rice for this month.

### Yarn Market Rebounds, Cotton Cloth Turns Firm

Yesterday, the yarn market rebounded. The morning opened with news that new economic measures were about to be announced. According to general speculation, their content would not have a significant impact on industry and commerce, so the general psychology changed. Moreover, the silver market was loose and flooded, and all parties had a strong appetite. The buying frenzy suddenly started, and all yarns soared.

42-count Blue Phoenix rose from 580,000 yuan to 650,000 yuan at closing, an increase of 80,000 yuan. 40-count Blue Phoenix rose by 35,000 yuan. 32-count Silver Moon initially opened at 440,000 yuan, once reaching as high as 500,000 yuan, and finally staying at the 500,000 yuan mark, an increase of 60,000 yuan.

21-count Double Horse appeared to open at a low of 360,000 yuan, reaching a high of 430,000 yuan midway, and slightly retreated to 415,000 yuan at noon closing, an increase of 80,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Next-day trading was at 425,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse rose by 55,000 yuan, ending at 370,000 yuan. Other yarns such as Tiannv and Jincheng also rose by about 15%. All grades below 16-count were firm.

The trend of cotton cloth showed slight progress. The silver market on the market turned loose, and the prices of items outside the circle rose, boosting people's confidence. Buyers had a slight interest in entering the market, but customer sales were still sluggish, so it was feared that the firm trend would not last.

Because Fangjian has still not started selling fine cloth recently, the chips on the market have become increasingly scarce, and trading has not been included in the right track. Although there were calls for opening outside the market, there were few transactions, presenting a situation of having a market but no goods. Yesterday, the initial call was 15,500 yuan, reaching as high as 16,000 yuan at noon, an increase of 800 yuan. Trumpet Boy fine cloth and B Fangjian fine cloth finally traded at 13,500 yuan each, an increase of about 600 yuan compared to the previous day. Other grades of fine cloth also showed a slight improvement.

Si Junzi Yuan Bi Ji opened at 13,100 yuan and then reached as high as 14,000 yuan. The noon closing was 13,900 yuan, a rise of 600 yuan. Golden Lotus Wonderful Dance Yuan Bi Ji also rose by 600 yuan. It was heard in the afternoon that black and red yarns had soared, and all cloths were firm again.

### Cotton Exchanged for Yarn: Labor Costs Severely Insufficient

Various Parties Request Constant Adjustments

The 32nd Standing Committee Meeting of the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Association was held yesterday. During the meeting, the application of using American aid cotton to exchange for yarn labor costs for factories 2, 3, and 5 was discussed. Originally, it barely covered the costs, but now, due to volatile prices and a sharp increase in the cost of living, the actual labor costs are severely insufficient. Furthermore, the consolidated tax is adjusted every half month, and if no adjustments are made, the burden will be unbearable. Therefore, a letter was sent to the Sixth District Association requesting a remedy and reasonable adjustments at any time. The association is currently discussing detailed technical measures to be submitted to the authorities for review and implementation.

### Flourishing of Chinese Stocks

A Total of Twenty-Two Varieties Opened

Two-Thirds Reached the Upper Limit

Reports indicate that the economic plan is not as severe as rumored, which does not hinder the stock market. Moreover, with the recovery of prices, stock prices are showing a boost. Furthermore, with abundant credit and a sharp drop in market interest rates, the stock market is flourishing even more. A total of twenty-two varieties opened. By noon, fourteen varieties had reached the upper limit, a general increase of up to twenty percent compared to the previous day. The overall stock market situation also showed some prosperity, with a total transaction volume reaching 2.766 billion shares. Among them, the state-owned Taiwan Sugar took the lead in hitting the limit, with demand far exceeding supply, accounting for 430 shares. Private stocks also saw increases. In the morning, Taiwan Sugar opened half a percent higher and rose to the limit in about ten minutes. Yung Shing Yarn also showed a sharp upward trend, with the morning price at 2.37 yuan, quickly surpassing 2.40 yuan and then consolidating slightly. Other stocks followed suit due to the strong support from banks. Chen's Lacquer and New Asia remained the leaders, continuing to rise to the limit. Around 11:30, New Rice, Jingfu Matches, Yong Gong, Hsin Yee, Da Tong, Sino-French, China Cement, Rong Feng, and Commercial Press all reached the limit. Yung Shing Yarn also reached the limit again due to fierce competition among peers. American Asia also briefly reached the limit. In the last half hour, all stocks maintained a firm upward trend, closing with a promising outlook.

### Loose Credit, Lower Interbank Lending Rates

Gold Public Bond Prices Rise Again

Foreign Exchange Certificates Break the 2,000 Barrier

Yesterday, the market credit remained loose. Various industries adopted a wait-and-see attitude due to the imminent announcement of the new economic plan, unsure of whether it would be beneficial or detrimental. The supply of funds was abundant, while demand was scarce, and the market interbank lending rate fluctuated between 40 and 50 yuan for overnight loans. Near noon, the market was flooded with excessive orders, and the phenomenon of forced lending was widespread.

After several days of tight cash, yesterday also saw a return to an ample situation. The amount of withdrawals from banks and financial institutions increased to over 10,000 yuan. The number of bank drafts decreased significantly, and the discount rate for large amounts in the market also decreased to about 0.02 yuan per yuan.

Yesterday, foreign exchange transfer certificates rose sharply again, opening at 1,920 yuan. Importers continuously purchased them, and designated banks competed to absorb them.

### Export Control Not Abolished

Improvement Measures Under Consideration

Recently, various industrial and commercial circles in the city have suggested to the authorities that the Import and Export Control Commission be abolished. Yesterday, Xie Renzhao, the secretary of the commission, told reporters that due to the current lack of foreign exchange in China, it is absolutely impossible to open up free import and export trade. This is not unique to China; nine out of ten countries in the world are unable to open up free trade. Under the current circumstances, China will never abolish the export control system, and therefore the Export Control Commission will not be abolished either. Currently, the commission has drafted a new method to facilitate the business development of importers and exporters, and has submitted it to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to be reviewed by relevant departments such as the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank. Many improvements have been made to the aspects of export control that importers and exporters were dissatisfied with in the past, and suggestions from the industrial and commercial sectors have also been adopted as much as possible to reduce the difficulties for importers and exporters.

### Reserve Ratio Unchanged, Interest Settlement Changed to Monthly

Regarding the issue of the deposit reserve ratio, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance have decided not to change it after consultation. However, in the past, interest was settled once every six months, but now it has been changed to once a month. The interest rate remains at 0.12 yuan per month, which is a disguised increase.

### Tea Market Firm and Stable

Discussions on Ningzhou black tea, which had been put on hold some days ago, continued actively yesterday, but the sellers continued to raise prices due to weak inventory and the recovery of foreign exchange transfer certificates, with asking prices reaching around 80,000 yuan per dan. However, buyers were only offering around 70,000 yuan per dan, and transactions remained deadlocked. The market atmosphere was quite solid. The supply and demand of other varieties were also imbalanced, but sentiment remained strong, and the situation remained firm amidst quietness.

### Lumber Stabilized

Recently, the price of fir has been firm in Fujian, and the Shanghai market price has reached 70 yuan yesterday. If calculated in foreign exchange, the cost of foreign pine is around 300 yuan. However, a large amount of privately sold goods (privately sold by a certain institution) have recently appeared on the market, causing the market price to plummet.

### Cargo Owners Eager to Sell, Rice Still Trending Down, Flour Stops Falling and Rises, Edible Oil Rises

Although prices of various commodities rose yesterday, the rice market still saw a squeeze and fall. Because the drop on the previous day was not significant, the rice market had already closed when other prices surged yesterday. When the market opened, many cargo owners were eager to sell, and white rice once fell by 500-600 yuan. Later, hearing that the black market gold price rose, it rebounded slightly. As a result, white rice traded at 10,100 yuan, a small squeeze of 400 yuan. Bo Dao, early rice, and indica rice each fell by 300-400 yuan. The Beishi market saw a small decrease of 400 yuan for japonica and indica rice, with early rice entering the 10,000 yuan mark. The registered arrivals yesterday totaled 6,613 shi in both markets.

Flour

Stopped falling and rose. The initial market was relatively stable, but as credit loosened, various parties made slight additions. However, with the implementation of the new economic plan imminent, most buyers adopted a wait-and-see attitude and dared not buy in large quantities. After the market closed, the Pudong gang bought in large quantities, and the Beibang also inquired. Sentiment turned bullish, and with the support of holders, the market rose sharply. The Bingchuan futures market rose to 4,480 yuan, and the old Che reached 4,800 yuan. Bran did not rise much. Fuxin's large package traded at 3,470 yuan today, and no transactions were seen after the market closed.

Miscellaneous Grains

The market turned firm, especially with soybeans surging due to the sharp rise in oil cakes, factory stomachs were concentrated, and Che beans rose sharply by more than 20%. Linhuai Pass quickly knocked on the 10,000 yuan mark, and Hankou Che Huang shouted 9,500 yuan. Raw peanuts rose by 10%, and red sorghum, corn, and tea beans all rose across the board. Only sesame turned dull in the local market, and the market fell back by 1,000 yuan. Hankou white sesame traded at 14,500 yuan.

Edible Oil

The market rose again. Due to loose credit and the rise in black market gold prices, it followed suit and rose. Soybean oil once surged past the 50,000 yuan mark, but fell back to 47,000 yuan at the close, a squeeze of 4,000 yuan. Vegetable oil also rose by 10%. Jiton's raw oil was 53,000 yuan, and Xiaoche sesame oil rose back to 47,000 yuan. Soybean cake also rose sharply, with Changzi cake at 4,800 yuan, a rise of more than 20%.
