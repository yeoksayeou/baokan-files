On the 11th, they infiltrated the vicinity of Zhitang, northwest of Taicang. North of Taicang, two divisions of the 28th Army and the 86th Division of the 29th Army, with over 20 artillery pieces, began attacking Taicang in multiple directions at 15:00 on the 12th. As of the time of this dispatch, the bandits have suffered heavy casualties, with corpses littering the fields, but they are still reinforcing and counterattacking.

(2) Over 2,000 bandits launched a fierce attack on the positions of a certain unit of the National Army northeast of Taicang at Lujia Ferry at 15:00 on the 12th. The defending troops immediately fought back bravely, and fierce fighting is still ongoing.

(3) A portion of the bandits, in coordination with local communists numbering about 500, infiltrated Qian Dun from Jiaozhi at 13:00 on the 12th. Local defending troops and local militia groups are strongly resisting them, and the battle situation is intense. Currently, the communication lines in the area have been disrupted due to damage.

(4) Over 1,000 bandits, at noon on the 12th, divided into groups and infiltrated the area west of Jinshan from Zhangjingwei and Fengjing, southeast of Jiashan. A certain unit of the defending troops resisted them, and after a fierce battle, the bandits retreated in disarray.

(5) In the afternoon of the 12th, over 1,000 bandits near Zhengyi, accompanied by ten-odd mules and horses, advanced westward towards Kunshan in dense formation. Our air force bombed them from the air, killing many bandits.

(6) The bandits advancing towards Shihutang (west of Songjiang) have been stopped near Bridge No. 46 and are being heavily annihilated.

[Central News Agency, This City Report] Communist forces are gradually approaching our army's positions on the periphery of Taicang and Kunshan today. The air force is providing support to the army units on the front lines outside of Shanghai all day long. Large groups of planes are bombing Communist troops in areas north of Taicang, such as Zhitang, Zhitang, and Shuangfeng Town, killing and wounding over a thousand Communist soldiers. Eight Communist heavy artillery vehicles, ten Communist trucks, and forty wooden boats were destroyed. Of the approximately four hundred Communist wooden boats traveling north and south on the canal along the Sujia Line, over a hundred were destroyed. Over thirty of the hundred-odd Communist cavalrymen north of Wuxing City were killed. A Communist team three kilometers northeast of Fengjing Town, near the railway, was bombed, resulting in over two hundred deaths.

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 12th] The spokesman for the Fuzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office met with reporters from the Central News Agency on the afternoon of the 12th, stating that the Shanghai reports on the 11th claiming that a part of the main Communist force had arrived in Xingtian, under the jurisdiction of Chongan County in northern Fujian, on the 10th were inaccurate. He stated that the situation in all counties in northern Fujian remains peaceful, and Pucheng has a large military force stationed there. Only local communists are creating disturbances between Chongan and Jianyang, damaging communication lines and disrupting contact.

[Central News Agency, This City Report] Military headquarters news at 11:00 AM on the 12th:

[This Newspaper, Hankou, 12th] There were no major engagements around Hankou today. Citizens did not hear gunfire, and people's hearts have calmed down. Many shops have reopened.

[Central News Agency, Hankou, 12th] Since yesterday (the 11th), when the National Army, in coordination with the air force and artillery, repelled the bandits facing them in the Wuhan defense, the entire day today has been quiet, with no contact between the two sides.

### Deng Wenyi Publishes Analysis of Recent War Situation, National Army Will Launch Severe Counterattack Against Bandits

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 12th] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Political Warfare Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, stated at a press conference on the 12th, "Analysis of the Recent War Situation": Since the Communist bandits disrupted peace and launched a large-scale attack, three weeks have passed. The military intentions of the Communist bandits are very clear, roughly divided into two aspects: one is that the three forces of Lin Biao, Liu Bocheng, and Chen Yi are advancing south across the Yangtze River in three routes. The other is that the three bandit armies of Nie Rongzhen, Xu Xiangqian, and Peng Dehuai are attacking the Northwest.

Currently, on the Yangtze River front, Chen Yi's bandit force, with about twelve armies, has gathered near Jinghang and Shanghai, seemingly actively preparing to attack Shanghai. Liu Bocheng's bandit force, with about nine armies, is advancing south from southern Anhui and has reached western Zhejiang and northeastern Jiangxi, echoing Chen's bandits and posing a threat to advance into Fujian and Jiangxi. Lin Biao's main force advancing south, with about six armies, is still between Jiujiang and Wuhan, north of the Yangtze River, and in the northwest Hubei area, waiting for the development of the situation in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River before launching an offensive towards Wuhan and its east and west.

Most of Nie's bandit force in the Northwest has entered Shanxi. After assisting in the capture of Taiyuan, they have recently joined with a part of Xu Xiangqian's bandit force to advance into Suiyuan and Shaanxi. Peng Dehuai's main force has pressed towards Guanzhong, seemingly preparing to launch an offensive towards Xi'an and the Wei River.

In the past, because the National Army sincerely sought peace, it did not actively prepare for war. Therefore, under the sudden general offensive of the Communist bandits, Taiyuan was forced to be abandoned, and Nanjing also made a strategic retreat. Although the National Army in those two places suffered considerable losses, the National Army still maintains its main force and is currently engaged in new deployments. At the appropriate time, it will launch a severe counterattack against the bandits. The war situation on both sides of the Yangtze River in the past week is roughly as follows:

(1) Shanghai Front: After Chen Yi's Communist bandits crossed the Yangtze River, they began to adopt an encirclement posture towards the Shanghai area. The bandits who crossed the river from the Jiangyin area were firmly resisted by the National Army in the Kunshan and Taicang areas. The bandit army repeatedly reinforced and attacked fiercely, but they were all repelled by the National Army in coordination with the air force. The bandit army on that line has suffered over 20,000 casualties. A part of the bandits circumventing in Jiashan, about 50,000, also suffered a head-on attack by the local garrisoned National Army, suffering heavy casualties. The 23rd Bandit Army suffered the most severe losses. With the mission accomplished, the National Army changed to defending the new defense line near Jiashan on the 6th and continued to strike at the invading bandits. Currently, the outer defenses of Shanghai are unusually solid, and the military strength is also very strong. The local authorities are urging citizens to store food, and the military and political authorities have decided to carry out a long-term defense. Strong troops of the National Army are arriving in Shanghai in a continuous stream, and the air force's sorties are dealing a major blow to the bandit army's movements and its transportation. Currently, the public sentiment in Shanghai is stable, and the sea and air routes to the outside world are as smooth as ever.

(2) Zhejiang-Jiangxi Front: Liu Bocheng's bandit army advanced directly towards the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Bojiang in southern Anhui. Changshan, Shangrao, Nancheng and other places have been occupied. Chen Geng's 4th Corps is being fiercely resisted by the reinforced troops of the National Army in the Dongxiang area. The National Army in Nanchang is also preparing to launch an active attack. A part of the bandit army is causing disturbances in Qianshan, attempting to infiltrate northern Fujian. At the same time, the bandits are deeply isolated, facing difficulties in supply, and their forces are dispersed, gradually experiencing difficulties.

(3) Central China Front: A part of the bandit army in northern Hubei is currently moving east, attempting to coordinate with the bandits advancing along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line. The 43rd Bandit Army is fleeing east from Guangji and Huangmei, and the 40th Bandit Army is south of Xiaogan. A part of it infiltrated and captured Hengdian on the 8th. Wuxue, at the junction of Hubei and Jiangxi, was infiltrated and captured by over a thousand of Zhang Tixue's local communist forces on the 7th. The National Army still has a large army holding Wuhan's three towns.

### Political Center of Jiangxi Moves to Ganxian

[Central News Agency, Ganzhou, 12th] After the provincial government moved south, Ganxian has become the political center. The heads of all provincial government agencies have arrived. The provincial party headquarters, the provincial security command, and the military police corps have all moved here. The Central Bank has also established an office here to prepare for resuming business. Ganxian originally had a population of less than 50,000, but now it has 60,000. The streets are as prosperous as before. However, the market refuses to use gold yuan coupons, and all transactions are mainly in silver dollars and silver dimes. Although the Fourth District Commissioner's Office issued a notice strictly prohibiting this, it has not been effective. The general public hopes that the silver dollar coupons will be realized soon, otherwise, government employees will be on the verge of desperation.

[Central News Agency, Ganzhou, 12th] After the provincial government moved to Ganxian, the first provincial affairs meeting was held here this morning. Chairman Fang Tian is on his way to Gan from Ji'an.

### US Far East Command Announces That Only Northeast China Still Has Japanese Troops

[United Press, Tokyo, 12th] A spokesman for the US Far East Command announced on the 12th that only Northeast China still has Japanese troops. In addition, there are only a few scattered elements. According to reports on the number of Japanese troops on Victory over Japan Day and the number of Japanese residents in Northeast China, there are still 60,000 people remaining in Northeast China. In Soviet-controlled areas such as Siberia, Sakhalin Island, and the Kuril Islands, 409,000 people have not been repatriated. After the end of the war, all 479,050 Japanese in Taiwan have been repatriated to their home country. 1,501,120 people have been repatriated from mainland China. Except for a few scattered elements, this is the total number of Japanese in China at the time of surrender. According to news from the Communist-controlled area of North China, some Japanese have joined the Communist army, but their number is small.

### Taiwan Provincial Assembly Decides Not to Advance Central Government Expenses

Requests Allocation of Stored Gold and Materials

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 12th] The Taiwan Provincial Assembly invited Taiwan financial and economic experts and all provincial assemblymen on the 9th and 11th, respectively, to hold a financial and economic issues symposium to discuss the "problem of stabilizing the value of the Taiwan dollar." Among them, there was a heated discussion on the matter of the Taiwan Provincial Government advancing expenses for central government agencies stationed in Taiwan. It was decided to "request the Central Government to approve the allocation of gold and materials stored in Taiwan to the Bank of Taiwan for use or sale to cover the expenses of various central government agencies stationed in Taiwan, without the need for the provincial treasury to advance funds, so as not to stimulate the expansion of the Taiwan dollar and affect people's livelihood." The assembly also convened a resident committee meeting on the 12th, which also discussed the matter in detail and unanimously decided to send a telegram to Acting President Li, Premier He Yingqin, President of the Control Yuan Yu Youren, President of the Legislative Yuan Tong Guanxian, and Minister of Finance Liu Gongyun, conveying the above opinions.

### Fujian Military and Public Transportation Is Increasingly Busy, Strengthening Transportation on the Fuzhou-Xiamen Road

In order to maintain the safety of vehicles on the Fuzhou-Xiamen Road, the Provincial Security Department has dispatched troops to mobilely suppress scattered bandits, striving to ensure that the entire line is unobstructed. As for the roads in northern Fujian, the road surface and bridges are also mostly unable to bear the burden. The Highway Bureau has sent personnel to Nanping to be responsible for handling reinforcement projects.

### Shanghai Businessmen Talk About: Wuxi's Various Aspects

[Central News Agency, This City Report] Since the fall of Wuxi, all sectors of this city and Wuxi natives in Shanghai have been extremely concerned about the current situation there. Yesterday, the reporter specifically visited businessmen who had recently come to Shanghai from Wuxi by private boat. According to them: Wuxi fell at midnight on April 23rd. The vanguard of the Communist army entered the city after midnight and the next morning. They looked very tired, as if they had come from a long trek, and most of them were sixteen or seventeen-year-old youths. The weapons they carried were rifles and hand grenades. Machine guns were also rare, and there were no heavy weapons such as artillery. After entering the city, because their strength was weak, the security in the city was still the responsibility of the people's self-defense corps. Everything was still peaceful, and there were no robberies. A week later, the Communist army took over the city defense, and the guns and ammunition of the self-defense corps were all confiscated. So far, only a few political workers have entered the city. After the Communist army entered the city, all newspapers were closed. First, the Communist Xinhua News Agency printed telegrams, then after taking over the Da Xi Bao and Min Bao, they published the Sunan Daily, which consisted of two large sheets, all of which were propaganda about the New Democracy and how the Communist army had received Pingjin and crossed the river, etc. Therefore, sales were sluggish. Household registration in the urban area has not yet been investigated, so entry and exit are not restricted. Even if traveling from Wuxi to Shanghai, it is not very difficult to pass through the Communist army's sentry lines along the way.

Wuxi has now been changed to a city. According to Communist personnel chatting with the people of Wuxi, they revealed that they had a lot of receiving work to do, and they didn't know where to start, because most of the receiving personnel were young people and lacked practical experience. Regarding industry, commerce, and finance, on the surface, the shops have all resumed business, but business is sluggish, and the bosses cannot pay salaries. Most of the employees are on unpaid leave. The factories have also resumed work, but the finished products cannot be exported and are mostly sold to enterprises designated by the Communist Party. After the Communist army entered the city, they announced that the Gold Yuan Coupon would be discontinued after May 13, but the shops refused to use it since the Communist army entered the city. The People's Bank is located in the Wuxi County Bank. Silver dollars are listed, the first day the price was 350 yuan for a large head, and the small head was 90% of the large head, and the Eagle Dragon Ocean was 80% of the large head, but there was no exchange. The black market price in the hands of silver dealers was as high as 40,500 yuan. The People's Bank automatically devalued the People's Currency the next day, raising the price of the large head to 450 yuan each, but the black market raised it to 600 yuan.

Entertainment venues are still open as usual, and speculative merchants have opened tea rooms in the city's park hotels and held tea dances, and some Communist soldiers also entered to sightsee. Most of the Communist soldiers are from northern Jiangsu and are interested in electric lights, radios, and movies. They also like rubber shoes and fountain pens. Also, after the Communist army officially took over Wuxi, the local communists from the four villages came to the city to claim credit in formation, but they were disarmed and ordered to reorganize, which greatly disappointed the local communists. Therefore, the four villages are now more peaceful than before, and many residents in the urban area have moved to the countryside, hearing that they are afraid of National Army planes bombing. Trains can pass from Wuxi to Suzhou and Zhenjiang, all of which are military vehicles, and there is no scheduled departure time. Only a few people take the train. None of the buildings inside or outside the city were damaged. The new Wuxi railway station building, built by the two railway bureaus, is also intact.

### The Taste of Being a "Liberated Teacher"

— He Yun

This is the personal experience of an elementary school teacher who was already exhausted on the escape route. He originally had no strength to escape, as mentioned in the article, but he finally had the heart to abandon his beloved wife and young children and escape. This article is the most urgent appeal he wanted to express after he safely arrived in Qingdao. We are publishing it for the readers.

After that "every family has spring water, every household has weeping willows", the Shandong provincial capital, known as the Little Jiangnan, was "liberated", we, a group of elementary and middle school teachers who "have no permanent property but have a constant heart", were also declared "liberated" in a situation where we had no power to escape. Under the slogan of "doing what one is familiar with" of the lenient policy, we became "again a bride". However, "liberated education" must be close to the masses, so we must also lead students to do various kinds of propaganda to the masses. Therefore, you teachers must be forced to say "the traitorous ×××". But when you are "cursing loudly", your listeners, the elders, are secretly making faces and cursing you "shameless" in their hearts. What exactly are you people? Under the spiritual sympathy, you have received this kind of silent condemnation. May I ask, what kind of taste do you feel in your conscience (if it has not been completely extinguished)?

"Liberated education" is "democratic", so everything must be decided by the students. For example, taking exams and reading books, it's just for reference, it doesn't matter; when you hear the sound of planes, you say enemy planes are coming and stop teaching. As a teacher, you can only comply with "public opinion" and say yes yes yes. If you don't know what's good for you and say half a no, you're guaranteed to be "reported" immediately as "ideologically stubborn, violating democracy, and immediately transferred to × place to relearn." May I ask, how should you deal with this kind of unlimited "democratic" style?

Once, when I was teaching arithmetic, a new student suddenly asked, "Teacher! Why is that 'ten' character called addition?" Such a lightning attack, if it weren't for having three handfuls of magical sand, I would have been knocked down from my horse. Fortunately, at that time, I had a flash of inspiration and asked back, "May I ask, what is your last name, student?" He said, "Zhao." Unexpectedly, I asked again, "Then why is your last name Zhao?" At this time, he stammered and was stumped by me. At that time, I was sure of winning and said slowly, "Then, is your last name Zhao because your father's last name is Zhao?" "Is your father's last name Zhao because your grandfather's last name was Zhao?" Pushing it up like this generation after generation, it proves that your last name Zhao is passed down from your ancestors. As for why the "ten" character is called addition, it is just like your last name Zhao, it is passed down from generation to generation by the person who invented this symbol in the past." So he sat down.

It is true that this may be due to the questions raised by some innocent children under the drive of their desire for knowledge, which do not necessarily contain any malice. However, every time they ask such questions, they clearly show a face full of sneers, especially if you are a teacher who has just been "liberated", you cannot withstand this series of questions, such as: "What is the Taihe Incident?" "What is the Sanwan Incident?" "Why did the teacher want to be a traitor in the past?" These kinds of questions that even the "political commissar" in their school cannot answer and make you both cry and laugh, if they are asked to your face, what taste will you feel?

### Guizhou Provincial Government and Council Decide to Restrict the Import of Cash

[Central News Agency, Guiyang, 11th] The Guizhou Provincial Government held a meeting of heads of various agencies yesterday. A detailed review was conducted on the current financial and monetary issues. It was decided to implement three important measures, which the provincial government ordered the Guiyang Municipal Government and the provincial capital police to strictly enforce: (1) The salaries of employees of various agencies in the province must be supplied with cash by the Central Bank. Except for the Central Bank's transportation of cash to the province, any agency, organization, or individual who transports cash to the province will have it confiscated upon discovery. (2) There is a shortage of silver coins in the province, and the circulation in the market is still insufficient. If banks and other financial institutions wish to engage in the business of silver dollar deposit and remittance, they must be able to raise 50,000 silver dollars from other provinces as a fund before they are allowed to operate. Otherwise, they will not be allowed. (3) Recently, checks and crossed checks issued by various banks in Guiyang City have often not been cashed, and they are sold at a large discount when used to purchase goods in the market. This is disrupting the financial system, and will be strictly prohibited from today.

### Gu Weijun Proposes to Acheson the Formation of an Asian League; We Are Determined to Fully Defend the Freedom of Our Nation and People

[United Press, Washington, 11th] China today called on the United States to initiate an Asian League, in accordance with the North Atlantic Treaty, to stop communism in the East. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun made this request to US Secretary of State Acheson during a 35-minute meeting. Afterwards, Gu told reporters that China hopes for a regional defense agreement to demonstrate that the concerns of freedom-loving countries are mutually consistent. Acheson expressed sympathetic acceptance of my request but did not make any promises. I told Acheson that the Chinese National Government is determined to do everything possible to defend the freedom of the nation and the freedom of the people. In response to reporters' questions, Gu said, I hope this decision can eliminate the United States' hesitation in adopting a decisive or concrete position on the China issue. Gu did not want to reveal the content of Acheson's conversation, only saying that Acheson mentioned President Truman's statement when he signed the North Atlantic Treaty last month. At that time, the President said that the US government's concern for democracy and freedom is not limited to Europe.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 11th] Ambassador Gu Weijun today asked the United States to provide active and concrete support for the National Government's anti-communist war in order to clear up the concerns and doubts of people in China and other Asian countries that the United States is indifferent to events in Asia. It is heard that Ambassador Gu had a half-hour meeting with Secretary of State Acheson, during which he requested that the United States issue a sympathetic statement to support the National Government and clearly define the moral and material assistance that can be provided to the National Government. After leaving the meeting, Gu told reporters: He explained to Acheson the recent developments in China and the National Government's determination to resist the communists. Gu also said: After the National Government itself made this anti-communist decision, we hope that this move will promote the United States to determine its position on the war in China. According to reports, during the Kuomintang-Communist peace talks, Acheson and other State Department officials stated that the United States would not provide further aid to China. Ambassador Gu added: In terms of concern for peace, China welcomes the North Atlantic Treaty, but there are also concerns because the United States and other signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty have not simultaneously committed to the maintenance of democracy and freedom in China and other important regions. This can be interpreted as the United States' concern for Asian affairs being far less than its concern for the Atlantic region. Even though US officials have repeatedly denied this, and considering the events currently happening in China, coupled with the lack of active US action towards China compared to Europe, Chinese people feel deep concern and doubt. Reporters asked him whether he strongly advocated that Asia should also have a defense treaty similar to the North Atlantic Treaty. Gu replied: Not exactly the same, but there are some indications that the United States is concerned about freedom issues around the world, without any distinction. Gu concluded: Unless the United States can reaffirm its interest, which is no less than that in the North Atlantic Treaty area, Asia and other parts of the world will definitely discuss whether the United States is indifferent to the rampant spread of communism outside the Atlantic Treaty area. Gu added: Acheson expressed great sympathy for his remarks.

### International Relief Organizations Greatly Reduced Activities in China; General Public Deeply Regrets

[Reuters, Guangzhou, 12th] Many relief organizations in China, whether international, American, or Chinese-led but supported by foreign countries, are discussing their future status. The larger ones, such as the ECA, have provided huge amounts of relief materials in China, and their organizations in China are also very large. While these organizations have benefited countless Chinese people, they will undoubtedly cease operations under the CCP regime. Other relief organizations are willing to continue operating in the CCP-controlled areas, but it remains to be seen whether they will be able to do so, pending the decision of the CCP authorities. The general public deeply regrets that their technical assistance to China will be cut short. The ECA is currently the largest foreign aid organization in China. To date, its aid to China has reached 240 million US dollars directly from foreign countries, and the aid funds obtained from the sale of cotton textiles have also reached 17 million US dollars. The items it supplies to China include rice, petroleum products, cotton, fertilizers, and medicines. The headquarters of the ECA China Mission has now moved from Shanghai to Guangzhou, and its staff, representing 27 nationalities, has also been greatly reduced. The number of American staff has been reduced to 56. Its work in various parts of China has been stopped since the CCP took over. Another American organization is the China Rural Reconstruction Joint Commission. It was established in Nanjing on October 1 last year and soon moved to Guangzhou. To date, it has spent 6.5 million US dollars in China. According to a resolution of the US Congress, this organization will not be allowed to work in the CCP-controlled areas. In addition, it is uncertain whether the World Health Organization, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, and the United Nations Children's Fund will be able to continue operating in the CCP-controlled areas. As for the four institutions under the Rehabilitation Affairs Administration of the Executive Yuan, such as the Fisheries Administration, although they are continuing the unfinished tasks of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), there is little certainty that they will be able to continue operating in the CCP-controlled areas.

### Regiment Commander of the 21st Gendarmerie Regiment in Fuzhou Assassinated by Subordinate Company Commander

[This newspaper, Fuzhou, 12th] Wang Hanzhi, regiment commander of the 21st Gendarmerie Regiment, was seriously injured by his subordinate, 9th Company Commander Li Shengwu, in an assassination attempt at 5:00 pm on the 11th.

### Special Article: Today's Shanghai Economic Problems

— Zhou Lixing

Shanghai was originally a city of all evils. Entering a wartime state might reduce the car consumption level of wealthy idlers, rectify bad habits of speculation and extravagance, and also lead to material shortages, worker unemployment, livelihood difficulties, and social unrest. Therefore, today's economic problems in Shanghai are inseparable from political, military, social, and livelihood issues. If economic problems cannot be fully addressed and properly resolved, the impact on society and people's livelihoods and the consequences for politics and the military are predictable. In peacetime, the evil forces of corruption, incompetence, and privileged selfishness are immense, and even wise men cannot compete with them. Now, we should seize this once-in-a-millennium opportunity, based on the factual needs of wartime, to drastically eliminate the evils of speculation, selfishness, and unreasonableness in the upper echelons of society, and prevent the dire consequences of livelihood difficulties at the lower levels. The former belongs to the realm of fiscal and financial measures, while the latter falls within the scope of livelihood economics. Here, I briefly describe what is urgently needed and can be achieved:

1.  Livelihood Economic Problems

Currently, coal and cotton from North China and the Jinpu Railway, and rice from the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the Taihu Lake area cannot come in. Even fish, piglets, vegetables, and firewood from the periphery of Shanghai are scarce or difficult to access due to the shrinking military zone. If this persists for a long time, the necessities of life for more than six million people will face a serious problem. Shanghai is already the outpost of Taiwan. In addition to the news that the Shanghai Municipal Government has requested assistance from the ECA, Taiwan also cannot shirk its responsibility for large-scale supply of coal and rice needed by Shanghai. From a military perspective, if methods can be found to allow rice, grains, vegetables, firewood from the counties east of the Taihu Lake, and fish from the Yangtze River estuary to flow in large quantities, the lives of people in the urban area will immediately feel easier.

Water and electricity should be immediately restricted to save coal. Gasoline can directly replace fuel, so vehicle use should be restricted immediately. More trams and buses can be used for transportation. Except for urgent military supplies, there is no need to use cars for transportation. Banquets should be stopped immediately, and all restaurants should be converted into public canteens to save vegetables, fish, and meat. Rice rations should be reduced. Except for soldiers and laborers, each person should be limited to one bowl of porridge and one bowl of rice.

It is currently the peak fishing season. If fishing can be protected and access facilitated, and if the scope of foodstuff, livestock, and vegetable purchases around Shanghai can be expanded, while economizing on consumption, large-scale cold storage and canning of food should be carried out to meet the needs of hot weather and military emergencies.

In addition to the military having a dedicated organization for overall planning of food supplies, public servants and the general public have unequal wealth and varying levels of storage. When rice becomes as expensive as pearls and firewood as cassia, rice-snatching riots are bound to occur. In addition to seeking supplies from Taiwan and abroad, the government should also conduct district-by-district surveys of private grain storage. When necessary, it should implement unified distribution to make up for shortages with surpluses. Multiple distribution points should also be established to avoid the queues for household rice purchases as seen today. This not only wastes people's time and energy but also creates the impression of a food shortage.

In the future, if the war intensifies and the scope shrinks, some factories will inevitably shut down, and entertainment venues will inevitably close. Short-term training should be given to band members and dancers, who should be organized into comfort and nursing teams to be deployed as needed to boost morale. At that time, the use of non-military and non-official vehicles can be restricted or even prohibited to open up a livelihood for laborers to transport goods by bicycle.

2.  Reform of Finance and Banking

A fixed price of currency is convenient for being a medium of exchange. The currency itself is not for human consumption. In years of war, the value of currency often changes with the political environment. Observing its changes, there is no fixed and fair standard. At the time of the victory of the War of Resistance, what standards were used to determine the ratio of the legal tender to the "reserve currency" and the paper currency issued by the Communist Party to the Gold Yuan? Is it accurate and fair? It is difficult to say. Whether paper or coins, the wider the circulation and the more goods there are, the higher the credit and value will be. Now that the scope has shrunk and materials are lacking, everyone believes that the paper currency is devalued. They do not know that even if the financial revenue and expenditure can be balanced, or if we completely regress to using coins, devaluation is still inevitable. Try standing in the Sahara with a load of jewelry, which is worthless because there is nothing to exchange it for. Since the value of currency changes due to the political environment, and the result of this change is devaluation, the government cannot bear the burden of printing, and the people cannot bear the loss. Investigating the reasons, it is due to the fixed price of currency on the face of the bill – yuan, jiao, and fen. When prices rise and currency devalues, larger denominations must be printed. If it is possible to issue "flexible unit coupons" in a revolutionary manner, printing only numbers such as one, ten, or one hundred without printing the price, and the unit of calculation is specified by the government by order, it can adapt to any political environment. Currency will never inflate, and the people will never suffer losses. Accounting will always be simple. For example, a "flexible unit coupon" with a unit of one is now hypothetically valued at 0.1 silver dollar in Gold Yuan. The government can order that the unit of calculation be 500,000 Gold Yuan. If the 0.1 silver dollar is worth 5 million Gold Yuan one day, the government can change the unit of calculation for the "flexible unit coupon" to 5 million Gold Yuan by order. If the political environment changes and 0.1 silver dollar is only worth 0.1 Gold Yuan, the unit of calculation will also change to 0.1 Gold Yuan. The exchange rate for foreign currency or the link to any other country's currency can also be announced through the unit of calculation without changing the name of the currency or reprinting new coupons with different denominations. The issuance does not need to increase, and people's savings will not be lost. If foreign trade can be controlled to prevent import surplus, then domestic prices will only be related to the unit of calculation and will not affect currency or people's livelihood. As for the name, it can be abbreviated as "flexible coupon," "unit coupon," or any other appropriate name. Whether it is theoretically sound and technically feasible, I hope scholars and experts at home and abroad will not hesitate to advise. However, I feel that we should study and create according to historical evolution and social needs. If the current monetary system of various countries in the world is not reformed, the third world war will inevitably encounter the difficulties we face today.

When the Gold Yuan was issued on August 19 last year, the stipulated capital for banks and firms was 1 million and 500,000. In less than three days, it was reduced by half. When the capital of banks and firms was inspected a month later, the Gold Yuan had devalued five times, equivalent to 50,000 and 25,000 silver dollars, and real estate could be used to offset it. Therefore, banks and firms, in addition to the signboard and facade, did not need to raise additional capital and relied solely on credit to engage in speculation. This was a major disaster for Shanghai. Although Mr. Jiang Jingguo strongly argued against it, the Ministry of Finance did not adopt it. The central government's policies were lenient, and the tigers could not be overthrown, so the economic supervision at that time could not be effective. Now, we can take advantage of the impending war, the reduced speculation, and the opportunity to transfer capital without much dispute, to increase the capital amount of banks and firms, revoke the licenses of those who do not meet the requirements, or order them to merge operations, which may reduce one-third or even half of the banks and firms. After the war, no new licenses will be issued, and their business scope will be strictly examined, so that other good financial measures can be slowly implemented.

In short, if our entire country, from top to bottom, can recognize the times, abandon personal relationships, sacrifice the small self, and take care of the people's livelihood, reform immediately, plan for governance with determination, and save the country and the people, it is not too late.

### Berlin Railway and Highway Traffic Open: German People Rejoice Madly; American and British Eastbound Trains Arrive Safely at Destination

[United Press Berlin, 12th] The Soviet blockade of Berlin ended at 12:01 AM (Berlin time, 7:01 AM Shanghai time) today. Military vehicles, cars, and jeeps began to speed back and forth on the highway between Helmstedt, on the border of the British and Soviet zones of Berlin. When the time limit for lifting the blockade arrived, the power plant in the Soviet sector of Berlin only provided minimal power, while the Western sector was brightly lit. This was the most joyful night in Berlin since the end of the war. Bars, cafes, and nightclubs were all open and full of customers. Allied pilots at the Western Berlin airport also held celebrations.

[Central News Agency Berlin, 12th] Berlin is preparing to celebrate the lifting of the blockade today. Schools are closed and most shops are closed. Thousands of civilians will gather in front of the West Berlin City Hall to listen to the celebrations of the military governors of the three Western powers. The West German Constitutional Assembly has sent a delegation to Berlin to participate in the celebration.

[Reuters Berlin, 12th] Allied airlift planes continued to land in Berlin every 90 seconds today, not stopping due to the resumption of ground traffic. The West Berlin City Council held a special meeting this morning to discuss the city's plans after the lifting of the blockade. When the British, American, and French governors arrived, the cheers of the citizens outside the venue thundered. Factories in the Soviet sector sounded their sirens in the afternoon to commemorate the "achievement of inter-zonal understanding." At the same time, a mass rally was held in East Berlin to express "the will of the Berlin citizens not to forget the unification of Berlin and Germany." The first train out of Berlin after the blockade was a German inter-zonal passenger train, which left Berlin at 1:30 PM. At the Soviet checkpoints on the borders of Berlin and East and West Germany, Soviet officials were smiling and amiably checking the documents of people and vehicles coming and going. Those who previously suspected that the Soviet Union would ultimately retain were relieved.

[Reuters Berlin, 12th] The first West German military train departed at 1:23 AM this morning and arrived at the Charlottenburg station in the British sector of Berlin at 5:30 AM, one hour earlier than scheduled. The train was pulled by a giant locomotive, covered with green branches. There were many British, American, and other Allied journalists on board, led by the British director in charge and Inglis, the director of the transportation department of the British and American joint zone. According to Inglis, the lifting of the blockade will open 12 railway lines between the British and American joint zones and the Soviet zone. In addition, inland water transport can carry at least 4,000 tons of goods to Berlin every day, and the volume of road transport is also considerable.

[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 12th] The first car after the lifting of the Berlin blockade drove into the city at 1:44 AM local time. The car was driven by Lentel, the manager of the United Press German branch. It is said that the trip was very smooth.

[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 12th] The first US military train from Frankfurt arrived in Berlin at 9:46 AM this morning. The first German international train left Hanover at 9:10 AM, taking the Weststedt route to Berlin.

[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 12th] The first Allied cargo train arrived in Berlin this afternoon, carrying 42 tons of coal from the Ruhr region.

### Ruhr Area Control Issue: Will be One of the Main Topics of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 11th] The Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference is scheduled to open in Paris on the 23rd. Western powers' German affairs experts have been busy exchanging views. Experts are scheduled to hold their first meeting next Monday. The participants will include US Ambassador-at-Large Jessup and State Department Advisor Bohlen. British Foreign Office expert Kirkbride-Béchard. Mr. Eyre will chair the French experts' delegation before returning home from the successful conference in Merle.

[Agence France-Presse Paris, 12th] The French Foreign Ministry today denied reports in some newspapers that France had asked Britain and the United States to agree to Soviet participation in the control of the Ruhr region's industry. The Foreign Ministry said that the French government has always abided by its agreements with Western countries on the control of the Ruhr region and has never made any new proposals. This issue will be discussed at the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers' Conference.

[Reuters Paris, 11th] Reliable sources say that at the Foreign Ministers' Conference opening in Paris on the 23rd of this month, France will propose allowing the Soviet Union to participate in the Allied control of the Ruhr region's coal and steel industry as one of the major concessions to the Soviet Union. When French Foreign Minister Bidault proposed this suggestion at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference two years ago, it was rejected by Bevin. When British Deputy Foreign Minister Kirkbride-Béchard comes to Paris this weekend, French officials will explain that the Soviet Union's participation in Ruhr control is a major concession worth paying for. The French diplomatic community believes that the Soviet Union attaches great importance to participating in Ruhr control, and at least hopes that the Soviet Union can send an observer to participate in the Ruhr industrial control organization. The French diplomatic community believes that in order to gain a foothold in the Ruhr control system, the Soviet Union may make surprising concessions at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is rumored that the Soviet Army General Staff has informed the Kremlin that they must learn about the actual situation in the Ruhr region. Some people in Paris have suggested that the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe establish a United Nations-led Ruhr Coal Bureau and Steel Bureau. This would allow the Soviet Union to send an observer to the Ruhr. The French diplomatic community expects that Britain will firmly oppose any suggestion to allow the Soviet Union to intervene in the Ruhr, but believes that the United States may support the French suggestion.

### East German Constitution in Drafting

[Reuters Berlin, 12th] East German leader and Chairman of the People's Council, Grotewohl, claimed yesterday that it is not difficult to find a compromise between the West German Constitution and the East German Constitution currently being drafted by the German People's Committee.

Representatives of the People's Congress will be elected this weekend, and then they will discuss the constitution drafted by the People's Committee, clause by clause. Grotewohl also said that the People's Committee he leads will not support a loose federation composed of East and West German states. Apart from this, the People's Committee is willing to support any compromise constitution that ensures the unification of Germany.

[Agence France-Presse Berlin, 11th] Chairman of the Bonn Constitutional Assembly, Adenauer, arrived here by plane this afternoon and told reporters that the Bonn Assembly will refuse to have contact with the so-called "People's Council" in the Eastern sector, because this People's Council does not have a democratic constitution. Adenauer also said that the new constitution will be announced within two weeks, and elections will be held immediately after the announcement, so that the government can begin to be established this summer.

### Standardization of Western European Naval Armaments

[Reuters London, 11th] Naval Minister Hall stated in the House of Lords' naval debate today that the British Navy Department plans to make the naval armaments of the British Navy reach the highest possible level of standardization with the navies of other Western European Union countries.

[Reuters London, 11th] New York Governor and former Republican presidential candidate Dewey told reporters here today that the resolution of the Berlin issue may be a trap, and he hopes that Western countries will pay close attention to whether there is indeed a trap when preparing to negotiate with the Soviet Union on the German issue. I believe that the resolution of the Berlin issue will raise immediate issues, as well as questions about Soviet motives. The severity of these issues is no less than that of the issues that have been resolved. Dewey and his wife arrived in Southampton last night aboard the Queen Mary and began their European tour.

### France-Belgium-Japan Trade Agreement: Will Be Signed in Tokyo Soon

### Reporter Calls on Government to Change Asian Policy

A Great Tragedy is Brewing in Southeast Asia

[United Press New York, 11th] Newsweek reporter Isaac said in a speech at the Reporters Guild today that another great tragedy is brewing in Southeast Asia. The United States is indifferent to Southeast Asia and has failed to understand the political changes there. During my work in the Pacific, I found that the people there are suspicious and distrustful of the United States, and even openly hostile. If the United States fails to change its current policies, Southeast Asia will inevitably fall into the arms of communism. The United States is poisoned by Europe-firstism and does not know that Western Europe has become the tail of the Asian continent. The Indonesian people are skeptical of the United States because the United States has always supported the Dutch colonial policy.

### The UN Political Committee to Begin Debate on the Disposition of Italian Colonies; Sub-Committee Approves Anglo-Italian Joint Proposal

[United Press, Lake Success, 12th] The UN Political Committee will make a final effort on the 12th to address the issue of the former Italian colonies. The Political Committee is set to begin debating the report from its subsidiary committee, which approved the joint Anglo-Italian proposal to resolve this almost intractable problem. Simultaneously, according to Arab sources, the delegations from the six Arab nations that walked out of the UN assembly on the 11th in protest of Israel's admission to the UN will all attend the Political Committee's debate. It remains uncertain whether the Anglo-Italian joint proposal can secure the necessary two-thirds majority for passage in the General Assembly.

### No Changes in Civilian Control of US Occupation Affairs in Japan

War Department Denies Military Officials Will Replace Civilian Staff

[United States Information Service, Washington, 11th] The US War Department has no plans to replace civilian officials in the Japanese occupation authority with military officers. The War Department's Civil Affairs Division issued this statement today, denying news reports from Tokyo. The report claimed that General MacArthur, Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers in the Far East, planned to replace civilian officials in Japan with military officers. The New York Times carried a dispatch from Tokyo on the 9th, stating that MacArthur was altering his policy regarding civilian governance. In response to inquiries from various newspapers, a spokesman for the Civil Affairs Division issued the above statement. It was pointed out that, while MacArthur has the authority to take such action, he has not indicated to the War Department that such a change is under consideration. The current plan for personnel in the occupation of Japan and Germany is to replace military personnel being transferred from the two countries with civilian staff wherever possible.

### President Truman Reaffirms Support for UN Institutions; Expresses Hope Other Nations Will Uphold Obligations Under the Charter

[United Press, Washington, 12th] President Truman stated on the 12th that the United States remains fully supportive of the United Nations, even though the US is disappointed with the security organization. Truman made the above statement in presenting to Congress a 303-page report on US participation in the United Nations in 1948.

The report was prepared by the State Department. Secretary of State Acheson stated in the preface, "The United States has no sound reason to lose faith in the United Nations," but at the same time, he pointed out, "The United States and other nations are deeply disappointed that the United Nations has not become a sufficient instrument for safeguarding peace, given the failure of some nations to uphold their obligations under the Charter." He stated that, due to the "inadequacy" of the world organization in security matters, the United States and other nations have had to conclude the Atlantic Treaty and take other steps outside the United Nations, but their goals are consistent with those of the United Nations.

Today's Situation Is Not What It Used to Be

Truman explained Acheson's report, saying, "If the United Nations has disappointed us in safeguarding security, if we have had to take supplementary measures to meet the real and potential threats to our security, it is not because the United States has not made a loyal effort to bring the United Nations to perfection. The world today is not the world we hoped for when the San Francisco Conference closed four years ago." But Truman emphasized that the United States still "supports the United Nations in all respects." He stated that the five permanent members of the Security Council, who possess the veto power, have a special obligation to uphold the Charter and "peacefully resolve their international disputes." "The fulfillment of these obligations," he said, "implies national self-restraint in international relations." He stated, "The United States recognized its Charter obligations in 1948, and "we will continue to recognize these obligations, and we have the right to demand that other nations recognize these obligations as well."

### Longtou and Jiuzhou Battle Fiercely; Compete for Democracy Cup Today

Jiuzhou and Longtou will clash in the Nanshi Democracy Cup today, starting at 5:00 PM. While this match is not the final, its practical importance is equivalent to a final. Looking at Longtou's past performance, they won 2-1 against Daxia, drew 2-2 with Zhongyi, and defeated Huaguang 2-0. Currently, they lead with the highest score of five points. If they can defeat Jiuzhou today, they still have two matches against Pan and Samsung, with only Samsung being a tough hurdle, requiring a hard fight. If Jiuzhou wins today, they will have two remaining matches against Pan and Zhongyi. Although Zhongyi is a local team in Nanshi, their strength is slightly weaker than Jiuzhou's. Jiuzhou may already have a 70% chance of winning the championship. If today's match ends in a draw, it would be equivalent to creating an opportunity for Zhongyi because Zhongyi beat Samsung 3-1 and drew with Longtou and Huaguang 2-2, also earning four points. Their remaining three matches are against Pan, Daxia, and Jiuzhou, and they can at least add four more points. In the opening match, Samsung suffered a 1-3 defeat to Zhongyi because Gao Baozheng and others were absent and they played with only ten players, currently ranking fourth with only three points. However, if Samsung can make a final effort and defeat Biguang and Longtou, the winner of the Democracy Cup is still a mystery.

After Gao Xiuqing registered with Longtou, he did not attend the first two matches, making people doubt whether Xiuqing could help Longtou. However, Xiuqing suddenly appeared in Longtou's third match against Huaguang, knowing that Huaguang was a difficult team to deal with and that without Xiuqing's presence, they would not be able to defeat the enemy. In that match, Longtou actually won by two goals, and Xiuqing's contribution cannot be denied. At the same time, Xiuqing's appearance in Longtou reveals their ambition to win the silver cup. The other day, the United Team challenged Sanwu. Apart from Meng Yiliang and Liu Tiyin, the rest of the Jiuzhou team in the United Team are unknown, which is precisely to conserve their strength in preparation for today's battle. Therefore, today will be a tough and all-out match. The referee is Wang Lin, and the linesmen are Ni Shiyao and Tan Rongsheng. To maintain order in the stadium, today's tickets are sold for one million yuan. The lineups for both sides are as follows:

Jiuzhou

Huang Shijie

Zhang Fenggang Zhang Yuanzhi Jiang Qing

Zhang Renyi Qian Changrong Fu Tang

Jin Lusheng Luo Shoufu Meng Yiliang Gu Yisa Xu Guoping Liu Tiyin

Longtou

Yan Chengkuan

Zheng Bingyi Li Chengxian

Wu Kaimin Wang Baoshan Shi Dafa

Wang Burong Jiang Kun Gao Xiuqing Zhang Jiliang Chen Qin Yao Qingsheng

### First Division Table Tennis League; Hualian Barely Beats You Yi

Three More Second Division Matches Continue Today

In the fourth Table Tennis League, Hualian faced You Yi in the first division at the Guohuo Table Tennis Room the day before. Neither side played with their full strength. In the first set, You Yi's Zhu Jinhai, although facing fierce attacks from Lu Wenliang, relied on his solid defense to prevent the opponent from succeeding. Lu was defeated by him. Jinhai's short hits in this match were excellent, making it difficult to win the first set. In the second set, You Yi sent Yu Chunrong to face Hualian's Li Zhen. Yu's blocks and short blocks near the net had excellent landing points; however, Li Zhen was an all-around player who calmly returned the shots with ease. Yu was unable to parry and lost in two straight sets. In the third set, Hualian's Yang Zhixiong fought hard against Zhu Zhongsun. Yang had the advantage in the first game, but ultimately lost 22-24. He was unable to hold on in the second game and retired. In the fourth set, You Yi's Qi Wenyuan was far from his opponent and lost 0-2 to Hualian captain Zhang Zhihong. In the final decisive set, Hualian's chopper Pan Rixi happened to meet You Yi's hitter Shen Airen. Pan chopped and Shen hit, and the battle was fierce. Shen won the first set, and the audience was worried for Pan. Unexpectedly, Shen was slightly careless in the second set, and Pan managed to tie the score. The third set was the crucial moment for both sides. Pan Rixi remained calm, and the balls he chopped had an unusual spin. Shen's continuous hits failed, and he also lost his strength and retreated in disappointment, losing 1-2. As a result, Hualian barely won 3-2, which can be said to be dangerous.

Among the Second Division matches, the battle between Yi Bu Yangbao and You Si was particularly fierce, with both sides being evenly matched. It was a pity that You Si's main player Dai Lingxu was defeated, changing the overall situation. In the end, Yangbao relied on captain Jin Zhaomin to defeat You Si veteran Fang Shirui in two straight sets, and the entire team won the final victory 3-2. The results of the two matches and the previous matches are recorded below:

Pingping refused to be outdone, and Song Lianxiang scored four points each with two free throws, tying the score. Zhi Ang and Jin Kang exchanged free throws for five, seven, and three ties. After that, Pingping became very active, scoring eight points. Hong Qi tried to catch up but failed. In the first half, Pingping led 15-13, a difference of one basket. In the second half, Pingping continued to be active, but Hong Qi also scored a lot, making it 19-20. Then they turned the situation around with 23-22. After this setback, Pingping's morale was greatly affected. Although they tied the score at 30, they were at the end of their rope. As a result, Hong Qi defeated Pingping 38-31.

Zhang Juncai scored back one point with a free throw. Ji Jing's Yang Xiasun scored one point and one free throw, making it 5-1. Jianle called a timeout. Tian Zhao and Gu Zhenji scored together, making it 10-3. Jin Kun and Zhang Yan scored successively, closing the gap to 7-10. But soon, Ji Jing gained new strength, and Zhang Tianxiang and others scored repeatedly, making it 18-8. Jianle sank again. Jin Kun and Zhang Yan made another effort, ending the first half at 12-18. After changing sides, Jianle tried to improve. The battle became a back-and-forth affair. At the eighth minute, Jianle's Zhang Yan injured his eye, and Zhou Jun replaced him. They once narrowed the gap to 22-24. Ji Jing replaced Zhang Rongzhi with Tian Zhaoqi, and Yang Xiasun scored two baskets. Huang Kegen added three points, making it 29-23. Jianle's Yan Ju and Jin San worked hard, making it 29-35, making some progress, but soon Ji Jing gained momentum again. Jianle could not resist and lost to Ji Jing 32-43.

### Authorities Plan to Replenish the City's Food Supply; Establish Food Procurement Offices in Suburban Areas; Specific Measures to Be Decided at Meeting This Morning

[Report from This Newspaper] In order to replenish the city's food supply, municipal authorities have decided to establish food procurement offices in suburban areas such as Nanxiang, Huangdu, Songjiang, Sijing, and Zhujiajiao, specializing in the procurement of food. Yesterday, the authorities decided on two basic principles after consultation: (1) Grain merchants will raise funds to purchase grain on their own. The grain obtained will be privately owned by the grain merchants, but the quantity must be reported to the government for registration for statistical purposes. (2) If the grain merchants are unable to raise sufficient funds, they may resell the purchased grain to the Food Emergency Procurement Committee, allowing them to obtain legitimate profits. The prices will be uniformly announced by the municipal government. Representatives from the municipal government, the Central Bank, the Food Emergency Procurement Committee, and the Grain Merchants Association will hold another meeting at the municipal government at 9:00 AM today to discuss and decide on the specific procurement measures.

During the luncheon, Chen delivered a sincere speech, stating: (1) In the current tense wartime situation, the municipal government's duty is to fully defend Shanghai. The main goal of current policy efforts is to reduce the suffering of citizens and strive for social order and stability. (2) While the defense war is one matter, the development and construction of Greater Shanghai must still be carried out with a long-term vision. (3) Political innovation and construction projects require the cooperation of scholars, experts, and all citizens. Therefore, it was decided to establish a municipal advisory group. The mayor sincerely invited the presidents of various universities to assist in selecting experts to participate in the research and design work of the advisory group, reviewing the gains and losses of current policies in order to rectify and innovate them at any time, and research and plan the construction of a new Shanghai. (4) The various responsible units of the municipal government will provide research materials as much as possible and humbly accept citizens' well-intentioned criticisms and suggestions.

### Police Department Thoroughly Investigates Illegal Rice Merchants; Punishes Severely According to Martial Law; Those with Serious Circumstances Will Be Subject to the Death Penalty

[Report from This Newspaper] Since the Municipal Police Department was ordered to strictly enforce martial law and executed five silver dollar vendors who disrupted financial order last week, the fluctuating silver dollar price has stabilized. However, the price of rice, which is related to the people's livelihood, has suddenly risen sharply in recent days. The door-to-door price has reached 50 million yuan per shi, equivalent to 12.5 silver dollars, which is more than double the price of last week. Given the current extraordinary period, the Police Department believes that some rice merchants are disregarding the law and are obviously engaging in price gouging, hoarding, and manipulation. Therefore, the Police Department dispatched personnel yesterday to conduct a thorough investigation. If solid evidence is found, they will be severely punished according to martial law. Those with serious circumstances will be subject to the death penalty.

### General Headquarters Formulates Provisional Measures for Remittances and Cash Transfers to Shanghai

In order to stabilize the city's finances, prevent speculative behavior, and stabilize prices, the Political Affairs Committee of the Jinghu Hang Garrison Headquarters has formulated provisional measures for remittances and cash transfers to Shanghai: (1) All remittances to Shanghai through the Central Bank exceeding 500 million Gold Yuan will be returned. For each remittance below 500 million, the total amount paid out each day will also be limited to 500 million yuan. Both the remitter and the recipient must fill in their real names and addresses. Remittances with the same name and address will be treated as one remittance. (2) For cash carried to Shanghai from other regions, each person must not carry more than 500 million Gold Yuan. If the excess is discovered, the excess portion will be handed over to the Central Bank for storage and issued a three-month fixed deposit certificate, which will be returned without interest upon maturity. (3) If government agencies and industrial and commercial enterprises in other regions must remit excess funds to Shanghai through the Central Bank or carry excess cash to Shanghai for legitimate purposes, they must first submit accurate supporting documents to the Political Affairs Committee of the General Headquarters for approval of the amount and issuance of a certificate, and then proceed with the remittance or transfer. The above measures will be implemented on the 16th of this month.

### Merged Public and Private Radio Stations; Only Fifteen Remain

[Report from This Newspaper] The radio broadcasting industry flourished in the city after the victory, with the establishment of as many as 30 public and private radio stations. Last year, in order to implement unified management, the authorities approved 12 KC for public radio stations and 15 KC for private radio stations (KC is the abbreviation for kilocycles, which refers to the broadcasting frequency). However, as the situation has become more urgent recently, the military authorities believe that it is necessary to strengthen the management of the broadcasting industry and ordered that the number of public and private radio stations be reduced by half. After discussions at various radio stations, some also believe that advertising customers have decreased and expenses have increased, making consolidation necessary. Therefore, it was decided that their original names would remain, but their operations would be merged into another radio station. After the city's radio stations adopted this cooperative broadcasting method, there are currently only six KC public radio stations and eight KC private radio stations, totaling only fifteen, in addition to Shanghai Radio Station.

The buying and selling distance for gold and silver exchange rates yesterday had closed to 3 yuan, with the lowest being 44 yuan and 47 yuan, the highest being 48 yuan and 51 yuan, and the average remaining between 45 yuan and 50 yuan. The reason for the disparity is nothing more than the variety of silver dollars. The usual transaction method is to calculate various versions of silver dollars on a 3-3-3 basis: 30% "big head" dollars, 30% "small head" dollars or "junk boat" dollars, and 30% miscellaneous foreign dollars. There was little change in gold and paper money exchange rates yesterday, with most firms doing 52 yuan for buying and 54 yuan for selling, while scalpers did 51 yuan and 53 yuan. The exchange rate for paper money and silver was as low as 8.3 yuan and 8.8 yuan, and as high as 8.8 yuan and 9.3 yuan. Ordinary firms still quoted 45 and 50 for silver jewelry in exchange for silver dollars.

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday's silver coin market remained weak, due to the lack of absorption by buyers. The price lacked upward momentum. 20-cent coins were quoted at 130,000 and 170,000. 10-cent coins were quoted at 60,000 and 80,000. 5-cent coins were quoted at 20,000 and 40,000, all without any differences.

### Rice Industry Comforts Police: Donates 4,000 Piculs of Rice

[Central News Agency] Since the police department's rice ration was cancelled in April, their livelihoods have been significantly affected. As the war situation intensifies, the police are responsible for maintaining law and order, enduring great hardship. It is reported that the Rice Merchants' Association has voluntarily donated 4,000 piculs of white rice to express their gratitude. It is also reported that 2,000 piculs of rice have already been delivered, and the remainder will be delivered within days.

The Tongchang Rice Shop at No. 540 Xizang Middle Road, the Tianchengtai Rice Shop at No. 581 Xizang Middle Road, and the Xieda Rice Shop on Chengdu South Road have jointly volunteered to donate 100 piculs of white rice to meet the police department's rice needs, in order to genuinely achieve military-civilian cooperation. Police Chief Mao Sen has sent letters of thanks to these shops for their understanding of righteousness.

### Market Stock Low, Sales Active; Rice Prices Continue to Rise

The problem of the rice market in the southern city has been resolved, trading has resumed, and prices have risen. Japonica rice is being uniformly quoted at 40 million. Due to the low stock and scarce supply, citizens are actively stocking up on grain, and sellers are raising prices. In the northern city market, white japonica is priced at 44 million yuan, and thin rice is priced the same as white japonica. The price of both has increased by 10%. Yangxian rice is priced at 43 million yuan, and milled xian rice is also approaching 40 million yuan. In the southern city market, white japonica is priced at 41 million yuan, and thin rice is priced at 42 million yuan, an increase of about 10%.

Grains

Formal trading has resumed, and prices are uniformly increasing due to the revitalized sales channels. The market situation has changed from weak to strong. Soybeans have increased by 2 million. Mung beans are selling very actively on the street. Pudong vegetable mung beans are priced at 28 million yuan. Sesame and red sorghum are not being quoted. Raw lotus seeds from Linhuai Pass are being quoted at 32 million yuan.

Flour

Yesterday's market was affected by the sharp rise in rice prices, and the upward trend became even more intense. Moreover, factories have not opened their books for days, and panic is gradually rising. Actual sales on the street are extremely smooth, and the market is seeing a surge in buying. New prices were repeatedly created at the beginning of the market. Lao Che once reached 11.5 million, but the market gave some back at high prices and settled at 11 million. Bingchuan 10 million.

Cooking Oil

Supply cannot meet demand, and transactions are extremely scarce. Market prices are rising sharply. Factory soybean oil closed in the afternoon at 130 million, a strong increase of about 20% compared to the previous day. Raw oil rose to 120 million. Raw rapeseed oil sellers raised prices sharply by 30-40% and also traded at 120 million. Cooked rapeseed oil rose by 10 million, while sesame oil and clear oil continued to surge.

### Allocating Food Rice to Relief Great Fire Victims

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai branch of the US Economic Cooperation Administration, in view of the unprecedented fire that occurred in the shantytowns of Changning District on the afternoon of the fourth of this month, which displaced 16,000 people, has allocated 450 piculs of food rice to the city government for free distribution to the victims for relief. Mayor Chen thanked the Administration for its righteousness and courage, on behalf of the victims of the district in a letter yesterday (the 12th) to the head of the Shanghai branch of the Administration, Louis, especially expressing his gratitude to Lai Bohan for his sympathy and relief.

### Cotton Yarn Bidding Slightly Firm; Cloth Market Remains Weak

Trading in the yarn market was still scarce yesterday, but due to the easing of credit, off-exchange prices showed a slight rebound, and bids also increased by about 10%. However, the sales were very sluggish. 42-count Blue Phoenix was at the edge of the 800 million mark, 21-count Double Horse was at the edge of the 500 million mark, and others were stable.

The cotton cloth market continued to be weak. Many yarn factories are issuing employees with fine cloth on hand as wages and salaries. The market is flooded with Longtou fine cloth from scattered merchants. Traffic to and from various places is still blocked, so in addition to sporadic transactions from single merchants, large-scale wholesale transactions by local merchants have come to a halt. Therefore, the shouts in the market are becoming scarce, and prices are hovering downward. Longtou fine cloth retreated from 17.4 million to 17 million, and Sijunzi serge opened at 18.6 million, then fell to 17.6 million, a drop of 800,000 compared to the previous day. Longtou B fine cloth was sold for 15.8 million, a drop of 400,000. Only Wufu fine cloth saw a slight increase, rebounding by 600,000 to close at 15.2 million. Santao and Dashuanglong fine cloth both closed at 15 million. Factory books mostly stood at the original level, with occasional reports of flat declines, and turnover was extremely rare.

### Bizarre Murder at the Zhaoshang Third Wharf: Female Corpse Found Lying in Camphor Wood Box, Neck Tied with Rope, Wounds on Hands

[Our Dispatch] At around 10:00 AM yesterday, a yellow camphor wood box was discovered next to Iron Gate No. 4 at the Zhaoshang Third Wharf (i.e., Jinliyuan Wharf) on Shangqiao Street, Zhongshan East Second Road. Sun Shouguan, a nearby cigarette vendor, reported it to Guard Constable Cui Yushan. The constable summoned Wharf Policeman Yang Sen to help carry the box into the office outside the iron gate. The resident guard Captain Lu, together with the Water Police Inspection Office, tried to open the box, and found a female corpse lying inside. She appeared to be in her thirties, with a round face and long hair. She was wearing a white vest on her upper body, red floral pants on her lower body, and light yellow socks. A hemp rope was tied around her neck, and there were wounds on both hands. The corpse was placed on a cotton mattress, with an old towel and blanket beside her. A blue Yin Dan Shi Lin cheongsam was covering her body. Her limbs were contracted. The guard constable immediately reported it to the local Yimiao Police Station. Police Chief Zhang Changqi personally, together with Criminal Division Chief Song Shaomei, led a number of policemen to the scene for investigation. Shortly after, the General Bureau was informed and the Chief of the Murder Division, Wu Futang, and police officers from the Photography Division arrived one after another. After photographing the box and the corpse, they transported the female corpse to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to await examination by the District Prosecutor's Office. Meanwhile, they are strictly arresting the murderer for investigation and prosecution. Afterwards, Chief Song said that the case likely occurred in a hotel. The rope around the neck clearly indicated strangulation. The time of death was at midnight, and the box corpse was moved to the location after the curfew was lifted at dawn. As for the wounds on the hands, they may have been caused by violent struggles when the attack happened. It is currently difficult to determine whether the case is a murder for money or related to a love affair.

### Recent Events of "Double Gun" Eighth Sister

--Hengyang Guest

If you remember the guerilla mother Zhao Laotai in Shandong, you will surely be reminded of "Double Gun" Huang Bamei, who was once a powerful figure in western Zhejiang. It seems that times have changed in the past three years, and it is difficult to find news about this female hero in newspapers and magazines. On my return trip from Hangzhou this time, I made a detour to Pinghu and, together with Chen, the deputy director of the local grain and food department, organized a Huang Bamei interview team. The members included central, provincial, and county-level personnel, as well as military personnel, newspaper reporters, photographers, and ladies, and on a sunny morning, we boarded a special car and set off towards Zhapu.

An Ideal Family

Zhapu has a small earthen city, said to have been built during the Ming Dynasty to defend against the Japanese pirates. It faces the sea and overlooks Huangshan, with beautiful mountains and clear waters, and pleasant scenery. Huang Bamei lives at No. 44 Zongguan Alley, east of the city. It is a two-courtyard, three-room bungalow combining Chinese and Western styles. Inside and outside the living room, there are also celebrity calligraphy and paintings, as well as photos presented by famous Chinese and foreign figures. The windows are bright and the tables are clean, elegant and solemn. Her husband, Xie Yousheng, is 56 years old this year, tall and with a kind attitude. During the Anti-Japanese War, he served as a battalion commander under her command and made great contributions. She originally had three sons and one daughter. The eldest son was killed by the Japanese gendarmerie, the second son, Zong'an, is a farmer, the third son, Zongguo, is currently studying at Hangzhou Zhongzheng Middle School, and her daughter, Ande, is studying at Zhapu Primary School. Although there are not many people in her family, she has many servants and two female secretaries. When we arrived, she was slightly unwell, so Miss Wang Shuying, the secretary, entertained us first. After a while, she and her husband also appeared before us. After Deputy Director Chen introduced us, we began to chat with each other. She spoke of fighting guerrilla warfare with great interest, laughing heartily from time to time. What impressed us the most was that every move of her and her husband was mutually respectful, free, happy, peaceful, and joyful, filling this ideal family.

Her Prestige Never Diminishes

Huang Bamei, also known as Baimei, courtesy name Baiqi, is 44 years old this year. She is short and stout, with a strong physique, sincere to others, generous in her actions, and especially good at talking. No one would believe that she was originally an illiterate female hero. In the past, she engaged in the salt business, traveling between Pinghu and Zhapu, and was keen on public welfare, and was deeply loved by the villagers. During the Anti-Japanese War, because of her contributions to the country, after the victory, she was honored as a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Council. Because of her far-reaching reputation, Chinese and foreign people came to visit her almost every day without interruption, so she built the Huangshan Reception Center on the top of Huangshan, specially to entertain guests. This time, we went on a tour of Huangshan, and she happily hired a car to go with us. That day happened to be the incense festival, and the pedestrians were like weaving. Wherever the road passed, the common people stood at attention and saluted, and only dispersed when her car was far away. It is said that these common people were mostly her former cadres. In addition to a part being placed in the county security police force and the township security class, the rest were either farming or doing business. If she gave an order, they could still be concentrated within an hour, which shows that her prestige is undiminished.

Cultivating the Second Generation

Because she felt the pain of being illiterate, after the victory, she invested solely in building a school building and founded Zhapu Complete Primary School. In order to further cultivate the seedlings of the next generation, she founded Haifeng Middle School the year before last (Haifeng is taken from her Haifeng Guerrilla). The teachers were part-time teachers from the local National Fisheries School. Every Monday, she must personally come to the school to give a spiritual speech. "Loyalty to the country and filial piety to the nation" is the theme of her speech, and it is also the goal of her life and work. Sometimes she also brings many books and stationery to distribute to poor students. She said: "The children all call me Mr. Huang, but I am not qualified to be their teacher. On the contrary, they can all read and write, but I am illiterate." He talked about the fact that 90% of the people in Zhapu are illiterate, and that he plans to use their spare time to establish public schools so that every out-of-school adult and woman has the opportunity

to study; she said with a very happy mood and very firmly: "From now on, among the girls under the age of seven in Zhapu, you will no longer find a second Huang Bamei who is illiterate."

She has indeed helped the local government directly and indirectly in many places, such as last winter, she mobilized the people to collectively complete the grain, urged her husband to take up the post of Zhapu Town Mayor, providing relief to refugees, building roads, etc., which were quite successful. She hopes that peace will come soon so that the people can have a chance to breathe. She said that she will hide in the forest springs with her husband and children for the rest of her years.

### Fuzhou City Kidnapping Case: Lover Conspires to Kidnap Wealthy Timber Merchant, Main Culprit Wu Jinrong Executed by Firing Squad, Female Accomplice Lin Lihua Sentenced to Five Years

On April 26th, at 6:00 PM, the Fuzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office executed a bandit. The bandit, Wu Jinrong, was arrested for the kidnapping of Jian'ou timber merchant Wang Runquan on November 15th of last year. Also arrested was the bandit's lover, Lin Lihua. After their capture, the Fuzhou Police Department transferred the two suspects to the Fujian Security Command for interrogation. The Command determined that the bandit was suspected of being a communist spy and transferred the case to the Fuzhou Special Criminal Court for trial. After the Special Criminal Court was ordered to disband, the Security Command continued to handle the case. The Command sentenced Wu Jinrong to death for kidnapping and demanding ransom, in accordance with the law. The accomplice, Lin Lihua, had her sentence reduced to five years of imprisonment. The case was then transferred to the Fuzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office for review, which upheld the original sentence.

At 5:30 PM, Lou Jingshou, the chief military judge of the Pacification Commissioner's Office's Military Law Department, brought Wu Jinrong for trial. The temporary court was set up at Banshanting on Pingshan Mountain. Chief Judge Lou presided over the trial, with the head of the General Affairs Section and the company commander of the guard company as assessors. Wu was escorted to the trial by eight armed guards, his hair unkempt and without a hat, wearing a white shirt and grass-green military trousers. Two guards supported him as he walked to the dock. The chief military judge asked his name and age before reading out his crimes and announcing that he was to be executed today. The condemned man listened with a pale face, vehemently proclaiming his innocence and detailing his crimes to the military judge, claiming his lover was the instigator. He requested a final meeting with his imprisoned lover, Lin Lihua, but the request was denied. The court asked if he had any last words. He requested pen and paper and quickly wrote a letter to his lover, Lin Lihua. The court gave him two slices of salted beef, a bottle of liquor, and two steamed buns. After a frenzied feast, he was escorted away from Pingshan, out of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and onto Beida Road, heading to the execution ground in the northern suburbs. At 6:00 PM, he arrived at the Longyaoqi execution ground and was shot. The first bullet missed a vital organ, and he did not die immediately. A second shot was fired, finally ending his life. The local headman was instructed to provide a coffin and bury Wu's body. The original announcement from the Fuzhou Pacification Commissioner's Office, No. 69, is recorded below. It is said that the female accomplice Lin Lihua, upon hearing the news in prison, was overcome with grief and sought to meet Wu before her release.

Indictment

"This case concerns the kidnapping and ransom of merchant Wang Runquan of Jianlong Timber Firm on Xiahang Road in this city. The perpetrators, Wu Jinrong and Lin Lihua, have been apprehended. After successive interrogations by the Security Command and this Commissioner's Office, it is clear that Lin Lihua is an accomplice and shall be sentenced to five years of imprisonment. Lin Gemin remains at large and will be dealt with separately upon capture. The perpetrator Wu Jinrong colluded with the fugitive Lin Gemin to commit kidnapping and demand ransom, which he confessed to without reservation. In accordance with Article 8, Paragraph 1, Section 9 of the Martial Law and Article 2, Section 9 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits, he is sentenced to the maximum penalty. The perpetrator will be brought forward today to verify his identity and be executed by firing squad as a warning. All military and civilians are hereby notified. Details are as follows: Bandit Wu Jinrong, male, age 27, from Jian'ou, Fujian Province, is to be executed by firing squad. April 26th, 38th year of the Republic of China, Director Zhu Shaoliang." The details of the case are recounted as follows:

Facts

The main culprit Wu Jinrong and the female accomplice Lin Lihua met when Wu was a teacher at Jian'ou Middle School. Wu had also taught at Jian'ou Pei Han Middle School for a time, and Hua's cousin, Lin Gemin, was a student at the school, so they were familiar. Wu planned to go to Nanjing for treatment of tuberculosis, and Hua was also in Fuzhou to avoid an arranged marriage. Wu, despite being married, still had an unresolved connection with Hua. After arriving in Fuzhou, Wu stayed at the Academy Affiliated Middle School dormitory at No. 3 Xueyuan Road, where he was visited by Lin Gemin and his sister. They often went out together. Hua initially resided at her uncle Zhou Jianzhen's house. Zhou Jianzhen also owned the Jianlong Timber Firm at No. 182 Shanghang Road. Wang Runquan, who was kidnapped, was in Fuzhou to sell timber and was staying at Zhou's house. Wu and Lin, both from Jian'ou, learned of Wang's wealth and conspired to extort money. With Hua's insider information, they changed their plans several times. On November 4th of last year, at 5:00 PM, Wu waited at the entrance of the Dongya Song Stage. Lin Gemin called Wang Runquan from the Dazhong Automobile Company on Zhongping Road. Once everything was arranged, Lin rushed to Xiaoqiaotou to await Hua's news. When Hua informed him that Wang had taken the bait and gone to the meeting, Wu's car arrived at Xiaoqiaotou at the same time. Wu signaled Lin to board the car. The car drove to Nanmendou. The driver asked Lin and Wu where they were going. Wu pointed towards Wushan Road and told him to drive. After passing the Xiaoliuxiang Road intersection by a dozen steps, he told the driver to stop. He immediately took Wang out of the car. After the car turned around and drove away, he forced Wang to a small path towards Xiaoliu Bay. After they went upstairs, he forced Wang to write and sign a check for 20 billion yuan. Afterwards, Lin and Wu moved the stairs to another location and slept downstairs. The next day, they sent a letter while Hua gathered information. Knowing that the Zhou family had received Wang's letter, they sent a stranger to Zhou Jianzhen on the 5th to collect the money. However, Wang did not have that much money at Zhou's place, and Zhou refused. Wu and Lin went upstairs again to talk to Wang. When Wu and Lin's threats were ineffective, they sent a letter directly to Zhou Jianzhen on the 6th, threatening him in the name of the "16th Column of the Chinese Communist Party," demanding that Zhou pay 20 billion yuan on Wang's behalf. They spoke with the language of communists, spreading alarmist rumors, and threatening Zhou as well. As soon as they finished speaking, the landlord, Lin Zhengshi, suddenly came upstairs. Because there were farm tools upstairs, Zhengshi came up to retrieve them. Seeing Wang, he asked Wu and Lin who he was. Wu said he was a sick friend who was staying there temporarily. He immediately escorted Wang downstairs. After Zhengshi retrieved the tools, they brought him back upstairs and placed the stairs back. After Wang returned upstairs, he accidentally discovered a small door when he moved the farm tools. He quickly covered it with other objects to use for escape. After sitting there for a long time, he heard loud snoring downstairs. Wang got up and intentionally made noise, testing whether they were asleep. In the past, every time there was noise upstairs, they would cough or make the sound of a gun being cocked. Wang walked around, but the snoring continued. Still unsure, Wang raised his hand and threw a tile from the roof, but there was still no movement. Still, Wang did not dare to move rashly. But he opened the small door and felt around, discovering a rafter on the corner of the door that he could use as a foothold. Two steps away, he saw a ladder leaning against the wall. Wang, overjoyed to find a way out, waited for dawn. At dawn, he heard the sound of brushing teeth downstairs, followed by footsteps, and then silence. Wang decided to escape. He stepped out of the small door, climbed down the ladder carefully, and saw no one in the hall. He quickly ran to the front door and encountered no one. At Nanmendou, he hired a car and left on his own. Wang escaped and immediately called the police, requesting protection. The next day, Wu sent someone with the check to the Zhou family to collect the money. Wang and Zhou planned to detain him, but Hua's insider, in the blink of an eye, warned the messenger, who escaped. After Lin Lihua was arrested, because of her deep love for Wu Jinrong, she claimed to only know Wu, but their relationship was superficial. She claimed Wu had gone to Nanjing and was not in Fuzhou. She also tried to mislead the investigation. However, she vehemently denied being the "insider" in this case. She also used the name "Liu Yukang" in place of Wu Jinrong's. After extensive interrogation by the police department, and after finding a note on Lihua's person that read: "Lihua: You said you would go to the movies next Monday night, but I can't wait. How about going together on Sunday (tomorrow)? I hope you will give me an answer. Goodbye! Sincerely, Zhiming, Saturday afternoon," they determined that the person who wrote this note must be one of the main culprits. After questioning all those involved, they learned that the main culprit was Wu Jinrong, currently residing at No. 3 Xueyuan Road, Qiaotouweiban, Guanglufang. On the afternoon of November 13th, Director Li Yiyun sent Ma Zuhui to lead detectives to arrest him. After arriving, they discovered Wu was not at home, but his luggage was there. They also learned that Wu was about to leave Fujian. This was a crucial moment. Ma quickly consulted with those lying in wait. Detectives were stationed nearby, and a white paper was posted on the door. As soon as the main culprit returned home, those lying in wait would tear off the white paper as a signal. After waiting for two hours, at about 3:00 PM, a young man in a Ma Gong's military uniform and wearing a military officer's commemorative badge arrived from Guanglufang. After getting out of the car, he hurried into the house. The white paper on the door was immediately torn off. Detectives rushed forward and arrested him, sending him to the Fuzhou Police Department. After interrogation, Wu confessed to the kidnapping without hesitation, but refused to reveal Lin's whereabouts.

### A Glimpse of the Northwest

— Translated by Yang Guangjie

Beyond the coastal provinces, China also has a vast area - Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunnan. These provinces, together with Xinjiang, include a population of about 100 million. Among these 100 million people are Han, Hui, Tibetan, Mongolian, and other ethnic groups.

As the center of these provinces, Lanzhou, Gansu, is full of local flavor. All the houses are built entirely of earth, and even the roof tiles are made of mud. The city's streets are similar to those of other Chinese cities, a center of trade, densely packed with vendors selling gorgeous Xinjiang carpets, Turkish skullcaps, Shanghai cotton fabrics, and all sorts of goods. The only means of transportation here is the mule-drawn four-wheeled cart. Not to mention cars, even vehicles with pneumatic tires are rarely seen. Not far outside the city is the Yellow River, with waterwheels built along the banks, but these waterwheels do not turn until the spring floods. These waterwheels are the only tool for irrigating the fields. The villages along the coast are very poor, and even in winter, the children have no clothes to wear.

The general manager of Gansu Province Highway, Hu Huafu, a Swede who has been doing business in China for many years, believes that the CCP will not invade the Northwest. What about the Chinese people? They also do not want a communist society in China.

Based on religious relations, the Hui people are the most opposed to the Communist Party. They are willing to continue fighting the CCP. Although they are not large in number, they all control military power and govern the provinces of Qinghai and Ningxia, and part of Xinjiang.

### Impoverished Women's Maternity Assistance Faces Suspension: Readers Launch Silver Dollar Donation Campaign; Deep Appreciation for Suggestions from Chang Le Ju Resident; Appeals to All Sectors for Generous Donations

To the esteemed gentlemen of the Shen Bao service column: I am a long-time reader of your esteemed newspaper and deeply admire the efforts and significant achievements of your column in serving the community. In particular, the impoverished women's maternity assistance program, in cooperation with the city's major hospitals, benefits the impoverished and promotes new methods of childbirth, ensuring the safety of mothers and infants, contributing to the nation, and holding profound significance! My heart is willing, but my resources are limited. Although I have made occasional donations in the past, the amount has always been very small and insignificant.

Yesterday, I read the urgent appeal published in your column and learned that this charitable cause is facing suspension due to insufficient donations, which made me worried! I believe that with the high prices and increasing difficulties in life today, the need for assistance to impoverished mothers is even more urgent. Although many wealthy and powerful families have already fled, there are still many substantial merchants who have remained in Shanghai to continue their businesses. Compassion exists in everyone's heart, and I believe that after your esteemed newspaper publishes this urgent appeal, donations will flow in. However, with the daily depreciation of currency, the accumulation of small contributions cannot solve the problem! I would like to offer a humble suggestion to your esteemed newspaper. If your esteemed newspaper can launch a silver dollar donation campaign, this meaningful charitable cause can continue to unfold and will not be interrupted. A silver dollar is currently priced at 4 million yuan. Although ordinary people may not have the surplus to donate, there are certainly many substantial merchants in Shanghai who are able to donate hundreds or thousands of silver dollars. Even the generally stable readers of your esteemed newspaper can strive to donate one silver dollar. I believe that there are more than 10,000 such people. Given the high reputation of your esteemed newspaper, a call to action will certainly be heeded by readers who support your esteemed newspaper, who will not be reluctant to donate this one dollar and allow the maternity assistance program to come to an end. I am now making an effort to donate one silver coin to express my sincerity and hope to inspire others to show warm sympathy from all walks of life, respond to the call, and complete the charitable undertaking. I offer my sincere prayers! I respectfully make this announcement and wish you well.

To whom it may concern: I have purchased two five-pound cans of Jinshan brand milk powder from the street, and upon opening them, they were both of poor quality, containing wheat flour and various unclean powders. If these inferior milk powders are not carefully identified, they can cause great harm to the health of infants. I am writing to your column specifically to expose this, so that buyers can pay attention and avoid being fooled. I am also providing the results of my research after being deceived, as follows:

(1) Most counterfeit products do not have a spoon inside the can.

(2) The red Golden State oval trademark on the can must be in the middle, and the top and bottom points of the trademark must be about one inch from the lid and bottom. Now, because the milk powder has been taken out and the teeth removed, the distance at the top is less than one inch. This must be because it was opened and then re-covered.

(3) When purchasing, it is best to open the entire lid on the spot to distinguish the genuine from the fake. Even if only a small opening of one inch is allowed, it is not to be trusted, because the milk powder may be genuine on the top and bottom, but the powder in the middle may be adulterated.

Finally, I hope that the managers and experts will pay attention and send personnel to investigate everywhere, so that they can report to the police and thoroughly investigate these unscrupulous merchants who use all means!

Sincerely, Wang Zhai, a victim of fraud, May 9th

### Ms. Jiang Seeks Employment

To the esteemed gentlemen: I deeply admire your column for seeking the welfare of the people. I graduated from the Obstetrics Department of Keio University's Medical School in Tokyo. After returning to China, I served as the director of obstetrics at the Ministry of Transportation's Hospital in Ping. I then practiced independently in Tianjin. I recently came to Shanghai and wish to find a position in the medical field. As I have been unemployed for a long time, I feel very bored. I respectfully request your column to help me find a position, whether it is in a municipal hospital, military hospital, or charitable hospital, it is all the same to me, and I do not care about the salary. If you could help me, I would be eternally grateful! I offer my best wishes. Jiang Zhiyi. Contact: c/o Mr. Liu Zhaoxiang, No. 1195 Fuxing Middle Road, Shanghai
