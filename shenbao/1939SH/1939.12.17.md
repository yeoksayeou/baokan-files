Editorial

### Japanese Aggression and the Opening of the Yangtze River

Yesterday's Associated Press dispatch from Tokyo stated:

According to a statement made today by a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura and U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew did not discuss the issue of opening the Yangtze River. The Yangtze River is still closed due to military necessity, and the timing for opening it to ships of third countries is not yet ripe. This statement by the Japanese spokesman was in response to questions from foreign reporters after the Japanese "Kokumin Shimbun" carried a report that the Yangtze River might be opened in the near future. It is noted that opening the Yangtze River was originally the proposal of Japanese House of Peers member Tsugiyoshi Debuchi. Yesterday, the "Kokumin Shimbun" speculated on Debuchi's proposal, believing that the time was approaching, but at the same time adding criticism, roughly saying: The general public in Japan is strongly opposed to opening the Yangtze River, and allowing ships of various countries to freely navigate China's inland rivers not only undermines China's administrative integrity but also contradicts the basic principles and customs of international law. Furthermore, this kind of navigation would naturally greatly benefit the economies of third countries but would greatly harm China's political and military interests. In addition, unconditional opening would cause Japan's various efforts since the Sino-Japanese War to be completely washed away and all its achievements to be abandoned. Therefore, in order to establish a "New Order in East Asia," China's inland rivers should never be allowed to be navigated by third countries, because once opened, the Yangtze River shipping industry will inevitably be regained by the British.

The "Kokumin Shimbun" both recognizes that opening the Yangtze River is "strongly opposed" by the general public in Japan and feels that the timing for opening is "approaching." Its argument is bizarre and difficult to justify, and it is not worth exploring in depth. However, its opposition to opening the Yangtze River is based on reasons such as "China's administrative integrity" and "international law," which is enough to be scorned by those in the know and does not require any further analysis. However, its conclusion, that unconditional opening will cause Japan to abandon all its achievements and that the Yangtze River shipping industry will be regained by the British, is tantamount to a self-confession, revealing all its inner thoughts.

Regarding the issue of opening the Yangtze River, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and other countries with vested interests have repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese authorities, to the point of exhaustion, while the Japanese side has consistently used excuses to procrastinate. When the Chinese army held Wuhan, the Japanese side promised to various countries that "the Yangtze River would be open for free navigation once Hankou fell." Subsequently, they immediately went back on their word, saying that due to the ongoing war, the Yangtze River was full of mines, making navigation dangerous. However, in reality, navigation markers have long been laid out on the Yangtze River from Shanghai to Hankou, and warships of various countries and transport ships of over 6,000 tons can travel smoothly without hindrance. Moreover, Japanese companies, the Jingqing Company and the Dalian Stock Company, which monopolize shipping profits, have openly advertised, soliciting customers, saying that they can "guarantee absolute safety along the way." Therefore, the claim of dangerous navigation can be refuted without even attacking it. Under coercion, merchants from third countries have no choice but to rely on the Japanese side for even the crumbs of the shipping below Jiangyin. And even this small amount is subject to various forms of oppression and exploitation by both the Japanese and puppet authorities. For example, starting on June 1st of this year, the military, under the pretext of restricting navigation during the military period, hindered foreign ships. The foreign merchants and shipping industry in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have suffered greatly as a result. Furthermore, the Japanese and puppet authorities are planning to carry out foreign ship registration in order to abuse their power. The Yangtze River is the major artery of China's national economy. If the issue of full-line navigation is not resolved one day, foreign merchants and the shipping industry in China will inevitably perish together. Once the Japanese side's control arrangements are fully completed and the Yangtze River basin is controlled by the Japanese alone, even if a formal opening is made, how can foreign merchants be revived? What impact will this have on the legitimate commercial rights and interests of various countries in China? Just look at the foreign exchange management and monopoly system implemented by the Japanese side in the occupied areas, proceeding step by step and making every effort. Regarding the Yangtze River, such as the organization of the "Central China Revitalization Company" and the "Shanghai Inland Water Transport Company," they control agricultural products in Central China and prohibit the export of agricultural products from the Yangtze River Delta to Shanghai. All of this is a manifestation of their ambition to monopolize the industry.

Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War (1936), the volume of foreign trade in the Yangtze River basin accounted for more than 60% of the country's total trade. In 1937, it decreased to 55%, and in 1938, it fell to 28.95%. The biggest reason for this was the shipping blockade. Looking at the shipping industry, before the Sino-Japanese War, China and the United Kingdom were the strongest, with Japan ranking third. Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War and the blockade of the Yangtze River, Japanese ships have completely disappeared. Now, taking advantage of the opportunity, they have risen sharply, viewing the Yangtze River as a forbidden fruit and third countries as unnecessary burdens. Their intention is that unless third countries kneel before them, they will not share even a sliver of profit. And for the sake of third countries, it is necessary to make a determined decision to make Japan easily submit. It is still remembered that on November 7th of last year, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France jointly made a serious protest to the Japanese government regarding the issue of Yangtze River navigation, but as a result, the Japanese side still used empty words to prevaricate. It is no wonder that they are "seeking the skin from a tiger." As the spokesman of the Foreign Ministry said yesterday, the benefits of Yangtze River navigation will be regained by the British, and the British have the most vested interests in this issue. They should not remain helpless for a long time and only rely on the success of China's resistance against Japan. Taking advantage of the difficult situation in Europe, they should not have too much to do in the Far East, and should provide China's resistance against Japan with as much practical assistance as possible. The Japanese people's words are nothing more than a case of deceiving oneself. In the eyes of the Japanese today, there is no such thing as the United Kingdom. The claim of preventing the United Kingdom is a false statement. Monopolization is the main reason for their aggression. If they cannot fulfill their dream of monopolization, then the large-scale use of troops is in vain. However, after fighting for two and a half years, they have no hope of defeating China and are wary of the United States. Therefore, they are using political and economic offensives to compensate for the inadequacy of their military force. By maintaining a superficial relationship with the United States, they claim that they will still respect the rights and interests of the United States. In fact, they insist on blockading the Yangtze River to achieve their private monopoly and verbally respect the rights and interests of other countries in order to hide their expulsion. This is the fundamental contradiction in Japan's handling of the so-called "China Incident" and the reason why Japan cannot gain the understanding of the United States. They reject the United States but still have to resort to sweet talk and deception, so they use the excuse of preventing the United Kingdom. Where there is a contradiction in fact, how can Japan achieve its desire for a quick resolution, and how can it achieve its ambition of monopolization!

### The United States Morally Prohibits the Sale of Molybdenum and Aluminum to Japan, the Soviet Union, and Germany Because They Are Necessary Raw Materials for Manufacturing Aircraft; The State Department Notifies Exporters to Stop Selling

Washington: The State Department recently issued a notice to merchants producing and exporting molybdenum and aluminum, stating that these metals are necessary raw materials for manufacturing aircraft. In accordance with President Roosevelt's remarks made on the 2nd of this month, they should no longer be sold to countries that use aircraft to bomb ordinary people. If contracts have already been signed and cannot be canceled, the contents should be sent to the State Department for reference. Knowledgeable sources here recently commented that this is a moral ban on exports. The most affected countries are the Soviet Union and Japan, while Germany is less affected because it no longer directly purchases from the United States. It is noted that in the first ten months of this year, the United States sold 11 million pounds of molybdenum to the Soviet Union, of which 5 million pounds were sold in October. During the same period, 7.9 million pounds of molybdenum were exported to Japan, of which about 2 million pounds were sold in October. As for aluminum, in the first ten months of this year, the United States exported 4.6 million pounds to the Soviet Union and 660,000 pounds to Japan. At this time, the United Kingdom and France have banned exports of these two metals due to the war. If U.S. exporters accept the State Department's advice (the U.S. aircraft factories have cooperated with the State Department and will not sell aircraft to countries that bomb ordinary people), then Germany, the Soviet Union, and Japan will be unable to obtain the molybdenum and aluminum they need. As far as Japan is concerned, the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty is only a little over a month away from expiring. In addition, the Japanese government has not shown any sign of changing its attitude towards the interests of various countries in China. Therefore, the U.S. attitude towards Japan has become increasingly firm, as evidenced by this incident. As for Germany, the naval blockade by the United Kingdom and France is very strict. Even if molybdenum and aluminum are exported to Germany, they will be intercepted on the way. The State Department's decision has little impact on Germany in practice. (15th Havas Dispatch)

### Soviet Suggestion to Japan: Conclude a Fisheries Agreement - Molotov Meets with Togo, Commercial Negotiations Scheduled for January 10th

Moscow - News received here last night states that the Soviet Union has suggested to Japan the conclusion of a long-term fisheries agreement to replace the annual treaty. Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov met yesterday with the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shigenori Togo, for two hours, and the suggestion was made during the meeting. Japanese sources here last night expressed strong belief that the Soviet Union and Japan can conclude a treaty satisfactory to both sides to resolve the long-standing fisheries disputes. Negotiations for the conclusion of a new fisheries agreement are about to begin. News from Tokyo yesterday stated that the Japanese commercial delegation has been ordered to depart Tokyo for Moscow on the 20th of this month. (United Press, 16th)

Moscow - The "Industrial Gazette" here recently reported that a portion of the oil fields on the Soviet-owned northern Sakhalin Island was originally leased to Japanese merchants for operation. Until 1930, the output of oil fields operated by the Soviets in the northern part of the island was very small, while the output of oil wells operated by Japanese merchants increased year by year. In 1922, the total annual output was only 16,000 tons, but by 1929 it had increased to 150,000 tons. Therefore, the oil industry on the entire island was almost monopolized by Japanese merchants. In order to remedy this, the Soviet government established the Sakhalin Oil Trust during the implementation of the Second Five-Year Plan and actively developed the oil industry in the northern part of the island. By this time, the company's output has also reached 150,000 tons per year. However, due to the increasing difficulties in recent years, the output of Japanese merchants' mines has not been able to maintain its original standard and has been surpassed by Soviet mines. However, the governments of Japan and the Soviet Union are about to hold negotiations to discuss commercial treaties. It is generally believed that oil from northern Sakhalin Island will certainly be one of the various goods that Japan wants to purchase from the Soviet Union. (Havas, 15th)

Moscow - Japanese Ambassador Togo recently visited People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov yesterday and held talks with him. According to certain sources, Molotov told Ambassador Togo that with regard to the issue of Japan's fishing concession rights in the Far East, the Soviet government is prepared to conclude a long-term agreement with Japan to confirm them. Negotiations between the two countries on the conclusion of a general commercial treaty are expected to be held in Moscow on January 10th of the coming year. Informed sources say that the Japanese side does not require the inclusion of a most-favored-nation clause in the future commercial treaty, so relations between the two sides are expected to gradually improve. (Havas, 15th)

Tokyo - Kuroda, secretary of the Japanese Embassy in Changchun, returned here after traveling to Germany and told reporters that future Soviet-German relations seem quite difficult and complex, but the Soviet attitude towards Japan seems to have improved. Matsushima Shikao, the former director of the Commercial Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the newly appointed Japanese ambassador to Sweden, is expected to arrive in Moscow next month, at which time concrete negotiations on the conclusion of a commercial treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan can begin. The anti-war sentiment in Europe is surprisingly strong, so there may not be large-scale military action (Reuters, 16th)

### Japanese Side Sentences American Missionary to Imprisonment

Kyoto - An American missionary, Du Courier, who went to Japan for summer vacation, was detained by the Japanese side on October 12th when he took a ship from Kobe back to Shanghai.

It is now learned that Du Courier has been sentenced by a Japanese court to four months in prison with a one-year suspended sentence today. (Reuters, 16th)

### General Yarnell of the United States Calls on Citizens to Stop Supplying Munitions to Japan - Expresses Deep Regret for the War Suffering Endured by the Chinese People - The "One Bowl of Rice Movement" Continues to Develop in New York

Washington - According to news last night, General Yarnell, former commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, appealed to the entire United States, sending letters to prominent individuals across the country, calling for their assistance in immediately stopping the supply of munitions to Japan. General Yarnell's letter was issued in the name of the "American Committee Against Participation in Japanese Aggression," and the letter stated: "In the past, I witnessed the tragedy of war and its impact on peaceful people in the Far East. Approximately 40 million Chinese people have been separated from their families, and 5 million to 10 million have died from illness and poverty. Towns far from the war zone have also been bombed, and tens of millions of non-combatants have been killed or injured. The rules of war passed by the Hague Conference have been completely disregarded. War may be inevitable, but the inhumane and barbaric actions of undisciplined troops against prisoners and non-combatants have shocked the civilized world. It is inappropriate for us to supply them with munitions to allow this war to continue. This committee's call to stop the supply of munitions to Japan will surely receive the assistance of people across the country. - Signed, Yarnell." (United Press, 16th)

New York - The Executive Committee for Relief of Chinese Refugees announced last night that the "One Bowl of Rice" movement held twice in New York in November netted US$17,160.98.

(Reuters, 16th)

Bern, Switzerland - A correspondent for the Zurich City News in the capital of Norway recently reported that after German submarines continuously sank four British and neutral ships in Norwegian territorial waters, the Norwegian government, in view of this German action, not only undermined the country's neutrality, but also prevented the export of iron ore from Norway and Sweden. Moreover, German submarines never gave a warning before sinking a ship. Therefore, it is appropriate to protest to Germany. (Havas, 15th)

London - After the British oil tanker "Templar" struck a mine and sank in the North Sea, 38 of the 40 crew members were rescued and landed in a port in northeastern England. Another British oil tanker, "Inverpool," also struck a mine in the North Sea and sank shortly thereafter. All crew members except for seven missing were rescued and landed in a port in northeastern England. (Havas, 16th)

Santiago, Chile - The German North German Company cargo ship Dusseldorf (4,930 tons) was captured by the British cruiser Diomede (4,850 tons) off the coast of Chile yesterday.

### Italian Foreign Minister Explains Foreign Policy: Fully Defending National Interests - German-Italian Alliance Still Valid - Reaffirms Unwavering Anti-Communist Stance

Rome - Foreign Minister Ciano recently delivered a speech to the Fascist Corporation Council, explaining Italy's current foreign policy, strongly stating that Premier Mussolini was the first person to resist Bolshevism, and declaring that the German-Italian alliance treaty is still valid. He concluded by saying that we are closely watching the evolution of the international situation and are prepared to assist with all practical work, but the interests of our country in the sea, land, and air, and the future of our country, must be fully defended. The following is a summary of the speech:

The Foreign Minister first said that Premier Mussolini predicted in 1927 that the situation in Europe would reach a critical juncture between 1935 and 1940. This statement has already been verified by the facts. The policies pursued by our country in the past three years have all been aimed at peace. Our formation of the Axis with Germany, our assistance to the Nationalist government in Spain, and even our signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany and Japan, were all for the sake of ensuring our national security. It is a well-known fact that our Prime Minister was the first person to resist Bolshevism. (The deputies applauded thunderously) The cooperative relationship between Germany and Italy is based on a plan to revive Europe. The purpose of the political and military agreement signed by both sides in Milan is only to offset the close cooperation between Britain and France, and does not pose a threat to any third country. The responsibility for dividing the European countries into opposing groups should not be borne by Germany and Italy.

As for the Polish issue, the authorities of that country failed to follow the teachings of the late Minister of Military Affairs, General Pilsudski, and it was their own fault that they invited disaster. Recalling that when Britain and France were negotiating with the Soviet Union to conclude a mutual assistance pact, Germany was also holding talks with the Soviet Union and kept our country informed of the content of these talks at all times. By August of this year, the tension had reached its peak. At that time, the Italian government made every effort to preserve peace, and even after Germany used force against Poland, it still appealed to the governments of Britain, France, and Germany, but all efforts failed and the war finally broke out. The Italian government, weighing the situation, issued a communique on September 2, stating that it had decided to avoid joining the war. This decision had the full agreement of the German government in advance. The head of state of that country, Hitler, sent a reply telegram to our country's Premier Mussolini on the same day, which is clear evidence of this. Recent rumors about the relationship between Germany and Italy are not true. No other country has ever exerted any pressure on Italy, and we will never tolerate other countries exerting pressure on us. The German-Italian alliance treaty, which is based on the Milan political and military agreement, is still in effect. This can be stated with certainty.

Moreover, Italy feels directly concerned about all events that may occur in the Danube River basin and the Balkan Peninsula. However, there is no need for these countries to form a neutral group. Our country maintains good relations with most neutral countries, especially Hungary, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Bulgaria. The conciliation and neutrality treaty signed between our country and Turkey in 1928 has recently been reaffirmed. As for the League of Nations, our country has had various dissatisfactions with it, and therefore withdrew from the League. In short, we are now closely watching the evolution of the international situation and are prepared to assist with all practical work, but the interests of our country in the sea, land, and air, and the future of our country, must be fully defended.

### Finland Willing to Resume Peace Talks with the Soviet Union - Determined to Resist to the End to Safeguard Independence - Foreign Minister Tanner Delivers Radio Address

Helsinki - Foreign Minister Tanner recently delivered a radio address to the people of the Soviet Union and questioned Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov. He began by saying that when Finland and the Soviet Union were negotiating in Moscow, the Soviet Union made several territorial demands. "Although there is no legal basis for this, we are willing to make the greatest concessions in order to maintain peace. Later, when our delegation returned to the country from Moscow, the two sides did not reach a solution, but we still expressed our willingness to continue negotiations in order to find a satisfactory solution for both countries. The reason why the negotiations could not be reopened is entirely due to the Soviet Union. You (referring to Molotov) have severed diplomatic relations with our country. The United States is willing to mediate, and our country has also asked Sweden to make suggestions, but you have rejected them. Before we knew it, you sent troops to attack our peace-loving nation. Our ordinary people have also been bombed everywhere, and women and children have died. Until recently, the League of Nations suggested that we cease hostilities and reopen negotiations. Although the Soviet Union and Finland are both members of the League of Nations, you still refuse to accept. Therefore, I have to ask you several questions and ask you to answer them. When the two countries were negotiating, you said that the only goal of the Soviet Union's territorial demands was to ensure the safety of the Soviet Union, especially the city of Leningrad, from external attacks. If this is the case, then the concessions we have made are to achieve this goal. We have also stated that we are prepared to continue to make concessions. However, recent events have made people suspect that the Soviet Union has ulterior motives and wants to occupy the entire territory of Finland. If so, then our nation does not want to lose its freedom and independence and be controlled by foreign countries. We can only resolutely resist to the end. The current government of Finland is supported by the entire nation. Even if the Soviet Union hires Gu Xin'an and others to organize a so-called "People's Government," it will not be able to win the support of the people. You should know all this. The Soviet Union has always boasted of upholding peace and respecting the rights of small countries. When I visited an exhibition in Moscow, I saw a slogan stating that Stalin said, "The Soviet Union does not covet foreign soil." The Soviet Union has proclaimed such principles, but it attacks the peace-loving country of Finland like that. I don't know what you have to say to explain this. Our country is still prepared to negotiate with the Soviet Union after the delegation returns to the country, in order to find a satisfactory solution, and is prepared to make new suggestions. All this is nothing but a love of peace and a desire not to cause unnecessary bloodshed. Are you prepared to reopen negotiations, thereby proving that the principles proclaimed by the Soviet Union are not empty words? I ask you to reply by radio. If you do not reply or refuse to reopen negotiations, then the value of the principles and promises put forward by the Soviet Union will be revealed to the world." (Havas, 15th)

### Soviet War Report

Moscow - The Leningrad Military District issued a war report yesterday stating that "On December 15, on the Murmansk front, Soviet troops occupied Salmijärvi, 60 kilometers south of Pechenga. On the Ukhta front, they advanced to a line 128 kilometers from the border. On the Petrozavodsk front, they occupied the villages of Rebasi and a railway branch line. On the Keksholm front, the Soviet offensive is also developing smoothly. The air force is still inactive due to bad weather." (TASS, 16th)

### Sanyo Maru Passes British Blockade Line - Carrying a Batch of German Goods

Rotterdam, Netherlands - The Japanese ship Sanyo Maru (8,000 tons), carrying a batch of German goods, was originally scheduled to set sail from this port on the 9th of this month to pass through the blockade line of the British and French navies and return to Japan. However, due to the fact that Britain and Japan were negotiating on the blockade issue, it did not leave until 6:55 this morning. It is not yet known whether the British and Japanese authorities have reached an agreement. According to the Japanese side, the German goods carried by the ship were purchased before Britain and France announced the blockade of German exports, and Britain and France should allow it to pass through the blockade line.

### Fierce Battles Between Finnish and Soviet Troops on the Eastern Front of Finland - The Sound of Artillery is Clearly Audible in Norway - Finnish Troops Retreat and Implement a Scorched Earth Policy

Oslo, Norway - There was a fierce battle 30 kilometers southeast of Salla last night. The sound of artillery fire was clearly audible even in Norway. Soviet aircraft and tanks were mobilized and cooperated with the infantry in the fierce battle. This morning, the sound of artillery gradually subsided. People in Sør-Varanger, a town on the Norwegian border, learned that Salla had been devastated. All buildings over 100 kilometers from Boris Gleb to Alakurtti have been reduced to rubble. The retreating Finnish troops completely destroyed all bridges and placed landmines everywhere to block the advance of the Soviet troops. Even the ice in the lake was broken in many places. According to the explanation of Finnish military observers, this retreat is entirely for strategic reasons, and the Finnish troops will launch a counter-attack from the south. (Haitong, 16th)

Oslo, Norway - According to reliable sources, Finnish troops have begun to retreat from the eastern front and are implementing a scorched earth policy, having destroyed all bridges. Also, fierce battles occurred last night in the towns of Salmijärvi and Piägajärvi (both north of Lake Ladoga). It is still unknown whether Salmijärvi is still in the hands of Finnish troops. In addition, it is heard that Finnish troops will soon launch a counter-attack in the Karelian Isthmus in the south. (Havas, 16th)

Moscow - According to a radio announcement here today, Soviet Red Army has broken through the Mannerheim Line at a certain point. All Finnish fortifications have been destroyed, and the Red Army is now attacking the Finnish troops from the rear. (United Press, 16th)

Helsinki - General Wallenius, commander of the Finnish army, recently told foreign journalists that the battle of Suomussalmi was the first "decisive battle" of the Soviet-Finnish War. Finnish troops have occupied Suomussalmi, and Soviet troops have retreated to Lake Kiantajärvi. General Wallenius believes that the Soviet-Finnish war will continue for at least one year. (Haitong, 16th)

Helsinki - The General Staff recently issued a war report stating: (1) On the southern Karelian Isthmus, Soviet troops launched repeated attacks under the cover of artillery and tanks, but were all repulsed by our troops. They also launched continuous attacks near the city of Peräjoki in the central part of the Isthmus, but were defeated. Our troops destroyed many Soviet tanks. (2) On the north side of Lake Ladoga, Soviet troops launched a large-scale attack between the city of Loimola and the coast, but were also repulsed. Our troops captured five tanks and a large number of military supplies, and took advantage of the victory to advance towards the city of Tuulilampi. (3) The town of Suomussalmi has been recovered by our troops, and the highway east of the town has been cut off. Soviet troops have retreated west of the city of Piägajärvi and have been surrounded by our troops. (4) The Soviet Navy shelled the coast near Koivisto and Turku. Local batteries also returned fire. A 2,000-ton Soviet destroyer was badly damaged and is reported to have sunk. (5) Soviet aircraft flew over the southwestern and northern parts of our country, including the port of Pechenga, and dropped bombs, but there was no damage. Our aircraft repeatedly flew over Soviet positions for reconnaissance and attacked the Red Army, achieving considerable success. They also dropped incendiary bombs, setting fire to the Red Army's gasoline. (Havas, 15th)

### Uruguay Limits German Pocket Battleship to 72 Hours; Must Depart; British and French Fleets Gather in South American Waters; Graf Spee Will Have Difficulty Breaking the Blockade

London, Reuters reports from here that the Uruguayan government has stipulated a 72-hour limit for the German warship "Graf Spee" to leave Montevideo, with the deadline being approximately 2:30 AM tomorrow (Central Time) (Reuters, 16th).

Montevideo: The Uruguayan government has stipulated that the German pocket battleship "Graf Spee," which has fled into port, must depart within 72 hours; beyond that time, it will be detained until the end of the war. It is reported that the Uruguayan government's decision is absolutely final. According to Reuters, the deadline will be approximately midnight on the 16th (1:30 AM on the 17th, Shanghai time). People here generally believe that the German warship is preparing to slip out of port at any time without waiting for repairs to be completed. However, according to the opinions of the captains of British ships sunk by the German warship, who have now been released, it is believed that the "Graf Spee," having suffered such heavy damage, would probably not risk going to sea again unless it received a definite order from Berlin. At the same time, it is also heard that the "Graf Spee" is now waiting for workers to be sent from the capital of Argentina to begin large-scale repairs, because all companies in Montevideo capable of undertaking this work have refused due to opposition to Nazism (Reuters, 16th).

London, Reuters has just obtained information from responsible sources stating that after the British Minister to Uruguay, Mr. Teale, exchanged views with the Uruguayan Foreign Ministry, the Uruguayan government has decided to allow the German warship Graf Spee to remain in Montevideo for 72 hours, counting from the time the ship entered the port on Wednesday evening. During this period, the German warship is permitted to make necessary repairs for sailing out of the port. As for rumors that the "Graf Spee" may sail along the coast within Uruguayan territorial waters to reach the capital of Argentina, observers here believe that although this is not impossible, it is extremely dangerous. Britain acknowledges the three-mile territorial limit, but reserves all rights regarding the 300-mile neutral zone around the Americas stipulated by the Pan-American Conference (Reuters, 16th).

Montevideo: The French 26,500-ton battlecruiser "Dunkerque," armed with eight 13-inch caliber guns, has also arrived outside the port here, joining with British cruisers to monitor the movements of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee," preventing it from escaping in the meantime. According to news from here this morning, the number of British warships patrolling outside the port has increased to as many as seven. According to reliable sources here, if the "Admiral Graf Spee" does not leave the port before 8:50 PM on Sunday, it will be detained from then on. In other words, Uruguay is only giving the German pocket battleship 72 hours. This matter has been notified by the Uruguayan Foreign Minister to the ministers of Britain, France, Germany, and the United States separately. On the British side, the strength has greatly increased. The 10,000-ton British cruiser "Cumberland," which is extremely familiar in Shanghai, has arrived there. There is also the 36,000-ton battlecruiser "Renown," armed with eight 15-inch caliber main guns. In addition, there is the battleship "Barham," 31,000 tons, also with eight 15-inch caliber guns. Furthermore, the aircraft carrier "Ark Royal," etc., have all arrived outside the port, preparing to surround and attack the German warship (United Press, 16th).

Capital of Uruguay: According to unconfirmed sources from the National Socialist Party, Germany is concentrating warships and submarines along the coast of South America to meet the "Admiral Graf Spee" when it leaves the port of Montevideo and engage in battle with British warships (United Press, 16th).

### Uruguay Lodges Strong Protest to Britain and Germany; Accuses Them of Violating the "Panama Declaration"; Uruguayan and Argentine Navies Implement Joint Patrols

New York: According to a Montevideo dispatch published in "The New York Times," Uruguay has taken measures to send strong notes to Britain and Germany regarding the Anglo-German naval battle, with an attached sea chart indicating that part of the battle occurred within the mouth of the River Plate, and warships from both sides at one point fired at each other within the three-mile limit. The note further points out that this battle took place within the 300-mile neutral zone around the Americas recently stipulated by the Pan-American Conference. Although the River Plate is more than 300 miles wide, the governments of Argentina and Uruguay both believe that once it enters the river, it falls under their jurisdiction. Therefore, the engagement of British and German warships therein has violated international law. The Uruguayan government has announced that the navies of that country and Argentina have established a joint patrol to prevent the recurrence of such naval battles (Reuters, 16th).

London: Reuters has learned that London officialdom has not received actual dispatches regarding Uruguay's protest due to the naval battle between the British cruiser and the German pocket battleship "Graf Spee" (Reuters, 16th).

Washington: Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that the 21 American nations may convene a meeting to discuss countermeasures regarding the Anglo-German battle in the American "security zone" off the coast of Uruguay. If this meeting does take place, it will be convened in Panama. At the Pan-American Conference held in Panama in mid-September, it was resolved that Panama would be the intermediary between the American countries and the belligerent nations (United Press, 16th).

### British Official Boasts of Naval Battle Victory

London: Secretary of the Navy Churchill telegraphed the New Zealand Minister of Defence to express his appreciation for the meritorious service of the crew of the British cruiser "Achilles," of which more than 300 members were from New Zealand. According to naval officials, in the battle in the South Atlantic, four members of the "Achilles" were killed and three were wounded. The casualty numbers of the other two cruisers, "Exeter" and "Ajax," will also be announced as soon as possible. The German pocket battleship "Graf Spee," which fought against the three British cruisers, was equipped with six 11-inch caliber guns, firing shells weighing 670 pounds. It first engaged the "Ajax," which only had 6-inch caliber guns firing 100-pound shells. The German warship then exchanged fire with the "Achilles," but the "Achilles" had the same firepower as the "Ajax." Finally, the "Exeter" rushed forward to engage, but the "Exeter" had slightly stronger firepower, equipped with 8-inch caliber guns that could fire 256-pound shells. Moreover, the "Graf Spee's" broadside weighed a total of 4,708 pounds, while the British cruisers' combined broadside weighed only 3,126 pounds (Reuters, 16th).

### German Soldiers Who Died in Action Given Funeral; British Merchant Fleet Presents Wreaths

Capital of Uruguay: Thirty-six officers and soldiers of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" who died in action in a naval battle with three British cruisers were given a funeral here recently. Officials from the German legation, the Italian minister, and many officers from the Uruguayan army and navy attended to offer condolences. There were a total of 21 wreaths, one of which was inscribed with "To the brave warriors of the naval battle, from the British merchant fleet" (Havas, 15th).

### Soviet Government Considers Breaking Off Relations with Britain and France; Germany Hopes for Early Peace Between Soviet Union and Finland; Netherlands Explains Reason for Abstention

Paris: The *Journal des Débats* reports from Sweden that after the League of Nations announced , the Soviet government is now considering breaking off diplomatic relations with and . However, Premier Voroshilov does not seem to mind, and German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg also seems indifferent, contrary to general expectations. German leader Hitler, on the other hand, seeks to intimidate Sweden. Although the Swedish government recently proposed negotiations with Germany, was rejected and received a German note with a warning nature. This is likely the reason why the country's representative to the League of Nations dared not take a positive attitude (Havas, 16th).

Berlin: Regarding the League of Nations' expulsion of the Soviet Union, German political figures believe that it will not lead to any changes in the current situation, nor will it provide any benefit to Finland, as what Finland hopes for is clearly more effective assistance. Germany believes that Finland should negotiate peace with the Soviet Union as soon as possible and should not intensify its attitude. As for Chamberlain's claim that Germany seeks to exploit the Soviet-Finnish conflict to threaten the Scandinavian countries, German political figures denounce it as malicious slander, not worth refuting. German newspapers have been commenting on the League of Nations' activities, all saying that the League has only two powerful countries, which is not significant (Haitong, 16th).

Amsterdam: A Dutch semi-official figure issued a statement last night explaining the reasons why the Netherlands voted in favor of expelling the Soviet Union from the League of Nations, pointing out that the League of Nations Secretary-General launched a movement to aid Finland, convening League member states to jointly help the attacked country. The Netherlands considered whether supporting this appeal meant willingly participating in the Western European warring factions or whether it was a collective action of League members. As a result, it was decided before the vote to state that the cooperation of the Netherlands did not mean participating in collective action of the League, but rather contributing its technical assistance to Finland based on humanitarian principles. The Dutch semi-official figure continued, stating that the Dutch government believes that the League of Nations in its current state does not have sufficient power to implement international actions to sanction aggressor countries. This expulsion of the Soviet Union is actually because the Soviet Union first distanced itself from the League (Haitong, 16th).

Paris: After the League of Nations announced the Soviet Union's expulsion, it was generally expected that the country would launch a fierce counterattack. Diplomatic figures here also stated recently that although the Soviet Union has not yet broken off diplomatic relations with the countries that voted in favor of this move in the League of Nations General Assembly and the Administrative Council, one cannot immediately assume that this matter is over just because the country has remained silent so far. To what extent the country's aggressive attitude may develop in the future will depend on its strength and its interests. As it stands, the actions of the Scandinavian Peninsula countries are most noteworthy. Because Germany is currently touting the good relations between Germany and the Soviet Union, it is carrying out activities in the Scandinavian Peninsula countries, namely, on the one hand, acknowledging that these countries are under threat from the Soviet Union, and offering to intercede with the Soviet Union for these countries, and on the other hand, making it a condition that these countries accept the neutral policy it dictates (Havas, 15th).

### Soviet Authorities Comment on League of Nations Resolution; Believe It Stems from a Conspiracy by Britain and France; Lacks Political and Moral Force

Moscow: Regarding the League of Nations Administrative Council's decision on the 14th to "expel" the Soviet Union from the League of Nations, Soviet authorities have issued a commentary. TASS is hereby authorized to announce the following:

The League of Nations Administrative Council's decision on December 14th to "expel" the Soviet Union from the League of Nations and to condemn "the Soviet Union's hostile actions against Finland" is, in the Soviet Union's opinion, only enough to provoke ridicule and make its unfortunate creators a laughingstock. First of all, we must solemnly point out that this resolution of the Administrative Council was passed under the direction of the ruling classes of Britain and France, and they have absolutely no moral or formal right to talk about "the issue of aggression." Britain and France have long seized vast territories in Asia and Africa, and still act arrogantly, controlling everything. Recently, they also rejected Germany's peace proposal aimed at ending the war early, and insisted on continuing the war until "ultimate victory" is achieved. These two facts alone are enough to expose the aggressive policy of the British and French ruling classes, making them less inclined to talk about the definition of aggression, and aware that they have already abandoned their moral and formal right to criticize others' "aggression," especially their qualification to comment on whether the Soviet Union is "aggressive."

Secondly, we must point out that the relationship between the Soviet Union and Finland has been defined by the Treaty of Mutual Assistance and Friendship concluded on December 2nd between the Soviet government and the People's Government of the Democratic Republic of Finland. This convention fully guarantees the peaceful relations between the Soviet Union and Finland, resolves the issue of safeguarding Finland's independence and the security of Leningrad, as well as the Soviet Union's transfer of its territory to Finland, so that the Karelian region can return to its homeland in a manner satisfactory to both parties. According to this convention, the Soviet Union exchanged an area of 70,000 square kilometers with a population of over 100,000 for Finland's territory of less than 4,000 square kilometers with a population of approximately 25,000. If the main definition of aggression is the seizure of another country's territory and the forced control of the people of the occupied area, then the world seems unable to deny that the convention concluded between the Soviet Union and the Republic of Finland is not only not an act of aggression, but rather a practical demonstration of the Soviet Union's peaceful and friendly policy towards Finland, aimed at safeguarding Finland's independence and expanding its territory to make it stronger. Conversely, if the current Britain and France were to encounter such circumstances, there is no doubt that their actions would be completely different. They would brazenly invade Finnish territory, as they did in the past when they invaded India, Annam, Morocco, and Soviet territory in 1918-1919.

Finally, we must point out that the Treaty of Mutual Assistance and Friendship between the Soviet Union and the Republic of Finland is confirmed to fully guarantee peace between the two countries. It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet Union not only does not wage war on Finland, but also has no intention of doing so. Those who, under the direction of a third country, violate the will of the Finnish people and cause Finland to wage war on the Soviet Union are none other than the now bankrupt Mannerheimite old Finnish rulers who do not want this convention to be realized.

Therefore, the real purpose of the League of Nations Administrative Council's resolution is not to strive for peace or to aid the Finnish people, but rather to aid the bankrupt Mannerheimite reactionaries who oppose the Finnish people, thereby further igniting the flames of war by forcing the Finnish people to be dragged into a war caused by Mannerheimite provocations. If the League of Nations were still a "tool for peace," its current mission should be to strive to end the war between the British-French bloc and Germany. However, the current member states of the League of Nations are not doing this, but are declaring their support for the policy of the Mannerheim-Tanner challenge faction in Finland, taking the path of inciting another war in northeastern Europe. Therefore, the League of Nations, under the manipulation of its current directors, has been transformed from a possible "tool for peace" into a genuine tool for the British-French military bloc to continue and incite war in Europe. Judging from this obscure transformation of the League of Nations, its resolution to "expel" the Soviet Union is not surprising. Since the imperialist gentlemen have decided to turn the League of Nations into a tool for safeguarding their war interests, they must find an excuse to expel the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union is the only force capable of opposing their imperialist conspiracies and exposing their aggressive policies.

The League of Nations and its already discredited prestige willingly do this, we have nothing to say. However, if we investigate thoroughly, those who benefit from this may ultimately still be the Soviet Union. First, the Soviet Union will no longer bear the moral responsibility for all the League of Nations' ignominious actions. All responsibility for "allowing the Soviet Union to remain outside the League of Nations" will be borne by the League of Nations and its British and French directors. Second, the Soviet Union is no longer bound by the League of Nations and can be completely free.

The process by which the League of Nations prepared and passed the aforementioned anti-Soviet resolution is itself sufficient to reveal the conspiracy by Britain and France to achieve the aforementioned purpose. Everyone knows that there are a total of 15 countries on the League of Nations Administrative Council, and only 7 countries voted in favor of "expelling" the Soviet Union this time, which is a minority. The other 8 countries either abstained from voting or did not attend. These 7 countries that voted in favor of "expelling" the Soviet Union are Britain, France, Belgium, Bolivia, Egypt, the Union of South Africa, and the Dominican Republic. Thus, the "representatives" of Britain and France, with a combined population of only 89 million, plus the 5 countries of Belgium, Bolivia, Egypt, the Union of South Africa, and the Dominican Republic, with a combined population of only 38 million, decided to "expel" the Soviet Union, with a population of 182 million. What's more, in order to obtain this number of votes, the British and French representatives even had to change the composition of the League of Nations Administrative Council on the eve of the vote by special conspiratorial means, namely, by passing the League of Nations General Assembly, recommending the representatives of the Union of South Africa and Bolivia (the latter having been re-elected) as non-permanent directors of the Administrative Council, and the Egyptian representative as a so-called temporary director. Therefore, among the 7 directors on the Administrative Council who supported "expelling" the Soviet Union, 3 were temporarily and specially elected.

The fact that British and French representatives conducted this kind of conspiracy within the League of Nations has definitively eliminated any political and moral force of the results of the vote on December 14th. It is undoubtedly due to the fact that the League of Nations is entirely controlled by an atmosphere of political reaction and moral corruption that this kind of conspiracy can occur. What value can there be in a resolution of the League of Nations passed in this kind of atmosphere (TASS, 16th)?

### Italian Mount Vesuvius Volcano Erupts

Naples, Italy: Mount Vesuvius, which has recently been heavily covered in snow, has suddenly erupted again. This morning, a torrent of boiling lava over 650 feet wide flowed out, and it is feared that the crater will be exposed again, which will cause immense disaster. The authorities are now preparing to evacuate the residents of the villages near the volcano (Reuters, 16th).

### Western Front Warfare Gradually Intensifies; British Prime Minister Inspects Expeditionary Force

Paris: Although the warfare on the Western Front is still limited to encounters between patrol teams and reconnaissance teams, it has gradually intensified, and the number of soldiers on both sides in the encounters is increasing day by day, and the fighting is becoming more fierce. In the past 24 hours, two strong German reconnaissance teams approached the British lines on the Lys River, and their activities almost reached the level of an attack. In the Vosges area, where the border line passes through the forest, about 30 to 40 French and German soldiers engaged in a fierce battle that lasted for quite a long time (Reuters, 16th).

London: British Prime Minister Chamberlain began his tour of inspection of the British army in France yesterday, and has arrived by plane at an airfield behind the British lines, accompanied by Major General Ismay, Secretary of the British Imperial Defence Committee. The British Prime Minister and others were traveling in ordinary planes, which were protected by several fighter planes. After arriving, Chamberlain had lunch with Viscount Gort, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces, and then drove to the Air Force Headquarters to inspect the battle charts and various arrangements. The British also saw the work in the telephone switchboard room in the underground room, where there were 1,400 telephone calls every day, and as many as 200 in each hour. The war correspondents at the Air Force Headquarters were all received and talked to by the British Prime Minister. One reporter said, "It is difficult to write about the war." An officer interjected, "Worry is better than bombs." The British Prime Minister said, "From my point of view, this is a matter of personal preference, but as far as I am concerned, I would rather worry than be bombed." The French people welcomed the British Prime Minister's tour of France very much, which was indeed a characteristic of the British Prime Minister's trip (Reuters, 16th).

### Berlin Announces Border Closure; Gunfire Heard on Belgian Coast; Nature Seemingly Quite Serious

Berlin: According to an announcement made here today, from the 18th of this month, from 8 PM every night to 7 AM the next morning, all borders with Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and Switzerland will be closed, and only regular trains will be allowed to pass through.

### President of Panama Dies

### The Chinese Army Counterattacks Chao'an City; Fierce Battles Along the Chao-Shan Railway

A Shantou dispatch states that on the morning of November 12th, just as the sky began to brighten, twelve Chinese Air Force planes suddenly appeared over Chao'an City. They divided into four groups to control the airspace and circled over the Japanese positions for approximately forty-five minutes. Amidst the anti-aircraft fire network of the Japanese forces on Hulu Mountain, they dove down to drop bombs, moving back and forth with ease. Zhugao Mountain, Jinshan, the West Lake Station, the East Gate Warehouse, the Japanese barracks at the Han Wen Gong Ancestral Hall on Hanshan Mountain, and the Japanese artillery positions were all hit and caught fire, destroying military supplies, vehicles, and more. The Japanese suffered over a hundred casualties and significant losses. On the 15th, three more planes appeared over Dahao, dropping over ten bombs on the Japanese warships docked there. The Japanese warships scattered in panic, and it is rumored that they also suffered considerable losses. The large army from Anjie Luhua launched a two-pronged attack on Chao'an City on November 13th, engaging in bloody battles in the northern and southern suburbs. The plainclothes special forces of the Chinese security forces attacked everywhere in Fuyang, Anbu, Chengcheng, Dongjin, and Yunbu, killing thirty to forty Japanese soldiers in each location. On the morning of the 14th, the Japanese army moved out from Caitang in several directions, creating disturbances. Over forty Japanese soldiers carrying machine guns fiercely attacked Hailian Mountain, engaging in a standoff for an hour before the Japanese forces collapsed and retreated. On the morning of the 15th, over five hundred Japanese soldiers from Caitang, supported by seven mortars and covered by three planes, advanced north along the railway line towards Wuyang Mountain and Zhanglin Bridge. Japanese aircraft dropped forty to fifty bombs on the Chinese positions, causing the Chinese army to retreat over ten *li*. That evening at 9:00 PM, Chinese reinforcements arrived and retook Zhanglin Bridge. Also on the morning of the 15th, the Japanese army's Nozoe unit, entrenched in Chao'an City, joined forces with puppet troops in an attempt to break through the Chinese encirclement. They concentrated their firepower on West Lake Mountain, supported by four heavy cannons and over a hundred artillerymen, first bombarding the Tongqiao Shimuwei area, and then advancing on the Chinese positions on Aoding Mountain, using artillery to cover the infantry's advance. From morning till night, fierce battles continued. They charged down the mountain several times, but were annihilated by the Chinese army, leaving behind over a hundred corpses. By the 16th, the Japanese offensive had been thwarted, and they had completely collapsed. The Chinese army regained the upper hand and controlled Chao'an City.

### Shaoguan, Guangdong Province: Strict Prohibition of Japanese Goods; Qujiang County Takes the Lead

A Shaoguan dispatch states that the Qujiang County government, in order to strictly prohibit the promotion and sale of Japanese goods, has specifically formulated temporary measures for long-term prohibition and inspection of Japanese goods, as follows: (1) In order to first eliminate Japanese goods in Shaoguan City and eradicate their source, the government has specially organized an inspection team, jointly organized by the government's investigation and prohibition group and local agencies and organizations, which will send personnel to participate. (2) Taking Shaoguan City as the starting point, eight inspection teams will be organized and divided into eight sections, each team being responsible for a section. (3) Each team will consist of three people, two of whom will be appointed by the government, and the remaining one will be invited to participate from local agencies and legal entities. In addition, the government will send one supervisor for every two teams, who will be responsible for overall coordination. (4) The inspection of Japanese goods, trademarks, and types will be clearly instructed in advance by the head of the government's investigation and prohibition group, who will work with the police to carry out the task in the designated section. (5) The identification of various categories of Japanese goods will temporarily use the "Compilation of Japanese Goods Trademarks" issued by the Trademark Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs this year as the standard, supplemented by other modified trademarks. (6) After inspecting Japanese goods, the investigation and prohibition group will issue a receipt, which will be signed and stamped by the inspectors and given to the owner of the goods for safekeeping. If necessary, the owner of the Japanese goods may be required to provide a written guarantee to be available for questioning at any time, or they may be detained. (7) If there are still doubts about the seized Japanese goods, they will be sent to the appraisal committee for appraisal. If it is determined that they are definitely not Japanese goods, they will be returned to the owner. (8) The method of disposing of seized Japanese goods will be submitted to the government for approval on a case-by-case basis. (9) A letter will be sent to the Guangdong Provincial Anti-Smuggling Bureau, Renru Tax Bureau, and the county's tax collection office, etc., asking them to pay special attention to imported goods. If they are Japanese goods, regardless of whether taxes have been paid or not, they should be detained first in accordance with the telegram order and sent to the government's investigation and prohibition group for appraisal. If suspected Japanese goods are encountered, the same procedure must be followed in order to eradicate the source. (10) These measures will be implemented from the date of promulgation and will be submitted to superiors for record.

### Rice Prices Also Expensive in Fujian Province; Due to Manipulation by Unscrupulous Merchants and Embargoes in Various Regions; Provincial Government Has Ordered Strict Prevention in All Counties

A Fuzhou dispatch states that the autumn harvest in the coastal and inland areas of Fujian Province this year has been very abundant, but rice prices have instead been rising daily. Currently, the price of rice in the coastal areas has risen from 15 yuan to around 30 yuan per *shi* in less than a month. The price of rice in the inland areas has also risen from 5 or 6 yuan to 12 or 13 yuan per *shi*, making it very difficult for the people to afford food. Large cities such as Fuzhou, Nanping, Quanzhou, and Xinghua have merchants and gentry jointly organizing price controls, but each *dou* still costs 1.7 or 8 yuan, causing the prices of other daily necessities to also rise accordingly. The biggest reasons for this are: (1) Merchants mistakenly believe that the transportation and sale of grain will be managed by the province, limited to only one grain department of a trading company, and many dare not raise funds for procurement and transportation. (2) A few unscrupulous merchants are unwilling to transport the rice they have obtained permits from the government to transport to the local area for sale, storing it midway to wait for higher prices. Large households in the countryside also hoard the grain they have collected, refusing to sell it. (3) People in various regions mutually prohibit exports, not only are they not allowed to transport to other counties, but this district is not allowed to transport to that district, and even this village is not allowed to transport to that village, resulting in this village having a lot of surplus rice, while the neighboring village has nowhere to buy rice. The above three reasons have led to the current situation of expensive grain and rice shortage in Fujian Province. The Provincial Assembly and the Provincial New Life Movement Association have both submitted relief proposals to the provincial government. The Provincial Assembly's proposals are: (1) Allow merchants to freely procure and sell. (2) Temporarily suspend the collection of rice taxes in various regions. (3) Provide as much convenience as possible to grain transport ships and do not completely block them. (4) Fair prices should be sought in various regions, they should not be too high, nor should they be too low. (5) Stipulate measures to crack down on hoarding and speculation. (6) Telegraph Jiangxi Province to allow this province to purchase rice. The Provincial New Life Movement Association's proposals are: (1) All transportation agencies in the province should give priority to the task of transporting rice. (2) Trading companies in various regions should fully mobilize to procure grain for relief. (3) Permits to procure rice should be issued quickly to all formal merchants. (4) Order all counties not to prohibit the export of rice and strictly prohibit hoarding and speculation. (5) Prohibit all unnecessary consumption, such as brewing wine, raising ducks, and making rice cakes. (6) Promote the movement to eat two meals a day and eat mixed grains. The relief measures that the provincial government has separately implemented are: (1) Strictly clarify rumors that the government only allows trading companies to transport and sell rice, and does not allow rice merchants to operate or hire ships to transport rice, causing rice merchants to take the opportunity to hoard and speculate, citing business closures, resulting in high rice prices. (2) Order all counties that grain within the province should be freely traded. Regardless of military or civilian agencies, if merchants hold permits to procure and transport rice or apply for permits to transport rice out, they should inspect and release them and should not obstruct them. (3) Offer rewards for reporting large households hoarding and unscrupulous merchants monopolizing. Once verified, in addition to severe punishment, the stored rice will be sold, and 40% of the proceeds will be offered as a reward. (4) Stop price controls from today and order rice merchants to freely transport and sell rice, gradually restoring the rice market, and explain to the people that price controls are not a fundamental solution to the rice shortage. (5) The trading company, transportation company, and provincial bank, three provincial-run business agencies, jointly plan to allocate funds to purchase rice and transport it to various regions for relief. Chen Xuan, the general manager of the trading company, went to Jiangxi yesterday to negotiate the purchase of a large amount of rice to be transported to Fujian. After these separate relief measures are taken, the price of rice in Fujian Province can be expected to fall.

The Number of Students Admitted: The number of students admitted according to the above standards is shown in the table below.

Region (Abbreviation: Region), Number of Applicants (Abbreviation: Applicants), Number Admitted to Universities (Abbreviation: University), Number Admitted to Preparatory Classes (Abbreviation: Preparatory), Percentage of University Admissions to Applicants (Abbreviation: Percentage)

Chongqing Region, Applicants: 3456, University: 935, Preparatory: 198, Percentage: 27.05
Nanzheng Region, Applicants: 1216, University: 318, Preparatory: 75, Percentage: 25.98
Kunming Region, Applicants: 1768, University: 526, Preparatory: 57, Percentage: 29.75
Guiyang Region, Applicants: 778, University: 243, Preparatory: 42, Percentage: 32.25
Guilin Region, Applicants: 1074, University: 296, Preparatory: 44, Percentage: 27.56
Chenxi Region, Applicants: 694, University: 196, Preparatory: 33, Percentage: 28.28

Qujiang Region, Applicants: 172, University: 44, Preparatory: 10, Percentage: 2.50
Hong Kong Region, Applicants: 590, University: 347, Preparatory: 102, Percentage: 21.82
Lanzhou Region, Applicants: 100, University: 16, Preparatory: 20, Percentage: 16.00

Total Applicants: 20006, Total University Admissions: 5371, Total Preparatory Class Admissions: 1103, Overall Percentage: 26.85

From the table on the right, we can see that the number of students admitted this year accounts for about one-quarter of the applicants. In other words, one out of every four is admitted. Another issue that is of great concern to the general public is how many students with equivalent qualifications applied and were admitted. The total number of reports for students with equivalent qualifications has not yet been fully calculated, but according to statistics from the six regions of Chongqing, Kunming, Hong Kong, Nanzheng, Chenxi, and Chengdu, students with equivalent qualifications account for 26% of the applicants. If we calculate according to this ratio, the number of people nationwide who applied this year with equivalent qualifications is approximately 5,000. The ratio of those admitted with equivalent qualifications to those admitted as new university students is about 8%, which is less than the prescribed standard. Students from Mongolia and Tibet and overseas Chinese students are admitted with more lenient criteria. A total of 13 students from Mongolia and Tibet were admitted to universities and 18 to preparatory classes. A total of 19 overseas Chinese students were admitted to universities and 30 to preparatory classes. Furthermore, in terms of the number of new university students admitted by group, the second group had the most, followed by the first group, and the third group had the fewest, as detailed in the table below.

Group 1, Number of Applicants: 9387, Number Admitted: 1937, Percentage: 20.35
Group 2, Number of Applicants: 7462, Number Admitted: 2792, Percentage: 37.42
Group 3, Number of Applicants: 3157, Number Admitted: 642, Percentage: 20.34
Total Applicants: 20006, Total Admissions: 5371, Percentage: 26.85

### Education Department of the Refugee Association Changed to Education Section

Since the second half of this year, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has seen an endless rise in the market prices of grain and various daily necessities, resulting in huge expenses for the association. Moreover, donations from all sectors of the refugee community have been decreasing daily, making refugee relief efforts even more difficult. In order to save money, all departments have been merged into one office since this month, reducing staff and tightening expenses. The reorganization has now been completed. The association is determined to continue promoting the education of refugee children as before. All of the original Education Department has been reduced in scope and renamed the Education Section. Various craft training classes formerly run by the Education Department have been transferred to a newly established Industrial Training Section, which will run training classes in various fields such as chauffeur, sewing, grass weaving, barber, wireless repair, nursing, Chinese and English typewriter, etc., and will continue to operate. However, the efficiency of the training must be increased compared to before. New industrial training plans are currently being drafted to improve training work, so that refugees can have good skills to support themselves.

### More Confidence in Winning the First Division Championship; Lido Defeated Portugal Yesterday; Achieving a Great Record of Six Wins in Six Games with a Score of Four to One; West Force and East Hanlai Both Suffered Defeats

Lido's hope for the Western Union Football First Division Championship is growing stronger and more confident. Yesterday at Yiyuan, they defeated Portugal 4-1, achieving a great record of six wins in six games. In the first half, Lido took a 2-0 lead. In the two games at the Racecourse, East Hanlai lost to St. Francis 2-4, and West Force lost to French Commerce 1-3. Since these British giants have each lost one and drawn one, there is no question about Lido's championship. Yesterday at Yiyuan, there were about 1,000 spectators. Portuguese veterans Ma Shan'er and Cora Sha played, but they were old and past their prime, not as good as before. Lido missed countless opportunities, otherwise, the score would have been much higher.

Lido: Lu Zhongen, Li Yichen, Zhang Lingen, Yan Shixin, Meng Yiliang, Jiang Zhaoxiang, Cao Qiuting, Sun Jinshun, Huang Kehou, Xu Wenkui, Wu Qixiang

Portugal: Su Ruo, Ma Shan'er, Aquino, Ma Han, Oliveira, Xue Erfo, Larson L. Luochai Liao, J. Luochai Liao Cora Sha, H. Lemidi

Lido Scored Two Goals First: Lido attacked first. Ma Shan'er was still powerful and defused the danger several times. Kehou got an assist from Jinshun and shot from 15 yards, but it was blocked by Ma Shan'er. After Wenkui missed a sure goal from outside the penalty area, he received a hook from Qiuting and lost another sure goal in front of the goal. It wasn't until 20 minutes that Marder lost his footing. Jinshun stole the ball and passed it to Wenkui. Wenkui kicked from seven yards and opened the scoring. Ten minutes later, Qixiang passed to Qiuting, who pressed down and shot, but Su Ruo pushed it out not far. Jinshun swept it in from five yards, making it 2-0. Not long after, Lido's Zhang Lingen was injured and left the field, playing with ten men. However, the attack did not weaken. At the end of the first half, Lido took a 2-0 lead.

High-Pitched Triumphant Songs: The second half started, and Lido was still playing with ten men. Zhaoxiang and Shixin served as defenders, Yichen served as center, Qixiang retreated to midfield, and Kehou temporarily filled the right wing. The Portuguese team was eager to win and attacked with seven men, but still showed no improvement. After ten minutes, Lido had a corner kick opportunity. Qiuting took it and it was well placed. Wenkui jumped up and scored again, making it 3-0. Two minutes later, the Portuguese team's five forwards advanced together. Cora Sha shot high from the crowd and the ball went into the net, pulling back a goal. After 20 minutes, Zhang Lingen returned to the field, and the five forwards resumed their original positions at the start of the game, greatly increasing their momentum. In just six minutes, Qiuting got the ball and dribbled forward, shooting high from the left corner. The ball was headed into the goal by Su Ruo, making it 4-1. The victory was secured. After that, Lido continued to attack quickly, but all shots went wide. Yiliang was injured and rested. Not long after entering the field, the referee blew the whistle, and Lido won 4-1.

### Rice Market to Implement Price Limits Set by the Municipal Council Today; The Highest Price for Domestic Rice is Set at 40 Yuan per Shi; The Highest Price for Ke Xian Rice is Set at 33 Yuan; Prices Decrease Progressively for Medium and Lower Grades; Foreign Rice is Not Subject to This Rule

The rice-grabbing frenzy has spread to the central district of Shanghai, causing concerns about public order. He Dehui, the Chinese Affairs Officer of the Public Concession's Municipal Council, summoned Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Zhou Zhizhen, Gu Yisheng, Lu Wenshao, Zhang Nianxuan, and other leaders of the city's rice industry to the bureau again at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to discuss the recent serious rice and grain problems. Three measures were jointly decided: (1) Resetting price limits: (A) The price of domestic rice must not exceed 40 yuan per shi, with prices decreasing progressively for medium and lower grades. (B) The highest price for Ke Xian rice must not exceed 33 yuan per shi, with prices decreasing progressively for medium and lower grades. (C) The prices of foreign rice are not subject to this rule due to fluctuating source costs. (2) Protecting the business of legitimate rice merchants: (A) He Dehui, the Chinese Affairs Officer of the Municipal Council, will immediately notify all police stations to increase protection and immediately notify the Director-General of the French Concession's Municipal Council by telephone to coordinate. (B) To avoid accidental losses, the plan to transport rice during curfew hours cannot be implemented because it conflicts with the office hours of the warehouses.

### The Guild Resolved to Lower Price Limits

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Guild held its 58th joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 4:00 p.m. yesterday, attended by Xing Zhigang, Chen Ziyi, Fu Qiangeng, Cao Xinggeng, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Jin Zhaoyun, Huang Zhihe, Zhu Xiangsheng, She Bingwen, Cai Shengming, Gu Yisheng, Zhang Lizhong, Jiang Hongbin, and Hu Wen'an, a representative of the rice market. Chairman Xing Zhigang reported on the cases to be discussed and gave a brief explanation of the recent rice market situation. Two important cases concerning the rice market were then passed as follows: (1) Discussing the case of further lowering the price limits for rice and grain: It was resolved to comply with the Municipal Council's intention that, starting from the 17th of this month, the highest price limit for domestic white rice must not exceed 40 yuan per shi, with prices decreasing progressively for medium and lower grades. The highest price limit for Ke Xian rice must not exceed 33 yuan per shi, with prices decreasing progressively for medium and lower grades. The prices of foreign rice are not subject to this rule due to fluctuating source costs, so that it can still be imported continuously to alleviate the food shortage when domestic rice is blocked.

### Calling on Authorities to Protect Rice Merchants

(II) Proposed letter to the authorities in the concessions requesting protection for legitimate rice merchants, resolved: Since the authorities in the concessions issued a proclamation stating that they would not protect hoarding merchants, there has been considerable misunderstanding in the outside world, leading to repeated disputes. Rice stores have experienced dozens of incidents of rice looting. Rice firms face dangers when selling goods, especially during delivery. Even sales of over a hundred bags, such as those by Dingxin Tai, have been suspected of hoarding. In such circumstances, all legitimate rice merchants are in danger. This affects not only the business of fellow traders but also the food supply of the entire city. It is necessary to write to the authorities in the concessions, requesting a detailed explanation of the meaning of hoarding for compliance. The association originally strongly supports public reporting, but we request a preliminary investigation and prudent handling. If there is indeed hoarding or manipulation, it should be severely punished; otherwise, it will easily lead to malicious accusations, harming the reputation of legitimate merchants, blurring right and wrong, and preventing effective protection to ensure business operations and maintain the food supply. It is also proposed to formulate and announce a notice on price limits, to be announced in the market today, for universal knowledge and strict compliance.

Rice Store Association's Emergency Meeting

The Shanghai Rice Store Trade Association held a temporary emergency executive and supervisory committee meeting at its clubhouse on Shanhai Guan Road yesterday at 3:00 PM. All committee members attended, with Lu Wenshao as chairman. The chairman first reported on the situation of the rice market and the results of his visit to the authorities. Then, various committee members offered their opinions separately. Subsequently, it was decided to appoint Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao, and Qu Zhenhua as three committee members to visit the police authorities in both concessions again, to strongly protect legitimate rice merchants, to maintain the entire rice market. It was also decided to continue the meeting this afternoon to discuss important cases. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. The three representatives immediately went to the police stations in both concessions to report everything and request effective protection to maintain the business of legitimate rice merchants.

Regulation Association to be Established Tomorrow

After the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and over thirty other organizations resolved to establish the Shanghai Civil Food Regulation Association, they nominated Yu Qiaqing and ten others as committee members to actively prepare. They also convened a preparatory committee meeting yesterday at noon, attended by Yu Qiaqing, Xu Jilun, Xi Yushu, Li Wenjie, Wang Yuqing, Gui Yanfang, Zhang Jiguang, etc. At the meeting, Li Wenjie and others were appointed to draft the charter and rules of procedure. It was resolved to appoint committee members to discuss with the banking industry about advancing funds and to find ways to raise funds in order to purchase foreign rice and carry out price stabilization. The association is scheduled to be established tomorrow.

Abnormal Market Trading Stalled

Yesterday's tea party market for the rice industry at Qinglian Pavilion on Fuzhou Road saw almost no transactions after the market opened at 9:00 AM. The market closed early at 11:00 AM, effectively halting operations. It is said that this was due to the recent rice looting incidents and the measures taken by the authorities in both concessions to register hoarders and punish unscrupulous merchants. Sellers were eager to sell off their goods as soon as possible, resulting in a glut of goods, while stores were afraid of accidents after purchasing, so they were unwilling to buy, resulting in no transactions. However, this matter has attracted the attention of the general public. Some people believe that this action by the rice market is an excuse. The reasons for this are highly unpredictable, because the proclamation of the concession authorities clearly states that those who engage in speculation and manipulation will be punished, while legitimate rice merchants are fully protected, and concrete measures have already been taken. Moreover, the authorities are curbing rice looting, and all sectors are actively planning to regulate the food supply and seek fundamental solutions. The market situation may be difficult, but it should not be stopped due to minor setbacks, leading to a halt in market transactions and increasing public panic. It is hoped that the rice industry will quickly come up with a solution.

### Movement for Integrity Most Encouraging for the Financial Sector

The integrity movement initiated by various sectors in the city has been expanding its publicity and actively promoting it in recent days, sparing no effort. It has deeply imprinted the concept of integrity in people's hearts, awakening them and achieving significant results. Yesterday was the fifth day of the publicity week, targeting the education sector. A letter to colleagues in the education sector was published, encouraging teachers to promote integrity, lead by example, guide young people, and promote the national spirit. Today is the sixth day of the movement, targeting the financial sector in Shanghai. While there are many far-sighted and conscious people in the financial sector, there are also many who only seek immediate gains and disregard the overall situation. They often use their large amounts of capital without thinking about investing in the interior to assist the country's economic construction, only knowing how to hoard in the isolated island, speculate and hoard, and monopolize prices, which is truly wrong. It is not only shameful to the nation but also betrays countless compatriots who are struggling hard. It is decided today to dedicate the exhortation to the financial sector in the city. In addition to distributing declarations and leaflets of the integrity movement, a letter urging the financial sector will be published, several thousand words long.

### News of British Warship Victory British Expatriates Excited Officers and Men of the Three Ships Involved Have Close Ties with Shanghai

The Zi Lin News reported that the British cruisers Exeter, Ajax, and Achilles fought the German pocket battleship Spee for two days and won, and took measures to prevent the Spee, now sheltering in Montevideo Harbor, from re-entering the sea. British expatriates in Shanghai expressed their admiration for the heroic fighting of the three British cruisers upon hearing the news yesterday. Moreover, the three ships and their officers and men who participated in the battle have close ties with Shanghai. Harwood, who commanded the three British cruisers, is the commander of the British American and West Indies Fleet. He is well-known in the British China Fleet and served as the commander and executive officer of the British warship Cumberland from 1928 to 1929. At that time, the commander of the ship was Colonel Snape (later promoted to Rear Admiral). Another coincidence is that after Harwood ordered the attack on the German warship Spee, he has now met his old friend Cumberland. Several British warships, including Cumberland, have sailed to Montevideo to reinforce the British fleet to wait for the Spee to sail out. Commander Harwood is very famous on the Chinese coast and is a torpedo expert.

### National Goods Company Employees Receive Pay Raise Subsidies Implemented Labor Dispute Resolved

Over eight hundred male and female employees of the three branches of the China National Goods Company on Nanjing Road went on strike to demand improved treatment from the management. The three branches were temporarily closed for two days. After continued negotiations between labor and management, and mediation by the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department, a satisfactory resolution was reached. The three branches resumed business at 9:00 AM yesterday. According to inquiries by reporters from the New Sound News Agency, the company's employee salaries are paid in two installments on the 15th and 30th of each month. The salary payment date for the first half of this month was delayed until yesterday due to the unresolved labor dispute. However, the employees' request for a pay increase of two yuan per person per month from January onwards was approved. As for employee subsidies, they will continue to be handled in accordance with the method determined by the management. Those with monthly salaries of two to five yuan will receive an additional two yuan if they live in company dormitories and three yuan if they live outside. Those with monthly salaries of six to nine yuan will receive an additional three or four yuan. Those with monthly salaries of ten to nineteen yuan will receive an additional four or five yuan. Those with monthly salaries of twenty to twenty-nine yuan will receive an additional five or six yuan. Those with monthly salaries of thirty to forty-nine yuan will receive an additional six or seven yuan. Those with monthly salaries of fifty to one hundred yuan will receive an additional seven or eight yuan. This will be implemented from this month.

### Prospects for Factories in the Eastern District Cause for Concern Discontent Among Workers is Growing

The Continental News reported that yesterday (the 15th), it was heard that discontent among workers in factories in the Eastern District is growing, and the "workers' organizations" controlled by the Japanese are increasingly active among the laborers in the Eastern District. Regarding these "workers' organizations," further details were learned yesterday. The organization is located at 127 Yangguang Road and is officially named the "China Workers' Welfare Association." The official leader is a Chinese man surnamed Mo (transliteration) who is controlled by a Korean or Taiwanese man named Lang Qizhong (transliteration). Above Lang is Kubota, a retired colonel of the Japanese Army, who controls everything.

### Cotton Yarn Detained on Manley Wheel Association Requests Inspection

The British merchant ship Shirley Wheel sailed to Wenzhou without approval, importing goods without authorization, violating regulations. The Wenzhou military authorities imposed a penalty of 30% on the goods on board. It is now heard that the cotton yarn transported to Wenzhou by two yarn companies, Zhu Guiji and Sui Feng, members of the Shanghai Yarn Industry Association, has also been penalized. However, the ship failed to obtain import approval, which is the responsibility of the British ship. How can the cargo owner be fined? A letter was sent to the City Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the Military Affairs Commission, the Commander-in-Chief of the Third War Zone, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, requesting that an urgent order be issued to inspect and release the goods, to avoid punishing the innocent.

### Iron Gate at Xin Kaihe Continued to Open Yesterday Notice that the Walkway Has Been Changed to South Side Entrance and Exit No Sign of Other Iron Gates Opening

The iron gate connecting Xin Kaihe to the South City has been on trial opening since the 11th. After six days of smooth passage, it will continue to be opened. There is no sign of opening the iron gates at Lao Bei Men and other places, as it is still under consideration. The details are as follows:

Iron Gate Closed, Walkway Changed

Since the iron gate connecting Xin Kaihe to the South City began its trial opening on the 11th, over 20,000 residents have passed through. As the passage has been relatively smooth, it will continue to be opened from yesterday. However, the small doors on both sides of the previously opened iron gate have been causing crowding and difficulty in maintaining order. Therefore, the passage location has been changed to the channel on the south side of the fire brigade, in front of the door. The iron gate on the north side has been completely closed.

Implementation of Inspection, Good Order

The new passage on the south side is also equipped with wire mesh and divided into import and export lanes. Residents entering and exiting are still crowded. In terms of order, French Concession detectives and female inspectors are selectively inspecting suspicious individuals, with good results and no disturbances. Therefore, the French Municipal Council has decided to continue opening the gate to facilitate residents' entry and exit.

Other Iron Gates Not Opened

There is no sign of opening the other iron gates connected to the South City in the French Concession, as they are still under consideration. It is said that the Xin Kaihe gate alone is sufficient for passage, and the French Concession authorities have no intention of opening other iron gates for the time being. According to reporters from the Datong News Agency who inspected the iron gates at Xin Bei Men, Lao Bei Men, Nanyang Bridge, and other areas yesterday, in addition to the usual closure, the iron gates were densely covered with wire mesh, and armed police, detectives, and French soldiers were stationed there. The situation was extremely quiet.

### Rice Looting Spreads

Rice looting has intensified in recent days. Initially, it was prevalent only in the Shanghai West area, but yesterday it spread to the concessions. The situation is as follows: (Public Concession) Rice stores at No. 100 Kaifeng Road, No. 15 Chengdu Road, No. 66 and No. 191 Dagu Road, No. 33 and No. 340 Shanhai Guan Road, No. 389 Baker Road, various Dazhonghua rice stores, and locations on Robert Road, Carter Road, Guanchang Road, and Jiaozhou Road all experienced rice looting incidents. (French Concession) The Dingtai rice store at No. 1111 Pushi Road suffered the greatest loss, with over a hundred sentences of white rice looted. Other rice stores, such as Yilong rice store at the intersection of Lafeyette Road and Caishi Road, Gongda rice store at the intersection of Albert Road and Fuxu Road, a certain rice store at No. 387 Jujida Road, and a certain rice store on Ganshi Dong Road, as well as Chang on Pingjihe Road and Dajiang on Ladu Road, were all robbed of varying amounts of white rice. A total of eighteen rice looting incidents were reported yesterday, with approximately eight hundred piculs looted. The accurate number of rice looting incidents that occurred the day before yesterday (the 15th) was thirty-six, with sixty-two people detained and a total of one thousand three hundred dan robbed. Statistics show that a total of fifty-four incidents occurred over two days, with two thousand one hundred dan looted and one hundred twelve people arrested.

Selling at Discounted Prices

Yifeng Rice Store, next door to Huayuanli on Bailinan Road, had over ten poor people attempting to break into the rice store yesterday morning. A certain employee, Mr. Jia, was very alert and said to the owner, "This store has a total of twenty-eight piculs of rice. Why not sell it at a low price to help the poor?" The owner agreed and sold it to the poor at twenty-eight yuan per picul (both indica rice and national rice were priced the same). In the blink of an eye, it was sold out. When the general public heard of this low market price, they flocked to various stores in Shanghai West to buy, but to no avail. As a result, the general public was extremely angry and almost resorted to rice looting again. The owners of various rice stores in Shanghai West, in view of this, convened a meeting at Hengyi Public Rice Store, No. 1105 Jisi Fei Er Road, at 1:00 PM yesterday. Over forty representatives attended to discuss effective ways to suppress rice prices. They unanimously agreed to standardize market prices, with the highest price for foreign rice not exceeding thirty-six yuan and the highest price for national rice not exceeding thirty-eight yuan. Those who violate the resolution will be severely punished. Huang Zhihe was appointed as the representative to report and file the resolution with the Shanghai Rice and Vegetable Trade Association and the Market Management Committee.

Police on Alert

After the rice looting occurred, all rice stores, large and small, in the French Concession closed, leaving only a small hole for small-scale transactions by ordinary people. The French Concession Police Department immediately ordered all police stations to order detectives to remain stationed in the police stations after the shift and not to leave without authorization, in case of an emergency to suppress the riots. It also ordered all patrol teams and armored vehicles to step up patrols to maintain order. Patrols on foot and in vehicles inspected each rice store in the concession every fifteen minutes to prevent rice looting from happening again.

The Continental News reported that Bowen, the Superintendent of the Public Concession Police Department, criticized the rice looting situation in the city last night (the 15th), saying that these disturbances may have been initiated by hooligans. The rice looting riots only occurred several days after the highest rice price of forty-eight yuan per dan had passed, and there were no riots when the rice price was at its highest. Robson, the Assistant Superintendent of the Police Department responsible for handling the rice situation, stated that the number of rice looting riots is not expected to increase significantly, and the Police Department is quite capable of handling the current situation. From today (the 16th), police officers in both concessions will adopt special patrol alerts in the rice store areas. In the Public Concession, almost all Chinese detectives will be stationed in the rice stores, while in the French Concession, patrol officers with light machine guns will patrol each rice store at regular intervals. Rice stores in both concessions will close at 5:00 PM every day.

Rice Merchant Assassinated

Shen Shangwen, a local resident, 63 years old, residing in the Weihe Sauce Garden at No. 145 Zhejiang Road, is engaged in the rice business and is one of the six major rice dealers in the city. He established the Yuande Rice Store at No. 145. Yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, Shen took his private chartered car to go out, intending to go to the Qinglian Pavilion rice industry market at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Hubei Road to conduct his daily buying and selling transactions. Unexpectedly, when the car reached a small vegetable market on Fuzhou Road, two assassins suddenly jumped out from the roadside, stopped Shen's car, and one of them took out a pistol and shot at Shen, firing two shots in a row. One bullet hit Shen's left shoulder and went through his back, and the other bullet hit his foot. He immediately fell into the car. Seeing that their purpose had been achieved, the two assassins quickly fled. By the time nearby police officers heard the alarm and arrived, they had already disappeared. Shen Shangwen was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment, where doctors performed surgery. The injuries were not critical, and there was probably no major problem. The police station is strictly pursuing the perpetrators. However, after the incident, the general speculators in the Qinglian Pavilion rice market felt extremely uneasy.

### Workers at Ewo and Xiang Mao Resume Work Yesterday

The labor strike at the Ewo Cold Storage at No. 5555 Yangshupu Road and the Xiang Mao Soap Factory at No. 2310 Yangshupu Road has been resolved. Workers at both factories resumed work yesterday morning. However, workers at the Ewo Brewery at No. 350 Dinghai Road and the Swiss Shanghua Aluminum Steel Refining Factory at No. 610 Meizhou Road are still on strike.

### Ms. Mao Liying's Remains to be Encoffined Today Yesterday, Various Circles Went to Pay Their Respects to Her Remains He Xiangning and Others Sent Representatives to Shanghai to Offer Condolences

Ms. Mao Liying, Chairman of the Chinese Professional Women's Club, was suddenly attacked by two thugs near Sichuan Road on Nanjing Road at 7:00 PM on the 12th of this month, suffering serious injuries. She eventually died of ineffective treatment at 2:12 PM the day before yesterday. Friends and people from all walks of life believe that Ms. Mao devoted herself to social work during her lifetime and made great contributions to disaster relief. Therefore, the news of her death was extremely painful for all sectors. It is not only a loss to society but also a great loss to the country. Ms. Mao's friends and people from all walks of life have formed a funeral committee to handle everything.

Various Circles Sent Wreaths and Funeral Couplets

Ms. Mao's remains were examined by the coroner's office the night before last and sent to the Universal Funeral Home yesterday. Technicians at the funeral home performed makeup, and a public viewing was held at 2:00 PM yesterday. Over seven hundred people from all walks of life attended, and the funeral was extremely solemn. A large number of wreaths, couplets, and condolences were also sent. The couplets included "Exhausted Benevolence and Wisdom" from McLane High School and "Sacrificing Oneself for Righteousness" from Shanghai Women's Organizations. Those who sent wreaths included the YWCA, colleagues from the Jianghai Customs, Qixiu Girls' School, the Chinese Women's Mutual Aid Association, colleagues from the Shanghai professional community, the Shanghai All Circles Friendship Association, and individuals. Ms. He Xiangning specially sent representatives from Hong Kong to Shanghai to offer condolences and presented a condolence gift of one hundred yuan. Qian Xinzhi, Du Yuesheng, Huang Renzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Wu Shaowu, and others also sent representatives to Shanghai to offer condolences or sent couplets and condolence gifts by telegram.

Encoffined in Accordance with Religious Rituals

Ms. Mao's remains are scheduled to be encoffined at 2:30 PM today. Because Ms. Mao was a devout Christian during her lifetime, the encoffining will be held in accordance with Christian rituals, and a pastor will come to preside. It is heard that the procedure for the encoffining will begin with the pastor praying for Ms. Mao's remains, followed by a farewell ceremony from all circles. It is also heard that permanent memorial measures from all circles are being discussed. Ms. Mao's coffin will be temporarily placed in the Universal Funeral Home until the funeral at 1:00 PM on the 18th of this month, when she will be buried in the Hongqiao Municipal Council Cemetery.

### Japanese Man Who Assaulted Police Sergeant Still Needs to be Summoned for Questioning

The three Japanese men (now known to include one Taiwanese) who assaulted a British police sergeant at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road on the evening of the 13th were taken to the Japanese Consulate Police Station after being detained. They were released after being admonished by the Japanese Police Station. However, after their release, they still need to be summoned at any time. According to inquiries by reporters from the Dazhong News Agency yesterday, the Japanese Police Station has notified the police station authorities to provide written proof and requested the injured police sergeant, Mr. Jin, to accompany the British Army West Force Highlands soldier Stevens and the Public Works Department inspector McNeill, who rescued Mr. Jin at the scene, to testify at the Japanese Consulate Court after he recovers. They said that the two Japanese men and one Taiwanese man who caused the trouble would be prosecuted for assaulting public officials.

### Dredging Bureau Dredging No Definite Date Restoration After Two Years of Suspension Full of Twists and Turns

The English-language Great Beauty Evening News reported that the Japanese authorities had previously announced that the Dredging Bureau would resume work on December 1, and then announced that work would resume on January 1. This reporter asked customs officials this morning (the 16th) about the possibility of this. Their opinions were divided. According to a customs official, dredging work cannot begin until January 15 at the earliest because the Dredging Bureau's equipment has not been used for more than two years and therefore needs to be greatly refurbished. Another customs official said that since the Japanese authorities have agreed to assist in restoring dredging, work should be able to begin by the end of this year. Li Jiannan, the "Jianghai Customs Supervisor" appointed by the Nanjing government, refused to disclose any definite date for the Dredging Bureau to resume work, but said that he hoped to begin work "soon."

### Two Chinese Detectives to be Released Tomorrow

Two Chinese detectives, Sun Peihe and Xu Jianbi, who were performing their duties at the intersection of Robert Road and Binglang Road in the Public Concession on the 19th of last month, were detained by the Japanese military police due to a conflict with a puppet official. The Concession authorities were quite concerned about this matter. Later, the Japanese side transferred the two Chinese detectives to the pseudo "Shanghai West Court." Yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 PM, the pseudo court interrogated them without authorization. The pseudo official who caused the incident and the Japanese military police were all present. Eventually, it was "announced that the two Chinese detectives were not guilty" because they were performing their duties in accordance with the law and there was nothing wrong with them. However, since today is a Sunday, they are scheduled to be released tomorrow.

### Chen Xianzhang Kidnapped

Chen Xianzhang, from Yuyao, Zhejiang, 34 years old, once served in a social organization. Last night at around 9:00 PM, an old friend suddenly invited him to the Shalivan Tea House on Nanjing Road. When Chen Ying responded to the invitation and walked to the front of Shalivan, he found that his old friend was already waiting there. Immediately, he and Chen boarded a car and sped northeast. Someone witnessed a total of three cars parked there at the time, with several strong men standing by, which seemed to be a planned action.

### Two Liners Arrive in Shanghai Today

The Changxing Company's liner Empress of Russia is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Little Luzon via Hong Kong at 5:30 PM today, docking at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf. Passengers will transfer to small boats and land at the new customs house at 6:30 PM today. The liner is scheduled to leave Shanghai tonight, heading to Japan and returning to Canada. The passenger ferry is scheduled to depart from the new customs wharf at 9:30 PM tonight. The Java Mail Line's ship Cibadak will arrive in Shanghai from Surabaya today, docking at Qichang Wharf in Pudong. The import time has not yet been determined and is expected to be confirmed this morning.

### An Interesting Journey from Changsha to Ningbo

Dr. Geling, Acting Principal of Xiangya Pharmaceutical College in Changsha, recently arrived in Shanghai and described to a reporter from the North-China Daily News the details of his journey from Changsha to Ningbo. The trip covered 950 miles and was accomplished by car, boat, and rickshaw in just seven short days. The journey was filled with exciting and extraordinary events.

Traveling Down the Xiang River

Dr. Geling set off from Changsha at the end of October, heading south to Xiangtan. Because the roads in that area were damaged, he had to travel down the Xiang River. The main channels of the river had been carefully laid with mines by the Chinese army, but the dangerous locations were clearly marked with tall flagpoles extending above the water's surface. Vessels dispatched by the central government were stationed at the ends of the minefields to prevent boats from entering the dangerous zones.

In the Autumn Sunshine

On the second day of his journey, Dr. Geling continued in the warm autumn sunshine, sailing from Xiangtan to Lukou, passing through several scenic and mountainous rural areas. About an hour from Xiangtan, Dr. Geling came to the "graveyard" of boats, where he saw sailboats, sampans, and motorboats stranded on sandbars, most of them completely destroyed. These boats were apparently wrecked after drifting downstream and running aground.

From Lukou to Hengyang

After arriving at Lukou, Dr. Geling had his luggage unloaded and boarded a midnight train to Hengyang. There were still quite a few trains running on the railway. The one he took to Hengyang was a blue steel carriage formerly used on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Upon arriving in Hengyang, Dr. Geling joined Mr. Burke, and they traveled together by car. They bought a five-gallon can of gasoline for fifty yuan and arranged the back of the car for sleeping. They set off on a clear Saturday afternoon for Chaling, 126 miles away. They parked by the roadside at night to sleep and started driving again at dawn, arriving in Chaling, where they bought a well-cooked breakfast consisting of rice, eggs, peanuts, and tea for only thirty cents. After breakfast, they resumed driving.

From Hunan into Jiangxi

Upon crossing the border from Hunan into Jiangxi, there was a checkpoint, but Dr. Geling and his companion were quite surprised that their car wasn't even stopped. They drove straight into Jiangxi. There were several policemen stationed at the checkpoint, but they paid no attention to the travelers. The area was also a long-distance bus station because passengers had to change buses when traveling from one province to another. Long-distance buses from Hunan were not allowed to operate in Jiangxi, and vice versa.

Spending a Night in Xingguo

For the hundred miles east of the border, the road ran through a narrow valley, and the road surface was excellent, making travel easy. The roadside was quite desolate. Starting from Hengyang, they traveled for a day and arrived at the bustling small city of Ji'an around noon on Sunday. Although the city had been slightly bombed, it had recovered, and business was thriving. Dr. Geling and Burke bought a five-gallon can of gasoline in Ji'an for forty-five yuan. They set off from Ji'an and drove in the rain to the small town of Xingguo. As dusk fell, eight or nine young Chinese men with flashlights approached, holding cards for inns. Several of them spoke English fluently and claimed that the inn they represented was the best. Dr. Geling and Burke eventually looked around and chose a brand-new inn to stay in. They later learned that the innkeeper had previously run an inn in Nanchang and now established inns in various towns along the highway.

People in a Painting

After resting for a night in Xingguo, Dr. Geling and Mr. Burke continued on to Ningdu, traveling through newly opened roads in a mountainous rural area. Although the bright sunshine gradually dried the accumulated rainwater from the previous day, the road was still difficult to navigate, especially on the slopes. They drove along the road past steep cliffs made of black and white sandstone. Dr. Geling said that the captivating scenery of the area was unlike anything he had ever seen before.

Everywhere, There Were Coal Blocks

After a while, they drove past a granite mountain and witnessed a very astonishing sight. The road was opened through a large coal seam, and there were coal blocks even on the road surface. People carelessly threw this black mineral to the roadside. The engineers who built the road were too busy and had no time to pay attention to the coal blocks that were dug up when the new road was opened. Moreover, the area was quite backward, so coal blocks were not valued and were discarded by the roadside for several miles. This example vaguely reminded people of China's undeveloped rich mineral deposits.

After the quiet mountains, a towering and solitary mountain suddenly appeared. The mountain was a light color and stood tall into the clouds. The faint color was not due to snow but to some kind of substance flowing freely from the peak, covering one-third of the mountain. The mountain seemed to have been mined. The two travelers stopped and talked to a farmer who happened to be passing by. The farmer told them that the top of the mountain was made of limestone, and this type of stone had been mined for hundreds of years. The old roads on the hillside used hundreds of years ago were still clearly visible. In recent years, dynamite had been used to mine limestone. Workers used dynamite to blast, and the large stones rolled freely down the slope.

Car Almost Caused Disaster

Dr. Geling finally continued driving and arrived in Ningdu, stopping at the church. Ningdu itself was not affected by the war. Many sugar canes were planted in the suburbs. The two stayed at the church for a while and then drove north to Yingtan. When they arrived near the city at midnight and were about to drive over the railway bridge, the car slipped sideways, and one wheel slid off the bridge, almost causing an accident. Fortunately, they stopped in time. As the two were thinking about how to get the car back on the road, a group of Chinese arrived. They claimed to have taken refuge in the area from Nanchang, but they seemed to be well-nourished. Dr. Geling gave them a small reward, and they found wooden planks and managed to get the car back on the road.

Heard Air Raid Alert

The two drove on to Yingtan and left Yingtan the next day. They arrived in Shangrao for breakfast in the morning. Although the city was small, it was quite prosperous. The two found a restaurant and enjoyed a fine breakfast of ham and eggs. They also bought gasoline in Raozhou for thirty-five yuan per five gallons. As they were about to finish filling the gasoline, an air raid alert sounded. They jumped into the car and quickly drove out of the city to take temporary refuge. Looking back, they saw soldiers on the city walls also taking refuge in shelters for safety. Dr. Geling and others continued to drive along the highway and saw that the grains around the city were particularly abundant, and many rice paddies were planted nearby.

Xikou Reception Center

They then entered Zhejiang from Jiangxi and stopped in Jinhua. However, they heard another alert before entering the city and had to stay outside the city until dusk. They bought some gasoline again in the morning for twenty-five yuan per five gallons. They drove to the lovely small town of Xikou. The town was prosperous because it was an overnight stop on the journey. There were several large hotels in the town, one of which was operated by the China Travel Service. There were also China Travel Service reception centers in many places along the road, maintaining a standard of prescribed prices and facilities.

Never Saw a Single Soldier

The two handed over the car in Xikou to someone returning west and then set off for Ningbo. For the first three hours, they traveled by rickshaw and then changed to a boat to Ningbo, a distance of ten kilometers costing four yuan. But they soon discovered that traveling by the regular riverboat between Xikou and Ningbo cost only twenty cents and was faster. Dr. Geling arrived in Ningbo, completing his 950-mile journey. They never saw a single soldier along the way. Of course, the two avoided the war zones, but it was quite remarkable that such a vast area was never touched by the Japanese army. Dr. Geling plans to spend a short time in Shanghai and then return to Changsha by the same route.

### Falsely Impersonating a Name to Intimidate and Defraud a Copper and Tin Shop Owner, Sending Two Letters and Threatening by Telephone, Detectives Design to Arrest Multiple Criminals Successively

Shen Rongchun, the owner of Shen Gui Ji Copper and Tin Shop at No. 816 Beijing Road, received a threatening letter delivered on the morning of the 3rd of this month. The letter was signed by the "General Headquarters of the Shanghai Youth Anti-Japanese Iron-Blood Punishing Traitors Group". The gist of the letter was that the headquarters lacked military pay and requested a subsidy of 5,000 yuan, to be delivered to the French Park on the afternoon of the 3rd. However, Shen Rongchun was not in Shanghai at the time, so the shop assistants ignored it. Afterwards, the bandits repeatedly called Shen Gui Ji, and the shop assistants told them that the owner was not in Shanghai and that they could request a subsidy from the trade association. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 14th, another bandit delivered a letter to Shen Gui Ji. The bandit held an object that looked like a hand grenade. Upon inspection by the people in the shop, it was found that the letter continued the request of the previous letter, and the time was still in the French Park on the afternoon of the same day. However, Shen and others still ignored it. Afterwards, the bandits repeatedly threatened by telephone and arranged to pay the money in front of the Golden Grand Theater on the morning of the previous day. Shen then reported to the Old Gate Patrol Room. Chief Detective Yun A Gen ordered Detective Xu Fusheng to investigate. The next day, Chinese detectives Zhang Keqin, Shen Tianbao, Ding Yizhong, and detectives Zhang Xingyan and Cao Qishan were dispatched and disguised themselves to wait in front of the Golden Gate. Soon, a Ningbo native, Wu Genfa, came to contact the detectives and was arrested and taken back to the patrol room. It was found that Wu and others had previously made phone calls to Shen Rongchun from the Zhongxing Garden Restaurant at No. 1372 Robison Road, which proved that they often gathered at the

restaurant to discuss. So he took the Wu suspect to Juxing Garden and asked Wu to write a request for guests to summon his accomplices. Soon, Ningbo natives Wang A Qing, Zhang Xuemei, Mao Kecheng, and Lin Genhe came, and they were all captured by the detectives. Later, a Ningbo native, Fang Zhongcheng, was arrested at Longgong Hotel at No. 63 Kaizi'er Road, and Yang Haibiao was arrested at No. 77 Maidiean Road. It was found that this case was initiated by Lin Genhe, because Lin had worked at Shen Gui Ji for many years and knew everything about Shen Gui Ji. The

threatening group was led by Wu Genfa, and Zhang Xuemei was responsible for delivering the second threatening letter. Later, detectives went to Tingqianjian at No. 12 Shandong Road and seized a wooden stamp of the "Shanghai Youth Anti-Japanese Iron-Blood Punishing Traitors Group". Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the Special Court. The patrol room lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the previous situation and filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 346 of the Criminal Law, requesting permission to change the date in order to continue to arrest the fugitives, which was approved by Judge Xiao Xiefei and ordered all defendants to be detained and rescheduled for trial.

### Japanese and Korean Gambling, Continuing to Plan to Ban Gambling Dens

According to the agency, after the Japanese side successively banned the gambling dens in Hongkou and Zhabei Dafeng, it is now heard that the Japanese side is still planning to further reduce the gambling dens in the western part of Shanghai, because there are too many gambling dens in one corner of the area, which easily causes incidents, and there have been many theft cases recently. For the sake of security, it is necessary to ban them to limit them. It is understood that it will be implemented within days. The Songyuan at No. 626 Haig Road, the Qiuyuan at No. 15 Jessfield Road, and the Hollywood gambling den on Yuyuan Road will all be revoked their certificates and banned from business. At the same time, the Japanese side has now posted notices in front of each gambling den by the Supervision Department, absolutely prohibiting Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese people from entering the gambling den for gambling.

### Embezzling Huge Sums of Money, Fleeing with Prostitutes, Tianjin Commercial Bank Files a Complaint, Xu Yiqin and Rong Prostitutes are Sent to the Court Together

Xu Yiqin, also known as Xinmin, a native of Yantai, Shandong, the deputy director of business at the Tianjin Commercial Bank (formerly misreported as a bank) in the Tianjin French Concession, is thirty years old this year. Because he stole a huge amount of more than 40,000 yuan in national currency from the bank, he fled to Shanghai with the prostitute Rong Ruizhen (also known as Lao Qi, seventeen years old, a native of Suzhou) on the Taikoo Company's Hubei ship. After the bank discovered it, it reported to the Tianjin French Patrol Room and telegraphed the Shanghai French Police Department, requesting interception. The French Patrol Room of this city, upon receiving the telegram, dispatched Inspector Xie Guangming, Detectives Wang Ronggui, Wang Dongwan, Wu Lianrong, and Detective Jin Bingwen to wait at the Taikoo Wharf on the afternoon of the 29th of last month when the Hubei ship arrived. They immediately boarded the ship and searched it, arresting Xu and the prostitute Rong together, and seizing 3,200 US dollars, which were taken back to the patrol room for detention and telegraphed to the Hejin French Patrol Room for investigation. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Tianjin French Patrol Room has telegraphed the Shanghai French Patrol Room to transfer the case to Shanghai for handling, and Lu Xinshang, the manager of Tianjin Commercial Bank, and Yang Fuchen, a detective from the Tianjin French Patrol Room, came to Shanghai and filed a complaint with the French Patrol Room, requesting investigation. Yesterday afternoon, the patrol room sent the defendants Xu Yiqin and Rong Ruizhen to the Criminal Court of the Special Court. The patrol room lawyer Gu Shouxii said that the defendant Xu Yiqin was arrested for embezzling a huge amount of money in business and fleeing to Shanghai with a prostitute. He requested detention and a one-week postponement to investigate and then sue for trial. Then, Detective Jin Bingwen reported the process of arresting the defendant. According to the plaintiff Lu Xinshang, the defendant managed the funds to and from the same industry in the bank. He used the convenience of his position to withdraw 2,000 yuan in legal currency from Qingfeng Bank, 25,000 yuan from Defeng Bank, 15,000 yuan from Yifeng Bank, and 1,000 yuan from Zhiyuan Bank, totaling 43,000 yuan. Later, he entrusted Tongyi Company to buy 3,100 US dollars on behalf of the bank. When the bank discovered it, Xu had already taken the prostitute on a ship to Shanghai, so he immediately reported it to the patrol room and telegraphed the Shanghai patrol room for interception. When asked about Xu, he confessed that he was confused for a while and stole a huge amount of money to flee, but the money was not used and the travel expenses were his own savings. Judge Miao Qingbang checked the confession and ordered a postponement of the trial to the 21st of this month. The defendants were detained.

Since the price of fuel coal has soared, restaurants, hotels, and eateries have all been greatly affected and have raised prices one after another. Yesterday, all hot water industries (i.e., public bathhouses) in the city also jointly announced a price increase of 50%, changing from ten wen per ladle to fifteen wen per ladle, and also announced, "The price of coal has skyrocketed and we will be forced to close down. We will temporarily increase prices, which has been decided by the industry to maintain our capital and relieve our immediate needs. We hope for the understanding of all sectors." (According to the industry, three ladles were sold for ten wen before the war, two ladles after the war, and one ladle was changed to one wen in October. In two years, the price has increased nearly five times, setting the highest record for price increases.) At the same time, tea houses have also raised prices by one or two cents each due to the coal price. Other small food and snack shops have either increased prices or reduced ingredients to compensate. The livelihoods of ordinary people are increasingly difficult.

### Grain, The Time When Foreign Rice Is in Demand, Rice Shops Are Involuntarily Closed

Only a Little Trading in Small Bazaars, No Goods Are Sold to Rice Markets, High-Quality White Japonica Rice Is Limited to 40 Yuan

Since the price of rice has soared, ordinary people (not just the poor) have difficulty getting food and are all in desperate need. Due to the rice rush that spread over the past two days, rice shops all closed their doors yesterday and stopped doing business. Some shops continued to trade as usual in small bazaars, which was a great inconvenience to the common people. Since the rice shops were effectively closed, they did not sell rice to the market, so the rice market was also effectively closed and closed at 10:30 a.m. without any transactions. It is said that the closure of the rice shops was to prevent robbery, but it also had side effects and was intended to restore the old state. This is related to the people's food and cannot be taken lightly.

Yesterday, 1,600 to 1,700 bags of foreign rice from Jiangxi, Beijing, and Anhui arrived. More goods are expected to arrive in Shanghai one after another. However, the merchants have stopped buying for a long time, and the shops are afraid to add goods after the rice rush. The sellers are very eager to sell, but there was no showing in the involuntary closure yesterday, so only a few hundred bags were traded all day. Jiangxi rice was opened at 33 yuan to 32 yuan, which was a small decrease of a few cents to nearly one yuan compared to before.

The orders for foreign rice are arriving in succession. There is no agreement on new transactions. Only a few hundred bags of spot goods were sold in the involuntary closure yesterday. Saigon was 33 to 34 yuan, and 31 yuan 8 jiao to 31 yuan and a half, which was a small decrease of a few jiao to one yuan compared to the previous day. There was no trading in transit goods.

Yesterday, another 9,000 bags of foreign rice were imported, which were transported by the Taikoo Company's Qiongzhou ship. Among them, 1,002 bags were loaded from Saigon and 8,138 bags were loaded from Hong Kong. The ship docked at the company's wharf in the French Concession for unloading. It is heard that the Suzhou and Nanning ships arriving in Shanghai next week will also transport large quantities of foreign rice. (Zu)

At 4:00 p.m. yesterday, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association held its 58th joint meeting of directors and supervisors. It was decided to invite the intention of the Engineering Bureau that the maximum price of white japonica rice should not exceed 40 yuan in legal currency per stone, and the intermediate price should be reduced successively. The maximum price of foreign rice should not exceed 33 yuan in legal currency per stone, and the intermediate price should be reduced successively.

### Dull Trade in Flour and Wheat

Flour Yesterday, the trade in spot flour was dull. Because it was the weekend, both local and foreign customers were digesting slowly. The Hakka helpers mostly adopted the same cage goods. It is heard that the price of Green Cannon carriages is still 9 yuan, and the rest are also 2 to 3 jiao higher than the factory price. Less than 30,000 bags were traded in the general market. There were not many trades in Japanese Phoenix brand flour, and the sellers insisted on the price. The price for December is 8 yuan 2 jiao 4 to 5 fen, and the price for January is 6 jiao 7 to 8 fen.

Wheat The trade was also not prosperous yesterday. The source of goods is still scarce, and the market price has reached a peak of 15 yuan. The price is inevitably too high. It is heard that the highest price of wheat from Suzhou and Wuxi is still 15 yuan, while the price of intermediate-grade goods has slightly decreased. About 3,000 bags were traded. 1,000 to 2,000 bags were also sent directly to the factory.

### Miscellaneous Grains, It Is Said That the Arrival of Soybeans Was Blocked Again

Yesterday, after most of the soybeans that had been detained were released, there were small trading days for two consecutive days. But until yesterday, it was rumored on the market that the vehicles were blocked again, which made people turn firm. As a result, the price of high-quality goods was raised by a small amount. According to statistics, the port helper traded 300 bags of Pudong Du soybeans for 19 yuan and 7 to 8 jiao. The street office bought two vehicles of Nanjing soybeans for 17 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, 200 bags of Wuhu soybeans for 18 yuan and 5 jiao, and more than 180 bags of Chongming sand soybeans for 19 yuan and 1 jiao and a half and 18 yuan.

### Financial - The Exchange Market is Mediocre

Yesterday’s foreign exchange market saw no movement in HSBC’s listed rates. The informal British and American exchange market was quiet due to the weekend, with operators generally taking a wait-and-see attitude. The half-day situation remained calm, trending tight initially then receding, ultimately ending slightly firmer than the previous day. In the morning, the British-American exchange rate was reported to have shrunk, causing the opening to show a weak British pound and a stable US dollar. Subsequently, due to frequent settlements by foreign firms, and foreign banks such as HSBC seizing the opportunity to raise prices to cover demand, a slightly weaker state appeared. The British pound reached 4 shillings, 5 pence, 625 points, and the US dollar reached 7 yuan, 46 cents, 875 points.  Soon, fewer buyers appeared, and because foreign banks, such as HSBC, Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, and a certain other bank, were still eager to supply, the situation reversed to become slightly firmer.  At noon, under stabilized conditions, the market closed with the British pound at 4 shillings, 5 pence, 9375 points, and the US dollar at 7 yuan, 53 cents, 125 points, each weaker by 0.03125 compared to the previous day. As for futures trends, they were no different from the spot market.  Midway through the day, there were rumors of December-January swap trading, with HSBC bidding 0.09375 US dollars against a certain Chinese bank, for a combined monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of slightly more than 1.2%, although arbitrageurs realistically only saw about 0.8% to 0.9%.

Swap Trading Was Infrequent

In the early morning, London telegraphic transfers (TT) were flat for both near and far dates, and the New York silver price remained unchanged. The London spot gold price was steady.  The exchange rates of the British pound against the US dollar and the French franc were flat, while against Shanghai, it increased by 0.025. The US dollar decreased by 0.0375 against the British pound, decreased by 0.15 yuan against Shanghai, and decreased by a small 0.025 against the French franc.  The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same.  The opening selling prices of spot rates at banks were 4 shillings, 5 pence, 78125 points for the British pound, and 7.5 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was weaker by 0.05625, while the US dollar was unchanged, due to the decline in the exchange rate. Trading was thin after the opening, and the market was extremely stagnant.  The announcement of HSBC's listed rates caused no movement, and the announcement of the silver equalization tax also caused no increase or decrease.  Afterward, foreign firms started to settle, but fortunately, foreign banks like HSBC still had a good willingness to supply, so the situation, although tight, was extremely slight. Foreign firms settled with HSBC and Chartered Bank for spot Central Bank gold at 4 shillings, 5 pence, 625 points, while the US dollar also weakened to 7 yuan, 46 cents, 875 points.  Soon after, Banque Belge pour l'Étranger and a certain other bank were very eager to sell, supplying the same Dutch and Chinese banks with January US dollars at 7 yuan, 375 points, thus bringing the process back to equilibrium.  Subsequently, although foreign firms continued to settle, the supply from foreign banks was even greater, and the situation turned slightly firmer. Foreign banks such as HSBC sold spot US dollars to foreign firms at 7 yuan, 53 cents, 125 points. At that time, there was a sudden rumor of a small number of swap trades, with HSBC bidding 0.09375 US dollars against a certain Chinese bank, for a combined monthly interest rate of slightly more than 1.2%.  Transactions became increasingly thin at noon, and the underlying trend became more calm.  Extending to the noon close, the bank's spot selling price was 4 shillings, 5 pence, 9375 points for the British pound, and 7 yuan, 53 cents, 125 points for the US dollar.  The current month's British pound was 4 shillings, 5 pence, 78125 points, and the US dollar was 7 yuan, 56 cents, 25 points.  The January British pound was 4 shillings, 5 pence, 625 points, and the US dollar was 7 yuan, 40 cents, 625 points. As a result, compared to the previous day, the spot British and American exchange rates each weakened by 0.03125.  There will be no market on Saturday afternoon.

Hong Kong Exchange Market Unchanged

Hong Kong, 16th - This morning's exchange market opened flat, with all exchange rates unchanged from yesterday's close.  At 11:30 AM, the market was stable, with no changes in market conditions.  There will be no market on Saturday afternoon.

Tianjin Exchange Rate Continues to Tighten

Tianjin, 16th - The exchange market opened flat this morning. Compared to yesterday's opening, the spot British pound tightened by 0.0625 to 4 shillings, 2 pence, 125 points.  The spot US dollar shrank by 0.125 to 7 yuan, 0625 points. The Shanghai tael rose by 1.5 yuan to 105 yuan.  The unofficial "Joint Banknotes" rebounded by 1.25 yuan to 94.25 yuan.

### Gold Market Calm - Half-Day Trading Approximately One Thousand Yuan

Yesterday's cash raw gold unofficial market situation was such that because the exchange market was easing, coupled with the fact that the Hong Kong gold price, the only outlet, was not as robust as in the previous two days, and due to the weekend, general long positions weakened, and there was a strong desire to close out positions.  As a result, the price fell by a small 19 yuan. However, the morning opening carried over the previous night's momentum, continuing to rise by 10 yuan, to a high price of 4,190 yuan.  Shortly after, a certain money exchange business took advantage of the high price to aggressively sell, and the situation suddenly weakened, falling by 20 yuan. At that time, the foreign exchange market was slightly tight, and the market briefly stabilized, but soon the exchange market hardened, and securities firms quickly shifted to selling, and retail investors also followed suit to close out positions, falling to a low price of 4,160 yuan. Later, Hong Kong gold prices rose, but this failed to attract followers, and speculators had no effect. Therefore, the noon close was only 4,161 yuan. In the afternoon, the off-exchange market stabilized, with prices at 4,165 yuan to 4,170 yuan.  Half-day trading totaled just over one thousand taels. Jewelry gold prices remained unchanged.  Customs gold prices also remained flat.

Raw Gold Down 19 Yuan

Since the morning opening, each bar (ten taels) carried over the previous day's momentum, and securities firms still had purchasing interest, pushing up the market by 10 yuan. Securities firms bought ten taels from gold shops, at a price of 4,190 yuan. Shortly after, a certain money exchange business took advantage of the high price to sell, and cash shops also followed suit to sell. Seeing this situation, buyers stopped, and the price fell by 20 yuan. Cash shops sold 30 taels to money exchange businesses for 4,170 yuan. Subsequently, because the exchange market softened slightly, sentiment improved, and a certain gold shop, on behalf of speculators, took the lead in buying, rebounding by 15 yuan. Gold shops bought 10 taels from securities firms for 4,185 yuan. Then, because the foreign exchange market suddenly softened slightly, securities firms frequently released their holdings, and at that time, there were few buyers.  The price fell again, dropping by 25 yuan. Gold shops sold 20 taels to money exchange businesses for 4,160 yuan. At that time, Hong Kong gold suddenly commissioned a certain gold shop to buy several hundred taels, immediately pulling the price up by 10 yuan. Money exchange businesses did 10 taels among themselves for 4,170 yuan. After that, buying interest subsided, and securities firms continued to sell, dropping back to a low price of 4,160 yuan. At noon, a certain money exchange business took advantage of the low price to buy again, and the price rebounded by 3 yuan. Money exchange businesses bought ten taels from securities firms for 4,163 yuan. Later, another money exchange business sold 50 taels to securities firms for 4,161 yuan as the noon closing price. As a result, the price fell by 19 yuan compared to the previous day.  The fluctuation in half a day was only 30 yuan. The selling price of the cash shop's own-brand gold was several yuan higher than the raw gold price, and the purchase price was reduced by slightly less than 20 yuan. The current standard gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was little trading.

Jewelry Gold Remained Unchanged All Day

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael did not change all day because the raw gold price did not fluctuate much. Large firms continued to list at 420 yuan, and new firms had the same prices. The purchase price was reduced by slightly less than 15 yuan.

### Foreign Currencies Slightly Softer

Yesterday, the supply of British and American gold pounds was slightly plentiful, and the market was softer. The supply and demand of gold notes were balanced, and British notes remained stable and unchanged. American notes were weaker.  The evening market was 13 yuan, 3 jiao, 2 fen. Hong Kong note transactions were mediocre and unchanged. French franc notes had a slight supply, and the market was slightly weak. Japanese gold notes had very strong demand. It was heard that the market price in Hankou was expensive, and there was profit to be made by carrying them.  The market was excited. The evening market was 1 yuan, 2 jiao, 9 fen, 4 li. Korean notes had little demand.  The evening market was 1 yuan, 1 jiao, 0 fen, 5 li.  Yesterday's market prices were such that British and American gold pounds both fell by 2 jiao.  American gold notes fell by 3 fen.  French franc notes fell by 2 li.  Other currencies remained unchanged.

### Securities - No Place for Speculation - Attention Focused on Government Bonds

Yesterday's unofficial securities market had a slightly active atmosphere. This was not due to changes in the environment, but rather because the market had been dull for too long, and after extreme stagnation, there was a desire for movement. Recently, types A and B bonds have shown a slight upward trend. The war situation has also improved. Furthermore, because there are no opportunities to capitalize within other speculative businesses, those who have been sitting on government bonds are also tempted to try and profit, which stimulates movement. However, this lacks lasting power and still depends on changes in the environmental situation. Yesterday, buyers were relatively more numerous than sellers.  Transactions also increased slightly. Although old bulls sold at high prices, there was no shortage of new bulls increasing their long positions.  Because the interest payment date was approaching, some short positions were also closed out. On the buying side, Credit Foncier and Dingkang were the most active. In the afternoon, Xie Da and Datong also bought in considerably. Although Yongkang, Jiufeng, and Dakangcheng sold at any time, the market price was still relatively strong.  Therefore, the result was a uniform rebound of between 0.15 yuan and 0.25 yuan.  The total number of transactions was approximately 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below.

Stock Transactions - 50 shares of Greater China Match Company were traded at a price of 18.5 yuan per share.

The clearing of accounts at the Stock Exchange, scheduled for the 21st of this month, was closed at noon yesterday. Although there was still a small amount of long positions being released, they were absorbed very quickly. The fluctuation throughout the morning was small, and the transaction volume was also relatively small. A few minutes before the close, buyers became active again, and sellers held back. Jardine Matheson shares - the company recently announced an interim dividend for this session (up to March 1940) of 3 yuan, to be paid on January 17 next year. Yesterday, the price did not rise but fell, which was contrary to general expectations. This was probably because the closing of long positions was not yet complete. The closing price was 73.5 yuan for purchase. Rubber stock prices were stable.  The scope of interest from all parties has recently expanded to include various stocks. Stocks such as P.L.M. and Anglo-Java have shown a slight upward trend. Shares such as Langkat, Tanah Merah, Rubber Trust, and Galah Datan have strong public demand.

London, 15th - Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt remained generally stable. However, the Reorganization Loan, British section, fell by another 1/8 pound, to a price of 33 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.

Hong Kong-registered shares fell by 0.5 pounds, to 84.5 pounds. Cullac Rubber shares rebounded by 9 pence, to a price of 22 shillings, 6 pence. The rest had minor movements.

### Yarn and Cloth - Coarse Yarn Still Expensive - Affecting the Finer Yarn

The previously calm yarn market continued to show signs of fatigue yesterday. However, most yarn prices continued to rise.  General opinion was that the cotton market could not weaken, and there was a long and bullish view of foreign cotton. As a result, everyone dragged in and hoped for higher prices. However, actual sales were sluggish, and domestic consumption was not smooth. Therefore, although some strong parties bought in the yarn market, the trend was still hovering. Once customer sales come, the future may rise.

The spot yarn market opened with a peaceful atmosphere. 20-count Double Horse yarn opened at 743 yuan. However, there were more sellers than buyers at this price. Shortly after, it fell by three or four yuan to 738 yuan. However, a certain part of the multiple parties, seeing that the base of 20-count yarn was sufficient and the pressure was still heavy, had already changed course to buy 10-count coarse yarn. As 10-count yarn rose, fine yarn was also affected, and it returned to 741 yuan. After a long period of hovering, there were no major changes. The half-day trading statistics showed that 995 bales were traded. 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 3 yuan. Heavenly Lady yarn fell by 4 yuan. Xie Earth yarn fell by 2-3 yuan. Today, 59 pieces of yarn were transported to Tianjin. The amount bought by each gang port is listed on the left:

Guild: 820 Bales Hong Kong: 140 Bales

Domestic: 20 Bales Amoy: 10 Bales

Total: 995

### Factory Appetite Unchanged - Cotton Stops Rising

The cotton market, which had been rising for several days, also stopped rising and entered a period of calm stagnation. As far as foreign cotton is concerned, the market cannot be underestimated. However, factories are using up their cheap stored cotton, and there is no intention to purchase more. Therefore, the recent buying has been mostly done by fellow traders. As for cotton merchants who have already profited and sold, the appetite of new entrants is sluggish. Cotton from northern Jiangsu included 1,520 bales of Tongzhou cotton, 970 bales of Changyinsha cotton, and 856 bales of Beisha cotton. The current cotton situation is recorded below:

Secondary Cotton 159.25 Fellow Traders Bought 176 Bales

Tongzhou 170.00 Also 200 Bales

In other news, the market price of foreign cotton was that the New York cotton market opened soft yesterday morning, due to telegrams reporting declines from Liverpool and Mumbai. Speculators sold, and cotton prices fell by more than 10 pounds. Later, due to the strength of the banking sector and short covering, the market turned active, and the closing price actually rose by more than 10 to 20 pounds compared to the previous day. India fell by 7 rupees. Egypt fell sharply by 200 pounds. Liverpool fell by 25 pence.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions - Yesterday was dull. Traders were using spot transactions, and the procedures were cumbersome. It would be easier to change to trading futures on the US cotton exchange, which would be more convenient and allow for larger profits. Therefore, they are becoming increasingly indifferent to spot cotton. Factories have been very quiet lately. Japanese manufacturers have changed their subsidies for US cotton to 20 pounds, and there has been no trading. The price of yesterday's cotton converted at a US exchange rate of 7.5 yuan for delivery to the factory is recorded below:

20-count US Middling: 243.25

Also, Subgrade: 238.80

32-count: 250.40

42-count: 253.95

Also, Subgrade: 245.95

Native nails have suddenly become active recently, with both囤戶 (those who hoard goods to sell later) and construction gangs buying, and trading among fellow traders has been particularly active. Initially, the price was shouted at 46 yuan, but by the end, it had been raised to nearly 50 yuan.

Black steel billets, due to both incoming and outgoing sales being strong, have created an unusually lively market. Prices have risen again compared to before. The current market price is 17-18 yuan per box, with more than 200 boxes sold throughout the city.

### Sugar Market - Diaoqing Increases by 2 Yuan

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was firm. The guild's current spot prices for 24 coarse white sugar saw little fluctuation. The price at this firm was 58.3 yuan, the price of new goods at foreign firms was 59 yuan, the price of old goods was 58.5 yuan, and the price of re-exported goods was 49 yuan.

### Coal - Kailuan No. 1 Dust Coal - No Supply - No. 2 Very Popular

All grades of Kailuan dust coal have seen strong demand recently due to the severe weather. However, the source of supply from the mines has been affected due to a shortage of barges. The current price of Kailuan No. 1 dust coal is 82 yuan per ton, but there is no supply. Only No. 2 dust coal is available, with over 2,000 tons sold daily and delivered to customers at 74 yuan per ton.

### Piece Goods - Women's Overcoat Business Booming - Custom Orders Keep Them Busy

Due to the difficulty of ordering, and the limited amount arriving for traders, traders mostly search for existing stock, leading to existing stock and Shanghai factory goods all selling more than in previous years. Women's clothing retailers have seen an extremely booming business in custom overcoats, with women's stores around Four Horse Road seeing so much business that they can't keep up. Most of what they need are long-haired velvet Hai Bailong, with ordinary ready-made orders for Three Camel Brand selling for 100 yuan each, while non-Three Camel Brand sells for 90 yuan, mohair sells for 120 yuan, short-haired Hai Bailong sells for 85 yuan, and corduroy, selling for 20 yuan or more, has no buyers.

### Yellow Camel Wool in Short Supply

Double-sided yellow camel wool, which was very popular a few years ago, is now in short supply on both the arrival and sales sides. Eastern goods, which used to flood the market, have now disappeared. Western goods have generally increased by 60-70% compared to before. The market price of this type of double-sided yellow camel wool is currently 22-23 yuan per yard for No. 1 and 16-17 yuan for No. 2.

### "Jiangsu Finance Department" Copper Coin Notes

Paper money panic has spread throughout the city, and the occupied areas have also been affected. The puppet organization "Jiangsu Finance Department" took this opportunity to issue so-called copper coin notes (with denominations of one coin, ten coins, fifteen coins, and thirty coins) of four types. The thickness of the paper varied depending on the face value. The pictures printed on the front of the notes were all Suzhou landscapes, and the back had the words "Issued by the Jiangsu Finance Department Provincial Treasury" and "Applicable Throughout the Province." It is now being used in Suzhou, where the "provincial government" is located, and other affiliated areas are also making efforts to promote it. The sample styles and versions are on the left.

The front and back of the one-coin note are all pink, with the character "1" printed on both sides of the center on the back. The front and back of the ten-coin note are all dark green, with the number "10" printed on both sides of the center on the back. The front and back of the fifteen-coin note are all brown, with "15" printed in the four corners and the number "15" printed twice in the center of the back. The front and back of the thirty-coin note are all dark blue, with "30" printed in the four corners and the number "30" printed in the center of the back. (Pure)

### A Page of Historical Material on the Yunnan Uprising - Cai Songpo Rising Up to Punish Yuan

— Gong Huai

The Yunnan Uprising was a continuation of the 1911 Revolution, a struggle against autocratic regimes. It wrote a glorious page in the history of the nation. Although the targets of these two revolutions were different, as the 1911 Revolution aimed to overthrow the corrupt Qing government and the Yunnan Uprising aimed to overthrow the traitorous Yuan Shikai government, their value and significance were equally great. When we commemorate this heroic revolutionary action, we cannot fail to pay our highest respects to the wise and courageous General Cai Songpo!

Yuan Shikai's Imperial Dream

Since Yuan Shikai seized the presidential throne with the strength of the Beiyang warlords and bureaucrats, he stepped up the implementation of policies to eliminate revolutionaries, hoping to change the state system and satisfy his imperial craving with the support of his henchmen. By 1915, Yuan's imperial conspiracy was fully exposed. Externally, he borrowed huge amounts of foreign debt without the approval of the Senate, which he used to raise troops and purchase weapons, preparing to deal with revolutionaries who opposed the monarchy. He did not hesitate to cede sovereign rights and humiliate the country, recognizing the independence of Tibet in exchange for the understanding of the United Kingdom, and signing the Twenty-One Demands as compensation for Japan's permission for him to become emperor. Internally, in addition to intensifying the massacre and imprisonment of revolutionaries, he instructed his henchmen to organize the so-called "筹安会 (Preparatory Society for Peace)," advocating a monarchy. At the same time, he secretly telegraphed his henchmen distributed in various provinces, ordering them to jointly telegraph to urge him to advance. After a hypocritical show of humility, on December 12, he openly ordered himself to be emperor, changing the era name to "洪憲 (Hongxian)." Thus, this monkey crowned himself and clumsily took the stage.

General Cai Enticed into Beijing

General Cai Songpo was originally a soldier with revolutionary ideas. After graduating from the Japanese Military Academy, he joined the army and participated in revolutionary work. After the founding of the Republic of China, he was promoted to governor of Yunnan for his military achievements. Yuan, with his deliberate plans to become emperor, naturally regarded such an iron-willed man with suspicion. Therefore, before his conspiracy was exposed, he ordered the removal of General Cai's military power. Still not feeling at ease, he transferred General Cai to Beijing, to serve as a director of the Sutra Compilation Bureau, a position with no real power. After entering Beijing, General Cai saw through Yuan's intentions. Because secret agents were always by his side, he was under Yuan's strict surveillance and was already like a tiger in a cage.

Clever Escape Through a Fake Banquet

Although General Cai was in a dangerous situation, he did not show any emotion on his face, mingling with the Yuan faction day and night, indulging in lavish entertainment, pretending to be in "this happy place, not thinking of Shu," causing Yuan's suspicion of him to gradually fade. To avoid implicating his wife, he secretly discussed a plan. General Cai deliberately indulged in pleasure outside, and Mrs. Cai deliberately quarreled and even fought with him. As a result, Mrs. Cai went to the judicial衙門 (Yamen) to complain, saying how outrageous and careless General Cai was about his family, requesting a divorce. General Cai also pointed out in court how shrewish his wife was and was willing to divorce. Seeing that both parties were willing, the judicial official granted the divorce. Mrs. Cai jumped out of the tiger's den and packed her bags to return to her hometown in Hunan. General Cai was secretly delighted that the initial plan had succeeded. One day, he held a large banquet somewhere, inviting many military men and bureaucrats. When the wine was half drunk, General Cai claimed to have something to do and excused himself, saying he would return in a while. Those of the Yuan faction and the secret agents sent by Yuan did not suspect anything because General Cai was the host today. General Cai then called a rickshaw to the station. Near the station, he bribed the rickshaw puller and exchanged clothes with him in a secluded place, mingling in the noisy crowd. He took a train to Tianjin. Then, he quietly boarded a Japanese ship to Japan, transited through Annam, and returned to Yunnan. On that day, by the time the Yuan faction realized it, General Cai had already boarded a Japanese ship and safely escaped.

The National Protection Army and the Demise of Hongxian

At this time, Tang Jiyao in Yunnan, although he had military power, hesitated to raise troops to punish Yuan, fearing that he was isolated and weak. Just as he was undecided, General Cai happened to escape back to Yunnan, so he strongly urged Tang Jiyao to raise troops to protect the country and oppose the monarchy. He himself served as the commander-in-chief of the First National Protection Army, and together with Li Liejun, commander-in-chief of the Second Army, fiercely attacked Sichuan and Guangdong, with irresistible force. At the same time, Liu Xianshi, governor of Guizhou, and Lu Rongting, governor of Guangxi, also rose up in response. Almost half of the southwest was filled with an atmosphere of punishing Yuan. When the news reached Beijing, Yuan realized that the situation was not good, and even his "confidants" had defected. Under feelings of worry and anger, on March 24, he had to order the abolition of the monarchy. The life of "Hongxian" was only 83 days, and the generation of traitor Yuan Shikai had a short imperial dream and soon departed from this world.

### Christmas and Disaster Relief Movement —Hoping All of Shanghai Will Actively Promote It—

— Xing

This year's Christmas is the third celebration since the war. Although various sectors continue to hold celebrations every year, they are still much less joyous than before the war. However, if we calculate the consumption spent on celebrating Christmas, the amount must still be astonishing!

On Christmas Eve, the dance halls, bars, and cinemas all over Shanghai are filled with a different kind of festive scene; they have all turned into earthly paradises, indulging in extravagant pleasures, filled with joy and excitement, celebrating wildly. The consumption for one night can range from dozens to hundreds of yuan per person. At the same time, let us look back at the refugees this year, exposed on the streets, without clothes or food, in a terribly miserable situation. The other day, the weather suddenly turned bitterly cold, and in one day, more than fifty refugees and coolies in the two concessions were frozen to death. Others who barely survive are countless. What's more, in the current situation of extremely high living costs, the lives of the poor are even more severely oppressed. These many poor refugees are eagerly waiting for you, great philanthropists, to donate and provide relief, so I propose a Christmas disaster relief movement. Generously donate money to be used for refugee relief, which will definitely save many refugees. Then, celebrating Christmas will be more meaningful.

Furthermore, I hope that all dance halls, bars, and cinemas in Shanghai will hold fundraisings for winter clothing donations on that day. If some prizes can be added to reward the generous philanthropists and increase the interest of donors, the income from donations will definitely be exceptionally enthusiastic!

Finally, I also hope that people from all walks of life can naturally participate in this Christmas disaster relief movement, appealing for the refugees and creating blessings for them.

### Various Aspects of Christmas

— Xinliang

Turkey

As soon as Christmas arrives, all the food stores on Avenue Joffre have already hung up beautiful and eye-catching turkeys. Europeans and Americans regard turkey as the only delicacy on Christmas Day, so there are countless people in Shanghai who have seen their preferences and are doing seasonal business. Speaking of turkeys, those produced in the United States are the best, fat and delicious, costing more than ten U.S. dollars each; Zhoushan, China, is also known for producing turkeys, but compared with American turkeys, Zhoushan turkeys are ultimately inferior, because they are inferior in terms of breeding and breeding methods compared to the American methods. Therefore, if we want to recover the outflow of rights and interests, we must go through extensive research and improvement.

Christmas Cake

According to Western customs, every time Christmas arrives, in addition to preparing turkey as food, the most popular thing is this kind of Christmas cake. Every housewife must make a large, white-capped cake on Christmas Eve for the whole family to celebrate Christmas. According to general people, eating this white-capped cake is not only delicious but can also bring unexpected good luck in the coming year.

Santa Claus

A face full of snow-white beard, wearing a red suit, carrying a full bag on his back, descending to the world in a reindeer sleigh—this person is our old friend we call "Santa Claus." Almost every child in Europe and America likes the arrival of this old friend, because from him, children can get countless toys. Although children know that this "Santa Claus" is just a character in people's imagination, because of the customary tradition, there are still "foolish children" who take off their socks to wait for him to send gifts. In the world full of gunpowder smoke, would "Santa Claus" be unhappy to come to the world again, dear children, have you ever thought about it?

Christmas Card

It is said that Christmas cards originated in England, but we don't need to worry about the date of its birth here. At present, every major city in the world has this kind of "Christmas card" popular, and it can be said that everyone likes it. The so-called "Christmas card" is originally a few thin sheets of paper with a few congratulatory words written on it, or a beautiful picture drawn on it, to be sent to relatives and friends to congratulate them on good luck in the coming year. At first, this habit of sending greeting cards only existed between Christians, until in the most recent century, this custom has spread to people of all classes around the world.

Christmas Tree

The Christmas tree is also a kind of decoration in Christmas. Children like to put all kinds of small candles or toys on the tree, and then hold hands around it, singing and dancing, to celebrate Christmas. These Christmas trees, some large and some small, are covered with red, green, gold, and silver streamers, and some are specially equipped with small electric lights, with various colors complementing each other, which is really extremely beautiful.

All in all, everything about Christmas symbolizes a peaceful, beautiful, and joyful scene; let us wait for the coming of bright and brilliant days.

### Mourning Couplet for Cai E by Liang Rengong

— Wenyi

General Cai Songpo studied at the Hunan Ziqiang Academy in his early years, and Mr. Liang Rengong deeply valued his talent. Although Liang and Cai had different political views, their friendship as teacher and friend was very strong. After Yuan's defeat and death, General Cai also died of overwork. Rengong wrote a eulogy to express his grief and also wrote a mourning couplet saying:

"I saw the son go forth but did not see his return; Heaven has not yet abandoned this culture, yet how could it bear to abandon this worthy man?

Comparing the early death of the General to the death of Yan Hui, expressing the utmost grief and pity.

### Unofficial History of the War of Resistance, Part 1: Christmas in Wuhan, 1937. 33. Madame Chiang Kai-shek Asks Chairman Chiang to Eat Turkey. The Price of a Turkey is Twenty-Five Yuan.

Another Christmas season is here. Let me tell you a Christmas story during the War of Resistance.

According to Western customs, a turkey must be served in the dishes to celebrate every Christmas holiday. In the winter of 1937, when Chairman Chiang commanded the army and was stationed in Wuhan, he was really very hard. On the eve of Christmas, Madam Soong Mei-ling felt that even though she was busy with military affairs, Chairman Chiang was working so hard for the country and should be happy on this festive season. She immediately called Huang Renlin, the director of the New Life Movement General Association, and told him her intention, and ordered him to buy a turkey immediately. Huang Renlin obeyed the order and ordered the secretary Wei Chunzeng to do it. Wei Chunzeng immediately took a car to various chicken shops to buy turkeys. Unexpectedly, in such a big Wuhan, he could not buy a turkey. Wei Chunzeng was quick-witted. He thought that if he could not buy it in the city, why not look for it in the countryside? He immediately drove the car out of the city. It was really a coincidence. Soon after the car left the city, he found a turkey next to a farmer's thatched house. Wei Chunzeng was overjoyed when he saw it, and immediately jumped out of the car, ran into the thatched house, and asked the farmer to buy the turkey. It happened that things are often not as expected. The farmer said that the turkey was for breeding, and he would not sell it no matter how much it cost. This made Wei Chunzeng at a loss. He thought about it and had to tell the reason, telling him that the chicken was bought for Chairman Chiang to eat. This moved the farmer's heart, and he finally sold it for twenty-five yuan. When Chairman Chiang and his wife had dinner together on the first day to celebrate the festival, there was a turkey dish on the menu.

### Talking About the Winter Solstice Festival

— Li Binglu

Explanation of the Winter Solstice

The Winter Solstice is also known as the Longest Day. The Book of Rites says, "In the middle of winter, the days are shortest," so it is also called the Shortest Day. The Dream Record says, "The capital attaches the greatest importance to the Winter Solstice Festival, changing clothes and offering sacrifices to ancestors, just like the New Year." According to the Book of Song, Ritual Records, "During the Wei and Jin dynasties, the Winter Solstice was the day when all countries and officials congratulated the emperor, so a small meeting was held, which was second only to the New Year's Day," so the Winter Solstice is also called the Sub-Year. But what is the Winter Solstice? According to the Interpretation of Calendrical Meaning, "The sun travels in the sky to the southeast corner of Xun Wei and reaches its extreme here, so it is called the Winter Solstice." As for the "arrival" (至) in the Winter Solstice, it also has a origin. Let's look at what the Classic of Filial Piety says: "The Big Dipper points to Zi for the Winter Solstice, and arrival has three meanings: first, the arrival of the extreme of Yin; second, the arrival of the beginning of Yang energy; and third, the sun travels to the south, so it is called arrival."

Anecdotes of the Winter Solstice

There are also many anecdotes about the Winter Solstice Festival. During the Jin and Wei dynasties, the palace used red threads to measure the shadow of the sun, and after the Winter Solstice, the length of the day increased by one thread. In the Tang dynasty, the palace used women to measure the length of the day, and after the Winter Solstice, the day increased by the work of one thread compared to normal days. Therefore, Du Fu's Winter Solstice poem says: "Every day, worry follows the lengthening thread." In ancient times, every time the Winter Solstice came, the market was closed for three days, and people hung curtains and gambled, which was called "Celebrating the Festival." According to the Book of Changes, Tonggua Yan, "During the Winter Solstice, the ruler brings in the eight talents, or tunes the Yellow Bell, or tunes the Six Laws, or tunes the Five Elements, or tunes the Law Calendar." Linghu Chu's Table states that building Zi is the origin of the Three Subtle Things, and the Yellow Bell is the foundation of the Six Laws. When the winter air arrives, the Wall Star is in the middle." According to the Ming Dynasty's Comprehensive Canon, every Winter Solstice Festival, the emperor bestows mink fur hats on the officials, and the emperor wears new mink fur. During the Winter Solstice Festival in the Han Dynasty, people wore crimson robes. The Ritual Records of the Later Han Dynasty says, "During the Winter Solstice, all officials in the capital wear crimson." During the Kaiyuan period of the Tang Dynasty, there was heavy snow, and the eaves dripped into icicles. A concubine asked a servant to knock off two branches to look at and play with. The emperor asked what they were, and the concubine laughed and said, "These are ice tendons." During the Jin Dynasty, there was a man named Zhou Yi, whose courtesy name was Boren, whose mother was Li, whose courtesy name was Luoxiu, who gave birth to Yi and Songmo, who were all in prominent positions. During the Winter Solstice, she raised a cup and gave it to her three sons, saying: "You are all noble, what else do I have to worry about?" Song said, "I'm afraid it's not as good as your will. Yi has great ambitions but short talents, which is not the way to preserve oneself. Song is straightforward and not tolerated in the world. Only Anu is mediocre and always in my mother's sight."

Nine-Nine Elimination of Cold

Binzhou's Five-Cover Mountain determines the price of rice based on the amount of snowfall during the Winter Solstice each year. Therefore, the Unified Records says, "When the Five Covers are covered with snow, rice is as cheap as dirt." Cao Zhi's Memorial says, "I have seen in the old rituals that the country offers shoes and socks during the Winter Solstice to welcome fortune and step on longevity." In recent ancient times, women often offered shoes and socks to their mothers-in-law on the Winter Solstice to step on the meaning of longevity. In ancient times, during the Winter Solstice, people painted a branch of plain plum blossoms with eighty-one petals, dyed one petal each day, and when all the petals were dyed, the Nine-Nine was over, and spring was deep, which was called "Nine-Nine Elimination of Cold Picture."

The Day Before the Winter Solstice

Du Shi's note says, "The day before the Winter Solstice is the Lesser Solstice." But according to the Tang Dynasty's General Records, "The Lesser Solstice is the second day." The Old Study House's Notes says, "(The day before the Winter Solstice is called the Winter Stay, which is opposite to the New Year's Eve, which is the Min dialect)." Lu Zhi's Biography says, "That night is the Winter Solstice New Year's Eve." From this, we can know that the Tang people also called the day before the Winter Solstice the New Year's Eve, so there is the sentence "The sun and the moon are removed" in the Poetry of Tang Style.

Winter Solstice Customs

According to legend, Gonggong had an incompetent son who died during the Winter Solstice and became a plague ghost who was afraid of red beans, so during the Winter Solstice, people cooked red bean porridge to ward off evil. Jiao's Classification of Forests says, "During the Winter Solstice, at midnight, comb your hair one thousand two hundred times to praise the Yang energy, and at the end of the year, the five organs will circulate, which is called the immortal hair washing method." In Luoyang, people fry Green Pearl every Winter Solstice and wear a Yang scarf on their heads. In Wu's customs, people attach great importance to the Winter Solstice Festival, saying that it is a fat festival and a thin year, and they give each other festival gifts. Liu Shilang Du Yin has a poem that says, "Every family talks about etiquette during the festival, and it takes a lot of effort to welcome and send."

### Random Talks on the Winter Solstice in Various Places

— Fuyun

Although the people in various parts of our country have different customs for the annual Winter Solstice Festival, they all attach importance to this day. Now, I will write down the Winter Solstice activities that I have personally experienced and publish them in this journal. I think the readers will also want to hear about them.

People in Ningbo attach more importance to the Winter Solstice Festival than to Qingming; those who work away from home mostly return to their hometown to worship their ancestors before the Winter Solstice, which has been passed down for many years and is highly valued. Although it is the same as the Qingming Festival, they worship their ancestors at home (Ningbo calls it making soup rice, and the character "soup" is pronounced like the syllable "gang"). The ancestral halls in the countryside perform operas. Because Qingming is exactly when the farm work begins, the Winter Solstice is when the year's crops have been harvested, and there are more people available. If the year is a good harvest, they are particularly extravagant in their performances for the ancestral halls, and they do not hesitate to spend more money. In addition to worshiping their ancestors, there is also a "security" act of respecting gods, which is said to be a wish for peace and security in the home during the year (Ningbo calls it the twenty-ninth night), which is different from other places.

The act is performed within three days before and after the Winter Solstice Festival, or on the Winter Solstice itself. They use yellow paper and ink brush (a piece of yellow paper one foot long and four inches wide) to write the two big characters "保安" (Security) on it, and then write two lines below, one line for the month of this month (that is, the day of respecting the gods) and the line below for the surname of the family who is doing the offering. The time for respecting the gods is uncertain in the morning and afternoon, but most of them are in the afternoon. They use a pair of yellow candles, or green candles, but most of them use green candles, and insert green incense in the middle. They offer chicken, fish, and meat as three animals, fruits, three cups of clean tea, and the number of wine glasses is determined by the number of months in the year. For twelve months, they use eleven glasses, and for the intercalary month, they use thirteen glasses. A basin of burning charcoal is placed in front of the table, and another basin of clear water is placed next to the basin to take the meaning of peace between water and fire. They also make a kind of rice flour cake, which is four inches in diameter, mixed with sugar in the flour, solid without filling, with sesame seeds on it, called Winter Solstice Cake.

People in Shanghai's rural areas also attach great importance to the Winter Solstice. For example, if a family has a new bereavement that has lasted for three years, there is an act of "taking away the spirit tablet," which means "removing the mourning" or "taking off the mourning" (in various parts of northern Jiangsu, after three years of mourning, it is called taking off the mourning). They are usually held on Qingming or Winter Solstice. That is, on the morning of the Winter Solstice, they first invite the spirit tablet on the spirit platform to the ancestral hall, and then put all the elegiac couplets, as well as all the hanging plain objects, and the table for offering the main item, into the river together, taking the meaning of throwing away the bad luck. When removing the spirit table, the movements are very agile, called "taking away the spirit platform," and the Taoist priest recites it once before removing it. Shanghai's customs also regard the Winter Solstice as a ghost festival, and there is also a local folk song: Winter Solstice night (pronounced as "ye" sound), put out at every house, if you have it, eat all night, if you don't have it, cry all night. Although it is a superstition, it is also to persuade future generations not to forget their roots and to be careful in pursuing their ancestors.

### Casual Talk about Christmas

— Shi Wenda

If you are often out and about, then you will definitely see that the major companies, dance halls, churches, and other places are decorated exceptionally brilliantly and pleasing to the eye. This is the Christmas of Europeans and Americans. Because this day is often two days after our country's Winter Solstice Festival, some people give it an elegant name and call it "Foreign Winter Solstice."

Historically speaking, Jesus was not born in the year 1 AD, but in 4 BC, which was about the time of Emperor Ai of the Former Han Dynasty in our country. He was born in Bethlehem Village in the country of Judea. Let us examine whether his birthday is on December 25th.

According to the biography of the new four gospels, "When Jesus was born, shepherds came to worship. However, although Palestine is located in the eastern Mediterranean, its climate is continental, so the winters are very cold. Shepherds could not possibly be in the fields doing pastoral work. From this, we can know that December 25th is not a correct day. Then the reader will ask, why did later generations choose this day as Jesus' birthday?

We must know that in ancient Greece, the Greeks regarded the birthday of the Egyptian sun god RE as a carnival. Later, the Romans also inherited this festival. Therefore, in the early fourth century, a Pope in Rome changed the birthday of the sun god to celebrate the birth of Jesus.

In the middle of the fourth century, Bishop St. Nicholas of Myra used money to help poor children on Christmas Day. Later, it was adopted by various places and became the origin of today's Santa Claus giving gifts to children.

### Winter Solstice: The Rebirth of Yang – The Astronomical Winter Solstice

— Guan

The Winter Solstice of each year invariably falls on the 21st, 22nd, or 23rd of December in the Gregorian calendar. However, there's no fixed date in the Lunar calendar, so you have to consult an almanac. The Summer Solstice, Spring Equinox, and Autumn Equinox are similar. For example, the Spring Equinox is in the third month after the Winter Solstice, which is the 20th of March in the Gregorian calendar next year. Originally, these four solar terms divide the year into equal parts, each getting a quarter. The attached diagram shows the situation of the Northern Hemisphere on the Winter Solstice, with short days and long nights, and the arrow indicates the sunlight coming in.

As the sun revolves in its orbit, on the day of the Winter Solstice, its light shines directly on 23.5 degrees south of the equator, which is Australia, the South African Federation, Paraguay, etc. After that, it gradually moves towards the northern part of the Earth, crossing the equator and reaching 23.5 degrees north of the equator, which is the Summer Solstice. This year's sunlight, its time. Because the sunlight moves, the person has a Yang Sheng thought is: draw a gradually longer. According to the truth, the two times the direct sunlight crosses the equator, that is, the Spring and Autumn passed the Winter Solstice the Earth's northern part in our country's ancient "Winter Solstice a language, meaning over the Winter Solstice and night gradually shorter air should also gradually hot, but the Earth's heat has been over a long period of emission, must be repeated storage, coupled with the northern cold wind invasion, the weather is still extremely cold. Because what determines the cold and heat of the weather is not just sunlight.

The locals in Shanghai have a folk saying of "Starting the Nine" (起九), indicating the process of the weather gradually becoming warm and harmonious. Counting from the Winter Solstice, nine days later is the first nine, eighteen days later is the second nine, until ninety-nine eighty-one days. It is recorded below, and I think that there are many foreigners in Shanghai, and they also want to read it, but according to the author's six or seven years of experience, the increase in heat is a little later than in the proverb.

"From the first nine to the second nine, greet (i.e. salute) without taking out your hands. On the third nine, the twenty-seventh day, the fence is blown to pieces. On the fourth nine, the thirty-sixth day, sleeping at night is like sleeping in the open air. On the fifth nine, the forty-fifth day, the sun opens the door. On the sixth nine, the fifty-fourth day, the tree tops are green and vibrant. On the seventh nine, the sixty-third day, the cloth quilt is spread out at both ends. On the eighth nine, the seventy-second day, cotton clothes are exchanged for lined clothes. On the ninth nine, the eighty-first day, clothes can be taken off casually."

### Prelude to Christmas

— Tianzhu

Christmas is coming soon, and the children are happily waiting for its arrival; this holiday is traditionally the sweetest day for children. Santa Claus, with his white hair, amiably sends a large number of gifts, everyone eats candy, plays with toys, and enthusiastically holds a grand celebration. On this day, children are filled with excitement and joy.

But children! For more than two years, the flames of the War of Resistance have spread throughout every corner of the motherland. Our Christmas has also been spent in the deep waters and scorching heat of the motherland. Although many children in the isolated island are sheltered at home, they still eat well and dress well, and everything is very comfortable. They are truly the darlings of paradise. However, let us look at the little beggars wandering in the streets and the refugee children in the shelters. What kind of life are they living! Is it because they are gluttonous and lazy? No, no, it is all caused by the ruthless artillery fire of the invaders.

The northwest wind is blowing very hard, and the weather has turned into severe winter. Children on the isolated island are living two different lives, one is comfortable and enjoyable, and the other is hungry and cold.

Children! Christmas brings joy, but today, when we are planning to celebrate Christmas, do not forget the suffering group. We should have the spirit of "sharing weal and woe," mobilize the children in the city, and launch the "Christmas Saving Disaster Relief" campaign, eat less candy, buy fewer toys, and use the money saved to help the children in distress. The amount may not be considerable, but by accumulating little by little, and by gathering sand into a tower, there will be good results! All the strength is accumulated from bit by bit.

Children! Let's respond to the "Christmas Saving Disaster Relief" campaign!

### A Story of a Czech National Hero

— Xufeng

Since the Czech Republic was annexed by Germany in March this year, the entire Czech Republic has been under the control of the German National Socialist Party's terror. At the same time, heroic resistance has also been constantly manifested.

Now, the entire Czech nation is devoutly saying the name of Al Palmer. He is a national hero. But he is not a great person, he is just a locomotive driver.

One day, he drove a train from Brno to Rhineland. The locomotive was towing fifty freight cars, each guarded by a German officer from the Special Service Department, because it contained eight hundred machine guns and eight hundred world-famous Biron cannons (which are the best in the world) from Brno to Germany.

The train advanced north along the Moravian fountain. Al Palmer cheerfully sucked on his short pipe, smiling slightly at the German soldier who was watching him from the side, while pointing out the famous scenery to him.

At this time, he gave a signal to the fireman next to him, and the fireman raised his shovel and hit the German soldier's head. The German soldier's head was cracked open and he fell down heavily.

Al Palmer pulled the brakes and shouted to the fireman: "Jump out!" The fireman quickly jumped out of the car, fell down and got up, and hid in the deep forest. Then Al Palmer pulled off the governor and drove forward at full speed. When he reached a turning point, there was a sudden deafening explosion, and the things loaded on the train turned into countless fragments, flying in the sky. It turned out that a large amount of explosives had been buried in advance by Al Palmer and his comrades.

In this way, eight hundred machine guns and eight hundred Biron cannons were seized from the hands of the cruel enemy. Al Palmer was placed in a coffin by his comrades. His face wore a smile, like a victorious hero.

### Sacrifices—Ming-er's Record of Fleeing from Disaster, No. 47—

— Bai Zheng

In that village, one can find ancestral halls of all sizes everywhere—dilapidated, brand new; desolate, tidy; narrow, magnificent. From the various styles of these ancestral halls, one can draw a conclusion: if the descendants of a surname are wealthy, then their ancestral hall must be brand new, tidy, and magnificent. Otherwise, it must be dilapidated. However, although the ancestral halls are of various styles, they all have the same great admiration for their own surname's ancestors. Therefore, the sacrifices held in the spring and autumn seasons every year are considered a very important ritual by the villagers.

This was a day of bright spring sunshine, and also the day for holding the spring sacrifice. The women of the village all wore bright red paper flowers in their hair buns (this is a special custom in the village; on the first and fifteenth of each month, and on festive occasions and sacrifices, women except widows must wear flowers). That morning, they were already very busy, slaughtering livestock, cooking sacrificial dishes, washing sacrificial vessels... because each family prepared sacrificial dishes to sacrifice to their own family's ancestors.

The ancestral hall, which had been closed for a long time, opened its doors. Many people were sweeping, wiping, moving tables and chairs, hanging paintings and scrolls. By noon, most of the ancestral hall was ready. The long tables quietly awaited the sacrificial dishes brought by each family. A high and large stone table, a pair of stone candlesticks, and two rarely seen large candles stood tall on the candlesticks. At this time, the villagers participating in the sacrifice came one after another, carrying dishes, carrying baskets... a scene of chaos. Ming-er, who liked to meddle in everything, of course, somehow got busy and walked towards the ancestral hall. This is not surprising, because he had never seen it before, how could he give up this great opportunity? He stepped into the door of the ancestral hall without hesitation. At that time, someone carried two large and white pigs and followed him in, placing them on specially made wooden frames, decorated quite luxuriously. More and more people gathered to watch the ceremony, shattering the cold and quiet atmosphere of the ancestral hall, and the noisy sounds filled the entire hall. The men in the village all wore long robes, mandarin jackets, and top hats, coming one after another to participate in this grand ceremony. However, women did not have the qualification to participate, and could only watch the ceremony from the sidelines. This is an excellent example of the Chinese emphasis on men over women. When an elderly person walked in, the hall became a little quieter. After a burst of trumpet sounds, the sacrificial ceremony officially began. The elderly person (Ming-er later learned that he was the clan elder) recited some words that Ming-er did not understand. Then, eight children (of course, male) took plates and stood in two rows, walked to the sacrificial table in the center of the hall, placed the things on the plates into the empty plates on the table, and then retreated. Then, both the young and the old offered things in the same way. This took about a quarter of an hour. With the master of ceremonies shouting "Kowtow," all the men in the hall knelt down, performing the three kneelings and nine kowtows with great reverence. The women watching the ceremony did not even have the qualification to kowtow, indicating that they were not descendants of this clan. Ming-er felt very unfair in his heart, aren't women human? And those women really underestimated themselves, engraving in their minds this unreasonable custom from ancient times, "Women are lowly," which was very deep and not easy to break. Some of those women were laughing as they watched, not knowing the lowliness of their own status, but Ming-er felt very sorry for them.

The sacrifice ended with Ming-er's resentment, and the sound of trumpets playing in the hall and the sound of firecrackers exploding outside the door seemed to be celebrating the victory of male power!

### New Year's Card

— Zhang Xin

Everyone knows that the New Year is coming soon. When I think of the various joys of the New Year in the past, I can't help but smile.

I received a New Year's card in the morning, which reminded me. So I went to a nearby bookstore to choose and buy some. Although there were some for three or four cents each, they were not very elegant, and the usable ones would eventually cost several dimes. Being frugal, how could I be willing to buy them? I had to retreat. But this is a necessary social item.

The second New Year's card came. After I looked at it carefully, the problem of New Year's cards was immediately solved. It turned out that he made it himself with stationery. Moreover, everyone can make a New Year's card. The method is as follows:

Cut a piece of Western-style stationery horizontally into two pieces, then fold it in half. Then, draw a picture on one side with colored paints and gold and silver powders (mostly snow scenes as the subject matter. Gold and silver powders can be purchased from paint stores). Then, write a few artistic congratulatory words and each other's names in black ink inside the paper. This will become a generous and practical New Year's card. Moreover, the recipient can keep it as a souvenir because it is made by a novice.

In these difficult times, we should save wherever we can. Therefore, I hope children can imitate this in their spare time, so they can save money for other uses.

### Little Science

— Ci Kai

Things with pointed feet like cameras need at least three feet to stand steadily. Because: "Three points determine a plane."

The floor is a horizontal plane, the wall is a vertical plane, and the slide is an inclined plane. If you remove two feet from the camera, and the tips of the feet touch the wall and the slide, it means that the two points of the foot tips can be arbitrarily joined on any plane. If there are three feet that can all "touch the ground," and you move it horizontally, if you want them all to touch the wall or the slide, one of them will always not fit. Because these three points have already determined a "horizontal" plane; once the plane is determined, it will not fall over.

### The Blue Dwarf (13)

— Ai Li

Although Ah Li was not a timid girl, her heart was filled with terrifying thoughts at this moment. However, in such a dark night and in such a dark forest, not only could she not see any of her relatives, but she couldn't even see a single person. Naturally, it was easy to make her nervous. In this summer season, she thought there wouldn't be wolves, but there might be bears attacking her. At this moment, the sound of birds chirping in the distance, intermittently reaching her ears, also made her secretly startled. Suddenly, a bat flew by and happened to hit her shoulder, which scared her even more.

She groped in the dark for a long time, still not knowing which way to go. She kept bumping into tree trunks, clearly not finding a path and still lost in the depths of the forest. Ah Li walked another distance, still unable to get out of the forest, so she sat down on the ground and couldn't help but cry loudly. After crying for a while, she thought of the stories she had read before, which said that some people who were lost could find their way with a compass, but unfortunately she didn't have a compass on hand. But then she thought, in such darkness all around, even if she had a compass, she wouldn't be able to see the cardinal directions, so where could she find a path?

Just when Ah Li was in despair, she suddenly saw a little light, a tiny light, flickering through the many trees. She wondered if it was a star or a firefly? But stars don't fall from the sky, and fireflies aren't that big. It was clearly a light, and it was coming towards her step by step. She didn't know whether she was surprised or happy in her heart. She had already resigned herself to this little life, thinking that she would just starve to death or be bitten to death by a bear. She never expected to find a way out of desperation and that someone would come to save her. She looked earnestly at the location of the light, which was indeed getting closer and closer, and she could already see that it was a lamp being carried by a person; this person was short, seemingly a child. Ah Li's heart thumped involuntarily, thinking that this child, could it be her younger brother Ah Li? But then she thought, it couldn't be Ah Li. In this time before dawn, her uncle and aunt would never let Ah Li come out to look for her. But looking at the way he looked, he was clearly a child. Ah Li didn't care who it was and shouted first, "Hey, come and save me! I'm lost in the forest!"

The lamp flickered in the darkness for a while, then shone towards Ah Li, getting closer. Then, it made a surprised sound and said, "Huh, who is it?" Ah Li looked intently, suspecting that she was still dreaming. It turned out that the person, although not wearing blue clothes, was short in stature, clearly a dwarf! She looked closely at his face again and suddenly remembered. Seeing his bright eyes, she knew that this person was the dwarf old man she and Ah Li had seen earlier in the hotel window.

### Mussolini Loves Watching Movies

— Hua Zhi

Mussolini is also a movie fan.

Before he entered the political arena, he spent many days of the year immersed in movie theaters. After becoming prominent, he still maintained a strong interest, often wearing plain clothes and secretly leaving the Palazzo Venezia to go to movie theaters, sitting in the back row, without anyone knowing who he was. When the Prime Minister's shadow appeared on the screen, the audience stood up and cheered, and he would do the same with everyone, enjoying himself.

Italian literature and art have always been famous, but the film industry is very backward. This spring, Mussolini specially ordered his eldest son to organize a "Film Script Review Committee," offering a reward of 100,000 Italian lire to solicit excellent scripts from all over the world, with content that was anti-communist and promoted fascism, preparing to do it on a large scale. People who are qualified to apply must be from countries that signed the Anti-Comintern Pact; works from other countries will be rejected. But before the script even reached the final review, the countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact had all dispersed like birds and beasts, making peace with each other. Mussolini was inevitably quite disappointed.

Before the outbreak of this European war, Mussolini once met with Hitler. The two talked about the rise and fall of film art. Hitler mentioned that the Nazi Party's film company was putting the famous German song "Lorelei" on the screen, costing tens of millions of marks. The scenery was striving for magnificence and grandeur, and it was preparing to use "sexy" shots for the first time, etc. Mussolini fully supported it at the time and was willing to designate a piece of East African colony as the location for the film's outdoor scenes. Just as the two sides were about to start cooperating, war suddenly broke out, and they had to urgently prepare for war. Mussolini's film business was also declared to be stranded.

### Joan Crawford, Star of "Woman," Talks About New Clothes

— Xin Liang

Listen to Women in Strange and Gorgeous Clothes

"Women spend a lot of money on clothing in order to dress beautifully," Hollywood's famous female star, Joan Crawford, told people. "Women probably have this idea, that the more expensive the clothes, the more fashionable and modern they must be. But in fact, that's not the case. Many times, as long as the clothes fit and suit the personality, then even those plain and simple clothes are quite pleasing to the eye. When women know that beautiful clothes don't have to cost a lot of money, how happy they should be in their hearts."

This red star continued to say to people, "Actors, because they want to stand out and make themselves look like a 'star' at all times, they are willing to spend most of their salary on making all kinds of novel clothes. Undoubtedly, their concept is wrong."

"I can say very frankly that the clothes I wear are still made three years ago. I absolutely oppose discarding clothes that can still be worn and are not very old; I also know that women's clothes change every year, but it doesn't matter, as long as you can modify them and modify them creatively, then we can definitely make full use of the existing old clothes."

Miss Crawford also solemnly said that every piece of clothing should be practical, durable, and comfortable.

"Even if you wear the most fashionable and popular clothes, but if they don't fit your figure and are not practical, then even if you wear them, you will still feel stiff, uncomfortable, and ugly."

Finally, she also told us that her clothes cost an average of $16.50 each, and her shoes cost $7.50 a pair. Of course, when there are banquets or dances to attend, her clothes are always a little more expensive.

Ideal Novel

### Chaplin's Dream

— Bai Di

Winter has already arrived, and the biting cold wind pours down from the sky in gusts. The bare tree branches are swayed by the wind, making a mournful sigh.

Chaplin returned home from the film studio, the day's work leaving him exhausted. Although he had already gone to bed, the excitement in his heart prevented him from calming down. Because the culmination of his months of hard work—"The Dictator"—would soon be completed. He felt that this was sacred work, and millions of movie fans around the world were eager for the early release of this film.

He went to bed, took a small amount of sleeping pills, and then fell soundly asleep.

Suddenly, a voice rang out in his dream. It was a rude roar. The voice said:

——Stop your work! Foolish man! Many people in the world are not satisfied with your work. They all hate you, like they hate a warrior! And they will immediately destroy your work, even destroy your life!

But another voice began, a weak cry, filled with misery and misfortune.

——Dear Sir, continue your work! Most of the oppressed people in the world support your work. Moreover, they see a glimmer of dawn in your work. Sir, we will use all our strength to be your strong backing! Complete your work, and all the righteous people in the world will thank you!

A third voice rang out. This was a voice full of justice, determination, and courage. It said:

——That's right! Most of the oppressed people in the world will support you. Don't listen to the evil curses of those demons! Take courage, gather all your courage, and persist in your work for justice! Because this is the path that points to light and freedom

The clock on the wall struck three times, and Chaplin sat up straight from his dream and said to the enlarged photograph hanging on the wall,

"Yes, I will bravely persevere."

### Mysterious Girl Tan Ying Left for Hong Kong the Day Before Yesterday

— Xiong Jian

Xinhua is cooperating with Hong Kong's Nan Yue Company to promote the South China market and make films in Hong Kong, distributing both Mandarin and Cantonese copies. In the past, works such as "Tears of Rouge" and "The Weaver Girl Descending to Earth" were products of this cooperation. Recently, Xinhua officials plan to film the story of the Green Screen Mountain from the Water Margin: "Shi Xiu and Pan Qiaoyun," and decided to take advantage of Wang Yin's presence in Hong Kong filming "Peerless Beauty" to have Wang Qian direct the film. All the main characters have also been assigned, with Wang Yin playing Shi Xiu and the role of Pan Qiaoyun played by the "Mysterious Girl" Tan Ying. Tan Ying has not acted for a long time, but this role is quite suitable for her personality, and it is predicted that she will receive good reviews. After Wang Yin went to Hong Kong, he once returned to Shanghai to collect materials for the play. Now, Tan Ying has already set sail for Hong Kong on the French President Doumer ship the day before yesterday (the 14th). Once she arrives in Hong Kong and the script is written, filming will begin.
