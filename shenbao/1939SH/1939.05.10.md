Disclosure by Finance Ministry Spokesperson

### Another Conspiracy by the Japanese Puppets to Disrupt Finances; No One Willing to Accept "Huaxing" Counterfeit Currency; Foreign Businesses to Protect Their Own Interests Will Continue to Support Chinese Legal Tender

(Chongqing) When meeting with Chinese and foreign reporters on the 9th, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance expressed the following views on the establishment of the "Huaxing Commercial Bank" by the Japanese puppets in China. After the enemy's attempt to undermine our currency system by establishing the puppet United Reserve Bank in North China failed, they are now trying to implement the same conspiracy in Central China by establishing the so-called Huaxing Commercial Bank. However, this conspiracy will also end in failure. This new financial conspiracy of the enemy is obviously a preliminary strategy to attempt to implement a financial system centered on Shanghai. However, the stability of the financial system in Shanghai is closely related to the vital interests of foreigners. If the enemy's control attempt is realized, it will not only deal a major blow to the interests of foreigners in Central China, but also reflect the fact that the enemy's finances have reached a dead end. The enemy is in urgent need of money to pay for war expenses and support puppet organizations, and has exhausted all methods to collect money in its military occupation areas. The purpose of establishing the bank in North China was to force the people to use non-convertible and worthless paper money. Now that the enemy's looting in North China has reached its limit, but it is still in urgent need of money, it has turned its target to Central China. The new bank planned by the enemy is a commercial bank, and it is said that half of its capital is borne by enemy banks and half by the puppet government. Given the past failure of counterfeit currency in North China, it can be asserted that unless forced by the enemy's military force, no one will be willing to accept the paper money to be issued by this new counterfeit bank. Although the enemy uses deceptive words, its new conspiracy will still fail, because the public knows the truth of the facts very well. Our government will take appropriate countermeasures, which goes without saying. If it is said that foreign banks will accept the new counterfeit banknotes, or accept deposits from the new counterfeit bank, or engage in other transactions with it, no one believes it. For the sake of their own interests and the interests of the public, all foreign banks will continue to support our country's currency system. Moreover, in November 1933, the British government announced that China's national currency was the only legal currency for British transactions in China. It is expected that all relevant foreign circles will take appropriate actions to protect their own interests. At the same time, foreign governments will also protest to the Japanese authorities against this new financial conspiracy of the Japanese side. (9th dispatch)

(Chongqing) A spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance commented today on the establishment of a Sino-Japanese joint venture bank in Central China, saying that the United Reserve Bank established by the Japanese in North China has failed, and now they are trying to perform the same trick in Central China, which will undoubtedly repeat the same mistakes. Japan's new financial plan clearly attempts to forcibly control the financial system centered on Shanghai by the Japanese. The security of this system is of great importance to the interests of foreigners. If it is controlled, it will cause serious damage to the interests of foreigners in Central China and throughout China. The Chinese government has no choice but to take countermeasures, which are currently under discussion. (9th Reuters dispatch)

Editorial

### Japan and the German-Italian Alliance

In our previous commentary on the evolving international situation, we recognized the brewing turbulence and its far-reaching impact, which could not be ignored for even a moment. However, we also felt that we could at least allow ourselves a week or even half a month of quiet observation to watch the changes unfold. Unexpectedly, in just these three days, extraordinary phenomena have emerged, seemingly indicating that new developments will follow one after another.

In these three days: the agreement between Britain and Turkey is reported to have been definitively established, and France is about to join. This is a militarily crucial element of the European democratic nations. The Anglo-Soviet negotiations, which were previously viewed as having stalled due to the departure of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, and whose future seemed exceptionally bleak and uncertain, have now been continued by British Ambassador to Moscow Sir Seeds and the new Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The content of the talks is being kept strictly confidential by both parties. The Soviet side is maintaining a deep and reserved demeanor, while the British and French sides are spreading optimistic reports. We have no way of knowing the actual situation, and we do not need to predict whether it will be auspicious or ominous. However, this is an exceptionally important development in the making, and once revealed, it will certainly be seen as an important factor in the future international situation. Given the reasons for the replacement of the Soviet Foreign Minister and the immediate continuation of talks after the replacement, it can be predicted that the unveiling is not far off. These two events are major events of the past few days and are indeed what we call extraordinary phenomena. However, the decision of Germany and Italy to conclude a political and military alliance, and the corresponding diplomatic activities of Britain and Japan, have the potential to promote a brand new development in the international situation, which is now an extraordinary foreshadowing.

The conclusion of a political and military alliance between Germany and Italy can be interpreted in various ways: 1. Strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact; 2. Eliminating the anti-communist slogan; 3. Proof of the past superficial harmony between the two countries; 4. Reinforcing the collusion between the two countries in aggression; 5. The two countries have in fact been allied for a long time, and now they are showing off for demonstration purposes; 6. Retreating in the face of difficulty, unable to find a solution, and using this as a cover; 7. Reversing course and making a last-ditch effort in desperation, a final preparation; 8. Demonstrating the firm and resolute intentions of the two countries to Japan in response to Japan's wavering attitude. All of these have very different meanings, and the causes and consequences are different. It is difficult to say at this moment to which it actually belongs. It is like a couple who have been living together openly for a long time, have been living together for a long time, and have children. Suddenly they announce their decision to marry. It cannot be said that it is not a new fact. It can be said that there is a new reason. It can be said that it is a natural procedure and a natural result. What is the purpose, we can only wait for the facts to explain later. However, the impact has caused both Britain and Japan to be alarmed. Britain is developing its consistent diplomatic style. Japan is deliberately showing restraint, showing that it will wait for the price and sell itself, and will choose people and serve them. As far as Britain is concerned: it is determined to unite with the Soviet Union, but it is reluctant to give the Soviet Union any kind of support for the contradictions and crises between the Soviet Union and Japan. This is one aspect. The close relationship between Germany and Italy has reached this stage. However, Britain has not completely abandoned the idea of ​​differentiation and appeasement. At the same time, it is working hard to organize an anti-aggression group to confront it. This is another aspect. In China, its rights and interests are being severely exploited; in the occupied areas of China, there is an anti-British action led by Japan; the ambassador who occasionally goes to Chongqing enjoys a full performance by the Japanese Air Force; the anti-British propaganda and anti-British movement in Japan are pressing; however, the British diplomatic authorities indicated to the Japanese envoys stationed in Britain, praising Japan for not being tempted by the German-Italian military alliance, and "frankly" informing them of the content of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, that is, Britain refused to accept the Soviet Union's proposals regarding the Far East, that is, the British newspapers also used implicit words regarding the possibility of Anglo-Japanese rapprochement, saying that the British authorities have long had this desire, saying that Japan's actions are gradually tilting in this direction; this is another aspect. Each aspect can show the exquisite and transparent nature of British diplomacy. We have always praised Britain's diplomatic style for planning its national affairs well in response to the international environment. However, how much has the international situation been affected by Britain's diplomatic style? At the beginning of the European War and after the September 18th Incident, if British diplomacy had been stronger, Germany's defeat might not have been so tragic, and Japan's self-entrapment might not have been so deep: and the sacrifices of those who interacted with Germany and Japan would not have been so great.

As far as Japan is concerned: Although it has repeatedly made informal expressions of refusing to participate in the German-Italian military alliance. In fact, it is still worried about gains and losses and is half-hearted; its subjective free control and objective hesitation also form a "fifty-fifty" division. This is because those who are cautious and those who are radical in Japan cannot reconcile at least on the issue of German-Italian relations. Why is this? It is said that the views, ideas, and desires are different, and Mo Ning said that it is because everyone lacks confidence and grasp. Only because of lack of confidence and grasp, it is expected to be entangled in the international community. Entanglement is beneficial or harmful, capable or incapable, and both positive and negative are not controlled by oneself. Looking at Ambassador Shigemitsu, who rushes to the door of Halifax; Ambassador Oshima, who runs between Ribbentrop and Ciano; and his Minister of the Army, Itagaki, who said that Japan could not join the German-Italian military alliance; and Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso, who said that it depends on Germany and Italy understanding Japan; and his spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who did not answer reporters' inquiries. In various forms, is it that Japan also has its established national policy, which is only unfathomable to others? It must not be so. However, there is one comprehensive explanation that can be given to their national policy, that is, what they call anti-communism, or what they call not anti-democracy, or what they call not being in the ranks of omnipotent countries, or what they call pro-Britain and the United States, or what they call pro-Germany and Italy, or even what they call should be pro-Soviet, all of which are not related to reason, emotion, or belief; it is important to know that Japan has been fighting hard in China for more than 20 months, and there is no way to extricate itself. How can it be leisurely and talk about what is pro or estranged? There is something called approval and opposition; their only problem and only national policy at present is to seek how it can be beneficial to them in China. It is said that for Germany and Italy, and even for Britain and the Soviet Union. Everything must be centered on their so-called China problem. Holding Germany and Italy to demand Britain, and demanding Britain to alienate the Soviet Union, how can they ask the ding of Europe!

### Japanese Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Chongqing, Arousing Strong Reactions; Sichuanese Grind Their Teeth at the Cruelty of the Japanese, Shout Love and Support for Chairman Chiang; British Ambassador to Japan Ordered to Protest

(Chongqing) Since Japanese planes bombed civilians in Chongqing on May 3rd and 4th, all Party, government, and military organs, under the instructions and guidance of Chairman Chiang, have been mobilized to relocate and shelter the affected people, treat the wounded, collect the dead, restore traffic, and reorganize the disaster areas in an intense and orderly manner.  As a reporter, I have been observing the situation daily and deeply recognize that the government and the people share each other's sorrows, support each other in illness, and console each other in death. They have fully demonstrated the spirit of sincere unity in resisting aggression and building the nation. What is especially moving is that Chairman Chiang personally inspected the disaster areas on the 9th. The disaster-stricken people paid their respects and cheered all along the way. Some shouted to support the central government that saves the country and the people, some shouted love and support for the leader who saves the country and the people, and some shouted that the more cruel the enemy is, the stronger we will be. Some were even so moved that they wept. Chairman Chiang offered brief condolences to the disaster victims along the way and earnestly exhorted the service teams of the Party, government, and military to work hard.  The reporter happened to pass by at that time, and after Chairman Chiang left, I inquired with the people, who unanimously expressed their gratitude to Chairman Chiang for loving the people like his own children. At the same time, they pointed their fingers and glared, saying that the enemy's indiscriminate bombing only destroyed their property but could not destroy their spirit of resisting aggression. They vowed to avenge this great hatred. On the way back, the reporter met a certain important figure of the central government and told him about the inspection by Chairman Chiang. The important figure smiled and said, "The enemy is spreading rumors that Chairman Chiang has gone to Chengdu and that the central government will also leave Chongqing. You have personally seen Chairman Chiang among the people. The enemy's bombing of civilians in Chongqing is enough to show that their invasion plan has reached its end. To fabricate such rumors even more shows that their rumor-mongering skills have also reached their end. Chairman Chiang's diligence in Chongqing in caring for the people's suffering, you have already seen. The central government has absolutely no intention of moving, which I deeply know. The enemy's rumor-mongering skills stop here, pitiful and laughable. They do not even consider themselves and broadcast it widely, thinking they are afraid they are not deceiving enough people, but in reality, they are advertising their own poverty and ugliness." Not only that, but the surroundings of consulates and churches of various countries stationed in Chongqing are all civilians. This is well known to people of various countries in Chongqing, but the enemy still tries to fabricate excuses to shirk responsibility, claiming that there are military installations. This is something people of various countries deeply know to be false and is not just something we despise. The reporter is pleased to have personally witnessed Chairman Chiang's demeanor in this trip, to have deeply recognized the spirit of unity between the top and bottom, and to have exposed the enemy's exhausted rumor-mongering skills. Therefore, I put down my pen to record it. (9th dispatch)

(Chongqing) Since Chongqing suffered from the Japanese planes'狂炸, on the one hand, a large number of residents have been enthusiastically evacuated, and on the other hand, the government authorities have been actively providing relief. Chairman Chiang personally instructed to allocate hundreds of government vehicles, including his own, as transportation for evacuating refugees. Therefore, vehicles carrying refugees in and out are continuously moving, day and night. As of yesterday, the number of refugees moved out has reached more than 200,000. In addition, machinery, furniture, cotton, paper, etc., are also being transported away from Chongqing. Currently, there is only one newspaper in Chongqing, and its size has been greatly reduced. However, several newspapers may resume publication within a few days. This is the result of the bombing, with two newspaper offices completely destroyed and four suffering significant damage. As for the government, it has decided not to relocate. The ministries and departments that should be evacuated have already implemented evacuation several months ago. Those who are now stationed in Xindu will not move under any circumstances. Several schools have already been evacuated, and all hospitals have also been moved to safe areas. Seven temporary hospitals are being established nearby in the countryside to accommodate wounded soldiers and civilians. In addition, the government has allocated 1 million yuan to relieve this great disaster. Each refugee is given 5 yuan in Chinese currency, and those who are destitute and homeless are given 30 yuan. Refugee shelters are being built outside the city to actively accommodate them, and special relief teams are being organized to help the elderly and the weak. Several shops in Chongqing reopened yesterday, but there is a lack of all essential supplies because the commercial center has been completely destroyed. The total number of deaths, injuries, and material losses is currently not accurately counted. It is estimated that no less than 3,000 people died in the disaster, and the property loss is incalculable. Although air raid alarms were still frequent yesterday, no Japanese planes were seen. This is because the Chongqing authorities have strengthened air defense measures, and Japanese planes only dropped bombs on nearby towns before escaping. Banks in Chongqing resumed business yesterday, and shops opened in the evening, with enthusiastic shoppers. (9th dispatch, Hai Tong News Agency)

(Chongqing) Regarding the losses from the Japanese air raid on Chongqing last Thursday, no official statistics have been released to date. However, according to recent estimates, there were 1,500 deaths, and no less than 5,000 people suffered losses. Most of the streets have been swept and cleaned. Machinery and printing presses are being transported away from Chongqing, and many newspaper offices are also relocating. It is reported that there is currently only one newspaper in Chongqing. (9th dispatch, Hai Tong News Agency)

(London) The Times published an editorial today entitled "The Massacre of Chongqing," stating that the Japanese attack on Chongqing, carried out in densely populated residential areas of the city, resulted in almost all civilians being victimized, a large portion of whom were buried in flames. This kind of large-scale massacre is unprecedented, and the Japanese air force will carry out even larger attacks in the future. A year or two ago, several countries still believed that it would be beneficial to protest to Japan in the name of humanity and civilization against its intentional barbaric acts against civilians. But today, the world knows more details. The modern Japanese attitude towards Bushido clearly considers Bushido as fixed but should not interfere with acts of war. The Chongqing air raid is a particularly egregious event. Japan's desire to create terror among the people through acts of massacre is fully evident here. Chongqing has no value for bombing other than providing an excellent opportunity to destroy civilian lives. What is strange is that Japan still believes in the effectiveness of this kind of action. In fact, Japan should have known long ago that bombs are not enough to intimidate the Chinese people but only strengthen their determination to resist aggression. (9th dispatch, Reuters)

(London) The Manchester Guardian published an essay today commenting on China's resistance war and paying attention to the air raid on Chongqing, stating that in an unjust war, the Japanese may think that killing a thousand Chinese people is not necessarily morally worse than killing a hundred or one person. But in reality, we have to judge the good or evil of actions based on their impact on human happiness or human suffering. According to this standard, the enormous suffering of the Chinese people is still the most important and terrifying issue among our current major problems. (9th dispatch, Reuters)

(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang personally visited the temporary shelters where refugees displaced by the Japanese air raids on the city on May 3rd and 4th were residing, inspected them for a week, and the refugees cheered endlessly after hearing Chairman Chiang's words of encouragement, and many shouted to support Chairman Chiang and that they would never surrender until death. The local authorities officially declared that rumors that Chairman Chiang had gone to Chengdu and that the National Government was considering moving to Chengdu or Kunming were all inaccurate. (9th dispatch, Reuters)

(London) Regarding the Japanese planes bombing the British consulate in Chongqing, the government has instructed Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British ambassador to Japan, to formally protest to the Japanese government. (9th dispatch, Havas)

(London) British Ambassador to Japan Sir Archibald Clark Kerr has been instructed to protest to the Japanese government regarding the bombing of the British Consulate General in Chongqing by Japanese planes. Reuters heard that the British government's instructions to Clark Kerr only mentioned the damage suffered by British property, but Clark Kerr has already urged the Japanese government to pay attention to the excessive nature of the Japanese bombing of Chongqing on Thursday from a humanitarian point of view. (9th dispatch, Reuters)

### Japan Strictly Controls Foreign Exchange; Several Foreigners Arrested for Violating Regulations

(Tokyo) Asahi Shimbun reported that those who obtain foreign currency checks and drafts in Japan and take them to China can exchange them for Japanese yen at a rate nearly twice as high as the "strictly set exchange rate" within Japan. In order to end this so-called "exchange trading," Japanese police officers are stepping up the arrest of foreigners and others suspected of taking advantage of this situation. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department revealed that it has detained two foreigners of Balkan nationality for more than two weeks and is interrogating three foreign missionaries in order to obtain information about this incident. Although the amount of exchanged funds has not been announced, the police claimed that although warnings were issued frequently, strict currency control regulations were implemented, making it impossible to obtain US dollars, British pounds, or francs in Japan for trading purposes. However, there are still many people who receive remuneration from overseas traveling between Japan and Shanghai, exchanging checks from themselves and their friends for cash based on the market price of Japanese yen in Shanghai. Now this restriction is becoming tighter. The Japanese Ministry of Finance has recently ordered banks and travel agencies to refuse to sell foreign currency and traveler's checks to travelers going to Shanghai. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department recently arrested Father Corrat, a 38-year-old Catholic priest, for violating the new exchange regulations. Two days later, Baron Peyans, a 70-year-old Belgian reporter for Le Figaro in Paris, was also arrested shortly after returning to Japan from Shanghai. It is said that both have been interrogated in detail after their arrest. (9th dispatch, Reuters)

### British Prime Minister During the European War Strongly Advocated British-Soviet Cooperation to Stop Aggression; Japan's Extension of Power Severely Threatens British Territories; Not Far From the Indian Border, Enough to Cause Trouble

During the House of Commons debate on the military training bill today, Lloyd George stated that he was bound to support the government, but he believed that the actual number of people called up was too small. Lloyd George reiterated that it is now imperative to reach a compromise with the Soviet Union, saying that the number of people Germany and Italy can place on the battlefield is twice the number that France, Poland, and Britain can place. Without the help of the Soviet Union, the guarantees given by Britain to Poland, Romania, and Greece would be difficult to fulfill. Moreover, Japan is now seeking hegemony from afar, controlling everything. During the European War, Britain obtained 1 million Indian troops, and France obtained 500,000 Vietnamese troops. Now that Japan is our enemy, how can we make up for this deficiency without Soviet assistance? (8th dispatch, Reuters)

(London) Lloyd George's speech briefly stated: "I have repeatedly asked the government to deal with a strong attitude towards all countries that destroy the independence and freedom of our allies. Moreover, in principle, it can be said that there are very few democratic countries on the European continent that do not implement conscription. In terms of quantity, the Soviet Red Army has the largest land army formed by conscription in the world. In terms of quality, the French army has always been the most elite. Britain should catch up quickly. As for the relationship between the Far Eastern situation and Europe, we have always regarded Japan as an outsider. The Japanese authorities have repeatedly stated that they do not want to advise on European affairs, nor do they intend to send troops to assist the Axis powers in the war. What they are concerned about is only the Far East. People who have not thought deeply about this kind of statement often find it comforting. In fact, if we look at the map, we will know that Japan's advance is like a long spear pointed at the border of British territories. Since the establishment of the Hiranuma Cabinet, the Japanese army has advanced towards India by 200 miles and is no longer far from India. However, during the last European War, our country transferred 1 million fresh troops from India to defend Egypt, Palestine, and Iraq, while France also transferred 500,000 fresh troops from Vietnam and other territories. It can be seen that the Far Eastern territories of Britain and France are very important in national defense. Japan is an enemy country, and if we allow it to expand its power in Asia, we will let it become the greatest threat to the British Empire." Lloyd George concluded, "After Britain recently accepted all kinds of commitments from Eastern European countries, the Soviet Union should join the anti-aggression group so that Britain can fully fulfill its promises."

### British House of Commons Questions Far Eastern Events; Government Pays Attention to Protecting the Interests of British Nationals at All Times

(London) Conservative MP Morgan raised a question today regarding the newly established "Central Bank" in Nanjing, saying, "The British government does not recognize this currency by all merchants and traders. Are we going to take steps to protect the trade of British citizens?" Butler replied that the British government is already consulting with the Japanese government on this matter. Conservative MP Graham continued to ask, "Can British merchants and property owners in Nanjing return to that place? If they cannot, what actions will the government take?" Butler replied that the number of passes issued by the Japanese to British citizens to return to Nanjing is extremely limited. The British side has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese authorities regarding the number of these passes and the conditions for their issuance. The British government believes that the Japanese authorities governing the area must be responsible for the safety of British citizens' property in Nanjing. The British interests there are currently being attended to by the resident consular staff. Graham asked further, "Has the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, recently visited Qingdao? Has he written a report on the difficulties faced by British citizens in operating businesses under the obstruction of the Japanese?" Butler replied that the government has not received any special reports or suggestions, but detailed information about the situation there is available at all times. There is currently a consul general stationed in that place. (8th dispatch, Reuters)

### London and Tokyo Diplomatic Contacts; Review of British-Japanese Relations; Japanese Ambassador Kioi Shigemitsu Criticizes British Aid to China; Britain Points Out that Japan is Endangering British Interests in China

(London) Japanese Ambassador to Britain Kioi Shigemitsu hosted a banquet at the embassy last night for British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax. Those invited to accompany him included Foreign Office official Butler, French Ambassador Corbin, and the Danish and Dutch envoys and the American Consul General. British former Ambassador to Japan Lindsay was also invited. After the banquet, Kioi Shigemitsu held a long conversation with Halifax to continue the consultations conducted a few days ago to review British-Japanese relations. According to Hái Tōng Shè from informed sources, Halifax told Shigemitsu about the progress and prospects of the British-Soviet negotiations, expressing the hope that Japan would also inform Britain of the negotiations with Germany and Italy with the same frankness. In the conversation, Shigemitsu complained about Britain's assistance to China, saying that this assistance "benefits the Soviet Union in the Far East more than Chairman Chiang." On the other hand, Halifax solemnly stated the British government's concerns about Japan's actions in China, affirming that the British government considers the issuance of new currency by the Japanese authorities to be

### Japan's National Mobilization Bill to be Implemented in Full; Lack of Unified Command between the Army and Navy; War Against China Increasingly Entrenched in Difficulties

(Tokyo) According to official sources today, Japan intends to fully implement Japan's National Mobilization Bill in order to end its war against China and to unify the command of the Japanese army and navy. After the full implementation of the National Mobilization Bill, Japan will be placed under extremely strict control, and all public and private activities will be subject to strict supervision and regulation. As for the need for unified command between the army and navy, this is because the two not only cannot cooperate recently but often contradict the government's important policies. Therefore, unless a solution to the "China Incident" can be obtained immediately, the unification of the army and navy will no longer be delayed. As for the National Mobilization Bill, it will be promoted regardless of everything. The Japanese National Mobilization Bill was passed by the Japanese Parliament last year, and several parts have been implemented since July. However, in the past month, there have been 52,000 incidents of people violating the National Mobilization Bill. Although most of them are insignificant, 20% of them have been handed over to the law. At the same time, during these nine months, the agencies implementing the National Mobilization Act have been added one after another. The production and consumption of goods have been under government control. Profits have also been restricted. Labor wages and working hours have also been regulated. Strikes have become criminal acts. Workers must register and have the obligation to be conscripted for technical work at any time. Other activities, such as people's fuel consumption and other innumerable activities, are restricted. Recently, prices have also been controlled. This matter is now presided over by former Finance Minister Ikeda Seihin, whose agency is the Central Price Commission (translated). Its purpose is to prevent Japan's malignant inflation and the severe devaluation of the Japanese yen. The exchange rate of the Japanese yen has always been maintained by artificial methods. However, Japan's previous control over prices was not very effective. For example, coal has risen from 35 yen per ton to 85 yen. The prices of various clothes and shoes made with substitutes are comparable to those made with real materials in the past. The transportation fees charged by drivers have also become significantly more expensive. Land rent and housing rent have also increased. The police have no way to stop them.

a major threat to foreign interests in China. (9th dispatch, Reuters)

(Tokyo) According to Japanese Finance Minister Ishiwata Sotaro, Japan can develop China and "Manchukuo" even without foreign financial assistance. Japan's current material resources are still satisfactory, so Japan's industrial expansion plan will continue to be promoted. According to Ishiwata's statement to reporters, "We welcome foreign investment in the development of 'Manchukuo' and China, but in the current international environment, it is practically impossible to obtain significant foreign investment. Therefore, we do not consider this. Our current approach is still to seek development with our own strength." A reporter asked, "It has been reported that 'Manchukuo' is currently using American capital to develop its heavy industry. Is this true?" Ishiwata claimed that he was not aware of this. The reporter also asked whether the Japanese government's appointment of Nishiyama Taihei, director of the Yokohama Specie Bank, as the financial representative of Japan stationed in New York was for Japan to obtain foreign financial assistance. Ishiwata replied, "In the past, we had stationed a financial representative in London who concurrently managed the affairs of the United States and the United Kingdom. Later, we felt that this method was extremely inconvenient, so we also dispatched another person to New York to maintain closer contact with the United States and to make the American people understand Japan's economic status. But so far, we have not wanted them to have any concrete financial negotiations with financiers in New York." The reporter then asked, "There are often reports that Japan is severely lacking in material resources and unable to carry out large-scale industrial expansion. Is this true?" The Finance Minister replied that it was not true. "Generally speaking, Japan's material preparations have not decreased, so we will still implement the original industrial expansion plan." He also said that the government is currently considering establishing a Ministry of Trade to promote foreign trade. He went on to say that since setting aside 300 million yen for the foreign exchange equalization fund last year, it has been quite convenient to use. Ishiwata admitted that part of this fund has been used to purchase military materials. He also said, "We will continue to expand the 'linked currency' system so that we can obtain more raw materials for manufacturing export products. We hope this method can increase our foreign trade." The reporter then asked when Japan could abolish import controls and foreign exchange controls. The Finance Minister smiled and did not answer. (9th dispatch, Associated Press)

### British Shipping: War Risk Insurance Premiums Reduced

(London) A major reduction in war risk insurance premiums for shipping was announced tonight. The main change is that the additional premium for passing through the Mediterranean or the Baltic Sea has been reduced from 20 shillings to 12 shillings and 6 pence per 100 pounds. According to a certain authority in the insurance industry interviewed by Reuters, the reason for the change in premiums is that the insurance association believes that the overall situation has gradually become stable and that premiums can be reduced.

### Soviet Concern for the Eastern European Situation: Diplomatic Strategy Remains Consistent; Strengthening Relations with Poland and Romania; Britain Proposes Counter-Proposal to Anti-Aggression Organization

Regarding the new counter-proposal for the organization of an anti-aggression bloc submitted by the British government, it was delivered to the new Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today by the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds. Diplomatic sources here recently stated that there is sufficient reason to believe that this new counter-proposal can be accepted by the Soviet Union, and that the country's foreign policy will not change due to the dismissal of the former People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov. Firstly, Soviet Ambassador Maisky provided a firm guarantee to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the country's current policy would not be altered. Secondly, Polish sources here stated that the Soviet government has already decided to appoint an ambassador to that country, indicating that the Soviet Union is eager to restore normal relations. Thirdly, after visiting Turkey and Bulgaria, the Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Potemkin, is now heading to Romania, indicating that the Soviet Union is eager to strengthen its influence in the Balkan countries and remains concerned about various European issues. As for the new counter-proposal put forward by Britain, although its content advocates that the Soviet Union should provide assistance to its neighboring countries, this assistance will only be implemented after Britain and France join the war. The British side believes that this new counter-proposal, even if it is revised in detail, can at least be expected to become the basis for a final agreement. (Havas, London, 8th)

(Moscow) British Ambassador Sir Seeds visited the new People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, this afternoon and had their first conversation, which lasted forty minutes and was interpreted by an interpreter. This was the first time Molotov has received a foreign envoy since taking over foreign affairs. (Havas, 8th)

(London) The detailed report of the talks held yesterday between the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, and the Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee and Foreign Minister, Molotov, has now been transmitted to London, and the government will give it careful consideration. According to speculation here, the Soviet government will seriously consider the opinions expressed by the British Ambassador during the talks, and a second round of talks could be held within a few days. (Reuters, 9th)

(Moscow) The British government's reply is a counter-proposal to Litvinov's proposal to conclude a tripartite alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, including the following two items: (1) The Soviet Union guarantees the five countries bordering the Soviet Union, namely Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Poland, and Romania; (2) If the Soviet Union is drawn into war as a result of the above guarantee, the British government will come forward to help. (Haitong, 9th)

(Moscow) After the meeting between British Ambassador Seeds and Molotov yesterday, the staff of the British Embassy felt quite optimistic, but refused to disclose the content of the talks. The general public believes that since the British and Soviet authorities have not issued a communiqué, there is still room for further talks between the two sides. (Havas, 9th)

Warsaw. British Ambassador to Poland, Sir Howard Kennard, yesterday visited Foreign Minister Colonel Beck to inform him of the counter-proposal submitted by the British government to the Soviet Russian government regarding the organization of an anti-aggression front. Its content advocates that when any of the Soviet Union's neighbors are invaded in the future, if Britain and France send troops to assist, the Soviet Union will do its best to guarantee their independence. This counter-proposal is very welcomed by the Polish side. In addition, Lithuanian Commander-in-Chief General Raštikis arrived here at noon today. Soviet Deputy People's Commissar Potemkin is also scheduled to come here from the Romanian capital today to hold talks with Foreign Minister Beck, which must be of particular significance, because the Soviet Union had issued a statement before that, stating that if the Baltic coastal countries, namely Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia, are invaded, it would be allowed to provide assistance. (Havas, 9th)

### Molotov's New Initiatives After Taking Office: Appointment of New Ambassador to Poland; Restoration of Normal Diplomatic Relations Between the Two Countries

Warsaw. Soviet Ambassador Davtyan has not returned to his post since returning to his country at the end of 1937. The Soviet government decided yesterday to appoint the former Minister to Greece, Sharonov, as the Ambassador to Poland and has obtained the consent of the Polish government. Foreign sources here said that this is a new initiative by the new Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, after taking office, and is of extreme importance in the current international situation. It can be seen from this that the Soviet government is eager to restore normal relations with Poland, which will surely be very satisfactory to the Polish authorities. (Havas, 8th)

Warsaw. The appointment of the former Soviet Minister to Greece, Sharonov, as Ambassador to Poland has been well-received by military and political figures here, who believe that relations between the Soviet Union and Poland have improved. The non-aggression treaty signed between the two sides in 1932 was renewed last November, and Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin will come here on this day, all of which shows that the Soviet Union is willing to establish good neighborly relations with Poland. (Havas, 9th)

Bucharest. The Soviet government's decision to appoint a new minister to Romania has recently been commented on by political figures here, saying that the relationship between the Soviet Union and Poland and Romania is closely linked in time. Since it has now decided to appoint a new ambassador to Poland, the vacancy for the minister to Romania will naturally not be left vacant for long. The Soviet Union's determination to focus on the situation in Eastern Europe can be seen from this. (Havas, 9th)

### Potemkin Returns Home; Via Warsaw; To Visit Foreign Minister Beck

Bucharest. Today, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin visited Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu and the two held talks for about two hours. It is reported that Potemkin wanted to dispel Romania's fear of Bolshevism in order to improve relations between the Soviet Union and Poland and the Soviet Union and Romania and restore all diplomatic exchanges. (Associated Press, 8th)

Warsaw. Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin is scheduled to arrive here from Bucharest at 11:30 tomorrow night, and will probably hold talks with Foreign Minister Beck immediately. Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Listobad visited Foreign Minister Beck this afternoon to make preparations, and will also go to the border tomorrow morning to meet him. (Havas, 8th)

(London) The Papal Representative to London, Archbishop Godfrey, visited Foreign Secretary Halifax the other day and reportedly suggested in the name of Pope Pius XII that a conference be held between representatives from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland to find a solution to the Danzig problem. Informed sources here commented that the Pope would only formally propose this suggestion after confirming that all the countries concerned agreed to it, and intended to convene the conference in the Vatican. Now, he is first trying to test the opinions of the British government to see if they would welcome it. In short, the Pope will study the reports sent by the envoys stationed abroad in the next few days, and then make a formal decision. (Havas, 9th)

### Military Alliance Issue: Japan Adopts Detached Attitude; Germany and Italy Plan to Exert Pressure to Force Japan to Comply; Negotiations Among the Three Governments Are Underway

German sources here recently stated that Japan's attitude towards the Axis countries is, from Germany's point of view, too detached. Germany and Italy have now decided to conclude a political and military treaty, which can influence Japan and urge it to change its original intentions. Regarding this, the governments of Germany, Italy, and Japan are in negotiations. The intention of Germany and Italy is to have Japan accept the restrictions of the treaty in military affairs. Up to now, that country has always been unwilling to interfere in European affairs, and has used the excuse that Germany and Italy have not concluded a military alliance treaty, and does not want to change the Anti-Comintern Pact into an alliance treaty. Now that Germany and Italy have concluded a political and military treaty, Germany can naturally use this opportunity to advise Japan to change its original attitude. (Havas, 8th)

(London) Diplomatic sources here are all asking about Japan's attitude towards the German-Italian Axis, and said that when the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy held talks in Milan the other day, Japan had no representative to participate, and it is unknown whether it is changing its attitude or observing the situation for the time being. According to reliable sources, although Japan has signed the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany and Italy, it still maintains freedom of action to a certain extent, and refuses to sign a military alliance treaty with those countries, because it does not want to accept restrictions, thereby forcing Britain and the Soviet Union to conclude an alliance treaty, and forcing the United States to become closer to the Western European countries. Germany and Italy reportedly strongly advised Japan, saying that if Britain and the Soviet Union establish an alliance treaty regardless of Japan's intentions, then Japan should resolutely sign a military alliance treaty with Germany and Italy. The Japanese side reportedly replied that it is not convenient to reveal in advance what Japan's attitude will be if this kind of situation occurs in the future. The implication is that it may not insist on dissenting to the proposal to join the German-Italian military alliance, but should still adopt a reserved attitude from now until then. Regarding this, although German sources in London said that the governments of Germany and Japan are continuing to contact each other, and there is a possibility of Japan and the German-Italian Axis becoming closer, Britain still hopes that Japan can handle things carefully to a certain extent. This can be seen from the fact that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie issued a statement to Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Horinouchi after the recent bombing of Chongqing by Japanese planes, saying that the British government should regard this matter as a serious case, but did not file a formal protest. However, diplomatic sources here said that the British government should file a formal protest in Geneva based on "humanitarianism," and no matter what excuses the Japanese side cites, it is not enough to defend this reckless and destructive air raid. (Havas, 8th)

### Arita's Speech

(Tokyo) When the National Governors Conference was held yesterday, Foreign Minister Arita addressed the meeting, detailing the recent developments in the European situation, saying that the Imperial Government felt it should strengthen the existing three-way anti-communist pact, so that it could cope with the international situation currently brewing from its own standpoint. Arita cited several examples of the remarkable progress made by Germany and Italy in the countries that are anti-communist, and then mentioned the activities of Britain and France in organizing a camp to surround Germany and Italy, and the fact that Britain and the Soviet Union are engaged in negotiations, hoping to invite the Soviet Union to join this camp, saying that Japan had to pay the greatest attention to Britain's proposal to invite the Soviet Union to join the British and French camp, not only because this matter affects the overall situation in the East. Arita then commented on President Roosevelt's proposal to Hitler and Mussolini to jointly guarantee European peace, saying that this proposal had attracted general attention because it contained a meaning of supporting Britain and France. However, it is believed that the United States' move has two purposes: (1) to make a gesture to the domestic audience; (2) to arouse public opinion against Germany and Italy, so that the United States does not have to directly resist Germany and Italy. Arita finally mentioned Japan's basic policy, saying that he firmly believed that the Imperial Government knew that if it wanted to restore the prosperity of the East, it could only achieve its goal by building the proposed "New Order in the East," and that the cooperation between Japan, "Manchukuo," and China could greatly benefit world peace. Arita concluded by saying that building a "New Order" in East Asia is Japan's historical and racial mission, and this mission originates from the great spirit of establishing the Japanese Empire.

### Eastern Report Commentary

(Tokyo) The tone of the Japanese newspapers all said that the conclusion of the German-Italian military agreement was caused by the encirclement policy of Britain and France, and took this opportunity to strongly advocate that Japan has the necessity to establish a firm policy to deal with the new situation. According to the observation of Jiji Shimpo, the encirclement policy of Britain and France is gradually being implemented, and the conclusion of the German-Italian military alliance is intended to effectively deal with this situation. Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the German-Italian agreement was to deal with the provocations of Britain and France, not to deal with Poland. The newspaper also believed that if Germany and Italy could prevent Britain and France's plan, a peaceful adjustment of the tense relations between Germany and Poland would not be impossible. Asahi Shimbun said that the Milan agreement had shattered Britain and France's hopes of alienating Germany and Italy. This agreement, no matter what, has proved that if war breaks out in Europe again, Italy will join the German side. The newspaper also said that this new agreement will further enhance the cooperation between the two countries and will have far-reaching effects, not only in Eastern Europe and the Balkans, but also in Spain. Chugai Commercial News stated that the conclusion of the German-Italian military agreement should be held jointly responsible by the encirclement policy of Britain and France. If the current negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union are successfully completed, the division between Britain and Germany and between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will become more obvious, and the situation in the Far East will be affected by the situation in Europe. The situation in Europe will continue to change due to the increasing conflict between Germany and Italy and between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. The newspaper also reiterated Prime Minister Hiranuma's speech at the Governors' Conference yesterday, emphasizing that Japan has the necessity to abandon the idea of maintaining the status quo in seeking a solution to the Sino-Japanese War, and urged the government to do its best to implement Japan's fixed and unchanging policy to cope with the new situation in Europe. Miyako Shimbun said that there is no doubt that the five ministers of Japan had discussed strengthening the anti-communist axis of Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo in successive meetings. The newspaper urged the government to formulate and announce its policy to reject the interference of Britain, France, and other pro-China countries in Chinese affairs, just as the joint efforts of Germany and Italy broke the encirclement policy of Britain and France. (Reuters, 9th)

### Details of the German-Italian Alliance: To Be Discussed; To Be Signed Next Month

(Rome) According to the Messaggero, the details of the German-Italian military agreement will be drafted in the next few weeks. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will meet again in early June to sign the document determining the scope and time limit of the mutual obligations of the two countries. The newspaper also said that this agreement will end the rumors of the collapse of the axis and the possibility of separation between Italy and Germany. Italy and its colonies and Germany form a group with 150 million people. In addition, the population of friendly countries must be added to this, which can show the true strength of the new alliance. (Reuters, 8th)

Milan. Yesterday, the German Foreign Minister made a statement regarding the German-Italian military alliance to German journalists at the Villa d'Este on Lake Como, as follows:

"The military alliance concluded by me and Ciano on behalf of Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini in Milan is the natural result of the situation that has existed for many years. Therefore, there is no change in the policies of the two countries. However, it is a clear testimony to the 'heroes of the pen' and 'war agitators' who are generally accustomed to spreading rumors, and at the same time announces to the world that all those who attempt to alienate the Axis countries will only be wasting their efforts." (Haitong, 9th)

(London) The Times recently published a dispatch from a correspondent stationed in Berlin, stating that after returning to Germany from Milan, Italy, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will go to Berchtesgaden to report on the trip to Führer Hitler. The content is reportedly that the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy had already agreed on how to deal with the issues of the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor, and had also agreed on a plan for the various demands made by Italy in the Mediterranean region. Now, they are in line with the wishes of both Germany and Italy. In addition, after the establishment of the German-Italian military political treaty, the two countries believe that a steel wall has been built from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Italian island of Sicily in the south. The German authorities will also vigorously publicize to the people of that country that the encirclement policy promoted by Britain has been broken. (Havas, 9th)

(Chongqing) The Chongqing United Daily, which is jointly published by ten local newspapers, today published an editorial commenting on the German-Italian military alliance and explaining the significance of Japan's failure to join the alliance, saying that the formation of this alliance was not unexpected, it is not enough to increase the power of the axis, and it weakens the position of the German-Italian-Japanese anti-communist pact. Japan's failure to join the military alliance is not because Germany and Italy intend to abandon Japan, but because Japan is afraid of being drawn into the European war. Because of the war in China, Japan has to adopt a passive action in international affairs. (Reuters, 9th)

### Expressing Feelings at a Battlefield, Windsor Calls for Peace, Hoping Political Leaders of All Nations Take Responsibility and Work Together for the World to Avert Disaster

After visiting the Verdun battlefield today, the Duke of Windsor broadcast an address to the Americas, stating that he was breaking his self-imposed silence because the crisis had become apparent and we may once again face the tragedy of 25 years ago. The Duke solemnly declared that his decision was solely based on his personal opinion as a soldier in the last war. He sincerely prayed that this brutal and destructive madness should never again overcome humanity. He believed that peace is a very important matter and should not be viewed as a political issue. In modern warfare, victory will go hand in hand with adverse forces and will inevitably lead to anarchy and chaos, with all people suffering the pain of displacement. This is true for Germany, as it is for Britain and France. There is still an opportunity to seek and discuss international understanding in a timely and thorough manner. Political tensions easily weaken the spirit of mutual compromise. In our personal contacts, we often strive for a harmonious life with our relatives and friends, otherwise civilization will never survive. If we cannot now apply what we apply to private matters to international affairs, are we going to destroy civilization? The Duke also strongly criticized harmful propaganda that poisons the will of the people, and said that he personally regretted the use of terms such as "encirclement" and "aggression" because they are enough to arouse the dangerous emotions that we should suppress. All actions of politicians engaged in restoring international security and trust must be based on the world as a prerequisite, and must not be limited by national prejudices. Any government's greatest success in establishing its national policy is insignificant compared to the victory gained by striving to avert the catastrophe that threatens today. The Duke added that he has no right to make any concrete suggestions, which must be left to those who have the power to guide all nations towards closer understanding. May God allow them to complete this great task in time, (Reuter, 8th)

(London) The Duke of Windsor's speech was not rebroadcast by any British radio station, and residents could only listen to it on French radio stations (Havas, 9th)

Toronto The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has announced that it will not broadcast the Duke of Windsor's speech. (Reuter, 8th)

### Japanese Troops Deploy 20,000-30,000 More Soldiers from Taiwan to Invade Guangdong, Heavy Attack on Heshan Fails, Still Preparing for Second Provocation

Hong Kong dispatch: Recently, the Japanese army in South China transferred 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers from Taiwan to Guangzhou. A portion of these troops were distributed from Guangzhou to the northeast, west, and three rivers area to increase defenses. At the same time, more than 10,000 troops concentrated in Shunde, Nanhai, and Xinhui, invading Heshan in multiple routes. Heshan is located in the southwest of Guangdong and holds strategic importance. By taking this, they can spy on Gaoming, encircle Zhaoqing, and control the waterways from Macau to the West River. Therefore, they have spared no effort in using a large number of troops for days, attacking Heshan City in three routes. The Chinese army considered this place a must-defend location and had already gathered forces, distributing them in various strategic points to meet the invading Japanese army with head-on blows. At the same time, 6,000 to 7,000 soldiers from Guangxi Province advanced along Guanping to Sanbu (Xinchang, Dihai, Changsha), with a part advancing to the Xinhui-Heshan highway to intercept the Japanese army invading westward from Xinhui. Since the 25th of last month, the Japanese army has been fiercely attacking Heshan City, one route along the Xinhui-Heshan road, with about 3,000 troops descending from Pingcangjing, and another landing at Danshui Estuary, peering into Heshan City from Kaiping. One route attacked the north of Heshan from Gulao and Shaping in Heshan territory, while another route detoured from Gulao to the Gaoyao-Gaoming highway, invading Gaoming. The battles on the above lines broke out simultaneously on the 25th. The battle in the northeast of Heshan was particularly fierce, with Heshan City changing hands several times. The military heart of this battle was in Jingang, Longyawei, and Kunlunjing in the northern suburbs of Heshan. Later, the Chinese reinforcements led by Deng Longguang and the Guangxi soldiers launched a major counterattack on the 30th, defeating the Japanese troops in the aforementioned areas in detail. By the 1st of this month, Japanese troops had disappeared from Heshan City. When a part of the Japanese army spied on the border of Gaoming from Gulao, the Chinese army gathered all its strength to meet the attack, and the main force of more than 3,000 Japanese troops was defeated in the Zhu Liuhe area. Since the Japanese army failed in the Heshan area and feared that the Chinese army would bypass Longkouwei along Jingang, they retreated hastily to Longkouwei without any intention of fighting. During the retreat, they bombed the Chinese army's pursuing troops with airplanes, and only then were they able to break through the encirclement and flee to Shaping. Currently, the Chinese army's frontline on the border of Heshan and Gaoming is solid, and the military strength is strong. The Japanese army is unlikely to invade again in the short term. In the battles of Zhu Liuhe, Kunlunjing, and Jingang, the Japanese army suffered more than 2,000 casualties. The remnants have retreated to Jiujiang, seemingly to replenish their forces.

Battle of Niowan Japanese Army Defeated

As for the Japanese army that invaded Heshan West via the Xinhui-Heshan Highway, it originally planned to join forces with the Japanese army in the Shaping area in Heshan, so that the Chinese army would be attacked from both the front and the rear. A certain division of the Chinese regular army had already been deployed there, and without waiting for the Japanese army to approach, they launched attacks on the Japanese army in Xinhui City. Fierce battles broke out on the 28th. On the 29th, a part of the Japanese army, about 2,000 people, was surrounded by Chinese troops in the Niowan area. The Japanese army struggled desperately, but was unable to break through. As a result, no fewer than 1,000 were defeated by the Chinese army, with hundreds killed and wounded. The Chinese army captured more than 20 Japanese soldiers and more than 40 war horses in this area. The remnants of the Japanese army are still stubbornly entrenched in Duwan to solidify the outer defense line of Xinhui City. As for the Jiangmen-Foshan road, after being injured in Jingang, a part of the Japanese army retreated to Haikou, crossed the river back to Jiujiang, and a part retreated to Tangxia in the southern section of the Jiangmen-Foshan road to await reinforcements.

Xinkai and Xinhe Roads Relaxed

The Japanese army invading Kaiping Danshui Estuary was intended as a containment force, with only 400 to 500 troops. After landing at Danshui Estuary, they divided and harassed Shenxianshi, Baimishi, Hegu, and Zhishan, attempting to attack the south gate of Heshan City. On the 25th, they approached the outskirts of the city via Baimitian and Hegu for the second time, and engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army more than 12 li outside the south gate, holding out for a day and night. Later, after the Chinese army counterattacked, they fled to the shore. The situation on the Xinkai and Xinhe roads has since become relaxed. The atmosphere in Taishan Gongyi Port is also not as tense as it was yesterday. However, after the 29th of last month, after the Japanese army transferred from Taiwan to Guangzhou, a part of the troops (about two divisions) have been transferred to Rongqi and Guizhou in Shunde, preparing for a second provocation. As for the Japanese army defeated in Heshan and Xinhui in recent days, about 2,000 to 3,000 were killed and wounded. The wounded were transported by Japanese warships from Beijie to Japanese military hospitals near Guangzhou for treatment, while the dead were cremated on the spot in Beijie. The newly arrived Japanese soldiers (mostly from Taiwan and Northeast China) were all moved by this situation, and most of them harbored war-weariness. This kind of thinking will greatly affect the future of the Japanese army's operations. (May 3)

### Japanese Planes Continue to Bomb Chaozhou and Shantou, Japanese Aircraft Carrier Anchored in Nanao, Shantou Heavily Damaged by Bombing, Japanese Planes Chase and Attack Fleeing Civilians

Shantou dispatch: From the 3rd of this month, the situation on the coast of Chaozhou and Shantou suddenly became tense. Garrison Commander Hua Zhenzhong, Shantou Mayor Wu Qi, and Police Chief Zhang Jiabin supervised the troops, guarding the coastal fortifications. On the one hand, they forced shops and factories to quickly move to the safe areas in the interior. On the morning of the 4th, the Japanese aircraft carrier Notoro anchored off Nanao, with another destroyer protecting it. Two cruisers, one being the Yubari, the flagship, anchored in the north and south ports of Chenghai County. Two destroyers anchored in Tuolin Bay, Raoping County. Two ships anchored outside Mayu Estuary in Shantou to Chaoyang Dahu. Regarding the Xiamen area, the Japanese army concentrated a division of troops, which could be transported to Chaozhou and Shantou at any time for combat. At 8 a.m. on the 4th, eight Japanese planes flew into the skies over Shantou City, dropping more than 20 bombs on Tongji Road, Zhijie, and Hengxiang. Shantou City opened fire, developing into an air-land battle. More than 40 civilian houses and warehouses were destroyed on Tongji Road, with dozens of people killed and wounded. Due to the collapse of houses, bodies have not been dug out, so the exact number is unknown. The Japanese planes then flew to Chao'an, wanting to take advantage of the spring tide to destroy the North Causeway, so that the water would flood the three counties. Fortunately, thanks to God's blessing, all five bombs fell at Yixi Station, damaging one truck and destroying multiple sections of the railway track. They then flew to Fengxi, dropping 11 bombs, destroying multiple sections of the railway track, with six people killed and wounded. The planes exited the sea through Jieyang. At 12 noon, eight more Japanese planes attacked Shantou for the second time, bombing at Niao Bridge, Tongji Bridge, and Guanghua Wharf. This area is a warehouse and factory district. More than 20 bombs were dropped at Guanghua Wharf. A match factory was destroyed. A garlic factory, a sauce and preserved plum factory, the Huainan Rice Industry Company's granary, and a salt factory were all destroyed, with 27 workers killed and many injured. Fifty houses collapsed. The planes then flew to the Chaozhou-Jieyang shipping dock, strafing the civilians gathered and waiting for boats to escape, lasting about an hour. More than 20 corpses were left on the dock. Everyone saw bullets raining down overhead, scrambling to escape, trampling and killing dozens of people. The Dayou and Dahua ships sailing from Shantou to Jieyang were caught up by Japanese planes midway. The Japanese planes then flew low and repeatedly bombed and strafed the defenseless refugees. The two ships rushed to the side of the houses, giving passengers time to escape. The Japanese planes dropped two bombs, both falling into the water. Passengers jumped into the water to escape, with heavy casualties, the number of which is unknown. The Jichang ship going to Donglong was also strafed by Japanese planes, killing four people and injuring ten on board on the spot. At 4 p.m., eight Japanese planes flew over again to scout various places. At this time, the city was filled with killing intent. The city and its suburbs were under military control, leaving only one escape route, allowing citizens to go to Sangpu Mountain in Chenghai. Citizens were eagerly seeking boats to Jiaoshi. The entire city has been evacuated. At night, there is not a single light. Those who remain in Shantou are all strong young men and volunteer teams, ready to engage in street fighting with the Japanese army at any time.

### Finances of Xikang Province After Establishment, Revenue Falls Short of Administrative and Construction Expenses, Relying Entirely on the Assistance of Sichuan Provincial Government and Central Government Subsidies

Kangding dispatch: Xikang is a newly established province, and is also one of the border provinces receiving financial assistance from the central government. The financial status of the province is briefly recorded below, past and present.

During the heyday of Xikang under the Qing Dynasty, border funds were provided by the national treasury, which was extremely substantial. During Zhao Erfeng's era of border management, there were special expenses, with more than 4 million taels per year coming from household registration and allocations from Sichuan Province. There are still records to be found. Therefore, the army was paid double, giving them high salaries. Grain and cash were transported continuously. Even before the eighth year of the Republic [1919], Sichuan Province's aid money was more than one million taels per year. During the Republic period, Liu Wenhui was appointed to defend the border, fitting the caution of the battered border situation. At that time, because he also presided over Sichuan's administration, he decided to use the principle of Sichuan helping Xikang, transferring the income of Hongya and Mingshan counties to subsidize. Since the autumn of the 22nd year [1933], the special funds for border aid have stopped being allocated, and the tax revenue of each county has been returned to Sichuan Province. It relied solely on the taxes from more than ten desolate and poor counties in Xikang, and revenue was poured in. Therefore, Xikang's military and political expenses were extremely difficult at that time. The soldiers guarding the border relied only on miscellaneous grains and zanba to barely maintain their lives. All new undertakings were limited by funding and could not be carried out. In July of the 24th year [1935], the Xikang Provincial Establishment Committee was established in Ya'an, with a monthly subsidy of 10,000 yuan from the central government. The amount not covered still relied on military funding. Before long, the military funds of the 24th Army were allocated by the Sichuan-Xikang Pacification Commissioner's Office in a unified manner. At the same time, the monthly subsidy for the Establishment Committee was also increased to 15,000 yuan. In the 25th year [1936], the Establishment Committee moved to Kangding, and military and political affairs were clearly divided, with unified accounting for revenue and expenditure, and the local taxation was reorganized, the local tax bureau was reorganized, the financial and currency system was adjusted, and budgets and final accounts were strictly enforced, which was quite effective. Although Xikang's finances were on track at that time, the total income of Xikang was ultimately limited, and there was no financial support for the matters that needed to be addressed. Although the financial system was determined, the financial difficulties themselves could not be resolved. This is the general situation of Xikang's past finances (to be continued)

### Jiangsu Provincial Education Director Ma Yuanfang Talks About the Overall Picture of Education in Jiangsu Province After the War (Part 2), Changes in Educational Administrative Institutions in the Province and Counties, and Overview of the Work of Implementing War of Resistance Education

Changes in County Educational Administrative Institutions

(2) Changes in county educational administrative institutions: Before the 26th year [1937], the education bureaus in various counties of the province were divided into five grades based on the amount of education funds. The internal organization was divided into three sections: general affairs, school education, and social education. In the first semester of the 27th year [1938], the Provincial Education Department formulated the "Measures for the Merger of Departments in Education Bureaus of Various Counties in Jiangsu Province," stipulating that if the actual amount of education funds received in each county is more than 80,000 yuan and most of the education undertakings in the county can be maintained as before, the education bureau can continue to exist, merging the internal affairs of the bureau and reducing the number of positions to implement administrative expenses. The internal affairs of the bureau are divided between the general affairs and education sections. If the education funds in each county are less than 80,000 yuan and most of the education undertakings are suspended, the original bureaus will be temporarily merged into the first section of the county government. As for the educational administrative organizations in the occupied areas, they have been completely destroyed. In the second half of the 27th year [1938], the Provincial Education Department specially re-established the educational administrative organizations in the occupied counties in order to restore the educational undertakings in the occupied areas. In view of the reality of inspecting, assessing, guiding, and supervising education in the area, county supervisors were established in each county (education bureaus or sections may still be established when necessary), working in the county government and handling educational matters throughout the county under the leadership of the county head. Educational committees are not established separately in each school district below the county level, and the district heads of each autonomous region are responsible for planning, promoting, and supervising education. If there are county primary schools already established in the district, the county government may order the principals to concurrently serve as educational committee members, taking on the responsibility of educational guidance in the district.

Various Measures in Educational Administration

(3) Measures in educational administration: In recent years, the important measures in educational administration in Jiangsu Province are approximately as follows: (1) Formulating the "Emergency Measures for Wartime Education in Jiangsu Province" and the "Wartime Custody Measures for Various Educational Institutions in Jiangsu Province," When Jiangsu Province became a war zone, planned measures should be taken in advance for educational institutions at all levels. Therefore, these two measures were formulated to give appropriate treatment to all educational undertakings. All provincial educational institutions in the province that have entered a state of suspension are uniformly sending personnel to take custody. (2) Holding graduation joint examinations: In August of the 27th year [1938], high schools, junior high schools, normal schools, and rural normal schools graduation joint examinations were held in separate districts. High school and junior high school graduation joint examinations were held in four districts: Lianshui, Siyang, Dongtai, and Xinghua. Normal school graduation joint examinations were held in three districts: Huaiyin, Taixian, and Muyang. Rural normal school graduation joint examinations were held in the Huaian district. (3) Formulating grade-level examination measures: formulating grade-level examination measures for county middle schools and private junior high schools in each county of the province to accommodate junior high school students from various secondary schools that were suspended during the war, and grade-level examination measures for various temporary middle schools to adjust the grades of junior high schools, senior high schools, normal schools, and rural normal schools. (4) Registering secondary school teachers and staff: Registering the teachers and staff of each secondary school, and introducing them to each school in the province and county separately to provide relief. (5) Sending personnel to supervise provincial and county educational institutions, strictly assessing their work performance, and promoting the education undertakings in the province and counties.

Intensifying the Implementation of Wartime Curriculum

In order to promote education for resistance and national construction, the provincial government has repeatedly ordered all primary and secondary schools in the province to intensify the implementation of the wartime curriculum. Regarding secondary schools, the outline of the national secondary school curriculum, the outline of special education for secondary schools, and other wartime secondary education laws and regulations promulgated by the ministry have been distributed to various schools for reference and implementation. Regarding primary schools, various wartime primary education laws and regulations, such as the outline of special education for primary schools promulgated by the ministry, have also been distributed to various primary schools for compliance. In addition, the Department issued the "Measures for Training Primary School Students in Five Subjects During the Anti-Japanese Period" and "Measures for Implementing Special Wartime Education in Primary and Secondary Schools in Various Counties," which were circulated to various primary and secondary schools for reference and implementation. Collecting teaching materials for resistance and national construction: All provincial secondary schools were ordered to organize subject teaching material research societies to collect teaching materials related to resistance and national construction, and report them to the Education Department for review and distribution to various schools for adoption.

### Yesterday's May 9th National Humiliation: All Circles Mournfully Commemorate: Support National Policy, Persist to the End, to Achieve the Purpose of Atoning for Humiliation and Revitalization

Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the May 9th National Humiliation. All circles in the city fasted for a day and stopped entertainment banquets to mournfully commemorate it. All circles supported the national policy and persisted to the end to achieve the purpose of atoning for humiliation and revitalization. In previous years, all circles flew flags at half-mast on this day for commemoration. However, this year, due to environmental difficulties, after joint consultation by various groups, it was decided not to fly flags temporarily. Relevant groups set off in different directions the day before to explain, but yesterday many shops on various roads still voluntarily flew flags at half-mast, which shows the citizens' deep commemoration of the May 9th National Humiliation.

### Dispute Over Voluntary Flag-Raising

Yesterday, those who voluntarily raised flags included shops on Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, Zhizhi Road, Shili Road, and Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession, but they were persuaded to remove them by the patrol authorities. Until around 10:00 AM, Shunfa Shoe Store at Touji Bridge was persuaded to remove the flag hanging on the window by the Western patrol officer dispatched at the time, but soon the store re-hung the national flag on a high building, and the Western patrol officer went to persuade them again. The store then removed the flag again, and after the Western patrol officer left, they re-hung the national flag on the roof. Because they did not listen to the persuasion, the Western patrol officer arrested an employee of the store and took him to the patrol station. After questioning, he was released immediately. However, the Shunfa Shoe Store employee who was arrested by the patrol station was even more outraged, and when he returned to the store, he told people about the incident at the Rishenglou and other places, which caused listeners to gather, and passers-by such as Qi Dunbao also echoed the same. The Wang Cui and tin foil shops in the area then closed their doors one after another. Before long, large and small shops on the road closed their doors voluntarily, causing a rather serious situation for a time. The patrol authorities at the time also received the news and dispatched police cars and police officers to defend and maintain order. The road people gathered more and more, and the situation was very tense, causing traffic to be stopped. However, after persuasion by the authorities, it returned to its original state, and a small dispute ended.

As of midnight last night, it was learned that twenty-two people had been detained in the Laozha Patrol Station due to flag-raising disputes, and twenty-five national flags were still detained in the patrol station and had not been returned. Negotiations are underway.

### Rice and Grain Evaluation Meeting: Measures to Stabilize the Rice Market: Registration of Rice Storing Owners, Limited Price Sale, Many Sold in the Market Yesterday Morning, Situation Relaxed

The Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee held a meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss rice prices and crack down on speculation, and decided to set a price limit for rice and grain and plan to purchase foreign rice. Yesterday, the Shantou gang in the market accepted the advice and sold the No. 1 white rice, and the various gang Xian rice came out one after another, so the rice price stabilized accordingly. Details are recorded as follows:

Meeting Again to Stabilize Rice Prices

In order to stabilize rice prices and crack down on speculation, the Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee held its third committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on the fourth floor of the Silk Industry Building on Hankou Road. Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao, Zhou Zhizhen, Pan Jibin, Huang Ruyuan, Shi Zufeng, Zhu Zhaoqi, Fu Qiankeng, Zhu Zixiang, Chen Ziyi, Shi Hongdong, and Yan Jiyun attended. Chen Ziyi was elected as the temporary chairman, and he first reported the purpose of the meeting and the amount of rice exceeding the price limit in the rice market.

Resolution: Price Limit

The discussion then began on the price limit case. It was decided that rice market transactions must comply with the price limit stipulated in the joint meeting of rice industry groups on the 5th of this month. If there is any exceeding the limit, the Market Management Committee should strictly implement it in accordance with the rules. Regarding the registration of rice storing owners, it was decided to formulate a form and issue a public announcement, publish it in the market, and notify various rice industry groups to inform their colleagues that all rice storing owners must fill out the form and register at the Rice Industry Association within the specified time limit for verification, otherwise it should be reported to the Concession for day-to-day processing. Regarding the proposal to invite a third party to participate in this committee, it was decided to send a letter to the two Concession authorities and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to send personnel to participate for reference. Regarding the proposal to request the two Concession authorities to purchase rice and grain, it was decided to send a letter with specific suggestions to try to purchase rice and grain from various places for storage, in order to stabilize market prices.

Planning Ahead to Purchase Foreign Rice

The New Voice News reporter inquired about the rice industry leaders yesterday. According to reports, the city has more than 560,000 bags of grain reserves, and the rice shops have more than 300,000 bags, totaling about 800,000 bags of grain reserves in the city. Although there are continuous shipments from various producing areas, about 20,000 to 30,000 bags per day, the rice industry groups in the city have discussed once in case of need, and decided to obtain the consent of the two Concession authorities to order a huge amount of foreign rice to be transported to Shanghai for relief in order to maintain the people's food. Moreover, the current price limit is equal to the selling price of foreign rice, and there will be no difficulties at that time. This issue is currently being studied separately by various rice industry groups, and the opinions will be compiled and reported to the Concession authorities and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for joint discussion.

People's Hearts Are Stable, Comply with Measures

Currently, because the rice market exceeds the price limit, large households have been hoarding, which once caused a chaotic state. Although the Rice Market Committee has repeatedly advised, it is still sold, and the major households are still observing their attitude. All the citizens of the city are worried about this, and they are buying and hiding from the rice shops to prevent accidents, so most of the smaller rice shops have sold out. Although the employees of the rice shops have tried their best to advise them not to scare each other, it is ineffective. Because the rice market has stabilized and the major households have sold, the people's hearts have become stable, and it is heard that the rice shop industry has decided to abide by the agreed measures, and the various committees will supervise the shop owners to do their best to deal with the current environment in order to maintain the overall situation, and not just focus on personal interests.

Hoarders Sell, Market Stabilizes

After the Bean Rice Market Management Committee has tried its best to advise the various firms and merchants to take care of the overall situation and not to speculate, yesterday morning in the market, the Shantou gang, including Tong Anxiangji, sold 3,000 bags of the No. 1 Changshu white rice that they had purchased and prepared to ship to Shantou in the market to maintain rice prices. However, it was stipulated that each buyer should not exceed 20 bags at most, and the market committee distributed them to the rice shops for the market, with a price of 15 yuan and a commission added separately. As for the Xian rice, a huge amount was also sold. Therefore, the market price has stabilized.

Japanese Merchants Handle Rice, Aiming to Profit

The Japanese side attempted to control the rice in its occupied areas, but because the rice-producing towns are controlled by guerrillas, this control plan is difficult to achieve. However, the national rice transported from the producing areas to Shanghai, in addition to paying exorbitant taxes, also often encounters obstacles. In addition, such as Yanhu's suspension of issuing rice and grain, and Changshu and Wuxi's restrictions on the sale of national rice. The Shanghai Maritime Company went to the producing areas to purchase in large quantities and transported them to Guangzhou, North China, and other places for sale.

Report the Process and Dredge Sources

Fu Qiankeng, the chairman of the Bean Rice Market Management Committee, will report the process of the third evaluation committee meeting to the various gang merchants and peddlers this morning, and advise them to try their best to dredge sources and purchase as much as possible to avoid panic among the Shanghai citizens. As for the evaluation committee, it plans to issue a notice today to inform all rice storing shop owners to register all village rice with the Bean Rice Industry Association from today, and will send letters to the two Concessions.

### Japanese Representatives and Police Authorities Discuss Banning Anti-Japanese Publications

The China Press reported that representatives of the Japanese Army, Navy, and Consulate General held a discussion with the police authorities of the Public Concession yesterday (the 8th) morning regarding the Public Concession's system of Chinese groups, the wisdom and affection of Chongqing, anti-Japanese journalists, and publications. The two-hour discussion aimed to ban anti-Japanese groups and publications, and arrest anti-Japanese journalists. Those who participated in the meeting included Colonel Kanetani, the commander of the Japanese Military Police, Lieutenant Commander Mitsunobu, the director of the Navy's reporting department, Saka, the police chief of the Japanese Consulate, Bowen, the chief of the Public Concession Police Department, and Robertson, the chief of the Special Political Section of the Police Department. On May 6, the Police Department issued an order to all Chinese newspapers to submit all announcements and other documents related to the authorities for inspection before publication.

### Japanese Demands on the Public Works Department: Britain Cannot Agree: Even if Oppressed, Britain Will Assist in Resisting: The Issue of Returning the Northern District Will Be Discussed and Negotiated

British Parliamentarians Express Urgent Concern: Reuters, 8th. A meeting was held in the British House of Commons recently. Conservative Party member Milner raised the issue of the Japanese demands on the Shanghai Public Works Department, saying that before a joint meeting is held between the treaty countries and China, discussions on changing the bureau or the land charter should not be tolerated. Conservative Party member Morell also said that when the Japanese army occupied the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas, Britain should refuse to consider any changes, and the British should not be able to legally enjoy property in the above areas. Foreign Minister Butler replied to the above two questions together, saying that Foreign Minister Halifax has not received the full text of the Japanese declaration on greatly changing the status quo of the Public Concession, including the Shanghai Public Works Department. It is stable that the Japanese side has sent the same note to the British Ambassador in Tokyo and the Shanghai Public Works Department. The organization of the Shanghai Public Works Department is determined by the Land Charter, and any changes to the Charter will not take legal effect without the permission of the Chinese government. The British government cannot agree to this change until it has fully considered it with all other relevant parties. Milner asked again whether Britain would assist the bureau to resist the Japanese proposal if the Japanese side pressured the bureau to change its organization so that it would be under Japanese control. Butler replied, yes. The China Press reported that rumors that the Public Works Department and the Japanese authorities had agreed on the return of the area north of the Suzhou River to the full management of the Public Works Department yesterday (the 8th) were denied by a senior official of the Public Works Department. It is said that negotiations are still underway, but the trial has been going on for more than a year, and its final settlement has been delayed several times due to various demands from the Japanese side. One of the demands is to add Japanese people to high-ranking positions in the Hongkou Police Department, because the Japanese side claims that it holds sovereignty in the area. Although he expects that this problem cannot be solved soon, it seems that the negotiations have reached a decision stage last week. When reporters asked about the restoration of tram and bus services in the Northern and Eastern Districts, the official replied that the British Consulate had handled the matter and exerted pressure to start the business as soon as possible. He replied to another question that unless the Shanghai Consular Corps approves and instructs the Public Works Department to respond to the requirements of "Mayor" Chuan Xiaoquan, the Public Works Department will not do so.

### Reduced Number of Japanese Warships in Hangzhou Bay; Foreign Vessels Successively Sail to Wenzhou; More Than Ten Japanese Warships Still Have Not Departed; Chinese Coastal Troops Maintain Vigilance Without Relaxation

According to sources in Zhejiang Province, ever since Japanese warships and aircraft repeatedly harassed the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang and concentrated a large number of warships in Hangzhou Bay, seemingly preparing to invade eastern Zhejiang, the situation had become tense. Recently, news received by the shipping industry indicated that although Japanese warships were frequently moving in the waters off Zhejiang, there were no unusual activities. However, Japanese aircraft continued to fly reconnaissance missions. A portion of the warships anchored in Hangzhou Bay had departed, leaving approximately ten warships currently anchored. The situation in eastern Zhejiang seemed to have eased slightly. However, Chinese coastal troops remained vigilant and had not relaxed their defenses.

Untrue Report of Moufu Being Detained in Wenzhou; The German vessel Moufu, belonging to the German firm Reith & Co., departed from Shanghai yesterday morning at 5:00 AM, heading directly to Wenzhou. As this was the first voyage after the opening of the Zhenjiang River, the amount of passengers and cargo being carried was not particularly crowded. Around 6:00 PM, rumors suddenly spread in the shipping industry that the vessel had been detained for tax reasons. A reporter from Da Guang News Agency inquired with the company authorities that evening and confirmed that the rumors were completely untrue. If any accident had occurred during the voyage, a telegram would have been sent to Shanghai. Since the company had not received any telegram, it was presumed that the voyage was proceeding smoothly.

Dingfang Telegraph Informs of Delayed Departure of Hana; The German vessel Hana, belonging to the German firm Far East Shipping Company, had successfully resumed its Shanghai-Dinghai route on the 3rd of this month. The second voyage was originally scheduled to depart Shanghai for Dinghai at 4:30 PM yesterday. All cargo had been cleared by customs and loaded on the 8th, and passengers had also boarded. However, when the vessel was about to set sail, the company suddenly received a telegram from Dinghai stating "departure delayed." Upon inquiring with the company authorities, it was reported that the military authorities in eastern Zhejiang had not yet completed the navigation procedures, resulting in the delay. However, it was expected to be resolved within the next few days. Currently, the vessel has refunded passenger tickets, but the cargo has not been unloaded.

Feikang and Dengsan Vessels Both Commence Operations; The British vessel Lisheng, belonging to Jardine Matheson & Co., arrived in Shanghai from Minwan, Wenzhou, the day before yesterday and departed Shanghai for Fuzhou yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, also stopping at Wan and Wenzhou, carrying passengers and cargo. The German vessel Feikang, belonging to Luhlin & Co., is scheduled to resume its Shanghai-Wenzhou route for the first time today at 4:00 PM. The German vessel Haifu, belonging to Reith & Co., is scheduled to sail to Wenzhou tomorrow.

Nanning Sails to Shanghai, Ender Delayed in Ou; The British vessel Nanning, belonging to Butterfield & Swire Co., on the Shanghai-Hong Kong route, is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow after departing from Freeport Bay and Wenzhou. The Italian vessel Ender, belonging to the Italian China Company, was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai last night. However, according to a report from the company authorities at 8:00 PM last night, the vessel is currently stranded in Wenzhou. Therefore, the date of its return to Shanghai is difficult to determine.

Libao Telegraphs Arrival This Morning; It is also learned that the Italian vessel Libao sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the morning of the 8th, which was previously unknown. In addition to the cargo loaded on the previous voyage from Wenzhou, the vessel did not carry any passengers. The vessel's company received a telegram from the vessel yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, stating that it had reached the Mopan waters at 3:00 PM and would reach the Wuli waters at 8:00 PM, anchoring overnight and entering the port the following morning.

German Vessels Expected to Regain Freedom Soon; According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Japanese warships have detained German, Italian, Portuguese, and Norwegian merchant ships in the Fujian and Zhejiang waters, totaling 25 vessels. Among them, Portuguese merchant ships are the most numerous. After repeated negotiations by the Portuguese Consul, the passengers and cargo were unloaded first, but the vessels remained under surveillance. The Portuguese Consul is currently continuing negotiations. It is now learned that the German and Italian ships detained include the Tianbao, Gaodeng, Liwuduo, Weijinde, and other five vessels. As a result of continuous negotiations by the German and Italian Consuls-General in Shanghai in recent days, the Liwuduo has already been released. Yesterday, rumors circulated in the shipping industry that the Gaodeng, Tianbao, Weijinde, and other four vessels would be released soon. Whether this is true remains to be investigated.

### The Mazuishi Giant Vessel's Maiden Voyage from the United States to Shanghai; Arriving This Afternoon; Departing for the Philippines Tomorrow

The first giant vessel, "Rulammusk", of Mazuishi, which is the first in the industry, has completed its voyage between the Pacific and New York in the United States, and will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. When the vessel docks at the Gonghexing Wharf, it will be around 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM. The vessel will only stay for one day and is scheduled to depart tomorrow (the 11th) afternoon after taking on passengers, heading to the Philippines and then to New York, USA, arriving on July 14th. This new vessel is the first giant vessel newly ordered by Mazuishi Shipping, with a deadweight of 9,200 tons and a length exceeding any other ship, at 482 feet.

### Bombing of Foreign Property; Japanese Side Quibbles and Evades; Claims It Is Difficult to Distinguish Markings at Aircraft Altitude; Did Not Make Foreign Property a Main Target for Bombing

According to the North-China Daily News, when the Japanese side hosted reporters yesterday (the 8th), one reporter asked, "Under what circumstances would the Japanese authorities be willing to take responsibility for bombing foreign property, as Chongqing has recently been bombed?" The Navy spokesman replied, "If it is a mistake or accidental bombing, the Japanese military is willing to take responsibility." The reporter then asked, "Are the Japanese authorities willing to take responsibility for intentional bombing?" The spokesman replied, "The Japanese Army and Navy never intentionally bomb foreign property."

The Japanese side is investigating incidents of bombing foreign property and has found no evidence of intentional bombing. Someone asked, "Apart from the Panay incident and other similar unfortunate incidents, are there any other cases where foreign property has been bombed and the Japanese side has been willing to take responsibility?" The spokesman replied, "As far as I remember, there have been no such incidents recently. There have been several times when foreign property has been bombed, and those who claimed it was intentional have been identified by the pilots who participated in the bombing. These differences of opinion have been resolved through diplomatic negotiations." Someone asked whether the Japanese side, in these negotiations, always held the position that the pilots could not have made a mistake. The spokesman replied that the Japanese side investigated all complaints received from those bombed and responded to the relevant consuls. It was difficult to distinguish foreign markings from the altitude at which bombs were dropped, and it was almost impossible to distinguish them during vertical flight. The maps provided by the various foreign consulates were copied and distributed to all bombing personnel. They carefully reviewed these maps before bombing, which clearly showed the locations of the various foreign properties. However, the Chinese anti-aircraft gun teams located near these foreign buildings were not marked on the map. When attacking anti-aircraft gun positions, unfortunate incidents may occur due to the close proximity. One reporter said that he had collected previous statements from the Japanese side and got the impression that the Japanese side did not actually admit responsibility for bombing foreign property. He also asked, based on his impression, whether Chinese artillery teams were usually located one or two miles away from foreign property, so that the destruction of foreign property could not be blamed on the proximity of the artillery teams. The spokesman replied that if the Chinese anti-aircraft gun teams were far away from foreign property, there would be no excuse, but he did not think the gun teams would be that far away. He also said that Japanese aircraft flying over Chongqing did not disperse their formations.

A reporter then asked how this could be reconciled with the claim that a detachment of Japanese aircraft attacked Chinese artillery teams. The spokesman replied that each detachment maintained its own formation and generally did not disperse. Japanese aircraft did not make the areas of Chongqing where foreign property was hit a main target for bombing. The spokesman then quoted a passage from the Japanese translation of international law, saying that it could not be considered that Chongqing was exempt from bombing.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Works Department; Maintaining Good Road Administration; Dividing the Settlement into Two Districts for Specialized Management; Important Roads Are Repaved with Sanhe Soil; Work Does Not Stop Due to Traffic Congestion or Expensive Materials

According to the North-China Daily News, since the outbreak of the war, the situation in the Public Settlement has been abnormal, with the increase in vehicles and the high cost of building materials being the difficulties currently faced by the Roads Section of the Municipal Council Works Department. The congestion of traffic necessitates major repairs to the Public Settlement and the roads outside the settlement. The condition of some roads in the Western District is very poor, and it is sometimes difficult to repair them. Even when construction can begin, it is often delayed due to a shortage of materials.

Although Materials Are Expensive

the Works Department is still able to carry out its work and do its best to remedy the situation. To manage and inspect the roads, the Public Settlement is divided into two districts. One is west of Yu Qiaqing Road, including the Western District, managed by two engineers. The area east and north of Yu Qiaqing Road is included in the Eastern District, with regular inspectors constantly patrolling. If there is any damage to the road surface, it is immediately reported to the engineer for investigation and estimation of

Repair Costs

The report is submitted to the Works Department General Inspector. Once approved, repairs begin immediately. The west side of Yu Qiaqing Road, from Nanjing Road to the Racecourse, has already been rebuilt. Currently, Avenue Edward VII and Connaught Road are being repaired. Fuzhou Road and Beijing Road have a lot of damage, and a portion of them is being rebuilt. The Daxi Road between Yidingpan Road and Dunxin Road has also been rebuilt into a 30-foot-wide Sanhe soil road surface, to be able to handle

Double-Layered Automobiles

The east side of Yu Qiaqing Road south of the Xizang Road Bridge has been severely damaged by handcarts and is now being rebuilt. Other roads that will be started soon include several sections of Weihaiwei Road, such as the bend east of Seymour Road, which will be widened to 40 feet. The area near Chongqing Road will be widened by 18 feet, and the area near Mu'erwu Road will be widened by 11 feet. These will all be

Paved With Sanhe Soil

Road surface. Since traffic on these roads will not decrease, the old asphalt road surface will be removed and replaced with Sanhe soil. Therefore, most of the roads in the Public Settlement will eventually be paved with Sanhe soil. The damage to the roads in the Public Settlement is mostly caused by iron-wheeled handcarts, and the damage is particularly severe in the summer. When a handcart stops, its iron wheels sink into the road surface.

Leaving A Mark

As subsequent handcarts drive over it, it gradually deepens and soon needs to be repaired. It is mainly heavy trucks. The asphalt on the roads in the residential area is only for light traffic. In the past, food was transported by mountain boats, but now it is transported by roads in the Western District, resulting in the need for major repairs and the replacement of asphalt road surfaces with Sanhe soil. Therefore, old-fashioned handcarts and "new-style" heavy trucks seem to be the main difficulties in maintaining the roads of the Public Settlement in good condition.

Safety Movement Games; Opening Soon

The Committee for Promoting Safety in Walking, initiated by the Municipal Council, has been preparing in groups since deciding to hold a propaganda week from June 3rd to 9th. The committee has now printed various slogans and booklets and is conducting propaganda separately. Posters are being put up on utility poles, urging people not to walk on the roads and to follow the instructions of the police. Simple and important road regulations booklets are being issued to bicycle licensees. Warnings are being posted in automobile shops, reminding drivers to strictly observe traffic rules. At the same time, people are being sent to schools, teahouses, factories, and refugee camps to give lectures on the importance of safety in walking, in order to reduce the number of unfortunate accidents.

### North-China Daily News; Receives Threatening Letter; Claims to Be from the "Patriotic National Salvation Corps"; Demands a Change in Editorial Policy

According to the North-China Daily News, the North-China Daily News received a letter claiming to be from the "Chinese Youth Patriotic National Salvation Corps," which stated, "If you do not correct your past mistakes, you will be considered traitors. In addition to being executed, your entire family will be exterminated." This is obviously one of the letters sent to the Chinese-language newspapers of various foreign firms in Shanghai, demanding that they change their anti-Japanese attitude. Similar letters have been sent to these newspapers before. The North-China Daily News is

Not A Chinese Newspaper

but it is included by these young people among the newspapers to be executed. The letter stated that two previous letters had been sent to the newspaper, demanding that they change their editorial policy. However, it

Expressed Regret

that the newspapers had ignored their letters. Therefore, the corps, with several thousand members, decided to make this "final" appeal. In the future, they must not publish political commentary, or the corps would implement its "legal judgment." The letter also stated, "Once your entire family's population, activities, and addresses have been investigated clearly, if you do not correct your past mistakes, you will be considered traitors. In addition to being executed, your entire family will be exterminated." The last phrase is

An Ancient Chinese Saying, referring not only to beheading, but also to confiscating property. It also stated, "You are all Chinese, and you cannot use the name of a foreign firm to insult your personality. We hope you will quickly change your ways. If you want to seek your own death, the time will come." The letter was sent on Sunday, but only the China Press and the North-China Daily News had received it by yesterday (the 8th) afternoon.

### Visit to Lin Kanghou

— Zhou

His heart for promoting education and saving the country came from the Reform Movement, but what he learned was naturally (Confucius said) (The Book of Songs says). So he gladly went to Japan to study education. After returning, he served as a teacher at Longmen Normal School, but he still believed that primary school was the foundation of national education. To change the law, it was necessary to popularize national education and run primary schools. He saw that the only driving force behind the wealth and strength of Germany and Japan was the popularization of national education. For this reason, he both advocated his ideas and presided over the affiliated primary school of Nanyang Public School (now Jiaotong University) in Xujiahui, implementing his ideas.

During the Qing Guangxu period, the national movement to redeem roads was in full swing, and private railways were springing up. Although the Sichuan-Han and Guangdong-Han railways had not been built despite fundraising, the Su and Zhejiang railways (now the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway) were built one after another. At that time, the authorities of the Su Railway decided not to use foreigners as the chief of traffic affairs, but they could not find suitable talent after searching everywhere. Someone thought of Mr. Lin.

The authorities sent someone to invite him to fill the position of chief of military affairs of the Su Railway. After he knew their intention, he said with a smile, "It is a joke to ask a cooper to build a house, and it is even more ridiculous to ask a teacher to manage the military. I am determined to run primary school education and hope to be engaged in education for the rest of my life."

After several rounds of persuasion by the people who came to invite him, Mr. Lin, who was full of sympathy, could not resist their persuasive words. He practiced the principle of being loyal to others and trustworthy to friends that Zeng Zi admired. He decided to work hard and do the job of chief of traffic affairs as a teacher. Before long, the Su and Zhejiang railways were nationalized and renamed the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. Mr. Lin retired from the position of chief of traffic affairs.

When the Xinhua Savings Bank of Peiping was established, the authorities remembered that Mr. Lin was a hardworking and industrious person and "could learn and apply immediately and learn more when he felt insufficient." This increased their determination to urge Mr. Lin to go to work there. When he arrived at Xinhua Bank, he was just like an old banker. The Xinhua Bank authorities believed that Shanghai was the economic center of China, so they asked him to take up the post of manager of the Shanghai branch. Later, the Shanghai branch of Xinhua Bank was very trusted by the society, thanks to the efforts of Mr. Lin.

In the spring of the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the Revolutionary Army approached Shanghai, and the Shanghai Political Council set up a committee to reorganize the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Mr. Lin was also appointed as a member of the committee and was elected as one of the chairman members. During the reorganization, he made many plans for reorganizing the affairs of the Chamber of Commerce. However, due to his responsibility of serving the community and the burden of military affairs, he resigned from his bank position.

The Shanghai Banking Association believed that Mr. Lin was familiar with banking business, treated people kindly, and knew that Mr. Lin often compared himself to a person stringing money, saying that people are all pearls, some big, some small, some bright, some dim. If they are placed randomly in a plate, they will not look beautiful. If they are arranged neatly and strung with a thread, each one will be lovable and appropriate. If there is a suitable connection in spirit between people, it can show love and sincerity. Without grievances, they will naturally cooperate fully. Therefore, they invited Mr. Lin to serve as the secretary-general of the association.

In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai First Special District Municipal Council added Chinese directors and committee members. Mr. Lin served as the education and works committee member. Later, he believed that education was even more important, so he specialized in education. He concurrently served as chairman, director, or supervisor of many industrial and commercial companies, and also participated in many partnerships, mostly to help others.

During the "January 28th" incident in the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Sun Zhesheng was the head of the Executive Yuan, and he served as the permanent director of the Ministry of Finance, and then as the political director. Although the time was only one month, he had a glimpse of the overall picture of what should be promoted and reformed in the financial field. However, Mr. Lin believed that being an official was not for enjoying life, but for suffering. He still maintained his lifelong interest and politely told those who sought positions, "I cannot harm you." In the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Lin was elected as the head of the Siamese inspection group and led dozens of members to Siam. Siam is a tropical place, and Mr. Lin worked tirelessly, doing his best to comfort the overseas Chinese and promote diplomatic relations. This has resulted in great gains in Sino-Siamese relations. Even today, the overseas Chinese in Siam still have a deep impression of Mr. Lin, a kind and amiable gentleman.

Last year, he was also elected as the Chinese employer representative at the 24th International Labour Conference and the Chinese representative at the 16th World Red Cross Conference. After being appointed by the National Government, he went abroad without hesitation. After the closing of the two conferences, he traveled briefly in Europe and the United States for six months, traveling 200,000 li and visiting dozens of countries, writing 100,000 words of notes. When he returned to China, his spirit was even more full than when he went abroad.

After a long conversation, because people who urged him to attend the meeting came to invite him frequently, I thanked Mr. Lin and said goodbye. (End)

### Stranded on Huote Island; Watching a Japanese Ship Sinking After Being Hit by Waves; Fifty to Sixty Crew Members All Rescued; The Ship That Sank Has Already Been Split in Two

According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the 5,374-ton Japanese mail steamship Marika Maru, after running aground in heavy fog last Friday night off Huote Island (transliteration), 130 miles from Shanghai, was broken by huge waves and sank to the bottom of the sea, completely lost. The first to respond to the ship's distress call was the Preto (transliteration), captained by Edgar. The steamer sailed to the

Dangerous Location

At 10:30 AM on May 6, the broken ship was spotted. The captain stopped nearby to prepare to assist the crew of the Marika Maru. They seemed to have abandoned their ship and were sailing towards the Preto in lifeboats. Suddenly, two Japanese destroyers, Nos. 1 and 4, arrived at the scene. Captain Edgar then handed over the rescue work to the Japanese ships and sailed

Ahead

At that time, the Marika Maru was still stranded on the island, but it was undoubtedly about to sink after being hit by huge waves. Personnel from the Japanese Mail Steamship Company here received the news and chartered the tugboat Caroline Moller to sail to the scene of the accident in an attempt to carry out rescue work. When the Moller arrived at the island, the Marika Maru was still

Stranded On The Shore

with heavy damage, but the two Japanese destroyers were nowhere to be seen. All the crew members of the Marika Maru had returned to their ship. When they saw the Moller arriving, they abandoned the ship again and boarded the lifeboats, approaching the Moller. The group of fifty to sixty people then boarded the tugboat and escaped. While this rescue tugboat was berthed nearby, the Marika Maru split in two and gradually sank as everyone watched.

Wartime Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Losses and Wartime Accounting Settlement Methods; Mr. Xu Guanqun Argues That Each Industry Should Decide For Itself; Mr. Bei Zuyi Believes That This Is Not A Legal Issue

Since Accountant Xi Yushu petitioned the Ministry of Economic Affairs to list wartime losses of industrial and commercial enterprises as deferred assets, the Ministry approved the request, which has attracted close attention from the industrial and commercial sectors. Subsequently, according to the opinion of Accountant Pan Xulun, this wartime loss is purely a loss of consumption and has no asset effect. It should be deducted from the capital item to avoid falsely calculating profits and overestimating assets. Moreover, listing it as an asset would violate company regulations. As a result, opinions vary and there is no consensus. The settlement of industrial and commercial enterprises has no fixed rules. The opinions of Mr. Xu Guanqun and Mr. Bei Zuyi are recorded below.

Mr. Xu's Opinion

Countless industrial and commercial enterprises have suffered huge losses. Accountant Xi filed a petition to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to list these losses as deferred assets in order to protect China's industrial and commercial enterprises. His intention is very commendable. The Ministry subsequently approved the petition and agreed to amortize it over ten years. If wartime losses are listed as deferred assets in the annual settlement, it seems to be well-founded. Moreover, since it can be amortized over the years, it is an asset. Accountant Pan's arguments are based on accounting principles and current company law, which are also accurate. In short, there should be extraordinary measures in extraordinary times. I believe that since Accountant Xi has the Ministry's approval, the industrial and commercial settlement can be used as the criterion in extraordinary times, which should be in line with the regulations. Accountant Pan's arguments are all based on legal principles, and the industrial and commercial settlement can also be based on this. In fact, there are settlements in various industries that go beyond the above two approaches. Take the pharmaceutical factory that I run as an example. It deals with wartime losses by setting up a separate reserve item. Because the characteristics of each industry are different, the results of the settlement are also different. The method of dealing with it is extremely difficult to unify. If the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Finance, in order to sympathize with the difficulties of businessmen, allow each industry to decide on its settlement according to its convenience, the industrial revival will be greatly relied upon.

Mr. Bei's Opinion

There are three ways to deal with special losses in accounting: (1) to be borne by the income of the current period; (2) to be borne by the income of future periods; and (3) to be directly deducted from the capital. Since wartime losses cannot be borne by the income of the current period, and it is not convenient to directly deduct them from the capital, it may be advisable to temporarily list them as assets so that they can be amortized on a regular basis. Listing wartime losses as deferred assets is an accounting treatment issue, not a legal issue. If a company's wartime losses have exceeded one-third of its total capital, or its property is obviously insufficient to cover its debts, the directors and supervisors can convene a shareholders' meeting to discuss countermeasures or apply to the court to declare bankruptcy. However, even if a company suffers huge losses, if its earning capacity is still good and its surplus is not only enough to compensate for the losses but also has a surplus, it would be unwise to force it to end its business from the perspective of the national economy and government tax revenue. From the perspective of creditors, they are also unwilling to force the enterprise to end its business to avoid the risk of "dying with you." Therefore, the survival of the enterprise must be maintained within the possible scope.

### Tai Dequan Conspires with Accomplices to Extort Money from Aunt Through Letters; Initially Sending Threatening Letters Demanding 10,000 Yuan, Then Claiming to Be Kidnapped Was a Ruse; Both Perpetrators Apprehended and Punished Separately

After the death of Zhang Bingxin, the owner of Wanxinchang Jewelry Store and a local resident, he left behind two concubines and a daughter: the elder concubine, Qin; the younger concubine, Dai; the daughter, Haoju; and an adopted son, Fubao. His estate, worth over 100,000 yuan, was legally analyzed by lawyer Shen Weihan. Recently, Zhang Qin and Zhang Dai suddenly received threatening letters from gangsters, bearing the name "Zhong," stating that the writer had a deep-seated feud with Zhang Bingxin and originally intended to take revenge by kidnapping Haoju, Zhang's biological daughter, and his real estate in the South City to vent his anger. Now, to settle the matter peacefully, they demanded 10,000 yuan in legal tender; otherwise, they would carry out their original plan. At the time, the Zhangs did not respond. However, on the 30th of last month, Zhang received a phone call stating that her nephew, Qin Dequan, had been kidnapped and taken to the Yangtze Hotel, demanding an immediate ransom of 10,000 yuan; otherwise, Qin would be sent to Hongkou, and Haoju would suffer the same fate. In desperation, Zhang reported the matter to the Laozha Police Station. Detective Chen Ruisheng investigated and found that the phone call to the Zhang family came from room 519 of the Yangtze Hotel. He stormed into the room and found only Qin Dequan inside.

There were no signs of kidnappers. He was taken to the police station. Qin confessed that he had incurred gambling debts and devised this scheme to extort 10,000 yuan to cover his losses. He also implicated Qin Dingsen as an accomplice. Qin Dingsen was apprehended and handed over to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Feng Shide held a further hearing. Qin Dequan hired lawyer Tang Youwei, and Qin Dingsen hired lawyer Jin Xinmin to defend them. The police station's lawyer, Ru Baoyi, argued that the defendants'

malice was extreme and requested severe punishment. Both defendants confessed to the crime but blamed each other for initiating the scheme. After mutual arguments from both lawyers, Judge Feng announced the verdict: Qin Dequan was sentenced to one year and six months in prison, and Qin Dingsen was sentenced to one year in prison as a warning.

### Grand Funeral of Cao Bingsheng

Following the tragic assassination of Cao Bingsheng, the Chief Inspector of the Political Department of the French Concession Police, on the 6th of this month, his funeral was held this afternoon with great solemnity. A procession started from the mortuary on Route Tenant de la Tour. A French policeman on a bicycle and four Chinese policemen led the way along Avenue Edward VII, Rue Chapsal, Rue Massenet, Avenue Joffre, Rue du Pere Froc, and Avenue Paulins, finally arriving at the Shanghai Funeral Parlor, where the coffin was temporarily placed, awaiting burial at a later date. Observers watched quietly, without a sound. Yesterday's pallbearers included Colonel Fabre, the Chief Medical Officer of the French Concession; Fabre, the Commander of the French Army Defense Headquarters in Shanghai; Chief Inspector Elphege and Deputy Chief Inspector Liang Bingjun; Godebert, the head of the French Volunteer Corps; Davis, the Inspector-General of the French Concession Special Police; Laurance, the head of the French Concession Fire Department; representatives from the French Navy and the French Municipal Council; senior officials from the French Concession Police; district chiefs; representatives from various departments; representatives from the Public Concession Police; and representatives from the French Army and Navy in Shanghai. The coffin was guarded by twenty special policemen from the French Concession Police, armed with rifles. Following them were the French Concession Police band, two platoons of Vietnamese police, and one platoon of Russian police, forming an extremely grand and mournful procession. Those who sent wreaths that day included the French Ambassador, the French Consul-General, the Director-General of the French Municipal Council Police, Fabre, the Public Concession Police, the President of the Second Special District Court, the French Army Headquarters in Shanghai, and various substations of the French Concession Police, too numerous to mention.

It is noted that Cao graduated from Xuhui Middle School and was always at the top of his class, which is still fondly remembered by teachers and students. He was very devoted to his wife after marrying Miss Sun. Therefore, Madam Sun Cao personally wrote an article and placed it in the coffin, mourning Mr. Cao. Madam Sun is a bright student in Qingxin Girls' Middle School, so grief is overflowing on paper in her text. The text is recorded as follows: "My deceased husband, Bingsheng, the tears in your wife's eyes are as bright as crystal. It is a pity that your love for me was not exhausted, and you sacrificed for the country too early. Only the day of final victory will be the time your wife follows her husband. You were thirty, and I am twenty-six. I should have died with you in the same year, month, day, and hour. You are spiritually immortal, and my jade body is not yet decayed. Your loving wife, Xu Ying, cries and writes."

### Extorting a Bicycle Shop, Four Criminals Arrested and To Be Sent to Court Today

At around 2:50 PM on the day before yesterday (the 8th), Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession Police, along with officers from the Chengdu Road Police Station, arrested four extortionists at the Dasanyuan Cantonese restaurant on the second floor of 15 Yujiaqing Road. The four were identified as Li Yulin, 23, from Pudong; Chen Quangen, 28, from Chongming; and Zhang Genfa, 18, from Chongming. The gang had previously sent a letter to the Dayu Bicycle Shop on Jules Ferry Road, demanding 7,000 yuan under threat and arranging to meet at the French Park on the 6th to negotiate. After the shop owner reported the matter to the French Concession Police, detectives were dispatched in disguise to wait. However, the criminals did not dare to appear. On the following day (the 7th), another letter was received, rescheduling the meeting for 2:00 PM to 8:00 PM on the 8th at the Dasanyuan restaurant opposite the Great World. Upon receiving the report, the French Concession Police immediately sent detectives, together with officers from the Chengdu Road Police Station, to arrest them. They were taken to the French Concession Police Station for detention. After preliminary interrogation by the police chief, the facts were confirmed, and the criminals will be sent to the Second Special Court today for further investigation.

### Embezzling Payment for Goods, Sentenced to Eight Months Imprisonment

Lan Caizhi, a Cantonese man and the owner of the business department of Fuan Department Store at 8 Jing'an Temple Road, was found to have embezzled 446 yuan from the Xianghe Tobacco and Paper Shop on Avenue Joffre on the 28th of last month. Xianghe Tobacco had ordered two cases of 2nd Opium Brand cigarettes at 446 yuan, paying 346 yuan upfront and promising the remaining 100 yuan upon delivery. However, Xianghe Tobacco never received the goods. When they inquired of Mr. Lan, they found that the remaining funds had been misappropriated by Mr. Lan. The money went to a Caojiadu gambling den. The incident was discovered by the manager of Fuan Company. The New Gate Police Station was contacted. The New Gate police sent an officer to arrest Mr. Lan. Investigations found that Mr. Lan had used the same tactics to embezzle 512 yuan from the Qiantaixin Tobacco and Paper Shop on New Gate Road. He was handed over to the court for interrogation and detention. The case was tried in court yesterday morning and the facts were shown clearly by the judge. Lan Caizhi was sentenced to eight months imprisonment for embezzlement of materials held during business operation.

### Workers of the Great China Shipbuilding Factory Detained, Suspected of Arson

Pudong Motorboats Thrown with Grenades and Burned, Fifteen Workers Detained for Interrogation

Regarding the case of the workers detained by the Great China Shipbuilding Factory in Dinghai, new developments have emerged. According to workers at the factory, fifteen workers from Jiangbei have been detained by the Japanese army at the factory and sent to Hongkou, their fate unknown. The incident is said to be more serious than previously reported. On the afternoon of the 6th, someone threw a large amount of sulfur at more than thirty motorboats moored by the river at the factory, setting them on fire. Three motorboats caught fire and were destroyed. Two hand grenades were found in another motorboat. The sailors on board quickly threw them into the river, preventing them from exploding. After the incident, the Japanese side, noting that the factory faces the river and is surrounded by police lines on all sides, suspected that dangerous elements had infiltrated the factory. All workers were detained for about thirty hours, stripped of their clothes, and thoroughly searched. They were given no food or drink. Two foremen were whipped. Finally, fifteen Jiangbei workers were forced to identify as suspects in the grenade throwing and arson, and they were detained for further investigation. The rest of the workers were then released.

### Transfer of Vienna Dance Hall, Sued for Fraud; Agreement Reached But Not Honored, Identity of Plaintiff Still Questionable

Chi Zhenmin, who used to operate the Cathay Dance Hall and once managed the Sinah Dance Hall, and Zhao Zhongdi, the former head of the dance hostesses at the Cathay and Sinah Dance Halls, along with Xu Weizhou, the former manager of Sinah, were good friends through their shared work. In January of this year, Xu Weizhou introduced the transfer of the Vienna Garden Dance Hall on Dahua Road in West Shanghai to Pan Sanxing and others from the Ji Ji Company. After several rounds of negotiations, Chi Zhenmin,

representing the selling party's shareholders, and Ji Ji signed a preliminary agreement for the transfer. The price was 20,000 yuan in national currency, to be paid in two installments of 4,600 yuan by the buyer. Later, some of the original shareholders objected, claiming that Chi had no right to represent the sale. Although the buyer repeatedly negotiated with Chi, the guarantor Zhao Zhongdi, and the intermediary Xu Weizhou, they have been unable to take over the business, and the money paid has not been recovered. The buyer believes that the actions of Chi, Zhao, and Xu

constitute fraud and has filed a criminal complaint with the First Special District Court, requesting legal punishment. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo held a hearing. The defendants Zhao and Xu appeared in court with their lawyer, Le Junwei. Chi did not appear. Chi's wife hired lawyer Qian Zheng to appear in court, stating that Chi was unaware of the lawsuit and had left town on business, so he could not attend. The plaintiff, Cheng Tieyin, also did not appear in person. His lawyer

presented the indictment, stating that in January, Xu Weizhou told the plaintiff that the shareholders of Vienna had no intention of continuing the business and wanted to transfer it. At that time, Chi Zhenmin claimed to be the general manager of Vienna and had full authority to represent the sale. They agreed on a price of 20,000 yuan and signed a preliminary agreement on January 23, paying a deposit of 3,000 yuan, 600 yuan to repay debts, and 1,000 yuan for expenses, with the handover scheduled for three days later. However, the next day, lawyers Jiang and Jiang, representing certain shareholders,

objected to the transfer, claiming that Chi had no right to sell. When questioned, Chi claimed that the matter could be resolved. When the three-day period expired, the handover could not be completed. However, on February 17, Chi and others continued to collect another 2,300

five yuan from the plaintiff under the pretext of paying the dance hostesses, claiming that the handover would be completed after three days. However, the deadline passed without fulfillment. Negotiations have continued until now, with no hope of taking over the business, and the 6,000 yuan paid not being returned. Such fraud should be

unforgivable by law. Therefore, they request a trial and have submitted the preliminary agreement and receipts as evidence. Xu claimed that he only helped estimate the value and did not participate in the other matters. Zhao claimed that the buyer was Pan Sanxing of Ji Ji Company and had nothing to do with Cheng. The court stated that the case required further investigation and rescheduled the hearing.

### Li Yongkuan and Sons Case, Continued Hearing Yesterday

Li Sick in Prison, Case Still Under Investigation

The notorious salt smuggler Li Yongkuan from Anhui, along with his second son Li Jiazhou and youngest son Li Bihua, had previously gathered bandits to commit murder and robbery, sparing nothing. They forcibly abducted women She Yuexian and Lin Xiuhua and forcibly married them to his second son Jiazhou and youngest son Bihua. Last year, they brought Lin and She to Shanghai, renting a house at No. 11 in the middle section of Ciyou Road in Xujiahui, West Shanghai. They locked Lin and She in the house and sent people to guard them, not allowing them any freedom. Until the morning of December 10 last year, Lin and She were able to escape and seek refuge at the Catholic Church's Sacred Mother's Convent,

requesting assistance. After the convent took them in and learned the details, they reported the matter to the French Concession Police, who dispatched officers to arrest Li and his sons. Stolen items, such as gold bracelets and gold rings from the Lin and She families, were found in the Li's residence. After investigation by the French Concession Police, the case was transferred to the Second Special District Court for prosecution according to law. Later, due to jurisdictional issues, the Second Special District Court requested the Third Branch of the High Court to transfer the case to the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Shanghai High Court, which designated the Second Special District Court to handle the trial.

Previous court hearings have been reported in detail. This case was continued yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM. Defendant Li Yongkuan was unable to appear due to illness in detention, so only his sons Li Jiazhou and Li Bihua appeared. The plaintiffs, Lin and She, also appeared with their lawyer, recounting the dates of the robberies, their forced marriages, and the three robberies in their homes in vivid detail. When questioned, defendants Li Jiazhou and Li Bihua vehemently denied the robbery and murder, claiming that the marriages were arranged by the parents of both parties. The court also summoned Li Yongkuan's mistress, Li Yao, to court. She was informed that her previous request for bail for Li Yongkuan had been denied due to the seriousness of the case.

Bail cannot be given, and he is currently detained in the detention center. He has been denied visitation. She can visit him, and if he is seriously ill, there are doctors in the detention center to treat him. Ms. Li said that her husband had first suffered from typhoid fever and now was coughing up blood and severely ill. She also brought out contradictory evidence, saying that the gold ring had been pawned by her son-in-law Zhang, but she could not answer what his name was. Li Jiazhou and Li Bihua were also unable to provide the surname of their brother-in-law. At this point, the court stated that the case required further investigation. It was adjourned to May 23 for another hearing, and the defendants were remanded in custody.

### Gang of Thieves Conspiring Illegal Activities, All Caught in One Sweep

Related to the Mazaki Road Robbery, Interrogation Completed, Awaiting Investigation

Chinese detectives Li Yinmin, Chen Jinsheng, and Wang Qishan from the New Gate Detention Center learned that a large group of bandits were feasting and plotting illegal activities at a hotel at 98 Burton Road. They coordinated with Western detectives and secretly went to the location yesterday afternoon, arresting eleven bandits from Jiangbei: Chen Youfa, Zhang Jinbiao (also known as Sanguozi), Jiang Jinlin, Guo Peiju, Zhang Qilian, Zhang Ganyuan, Li Xu, and others. A handgun and three bullets were found on Chen Youfa. Zhang Jinbiao then led Chinese and Western detectives to No. 97 opposite, where they apprehended Zhang Guozhen, Zhang Zhengming, and Zhang Zhang. Another handgun and six bullets were found in the attic. They then went to a leather shed on Mazaki Road and Room 21 of the Huning Hotel on Kenon Road, arresting five accomplices: Dong Xiaowuzi, Sun Jincai, Guan Zhang, Chen Bingsan, and Wang Zishan. They were all taken to the detention center. It was discovered that these individuals were responsible for the attempted armed robbery of the Xieyu Transportation Company at 19 Mazaki Road on the 27th of last month. The officers reported to police, and a detective shot and killed one bandit. The suspects were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Zhu Zhishan, presented the case and requested a postponement of

the detention to continue the investigation. After Judge Xiao questioned each defendant one by one, he approved the detention for fourteen days before another hearing.

### Checker Shows Off Power and Insults Spectators

At the Guangji Theater at the intersection of Edward Road and Chengdu Road, during the 9:00 PM showing of the fourth episode of "Burning the Red Lotus Temple" the night before (the 8th), the audience was extremely crowded. An old man was unable to purchase a ticket. Something happened

with Checker X, who was violent and wanted to drag the old man into the room. After much argument, they parted unhappily. However, after the old man left, the checker was still not finished. Some spectators were angry. The checker and his colleagues dragged the two spectators into the office, wanted to give them a hard time and even closed the iron gate, not allowing anyone out. The entire audience became furious, immediately smashed the glass advertising signs in the theater, and even wanted to destroy the large glass window at the entrance. Seeing the situation was bad, the theater opened the iron gate and released the two detained spectators. At that time, the police were informed and sent detectives to suppress the disturbance. The spectators dispersed, and the dispute was resolved.

### How Many Floating Corpses in the Huangpu River? Another Man Drowned Himself Yesterday

### Xi Liangji Traditional Chinese Medicine Shop Treats the World with Good Medicine

The Grand Performance of the 34th Episode of "Journey to the West"

Since the Xinji Grand Theater on Erma Road began staging the complete "Journey to the West", every episode has been sold out. Last night's premiere of the 34th episode of "Journey to the West" was not only packed inside, but the cars and carriages on the side of Erma Road were also so crowded that traffic was almost blocked. This is due to the tight and well-matched plot, the elaborate sets for each scene, and the efforts of the leading actors. For example, Zhang X Peng played two roles in this episode, which is his first time taking on this feat. Therefore, the strength of the performance created a new record. This shows that the theater's manager, Fan Hengde, is thoughtful and runs the theater in a well organized manner.

Science and Life

### Science for Amateurs

— Ji Qian

Most people think that science is the most profound and complex of all academic disciplines, and that it is impossible to grasp its intricacies without studying at school under the guidance of a good teacher. This view is mistaken. In fact, science can be learned by anyone and is no different from other academic disciplines. The key is to find the right method and to have perseverance and determination. Many Europeans and Americans study science in their spare time as a form of recreation. Through persistent effort, they have achieved great accomplishments. The British Lubbock is one such example. Lubbock initially worked in a bank, then became a Member of Parliament. He never left the world of finance and politics, working diligently day and night. However, whenever he had a moment to spare, he would use scientific work to amuse himself. His research covered a wide range of fields, including geology, archaeology, botany, zoology, anthropology, and sociology, all of which he explored diligently and to which he made significant contributions. His most outstanding work was in microscopic anatomy, the classification of lower crustaceans, and experiments on the instincts of various insects. His achievements were in no way inferior to those of professional experts. Darwin once exclaimed, "I truly do not know where you find the time to make such contributions." Another example is Swinhoe, the British consul in China more than seventy years ago, who served in Zhenjiang, Ningbo, Shantou, and other places. In his spare time, he studied the mammals of China, constantly discovering new species. Many of his papers were published in the reports of the Zoological Society of London. He became famous as an authority on Chinese mammology, and even today, experts around the world still praise his work. The customs official La Touche devoted his spare time to the study of Chinese birds, tirelessly publishing many reports and eventually writing a specialized book on Chinese birds, which is popular in the world of ornithology. All of these individuals made good use of their spare time, engaged in noble hobbies, promoted the progress of learning, increased human knowledge, and ultimately achieved lasting fame. In our country, many people waste their time playing mahjong, going to theaters, or dancing, which harms their health and wastes their money. It is not worth it at all. It is hoped that people will learn from these examples and strive to improve themselves.

### Methods of Water Purification

— Ze Nan

Water covers 70% of the Earth's surface. We cannot live without water in our daily lives, whether we drink it or use it. Even the human body is 70% water. This shows how important water is to human life.

Although there is so much water, it is not easy to obtain pure water. Everyone knows that seawater contains salt. River water and well water also contain minerals and other impurities. Even rainwater carries a lot of dust and bacteria when it falls from the sky. Therefore, after we collect natural water, we must first purify it by various methods before we can use it. There are many ways to purify water. Now, I will briefly discuss some of the major uses.

A. Water for Scientific and Industrial Use. In laboratories or factories, it is sometimes necessary to use relatively pure water. In particular, water containing minerals can damage boilers and make experiments inaccurate. Therefore, minerals must be removed first. The most common method is distillation, which involves evaporating the water into steam, leaving the impurities in the container. The steam is then passed through a condenser to convert it back into water. This method yields the purest water, but it is difficult to produce and very expensive.

B. Household Water. The water used in households must also be reasonably clean, and the bacteria in the water should be killed to make it suitable for drinking. The most common method of sterilization is to boil the water, which kills all the bacteria. Although boiled water still contains minerals, it is generally beneficial to human health. Sometimes we pass water through several layers of sand and charcoal to remove most of the impurities and some of the bacteria. This is the common method of sand filtration.

C. Urban Water. In modern metropolises, millions of residents rely on tap water. Therefore, the cleanliness of tap water is even more important to the health of residents. However, large amounts of water cannot be disinfected by distillation or boiling. The only way is to adopt the following steps:

1. Add alum to the water to cause a chemical reaction, forming a gelatinous suspension of aluminum hydroxide, which gradually combines with the impurities, bacteria, and coloring agents in the water and settles. This method is commonly used in households.

2. Filter the water that has been treated above through sand. Commonly, water filtration ponds are used, lined with several layers of fine and coarse sand. Some also use mechanical methods to filter the water very quickly. Some of the impurities in the water are filtered out by the sand, and some are decomposed by the gelatinous substances accumulated on the surface of the pond. If the first step is not taken, the effect is relatively weak if the water is slowly filtered through the pond.

3. Finally, pass chlorine or ozone into the water to kill the bacteria by using nascent oxygen. With this extra careful method, very clean water can be obtained.

Water softening method: That is, remove the sulfates and chlorides of calcium or magnesium contained in hard water. Chemical agents such as sodium carbonate, calcium hydroxide, and sodium aluminum silicate can be added to the water to allow these minerals to precipitate out on their own. Soft water can save soap and prevent damage to water containers. Although this method does not fall within the scope of water purification, it is briefly mentioned because it is very important for industrial and household water use.

### Concealed Wireless Device: Secretly Reporting Burglaries

— Rong Li

Robbers often threaten their victims, making them raise their hands and forbidding them from moving, then calmly searching for valuables. The victims can only let them do as they please, with no recourse. Now, an inventor in Chicago has created a set of wireless devices that allow victims to send alarms even with their hands raised. The device is completely concealed inside the chest of the clothing. In the event of a robbery, simply take a breath to expand the chest, then use the chest strap to tighten and press the switch, which connects the circuit, and an automatic small transmitter immediately sends an alarm to the central receiving agency. The device is said to be designed specifically for bank clerks, cash escorts, and night watchmen.

### Talking About Multiple Births (II)

— Liu Hanshi

In the twelfth issue of this publication, we have already discussed some examples of multiple births and their causes and biological explanations. Now we must further conduct statistical observations and genetic investigations.

According to expert research, women between the ages of thirty-five and forty are most likely to have multiple births, because this is the period when women's reproductive capacity is at its peak. According to the statistical research of Dr. Helin in Germany, there is one set of twins in every eighty births; one set of triplets in eighty squared (equals 6,400) births; one set of quadruplets in eighty cubed (equals 512,000) births; and one set of quintuplets in eighty to the fourth power (equals 40,960,000) births. This formula is now generally accepted.

However, Professor W. W. Grenlieh of the University of Colorado in the United States disagrees with Dr. Helin's calculation method. Based on his own research of 100 million birth records, he created a different formula. According to his statement, there is one set of twins in every eighty-seven births; one set of triplets in eighty-seven squared (equals 7,569) births; one set of quadruplets in eighty-seven cubed (equals 658,503) births; and similarly, one set of quintuplets in eighty-seven to the fourth power (equals 57,286,761) births. Now, let us use formulas to show the differences between the calculation methods of Helin and Grenlieh:

|                  | Twins        | Triplets        | Quadruplets     | Quintuplets      |
|------------------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Helin's Method   | 80           | 6,400           | 512,000         | 40,960,000        |
| Grenlieh's Method| 87           | 7,569           | 658,503         | 57,286,761        |
| Difference       | 7            | 1,169           | 146,503         | 16,326,761       |

From the table above, the calculation methods of Helin and Grenlieh are not much different at the beginning, but the difference becomes larger and larger later on. At the fourth power, the difference is as large as 16,326,761 births. In other words, according to Helin's algorithm, the Canadian Dionne quintuplets could be produced once in only 40.96 million births, but according to Grenlieh's algorithm, there is a possibility of one set of quintuplets being produced in 57,286,761 births. With such rare opportunities, of course, the Dionne quintuplets are precious, and plus they are the same sex, which are of genetic research value, it is even more rare. At the same time, all five daughters are alive, no wonder they shocked the world.

According to genetics, multiple births have a bloodline genetic relationship. According to the results of the investigation, in the family of Madam Bing, who gave birth to one set of twins (two girls and one boy), one brother and one sister had both given birth to twins. Madam Bai, who gave birth to one set of quadruplets (four girls), also came from a family that had given birth to twins. As for Madam Dionne, who gave birth to quintuplets, there had also been twins in her maternal family. These are all useful records that can be used as good materials for studying human genetics. Readers, if you have the opportunity to meet twins, triplets, or preferably quintuplets, you can also visit their families to see if anyone has given birth to multiple births before. According to my prediction, there must have been. There is also one point: if readers discover that a family has given birth to quadruplets or quintuplets, they can also follow the foreign example and report to the central government to apply for a bonus. I think that at this high tide of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when people are needed, and multiple births are worthy of reward, the government will definitely be willing to pay a large bonus.

### Why Plants Need to Be Sparse

— Tai Min

Everyone knows that if cotton or corn is planted too densely, the harvest may not be good. Similarly, trees grow very slowly in crowded conditions. To promote their growth, they must be thinned out like cotton or corn.

The attached diagram shows a cross-section of a pine tree. This tree grew in an overly dense state early in its life. Its diameter only grew to five inches in twenty-nine years. But after the forest in which it was located was thinned out, its diameter increased by seven inches in fifteen years. In other words, the rate of growth was two and a half times faster than before thinning.

Scientific Anecdotes

### Chasing Ghosts

— He Shan

A farmer in a certain place raised horses and accumulated a lot of straw. Near the farmyard was a burial ground. At night, sounds of mournful wails were often heard, which terrified the residents, who believed it to be the crying of ghosts. At dusk, no one dared to pass through the area, and even those who lived nearby moved away. There was an old man who was naturally strong. One evening, he was returning home and passed by the area when he suddenly heard the sound coming from the straw pile. He was not afraid, and he wanted to get to the bottom of the strange noise, thinking that chasing ghosts in the dark was a heroic act. So he carried his lantern and followed the sound, entering the straw pile and pursuing it relentlessly. Suddenly, the light flickered, and he caught a glimpse of something like a small dog leaping in front of him. Upon closer inspection, it was a grass fox. It was still howling mournfully. He then realized that the so-called ghost cries were none other than this. From then on, the ghost cries stopped. He asked the farmer to clear the accumulated straw and found a hole in the ground underneath, with many discarded feathers and broken bones inside, which was the fox's usual dwelling place. The doubts and fears of the people were dispelled in one day. His efforts to seek truth and clarify the true picture is also the spirit of scientific research.

Artificial Modification of Animal Morphology

The morphology of various animals is passed down from generation to generation and generally does not undergo special changes. Now scientists are trying to change them artificially. Dr. V. C. Twotty of Stanford University in the United States has performed delicate surgery on amphibians like stone cages, resulting in several newts with fused limbs and several with unusually different head and eye positions. He recently transformed a purely brown newt into a spotted newt. This is another new contribution he has made to the scientific community. His modification method involves taking a piece of pigment cells from a common spotted species and transplanting it onto the embryo of a pure-colored species that is one-quarter of its length. He experimented with newts because this modification method can be continuously applied to them. His method is currently only applied to animals, but in the future, it may be applied to the pigments and morphology of the human body.

Sexual Health

### The Value of Sexual Love and Spiritual Love in Married Life

— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Some people say that the reason why couples get along well is because their temperaments are compatible, which leads to their spiritual integration. However, spiritual harmony only leads the love between the two parties into a state of complacency. If they want to maintain it permanently, they still need to coordinate in terms of inner desires. This point cannot be hidden from discerning people. As long as men and women with sharp observation skills can perceive it in their daily lives. For this reason, the pain felt by a patient with premature ejaculation and impotence is indeed beyond the imagination of outsiders.

A physiologically mature girl needs a partner of the opposite sex very much because her body is constantly stimulated. At this time, her blood is full, and she longs for spring love. Although she still does not know what sexual life is all about, she is generally very clear about her responsibility to bear children. However, if she marries an ignorant husband, the joy she gets from carnal desire can be said to be very little. At this time, if her husband is healthy and full of energy, then he can immediately lead his wife to a state of unparalleled joy, making her suddenly realize that marriage has its own precious value in the history of life, and then can make the feelings between husband and wife grow day by day, and realize the happy life of husband singing and wife following.

If the husband is a licentious man who indulges in masturbation and is addicted to sex before marriage, resulting in weakening of sexual function, then the wife will be greatly disappointed, and her heart will be hurt, which will reduce her love for you. If this continues, the tragedy of family breakdown will be inevitable sooner or later.

There is no more opportunity to study these obstacles to sexual life than that of doctors, so I especially advise patients to actively implement sexual endocrine therapy to completely cure them.

For stubborn and long-standing impotence, taking the testicular secretion preparation "Bu Jian Kang" can show very effective results. This preparation is fast and permanent, can make the mind clear, increase weight, and rejuvenate. I have used this preparation to treat the above symptoms, and have never encountered a case of failure in seven years. Therefore, this preparation has been praised by countless Chinese and Western doctors. Its female "Bu Jian Kang" functions to regulate menstruation and seeds, and is a holy medicine for gynecology.

### Secret Recipe for Relieving Cough and Treating Lungs

— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang

Whether it is traditional Chinese medicine or Western medicine, coughs are difficult to treat. Therefore, lung diseases are more common than any infectious disease, and their mortality rate is indeed alarming. Therefore, people should not think that colds and coughs are minor illnesses and not treat them. If they unfortunately turn into lung disease due to the failure to treat the cough, then the patient should not be pessimistic. In fact, lung disease is not as terrible as some doctors say. As long as you take care of yourself and get the right treatment, there is nothing mysterious about it. According to my experience, the medicine "Bu Fei Na Er" has a special effect on relieving coughs and treating the lungs. Even if the disease has progressed to the second or third stage with hemoptysis, taking this medicine can absolutely cure it. However, during the treatment period, you should rest and avoid labor, and take more nutritious food, so that the disease will be easier to cure. This is the condition for lung disease to be cured.

Modern Medicine

### Internal and External Treatment of Spermatorrhea

— Described by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

If you just want to rely on local surgery and general chemotherapy and membrane sterilization therapy, and do not think from reality, but want to cure gonorrhea, it is like climbing a ladder to pick the moon, which will never be realized. This is the reason why gonorrhea has failed in the past when using these therapies alone. Based on this reason, it is no wonder that Leukocytosisentherape, which increases white blood cells, can meet the world in the most novel and radical posture among many vulgar therapies. This is indeed unprecedented. The principle of increasing white blood cell therapy is as follows:

The so-called white blood cell therapy is to increase the number of white blood cells in the human body by using protein bodies to enhance the killing of lymphococci in the blood, and on the one hand, to eliminate inflammation of the urethra with a special yellow pigment. Therefore, all diseases in acute gonorrhea can be quickly cured, and chronic gonorrhea can also be quickly cured due to the fundamental elimination of lymphococci. This protein body yellow pigment combination has been tested on the spot by experts in internationally renowned large hospitals, proving that this special medicine for gonorrhea is unexpected. The name of this special medicine is "Ke Lin Nong", which will eliminate the pain of tens of millions of gonorrhea patients and restore their health. For all those who have acute and chronic gonorrhea, who have been nourished by taking other medicines, or who have not been cured by other surgical procedures, taking "Ke Lin Nong" can be guaranteed to be completely resolved in three to five weeks. For external use, you can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water", and women can use "Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. However, you can treat yourself at home according to the diagram and instructions, which is especially safe.

### Pornographic Books Can Inspire Masturbation

— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

During the period when youth are sexually active, due to the hormones in the body, those with weak will are easily induced by erotic books and romantic novels, which inspires the motive for masturbation and promotes the main cause of underdevelopment and neurasthenia. In addition, after reading erotic books and pictures, bad phenomena remain in the brain, which leads to fantasy, and finally leads to the explosion of spermatorrhea. Therefore, young people during the developmental period should avoid ridiculous and obscene novels, books and paintings. Even those who have been harmed by erotic books and have exploded the above symptoms should seek effective and reliable treatments in addition to trying their best to recuperate. There is no reason not to completely cure them.

Now there is a patient named Cao Junmin, 19 years old, from Shaanxi (self-report)——When I was 16 years old, a friend gave me a erotic novel, which I read day and night, even forgetting to eat and drink. I was also induced by bad friends, so I indulged in the bad habit of masturbation to comfort myself. Three months later, I began to experience spermatorrhea. At first, it only happened two or three times a month, but later it gradually increased to one or two times a week. At this time, I realized the harm of masturbation. Although I tried hard to quit, it was completely ineffective. I seek treatment, etc. (Treatment process)——I ordered him to recuperate and quit masturbation, take "Nair's Spermatorrhea Tablets" to stop spermatorrhea, and also take the testicular essence preparation for men "Bu Ti Kang" to nourish the deficiency. After two months of treatment, his health gradually recovered.

Gonorrhea Forum

### Husband and Wife Without Children Due to Gonorrhea

— Written by Physician Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

Lively and smart children are the link between the love of husband and wife. Life feels empty if you reach a considerable age and still have no children. Therefore, all diseases that hinder reproductive function must be fundamentally resolved as early as possible to avoid regret. Taking gonorrhea as an example, its bad consequences often lead to the tragedy of childlessness, which causes the love that is as close as glue to disintegrate due to the barrenness of the knees, which is truly regrettable. And the wife is even more often subjected to unjustified grievances.

Although there are many symptoms of infertility caused by gonorrhea, none has a greater impact on our reproductive capacity than gonorrheal prostatitis. The reason is that prostatic fluid has the elements to nourish sperm, and its position in reproduction is second only to the testicles, and it can even be said to be in the same position as the testicles. Therefore, it must not be ignored. Because once the prostate stops its secretory function, it cannot nourish sperm. In addition, due to the contraction of scars during prostatitis and the blockage of glandular tubes, reproductive capacity is lacking, resulting in infertility. As for women, if gonorrhea has spread to the fallopian tubes, the fallopian tubes will become inflamed and blocked, and they will naturally be unable to conceive. Therefore, couples who have been married and know that they have gonorrhea must be treated at the same time to restore the ability to reproduce. Based on my experience of more than 20 years, the German Yang-Electric Therapy is most effective for the fundamental treatment of gonorrheal prostatitis, and "Ke Lin Nong" in internal medicine can indeed be called the holy medicine among internal medicines for gonorrhea. The reason is that "Ke Lin Nong" has the magical power to surround the gonorrheal lesions and devour the lymphococci with its bactericidal power. Therefore, gonorrheal prostatitis and female fallopian tube inflammation can be effective in a short period of time after taking it. It can also immediately restore secretory function, and the distress of couples who have lost children due to gonorrhea can be fundamentally eliminated. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 consultations are given every day, and each consultation costs only 5 jiao.

Commercial News

### Finance Supply and Demand are Balanced, Gold Market is Quiet, Only Five Yuan Difference All Day

Yesterday, the cash market was calm, with fluctuations of only five yuan throughout the day. Prices hovered around 2,130 yuan. Although a certain gold firm bought aggressively on behalf of clients and cash firms followed suit, another gold firm strongly supplied, and a certain bank also sold on behalf of outsiders, coupled with slight selling by securities firms and speculative buyers, the supply and demand were balanced, resulting in a mediocre situation. The result was a slight drop of one yuan. Trading was still active throughout the day, reaching 1,050 taels. There were no changes in jewelry gold prices at silver shops. The customs gold and Sino-British pure gold prices remained unchanged.

Slight Drop of One Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened relatively flat. Initially, a certain money exchange and silver shops each bought 50 taels at 2,132 yuan, one yuan higher than the closing price the previous night. After the opening, securities firms suddenly sold, and a certain bank also showed selling interest, causing the market to decline and fall into the 2,130 yuan range. At this time, a certain Yu firm took the opportunity to aggressively buy on behalf of South China, turning the situation from weak to stable. A certain gold firm bought 50 taels each from securities firms, silver shops, and other firms, all at 2,129 yuan. Subsequently, it bought another 50 taels from a certain bank at the same price. Later, a certain cash firm also followed suit and bought from a consultant, and a certain money exchange and a certain bank each sold 50 taels at 2,129 yuan as well. Soon, a certain gold firm came again and bought 50 taels from a certain bank at 2,129.5 yuan, and another 50 taels from a certain money exchange at 2,129 yuan. Later, a certain cash firm bought another 50 taels from a money exchange at 2,129.5 yuan. Shortly after, a certain gold firm bought 200 taels from other firms at 2,129 yuan. After that, the supply became scarce, and the price immediately rebounded to over 2,130 yuan. A certain gold firm bought another 50 taels from another firm at 2,132 yuan. After that, a certain gold firm still had appetite at 2,132 yuan, but sellers were hesitant, so no deals were made. Therefore, the midday closing price remained at 2,132 yuan. In the afternoon, silver shops also slightly bought, and a certain gold firm continued to search for purchases, causing the initial opening price to rise by one yuan. Silver shops and a certain gold firm bought a total of 100 taels from gold firms at 2,134 yuan. Later, as buyers' interest waned and money exchanges took advantage of the high prices to sell, the price fell back. Money exchanges sold 50 taels to silver shops at 2,130 yuan. At this time, a certain gold firm bought another 50 taels from a money exchange at 2,132 yuan. After that, money exchanges traded among themselves for 50 taels, with the evening closing price at 2,130 yuan. As a result, the closing price was one yuan lower than the previous day's evening closing price. The selling price of cash firms' own-brand gold was 2,135 yuan, and the buying price was 2,125 yuan. The spot gold price was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and no deals were made.

Jewelry Gold Prices Unchanged

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael at silver shops remained unchanged. Da Tong Hang still quoted the original price of 216 yuan, while Xin Tong Hang quoted 214 yuan, with a buying price of 208 yuan.

Pure Gold Prices Also Unchanged

According to an eighth-day London dispatch, the price of British pure gold remained unchanged at £7 8s 6d per ounce, resulting in the Central Bank of China's cash buying price also remaining unchanged at 1,212.3 yuan. The listed customs gold price also remained flat, at 2.3246 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained unchanged at 1,207.6 yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Futures Stable with a Slight Loosening

Although the foreign exchange market saw aggressive buying by the Bank of England (acting on behalf of Tianjin) and major foreign firms yesterday, the result was difficult to change as foreign firms such as HSBC were still willing to continuously supply. However, it was heard that the futures market was slightly looser in a stable manner due to heavier selling interest from foreign firms. Trading was quite sparse.

### Yarn and Cotton Speculative Buyers Return to Buy, Yarn Prices Rise Despite Expectations of Decline, But Actual Demand Remains Sluggish, Total Sales Less Than 300 Bales

The yarn market fell in the morning and rebounded in the afternoon, and the situation became somewhat calm. The reason is that the extent of the continuous decline in recent days has been very deep. Today's low price is 39 yuan lower than the peak price last week, which has attracted powerful buyers to buy in. As a result, speculative sentiment has stabilized slightly, and market prices have turned around and rebounded. This situation was also expected and is not surprising, because the decline was too severe, so there must have been a small rebound at one point. However, actual demand remains sluggish and shows no signs of development. In the afternoon, it was heard that Japanese yarn had rebounded after falling, and people's sentiment was raised. Trading in yarn certificates in the market suddenly became excited, and selling prices suddenly rose by 3-4 yuan. Inquiring about the market situation, generally large households are in a long position, and their will has never changed. They continue to buy in and hoard during periods of weakness and will not give up.

The current situation of yarn is still scattered and weak in the early morning opening. It is true that the sales of current yarn are not strong, and even fewer customers inquire. The opening price fell by 1 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 414 yuan. However, speculative buyers came to buy and maintain the certificate price, and the original price of the previous day was 406.5 yuan. The asking price of unpopular 20-count yarn is lower, but the bargaining price is very low, and people's sentiment is still depressed. The market gradually declined. Until the close, some small households sold the certificate price of 20-count Double Horse yarn for only 404.5 yuan, and the spot price of foreign yarn was 412 yuan. The afternoon opening was still flat, and suddenly turned upward, because Japanese yarn rose again, people's sentiment increased, the certificate started at 405 yuan, and the spot was still at 410 yuan. The closing certificate price was 409.5 yuan, and the spot price was 415 yuan. It is found that the total number of bales bought by various gangs throughout the day is 1,560 bales, and the market price of Double Horse spot is flat, the certificate is up 2 yuan, Double Earth is up 3 yuan, Shepherd is up 1 yuan, and others are about the same as the previous day. Today, 675 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 375 pieces to Shantou, 580 pieces to Hong Kong, 190 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 95 pieces to Beihai. The amount of purchase by each gang is listed on the left: Same industry 2,295, Yunnan 100, Mainland 25, Hong Kong 50, totaling 1,560.

Japanese yarn fell in the early morning, and then rebounded in the afternoon. In fact, after days of falling sharply, it has already rebounded slightly. The market generally says that the Qingdao yarn market has increased. The morning price of 20-count Yueqin was 358 yuan, and it rebounded to 361 yuan in the afternoon. As a result, there was no major change compared with the previous day.

### Japanese Merchant Ship Encounters Fog and Hits Reef, 3,000 Pieces of Indian Cotton Lost

In the foreign cotton market, the opening price of cotton in the New York cotton market was mixed, and industry players remained cautious, waiting for developments in Washington. However, the inventory of spot goods has been decreasing day by day, and the demand from various factories has been increasing day by day. Therefore, the near-term price rose by 7 pounds, while the far-term price fell by 6-7 pounds. The forecast for India rose by more than 1 rupee compared to the previous day, and Egypt fell by more than 10 pounds. Converted to legal tender, American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose by 3 jiao per dan, Indian cotton rose by 5 jiao, and Egyptian cotton fell by 1 yuan.

The Shanghai foreign cotton trade was very quiet due to the continuous rise in overseas cotton prices, and foreign cotton was hard to find. Yesterday, it was very quiet. Only Hong Tai ordered 700 pieces of Pingguo cotton at 62 yuan per piece, and Hefeng purchased 500 pieces of White Lock at a factory price of 77 yuan. A Japanese merchant ship carrying more than 3,000 pieces of Rangoon cotton from Yangon sank off the coast of Ningbo due to fog. It is said that more than 2,000 pieces of Rangoon cotton were ordered by a certain flower shop. The previous price was 62 yuan, and the current spot price on the market is 73-74 yuan. The flower shop's decision to lose money has already reached more than 100,000 yuan in profit calculation alone. The factory prices of cotton on the market yesterday are listed below:

Raw Material Type Factory Price Including Tax

60-count Egyptian cotton high grade 104.60

Xia Sha packed flowers 80.00 Yong An Factory imported 1,000 pieces Transfer to Factory

Nantai Cang Flowers 75.25 Xin Yu Factory imported 50 bales Transfer to Factory

White Lock 77.75 He Feng Hao imported 500 pieces Spot trade

Baba Cotton 84.75 Hong Run Hao imported 300 pieces Spot trade

White Lock 77.50 Shen Xin Second imported 500 pieces Spot trade

The business of local cotton is gradually developing. Chinese factories are very healthy, which has led to a slight increase in selling prices. The flower shops, in view of the interruption of the source of local cotton, have changed to operate foreign cotton trading. Therefore, in recent days, the purchase of Indian cotton has been very lively, the quantity scheduled by the flower number has been increasing day by day, the factories are also very eager to purchase spot goods, the source of Su North is more and more, and 1,005 bales of Tongzhou flowers arrived at the terminal. The current sales of cotton are listed below.

### Securities Telephone Shares Hit New High Price - 85 Yuan -

The London Chinese Foreign Debt market prices on Monday, the eighth of this month, were generally stable with no changes. However, the British-German continued loans and British bond notes fell by half a pound, with a price of 66.5 pounds. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bonds rose by half a pound, with a price of 26 pounds. Domestic debt was suspended due to the 5-9 Memorial.

On the eighth day of the month (Monday), the London British Far East Companies stock market prices saw only the Ping Coal Mine stock rise by 9 pence, with a price of 18 shillings 3 pence. The rest remained unchanged.

The Shanghai Public Industry Exchange's stock market prices saw little change, but the overall market sentiment was good. Tram shares were outstanding, and buyers continued to demand them. Rui Rong shares saw a large amount of trading, and a new high price of 7.9 yuan was seen. Telephone shares rose sharply to 85 yuan due to rumors of great development in their business. Jardine shares were weak due to the fall in yarn prices and selling by multiple long-term holders making profits, but the closing was stable and trading was at 18.5 yuan. The opening selling price of Reclamation shares was as low as 8 yuan, but after being strongly bought up, the final transaction was 8.05 yuan.

The rubber stock market was quite strong. Although buyers offered higher prices, there were few sellers. The UK rubber raw material inventory decreased by 1,210 tons last week, which can be said to be the largest decrease in recent months. It is estimated that the current inventory is only 67,320 tons.

### Land Rubber Shares Pay Dividends

### Piece Goods Cloth Market Depressed, Speculation Disappears, Trading Sparse, Eastern Piece Goods Also Weak and Unable to Rise

Domestic Cloth

The market is declining and trading is sparse, mainly because the military transportation on the southern ports has affected current sales, and it is feared that there will be no hope of a turnaround in the short term. Since the official denial of the rumors that the customs will issue regulations on the use of counterfeit money by the customs authorities, speculators have gradually disappeared, and customers only sell but do not buy, which has led to a slump in market prices. The off-season sales were originally deserted, and most of them had a large amount, so they were unable to handle this decline, so new transactions have been in a stagnant state in recent days, and the market is also lacking in changes. Yesterday, more than a dozen packages of blue peacock fine cloth from Subbei Dongtai Taizhou Bang were sold at 14.75 yuan, and more than 20 packages of Yihe light and heavy coarse cloth were sold. The wholesale shops on the street sold 30-40 packages of coarse cloth from the Jiangsu Zhejiang inland gang, and thousands of pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, pongee, linen yarn, and printed goods. The wholesale trade in this street is the most prosperous, and they are all fashionable light-colored cloth. The printed linen yarn and linen-spun non-fading flower cloth produced by Ying Shang Lun Chang Factory are selling surprisingly well, and 40-50 boxes are sent out every day, with no surplus. After Ying Shang Yihe Factory expanded the bleaching and dyeing department, it started selling the first product, a box of Chun bleaching cloth, for 15.70 yuan 7. Yesterday, it continued to open 100 boxes of the same brand of bleaching cloth, with a price of 16.60 yuan, which was sold by the wholesale number on Muk Street. More than 100 boxes of bleached cloth, colored cloth, pongee, and striped bleach have been shipped from the Tianjin Bang in Beilu. In recent days, the southwest Sichuan Yunnan Guizhou Bang have also continued to ship large quantities of standard cloth, colored cloth, floral cloth, and satin, but new transactions are very rare.

Eastern Piece Goods

Fine cloth and fine twill are affected by weak sales and individual households continue to sell at a loss, forming a weak and unable to rise. In the morning market, the lowest sales price of Longtou fine cloth spot goods was 13.60 yuan, and then rebounded to 13.80 yuan, which was 1-1.50 jiao lower than the previous day. Fine twill is affected by sluggish sales of colored twill, and the trend is very stagnant. Yanghe twill spot goods are 13 yuan, and Baobei has dropped to 12.25 yuan. Non-industry customers and the Tianjin gang have sold out a lot, but the fellow traders in this street are still optimistic about the mentality, so although the actual sales are low, the number of transactions continues to be around 1,000 pieces.

Export

The exports on the tenth day were 190 pieces to Tianjin, 30 pieces to Yantai, 20 pieces to Xiamen, 160 pieces to Hong Kong, 25 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 35 pieces to Beihai.

### Serge and Wool - No Significant Ups and Downs

Yesterday, there were continued transactions of summer white goods, etc., which are needed for sales in the summer. Due to the environmental conditions, the demand from customers was not as strong as that of this street. Recently, only the West clothing gang had a stronger demand. Standard market prices are still mostly standing tall, while gray Serge and wool, regardless of stripes or plain, have no ups and downs due to balanced supply and demand. Both Chinese and foreign goods have considerable sales. Yesterday, ordinary Western goods gray Serge and wool were sold at 9.75 yuan per yard, the first grade of Chinese goods was 7.5 yuan, the second grade was 6.8 yuan, the first grade of Dong goods was 8 yuan, and the Henderson brand was sold at 7.25 yuan.

### Silk and Tea Shanghai Silk Reeling Industry to Go on the Market, and New Cocoons are About to Enter the Market, and Work Hard to Collect Cocoons in Guerrilla Areas, with Jiangyin Being the Most Welcomed by Manufacturers

The most urgent and important problem for the Shanghai silk industry is raw materials. According to estimates of the current situation, silk mills in Shanghai consume more than 150,000 dan of dried cocoons each year. This year, since the so-called "Central China Company" wanted to prohibit the transport of dried cocoons to Shanghai and monopolize the cocoon banks in various towns, in an attempt to monopolize, the factories in Shanghai were deeply worried. Recently, the situation has eased slightly, because the cocoon banks in the four villages outside the city are mostly controlled by guerrillas. If "Central China" formally goes down to the village to collect cocoons, it will inevitably be attacked by the guerrillas. Therefore, under the discussion of the "Central China" Japanese puppet government, it was decided to temporarily abandon the cocoon banks outside the scope of influence, and let Chinese in name go down to the village to collect cocoons, transport them to the city, and then resell them to Central China. On the one hand, it was declared that Chinese and other cocoon merchants are allowed to freely set up lines to collect cocoons without hindrance, so the remaining cocoon merchants are very active. However, the cocoons collected, I heard, must be divided equally with "Central China", some say they can be transported to Shanghai, some say they absolutely cannot, and there are many rumors.

There are currently 37 silk mills in Shanghai. If there are really no raw materials transported to Shanghai, they will inevitably be forced to stop work. All factories are aware of this, so they openly discussed that at this time it is impossible to give a definite answer on everything. The result was that it was decided to first start renting lines in the guerrilla areas, and the issue of export will be determined at that time, that is, to see the facts and act accordingly. The cocoon line owners in the four villages, who are well aware of the situation, refuse to be used by "Central China", so most of them refuse to cooperate and go to Shanghai to sign lease contracts with various factories. The factory and the line work together. Due to environmental reasons, it is feared that various obstacles will occur, so the responsibility for all assets is borne entirely by the line owner. Now I will list the general packaging and baking prices on the market.

(1) Large-scale packaging and baking: From the collection of cocoons to the boarding of Jianglun, all military police donations, taxes, transportation costs, salary of the staff of the line, meals, etc. are the responsibility of the line owner. The price of packaging and baking per dan of dried cocoons ranges from 35 yuan to more than 40 yuan.

(2) The line owner is only responsible for the cost of drying the cocoons and the costs of the workers, the miscellaneous expenses in the line, meals, etc., and all other issues are the responsibility of the customer. The price of packaging and baking per dan ranges from 20 yuan to more than 30 yuan.

Generally speaking, the lines in Jiangyin are the most popular among manufacturers, because they are close to the Yangtze River and the exports are more convenient, so the rise and fall of the packaging and baking prices must be determined according to the current environment, which is three to four times higher than before the war.

In Yixing, recently, the Chinese and Japanese armies are engaged in fierce battles, and there is no certainty about the future of cocoon collection. I am afraid that there are more dangers in other places. (Xiang)

### Foreign Silk is Extremely Popular and Shanghai Silk Sales are Active

The foreign silk market continued to rise yesterday. New York's near-term silk jumped 8 fen to open at 2.63 yuan, and the far-term silk rose 6 fen, which can be said to be extremely popular. The spot price of Japanese silk rose 7-8 fen, and Shanghai silk has not been opened for a long time. It opened yesterday at 2.46 yuan, which is equivalent to more than 1,900 yuan in Shanghai. The price of Chinese and Japanese grade A raw silk in the Lyon silk market each rose 6.5 francs, the price of grade B silk rose 2.5 francs, and the price of Guangdong silk rose 3 francs. Yokohama's spot price fell 5 yuan, and the far-term price rose 21 yuan.

The trading of the company in this port was relatively deserted, because the foreign firms limited the price, and the rise was slightly slow. The French company's route was very active. The B grade RR white factory price was 1,790 yuan, and Ren Chang, Da Chang, and Xin Fu each imported 80 dan. The sales of Ji Li, which is popular in the British and Indian markets, is also lively. It is estimated that Da Feng, Xin Da, and other foreign firms imported a total of 30 dan. The market price is rising.

On the ninth day, 373 pieces of lake silk and 50 tons of tea were transported to Hangzhou.

### Grain Prices: Local and Visiting Merchants Faced Stagnation; Flour Market Stabilized; Imported Wheat Arrived Continuously, Significantly Impacting the Market

The flour price surge has subsided, primarily because the No. 2 Flour Mill uniformly switched to a cash price of $4.55 per bag for all local merchants. Dealers in this area found the price too high, reducing their purchases, and sales in the Rongbang region remained stagnant. According to sources from the Beiyang area, the flour prices in Tianjin and Shanghai are currently comparable, but the risk of exchange rate fluctuations is deterring large-scale transportation. Mills, facing high costs and limited processing of foreign flour, see no need to compromise. Therefore, the market remains stable. The total volume of transactions for various flour brands was 35,000 to 36,000 bags. Aside from retail sales in the North and South, there was some interest from inland merchants. The price of No. 2 Flour Mill's product remained unchanged, although reports indicate slight variations in returned goods. The overall market situation has entered a state of fluctuation.

Exports: On the 10th, flour exports totaled 25,100 bags to Tianjin, 2,000 bags to Weihaiwei, and 11,300 bags to Xiamen. On the same day, 500 bags of bran were shipped to Xiamen and 400 bags to Hong Kong.

Yesterday marked the anniversary of the May 9th National Humiliation Day, and the Miscellaneous Grains Association market was closed for the day. The wheat market has been significantly affected by the dumping of foreign wheat, leading to prolonged inactivity. Mills, having access to foreign wheat, are not purchasing local wheat on the market, only fulfilling door-to-door deliveries. Recently arrived Jiangbei wheat is being sold at lower prices due to its heavy mud content. It is said that high-quality wheat delivered to mills is priced at only $6.50 to $6.60, while the market price is still one or two dimes higher.

Imported wheat continues to arrive. The "Kai Qi Cheng Li Hao" (transliterated) ship, managed by Jardine Matheson, arrived with 92,011 bags, as reported previously. The Hestralia, managed by Jardine Matheson, carrying over 7,000 tons of Australian wheat, arrived in Shanghai on the 8th and docked at Qichang Wharf in Pudong, where unloading is underway. It is also reported that the Queen Victoria, also managed by Jardine Matheson, carrying over 8,000 tons of Australian wheat, is expected to arrive tomorrow (the 11th). Additionally, the Rlauduff and Rindebak, managed by Paw Ho Foreign Firm, are carrying large quantities of wheat from Australia to Shanghai and are expected to arrive in mid-month. The exact quantities will be reported later. (Zu)

### Rice Market Remains Unstable

Domestic Rice: Yesterday, shipments from He Xia to Songjiang No. 1 and Donglun Baozi to Sutongbang totaled only 1,400 to 1,500 bags. The chaotic market situation remains unresolved. Because prices remain on the restricted line, Northern Japonica rice is not being sampled. Only Southern Japonica rice and thin rice are being traded, with prices quoted at $15. He Xia Songjiang thin rice is priced at $14.50 per load. However, since the strict price controls and fines were implemented, the restricted line has been maintained. Simultaneously, public sentiment has gradually stabilized, and purchasing power has declined. Therefore, the price of sharp rice, except for high-quality rice, which remains at $16, has decreased by a few cents. To stabilize the rice market, those in charge must take forceful measures. Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian remain scarce. Bian Yuan remains stable, with high-quality rice at $21 and market rice at $20.05. Yin Yuan has a load of Fengjing rice priced at $16.25.

Guest Xian Rice: After being absorbed by hoarders for several days, resulting in repeated price increases, large-scale transportation by guest merchants has been triggered. In the past two days, as many as 15,000 bags have been shipped from the Yangtze River by steamer. Hoarders are now taking a wait-and-see attitude, and local merchants are hesitant to continue purchasing in large quantities. Merchants are instead planning to sell off their existing stock while prices are high. As a result, the Guest Xian rice market has experienced a sudden drop of two to three dimes amidst active selling. Medium-grade rice is weakening, and high-quality rice is only down one or two dimes. The highest price quoted is still $14, with Nanjing market also quoting $14. However, sellers of exceptionally high-quality rice are unwilling to sell cheaply. Transactions have been limited due to hoarders halting their purchases, with less than 3,000 bags traded. Foreign rice is still priced at $19.10 to $19.20. International news reports vary, with the highest price reported at $20.05.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Significant Imports of Soybean Oil

Yesterday, on the occasion of the May 5th Memorial, the miscellaneous grains market was closed for one day. However, soybean oil imports were quite strong, including 1,990 bags of beans from Shi Jin and 1,210 units of soybean oil from Yantai. Shipments from Qingdao included 2,300 units of blended oil and 1,900 cans of sesame oil.

Also, soybean exports: On the 9th, 36 tons were shipped to Columbus. On the 10th, 160 bags were shipped to Xiamen and 320 bags to Hong Kong.

Egg yolk and egg white: On the 9th, 598 tons were shipped to London. On the 10th, 47 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Batch of Taikoo Granulated Sugar Transacted

Yesterday, the London telegraphic report for raw white sugar showed a slight increase in the near term, with May at 8 shillings and 5 pence. The forward market was slightly weaker, with August at 7 shillings and 4 pence and November at 6 shillings, 2 pence and 75. Dutch prices remained unchanged. Hong Kong reported an increase to HK$11.50 per bag, equivalent to $21.20 in Shanghai. Therefore, the Shanghai market is slightly firmer. The Association quoted $24 for raw white sugar, with current goods at the local warehouse up one dime to $28.40, and $28.20 at the outer warehouse. Due to continued releases from bonded warehouses, the market is weaker, with 704 bags released at $20, and goods arriving on the 13th at $20.20 for 300 bags. Dutch red sugar and local refined white sugar remained unchanged. Taikoo granulated sugar was down slightly by one to five cents, with West Warehouse's B mark at $28.10, CW mark at $27.95, CX mark at $27.80, and DY mark at $27.50 for 100 bags. HX mark was at $27.50, and H mark red sugar was at $19.50. Taikoo Company quoted HK$11.5 for B mark, HK$11.4 for CW mark, HK$11.3 for DY mark, and HK$11.2 for HX mark, with a total of 2,500 bags transacted. Domestic sugar remains weak due to slow sales, with only a few hundred bags of mixed-road foreign sugar offered at $18.20 and dozens of bags of Huizhou white sugar at $14.50.

### North-South Goods: Glutinous Rice Branches Decline

Glutinous rice branches have softened due to recent decreased sales. Merchants are hesitant to make purchases, leading to reduced bids. It is reported that ordinary goods are being offered at $137, while higher-quality goods are selling for $150, with a settled price of $140, a decrease of $10 compared to the highest price.

### Seafood: Shantou Shrimp Tails and Razor Clams, New Goods Test the Market

Shantou shrimp tails and razor clams have been inactive for a long time due to the seasonal gap. New goods from early summer have recently arrived and were sold quickly the day before yesterday. Dragon whiskers shrimp tails are priced at $140, and five pieces of Huaihe locust jerky are priced at $50. These are initial market tests, and more goods are expected to arrive soon.

### Medicinal Materials: Abalone Shells in Short Supply, Prices Expected to Rise

Abalone shells, the outer hard shell of abalone, have seen many low-quality sources since the war, with the lowest price being only $12 to $13 per picul. When in short supply, the price has risen to over $20. Recently, the market has been almost sold out. Domestic products, such as those from Qiongzhou, are usually plentiful, but transportation difficulties have increased costs due to detours through Hong Kong. Therefore, the current market price is $30.

### Coal: Henan White Coal Sold as Old Stock; Indian Coal Arrives, Over 7,000 Tons

Henan white coal business is still booming, with demand from restaurants, so the market remains stable. Yesterday, a certain firm offered Henan mixed coal at $41 per ton and lump coal at $44 per ton, ex-Pudong warehouse, with additional charges for handling. However, most of this white coal is pre-war stock from Hanyang warehouse, with a dull yellow color, and not as hard and heat-resistant as new coal.

More Indian coal has arrived in Shanghai. The Nyl adys Moller, managed by Jardine Matheson, carrying 7,080 tons of coal from Shankargarg, is expected to arrive tomorrow (the 11th).

### Metals: Narrow Iron Market Active

The metals market has been good recently due to sales in Tianjin. 200-pound American narrow iron has seen a recent resurgence, with as many as six or seven hundred boxes offered on the market. Buyers are mostly from local can factories, with some interest from Qingdao, Yantai, and Tianjin. Sales to Fujian, usually strong, have been affected by Japanese bombing, which has disrupted procurement. Overseas prices are rising (recently selling for 65 gold dollars per ton, up 3 gold dollars), so local prices are at $43 for mixed goods.

### Strike First

— Mao Lie

The military alliance between Germany and Italy is about to be signed. The process, impact, and future consequences of this event have been reported in detail by foreign news agencies, and Chinese newspapers will surely have extensive commentary. Therefore, I do not intend to discuss these aspects here, but rather to briefly share some thoughts that this matter has triggered in me.

I believe that Germany and Italy, particularly Germany, are skilled competitors. They understand the principle of "strike first, control the game; strike later, be controlled." We see that since the troubles in Central Europe, haven't they emerged victorious in every crucial change? While there are many reasons for their success, their quick decision-making and swift execution, like skilled athletes in a competition, constantly striving to be first, are undoubtedly significant factors. The formation of this military alliance, though long in the making, is now a natural culmination, reaching a certain stage. Conversely, looking at the much-publicized, seemingly imminent anti-aggression organizations, or the Anglo-French-Soviet alliance, they remain in a state of hesitant distance. We cannot help but say that, in this comparison, Germany and Italy have taken the lead.

By taking the lead, I am in control and others are guests. I can wait at ease and take what I want, while others must hastily respond, falling into my trap. Since China adopted the philosophy of "think thrice before acting," or at least "think twice," society and even government authorities have historically valued slow, circuitous, and dilatory approaches. They call it prudence and consideration, but in reality, it is often just laziness. Compared to the Westerners' courage and progress, they lag far behind. Westerners even rush to take the lead, even if it means making mistakes, saying that it is better than missing an opportunity by not acting. They truly understand the essence of taking the lead, and Germany and Italy are their representatives.

Since the start of the War of Resistance against Japan, China has finally begun to change this bad habit and has embarked on the path to victory by taking the lead. We see that the aggressor initially did not want to start a full-scale war, but only wanted to achieve its goals through coercion and temptation. China, however, resolutely resisted, forcing the aggressor to use all its resources to cope. Even now, this situation persists: the aggressor wants to maintain its existing gains and negotiate peace, while China still wants to resist to the end and expel the aggressor from its territory. China is proactive, and the aggressor is passive. The situation is clear, and China has taken the lead.

Taking the lead guarantees victory. China can certainly be confident in this, and even if it takes a long time, what does it matter!

### Sleeping Pills

— Dongfang

Before I set off, I received a letter from Teacher Xu, asking me to buy a bottle of sleeping pills from Doctor Lin and mail it to him. I hadn't seen Teacher Xu in a long time. I heard that he was very active in the guerrilla zone, holding an important position. Why would he need sleeping pills? So, I made a detour to his town, paid him a visit, and delivered the pills to him directly.

Teacher Xu was thinner than before, but his spirit was high. When he saw me, he repeatedly clasped his hands and welcomed me into the room, where we sat down in the study. A maid brought tea, and I took out the bottle of pills, presented it to him with both hands, and asked him why he needed sleeping pills. He played with the bottle's decoration, smiled gently, and said, "I have insomnia!"

Outside the window was a small courtyard, with a cluster of green bamboo against the wall and a few rockeries underneath. I remembered the many years I had spent studying and asking questions in front of this window, wandering around and achieving nothing. Teacher Xu was older, and I had grown a mustache. He asked about life on the isolated island and sighed, "Shanghai is not Shouyang Mountain after all. Vetch and ferns are just money in your pocket. When the money runs out, you get pushed out."

I was one of those who had been pushed out. Hearing Teacher Xu's words, I felt unspeakable sorrow. Teacher Xu continued:

"When the front line was critical and my hometown was in danger, I made arrangements for my family affairs, wrote a will, and vowed to live and die with my country. I asked Doctor Lin to send me a bottle of sleeping pills, and I wrote eight lines myself, saying: 'A scholar cannot be humiliated, his heart cannot die. What is the purpose of reading the classics? To achieve benevolence and take righteousness, I take this medicine here. Heaven and earth, spirits, bear witness!' All my friends knew about this. I was determined to fulfill my oath. When I heard that the National Army had retreated from the city, I grabbed the bottle and poured it down. I didn't expect that I couldn't sleep at all and could only hear my wife giggling. I knew that something was wrong, and this was a very bad joke. How could I bear the accusations of deceiving the world and stealing fame? I got up and banged my head against the wall, and fainted, but I didn't die. When I woke up, everyone was around me, some trying to comfort me, some trying to persuade me. I didn't say a word, just lay there blankly. My son said something more reasonable. He said, 'The fall of the coastal cities along the Yangtze River was expected long ago and cannot be compared to the fall of the country. Loyal and upright people like Wen Tianxiang only sacrificed their lives to serve the country when there was no turning back. Now that the War of Resistance has begun, it cannot be compared to the fall of the country.' They guarded me, and there was simply no way to die. Later, my son went to the interior to participate in the War of Resistance. Before leaving, he knelt down and asked me to let his departure be exchanged for my survival. At that time, I myself didn't really want to die. I wanted to open my eyes and see the great army counterattack and drive the invaders out. I sighed, and I had to ignore those who blamed me for not dying. Ken Weng laughed at me, saying, 'It's difficult to die throughout the ages, and it's not just Lady Xi who is heartbroken, alas!'"

"My heart may not be dead, but I have endured humiliation. The counterattack we were waiting for never comes. This torment is truly indescribable. Neither this way nor that way, looking at the shadows of the sun, listening to the sounds, the days are like years, and I can't sit or stand still. As I waited and waited, my nerves changed. I often had insomnia, I was emaciated, and my appetite was poor. I was really afraid that I would wither and die. Fang Weng's poem, 'When the royal army has pacified the Central Plains, don't forget to tell your father at the family sacrifice,' will be written for me. My wife took out the sleeping pills, and they were very effective. It's really ridiculous that they didn't kill me when I should have died, but now they are saving me in my stolen life!"

"Now I have changed again. I know that no matter what you do yourself, time doesn't seem to pass slowly. But if you wait with your hands folded, then you're anxious! Instead of waiting for the counterattack, why not do it myself! I considered myself dead at the time, but now I am reborn. I've subtracted forty years from my age. I'm still young and strong, and I can contribute to the country. Brother! I'm not older than you now, maybe even younger. I've learned to shoot, and I can send and receive wireless messages. We've driven the invaders out of here, and this is now a piece of clear land. I'm very happy now. I'm much younger in spirit, but I still can't sleep at night without these pills."

As I listened to him, I kept raising my hand to wipe the sweat from my forehead, sitting there in silence.

He let me stay for two days. When I left, he personally took me to the ship dock, held my hand, and solemnly said:

"If you can't be Yiyi and Boqi, after you go back and see your parents, come back here, definitely, I'll wait for you!"

His overly excited face was so thin that I was a little worried. I secretly prayed that these pills could sustain him forever!

### May Flowers

### Vow

— Liu Lan

Imagining myself walking alone in a paradise, or traveling on the sea; settling down in a thatched hut in an unknown land, like a hermit. This reverie often made me wander in a daze for a long time.

But the whip of reality cruelly lashes from behind, waking me from my dreams. Looking up, I am deeply surprised. How vast is the world? What is life? Is life a dream?

The sharp hook at the end of the question mark grabs hold of my mind, and I carefully search for an answer. I begin to learn, to learn how to live.

A friend said: "I'm asking for a change, come and take my magic wand!" But, to whom can I turn? Extending a hand for help, who will lead me onto the road of life?

Isn't living on the pity and sympathy of others shameful? I hesitated again. Withdrawing my hand, I take a step forward. I will rely on my own strength to walk. There will never be a lack of like-minded companions on the road to truth, but we should not shrink back, extending a pale hand to others. Tired, we fall, what does it matter? We have given our last breath to pave the way. A drop of blood is a trace in history. A complete page is made up of accumulated traces.

Throw away the gray lenses that look backward! Don't dwell on yesterday. Why grieve and regret the past? Why linger in the old courtyard, becoming a person who clings to the past?

We must learn to discard the ugly legacy of the past, hold on to today, and not let every sunset pass in a sigh. Tomorrow is a new day, a day of joy, happiness, and sunshine, and that is the vow.

### Shameless Writing Style – Records of Beneficial Reading –

— Poor Man

It is actually not easy to praise the merits of the aggressor, because often even you yourself will become more and more confused as you speak. However, our writers have always had a very good skill, that is, no matter whether there are flaws or whether it is right, just give him a praise, praise, praise. In fact, those words of praise are only a set, and there is really no way to take into account whether there are flaws or whether it is right. There should be a lot of historical materials to prove this "writing style", but what I have temporarily found is "Ping Song Lu".

"Ping Song Lu" records the process of the Yuan Dynasty's Prime Minister Bayan settling the Southern Song Dynasty, and it is a typical work of flattery. The author, Liu Minzhong, is said to be a talented writer. The four who wrote the preface, Deng Qi, Fang Hui, Du Daojian, and Zhou Ming, are probably all very good at "writing". But fortunately, I don't want to verify their lives, so I don't need to say much. But it should be especially pointed out that they are all Han Chinese. It is not wrong to regard them as writers of the "×× Newspaper" school more than 600 years ago.

Deng Qi said in his preface: "Our Holy Yuan Dynasty's Prime Minister Bayan, took Xianghuai as if picking up a mustard seed, and pacified Jiangnan as if turning his hand." He also said: "Our Holy Emperor uses benevolence and righteousness to command generals, and Prince of Huai'an uses benevolence and righteousness to command soldiers: a basket of food and a pot of slurry, the families helped each other."

Fang Hui said in his preface: "...not entering the city with a single soldier or horse, not capturing a single civilian, not plundering a single item, and this was the case wherever they went."

Du Daojian said in his preface: "...using troops in Jianghan, not fond of killing. On the day the city fell, the people were silent."

Zhou Ming said in his preface: "…leading the army again to take dozens of states in Jianghuai, heading straight to Su Xiu, the wind blowing everywhere, the soldiers not shedding blood…"

These all sound very nice, but after reading the book, I found many contradictory records, which really made people feel too bizarre: "On the dawn of Gui Chou, people were sent to Yangluo Fort to inform the generals and soldiers of Song, announcing the majesty and virtue of the dynasty. The Song generals did not surrender. Xia Huai and others lined up thousands of warships under the great river, cutting across the river, with a majestic momentum, as if they could not be approached. On Jia Yin, the father sent someone to explain the good and bad to the Song generals, and the Song generals replied: 'We have received great favors from the Great Song for many years, and we should do our best and die to repay the favor. This is the time. How can there be a reason to betray and surrender? Prepare our armor and weapons to decide: today's world of my Song, gambling on an isolated bet, winning or losing is in this one throw.'" The Prime Minister then directed the generals to advance and attack Yangluo Fort, but did not succeed all day…"

"The Song soldiers were defeated in the river, and the hearts of the people in Yangluo Fort disintegrated. Hundreds of thousands of Song soldiers were killed and injured, and the corpses floated down the river…"

"On Ding Si, the Prime Minister led his troops to Dingjia Zhou…On Ji Wei, the Prime Minister directed the generals, taught them strategies, and used cannons, bows, and crossbows and other equipment on the river bank to attack together…chasing and killing for dozens of miles, corpses floating on the river, the water turning red…"

"On Ren Wu, to Zhang Zhou. The advancing soldiers were deadlocked. …The Prime Minister summoned the generals and pointed out strategies, ordering each to prepare siege equipment, and agreeing to attack in separate ways the next day. First sending someone to shout under the city, but the people in the city did not listen. On Gui Wei, ordering the officials to write and shoot letters into the city, but they still did not listen. The Prime Minister personally supervised thousands of troops in front of the tent to the south of the city, and built many fire cannons and bows and crossbows and other equipment, attacking day and night without stopping. To Jia Shen at Si hour…it was captured, and the city was slaughtered. It turns out that 'as if picking up a mustard seed' and 'as if turning his hand' are just this here 'not surrendering' and there 'not listening' and here 'not succeeding all day' and there 'attacking day and night without stopping'. And the so-called 'not fond of killing' and 'soldiers not shedding blood' are just here 'corpses floating down the river' and there 'the water turning red'. And 'on the day the city fell, the people were silent' is just 'slaughtering the city'. In this situation, how can the army be so civilized that not even a uniformed 'rough man' and a horse ran into the city, without capturing a single civilian or robbing a single item, and the people are so lively that they prepare tea and food, with each family congratulating each other? It is really strange to the extreme.

So, did the people who wrote the preface simply not read the book carefully? That's not the case. Even if they read it carefully, they still have to write it this way. The reason is, as mentioned above, that the words of praise are just this one set. At this time, the writer is actually very pitiful, and it is considered that he has nailed himself to death with nails.

But there is still one question: Since the main purpose of this book is to flatter, why didn't the author Liu Minzhong just write that the Grand Chancellor settled the Southern Song Dynasty without moving a soldier or fighting a battle? Wouldn't that be more straightforward? But that wouldn't work either. Because in that case, not only would the historical facts be completely changed, and people wouldn't believe your account at all, but it would also deprive the protagonist of the book of his "achievements" and "might". So the writer is also very pitiful at this time, and he has also nailed himself to death with nails.

However, this is the reason for the shameless writing style!

Old Newspaper Excerpts (24)

### A Glimpse of the Miserable Life of Coolies

(Seen in the May issue of this newspaper from the Xuantong eleventh year of Qing)

The coolies kidnapped from Macau and led back to Shanghai by Director Chen from the East Ocean arrived at the port at Shenshi on the 21st, totaling 227 people. The Niu Ye Ke steamer was moored at the Wan Chang Wharf in Hongkou. During the disembarkation, all the Min and Guangdong merchants competed to watch, and there was hardly any room to stand in the crowds along the several miles from Hongkou to the Big Bridge. The magistrate and various committee members all personally visited the shore to inspect and suppress, and to check the name registration book. The so-called coolies climbed ashore one after another, with disheveled hair and dirty faces, covered in sores and emaciated bodies, pus scabs and sweat, almost unbearable to approach. Moreover, each person was wearing a purple floral cloth coat, covered in dirt and mess, no different from beggars. Yesterday, they were transported by barge to the porridge factory in the South Gate to be settled properly. Today, various committee members gathered to interrogate several people individually. They each recounted their kidnapping and various forms of persecution and abuse after boarding the ship, some crying with tears streaming down their faces, and some sobbing and unable to recognize others. According to them: "On the way from Macau to the East Ocean, four people died of illness, three jumped into the water to commit suicide, and thirty or forty people were sick but not dead. Eleven people were beaten, one of whom was already suffering from a minor illness before the beating. The doctor told the captain that this person was sick and should not be beaten, but the captain did not listen and beat him severely, causing the person to recover only after more than ten days. No attempt was made to save those who jumped into the water, and the ship continued to sail. When the sun was scorching hot, they were suffocated in the cabin and not allowed to go out, and so on."

### Prohibition of Using Trademarks Inside Shoes

Lu Xiangxiong and Sun Juxing, etc., of the shoe industry, due to the use of trademark characters printed inside the shoes, which had been used for a long time to counterfeit other brands, and because boots and shoes are discarded after being worn out, and printing characters inside would inevitably be discarded as well, which is extremely disrespectful! In the future, patterns should be used as markers instead of characters, and all members of the industry are invited to follow suit to show respect and cherishment. Magistrate Ye has already issued a public notice prohibiting it.

To be published tomorrow: Competing for grooms: Taking out the New Year's money.

### Is This the Time to Only Seek Profit?

— Li Ke

These past few days, when our fellow compatriots of the middle and lower classes in Shanghai pick up their rice bowls to eat, they can't help but sigh and say, "Eating is difficult!"

Living in Shanghai was already not easy, and now, "eating in Shanghai" is also tormenting our fellow compatriots of the middle and lower classes in Shanghai!

Logically, China's resistance against Japan is for the sake of national independence and survival. At the same time, isn't it also to improve the people's lives? The war of resistance is by no means for a select few, but for the vital interests of every person in China. Therefore, during this war of resistance, every truly patriotic compatriot should fully display the great "compatriotic love" and should not have even a trace of "profit-seeking" mentality.

If an example or metaphor is needed, then the best example and the best metaphor here would be a lonely boat on stormy seas. May I ask: Can each passenger in a lonely boat on stormy seas not help and care for each other, and instead refrain from working together to save the boat from the dangers of the storm? If, at this critical moment of life and death, someone is still so heartless as to focus solely on profiting from others, it is tantamount to killing others and killing oneself at the same time.

According to recent newspaper reports about the chaos in the rice market, it is due to deliberate manipulation by hoarders, coupled with large-scale purchases by large households, which has plunged our fellow compatriots of the middle and lower classes in Shanghai into panic. Although the Market Management Committee and the Price Evaluation Committee have secretly investigated the owners of the stored rice and reported them to the authorities for investigation and prosecution of speculation and manipulation, this "shameful event" displayed during this war of resistance is truly humiliating.

Today, as Shanghai's environment is deteriorating daily and various evil forces are watching from all sides, seeking an opportunity to launch a malicious attack on the spirit of the people of Shanghai, all our compatriots in Shanghai, regardless of class, should work together in harmony, holding hands without revealing any gaps, lest we give villains the convenience to attack.

Now, to focus on profiting from one's own compatriots is tantamount to being disloyal to the country, undermining the war of resistance, and sucking the blood of one's own compatriots! Here, I not only hope that the hoarders will have a change of heart and refrain from speculation and manipulation, but also sincerely advise all those who want to "get rich" by taking advantage of the war of resistance: Now is not the time to "only seek profit"!

### The Demolition Wave in Qingyu Lane

— Fei Yun

Landlord Sets 15th as Deadline to Move Out; Tenants Request Mediation from All Parties

Since Shanghai became an "isolated island," the concessions have practically turned into a "pleasure haven," where people eat, drink, and make merry, leaving the war far behind. Despite the rising cost of living and landlords taking advantage of the situation, Shanghainese still strut around dance halls, movie theaters, and brightly lit gambling dens.

But behind this decadent lifestyle, we can still see many heroic struggles. Seeing these facts, we can't help but feel that human nature is often two-sided, one side being supremely noble and the other being bottomlessly depraved!

For example, these past two days, due to the issue of demolition and reconstruction, more than three thousand tenants are engaged in a struggle representing Shanghai tenants against landlords. This struggle seems to be expanding day by day, and up to now, the problem has only become more serious and more acute.

Yesterday, I made a special visit to the scene of the incident, which is the well-known Qingyu Lane on New Chongqing Road. There are a total of six alleys there, with houses of one-story, two-story, and three-story buildings. Because they are old houses, the rent is of course much cheaper than the current rent. Precisely because it is too cheap, the landlord, Shanghai Women's Bank, is pressuring the tenants of Qingyu Lane to move out. Although the tenants had sued the Women's Bank, the tenants lost the case.

As soon as you approach the intersection of New Chongqing Road and Mendeland Road, you can see the bamboo fences at the entrance of Qingyu Lane. What a shocking sight! Before houses are demolished in Shanghai, fences must be erected. Therefore, the fence is like an elegy of aesthetic education. I patrolled back and forth on New Chongqing Road and saw that several shops along the road were still calmly continuing their business. On the surface, it didn't seem like a tragedy of three thousand people being displaced was about to happen here.

However, as soon as I went inside and talked to a friend, I realized that the anxious emotions of all the tenants were increasing day by day. The Women's Bank's final order to forcibly demolish the houses, cut the lines, and cut off the water could be issued at any moment. This is such a big threat to the more than three thousand tenants living in Qingyu Lane!

I asked my friend, "How is the mediation going outside?"

That friend said angrily:

"They said they would give a reply on the 15th. If it succeeds, it will be on the 15th. If it doesn't, I'm afraid they will tear off the roofs, cut off the water, and cut off the electric wires!"

"Isn't the landlord willing to compromise at all?" I asked.

"Of course not! We first said we would wait until the war was over, but they refused. Then we said we would wait a year, half a year, and finally even said we would wait three more months, but they wouldn't even wait half a day! If there were no war, we might be able to find another way. But now in Shanghai, where do you think more than three thousand tenants can move to?"

This struggle is still ongoing. We hope that the concession authorities and the mediators can give them some help.

It is said that after the houses in Qingyu Lane are rebuilt, they are planned to be renamed "Shuntian Village," with sanitary facilities. Each house will cost from 5,000 to 8,500 yuan, with ten years of rent, payable in installments. According to this calculation, the landlord will immediately earn hundreds of thousands of yuan. It seems to be just a matter of lifting a hand.

However, we believe that during the national war of resistance, the landlord should also put themselves in the shoes of the three thousand tenants. If you lived in Qingyu Lane, what would you do?

In yesterday's article "Refugee Products Exhibition," Zhang Xiaoshi's painting exhibition was mistakenly written as "Wu" Xiaoshi. This is hereby corrected. — Fei Yun

### Dark Market Prices Soar (Benefit Sale for Donations)

— Ma Ge

### Be Careful of Protection Money

Yesterday, I received a letter from Mr. Zang Huanchun. The original text was too long, so I have excerpted it as follows: "Last night (the 5th) at 9:30 PM, I was traveling east on Singapore Road in a rickshaw because of business. Near Jiaozhou Road, the streetlights were damaged, and it was very dark nearby. As I approached a teahouse, suddenly more than ten people stood in the middle of the road, blocking the way. Several others crashed into the rickshaw. At that time, one person rolled up his trouser leg and claimed that his pants had been torn by the rickshaw. The others also blocked the rickshaw and insisted on compensation. I had no way to escape, and there was no police post in the area, so I had to pay the full amount. I am now requesting that your newspaper publish this incident to warn pedestrians."

### Suzhou People Braid Their Hair

— Fo

Suzhou people are known for their gentleness. They are good at eloquence but not good at fighting. Therefore, there is a saying, "Better to argue with a Suzhou person than to chat with a Ningbo person," because Ningbo people speak very bluntly.

But Suzhou people sometimes have to fight. Their art of fighting is to first braid their hair, to make a show of force to subdue the opponent. If the opponent is determined not to yield, the result may become real.

But Suzhou people are still Suzhou people. They only braid their hair and are unwilling to fight. Ningbo people are really tough guys. After three "damn you"s, they will draw out their fists to fight.

But are there not many Suzhou people in the international arena?

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 9: Bearing Grief and Suffering, Tears Sprinkle in All Directions; Practicing Frugality and Diligence, Ten Acres of Land

There was a matter where Mrs. Sulia rewarded Jin Danyun with 5,000 U.S. dollars, but Jin Danyun was unwilling to accept it. But this reward was public, and Mrs. Sulia insisted on giving it to her. Jin Danyun then sought instructions from the Foreign Affairs Committee, which ordered that Jin Danyun could receive it. After Danyun received it, she donated the money in her father's name to a scholarship fund to help the children of veterans who were unable to attend school. Therefore, everyone praised Jin Danyun endlessly, and even Mrs. Sulia respected her even more. This time, when Jin Danyun and Lin Jiancheng got married, Mrs. Sulia wanted to give her a big gift. But if she gave her money, she would never accept it, and giving her money would also seem disrespectful. Therefore, Mrs. Sulia knew that they were going on a honeymoon trip after their wedding, so she wanted to give them a family travel car, the so-called mobile home. Although this family rental company had not yet opened, many car models had already been sent. Mrs. Sulia wanted to choose the most suitable, best-equipped, and most suitable car for a honeymoon trip to give to Jin Danyun as a dowry. But Chu Jin Danyun still refused to accept it. She said, "We really don't need this kind of car, because both Lin Jiancheng and I have jobs and can't always go out to travel. Even if we occasionally go out, our travels are job-related and don't allow us to go out and play freely. After we get married, we both have a vacation. We originally wanted to go out to travel and play. We can also try the convenience of this family travel car. But it's only for a month. We still want to form a fixed small family after that. Now, for that kind of car, as a rental or for testing purposes, we will use it for a month, but we would never dare to accept it as a gift." Mrs. Sulia had to give up when she saw that she would not accept it. At this moment, Jin Danyun could not delay any longer and hurried back to Shanghai. Let's talk about Zhu Airen accompanying the He sisters to Freedom Village. Zhu Laoyuan, the village chief of Zhu, had already known in advance that his granddaughter Airen would bring her two classmates to this place today, so he was waiting at home. In addition, there was Zhu Airen's mother, Mrs. Zhu, and Zhu Airen's elder sister, Zhu Aiqun, who were also at home. This Freedom Village is a new village, which is somewhat different from Anle Town. Because although Anle Town has gradually improved in recent years, many places have lost their original appearance. Unlike Freedom Village, which is completely newly formed, it has a new atmosphere.

### "China Electric" War of Resistance Film "Bloodshed in an Isolated City" Completely Filmed

— Hui Cun

Premiering in Chongqing from May 5th

Prelude to Victory

Since the Central Film Studio moved to Chongqing, the limitations of material conditions have made it impossible to start filming several planned films. However, in terms of newsreels, "The Shanghai Front," "The Eastern Battlefield," "The Active Western Front," and "The Ninth Month of the War of Resistance" have been completed one after another. Problems such as electrical sets and indoor locations, which were previously considered difficult, were not solved until last summer, and formal filming work began at that time.

The first production planned by China Electric is the war of resistance newsreel "Bloodshed in an Isolated City." Since the film began production last year, it was suspended due to material problems. It was not until recently that the entire film was completed. The film tells the heroic story of General Yao Ziqing's defense of Baoshan City. The actors, such as Bo Sen, Bai Yun, and Bao Shi, have all received university education. Although they are not veteran superstars and may not be very skilled in performing on the screen, their enthusiasm and efforts have made the film exceptionally colorful.

Also completed at the same time as "Bloodshed in an Isolated City" is "Prelude to Victory." This film is a war of resistance newsreel, so it is classified as Volume 5 of the "Documentary of the War of Resistance Against Japan." In this film, there are real scenes of the "Fifth Anniversary of the New Life Movement," Chairman Chiang's instructions to women compatriots, Ms. Soong Mei-ling's opinions on women's donations, and the heroic posture of our Northwest cavalry attacking and the scenes of the Japanese fleeing in embarrassment. The entire film is full of scenes that make people feel extremely excited.

Now, these two completed war of resistance films have begun premiering simultaneously at the "Xinchuan," "Guotai," and "Wei Yi" theaters in Chongqing from May 5th.

### Movie Theaters Sprout Like Bamboo Shoots After Rain

— (Le Tian)

Five Are Under Construction; Four Are in Negotiations

Shanghai can be considered a paradise and a hell, with extreme disparity between happiness and suffering. It is truly unbelievable. Nearly five million residents have crowded the isolated island to the brim. All kinds of businesses are three times more profitable. Entertainment venues are full day and night. Many entertainment merchants are happy to be making money. It is said that there are five more movie theaters that are being actively built and will open one after another in the fall. The locations of these five are: (1) at the intersection of Maite Hesi Tuo Road and Aiwenni Road; (2) near Jing'an Temple on Maite Hesi Tuo Road; (3) Jing'an Temple; (4) near Jinmen Grand Theater on Fuxu Road; (5) Beidang Road near Xujiahui. The names of those few have not yet been decided. There are also four others who are difficult to realize because there is no suitable location at the moment.

### Ji Gaosheng Lin and Gao Shishou

— Ni Qiuping

Since Yang Xiaolou's death, everyone in the opera world has said that there is no martial arts opera to watch. This seems reasonable, but if no one encourages the younger generation, then it is also something that should not be done. Therefore, if we discover outstanding talents, we should promote them. It seems more meaningful than those who are simply there to cheer them on.

I am now introducing to you Gao Shenglin from the fourth class of Fu Liancheng. He is the son of the famous actor Gao Qingkui. It goes without saying that he has been practicing since he was a child. After graduating from Fu Liancheng, he also studied with Yang Xiaolou. Xiaolou's niece is married to Shenglin. (Xiaolou's son-in-law is Liu Yanfang, and Yanfang is Shenglin's father-in-law). Because of the family relationship and Shenglin's eagerness to learn, Xiaolou looked at Shenglin with different eyes. Although it was not for a few years, he actually learned a lot of real skills. In the last few days of Xiaolou's life, Shenglin never left the Yang family, and their relationship was very close. Speaking of Shenglin returning to Shanghai, we also have to look at him with a new perspective. I will first report the repertoire for the first five days. The first day is "Changban Slope," the second day is "Picking the Huaishai," the third day is "Jizhou City," the fourth day is "Evil Tiger Village," and the fifth day is "Heroic Righteousness." After reading this, the readers may believe that I am not bragging but telling the truth.

There is also his younger brother, who is only twenty-one years old, four years younger than his older brother. He is called Gao Shishou. Just by looking at the name, you know that he is from the fifth class of Fu Liancheng. His skills are also amazing. "Flower Butterfly," "Four Heroes Village," "Jiepai Pass," etc. are all his masterpieces. The two of them are almost always in the same play this time, although Zhang Lianting is brought along (i.e., following Shenglin to Shanghai). Although Shishou has just passed his coming-of-age ceremony, he is already good at socializing and speaks very pleasantly. He looks very dignified. If you didn't say it was Gao Shishou, who would know that he has so many good skills? (Benefit Sale for Donations)

### Prelude to "Demon of Desire"

— Yin Qiu

"Demon of Desire," written by the world-renowned Russian writer Tolstoy, originally named "The Power of Darkness," has been performed in Shanghai by various theater groups such as Zhonglv, Amateur, and Zhongfa. Because of its tight plot and its pinpricking of the dark side of Chinese society, it has been warmly welcomed by audiences everywhere.

Because it is an immortal masterpiece containing a realistic story that satirizes the current social order and rectifies morality, Mr. Yue Feng, the famous director of Xinhua Company, decided to adapt the play again and bring it to the screen.

On the screen, "Demon of Desire" is of course more realistic and tense than the stage play. At the same time, for the audience who have seen the "Demon of Desire" drama, they are eager to know what happened after Li Qi suffered from the pain and accusations of conscience after repenting after the play was unable to continue being performed on stage. Director Yue also gives each audience a very satisfactory answer here.

In the "Demon of Desire" on the screen, the distribution of actors is suitable for each person's character. This is a decision that Yue Feng made after several days and nights of research.

Shan Meixi plays the heartless, cowardly, and contradictory farmhand Li Qi. This is the most difficult role to play, but Meixi plays it appropriately, which is commendable. The romantic, vicious, murderous, and infanticidal young woman Hua Yueying is played by Lu Luming. Tan Ying plays Zhang Xiaojin in this play. Her role is the most suitable. A vivid Xiaojin seems to be exposed in front of our eyes. The newcomer Li plays the little girl Wang who was given birth by Li Qi and was abandoned. When she was born by Li Qi, her pitiful expression caused the audience to shed tears of sympathy. Others include He Jianfei as the eccentric Zhang Yubian, Yan Fei as the realistic and cunning Li Hongshi, Wang Guilin as the loyal and honest Li Dashun, Tang Jie as Hu Dayu, Wang Lingling as Zhang Xiaoyin, Tian Taixuan as Wang's mother, Liu Jiqun as Chen Laoer, and You Guangzhao as Chen's nephew, who all fit their identities.

"Demon of Desire," "Demon of Desire" on the screen, can be said to be a success in all aspects. It will be released in the Jincheng Grand Theater soon.

### Xu Yunhui's Snow in June

— Xi Tong

What I admire most is the beginning of the Execution of E'e scene when I watched the Huxhe Amateur Opera Troupe perform "Snow in June" a few times ago.

Xu, a amateur operatic performer, played Dou E. In the "Visiting Prison" scene, Dou E had an ordinary face and ordinary clothes, just like the blue-clothed dress of an ordinary poor woman. However, at the beginning of the "Execution of E'e" scene, it was completely different. At the beginning, the gongs and drums were beating tightly, although it was said that Dou E had the opportunity to change clothes, the atmosphere was particularly tense. When the curtain was lifted, two executioners suddenly grabbed Dou E on stage. One of the executioners on the right was very wonderful, with fierce eyebrows, a murderous face, and a pheasant feather inserted in his helmet, revealing his fleshy and fat chest, and showing off his prestige with his knife, helping to create a lot of realistic atmosphere. I was very surprised by the success of this fat executioner. When I inquired, I learned that he was the cross-dressing of Mr. Li Qin Xian. No wonder he played so well!

Bao E wore red clothes, her hands were tied behind her back, and a white flag was inserted behind her. Bao E's face was painted with greasepaint and black ink strips, with her eyes closed and her head lowered. She took a few steps, and after a while, she opened her eyes again. At this time, everyone in the audience held their breath and did not make a sound, giving her endless sympathy. The people under the stage and the people on the stage became one, and Bao E's pain was the pain of the crowd. We really think about E'e. She was probably already stunned at this time. Look, she couldn't even say the words completely! She weakly raised her head slightly and said the word "up," then said the word "sky," and then squeezed out the word "no way" from her seams. In this way, the sadness and joy increased! These four words are enough, and the following "Entering the Door to the Earth" and other singing sentences are not necessary! These four words are worth a large section of singing sentences and have a touch of blood. In this situation, these four words have the power of a thousand pounds. Otherwise, how could they win the applause of the whole audience!

This is a realm that is not easy to obtain, where the audience and the performer become one and blend together seamlessly. If it weren't for Ms. Xu's usual efforts, how could she have achieved such an achievement!

So I said that when I watched "Snow in June," what I admired most was the beginning of the Execution of E'e scene.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The Brutal Behavior of Warlords Massacring Actors

Chu Yupu was originally from Jining, Shandong. His family was poor. His older brother, named Yu Feng, was ten years older than him. Yupu did not have good habits since he was a child. When he was ten years old, he followed some bandits and blindly caused murder cases in Shandong Province. He could not gain a foothold, so he fled to Xuzhou in Jiangsu Province. Later, his reputation became greater and greater, and the government arrested him very tightly. He had no choice but to disband his gang and hide alone in the Qujia Weizi in the north of the city. A member of the Zhao clan, named Zhao Yaoyun, kept him at home and treated him very kindly. In the second year of the Republic of China, Leng Yu served as the commander of the Third Division and was stationed in Xuzhou. His method of suppressing bandits was to use both kindness and power. Anyone who could repent and rehabilitate could be recruited. Chu Yupu was also a well-known bandit leader at the time, so he and Chao Pan, a monk (also a giant bandit), both turned over a new leaf that year and were appointed as battalion commanders by Leng. At that time, Zhang Zongchang served as a regimental commander, and Fang Zhenwu served as a battalion commander of the supply and transportation battalion. Later, Zhang, Chu, and Fang developed a close relationship, which started from that time. At this time, Chu suddenly met a prostitute named Wang Xiangting, and the two became very close. Unexpectedly, in the second revolution, Leng's army was defeated by Feng Guozhang and retreated to Jiangning, where it had already collapsed. At this time, Chu Yupufu was incorporated by Feng Du, and the General with Long Legs was also appointed as the regimental commander of the General School Regiment. Both of them often lived in Yuling. However, they were not from the military and were often discriminated against. In addition, they spent money excessively and made losses, so they both left Nanjing and went to Zhang Zuolin outside the Guan. Chu thought that Xuzhou was his second hometown. One was to visit Zhao Yaoyun, the benefactor who had saved his life (actually, he was harboring him), and the other was to visit his old lover Wang Xiangting. Who knew that Ms. Wang, although a prostitute, was extremely generous. As soon as she heard that Chu was going to the Guan to seek development, she immediately exchanged all her jewelry for five or six hundred yuan and presented it to Lao Chu with both hands as travel expenses. The remaining money could be used for social expenses. Therefore, later, as soon as Zhang Zuolin entered the Guan, Lao Chu became a brigade commander under Zhang Zongchang. When the General with Long Legs was stationed in Xuzhou in the name of the commander of the bandit suppression in the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, the gratitude and intimacy between Chu and Wang Xiangting reached their peak. In less than two years, Zhang and Chu both became strange officials. These rough people also knew how to repay kindness, so they first invited a Zhao village leader (Yaoyun) who knew nothing about literature to the Tianjin Governor's Office to serve as the chief counselor. The Zhao family originally had a large population. When they all went to Tianjin together, all the big and small ones were given official positions. At that time, the eight departments of the Governor's Office and the troops led by Lao Chu all had members of the Zhao clan stationed among them. For a time, there was a popular saying of Zhao Banlv. From this, it can be seen that Chu treated the Zhao clan well. — (7) —
