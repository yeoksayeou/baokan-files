Editorial

### Japan's Inferior Strategy

Regarding the Sino-Japanese War, it is now necessary to review the overall situation. The issue is not merely the battles between the two armies in Hunan and Jiangxi, and the military value of their advances and retreats.

Concerning the overall situation, two points must be clarified first: If China were to abandon resistance against Japan today, after twenty-eight months, Japan would indeed have penetrated deeply, and China would be defeated. However, if China continues its resistance, it is in the early stages of turning defeat into victory, moving closer to final victory. Therefore, President Chiang's recent proclamation to the military and civilians clearly demonstrates confidence in achieving victory while avoiding complacency, and encourages them to endure hardship and sacrifice, with benevolence overflowing in his words. This is what pleases the Chinese military and civilians. This is one aspect. As for Japan's aggression against China, after twenty-eight months of experience and lessons, it has indeed abandoned its extravagant hope of conquering by force, and has realized that military aggression cannot be sustained. From now on, the situation will deteriorate daily, and all its weaknesses, both domestic and foreign, will be exposed more and more, and will become increasingly unfavorable. How could it not know that a sudden change of course, withdrawing its troops eastward, preserving its remaining strength, would still be enough to be a regional power, and that reconciliation with China would be the best strategy? However, lacking a prime minister with the魄力to reverse the situation, and lacking loyal and honest opinion leaders to stabilize public sentiment, it has adopted an inferior strategy. An inferior strategy is one that exhausts its resources internally and tires its troops externally. Internally, it binds its people like piled firewood, while placing itself on top of it. Externally, it uses coercion and deception to manipulate puppets, seeking to win through deception what it cannot win through force, and to achieve through deception what it cannot achieve through force. In reality, within the occupied areas and during the occupation period, what cannot it obtain? What is obtained is not enough to deceive the world; believing it can deceive is self-deception. Self-deception and self-misdirection are why it is called an inferior strategy. This is another aspect. Such is the current situation of both China and Japan.

Considering the future development and the final outcome from today's perspective, we believe that it can at least be asserted that Japan's aggression will ultimately fail. From today until the end, the development may be a straight line or may involve twists and turns; this cannot be predicted. However, it can be said that if both sides' authorities can maintain their resolve and determination, there will be fewer twists and turns, and less unnecessary loss of spirit, material, and time. On the Chinese side, it goes without saying that resistance will not be abandoned until national sovereignty and territory are fully restored, and the freedom of the nation and its political diplomacy are ensured. As for the distance between the initial stage of turning defeat into victory and the final confirmation of victory, who does not earnestly wish to shorten it to the minimum? However, it is necessary to proceed step by step, with solid and steady progress. If one is driven by impatience, seeking victory and speed, it is most likely to increase unnecessary twists and turns, which should be avoided. For example, in the past week, frequent reports of victories from the front have been met with great joy. However, how to retake Wuhan cannot be achieved solely by relying on one surge of momentum but requires careful planning. In short, the focus from now on should be on gradually achieving victory in every battle, not seeking quick victories, as this is the way to ensure a straight-line development.

On the Japanese side, it is not yet possible to discuss this. Judging from Japan's strained efforts to conceal its defeat after the recent battles in Hunan and Jiangxi, it can be seen that Japan is not only politically self-deceptive but also has lost its minimum level of confidence in military affairs. How can it be said that it has lost confidence? Those with confidence regard victory and defeat as commonplace, seeking victory without concealing defeat. Those who conceal defeat seek to cover up all weaknesses. How can it be said that it conceals defeat? According to war reports from the Chinese side, the Japanese army feigned an attack in mid-September, launched a full-scale attack in late September, and by the beginning of this month, the Chinese army gradually gained the upper hand, launching a full-scale counterattack, capturing Yecheng on the 5th and Xiushui on the 10th, and subsequently making progress, restoring the battle lines of late September and surpassing them. There is no doubt about the victory in the battle. However, the Japanese side issued a war report on the 10th of this month, totaling two thousand words, claiming a great victory. Leaving aside the exaggerated and false rhetoric, the first section described the "Dongting Lake Forced Landing Unit" and reported up to September 29th, the second section described the "Southward Advancing Unit" and reported up to September 30th, the third section described the "Pingjiang Capture Unit" and reported up to September 28th, the fourth section described the "Tongcheng Southward Unit" and also reported up to September 29th, and the fifth section described the "Jiuling Mountain Range Unit" without specifying the date. The conclusion stated, "Leisurely absorbing the enemy's attack to conserve our strength." The war report was issued on the 10th of this month but did not mention a single word about the events within the past ten days, concealing the defeat by saying "Leisurely absorbing the enemy's attack." Comparing the dates of the reports from both sides, there is no doubt about the Japanese defeat.

The overall situation of the Chinese war, the final victory or defeat, has its irresistible conditions, which will not be elaborated on here. As for the battles in Hunan and Jiangxi, although China won and Japan lost, they were not the main battles that determined the victory or defeat of China and Japan. Why, then, does Japan conceal it so deeply? The general reason is nothing more than to shut off the ears and eyes of its military and civilians, in the hope of勉强maintaining its declining morale and public sentiment. There is also a special reason, which is to continue its deception in the occupied areas. Consider the main arguments of its deception, which are two: first, that China is no longer capable of resisting, and second, that Japan will definitely withdraw its troops. The former aims to make the Chinese people in the occupied areas despair of the National Government and to falsely accuse the National Government of being a source of resentment. The latter aims to use "empty promises" to disarm China's resistance and to maintain absolute control over China, which has no national defense, by stationing only a small number of troops in certain military strongholds. With this deception, it seeks to replace victory with deception, to replace victory with deceit, and to replace war with deceit! Now, China has won a great victory in Hunan and Jiangxi, and the claim that "China is no longer capable of resisting" is self-defeating. If Japan does not conceal its defeat, it will have no way to continue its deception, and it has no choice but to conceal it. If it dares not even conceal a truly undeniable defeat, can it be said that it dares to suddenly change its course or resolutely withdraw its troops? Changing course and withdrawing troops are Japan's best strategy and also the way to ensure a straight-line development. However, Japan is adopting an inferior strategy and will unnecessarily waste its spiritual strength, material resources, and time.

### Chamberlain's Statement Insists on Original Stance, Rejects Hitler's Offer of Peace, Must Correct the Acts of Aggression Against Poland and Czechoslovakia, Acknowledging the Results of Aggression Will Damage Britain's Reputation

London - Prime Minister Chamberlain recently delivered a speech in the House of Commons, explaining his attitude towards the peace proposals made by German leader Hitler, stating, "These proposals are based on acknowledging the results of conquest and his right to dispose of the conquered. If Britain were to accept them, it would inevitably damage its honor and abandon our long-held principle that international disputes should be resolved through negotiations and not through the use of force. In short, even if Germany were to agree to correct its misdeeds in Poland and Czechoslovakia as a prerequisite, the promises that the current government of that country can provide cannot be considered a sufficient guarantee for the future of the situation. What we require is action, not empty words. If Germany refuses to provide adequate guarantees, we will only fulfill our obligations to the end." (Havas News Agency, 12th)

Chamberlain Enumerates Hitler's Crimes, After Exhausting Military Force, He Talks About Peace Again, Difficult to Gain Trust Due to Contradictory Actions

London - Prime Minister Chamberlain recently delivered a speech in the House of Commons this afternoon, explaining his attitude towards the peace proposals made by German leader Hitler, stating, "When I reported the establishment of an agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union last week, I stated that Germany might put forward peace proposals, and that after these proposals were put forward, we would consider them in consultation with the governments of the self-governing dominions and France, taking into account the opinions previously expressed. Later, German leader Hitler indeed delivered a speech on the 6th of this month, and I myself immediately followed the planned steps, consulting the opinions of the self-governing dominions and the French government, and now I can explain the government's position. However, it is particularly important to first trace the background of these proposals." Recalling the end of August, the British government was negotiating with the German government on the Polish issue, at which time the situation was clearly critical, but if matters intentionally stimulating emotions could be avoided, a peaceful solution might not be impossible to obtain. We deeply knew that the German government had the power to urge its friends in the Free City of Danzig to ease the tense situation in order to conduct negotiations. Hitler had also stated that once the Polish issue was resolved, he would be willing to promote relations with Britain. We then told him that if Germany were to adopt coercive measures, Britain's obligations to the Polish nation would have to be implemented. Unfortunately, the British government's efforts to avoid the scourge of war were all in vain. This has already been known to the world. US President Roosevelt, King Leopold III of Belgium, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and Pope Pius XII also all called for peace in August of this year, but all were ineffective. Hitler's determination to use force against Poland was already obvious. Even if he was willing to establish an understanding with Britain, his actions of attacking Poland would not be delayed as a result. Finally, he violated all agreements and brazenly invaded the country. At this point, Hitler again arrogantly spoke of fulfilling agreements, which is certainly strange. To know that his use of force to satisfy his desires has already caused countless Poles and Germans to die in vain. Now, after completing the invasion, he puts forward peace proposals. We cannot help but ask, after Germany infringed upon the rights of Czechoslovakia not long ago, and then committed this great crime against humanity, do Hitler's proposals really contain any intention of making amends? Once we think deeply, we cannot help but feel disappointed. In reality, Hitler has done everything possible to humiliate Poland and its leaders. He regards part of Poland's land as being in Germany's interests, not allowing others to interfere, and wants to dispose of it according to his own interests. In short, the final disposition of Poland's territory and the issue of the country's restoration can only be resolved by Germany and the Soviet Union. The proposals he puts forward are based on acknowledging the results of conquest and his right to dispose of the conquered. If Britain were to accept them, it would inevitably damage its honor and abandon the principle that international disputes must be resolved through negotiations and not through the use of force. (The legislators cheered loudly and for a long time.) In his speech, Hitler also provided various guarantees to neighboring countries, but these countries deeply know that these guarantees have no value worth paying attention to compared with the guarantees he has provided in the past. Hitler has elaborated in great detail on the policies he is pursuing and the beliefs he holds, which are also not worth our attention. He has repeatedly spoken of the right to national self-determination, and as a result, he has incorporated millions of Czechs and Poles into Germany. He has also repeatedly attacked Bolshevism, and as a result, he has concluded an agreement with the Soviet Union. From this, it can be seen that his acts of betrayal are commonplace. In a word, based on past experience, we can no longer trust the promises provided by the current German government. The policy we are pursuing is not to exclude Germany from Europe, nor to exclude a Germany that is willing to interact with other countries in friendship from Europe. On the contrary, we firmly believe that if we want to effectively address the source of chaos in the world, we must take into account the legitimate demands and needs of all countries, but we also believe that all peaceful solutions cannot be expected to be established unless they come from negotiated agreements. (Havas News Agency, 12th)

He (the Prime Minister) informed his country's neighbors of the new assurances given by Hitler, so that they could check the same assurances Hitler had given in the past and know what value they had. Hitler has repeatedly announced Greater Germanism, and now he still incorporates millions of Polish and Czech people into the German Reich. Although he has repeatedly denounced Bolshevism, he still concludes an agreement with the Soviet Union. His words and deeds are so inconsistent that who can believe that he will suddenly reverse his policy? Therefore, based on our past experience, we can no longer trust the words issued by the current German government without strong evidence. (The crowd cheered.) Our policy is not to reject Germany from occupying a legitimate position in Europe, but this Germany must be a country that coexists with other countries in harmony and trust. We also believe that unless attention is paid to the legitimate demands and needs of all countries, an effective way to remedy the world's ailments cannot be found. The opportunity for a new peaceful resolution may come in the future, but if it is not resolved through negotiations and treaties, the hope for the future is slim. Our war is for no other reason than to defend freedom. Today, not only is the freedom of small countries in danger, but also the peaceful existence of all freedom-loving countries, whether large or small, including the self-governing dominions, India, the rest of the empire, and France, is in imminent danger. (The crowd cheered.) Looking to the future, we will see that all aspects of human thought and action will leave deep traces of change. All nations will each have their due responsibilities. The Prime Minister continued to say that the government deeply knows that in modern wars between major powers, both the winning and losing sides must love cruel losses. However, if they show submission to wrong acts, they will inevitably destroy all hope and destroy all the value of life. This value of life has been a symbol and expectation of human progress for many centuries. We do not seek to obtain significant benefits from the German people who violate their self-esteem, and we have no desires. We are not only determined to win, but we also have a goal beyond this, which is to lay a better foundation for the international system and to make war not an unavoidable event for future generations. (The crowd cheered.) Now I dare to say that all the nations of Europe, including Germany, yearn for peace, because peace can enable people to live and work in peace, without fear, and to concentrate on the development of culture, the pursuit of doctrines, and the increase of material prosperity. However, the peace we seek must be a truly stable peace, not an uneasy peace that is disturbed by times of panic and threats. At present, the obstacle to this kind of peace is the German government, and there is no other, because they have repeatedly taken aggressive actions, causing unrest throughout Europe and making all their neighbors feel insecure. He is now happy to say that the opinions of the British and French governments are completely in agreement. (The crowd cheered.) The Prime Minister then recounted the essence of French Prime Minister Daladier's speech, and the whole audience cheered loudly. He continued to say that now, taking advantage of the visit of the Polish Foreign Minister to England, he has consulted with the Polish government, and he feels that the opinions between England and Poland are completely the same, which is very gratifying. The Prime Minister finally summarized the government's attitude, saying that Hitler rejected all peace proposals before conquering Poland, and now he suddenly puts forward peace conditions. England and France find it difficult to accept them. The German government must provide sincere proof of its guarantees and undertakings, otherwise we can only persevere to the end. The Soviet, French, Polish, Argentine, Brazilian, Chinese, Spanish, and Egyptian ambassadors, as well as the ministers of the Scandinavian countries, Latvia, the Netherlands, Romania, and Nepal, were all present to listen today. Polish Foreign Minister Chaleski also sat quietly in the VIP seats. (Reuters, 12th)

A Czech Government Said to Be Established in England

London - According to unofficial sources, a new Czech government has already been established. (Havas News Agency, 11th)

The Newly Appointed Italian Ambassador Arrives in England to Take Office

Rome - It is reported that the newly appointed Italian Ambassador to England, Mastiani, set off for London today to take office. It is expected that Mr. Ba will briefly present Italy's views on peace proposals and convening an international conference. (Reuters, 12th)

German Newspaper Views

Berlin - The German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, the "German Foreign Political Communications," commented on French Prime Minister Daladier's speech, denying Germany's desire to dominate Europe and Germany's threats to France. It went on to say that Daladier mentioned Czechoslovakia and Poland, but these countries are centers of turmoil and endanger Germany's security. Germany must eliminate this threat with a permanent solution. The Frankfurter Zeitung stated that Daladier's speech and Hitler's proposals have the possibility of incorporating both and do not necessarily have fundamental conflicts. The French Prime Minister must carefully study Hitler's peace proposals and should be able to discover a lasting peace based on political realities. Daladier, as the French Prime Minister, has the power to decide on war and peace, but he must clearly express what the decision is, war or peace, and must not be ambiguous. (Haitong Telegraph, 12th)

### Amidst Tense Atmosphere: Finland and Soviet Union in Negotiations; Border Troops of Both Countries Confront Each Other; Soviet Union Has Proposed Four Demands

Danzig: According to news received here today, Finland is preparing for an emergency situation and has mobilized 100,000 people. The current state of Finland is vastly different from 1918, as it now possesses a significant number of aircraft and munitions. Finnish civilians are currently setting up obstacles and defensive works on main roads and in the suburbs to obstruct tanks. The government here has learned that the Soviet Union has proposed four things to Finland: (1) the cession of several small islands in the Gulf of Finland to the Soviet Union; (2) the conclusion of a military alliance between Finland and the Soviet Union, but with Soviet troops not stationed within Finnish territory; (3) the establishment of new economic and political ties; and (4) the complete withdrawal of Germans from Finnish territory. Yesterday, 30,000 residents of Helsinki were evacuated. Residents of many cities and border towns have also been evacuated. Patients and the elderly in hospitals are being transported to the countryside by ambulance trains. (Reuters, 12th)

Moscow: Representatives of the Soviet Union and Finland are scheduled to begin talks at 5:00 PM today (local time). The Finnish representative is the country's ambassador to Sweden, Mr. Passikivi. On the Soviet side, Stalin and Foreign Affairs Commissar Molotov will personally attend. (Havas, 12th)

Moscow: The plenipotentiary representative of the Finnish government, Mr. Paasikivi, arrived here yesterday to negotiate political and economic issues between the Soviet Union and Finland. Mr. Paasikivi is accompanied by two staff members, Mr. Paasonen and Mr. Nicklops. Upon arrival at the station, they were greeted by Mr. Bakov, Director of the Treaty Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Deskov, Director of the Baltic Department, Mr. Koskinen, the Finnish Minister, and all the embassy staff, as well as Mr. Winther, the Swedish Minister, and others. (TASS, 12th)

London: According to a broadcast from Rome Radio, the Finnish government has stated that it is willing to make concessions to the Soviet Union, provided that the Soviet Union cedes Soviet Autonomous Republic of Karelia to Finland in exchange. It is said that the Karelian people are of Finnish ethnicity. It is heard that the Finnish Foreign Minister, Mr. Erkko, will deliver a radio address to appeal to the United States today. At the same time, the voluntary evacuation of residents of Helsinki is said to be actively underway. The Finnish people are now watching developments in Moscow. Finnish representatives, including Mr. Paasikivi, arrived in Moscow yesterday and were welcomed at the airfield by representatives of the Soviet government, personnel from the Finnish embassy, and envoys from Scandinavian countries. (Reuters, 12th)

Washington: Responsible officials here declare that if the Soviet Union still values the goodwill of the United States, it is hoped that the Soviet Union will not destroy the integrity of Finland. The Soviet Union must show restraint towards Finland, or a tragedy even worse than the currently limited war may occur. Finland has been prompt in repaying its debts and has made domestic political progress, and is therefore supported by the United States. If there is a country that the United States can regard as a small and brave new Belgium, then that country must be Finland. (Reuters, 12th)

Danzig: News received here this morning from Scandinavian capitals, relayed from the Finnish capital, states that the anxiety among the population caused by the authorities' implementation of civilian evacuation 24 hours ago is now gradually stabilizing. There are two reasons for this shift towards stability: (1) Moscow Radio guaranteed last night that the Soviet Union respects Finland's ties with the Nordic countries; (2) "Pravda" expressed a friendly tone towards Finland, solemnly reiterating that the Soviet Union is determined to maintain peace in Eastern Europe. (Haitong, 12th)

Helsinki: Rumors are circulating that Soviet Russia will put forward demands of a military nature, including the islands of Suursaari, Lavansaari, and Hanko in the Gulf of Finland, attempting to establish military bases at the entrance to Leningrad. Rumors are rampant here, and people are extremely worried. (Haitong, 12th)

Helsinki: Neutral observers in Helsinki have recently declared that Finnish authorities are actively engaged in military preparations. The Finnish Maritime Administration has notified all ships in the country to sail from ports in southern Finland to ports in western Finland. Foreign ships have also received similar notifications. According to Finnish sources, two Soviet military aircraft were spotted over southern Finland yesterday. (Haitong, 12th)

Helsinki: The former Polish ambassador to the Soviet Union arrived here last night from Moscow with 112 members of his staff. According to his report, Soviet troops originally stationed 20 miles from the Soviet-Finnish border have now begun to move to the vicinity of Zhytomyr. The special train carrying the Polish ambassador and his entourage was detained for six hours at the Soviet-Finnish border, allowing him to witness this situation. Finnish forces are also making considerable preparations, with 250,000 troops deployed at strategic points along the border and 125,000 militiamen on standby for mobilization. Diplomats from various countries here are pessimistic about the Finnish government's rejection of Soviet demands. According to news from the Swedish capital last night, Soviet troops have approached within 24 miles of Petsamo, the only port Finland can use to receive foreign aid in wartime. News from Danzig states that the Finnish cabinet is currently considering relocating the capital. The Finnish Navy patrolled the southwest coast last night, and anti-aircraft artillery units are stationed atop tall buildings in major cities. Citizens of major cities have begun to evacuate. (Associated Press, 12th)

The Hague: A correspondent for the "People's Daily" stationed in the Finnish capital has cabled, "The Finnish government is taking preventive measures and dealing with them calmly and systematically." Residents of the country's four major cities are being quickly evacuated, and works of art and cash reserves are being moved to safe areas. Anti-aircraft guns have been deployed on the roofs of many buildings in the capital, and a blackout has been implemented at night. As for bank depositors, withdrawals are limited to 2,000 marks (Finnish currency) per household. From these measures, it can be seen that the country is vigilant about the situation and hopes that the United States will come forward to support it. Rumors are circulating that Soviet troops are concentrating in the northern port of Murmansk. If this is true, then the Finnish port of Petsamo will be threatened. (Havas, 12th)

### After the Signing of the Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty, Memel's Importance Weakens; Molotov Hosts a Banquet for the Lithuanian Foreign Minister

Moscow: After the signing of the mutual assistance treaty between the Soviet Union and Lithuania, the Soviet Union's control over the Baltic coast has been greatly enhanced. The only base that Germany retains in the area is the Memel region, but if the Soviet Union also stations troops near the Memel region, the commercial and political importance of the area will inevitably be greatly weakened. In the future, Germany may have no choice but to withdraw from the Memel region. As for the Soviet-Lithuanian mutual assistance treaty, its validity period is set at 15 years (the mutual assistance treaties signed by the Soviet Union with Estonia and Latvia are both set at 10 years). Some of the provisions are clearly aimed at Germany. In addition, the city of Vilnius and some areas nearby have been decided to be returned to Lithuania. The area around Vilnius is barren and the people are poor, but the city is a railway hub and is of great strategic importance. Although it will nominally be owned by Lithuania again, it will in fact remain within the sphere of Soviet influence. (Havas, 11th)

Moscow: Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and concurrently Foreign Commissar, hosted a banquet last night for the Lithuanian Foreign Minister, Mr. Urbšys. Those present included Lithuanian State Councilor, Mr. Pymikas; Army Commander-in-Chief, General Raštikis; the Lithuanian Minister, Mr. Nakevičius; the Minister of Economy, Mr. Norkaitis; and other officials, as well as Soviet dignitaries such as Stalin, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Kalinin, Kaganovich, Zhdanov, Bulganin, Voznesensky, Kuznetsov, Smolodinov, Lozovsky, and Poznyakov. During the banquet, Molotov and Urbšys exchanged toasts, and the atmosphere was exceptionally cordial. (TASS, 11th)

Kaunas: Thousands of people here cheered in front of the Soviet Embassy last night because the Vilnius region, which Poland had seized from Lithuania in 1920, has now been returned to Lithuania. According to reliable sources, in accordance with the newly concluded Soviet-Lithuanian treaty, "for the sake of mutual security," Soviet troops may be stationed in various locations within Lithuania, except for the Lithuanian capital of Kaunas and other major industrial cities. Once the Lithuanian government moves to Vilnius, the Soviet troops stationed there will be withdrawn. (Reuters, 12th)

Moscow: The Lithuanian Foreign Minister, Mr. Urbšys, accompanied by State Councilor, Mr. Piusys; and Army Commander-in-Chief, Mr. Nastickas; came here the other day to negotiate the conclusion of a mutual assistance treaty and the return of the city of Vilnius. The negotiations have been completed, and they are returning to their country today. Regarding the territory that Soviet Russia has agreed to return to Lithuania, the Soviet Russian authorities have already prepared for the transfer, but the implementation of administrative and economic reorganization, formal integration into Lithuania, and restoration of customs checkpoints will take several months. It is reported that the Soviet-Lithuanian agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union may station 20,000 troops in the three towns of Klem, Veiveriai, and Kaisiadorys in Lithuania, and 2,000 air force personnel at various air bases. (Haitong, 12th)

Paris: A dispatch from the "Paris Daily News" correspondent in Amsterdam states that after Germany concluded an alliance treaty with the Soviet Union, it withdrew from the Baltic countries. It is heard that key figures in the National Socialist Party and the German military are greatly dissatisfied with this. Some of these people participated in the organization of German Free Corps in the Baltic countries and now feel that it is an incomprehensible sacrifice for Germany to abandon its inherent position in countries where culture originated in Germany. Great disapproval. (Reuters, 12th)

### Soviet "Pravda" on Policy of Peace; Significance of Soviet-Lithuanian Treaty

Moscow: An editorial in "Pravda" states, "The Soviet Union's policy of peace and good neighborliness has recently seen repeated successes. Yesterday, the Soviet Union returned the province and city of Vilnius to Lithuania, and the Soviet-Lithuanian mutual assistance treaty has also been signed. Through this treaty, as well as the Soviet-Estonian and Soviet-Latvian treaties, the Soviet Union has further consolidated its borders and national defense. The threat of imperialist powers to the Soviet Union's neighbors has now been eliminated. An iron line of defense has been established in the Baltic Sea, and a stable peace has been established in Eastern Europe. Our people should be extremely satisfied with the signing of this treaty. Our people should support the government's wise policy, because this policy can ensure the peace and inviolability of our country through friendly treaties with our neighbors. Today, with the European war raging, Stalin's policy of peace is gradually and consistently eliminating the risk of various small countries being drawn into the war, as these small countries cannot defend their independence, security, and the peaceful labor of their people by their own strength.

"The significance of the signing of the Soviet-Lithuanian treaty is great, and it is an important part of the Soviet-Lithuanian policy of friendship promoted by the Soviet government for twenty years. At the same time, it is the most complete expression of the principle of mutual assistance between the two friendly countries and the principle of jointly protecting the borders of Lithuania.

"Lithuania was originally established under the unstable conditions of the Treaty of Versailles and the re-division of the world. At that time, the major imperialist countries arbitrarily divided Europe. The Lithuanian people found it difficult to resist Polish aggression. The Soviet Union was the first to recognize the Republic of Lithuania and provide assistance. Other countries recognized it only after that. In 1920, the Polish warlords forcibly occupied the ancient Lithuanian capital of Vilnius. The imperialist countries at the time all recognized this, but only the Soviet Union firmly protested and did not recognize it as Polish territory. The Soviet people only had sympathy for the Lithuanian people's struggle against Polish misrule.

"The Soviet Union and Lithuania concluded a non-aggression treaty in 1926, which was extended in 1934. After the disintegration of Poland, a new situation has arisen. The Red Army has liberated Ukrainians and Belarusians who were oppressed by Polish imperialism, as well as the city of Vilnius, which was forcibly occupied by Polish warlords for about twenty years. The Soviet Union and Lithuania have become neighbors, and the border is in the process of being demarcated. Based on this new situation and the newly emerging national defense issues, the Soviet Union and Lithuania, starting from their old friendly relations, have resolved all important matters based on the principle of mutual assistance and respect for the interests and security of both countries. From now on, the borders of Lithuania will be protected by joint military forces, and the Soviet Union will also enhance its national defense. The Soviet-Lithuanian treaty fully embodies the principle of mutual assistance. Our country has been guaranteed, and Lithuania has also met its national interests. This kind of good-neighborly policy can be followed by all countries in the world.

"Since ancient times, the history of international diplomacy has been soaked in blood, and wars can never be eliminated. To this day, they remain a threat to human life and cultural development, but the Soviet Union alone can peacefully resolve various diplomatic issues. The reason for this is that the foreign policy of a socialist country is a policy of peace and friendship towards all countries. The foundation of the Lenin-Stalin policy is friendship between nations, and all the people of the Soviet Union support it. The Soviet Union has now set an example for the world in peacefully resolving the most difficult diplomatic issues and building friendly relations between all nations." (TASS, 11th)

### Trade Agreement Concluded Between Soviet Union and United Kingdom; Britain Exchanges Rubber and Tin for Soviet Lumber; Agreement is Commercial in Nature, With No Political Significance

London: According to official sources, the British Ministry of Supply and the Soviet trade delegation in London today concluded an agreement to exchange Soviet lumber for British rubber and tin. This is commercial in nature and has nothing to do with politics, as the above-mentioned items are part of Anglo-Soviet trade. The official announcement mentions the shipping obstacles after the Soviet ports freeze, and says that the difficulties arising from the revocation of export licenses have affected many timbers that cannot be shipped out. The purpose of this negotiation is to enable the items needed by both Britain and the Soviet Union to circulate. The tin purchased by the Soviet Union is mostly paid for on a periodic basis in accordance with long-term commercial contracts. The prices of all lumber, rubber, and tin are pre-agreed, and the value of the exchanged goods will be absolutely equal. The quantity depends on what can be shipped out of the northern ports before the ice season. It is expected that the above-mentioned agreement is only the first result of Anglo-Soviet negotiations. Today, Liberal Party member Mandle, an opposition member, asked the government in the Lower House what action it would take regarding the Soviet government's proposal to the UK to reopen commercial negotiations. Foreign Undersecretary Butler replied that the issue of adapting Anglo-Soviet trade relations to the state of war is being considered. The British government is currently discussing some preliminary difficulties with the Soviet government. Mandle asked again whether the British government wanted to conduct these negotiations. Butler replied that if Mandle was referring to Minister for Overseas Trade Hudson traveling to Moscow, there was no suggestion of reopening commercial talks at that time. Mandle considered this answer unsatisfactory and declared that he would raise the matter again. (Reuters, 11th)

London: According to official sources, representatives of the British Ministry of Supply have signed a barter agreement with the Soviet trade delegation, stipulating that Britain will exchange tin and rubber for Soviet timber. According to well-informed sources here, this agreement is purely commercial and has no political significance. The Soviet Union usually exports timber to Britain and imports tin and rubber from Britain. Due to the approaching winter, some Soviet ports will soon freeze, and cargo ships must leave before the ports are closed. Therefore, it is urgent to sign an agreement with Britain. Soviet sources say that the two sides have exchanged goods, but the Soviet government is still unable to guarantee the safety of transportation, and Britain must send warships to escort them.

### 158,000 British Troops Arrived in France; German Air Force Ordered to Continue Bombing British Ships; All Activity Greatly Increased on Western Front

Berlin: The German Air Force has been ordered to continue attacking British ships blockading the North Sea. This is considered the most important instruction since the end of the Polish campaign. At the same time, German aircraft are now preparing to launch a major attack on the British fleet if Hitler's peace proposals are rejected. (Reuters, 12th)

London: The Admiralty has just issued a communiqué stating that several German aircraft attacked our fleet of cruisers in the North Sea on the 9th of this month. The two sides exchanged fire for five hours. The enemy aircraft dropped no fewer than a hundred bombs, several of which fell near one of the cruisers, causing shrapnel to fall on the ship. (Havas, 11th)

Berlin: The German official news agency published the results of the German naval and air force activities in the North Sea, saying that in recent days, German naval vessels have been ordered to concentrate in the northern North Sea to protect merchant ships, search for contraband, and protect shipping. On the morning of the 9th of this month, after a German reconnaissance plane discovered a British ship at the southern tip of Norway, it sent a radio report. The German Air Force and seaplanes immediately flew to bomb it. Although the weather was bad and the British ship's anti-aircraft fire was fierce, the German aircraft still hit the British ship with six heavy bombs and several medium bombs. The German aircraft flew back to base in the middle of the night, flying non-stop on the sea for eight to ten hours. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

Paris: French Air Force Minister Chambe today told the Senate Aviation Committee that although there were more German aircraft than French aircraft in the repeated air battles, French fighter aircraft were indeed superior to German aircraft. (Reuters, 12th)

Paris: The General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 75, stating that "Enemy reconnaissance units continued to conduct reconnaissance between the Saar River and the Inselles River today and were very active. The two sides exchanged fire in the same area." (Havas, 11th)

Paris: The German Commander-in-Chief seems to want to obtain information about the French army's positions and strength along the Rhine and Moselle Rivers. The German army has not engaged in large-scale attacks with dense infantry, but has repeatedly attacked with small patrols in an attempt to gather information and capture prisoners in order to find out the truth from the prisoners' mouths. However, the German attacking teams were blocked by machine guns and light artillery fire. German reconnaissance planes are active and frequently take oblique photographs of French defenses from behind the German lines. Yesterday, taking advantage of the bad atmosphere, they took a few vertical photographs of the French lines. Semi-official sources here claim that the reason for the German activity is that the Germans have decided to recover lost ground and fear that high water in the Rhine River will flood the German forward positions. (Reuters, 12th)

Berlin: The German Army Commander-in-Chief announced the war situation on each front at noon today, as follows: (1) On the Eastern Front, German troops reached the Bug River in central Poland; (2) On the Western Front, there was only insignificant artillery fire; (3) There was reconnaissance activity in the skies over the North Sea; (4) An air battle took place in Wittenburg, and a French aircraft was shot down. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)

London: British War Secretary Hore-Belisha gave the first report on the actions of British troops in wartime in the Lower House today, saying that within five weeks of the outbreak of war, Britain had sent 158,000 soldiers to France. Britain has fulfilled its obligations to France by sending a certain number of troops to assist France within a certain period of time. More troops will continue to cross the English Channel and go to the front lines. During this period, we have re-established bases and lines of communication, and organized everything so that various supplies and munitions can be shipped out in a continuous stream. The main procedures have now been arranged. Today's work is very different from 1914. At that time, Britain had only 800 mechanical vehicles, and there were not many with a load of more than two tons. Today, we have transported more than 25,000 mechanical vehicles, including tanks, to France, some of which are very large and weigh more than 15 tons. (Reuters, 11th)

London: War Secretary Hore-Belisha made a speech in the House of Commons this afternoon, saying, "After the British army arrived in France, it was placed under the command of the French Commander-in-Chief, so military orders have been unified. If the British commander has any opinions, he can submit them to the British Cabinet, but since the opinions of Britain and France are completely consistent, there is almost no need to exercise this right of speech, and when necessary, the French army can also be placed under the command of the British Commander-in-Chief." He then answered a question from a member, saying, "The British troops sent to France are well-equipped and second to none, and their supplies are very sufficient. This can be proven by people from neutral countries, such as Americans. This army is now divided into two armies, with General Dill as the commander of the First Army and General Brooke as the commander of the Second Army. In addition, the British garrison and military equipment in the Near East have also been greatly strengthened. In short, the number of expeditionary forces sent by Britain to France has so far met or exceeded our obligations to France and is sufficient for all of you. The troops currently being dispatched are not the last batch. Compared with the situation in 1914, the infantry now accounts for 20 percent, and each battalion is equipped with 50 machine guns and 21 defensive guns. In 1914, the infantry accounted for 60 percent, so the firepower of this expeditionary force far exceeds that of before. The front-line soldiers are now busy building fortifications to consolidate their positions. As for the country, we will still need to greatly conscript manpower in the future. Each conscripted troop will also recruit volunteers. Since the outbreak of the war, there have been 50,000 of these volunteers. Those who are older will be organized into the National Defence Force to protect this headquarters." (Havas, 11th)

### German-Bulgarian Trade Negotiations Successfully Concluded

Sofia: Economic negotiations between Germany and Bulgaria, conducted here, were successfully concluded yesterday. In addition to the German-Bulgarian trade clearing agreement of 1932, several new agreements have been signed. The German delegation departed last night to return home. (Haitong, 12th)

Bulgarian Capital: Trade negotiations between Germany and Bulgaria have been going on for a long time. Several agreements have now been reached to supplement the current trade treaty and offset agreement. (Havas, 11th)

### British Warship Intercepts German Ship

London: The German ship "Cap Norte" was intercepted by a British warship in the southern Atlantic Ocean after departing from the Brazilian port of Pernambuco on the 17th of last month. The ship has a displacement of 13,615 tons. (Havas, 12th)

Paris: The Information Office has just released a message stating that the French Navy's implementation of the blockade of Germany has had significant effects since the 10th of this month. A total of 150,000 tons of contraband destined for Germany has been seized, of which 40,000 tons are of various metal ores, including tungsten, antimony, nickel, and mercury, which are needed by German war industries, 40,000 tons of grain, and more than 30,000 tons of liquid fuel.

### Expansion of the Japanese Foreign Ministry Crisis: A Potential for a Cabinet Crisis; 106 People Resign Jointly; Officials at Overseas Embassies and Consulates Respond One after Another

Tokyo – The wave of resignations at the Foreign Ministry, triggered by the Cabinet's decision to establish a Ministry of Trade, now threatens to cause a cabinet crisis. A total of 106 people have resigned from the Foreign Ministry. The resignations were submitted to the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs last night. A committee composed of department directors and senior officials convened yesterday afternoon to await new proposals from Foreign Minister Nomura. After waiting until 7:30 PM, no new proposals were forthcoming. The committee then convened a general meeting of 120 senior officials in the Foreign Ministry conference room. During the meeting, the head of the Intelligence Bureau, Tatsuo Kawai, entered the venue and declared his willingness to join. After the head of the Research Bureau reported on the committee's work, the head of the Documentation Department addressed the assembly. Subsequently, the entire assembly unanimously approved the committee's measures and decided that there was no other option but to resign, as all compromises had failed.

Tokyo – Regarding the Ministry of Trade issue, Prime Minister Abe, Foreign Minister Nomura, and Minister of Interior Ogawa held discussions on the morning of the 12th. As a result, they decided to communicate the government's opinions to the senior officials of the Foreign Ministry.

As for the handling of the resignations, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tani was instructed to return each resignation to its original submitter. Foreign Minister Nomura's explanation and the efforts of senior Foreign Ministry officials such as Mr. Aizawa were also instrumental in achieving this.

### Japanese Authorities Review Raw Material Issues

Tokyo – Japanese officials convened a meeting here to re-examine the mobilization plan for various raw materials in Japan, Manchuria, and the occupied areas of China in light of the potential impact of the European war. It is reported that this meeting is currently discussing taking necessary steps to revise the procedures previously proposed to expand production and facilitate control. Yesterday was the third day of the meeting. Mr. Uemura of the Cabinet Planning Board explained the procedures for expanding industrial strength and mentioned the cotton problem. Hoshino, Director-General of the General Affairs Department of the Manchurian State Council, arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday to attend the meeting and will stay here for about ten days. It is expected that he will explain the details of Manchuria's revised raw material mobilization plan during this period. Hoshino may also seek to make further revisions. It is rumored that Manchuria has decided to postpone non-essential industrial projects and concentrate its efforts on increasing coal and iron production in view of the new difficulties encountered in implementing the original five-year plan due to the inability to obtain raw materials from Europe.

### Smooth Progress in Soviet-Turkish Negotiations; Soviet-Turkish and British-Turkish Agreements Expected to Be Signed Soon

Ankara – According to a communiqué, Turkish Prime Minister Saydam explained the Soviet-Turkish negotiations in detail to the members of the Republican People's Party today. The party expressed its agreement with the government's views. Political circles believe that the new Soviet-Turkish treaty and the British-French-Turkish mutual assistance pact will both be signed soon. (Reuters, 11th)

London – According to reliable sources yesterday, the Soviet-Turkish agreement will be signed within 24 hours, and the British-Turkish interim agreement will follow. However, it is doubtful whether it can be signed immediately so that Prime Minister Chamberlain can report to Parliament today. The British-Turkish agreement will include clauses on military assistance in the event of aggression in the Mediterranean and German aggression against the Balkan countries. (Associated Press, 11th)

The Milanese newspaper, "Sparta", received a report from Cairo stating how Egypt and other Arab countries must react to Turkey's attitude. The entire Arab world, from the Nile to the Tigris, has been completely focused on Turkey's attitude for the past four weeks. Egypt is particularly interested in observing the development of Turkey's situation. If Greece were to encounter difficulties, Turkey would defend the Suez Canal and the Nile Delta, given Egypt's participation in the democratic front. However, there are now fears that Turkey may join forces with Germany and the Soviet Union. If a world war were to occur, Turkey would not only fail to protect the Suez Canal but might even invade it. Therefore, after receiving intelligence about the Turkish Foreign Minister's activities in Moscow, the Egyptian government was alarmed. The Arabs believe that although Britain is quickly dispatching troops and aircraft to Egypt, continuing military deployments, and establishing defenses on the borders of Iraq and India, Britain will still fail if it cannot obtain Turkey's assistance. The newspaper also stated that the Cairo-published "Al-Ahram" newspaper received a report from Istanbul stating that the Soviet Union is strongly urging Turkey not to allow British and French naval, land, and air forces to pass through its territory if Britain and France send troops to Romania. Turkish officials firmly believe that the Soviet Union is determined to prevent British and French forces from reaching the Black Sea and to provide Romania with assistance. "Al-Mokattam" reported that the Soviet Union's sole reason for preserving Turkey is that they know Turkey's opinions regarding the Soviet Union and will obey orders. This point is very important for the countries of the Near East and the Middle East and should not be overlooked. (Haitong Telegraph, 12th)

### Soviet Warships Visit Estonia; Soviet-Estonian Military Negotiations Successfully Concluded

Estonian Capital – Three Soviet destroyers visited here yesterday. When the Soviet warships entered the harbor, they fired a 21-gun salute, and the Estonian coastal artillery also fired a salute in response. (Haitong Telegraph, 12th)

Moscow – An official communiqué was recently released stating that negotiations between Soviet and Estonian military experts have been successfully concluded. The Soviet government has also invited General Laidoner, Chief of the General Staff of the Estonian Army, to visit for consultations, but the date has not yet been determined. In addition, a Latvian economic delegation will come here to negotiate a trade treaty. (Havas, 11th)

Latvian Capital – The Soviet military delegation has been conducting negotiations with the Estonian military delegation for several days. Both sides have expressed agreement on the matter of extending the entry of Soviet troops into Estonian territory until October 19. Now that the Soviet-Estonian military negotiations have been completed, part of the Soviet delegation has already left the Estonian capital. According to newspaper reports, the Estonian President has confirmed the signing of a draft Soviet-Estonian agreement. It is reported that the Estonian Commander-in-Chief of the Army is scheduled to announce the conclusion of the Soviet-Estonian military agreement on the radio today. (Haitong Telegraph, 12th)

### US Senate Debates Arms Embargo Issue; Two Factions of Senators Engage in Heated Debate; Bora Advocates Freedom of Navigation in the Pacific

Washington – The Senate continued to discuss the Neutrality Act amendment today. Senator Clark, a Democratic separatist, delivered a speech advocating the maintenance of the arms embargo, speaking eloquently for four hours. His arguments were based on isolationist viewpoints. Senator Burke, a Democrat, advocated for the repeal of the arms embargo, saying that the current Neutrality Act benefits Germany and cannot be defended in the name of neutrality. Senator Gna, a Republican, also spoke, reversing his original position and announcing his decision to vote in favor of repealing the arms embargo. The discussion today can be said to have gone deep into the details. Clark presented the isolationist viewpoint and criticized President Roosevelt's attitude and that of Republican Senator Johnson (who had proposed that President Roosevelt mediate the European war). Burke, who was originally a separatist, has now returned to the government faction and was the first to say that the American people are also interested in the current war in Europe ideologically, but he did not advocate that the United States cooperate with Britain and France in the war. Political figures say that Burke's speech today was supported by most people. The Democratic government faction had originally not mentioned their ideological views on the European war, fearing that mentioning ideology would hinder the repeal of the arms embargo. Burke was able to say what others had not said, which gained unexpected support. The isolationists, who had wanted to use ideological viewpoints to achieve victory, were amazed by Burke's speech. (Havas, 11th)

Washington – Senator Clark, a Missouri isolationist Democrat, launched a fierce attack yesterday during the Senate debate on the Neutrality Act amendment against Assistant Secretary of War Johnson's proposal to increase the army to 600,000, calling it "delirious, childish, and unpatriotic." He said that Johnson was trying to incite a war mentality among the public. Clark called the Neutrality Act amendment "their goal" to enable the Allied nations of Europe to receive American aid. "If we want to participate in defending Britain and France, it is a suicidal policy." Clark suggested prohibiting the transport of arms and other materials to belligerent countries, and that cash-and-carry be used for other goods. Clark also attacked Johnson, saying that Johnson had illegally established a war raw materials association and filled it with people from Morgan and DuPont. Although President Roosevelt had declared that the association had been disbanded, they continued to work. Clark's speech was the main program for isolationists to attack the Neutrality Act amendment. The Senate corridors were filled with listeners. (Associated Press, 12th)

### Formation of the Soviet Provincial Mobilization Committee: "Don't Give Soldiers to the Enemy Association"; Strive to Prevent Strong Men from Being Conscripted by the Japanese Army

Taixian Correspondence: The Japanese army often forcibly conscripts strong men in the occupied areas to be used by them. The Jiangsu Provincial Mobilization Committee of the Lu-Su War Zone was recently ordered to organize a "Don't Give Soldiers to the Enemy League" to thwart the Japanese army's plan. The committee will immediately work with the Political Training Department of the Lu-Su War Zone Deputy Commander-in-Chief Headquarters to formulate temporary measures for the organization of the "Jiangsu People's Don't Give Soldiers to the Enemy League" and its county branches. These measures will be submitted to the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Lu-Su War Zone for approval and implementation.

### Japanese Army in Jiangyin Attacked During Rural Propaganda Campaign

Fantasies of Collecting Land Tax Also Suffer Blows

Jiangyin Correspondence: The four townships of Jiangyin have long been controlled by guerrilla forces, but the Japanese and puppet sides often attempt to collect land taxes from the four townships. In the past half-month, Japanese Police Captain Shigeno has repeatedly led Japanese troops and puppet police to the townships for propaganda. They have visited Xin'jie, Shengangbei, and other places. On the third of this month, they took a car to Qingyang, arriving at Qiaoqi at 7:00 PM. After resting for an hour, they went to Changshou, distributing absurd leaflets and posting slogans along the way. After staying overnight in Changshou, they set off for Zhutang on the fourth. When they reached the Dazhai Liujiaji area, someone reported that there were weapons hidden there. The Japanese army searched and took away a small number of guns and bullets. At noon, they reached the Hudaqiao Xiaoliujiaji area, which is where the guerrillas are located. They did not encounter them. They found several armed items somewhere and set them on fire. They stayed overnight at Hudaqiao that night. On the morning of the fifth, they returned to Zhutang. After breakfast, they traveled half a mile and encountered a large number of guerrillas. Guns and cannons were fired simultaneously. They opened fire in the Zhoujiaji area. Both sides suffered casualties. The Japanese army was almost surrounded but later broke through and went to Hehuqiao. In the middle of the night, they were attacked again by the Chinese army. The Japanese army only fired machine guns indiscriminately in the dark. On the sixth, they went to Mencun Xiyangqiao and went straight to Huangtang for lunch. Then they stayed overnight at Zhutang. At 3:00 AM on the morning of the seventh, the Chinese army from Yangjiazhuang attacked. Fearing being blocked, the Japanese army retreated to Huangtang for lunch and walked to Qingyang to return to the city. The Japanese army suffered a considerable blow during this trip to the townships, and collecting land taxes has become a fantasy.

### Atrocity of Japanese Warships in Guangdong Sea in Hailufeng: Burning Defenseless Fishing and Salt Boats, Over 1,000 Vessels Destroyed in Two Days

Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese army in Chaoshan has been besieged for more than a month. They failed twice to break through to Fengxi and Yuntishan and were defeated miserably twice in attacking Sangshan (once from Shan Hong'an to Shaxi, and once from Anbu to Jiaoshi). They have resorted to using the strength of the marine fleet to harass Waiqian in an attempt to relieve the siege of Chaoshan. They initially invaded Raoping, Zhelin, and Haishan, but after failing, they turned to the Hailufeng area and were extremely brutal. All of this happened in late September. The Chinese army was already waiting in ambush in the mountains of ×××××× to annihilate the Japanese army in Chaoshan and along the coast.

On the afternoon of September 24, a huge Japanese warship suddenly docked at Daya Bay Port in Haifeng. Two destroyers arrived in the waters of Daa. On the morning of the 25th, two aircraft were dispatched from the warship to scout along the coast. Three bombs were dropped on Dazhou and Erzhou. They bombed the ports of Fei, Xunliao, and Xinliao, sinking more than a dozen fishing boats. At 9:00 AM, more than 300 soldiers were dispatched on more than 20 boats and landed in three batches to harass Gangkou Town. The local guard team and salt police team fought bravely. The Chinese army was too small in number and retreated to Pinghai City. The Japanese soldiers looted Gangkou Town and then took boats to Touliao, Xiazhai, Danjialiao, and other places, setting fire to salt boats, fishing boats, fishing boats, and houseboat. In one day, 240 boats were burned. They then turned to Magong and other places. On the 26th, more than 400 boats were burned. More than 80% of the boats in Shanwei Port were burned. There were more than 3,000 fishermen and salt workers who suffered. On the 27th, more than 20 motorboats were dispatched to carry more than 200 soldiers and landed in the areas of Renyou Fanggang, Xunliao, and Xingang, burning more than 200 fishing boats. On the 28th, a huge Japanese warship arrived off the coast of Jinxiang in Lufeng. Five motorboats were dispatched at Haiziai, dragging rubber boats to carry more than 100 soldiers, and aircraft were used to cover them in chasing the fishing and salt boats along the coast. As a result, ten large fishing boats were burned, and the fishing boats that escaped to the Jieshi warship were shelled, sinking several. This is a miracle of the Japanese Navy's war, specializing in intimidating fishing and salt boats.

### First Battle After Returning to Hong Kong: South China Defeats Hong Kong League in the Rain - 4 to 1, Halftime Tied at 1 Each - Hui Tang, Dou Wen, and Zhaorong All Score Big

(Hong Kong Dispatch) The South China Football Team returned from a long expedition and played its first game yesterday (the 1st), facing the Hong Kong League team at the Jia Shan Stadium. A large number of spectators came to watch. Li Tiansheng, Feng Jingxiang, and Zhang Rongcai of South China were injured, and Liu Qingcai had returned to Macau, so they were not present. Tan Jun'gan took over as goalkeeper. They initially played with ten men, and the Hong Kong League took the opportunity to score a goal. Guo Yingqi arrived after twelve minutes, and the situation improved. The score was one-to-one at halftime, with no clear winner. After switching sides, they fought in the rain, and South China scored three consecutive goals, ultimately defeating the Hong Kong League with a score of four to one.

Tan Jun'gan

Li Guowei, Mai Shaohan

Song Lingsheng, Liang Rongzhao, Guo Yingqi

Luo Douwen, Li Zhaorong, Li Huitang, Chen Dehui, Deng Guangsen

Deng Qin

Shi Han, Bi Liban

Xu Jingcheng, Ge Fu, Fei Shiwo Sheng

Hou Chengtao, Hua Liya, He Xi, Zuo Zhi, Zhong Yongsen

Hong Kong League Team Scores First

After seven minutes, the Hong Kong League team launched a fierce attack on South China. Hua Liya was like a cunning rabbit, weaving through key areas. He took a pass from Yongsen and headed it towards the center, where He Xi and Chengtao both sprinted forward. Hou Chengtao kicked nimbly and scored (1-0). After South China conceded a goal, Yingqi joined the team after sixteen minutes to make up the numbers. Their morale was boosted. Douwen received a pass from the midfield and took a cold, angled shot with great force, but it was caught by Deng Qin. After thirty minutes, Hua Liya again aimed like drawing a bow, taking the path of least resistance, and passed diagonally to Zuo Zhi. The prodigy Zuo Zhi fired a long-range shot that hit the post and bounced out. Lingsheng arrived in time and cleared the ball with a kick. Huitang took the ball and advanced fiercely, attempting a solo attack on the goal. Deng Qin dived to save it, narrowly avoiding disaster. After thirty-five minutes, Zhaorong created an opportunity in the Hong Kong League's defense and lightly passed it to Huitang. Huitang turned around and swept the ball, which flew like an arrow, diagonally into the net from under the crossbar, tying the score at one-to-one.

South China Scores Three Consecutive Goals

After eight minutes, heavy rain began to pour. Huitang created confusion in the middle, and Bi Liban was unable to intercept him, falling to the ground. Huitang sent a wink, and Douwen intercepted the ball and took an angled shot. Deng Qin was unaware of the ball's trajectory, and the goal was lost (2-1). After seventeen minutes, Huitang took a long-range shot from about forty yards, hitting the crossbar. Zhaorong seized the opportunity, charged straight in, and scored with a close-range shot, making it three-to-one. After twenty-four minutes, the Hong Kong League briefly launched a fierce attack on South China. Guowei and Shaohan were extremely busy. Tan Jun'gan finally caught He En's header and kicked it to Huitang. Dehui and Huitang advanced together, and then passed it to Guangsen. Guangsen shot the ball down the left side, and Zhuoni Wen repeated his old trick, scoring another goal, making it four-to-one. The southern expedition army declared victory.

### East Surrey Defeats West Force - 3 to 1

The reserve members of the British East Surrey and the Scottish West Force met on the field the day before Double Ten, resulting in a 3-1 defeat for the Scottish army.  The main forces of both sides met again at Yiyuan at 3:15 pm yesterday before the league matches began. As a result, the Scottish army suffered another crushing defeat, with the score also being 3-1, which was quite a coincidence. The match was extremely intense. West Force's goalkeeper Egginson, left-back Kai Moer, and center-back Maxgan were all seriously injured. East Surrey led by two goals to zero at halftime.

### Zhou Dayun and Cai Yanxiong Perform in Hong Kong

(Hong Kong Dispatch) Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Dayun came from Shanghai and specially invited comrades in Hong Kong to hastily form the Shanghai basketball team. The movie emperor Jin Yan also participated. The time was short and there was no way to change the schedule. They originally intended to invite the Hong Kong champion South China team, but it was temporarily unavailable. Later, through the mediation of Guo Mukai, a sports official from the YMCA, they invited the Star Island team, which was composed of former YMCA players, to play against them. After the decision was made, they also found Feng Nianhua and Xu Heng. The YMCA then issued a notice of the ball game.

Match

The game started at eight o'clock. The skills of both sides were not as ideally exciting. The Shanghai United team was, after all, a temporary combination, and encountered such a small field. The connection was not perfect, but the individual techniques were quite good. Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Dayun were especially admired by the fans. Jin Yan played not badly. Yanxiong's snatching skills and fancy ball handling were all applauded. Dayun's sideline shots were well received. The Star Island team's playing style did not deviate from its old style. The field was small, the contact was tight, the game was dragging, and there were many fouls. Li Guoduo and Chen Shipin committed four fouls each and were dismissed, which was a flaw.

The Shanghai United team led all the way, taking a lead of 20 to 15 in the first half. After switching sides, they continued their efforts and ended the whole game with a score of 40 to 25. The Shanghai United team was often careless in penalty shots, missing many, which was a great disadvantage. Otherwise, they could have made a bigger score. The closest the Star Island team came was in the first half when the score was 6 to 9, but in the second half, the difference was too far at 18 to 33. Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Dayun will leave here today and go their separate ways. No one knows when the Shanghai United team will return to the battlefield. The scores of the two teams are listed below.

### Finance: The Situation Worsens Daily, Spot Gold Plunges Again, Reaching a Low of 3930 Yuan - A Situation of Easy Decline and Difficult Rise

Yesterday, the spot gold market continued its downward trend. The reason is that both domestic and international news were unfavorable, causing many to suffer losses. The general traders in the market mostly aimed for small profits, and few stored gold for the long term. The trend was that whenever there was a slight increase in buying, it was not easy to raise prices, and when selling, it was easy to decline.  In yesterday's situation, the market opened flat and weak at 3,995 yuan.  Soon after, the securities firms bought in, and at the same time, the foreign exchange rate softened slightly. Gold firms also followed suit, breaking through the 4,000 yuan mark again, reaching a high of 4,020 yuan.  Then, as money changers sold out, the price returned to the 4,000 yuan mark.  Although Hong Kong firms bought in more than 200 taels, the high price was difficult to sustain for long due to the easing of foreign exchange rates and the imbalance of supply and demand.  By noon, it had fallen to only 3,955 yuan.  In the afternoon, the gold firms reappeared, and the foreign exchange rate continued to be strong, creating a new low price of 3,930 yuan.  Suddenly, Hong Kong firms slightly bought in a small amount, and the situation stabilized.  It closed at 3,940 yuan, a further drop of 60 yuan. Trading throughout the day was smooth, about 1,300 to 1,400 taels.  Gold jewelry was priced at a small five yuan.  Customs gold and other gold remained stable.

Spot Gold Fell Another 60 Yuan

The initial situation after the lunar festival was relatively peaceful. The opening price was 5 yuan lower than the previous close. A certain gold firm sold 30 taels to the securities firms for 3,995 yuan. After the opening, the securities firms' buying was still strong, and they frequently raised bids. Soon, it rose by 15 yuan. The securities firms bought 10 taels from the money changers at a price of 4,010 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange rate softened slightly, and a certain gold firm also tracked and bought, causing the price to rise another 10 yuan. A certain gold firm bought 20 taels from a certain money changer for 4,020 yuan. However, the foreign exchange rate suddenly strengthened, and a certain money changer aggressively sold at a high price, causing the price to fall. Before long, it fell back by 20 yuan. At that time, a certain silver firm bought in on behalf of the Hong Kong firms, and colleagues, money changers, and gold firms bought a total of 260 taels, all at a price of 4,000 yuan. Later, retail investors followed suit, and the price once rebounded to 4,004 yuan. After that, because the selling pressure rose again, silver firms and spot gold firms frequently sold, and a certain securities firm also sold out. In addition, the Hong Kong firms were cautious and did not move forward, causing the price to fall again, eventually falling by 38 yuan. A silver firm sold 20 taels to the money changers for 3,966 yuan. At that time, another securities firm came to absorb it and rebounded by 14 yuan. The securities firms bought 10 taels from the money changers at a price of 3,980 yuan. At noon, a certain money changer sold on behalf of the shorts, and the spot gold firms still had a strong desire to sell, causing the price to fall another 25 yuan. A spot gold firm sold 20 taels to the silver firms for 3,955 yuan. Then, the money changers traded 30 taels among themselves for 3,956 yuan as the closing price for the afternoon. The initial opening in the afternoon was flat. Initially, a gold firm sold 20 taels to the money changers for 3,955 yuan. At that time, the spot gold firms still had a strong desire to sell, and the foreign exchange rate continued to strengthen slightly, causing the price to fall by 25 yuan. The money changers sold 20 taels to the spot gold firms for 3,930 yuan. After that, a certain gold firm bought at a low price on behalf of customers, once rebounding to 3,955 yuan. After entering, because retail investors resumed selling, they entrusted the money changers to sell, causing the price to decline again, even retreating into the 3,940 yuan range. At that time, a certain silver firm bought slightly on behalf of the Hong Kong firms, and the potential stabilized. It is estimated that a certain silver firm absorbed 30 taels from the money changers for 3,938 yuan, and then bought 20 taels from the spot firms for 3,940 yuan. The closing price last night was 60 yuan lower than the day before yesterday. It is heard that after the close, the spot gold firms absorbed dozens of taels from the money changers at a price of 3,938 yuan and 3,940 yuan. The price fluctuated by 90 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the spot gold firms' own gold was 10 yuan higher than the spot price, and the buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan. The spot standard gold was more than 10 yuan lower than the listed gold, and few transactions were made.

Gold Jewelry Changed to 400 Yuan

The initial selling price of gold jewelry was 405 yuan, but at noon it was reduced by 5 yuan. After that, there were no changes. As a result, Datong Bank changed the listed price to 400 yuan. The new banks had the same price as the old banks, and the buying price was reduced by about 20 yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Spot and Futures Slightly Diverged

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed prices. The trend of the black market for the British and American currencies seemed to have entered a normal and extremely stable state. There was no tension throughout the day.

The British pound fell by 0.03125, while the American dollar remained unchanged. Later, a certain bank had a good appetite and the situation tightened slightly. However, due to the Hong Kong telegraphic transfer sale and the fact that a certain bank had more sales than purchases, coupled with HSBC's sudden desire to sell, although Chinese banks came to absorb it, the situation was still loose due to ample funds. The result was a closing price of 4 pence 6875 and 7 yuan 875, which was the loosest price of the day (equivalent to a British-American exchange rate of 4 yuan 0.03125). Compared with the day before yesterday, both the British and American currencies loosened by 0.0625.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Retreated, Foreign Debt Prices Declined Sharply, with British and French Debt Falling the Most by 10 Pounds

The securities black market suddenly saw a reversal yesterday, with a sharp drop of 1 to 2 yuan. Because the government denied the rumor that Kohl was mediating the Sino-Japanese war, and the London prices of Chinese foreign debt suddenly fell sharply by 5 to 10 pounds, the bulls suddenly exited the market. There were still many buyers at the initial trading, but later there were few buyers, and the decline was also sharp. In addition, the old shorts had almost covered their positions, and the new shorts had little profit, so few covered their positions. The biggest drop was in Type A bonds. If the environment does not change much, it should fluctuate for a while. Yesterday, the selling pressure was extremely strong in the morning. No one cared about Type D bonds, which will be drawn soon. The rest were slightly weak at the initial trading. Then, because Yongkang, Tongkang, Wukang, Daqing, and general retail investors sold, although Tian Sheng, Song Mao, and other firms bought, there was more supply than demand, and the market price fell sharply. The situation stabilized slightly in the afternoon, but there was no sign of recovery. Yongkang still sold, and Tongkang slightly covered their positions. The market price fell by 1.25 to 2.05 yuan. The total trading volume was about 1 million. A summary table is listed below.

Stock Trading: 30 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 8.25 yuan.

Also, the Public Exchange reported that, due to the opening of new trading in the afternoon, buyers came fiercely, and brokers worked hard to complete a large number of orders. In the short hour of the afternoon, there was almost no time to spare, so all brokers felt tired and exhausted. New high prices were discovered for Jardine Matheson shares, International Trust Company shares, Shanghai Silver Company shares, and Yangzi Silver Company shares. Even the various rubber shares that had been ignored for a long time gained a place in yesterday's rising trading. It is difficult to imagine whether the market can continue to maintain its current pace. Although there is current trading, it is backed by it is also important to pay attention to the , there are also many speculative buys, so it is also important to pay attention to any reaction.

### Yarn and Cotton: Resumption of Stockpiling of 20s Count Lower Grade Yarn

The yarn market, which had been declining for days, suddenly rebounded yesterday. This kind of recovery was expected and not surprising. However, although the actual demand situation was active, the buying volume from each firm was weak, so confidence was not greatly increased. Hong Kong firms absorbed nearly 100 bales of coarse yarn, but the demand for fine yarn remained stagnant. However, some wealthy firms believed that 20s count yarn selling for less than 650 yuan, was inexpensive since the profit margin for cotton fabrics mills were not that high, so the intention to stockpile reappeared.  The number of buyers increased slightly, and the market recovered again. After closing, the spot price of 20s count Double Horse yarn was 725 yuan.

The opening of the spot yarn market in the morning was mediocre and showed a scattered and weak image. The opening price continued to fall by 7 yuan. The spot price of Double Horse was 702 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 686 yuan. As for the coarse yarn, there was a slight demand from Hong Kong firms, and the market situation was stable.

This firm has always had a large amount of stock, and it is unknown why they are selling now. The highest price of 20s count Double Horse was 725 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 705 yuan, an increase of 23 yuan over the opening spot price. It is estimated that 1,260 bales were traded in half a day. The market price of 20s count Double Horse rose by 13 yuan, Double Globe rose by 11 yuan, and Tiannv rose by 22 yuan. There were 55 pieces of export cotton yarn shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount bought by each firm is listed on the left.

### Factory Purchases Increase; Tonghua Cotton Sells Out Immediately

Cotton transactions have greatly improved. Japanese factories are actively purchasing. Factories such as Inner-Outer, Nichihua, and Huadong have purchased approximately 3,000 bales of white-packaged, Tongzhou and Huoji cotton. Huachang Xinyu has purchased 2,000 bales of Huoji cotton. Given the growing demand from manufacturers, industry insiders are eager to procure even more. The white-packaged cotton business has seen a sudden surge. Although market prices were initially predicted to decline this morning, due to recent congestion at arrival points, factories took the opportunity to act, reversing the downward trend. A total of 5,521 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived from Subei and were completely bought up by industry peers and both domestic and foreign factories, leaving no surplus. Based on observations of the market situation, foreign factories are actively purchasing, and further large-scale purchases are expected. Therefore, market prices are similar to those of the previous day. Additionally, 315 bales of grass cotton were shipped to Hong Kong from the docks. The current cotton sales situation is listed below:

In other news, foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai have recently seen a sharp decline in prices due to the sharp appreciation of foreign exchange. Factories have been observing this for several days. Yesterday, the Qingdao group seized the opportunity to make some purchases, but the quantity was very small. There has been significant congestion of goods arriving in recent days, with supply exceeding demand, causing prices to plummet. Foreign cotton has been negatively affected as a result, with prices falling significantly.

The foreign cotton market: The New York cotton market was quite firm in the morning. Telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai were positive, and market activity was brisk. There were also many industry players purchasing in the market. The practice of Southern groups selling short has also subsided. Spot trading has become more active, and the market has become more bullish. Closing prices rose by five to six points compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market, including forecasts, rose sharply by more than five rupees. Egyptian cotton rose by more than ten points, and Liverpool cotton rose by nine pence.

### Grains: Abundant Arrival of New Japonica Rice

Sales Prices Also Fell Sharply, Premium Native Rice Returns with Strength

Yesterday, various groups from downstream rivers arrived at South Port with a total of five to six thousand bags of Southern Port No. 2 and 3 and "Cartwheel" brand rice. Because the guest rice price reached the low end, most local merchants have purchased. The price of guest rice has increased by three to five corners. Other types, such as broken japonica and kiln-dried rice, as well as Baige and Luyang tip rice, remained stable due to similar supply and demand. New japonica rice arrivals were abundant, but demand was normal, causing prices to fall by half a yuan to one yuan. Specifically, Kai Changxi broken rice was priced at 32-33 yuan, middle grade at 30 yuan, and new japonica at 28-29 yuan. Suzhou Tongkun broken rice was priced at 30 yuan, and new japonica at 26-27 yuan. Qingjiao kiln-dried rice was priced at 29 yuan, Fengjia Baige at 27-28 yuan, Yang tip at 23 yuan, and lower grades at 21 yuan. Lu tip was priced at 23.5 yuan, and lower grades at 22 yuan. Jiangbei tip was priced at 18.1-2 yuan, and lower grades at 17.7 yuan. Wuhu special tip was priced at 19 yuan, and lower grades at 17.5 yuan. Broken tip was priced at 17 yuan, old grain at 31-32 yuan, and new grain at 26-27 yuan, also depreciated. Total market transactions amounted to more than 6,000 bags.

In other news, customer rice is still selling due to low prices. Domestic village groups and local shops, factories, and restaurants are taking advantage of low prices to buy, and transactions are becoming more and more lively. Scattered transactions totaled 6,400-500 bags. Although there are many stocks, shipments are also continuous. However, the current Shanghai price is only 17-18 yuan, broken rice is about 16 yuan, and brown rice is about 15 yuan. This price is no longer in line with the cost of production, and many new transactions by vendors have been halted. Major dealers and Japanese merchants are also unwilling to sell at low prices again. Therefore, after a smooth purchase by customers, the market immediately rebounded by two to three corners, which is the opposite of the sluggish and declining sales of japonica rice.

### Active Flour Sales

The flour market continues to rise. Although the price of No. 2 flour from factories has not increased, the return of goods has gradually improved, mainly because of the continuous sales from both northern and southern customers, who inquire about small quantities. Cannon brand flour is especially favored by the Qingdao group, and it is on par with factory prices. Other brands of returned goods are also priced higher because there are fewer chips in the market, and warehouses are no longer in a hurry to sell. Total market transactions continued at more than 40,000 bags. Factory prices remained at 7 yuan, and Cannon brand and Red-Blue Fuxin brand prices were 6.95-9 yuan. Battleship brand was priced at 6.75-8 yuan. It is reported that the Japanese Phoenix brand flour has also increased at the same time, with the October price required to be 6.55-6 yuan.

The wheat market continues to tighten. Arrivals from various places have been weak in recent days, and production prices have not loosened. In addition, the flour market is firm, and sellers intend to call for higher prices. However, factory warehouses are not selling as smoothly as desired. Fufucorn and Fufeng factories sold 2,000 packages to Suzhou, Changshu, Changzhou, Yangzhou, Nanjing, etc., at a price of 9.86-6 yuan.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Rises Sharply, then Retreats Slightly

The soybean oil market has seen a scarcity of supply, with limited available chips on the table (approximately 1,000 barrels of barrelled oil and 2,000+ of boxed oil). Powerful warehouse owners are holding firm and refusing to sell. Generally, the market expects Kobe oil to reach a peak of 70 yuan. However, actual sales were sluggish yesterday, and market sentiment softened. Although prices fell by only two corners compared to the previous day, the overall trend remained more positive than negative. Yesterday, a total of 30 barrels of Kobe oil were sold at 60.8 yuan, 50 cases of Jiaozhou oil at 47.5 yuan, and 200 cans of Yantai canned oil at 63 yuan. Peanut oil also fell slightly by two corners. Hong Kong groups did not move. Only this street sold 200 cases of Jiaozhou oil at 57.8 yuan.

### Miscellaneous Grains: Beans and Sesame Shipped to South China

Today, a total of 420 bags of beans and 600 bags of sesame were shipped to Hong Kong. A total of 2,100 bags of beans and 1,800 blocks of soybean cake were shipped to Singapore.

The call loan rate of the Money Industry Association has returned to lower by three-tenths, calculated at 1.9 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.

Sugar: Reportedly 2,000 Packages Have Arrived: Yesterday's sugar market was weak due to a relaxation in foreign exchange rates, declining sharply again. The price in the Sugar Association was 24.5 yuan less for current-month group goods, while the price for the book was 48 yuan. The initial price for foreign goods was 48.5 yuan, which tightened up slightly to 49 yuan later on, while transshipment goods were 37 to 37.25 yuan.

Shima and Tongan Longan Will Arrive Soon: Regarding Shima's new longan, it is said that a batch will arrive by Jinan ship today or tomorrow. However, because transportation is very difficult, the number will be small. It is also heard that Tongan goods will be transferred from Xiamen to Shanghai, with high costs. When the price is opened at that time, it may be difficult to return to the smaller price.

Indian Bituminous Coal is Still Firm: Although briquette coal has recently been allowed to extend, reducing costs, because there are few arrivals and strong sales, the market is still strong. 56,000 tons of Indian bituminous coal arrived last month, of which 30,000 tons were used by the power company, and the remaining two 20,000 tons were divided among the local industry players. Therefore, the owners are reluctant to sell easily. In the industry, lump coal is 108 yuan per ton, and retail from the store is 112 yuan per ton, 14 yuan per basket.

White Filature Decreased by 50 Yuan: The international silk market saw a turnaround yesterday with the US silk market.

### Amidst the Great Victory in Northern Hunan, Chinese Troops Have Advanced to the Outskirts of Shanghai; Japanese Tanks Rushed to Qingpu to Engage; Chinese Regular Troops Active Near Hongqiao; Guerrilla Units in Pudong Preparing to Counterattack

After weeks of fierce fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops in Northern Hunan, Japanese casualties exceeded tens of thousands, forcing them to declare the abandonment of their attempt to occupy Changsha. Hearing this good news in the guerrilla areas of the Southeast, with the crisp autumn air and well-fed troops, they are sharpening their weapons to create further victories. Therefore, the Japanese troops between Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, already exhausted, feel increasingly unable to cope. Meanwhile, the Chinese guerrilla units are in high spirits, their steadfastness matching the proud spirit of autumn chrysanthemums. Recently, Chinese regular troops have been pouring into the guerrilla areas, welcomed by millions of civilians with food and drink, their enthusiasm is extremely high. As a result, Chinese troops have become more active in the outskirts of Shanghai. Details are as follows:

Chinese Regular Troops Arrive at the Outskirts of Shanghai

The sound of gunfire was very dense in the area east of Pudong on the morning of the previous day. Around 9:00 AM, Japanese tanks passed one after another westward through the Hongqiao Aerodrome. However, after the Japanese tanks headed to Qingpu, the sound of gunfire resumed south of Hongqiao Road. According to Shanghai locals, this was because Chinese regular troops had already arrived in the area and were taking action. In the afternoon, Japanese tanks and trucks full of infantry suddenly rushed east again.

The English-language "China Press" reported that after heavy gunfire was heard in the Qingpu area this morning (the 12th), Japanese tanks passed westward through the Hongqiao Aerodrome around 9:00 AM, returning only after more than two hours. It is not clear whether these tanks fired, but gunfire occurred near Hongqiao Village after each vehicle passed westward. This location is south of Hongqiao Road, several miles after where the tanks passed. It is said that the gunfire near Hongqiao Village was from Chinese regular troops. Shortly after noon, gunfire was again heard in the Qingpu area, and Japanese tanks and trucks carrying infantry rushed back to Qingpu Road.

Pudong Guerrilla Units to Counterattack

In the summer of the year, the Japanese army's "mopping-up" operation against the guerrilla units in the three counties of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha in Pudong once forced them to retreat and gather in coastal areas, from Fengxian to Nanhui's Nicheng, reaching Chuansha along the Yiqin Public Embankment, forming a completely coastal area, separated by the embankment, creating a natural divide. The Japanese army was unable to advance, and the standoff continued to this day. After strengthening their equipment, the guerrilla units have taken a counteroffensive stance. According to locals, the guerrilla units have recently crossed this border line like a general offensive, with a large part of the puppet "Self-Defense Corps" defecting, impacting the situation. Currently, the guerrilla units in Fengxian have reached areas such as Yanfu Lane and the Taihe Japanese Bridge, while those in Nanhui have occupied Hengmian, recovered Lujiahui, and are close to Zhoupu. The northern half of Shangchuan Road up to Gaojiahang is controlled by the guerrilla units.

Situation Serious in Dinghai City

According to a recent traveler from Dinghai to Shanghai, after fierce fighting broke out outside the East Gate of Dinghai, a bomb suddenly exploded in front of the entrance of Tongshoutai Wine Shop (operated by Chen Er Mei, the "Chairman of the Autonomous Committee" of Dinghai) around 11:00 PM on the 29th of last month. The deafening sound shook the area far and wide. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese troops in the city immediately closed the city gates and prepared for strict defense, only sending a team to investigate the following morning. They found that the area of the bomb explosion was quite large, and the surrounding roads were also heavily damaged. Next to it were multiple colored leaflets from the "Youth Iron Blood Anti-Traitor Corps," with the content briefly stating a warning to those participating in certain organizations (hoping that they would turn back and repent). The "Chairman of the Autonomous Committee" Chen Sanmei issued a leaflet after the incident, explaining that he was forced to participate and requesting forgiveness. The "Vice-Chairman" Shen Songneng fled the city, and many others also left, causing a situation of extreme terror. In recent days, because Japanese soldiers fear attacks by guerrilla units, they have added artillery fortresses and strictly inspected residents entering and leaving, detaining anyone suspected, making the situation extremely serious.

### Cultural Figures Raise Money for Winter Clothing, Payment Methods

Directly Send Payment to Collection Points by Recognized Individuals

The local cultural, educational, and student communities have been conducting their respective winter clothing donation drives since yesterday. The students in universities and middle schools responsible for this work are particularly dedicated, and their results are expected to be considerable. The original plan was to collect the raised funds by community, then pool and remit them to the general association. To reduce the collection procedures, a new method has been decided: recognized individuals can directly deliver the funds to the National Bank, the "Ta Kung Pao," or the "China Press," which can also collect the funds. If the amount is large, it is even better if the recognized individuals can directly remit it to the general association.

### No Anomalies in Area A North of the Suzhou Creek

Although the Japanese forced vaccination in Area A north of the Suzhou Creek has ended, there are still no restrictions on entering or leaving the area. At the same time, the Japanese have not implemented household registration checks for residents in the area. However, Japanese troops patrol each section of the area from time to time, and the inspection of passes at the barbed wire fence gaps at the end of North Jiangxi Road has become stricter than before. In addition, before the Japanese took over the defense of the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazilu Road, British troops had positions there. Since the Japanese took over the defense, the British troops' positions have been withdrawn, and the Japanese have not set up positions there either. Scavengers residing in Zhabei who do not have passes often steal withered branches and burnt wood they pick up from under the barbed wire fence and smuggle them into the concession for sale, causing frequent damage to the barbed wire fence. At 4:00 PM yesterday, a Japanese plainclothes soldier used a whip to beat the scavengers, and the unknowing scavengers still attempted to smuggle withered branches and burnt wood there, all suffering beatings from the Japanese soldiers and running away holding their heads. A newly posted sign prohibiting vehicles from passing has been affixed to the Japanese sentry box at the gap at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Wenjianshi Road, but bicycles are not included. At the gap at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, vehicles can freely enter and exit.

### American Chamber of Commerce Cables Washington, States Views on Neutrality Act, Hopes New Clauses Will Be Added Before Passage, American Ships Continue to Navigate to Far East Ports

The Continental Daily reports that the American Chamber of Commerce in this city, fearing that the Pittman Neutrality Act amendment proposed by the American Senator would cause losses to American shipping to certain ports in the Far East if passed, telegraphed the US State Department in Washington yesterday (the 11th), stating the views of the American Chamber of Commerce on this matter. According to news obtained last night, the American Chamber of Commerce pointed out in the cable that if the Pittman bill is passed in its current form, the commercial interests of the United States in China and even other ports in the Far East will ultimately be severely harmed. The American Chamber of Commerce also expressed the views of American businessmen in this city, advocating that the Pittman bill should be modified to allow American ships to continue to navigate to ports in the Far East that belong to belligerent countries but are not actually in a war zone for a long time. No further news was obtained last night regarding the American Chamber of Commerce's action, but it was heard that the telegram sent to the US State Department had been approved by the entire American Chamber of Commerce in this city. According to the bill that has been submitted to the US Senate, the original plan is to restrict American ships from sailing to war zones. According to the provisions of the bill, the US President has the power to designate war zones that restrict American shipping. Although the general feeling is that the US President does not intend to designate the Pacific as a war zone, the Shanghai American Chamber of Commerce believes that one should not take chances and should add new clauses before the bill is passed. If the Pacific regions are designated as war zones, Shanghai and Tianjin will also be among the cities that restrict American shipping, which is foreseeable. Therefore, the American Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the State Department yesterday, stating everything.

### Japanese Newspaper Claims Shanghai Has a Communist Organization, Falsely Accuses Concession Authorities of Being Deceived, Claims Soviet Union Organized Russian Emigrant Affairs Bureau, Both Concession Authorities Deny Existence of Such Organization

The Continental Daily reports that the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" "discovered" that Shanghai has a Soviet "Communist organization" and that the police departments of the two concessions have been misled by the mysterious clouds of the organization. The "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" made a second attack yesterday, hyping up this non-existent threat.

Red Conspiracy Envelops White Russians

According to the newspaper, White Russian immigrants in Shanghai are now facing new threats due to the increase in Jewish immigrants. Moscow still pretends to promote the welfare of White Russians, but in reality, the red shadows of Moscow's conspiracy have enveloped Shanghai's 50,000 White Russians. This threat is in the name of the "Russian Emigrant Affairs Bureau," the name of which is the same as the agency established in "Manchukuo" and North China to take care of the affairs of White Russian immigrants. In reality, the "Russian Emigrant Affairs Bureau" is a "Soviet government outpost."

Preparing to Carry Out Communist Movement

The bureau was established after 11 members of the Soviet Consulate General in Shanghai returned to Moscow at the end of last month, and the 11 people who returned to Moscow were the ones who planned to establish the bureau. The bureau aims to win the sympathy of anti-communist White Russians and carry out "other large-scale communist movements," such as political and economic espionage, etc.

Attempting to Ban White Russian Organizations

The "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" did not disclose the location of the headquarters of this "Red threat," but continued to state that the first step taken by the Russian Emigrant Affairs Bureau was to try to ban the White Russian Emigrant Association and the Ukrainian Emigrant Committee, which oppose the Soviet Union, and has requested the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the Council of Directors of the French Concession to close the two organizations. However, neither the Municipal Council nor the Council of Directors has taken action. When reporters inquired with the Municipal Council and the Council of Directors yesterday, they learned that neither bureau was aware of the existence of this organization. Both bureaus firmly denied that any organization or individual had consulted with the two bureaus to ban the above-mentioned two White Russian emigrant organizations. According to the two bureaus, the number of 50,000 White Russian emigrants mentioned in the "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" is an exaggeration, as White Russian emigrants only number about half that amount.

### Shanghai West Puppet Police Search, Find Nothing

The actions of the Japanese puppets in the area of ​​roads built outside the boundary are unpredictable. Following the puppet police, there is also the emergence of so-called "special agents" and "Self-Defense Corps," making the situation more complicated. Residents are all confused and uneasy. After slogans and leaflets were discovered on National Day, the puppet police searched extensively, but found nothing. Yesterday, on Roberts Road, Caojiadu, Jessfield Road, Brenan Road, and the Zhaofeng Garden area, other slogans suddenly appeared on roadside poles.

### Overseas Chinese Set Up Paper Mill in Shanghai

Guanghua Paper Company Opens

Although the European war between Germany and Poland has come to an end, the various foreign goods in this city have not fallen in price. Even for newspapers alone, it still costs about 20 yuan per ream. Mr. Lin Shu'an, an overseas Chinese from the Philippines, recently recognized that there is a shortage of paper materials in Shanghai, and that paper prices are extremely high, affecting the printing and news industries greatly. He specially gathered more than 100,000 yuan to establish the Guanghua Chuanji Paper Manufacturing Joint Stock Company at No. 80 Jintai Lane, Singapore Road, in this city. It officially opened yesterday, with Mr. Yuan Ludeng unveiling the plaque. More than 100 guests, including Lin Kanghou and reporters from various newspapers, were present. The general managers of the factory, Lin Zaimou and Guo Zhenyuan, personally led them on a tour of the factories. The factory currently has more than 20 factory buildings, covering an area of ​​more than ten acres. Due to the initial startup, the factory currently produces only about 100 to 150 reams of paper per day, all of which are gray newsprint and wrapping paper. It will take some time to add equipment before they can also produce rough-edged paper, Lian Shi paper, and white newsprint, etc., so that the book and newspaper industries in Shanghai, where foreign exchange is scarce and foreign goods are in short supply, do not have to buy foreign goods at excessively high prices, thereby revitalizing domestic goods.

### Belgian Ambassador to China Discusses, Explains Belgian Position, Believes Belligerents Will Respect Neutrality, Refutes All Rumors of External Threats

According to a statement issued by the Belgian Embassy in China, Belgian Prime Minister Pierlot recently made remarks to reporters from Belgian newspapers regarding the attitude taken by the Belgian government in the current situation, stating that Belgium firmly believes in the solemn promises made by the belligerents to respect Belgium's neutrality and reaffirming Belgium's determination to adhere to the commitments it has acceded to. The Prime Minister also urged journalists to pay attention to the soundness of Belgium's military and financial strength. Public opinion in Belgium, which was originally tense, has now greatly eased and expressed increased confidence in Belgium's neutrality. Belgian officialdom unanimously confirmed this trend and refuted all rumors of external threats.

### Japanese Restrict Portuguese Vessels from Changing Nationality, Japanese Consul Notifies Portuguese Consul Not Allowed to Change Ownership, but Says Sale to Chinese or Japanese Merchants Not Opposed

Since April 8th of this year, more than a dozen Portuguese vessels belonging to the Mei Li Company (Metta), the Huamei Company (Tangbei, Tangqiao, Tanglu), the Zhengde Company (Lishi), the Atlantic Company (Hailong), the American Shipping Company (Fulu), and the diesel-powered splint ships Baode, Lude, and Fade, were illegally detained by the Japanese Navy at foreign merchant locations in eastern Zhejiang and at the Wusongkou, and were forced to moor at the Yangshupu river buoy. The former Portuguese Consul General to Shanghai, Alves, and the current Consul General, Melo, have repeatedly negotiated, but the Japanese have consistently made excuses and postponed the return of the vessels. During this period, personnel from the puppet "Ministry of Transport's Shipping Administration Bureau" approached the shipping merchants to persuade them, saying that as long as they registered with the "Bureau," the vessels would be returned. However, the Portuguese merchants ignored this, so the case has remained unresolved to this day.

Restricting Vessels from Changing Nationality

Reporters from Dagong News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the Japanese detention of a large number of Portuguese vessels and a small number of German and Italian merchant ships is clearly aimed at coveting ownership and intending to buy them. Recently, some Portuguese merchants planned to sell their vessels to shippers of third countries because the vessels had been detained for a long time, the issue has not been resolved, and the losses are not small. However, the Japanese consulate expressed opposition to this, suddenly notifying the Portuguese consulate that the detained Portuguese vessels were not allowed to change ownership or nationality, but if they were sold to Japanese or Chinese merchants, there would be no objection. From this, the intentions of the Japanese are already very clear.

Deyao Intends to Return Vessel to Japanese Merchant

The Portuguese vessel Deyao, represented by the Italian Yihua Foreign Firm in this city, was loaded with goods from Beisha Qinglong Port on the morning of the 6th and was detained by the Japanese Maritime Military Police commanding the puppet police. Afterwards, the Japanese side sent workers to paint over the two characters "Deyao" of the ship's name. The company immediately reported the matter to the Portuguese consulate to inquire about the reason for the ship's detention in order to negotiate. According to reports yesterday from the Dagong News Agency reporters to the company, the cargo loaded on the Deyao vessel had been unloaded, and the ship's name had been repainted by the Japanese after they painted it over. However, there are still two Japanese on board guarding the ship. The Japanese consulate actually notified the Portuguese consul yesterday that the vessel had been reassigned to a Japanese merchant and had been notified to the Maritime Military Police to return the vessel to the Japanese Tianli Foreign Firm, etc. The Portuguese consulate expressed opposition to this and is now inquiring as to who sold the vessel to the Japanese merchant and requesting to examine the bill of sale to verify it. As of last night, the Deyao vessel was still docked at Lujiazui and had not moved.

### Chinese and Foreign Relief Society Going to Hong Kong to Raise Funds

Establishing Branches Everywhere, Board Meeting to be Held Today

The Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Society has been actively handling disaster relief in various places recently, establishing branches everywhere. The branches in Tianjin, Bengbu, and other places have been established recently. After the Society decided to expand the scope of disaster relief for the North China floods, it has decided to send the Director-General, Mr. Ou Yongkang, to Hong Kong to raise funds. Mr. Ou is scheduled to leave Shanghai around the 20th of this month. After arriving in Hong Kong, he will discuss with the Chairman in Hong Kong, Song Hanzhang, and Directors Du Yuesheng and Wang Xiaoji to promote the fund-raising affairs. The Society is scheduled to hold a continued board meeting at its office on Renji Road today to approve continued funding for Bengbu, Xianhu, Anqing, Huai'an, and other places. In addition, due to the increasing complexity of disaster relief, the Society has specially hired Tan Neng, Zhu Yinwang, and Li Guiyong to join the Disaster Relief Division.

### National Construction Savings Certificates for Thrift - Issuance Imminent - Principal and Interest Fully Guaranteed - Redeemable After Six Months

In order to encourage national savings and promote national construction, the National Government, after promulgating the National Construction Savings Certificate Regulations for Thrift last month, has instructed the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to prepare for issuance. More than 1,000 post offices in the Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang branch bureaus, and the Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Guangdong, Hubei, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi areas will uniformly sell these certificates. To ensure smooth implementation, the General Savings and Remittance Bureau has dispatched special commissioners to various regional branch bureaus to provide guidance and assistance. This savings certificate is superior and more convenient than ordinary savings, embodying the idea of saving to save the country. In addition to the direct responsibility of the postal service, the principal and interest are also guaranteed by the government, making it extremely secure. The savings certificates are divided into two types: Type A, which is registered and can be reported lost and reissued, and Type B, which is unregistered, cannot be reported lost, and can be freely transferred or gifted. The denominations are five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, one hundred yuan, five hundred yuan, and one thousand yuan, totaling six categories. The deposit period is set at a maximum of ten years, but Type A certificates can be redeemed at any time after six months at more than 1,000 post offices nationwide, making them similar to ordinary current savings, while the interest is far superior to that of current accounts. Type B savings certificates require specifying the storage period at the time of purchase. According to news from the local Savings and Remittance Bureau, these savings certificates will be issued soon. Based on the usual development of postal savings, it is predicted that this national construction savings program for thrift will receive widespread participation, which is extremely important for both personal savings and national construction.

At 7:30 AM on July 7th of this year, Hua Pu No. 1819 of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, along with another Hua Pu, was searching two Chinese men near the Xinzha Bridge Road when they were suddenly attacked by two other gangsters who opened fire. They immediately returned fire. The three bandits then fled west along the Xinzha Road. The Hua Pu immediately gave chase, with No. 1819 bravely taking the lead. When they reached the corner of Chengdu Road, Western probation patrol officer Boxston joined the chase. One bandit fled into a lane, drawing a gun to shoot at the patrol officer, but the patrol officer and Hua Pu No. 1819 fired simultaneously, wounding him. Another accomplice was also shot by the patrol officer, and the other bandit jumped into the Suzhou Creek and drowned. The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department Awards Committee, considering the two officers to be loyal, diligent, and brave, and worthy of commendation, has been approved by the Council to award each of them a Second Class Medal for Special Police Merit in order to encourage and commend them.

### Rice Prices Plummet for Days - Top Grade Rice Already Sold at Twenty-Nine Yuan - The Inevitable Trend of Soaring Prices Followed by a Sharp Decline

New rice from rice-producing areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hunan is abundant and is being continuously shipped to Shanghai. New rice from Jing, Wu, and Jiangbei is still being transported. With the influx of new rice from all directions, buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude and dare not inquire. The market is flooded with spot goods, resulting in oversupply and sluggish sales. The rice market has been in a slump for days, with a series of sharp declines. The price of the best white rice had previously broken the 45 yuan mark but has now plummeted to 29 yuan. In the past two weeks, the price of the best white rice has seemed to fall by about 16 yuan. Currently, the supply is increasing, and the market sentiment remains bearish. The revised temporary trading rules for the rice shops tea party market, which were decided to be implemented from the 16th, were announced yesterday. The details are as follows:

New Goods Arrive in Droves - Stocks are Abundant

Rice stocks in Shanghai rice warehouses are gradually becoming abundant. The Bean and Rice Industry Association continues to send personnel to be responsible for the investigation, and to report weekly to the authorities of the two concessions and the seven rice industry groups for reference. According to the association's investigation, the rice stocks in various rice warehouses have doubled in the past week. Yesterday, a total of two boats from the Southern Port gang arrived at the river, and 5,000 to 6,000 bags were loaded from Kunshan, Tongli, Jiashan, Fengjing and other places. The market opened at 9:00 AM, with more than 8,000 bags of rice registered for sale. Sales were initially brisk but later turned sluggish. As a result, old rice and new japonica rice fell by one yuan, and the best white rice sold for 29 yuan. A total of more than 8,000 bags were sold in the morning. According to rice industry observers, the price of japonica rice and other goods will continue to fall within days.

Trading Rules - Announced and Implemented

The temporary trading rules for the Rice Shop Association Tea Party Market were revised and passed on November 2nd by a joint meeting of representatives of the seven rice industry groups. From now on, both buyers and sellers in the market must trade in spot goods and must not sell short in order to regulate the people's food supply and must not engage in irregular transactions. Yesterday, the market management committee notified the representatives of various shops and hotels and decided to implement the rules from the 16th of this month. The announcement of the Bean and Rice Industry Association is excerpted as follows: "It is hereby announced that the Association convened a joint meeting of rice industry groups on February 2nd and revised and passed the temporary trading rules of the Rice Shop Association Market according to the draft prepared by the Market Management Committee and decided to implement them from the 16th of this month. In addition to printing the rules separately and distributing them to the Market Management Committee, the market is hereby announced, hoping that everyone will abide by them. This is most important. This is hereby announced, with a copy of the rules attached."

### Lace and Ramie Cloth - Request Exemption from Foreign Exchange Settlement for Shipment to Shanghai

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs to request exemption from foreign exchange settlement for the shipment of lace and ramie cloth to Shanghai for sale: (1) Respectfully to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Chongqing, according to the lace embroidery industry, lace is a handicraft industry of rural women, which should be promoted during the extraordinary period after the war to encourage production. Ordering the Zhejiang Customs to require foreign exchange settlement will inevitably increase costs, affect sales, and affect the livelihood of civilians in the rear. Please order the customs to exempt women-made lace from Xiaoshan from foreign exchange settlement for transportation and sale, which would be beneficial to the public. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce kowtows, Zhen. (2) Respectfully to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Chongqing, Shen Kangxiang Company sold ramie cloth from Jiangxi to Shanghai. The Ministry approved a quota of 300,000 yuan for exemption from foreign exchange settlement. Now, there are more than 460 additional pieces, worth more than 25,000 yuan, but the Zhejiang Customs refuses to release them, citing the Ministry's order for foreign exchange settlement. The exemption from foreign exchange settlement has not exceeded the quota, but the government orders have changed suddenly, causing extreme distress to businesses. Sincerely imploring your departments to quickly issue an order to the Zhejiang Customs to release the goods without foreign exchange settlement according to the previous quota, I will be eternally grateful to the public. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce kowtows, Zhen.

### Financial Stability - Interbank Loan Rates Fall Yesterday

The interbank loan rate in the money market fell by 3 points yesterday to 19 points, which means that the daily interest rate per thousand yuan is 19 points. Before the war, the interbank loan rate would reach the top level of 70 points at the end of the tenth period. Generally, the highest interbank loan rate is 70 points. Before the abolition of taels and the introduction of yuan, it was 70 qian, and it could not exceed this limit no matter how tight the market was.

### Post Office Temporarily Suspends - Parcels to Various Parts of Northern Jiangsu

Due to the recent activities of Japanese troops in various cities and counties in northern Jiangsu, the resumption of war, resulting in blocked transportation and postal difficulties, the Shanghai Postal Administration, in addition to making every effort to clear the postal transportation in the area, has successively suspended the acceptance of heavy parcels.

### Second Batch of Cent Coins - Printed in Twenty Days - Same Style and Paper as the First Batch - Entrusted to Trade Associations for Distribution

After the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank issued one-cent and five-cent coins, in order to prevent hoarding, it adopted a gradual issuance system.

The bank has reviewed them and approved them based on actual needs to facilitate circulation. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the Central Bank yesterday that 400,000 yuan of the first batch of 500,000 yuan has been issued, and the issuance will be completed soon. The second batch of 500,000 yuan, after the head office instructed the Hong Kong office to sign a printing contract with the American Wing On Company in Hong Kong, stipulated that the printing and delivery should be completed within 20 days from the date of signing the contract. After the printing is completed, it will be transported to Shanghai and delivered to the bank for continued issuance. The style and paper are exactly the same as the first batch. The issuance method for the second batch will be improved, and various industries will entrust trade associations to distribute them to the public. The reserve for the issuance of cent coins will be handled in accordance with the government's previously promulgated regulations on the issuance of subsidiary coins.

At about 8:15 PM last night, Jiu Ru Hiji Money Exchange at 84 Seward Road in eastern Shanghai was suddenly broken into by a gangster speaking Baobo, Zhenjiang, and local dialects. Five people held firearms and sharp weapons. They locked up the staff and apprentices in the back room of the shop, assigned two or four people to guard them with guns, and threatened the accountant to hand over the key to the silver box, stealing a large amount of national currency, US dollars, and Japanese currency, totaling about 130,000 yuan. After the robbery, the robbers took two cars and sped away eastward. Fortunately, no one was injured. Afterwards, the manager of the shop issued a loss report and reported it to the Hongkou police station for investigation.

### Barber's Wife - Abducted and Forced into Prostitution - Fellow Townsman Reports for Extortion - Arrested by Police - Principal Culprit Apprehended and Awaiting Trial

Jiang, the wife (20 years old) of Zhao Mingfu, a Yangzhou native (a barber), residing at 299 Xiaoshadu Road, is slightly beautiful. She has been married to Zhao for four years. Recently, because Zhao is in the autumn of high prices in the rice and pearl market, it is impossible to maintain expenses, so his wife Jiang had to go to a certain

Mansion as a Servant

In Yuyuan Road. However, she was young and ignorant of the dark secrets of Shanghai's bad people. On the 2nd of this month, she was lured by Chen Changgui, a fellow townsman and barber residing at 114 Beihe Road, Hongkou, who told her that a Japanese family at 41 Jingyang Lane, 74 Pei Er Road, wanted to hire a maid with a high salary and could go for an interview. She should not miss this opportunity. She believed him and happily went to the place with Chen. As soon as she entered the door, she could not escape. It turned out to be a place that was

A Brothel

Chen had already made arrangements with the brothel owner, received the money, and slipped away. Zhao Jiang was forced to sell herself by the madam of the brothel and began a life of misery. When Zhao Ming found that his wife had disappeared from the employer's home, he asked people to look for her everywhere, but there was no news. Until about 11:00 AM on the 11th, a fellow townsman,

A Barber

Named Zheng Ligen, came to his home and said, "I have found that your wife Jiang is staying somewhere in Hongkou. You need to pay 30 yuan and I can send her back." Zhao Ming heard this and realized that his wife had been abducted and extorted. He secretly reported to the Putuo Road police station, which dispatched detective Ma Guiliang to arrest him. It was learned that Chen Changgui, a fellow townsman, was the principal culprit. He was also apprehended at 140 Beihe Road. They also went to the brothel at 41 Pei Er Road to

Rescue Jiang

And brought her to the police station. She was taken back by her husband. Zheng Ligen and Chen Changgui were sent to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Attorney Li Zhishan of the police station recounted the case and requested investigation. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the two defendants and remanded them for further hearing and sentencing.

### Parricide by Ungrateful Son - Formally Indicted - Scheduled for Trial This Morning

Zhou Yongjie, a Ningbo native and former manager of the Fengtian branch of a certain pharmacy in this city, was killed and dismembered by his own sons, Qinji and Qinxiang, at about 2:00 AM on the 5th of this month at his residence at 288 Ai Yu Road, Haig Road, in an attempt to destroy the body. Fortunately, his daughter Qin Zhu discovered it and secretly reported it to the police station, who arrested Qinji, Qinxiang, and their mother Jing and handed them over to the First Special Court for trial and detention. The case will be continued this morning. It is reported that the police station has formally charged them with murder.

### Japanese Detective Arrested in Guanghanfang, Xiafei Road - Attempting to Kidnap a Person Named Chen

Chen Alin, a Haimen native, resides in a bungalow at 18 Guanghanfang, Xiafei Road, in the French Concession. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at about 4:00 PM, Chen's partner Zheng secretly reported to the Japanese military headquarters that Chen Alin had close ties with the guerrillas. The Japanese military headquarters immediately dispatched two Chinese detectives, accompanied by Zheng, directly to Chen's residence, intending to

Kidnap Chen

Privately. Unexpectedly, Chen had gone out and had not returned home. The two Chinese detectives dared to sit in Chen's residence and wait for Chen to return home. At that time, the neighbors noticed that the two men were behaving strangely and reported to the police station by telephone. The police station initially suspected that it was a case of robbery and dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives in patrol cars to the scene and arrested the two men on the spot. They then dispatched detectives to

Wait for Chen at Chen's Home

Until about 11:00 AM yesterday morning, two more men came and claimed to be sent by the

Japanese Military Headquarters

To arrest Chen. The two men even admitted that they were currently the directors of a certain department of the headquarters. However, when they realized that the two men waiting were detectives from the police station, the two men ran away. A detective ordered them to stop, but they refused. A detective fired a warning shot into the air. The two men stopped and were arrested and taken to the police station. The French Concession authorities attach great importance to this case because there have been kidnapping-style private arrests of residents in the concession in recent times. The case is now under serious investigation.

He was seen on Fuxu Road on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 11th) by another employee of the bureau, Wang Linzhi, who arrested him and handed him over to the Central Police Station. He was sent to the First Special Court Criminal Division 1 yesterday and requested detention. The presiding judge Qian Hongye presided over the hearing. The defendant Jin Futing insisted that the telegram fees were not embezzled but were robbed by robbers on Maigen Road. After the court verified the statements, he was remanded for further hearing in a week.

Japanese Soldiers Brutally Beat Chinese Woman

At about 2:00 PM yesterday, a Chinese woman, aged about 30 to 40, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and trousers, speaking with a northern accent, was stopped by a Japanese soldier when she was going from Zhabei to the concession. The Japanese soldiers beat her with gun butts and wooden sticks, causing her to suffer serious injuries all over her body. She was then forced to stand guard for a moment and then taken to the Japanese headquarters in the Traffic Bank warehouse. It is not known what happened to her. It is reported that the Chinese woman was beaten because she had iron objects on her person.

Robbery and Murder of Landlord

At about 11:00 PM the night before last (the 10th), more than a dozen bandits speaking mixed dialects suddenly broke into the home of Li Jingui, a farmer in Hongqiao Town, southwest of Shanghai. The entire Li family woke up from their dreams and were threatened by the bandits with guns and forbidden to make noise. They ransacked the house and searched at will. Li's niece, Xiuzhen (also known as A Da, 35 years old, the wife of the younger brother of Bao, a tea shop owner on Haig Road, Xujiahui, from Anhui), was visiting her sick brother. She was beaten and killed on the spot by the bandits. After getting the stolen goods, the bandits went north to the home of Yu Fuyuan, a farmer in Yu Jiatang (north of No. 5 Bridge on Qinghu Road), and robbed them. After half an hour, the bandits fled with their loot.

Cab Driver Sentenced for Causing Accident

Cai Weiting and Pan Wansheng, cab drivers from Tongzhou, were arrested for transporting scrap iron for the British Lighters Company and killing the child Yao Xuesi when they passed the Tibet Road Bridge at about 5:00 PM on the 4th of this month. The case has been concluded and they were sent to the Criminal Division 3 of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Judge Jiang sentenced Cai Weiting and Pan Wansheng to one year's imprisonment each for manslaughter.

Jishenghui Vaccination and Infant Care

The Chinese Jishenghui has always taken helping the poor and needy as its sacred duty. Therefore, no matter where it is, medical treatment and medicine are provided, and relief and assistance are carried out in parallel. With the spiritual treatment of the old lay Buddhist Zhu Qilu and the tireless dedication of Feng Yangshan, Zhang Lunqing, and others, the society's work has progressed and developed day by day. Since the summer medical treatment program began, many people have sought medical treatment. With the approach of autumn and winter, the society will begin vaccinating against smallpox and caring for infants.

### Letter

To whom it may concern:

We are writing on behalf of our clients, Venerable Yuehua, Abbot of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple, and Venerable Guanru (also known as Yangxi), Abbot of the Yu Huang Temple. According to them, yesterday's news section of your newspaper reported on a lost lawsuit over temple property, threats against lawyers, and that Gu Zhuxuan also received a threatening letter, leading to suspicion falling on Yangxi and others, resulting in their detention by the police and handwriting analysis, followed by release on bail. They claim that not only are these facts inaccurate, but your lawyer representative also sued Wu Boliang, a clerk from lawyer Zhu Qinong's office, and others for aiding the monk Qinliang, who bought temple property, impersonating detectives, illegally detaining monks and laypeople, and coercing them, filing charges of unlawful imprisonment, among other crimes. The lawsuit against lawyer Zhu and his associates for leading the invasion of the temple has not yet been added. Moreover, regarding the alleged threats against lawyers, they have never met Mr. Gu Zhuxuan and have no connection whatsoever. How could they drag in the philanthropist Mr. Gu out of hatred? Furthermore, the threatening letter was traced to 11 Jiangxi Road, and the name of Wu Boliang was not found in the letter. How could Wu Boliang lead detectives to the temple without asking the circumstances? After explaining the lawsuit to the police, they were allowed to return to the temple. Moreover, the board of directors of Leshan Temple and the affiliated Yu Huang Temple are still in litigation with the perpetrators Qinliang and Wu Boliang. How can it be said that they lost the lawsuit and made threats? This concerns their reputation. We believe that the reporter may have misheard the account. We request that your lawyer representative send a letter to your newspaper to publish a correction of the facts in the "Letters to the Editor" section. We would be grateful if your esteemed publication could publish the facts. We also extend our regards to the chief editor.

Sincerely,

Lawyer Liu Xiang, acting on behalf of,

October 7, Year 28

### The Bridal Sedan Chair Chai Yan

My younger sister recently got married, participating in a group wedding. Group weddings have become very fashionable in recent years, but the more realistic reason is to save money; most of those who participate in group weddings are probably "birds of a feather flocking together," right? The newspapers publish "During the National Crisis, Everything Should Be Simplified," but in reality, advertisements promoting the effect of "allowing the public to know" involve grand banquets at fancy restaurants with meals costing thirty yuan or more per table, and participants in group weddings are not included in that, are they?

However, in this way, the bride's right to sit in a bridal sedan chair is deprived. According to the customs of our village (Ningbo), the bridal sedan chair is originally regarded as extremely sacred. On the night before the auspicious day, the groom's family specially sets up a feast in front of the sedan chair to worship the sedan chair spirit when they “honor the ancestors” (always around 5 a.m.). Women are not allowed to touch the bridal sedan chair with their hands (it is said that women's hands are unclean, and washing them with scented soap won't get rid of it) to avoid angering the sedan chair spirit; if a woman accidentally steps over the sedan chair poles, it must be washed with sugar water, sincerely and fearfully; I don't know why the sedan chair spirit dislikes women so much, but the bridal sedan chair itself is specifically for women to ride in, and I don't know the contradiction between them. Moreover, I am even more confused as to why sugar water can dispel bad luck. I guess the sedan chair spirit probably likes to eat sugar, right?

Because the bridal sedan chair is so sacred and inviolable, the bride's marriage also takes riding in a bridal sedan chair as a matter of honor. The villagers' ability to pick on each other's weaknesses when quarreling is learned from the same master as Mr. Ah Q, so "the great-grandmother was carried in a bright red bridal sedan chair, the bridal sedan chair enters, the coffin exits, not like someone else's small green cloth sedan chair, a small boat..." has also become a magic weapon to defeat the enemy. When the other party hears the words "bridal sedan chair," even if they are not speechless, they are also awed. Therefore, to counterattack, either the same bridal sedan chair is used to flaunt one's status, or a new approach is taken, picking on other weaknesses to attack.

The use of the bridal sedan chair is very important, but getting actual enjoyment from it is not pleasant. The light is dim, the surroundings are tightly sealed, the air is not circulating, and to please the auspiciousness, you must also add a foot warmer with a fire in it, regardless of winter or summer. In addition to the phoenix coronet and embroidered cape, the bride's dress must also include a "grandmother's robe," and her face is covered with a red cloth "veil." That decoration is as bothersome as the "female hanging ghost" in the Mulian opera. I know too little about why there is such a strange dress; it is probably still related to the sedan chair spirit. Dressing up a bit ugly and covering the face is to avoid jealousy. During modern weddings, guests throw soybeans on the newlyweds (now it's changed to using red, green, and green confetti). It is said that the original intention is to dispel the ghosts who are jealous of the newlyweds. I never thought that the ghosts in China and foreign countries would be the same in this regard from ancient times to the present.

Although riding in a bridal sedan chair is not a pleasant thing, the brides in my hometown insist on being willing to taste this suffering. When the bridal sedan chair arrives in front of the hall, because it is not beautiful or new enough, some even rely on not being willing to get in the sedan chair. Of course, the solution is often that the parents and brothers personally promise to give more dowry. After getting in, those with weak bodies often vomit because of being smoked and bumped in this mobile dark room, and some even faint. Therefore, there are various guesses. Some say it is unclean and has offended the sedan chair spirit; some say it is bad luck and they are not blessed to enjoy it; the worst suspicion is that the bride had some unchaste behavior in her maiden's home, as if the sedan chair spirit is a full-time doctor specializing in examining the hymen. However, although the difficulties are numerous, they are willing to undergo this test. The only reason is that this is a "enjoyment" that only happens once in a lifetime. They say that even if you make millions, you can ride in cars and everything, but you can't ride in a bridal sedan chair again.

This reason may be correct, but because of the war, the authority of the sedan chair spirit has also declined. My younger sister's marriage without riding in a bridal sedan chair is an example.

However, without the progress of the war, the authority of the sedan chair spirit probably would not have declined so quickly, right? At least my younger sister would have wanted to ride in a bridal sedan chair, and the groom's family, to show face, would have had to let their new daughter-in-law "enter the door in a bridal sedan chair."

The anti-imperialist war actually includes the anti-feudal war. Resistance is nation-building. We should really thank the "warriors" who promoted the collapse of old China and the birth of new China.

### Chapter 16: Planning to Promote Medical Education and Establish Schools, Thinking of Expanding Village Governance and Entrusting Children with Something

Now it's different. Although it is a village, it is like an enlarged home and a miniature country. Every year, there is a certain amount of income and expenses, and there are budgets and final accounts. For example, a country has state-owned property and state-run enterprises. Their village is the same. They have village-owned property and village-run enterprises. Don't underestimate this free village. At this moment, they are not like they were in the past, with all kinds of donations and additional taxes that never end, causing people headaches. So, where does their village income come from? Don't they also have to run many businesses? The central government and the provincial government cannot subsidize local funds. You have to prepare for it yourself. Their income comes first from land rent. Because since this war, there has been a big change in the land across the country. All land cannot be privately owned. The land in the free village is publicly owned by the free village. If villagers want to use that land, they have to rent it from the village, and they have to pay a certain amount of rent every year. This rent is certainly not the same. The rent in prosperous areas cannot be the same as the rent in remote areas. The rent is estimated according to the situation of the place. Although land cannot be bought or sold, and land seems to have no price, the amount of rent is equal to the price of the land. However, the value of land fluctuates indefinitely, and the rent also rises and falls accordingly. Therefore, the public has established a land valuation committee. No matter where the land is, it must be valued once a year. This valuation is not to estimate the selling price, but to estimate the rental price. For example, in the free village, the previous rented land used to generate a certain amount of rent per mu per year, but now it has risen a lot, and it is more than just a certain amount of rent. This is a matter of course. The price of land in the whole of China only increases year by year and will never fall. Especially in the villages of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and especially in the free villages in the villages of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Because there are really too many people in the big cities everywhere now, I am thinking of dispersing them. For example, in a place like Shanghai, the population is so large and crowded that it inevitably causes many dangers. Therefore, we must try our best to disperse them, and the route of dispersion is naturally always towards the nearby places. Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces already have many cities, so they have gone to the villages everywhere. However, the villages are also different. Although the villages after the war are gradually developing, some have strict organizations, while others may not be well managed. It cannot be generalized, but like the free village, with Zhu Lao’s painstaking efforts in the past few years, even among the many villages between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it can be regarded as a modern model new village. 190

### Steamship (Anecdotes about Mechanical Poetry) Ru Hui

The scholar from Qiongjiang wrote one of his fifty "Shanghai Bamboo Branch Poems":

The Wusong estuary is lined with teeth, Forts were built to defend the sea in those years,

Since trade has been opened, they have all been removed, The steamship lightly rides the waves.

After the opening of the sea ban, steamships followed, which attracted the attention of poets, who regarded them with great amazement, like gas lamps, electric wires, and telegrams. According to Wang Tao's "Ying Qiao Miscellany," such ships could travel sixty or seventy li per hour, but poets saw it as a kind of shrinking land. The old owner of twenty-three houses wrote:

The Zhongjiang River is good, the steamship is ingenious. Turning the mill is like a lantern horse, embarking is as fast as an arrow leaving the string, traveling ten thousand miles is convenient.

He compared it to a "lantern horse" and an "arrow leaving the string," showing his astonishment. Due to this astonishment, poets inevitably thought of the relationship between the sexes. Therefore, the owner of the Wanxiang Li Mengshi wrote one of his four "North Shanghai Little Bamboo Branch Poems":

The return date is in early spring, but cool autumn has not yet arrived,

Looking at the steamship every morning, I want to send a letter of longing.

Calling it a "steamship" is very inappropriate, but at the time, there was no word "steamship." Wang Zhichun's "Lun Chuan Chu Yang" poem recorded in Volume 1 of "Tan Ying Lu" said it more scientifically:

Lightning strikes and thunder roars incessantly, The warship goes straight east with the water.

The silver waves break through, the wind howls like a horse, the iron armor seems to fly, the stars offend the bull.

The atmosphere rotates the wheel axis, the fox smoke sways, the sea and sky are autumnal,

The building ship was originally our thing, I will try another trip to the Stone City.

The middle two couplets are truly masterpieces. In addition, Wang Tao mentioned "warships" in his article on "steamships," but at the time, very few poets used "warships" in their poems, perhaps because sea battles had not yet occurred at that time, while "steamships" were closer to people's lives at the time. The only one I have seen is a chapter of "Military Song," which is found in the "Middle School Song Collection" written by Xin Han. The song says··

A central order shakes the mountains, the sea department has heavy military power. The general's flags are like clouds, and the warships surge forward. The gun positions are cold on the left and right sides, and the electric sound is loud. The searchlights are red at night, and the four countries are shocked by the power. The South China Sea and the Bohai Sea are linked together, and the diplomacy is smooth. Establish prestige and protect the country, and the boys are ambitious, the Pacific Ocean, is in trouble, brave the waves and wait for the time, the military officials do not hesitate to die! (1)

It is a pity that the whole army was defeated that day. When will this shame be erased? The navy is weak and it is difficult to defend the country, and other races bully urgently. The new Panama of America, the situation requires people to cut. Think of the oyster and bird fighting for dependence, how can you sit back and lose the fisherman's profit? The old empires are finally rising up, and the sea power is restoring the national prestige, and Jiang You is becoming more and more energetic! (2)

However, this was also written after the defeat of Japan in the Sino-Japanese War in 1894-95. "The Pacific Ocean is in trouble," decades ago, the Pacific Ocean was full of crises, but I never thought that decades later, its tense situation has not eased a bit. As for the shame of the whole army's failure, the day of washing it away is near, because in this war, our country will eventually be on the victorious side.

A Path to Self-Destruction

The soaring prices in Shanghai, and the hoarding by speculators, are of course the biggest reasons, especially after the outbreak of the war in Europe. However, the opportunistic profiteering of ordinary merchants and the blindly raising prices is also a reason. This abnormal development, although it can profit for a while by relying on the special circumstances of the "isolated island," in reality, what will happen to the war in Europe, and whether the general residents can bear such a heavy burden, recent facts have clearly broken the wishful thinking of those speculators and blind merchants.

For example, a certain company's advertisement warned customers to ship their goods immediately because the flour was rotten. From this advertisement, we can clearly understand how cruel those speculative merchants are. When the price of rice soared and residents used flour as a substitute, they hoarded a large amount of flour, and as a result, the price of flour gradually rose. But now that the new grains are on the market, the source is smooth, and the price of rice has fallen to about 30 yuan, and high-quality rice is sold for 18 yuan, those who hoard foreign goods are also losing money. —This is really the best lesson for speculators!

As for ordinary merchants, they also raised their prices under the pretext of foreign exchange and sources, but those goods even have nothing to do with foreign exchange and sources. In addition to being exploited by this general purchase (and trying their best to save money), other savings have been saved, and they really cannot afford to increase the burden. Therefore, increasing prices is indeed the freedom of merchants, and those who are directly affected are also themselves—that is, the sales of all goods have plummeted. The lesson of this fact also made them realize that all speculation and tricks are a path to self-destruction.

In the call to promote the reorganization of commercial ethics, I hope that merchants will look further ahead, and there should be a limit to making profits. Even if everyone is heartless and doesn't talk about "commercial ethics," the "plummeting sales" is the best ironclad proof of hitting oneself in the foot! (Tianwen)

### The Private Life of Mei Lanfang (1) Li Feishu, Miscellaneous Memories from the American Border, No. 6

Drama emphasizes the "Three Unities," and I, a humble writer, also have my "Three Unities." First: if I don't attend a gathering, I don't write; second: if my leather trunk isn't empty, I don't write; third: if I don't get close to women, I don't write. If I attend a gathering, then I can write a thousand words, ready at a moment's notice. If my leather trunk is empty, then my wife and children are crying for food, waiting for rice to be cooked, making me unable to bear not to write, to exchange writing for money and rice. If I get close to women, then my whole body feels relieved, and my mind is exceptionally clear, the effect of which is no less than that of "red bean lanterns and rice flower."

If I hadn't attended the gathering and received the manuscript fee, and if my yellow-faced wife hadn't fallen slightly ill, then, because of this, "Miscellaneous Memories from the American Border" would have died young! I trouble the editor to make a special trip, probably to urge me to write. Even if it's not to urge me to write, I would still say it is. Because, in the minds of us poor writers, the editor holds the power of selection and rejection, and their position is as lofty as that of the examiners in the imperial examinations of the past. Although it is an ordinary visit, I can use it to emphasize my own importance. Saying that he came to urge me to write can invisibly increase the value of my articles. Don't you see, "Following Premier Sun Yat-sen for many years" and "My friend Hu Shi," these two simple sentences have made many revolutionary heroes and literary giants!

My "Three Unities" have expired. Moreover, I am especially favored by the editor, so I urgently write this to repay their kindness.

The topic and outline had already been prepared for two articles. One is a collection of travel impressions from Japan. It just so happens that my teachers and friends warned me to be careful when writing articles! Don't speak carelessly, and don't get involved in any political suspicions. However, they think too highly of me! How am I worthy to talk about politics? However, living in this turbulent world, especially on an isolated island, it is better to be cautious when writing! Didn't Mr. Zhu Xinggong "fail to live up to his youthful head"? Forgive me for being a coward. I still want to keep these eyes and this mouth. My mouth is waiting to taste what a hundred yuan of rice per picul tastes like? My eyes are kept to see what kind of drama is being performed on the world stage? Just like what Dongfang Shuo said at Hongni Pass: "Who knows which family is stronger?"

Many friends, after seeing my "Miscellaneous Memories of Mei," hope that I can write about Mr. Mei's private life. Indeed, people who are with Mr. Mei every day feel that everything about him is very ordinary. However, in the minds of many outsiders, they wonder how mysterious his life is! It is rumored that he eats forty or fifty yuan worth of pearl powder every day. Some even say that he has a dozen bodyguards at home. Such claims are too bizarre! So I take this opportunity to write this article, "The Private Life of Mei Lanfang," to correct the rumors in society, which I think is what the readers of this publication need. However, I must first state that although I am his student and private secretary, I have my own position, and I will never dare to flatter my employer. This article adheres to the principle of recording everything I have heard, in order to be truthful.

### The Only Surviving Talent of Old Female Roles Li Duokui's Impression By Bingjiu

Li Duokui's coming to the south this time is a great opportunity for those who love to listen to old female role operas. In the old female role opera world, since Kui Yunfu passed away, the only successors have been Layman Woyun and Li Duokui. Layman Woyun is weak and has been retired for a long time, so today, when talking about the authentic old female role, it is really only Duokui. This time, the addition of Duokui to the Xin Xin Ping troupe has strengthened the lineup significantly. The writer has a special love for this art, and since the opening of Xin Xin Ping, I have watched his "Diao Jin Gui," "You Liu Dian," "Mulan Saves Her Mother," and other plays no less than four or five times. His voice and rhyme are still good, and his spirit remains the same. Every time his singing comes out, the mundane dust disappears. The accompanists' skillful backing further enhances the performance like green leaves.

Duokui initially learned from Binsheng and was unknown. Fu Caoxian has been playing the huqin for many years and knows what people admire, so he taught everything he knew to Li. Later, when Li performed, Fu played the huqin for him, making them a perfect combination of the flower and the green leaf. Duokui, being a direct disciple of Yunfu, has deeply understood the essence of the Kui school. His singing is gentle and roundabout, his dialogue is proper and quiet, and his tone is clear and bright. He has captured Yunfu's lingering and feminine strengths, but his voice is slightly inferior to the past. When raising his voice, he tries hard to make it sound good, but it seems to lose its smoothness. When singing low, there is plenty of gentleness and roundaboutness, but not enough vigor and simplicity. Although both have the beauty of twists and turns, they lack the taste of highs and lows and lingering sounds. This is because his study of Kui has not reached the end. Fortunately, he does not slack off in every performance, and he uses all his strength in every word and sentence, thoroughly and happily, without being afraid of being too intense. I especially love the sob and sorrow in his counter-melodies, which makes people yearn for it. His spoken dialogue is always light and crisp, losing its heavy and turbid quality. Sometimes it is overdone, neglecting the accuracy of the sounds. He is too restrained in his articulation, making it unpleasant to listen to, and he mistakenly uses the tip of his tongue. This cannot be avoided in every play, which is a common problem with Kui Yunfu. His appearance is dignified and has a noble air, which is most suitable for the identity of a titled woman. His manner and movements lack graceful charm, only focusing on being unrestrained and generous, which is also not suitable. His stage steps and sleeve movements are just like Ma Fulu's cross-dressing, which is too careless. The old female role's hand gestures, eye movements, posture, and steps should all match the four words "old and majestic," which is not just about the appearance and dialogue. In the past, when Kui Yunfu performed "Visiting the Cold Prison," when entering and leaving the prison door, his sleeves danced gracefully, and his style was enough to overwhelm the young female role. At that time, ordinary people criticized him for losing the identity of Lady Wang, so they ridiculed him as a "flower old female role." In fact, the old female role should have some of the young female role's style, graceful posture, and masculine beauty. This is the true evaluation of the old female role's posture, but it is important to avoid going too far, and the performer should understand this himself.

New Movie Introduction: The Wild Girl By Qihua

"The Girl From Mexico"

The script of "The Wild Girl" can be said to be completely written for Lupita Tovar, who has not been on the screen for a long time. However, Lupita Tovar's Mexican girl is only outwardly wild and naughty, and she cannot grasp the character of a tropical girl who likes to play pranks more deeply. Therefore, in several scenes, her overly exaggerated behavior is close to being comical.

Donald Woods plays the comfortable Matt very well, and his movements and expressions are suitable for this type of clueless character.

The director's skills are not very good. He simply introduces a story in a straightforward way. At the very least, the process of Lupita Tovar secretly loving Donald Woods is not obvious enough, so that the climax of Donald Woods being sleepless all night and rushing to Romeo's villa lacks power.

Behind the Curtain of Peach Blossoms By Qihua

"Man About Town"

Someone once said that American movies are mostly "fancy cakes." Then, "Behind the Curtain of Peach Blossoms" is naturally a delicate "fancy cake." Let's take a look at its story first: Lady Arlington and Lady Bob both feel that their husbands are too busy managing their finances and neglect their duties to their wives, so they devise a plan to pretend to be intimate with Bob, an opera manager, in order to arouse their husbands' jealousy. This script unfolds a farcical comedy on the theme of Hollywood's "new art of husband management."

The entire film is built on "coincidences." For example, when Bob and others are talking about Lady Arlington in the train, Lord Arlington is sitting opposite them: Arlington and Lady Bob see Bob and the other's wife being intimate in the window and secretly laugh at each other, etc. In terms of both emotion and reason, even the romance between Bob and Diana (Dolores del Rio) is inexplicably forced together.

The interspersed song and dance scenes at the end are quite grand, especially the beauty of the photography, such as the "close-ups" of each black gauze face and the "stamp method" of the black skirt dance, are very novel and beautiful.

OuYang YuQian Heads to Guilin to Preside Over the Drama Academy

According to the members of the "China Art" troupe who came to Shanghai, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, the supporter of the troupe, has left Hong Kong for Guilin to take the position of president of the Guilin Provincial Drama and Music Academy at the invitation of the local authorities. Ouyang's trip to Guilin is due to two reasons. Firstly, "China Art" has been dissolved in effect, and some of the troupe members have left Hong Kong, most of whom have come to Shanghai. Secondly, Ouyang is enthusiastic about drama and does not want it to end with the dissolution of "China Art." He has long planned to return to the mainland to continue his work. He immediately set off upon receiving the invitation from the Guilin authorities. He has now arrived in Guilin, and it is expected that the Guilin drama scene will have a new look in a few days.

### Unofficial Chronicles of the Pear Garden: Xu Muyun's Record of the Righteousness of the Three Lius

Liu Gansan's name is well-known to those familiar with opera. His performance of riding a real donkey onto the stage in "Visiting Relatives" is enough to show his unconventional behavior. In the lyrics of the play, he often composed new lyrics to satirize current politics, which made the general princes and ministers fearful of him. Because the politics of the late Qing Dynasty were extremely corrupt, Liu was motivated by righteous indignation and ignored the consequences, cursing the powerful. Therefore, he was deeply hated by them, and he was imprisoned countless times. In his later years, he was elected as the head of the Jingzhong Temple, so he did not often appear on stage. During the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, when Gansan was over eighty years old, someone saw him reappear on the stage. He used the position of the character he played to satirize Li Hongzhang's shameful defeat and cession of land in a joking manner. His fearless spirit, as if there was no one else around, moved the audience at the time. Unexpectedly, the sons and nephews of HeFei happened to be in the audience. They were so angry that they arrested him and imprisoned him. It is said that Gansan eventually died in prison. He was so old that he neither clung to life and feared death nor was attached to his position as the head of the temple. Instead, he appeared in person to oppose the powerful. People say that Gansan was truly a righteous and eccentric man of ancient times, hidden among the actors. Liu Xikui was extremely beautiful, but she was as beautiful as peach blossoms and as cold as ice and frost. In the early years of the Republic of China, she came to the capital from Tianjin. Famous scholars such as Yi Binfu and military men such as the Deputy Chief of Staff Lu Jin all flocked to her and strongly supported her. At that time, Cui Chengchi, an subordinate of Lu, was especially fond of Liu. As a result, Cui and Liu became husband and wife. When Lu Jin heard about this, he was very jealous and immediately dismissed Cui from his position as the head of the Second Department. However, Cui did not care about being dismissed because he had won the beauty. (118)
