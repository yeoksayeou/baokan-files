Editorial

### Mourning General Wu Peifu

Reading the books of sages and mastering the art of war; born in turbulent times, he also once commanded the wind and clouds, trapped in heavy encirclement, he could also maintain his integrity; with the posture of a lonely subject and a defeated general, at the end of his road and his resources exhausted, he was neither tempted by wealth nor subdued by force; with demons encroaching and seeking, he alone upheld righteousness, and with villains pressing upon him, he maintained his loyalty; this is rarely seen in historical records and is unmatched in the contemporary era. He can be an example for all generations and shine brightly for thousands of years. General Wu Ziyu is indeed dead but eternally alive.

The past achievements, words, and deeds of General Wu will surely be passed down. When Pingjin fell two years ago, General Wu was in Beiping, closing his doors to visitors. The Japanese attempted to use him, but General Wu refused. At that time, the Japanese were arrogant and extravagant, believing that conquering China was as easy as turning their hand. Unable to obtain General Wu, they obtained as many generals who surrendered as possible and left it at that. Later, the Japanese realized that military aggression alone was not enough to achieve complete success and sought out hawks and hounds in every possible way to act as their claws and teeth, willing to get those who were known for their prestige to act as puppets, to make appeals in their place. They knew General Wu's history but did not know China's history; they knew General Wu's prestige, but they did not know that General Wu was nurtured by China's five-thousand-year culture, and that he was a typical figure of Chinese cultural tradition, and therefore they deemed General Wu a suitable choice; the flattery and heavy bribes were ineffective, they threatened him, and when threats were ineffective, they treated him with respect and presented obsequious words; they promised him the training of troops and gave him exclusive power. They appealed to him to "save the people, save the country, save our East Asia." (Words seen in a telegram sent to General Wu by a certain Japanese person in the name of the chairman of a certain association). This spring was the period when the Japanese strategists and Chinese traitors surrounded General Wu most forcefully, but General Wu always laughed and refused; he once frankly replied to a certain Japanese lobbyist, "First, withdraw the troops and give the Chinese affairs to Chiang Kai-shek. This person is not bad, this person can do it." The lobbyist could only agree, unable to refute him. It is not that General Wu, with his so-called life as a person not in office, at the age when he was like a candle in the wind, embraced decadence, and enjoyed living outside the situation; nor was it that he was ignorant of national affairs, competing to seek his own good; in May of this year, in a telegram replying to a certain Japanese person's call for peace, he had several words: "What the whole country cannot tolerate is only sovereignty; if its rivers and mountains remain the same, and political power is not lost, then mending fences and abandoning grievances may also be done with a turn of the hand," "Based on this principle, exert more effort in mediating, if you can truly proceed gradually and satisfy the people's hearts, I am willing to brace myself and respond to it;" this is precisely the intent to ensure the integrity of sovereignty, territory, and administration, and General Wu was determined to brace himself for this.

General Wu passed away two days ago, that is, on December 4, 1939, due to septicemia caused by dental disease in Beiping, which has shocked both China and abroad. We truly do not know how the National Government will commend him, or how the Chinese people will commemorate him; what is known is that General Wu's immortal contributions to the Chinese nation after the outbreak of the War of Resistance will surely be respectfully accepted by the Chinese government and the people and will surely be commended and commemorated. Those who are obsequious and servile may use saving the people, saving the country, and saving East Asia as a pretext to conceal their ugliness, disregarding the necessary conditions of keeping the rivers and mountains the same and not losing political power; General Wu, on the other hand, was able to shout loudly while trapped in Beiping, so that those Chinese people in the occupied areas whose ears and eyes were sealed off and whose consciousness was anesthetized, knew where to turn. Some use the adverse environment and the combination of coercion and enticement as a pretext, and then submit and follow them, seeking understanding on this basis; General Wu set an example of not yielding or humiliating, refuting the idea that coercion and enticement are enough to move people, and explaining that loss of integrity is self-inflicted. Some use the old grudges between the Kuomintang and the National Government as a pretext, General Wu was indeed defeated by the National Revolutionary Army, which damaged his reputation; but when the nation was in great trouble, he would rather remain in quiet solitude and donate old grudges to support national policy. These several points are all extremely valuable lessons. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, General Wu has not charged into battle or planned strategies; however, General Wu, with the spirit of a lone army fighting hard, firmly fortified and cleared the fields, and stood alone in the face of the Japanese political offensive; General Wu, with the attitude of being a pillar in the midstream, stirred up the turbid and purified the clean, repelling the cross-currents in response to the moral wavering within the country. Alas, General Wu, inheriting the predecessors and encouraging future generations, is a special product of Eastern culture and a complete person in Chinese history!

### Soviet Union Will Not Negotiate with Finland; Also Refuses to Attend League of Nations Meeting; Claims All Issues Have Been Fully Resolved; No Basis for League of Nations Meeting

Moscow – Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, when receiving Swedish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Winder yesterday, received a proposal from the Finnish government to reopen negotiations, stating that the Finnish government is now willing to reopen negotiations with the Soviet Union in order to resolve the issue. This Swedish mediation proposal was rejected by Molotov. Molotov declared to Winder that the Soviet Union currently does not recognize the "Finnish government," and that the government has left the capital and fled to an unknown location. Therefore, it is out of the question for the Soviet Union to hold negotiations with this "government." Molotov also stated that the Soviet government now only recognizes the Finnish Democratic Republic People's Government and has already concluded a treaty of mutual assistance and friendship with it. This treaty has already formed the foundation for the equal and beneficial development of diplomatic relations between the two countries. (Fifth, TASS)

Moscow – The Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday received a telegram from League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, stating: "I have recently received a letter dated December 3 from the Finnish Permanent Representative to the League of Nations, stating that Finland and the Soviet Union have maintained friendly relations since the signing of the Treaty of Tartu in 1920 and have concluded a non-aggression treaty, which should expire in 1945. Unexpectedly, on the morning of November 30th of this year, the Soviet Union not only attacked the Finnish border but also attacked undefended cities from the air, killing peaceful people. Finland has never offended its powerful neighbor and has done its best to coexist peacefully with the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union, citing Finland's refusal to recognize the so-called border incidents and its refusal to agree to strengthen the security of Leningrad, first canceled the aforementioned non-aggression treaty, and then refused the Finnish government's invitation to mediate by neutral countries. I am now ordered by my government to inform you of the above and to request that you convene a meeting of the Administrative Council and the Assembly in accordance with Articles 11 and 15 of the Covenant in order to take all necessary steps to stop the invasion. I will continue to write to you in detail about the reasons and circumstances for my government's application for League of Nations intervention in the conflict between the two member states. I look forward to your cooperation, sincerely, Holsti. In accordance with this, I now, in accordance with the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 11 of the Covenant, schedule a meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council at noon on Saturday, December 9, in Geneva. I also propose to the President of the Assembly to convene the Assembly on Monday, December 11. I will notify you again when the above dates have been confirmed. Signed, League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol."

Molotov immediately telegraphed back to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, stating: "I am ordered by the Soviet government to inform you that my government believes that the League of Nations' proposal to convene a meeting of the Administrative Council on December 9 and the Assembly on December 11, initiated by Rudolf Holsti in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 11 of the Covenant, is completely without reason. The Soviet Union and Finland are not in a state of war, nor do they threaten the Finnish people with war. Therefore, citing Article 11 of the Covenant has no basis. The Soviet Union and the Finnish Democratic Republic now maintain peaceful diplomatic relations and signed a treaty of mutual assistance and friendship with its government on December 2. This treaty has fully resolved all issues that were previously discussed ineffectively between the Soviet government and representatives of the old Finnish government, which has now resigned. The government of the Finnish Democratic Republic also declared in a statement on December 1 of this year that it requested the Soviet government to provide military assistance to quickly and jointly eliminate the extremely dangerous source of war created within that group by the former rulers of Finland. Therefore, Rudolf Holsti's application to the League of Nations cannot be used as a reason to convene a meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council and Assembly, as the people represented by Holsti when applying are no longer the government with full power to represent the Finnish people. If the League of Nations Administrative Council and Assembly still convene to discuss Holsti's application, regardless of the aforementioned reasons, then the Soviet government believes that it cannot attend and participate. Moreover, when notifying the convening of the Administrative Council and Assembly, the League of Nations Secretary-General copied the entire original letter from Holsti, which contained slanderous and defamatory statements, showing a lack of due respect and courtesy to the Soviet Union. Therefore, the above decision is even more justified. Signed, Molotov." (Fifth, TASS)

### Several South American Countries Demand Soviet Union Withdraw from League of Nations; Uruguay Insists on its Withdrawal; Decision on Which Country Will Take Over as Chairman Pending

Capital of Argentina – Foreign Minister Cantilo recently telegraphed League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, stating that the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland clearly violates the League of Nations Covenant and should be declared and ordered to withdraw from the League of Nations. According to the fourth paragraph of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, if any member state violates the Covenant, it can be declared and ordered to withdraw from the League by a unanimous vote of the representatives of the other member states present at the Administrative Council. (Fourth, TASS)

Capital of Uruguay – The Uruguayan government recently submitted a note to the League of Nations, requesting to notify the Soviet Union to order it to withdraw from the League, and stated that otherwise, Uruguay would announce its withdrawal from the League. (Fourth, Havas)

Capital of Chile – Bolivian Minister Xue Laici, Peruvian Minister Kang Sui Ke, and Paraguayan Minister Babosa visited Foreign Minister Daunosuo on this day, informing him that each country intends to protest the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland. (Note: Both Bolivia and Peru are members of the League of Nations Administrative Council.) Foreign Minister Daunosuo then immediately visited President Saierda. (Fourth, Havas)

Geneva – The chairmanship of this session of the League of Nations Administrative Council was originally scheduled for the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has decided not to attend. According to the alphabetical order of the first letters of the names of the member states of the Administrative Council, the turn is pushed down and falls to Yugoslavia. That country has also declined, so the turn should fall to Belgium. However, people in the League of Nations believe that if Belgium strictly adheres to the principle of neutrality, it may not be willing to take over as chairman at this time. If so, the chairmanship would fall to Bolivia. That country has always had a good feeling towards the League of Nations, and its leading representative is knowledgeable and experienced in international politics and has friendships with French celebrities. It is expected that it will gladly accept the chairmanship of the Administrative Council. (Fifth, Hai Tong)

### Nordic Countries Discuss Policy, Hoping to Restore Peace

The nation has now been forced into the whirlpool of war. The governments of the Nordic countries are watching this matter with great anxiety. For the sake of that country and for our own sakes, we all hope that peace can be restored quickly. This meeting is solely to seek ways for peaceful negotiations, hoping to eliminate the scourge of war. As I see it, Finland's application to the League of Nations also aims at this." (Havas, 5th)

### Confused Reports on the Soviet-Finnish War

Moscow. The General Staff of the Leningrad Military District released a war report stating that on December 4th, due to bad weather, the air force was inactive. Soviet ground forces continued to make progress in all directions. In the far north, in the Murmansk area, Soviet forces continued to pursue the defeated Finnish forces near Petsamo, advancing to a point 25 kilometers south of Petsamo. Simultaneously, the Soviet Navy is carrying out a large-scale clearing of Finnish-laid mines outside the port of Petsamo. In the Uhtua, Repola, and Porosozero areas, the Red Army has advanced 45 to 50 kilometers from the border. Another column advancing from Petrozavodsk has occupied the town of Säkkijärvi on Lake Ladoga and the Laimola railway station north of the town and is continuing to advance. In the Karelian Isthmus, the Soviet Union has also advanced 45 to 50 kilometers from the border. (TASS, 5th)

London. According to sources close to the Finnish people in London, the Soviet-Finnish war has now stalled. Heavy snow in various parts of Finland is one of the reasons for the stagnation of the war. (Reuters, 5th)

Moscow. According to recent Soviet dispatches from the front lines, Finnish resistance is fierce. It is said that the Finnish army, aided by natural terrain, has clearly halted the Soviet advance in several locations, especially north of Lake Ladoga, along the Karelian border. The famous Karelian swamps in the area have not yet frozen, and Soviet forces are experiencing great transportation difficulties due to the lack of roads in the area. (Reuters, 5th)

Helsinki, Finland. Yesterday, more than 200 Soviet soldiers landed behind Finnish troops by parachute and have been surrounded. The Finnish government is still in the capital. Women are enthusiastically participating in various national defense efforts. Finland has implemented a compulsory service system, requiring women aged 20 to 60 to participate. (Havas, 4th)

### Germany Building Naval Port in Baltic

### U.S. Government Does Not Intend to Recall Ambassador to the Soviet Union; Believes It More Beneficial to Have an "Listening Post"; Public Opinion Unanimously Advocates Active Support for Finland

Washington. It was learned today from sources close to the White House that the United States does not intend to recall its ambassador to the Soviet Union, as the U.S. government wishes to maintain the U.S. Embassy in Moscow as a valuable "listening post." The withdrawal of the ambassador would hinder the United States' potential contribution to a sound peace in the future. (Reuters, 5th)

Washington. The possibility of recalling U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt or completely severing relations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union is considered remote here last night. Authoritative sources indicated that the government feels that any action would be detrimental to the United States and would not contribute to building world peace. Semi-official sources claim that if the Soviet military action is successful, the United States will refuse to recognize the conquest of Finland. This action is consistent with the U.S. policy of refusing to recognize other countries' conquests of "Manchukuo," Abyssinia, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Poland, and Albania. Informed sources indicate that the government is quite dissatisfied with the results of recalling the U.S. Ambassador to Germany. The only clear result of this retaliatory action was the deterioration of relations between the U.S. and Germany. It is said that the administration must consider long-range diplomatic policies. Recalling the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union would not only fail to help Finland but would also deprive the United States of its diplomatic representation in Moscow. Political circles believe that if there is a U.S. diplomatic representative stationed in Moscow when peace is restored in the Baltic region, it will be very beneficial. Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that one or two American countries have proposed that the 21 American republics issue a joint statement condemning the Soviet invasion of Finland. Hull stated that it is not currently possible to say for sure how this proposal can be realized. (United Press, 5th)

Washington. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated in a statement to the press that the Treasury Department is considering allowing Finland to defer payment of its debt to the United States, including the principal and interest on war debts due on the 15th of this month. Of all European countries, Finland is the only one that has been paying its war debt principal and interest on time in recent years. (Havas, 4th)

New York. Regarding the Soviet invasion of Finland, American public opinion is now brewing a movement to actively support Finland in order to counter the Soviet Union. This can be seen in the editorials of various morning newspapers. The New York Times published an editorial, which stated, "Finland is fighting heroically against the Soviet aggressors, and the world's conscience has been awakened by this. The concern of the American people about this matter is also growing day by day. A month ago, there were many Americans who said that the European war did not involve moral issues. These people are now silent. In short, the invasions of Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Finland are clear evidence that European freedom is threatened, and Americans should no longer have any doubts." The "New York Herald Tribune" published an article by the well-known journalist Walter Lippmann, which stated, "Emotional actions, such as severing diplomatic relations, or uttering angry words, are not enough to help Finland. For the sake of the United States, it is appropriate to show Germany and the Soviet Union that we will never abandon Finland, and to subtly inquire about Italy's views, so that it can take joint action with the United States to support the neutral countries of Northern Europe and prevent the invasion of Bolshevism."

### Roman Students Demonstrate Against the Soviet Union

Rome. More than a thousand fascist students marched through the main streets of Rome yesterday, heading towards the Soviet Embassy, shouting "Down with the Soviet Union" and "Down with Communism." Hundreds of policemen and five hundred fully armed soldiers wearing helmets and carrying rifles with bayonets were deployed around the embassy to disperse the demonstrators. The students then arranged to return here after "lunch." Dozens of plainclothes policemen lingered near the embassy throughout the day. Prior to this, the fascist students made a friendly gesture to the Finnish legation. The Finnish envoy to Italy, Yrjö Kaarlo Suonio-Carni, appeared on the legation's balcony three times to thank the students for their kindness. The students shouted "Finnish victory!" and "Long live Finland!" The Finnish envoy then made a short speech of thanks. After the fascist students cheered, they headed towards the Soviet Embassy. At the same time, Guido Gayda, the mouthpiece of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, defended Finland, saying that Finland has the right to ask the League of Nations to impose sanctions on the Soviet Union. What actions the major powers in the League of Nations will take on this matter will be of great interest. Gayda solemnly stated that Finland did not provoke the Soviet Union. The Fascist Grand Council will convene on the 14th to approve important government resolutions and listen to a speech by Mussolini. (United Press, 5th)

### Britain Considers How to Deal with the Soviet-Finnish Conflict; Germany Takes a Cautious Attitude Towards the Finnish "People's Government"

London. According to Reuters, reports in some newspapers that Britain and France are considering sending notes to the Soviet Union may not be very reliable. Although the Soviet-Finnish conflict is being considered in London, it seems premature to say that the British government has decided to take any action. (Reuters, 5th)

London. Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons today that the British government has not yet lodged a protest against the Soviet invasion of Finland. Finland's appeal to the League of Nations to convene a meeting of the Council and the Assembly was initiated by the Finnish government itself. The League of Nations Council is scheduled to meet on Saturday, and the League of Nations Assembly will also meet on Monday next week. Britain will send Under-Secretary of State Butler as its representative to express the views of the British government. (Reuters, 5th)

Berlin. German newspapers are taking a reserved attitude towards the Soviet-Finnish war and news of the "Finnish People's Government." According to responsible sources here, the German government has not yet received official notification of the establishment of the "People's Government." Foreign newspapers report that Germany will represent Soviet interests in Finland. Authorities in Berlin have denied this. It is speculated that the rumor originated from Germany's expression of readiness to use German ships to evacuate Soviet diplomatic representatives and residents of the Baltic states from Finland.

### Under the Dual Pressure of Military and Economic Power, Japan's Attitude Toward the United States Softens; Nomura and Grew Met Again, Declaring a Willingness to Respect American Interests in China

Washington. According to Tokyo sources, Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura has submitted a memorandum on the entire Far East issue to U.S. Ambassador Grew. Secretary of State Hull declined to comment on this statement when he met with reporters today. (Havas, 4th)

Tokyo. The "Asahi Shimbun" commented on Nomura's statement yesterday, saying that Nomura stated that incidents of anti-Americanism in the areas occupied by the Japanese army would be investigated and compensation would be given if necessary. After listening to the U.S. government's views on U.S.-Japan relations in China, Nomura clarified Japan's position and said that although Japan is now preparing to adjust issues between the two countries, the United States has increased its naval power in the Pacific and launched a movement in newspapers advocating a ban on American exports to Japan, which is regrettable. The American side believes that Japan's military and political activities in China aim to eliminate American interests in China, but this is a complete misunderstanding. The Japanese government protects the interests of the United States and other countries with the utmost sincerity, and Japan especially welcomes American cultural activities in China. Therefore, misunderstandings should be dispelled. The United States cites more than 600 pending cases between the U.S. and Japan, but the Japanese side estimates that about 300 cases have been resolved. All such incidents will be fully investigated, and Japan will provide compensation where necessary. Efforts will be made to prevent the recurrence of such incidents within the scope permissible by military operations. If one wants to resolve the cases based on the principle of open door and equal opportunity or based on existing treaties, it will only delay the necessary solution. Therefore, a realistic approach should be adopted to solve these cases, and in the future, the solution should be carried out locally. The Japanese News Agency stated that Nomura told Grew that the Japanese government could not conduct negotiations to adjust U.S.-Japan relations under pressure or threats, such as the U.S. and other countries' advocacy of concentrating their fleets in the Pacific and imposing economic pressure on Japan. (Reuters, 5th)

Tokyo. Foreign Minister Nomura invited U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew to his residence on the afternoon of the 4th for a second meeting. Although the contents did not touch on trade issues between the two countries, the two sides focused on discussing the adjustment of diplomatic issues. Foreign Minister Nomura expressed his view that the United States believes that the purpose of the Japanese military's activities and political affairs in China is to expel European and American interests in China, which is not correct and is a major misunderstanding. The Japanese government has repeatedly stated that it has always respected the legitimate interests of other countries. During the Sino-Japanese Incident, bombing, insults, interference, etc., which caused damage to the interests of Americans, were unavoidable accidental events that occurred during war. In addition, the inconvenience in commerce and trade in North China and other places is also an unavoidable phenomenon during large-scale military operations. There are currently more than 600 pending cases between the U.S. and Japan that need to be resolved, but the United States should first recognize the fact that large-scale warfare is taking place in China, which is necessary. Moreover, when resolving the cases, negotiations should be conducted step by step by Japanese and American officials who are familiar with the local situation in China, and the central authorities should also handle these matters with sincerity. In my opinion, the U.S. and Japan should gradually enter into negotiations on issues related to treaty rights and the principles of American foreign policy through negotiations to adjust the harm of the two countries. However, the United States sometimes advocates concentrating naval forces in the Pacific or implementing economic pressure on Japan. The Japanese government is unwilling to conduct negotiations to investigate national relations under such pressure and threats. We hope that we will rebuild the traditional spirit of U.S.-Japan friendship and conduct negotiations. Ambassador Grew responded that relations between the U.S. and Japan should not be hindered by temporary difficult problems, nor should they be used by third countries. The two countries should resolve this gap between them, no matter how difficult the problem is, between the U.S., Japan, and China. In my opinion, the American people have obtained solid evidence that can prove that Japan intends to build a particularly superior position in most of mainland China and implement a closed economic policy. Therefore, it is up to Japan to provide concrete evidence to dispel this sense of apprehension among the American people. This is the key to adjusting the current U.S.-Japan relations. If the American people learn that their concerns about the principled issue of China are unwarranted, they will be able to resolve difficult local problems and adjust the overall national literature of the U.S. and Japan. (Domei, 5th)

### Pacific International Association Discusses the Far Eastern Situation; If the United States Imposes Economic Sanctions on Japan, It Could Expedite the End of the War

Washington. According to today's news, according to a majority of representatives attending the Pacific International Association, if the United States declares economic sanctions against Japan, Japan will be forced to negotiate peace with China. This is known from a report in the conference memorandum. According to the memorandum, one American representative said that if the U.S. Navy is transferred to Singapore, its effect would be the same as if the United States imposed economic sanctions on Japan. However, the memorandum also believes that although the United States has repeatedly issued warnings to Japan, it is not only not in the best interests of the United States to be unfair to China, but it is also not an obligation of the United States. According to the memorandum, which was written by Dr. Jessup, Chairman of the Pacific Council on Foreign Relations, if the United States is unwilling to take active action on the Far Eastern issue, then European powers will not pay the price for their appeasement policy in the Far East. As for Northeast China, the Chinese delegation stated that the conference resolution still takes the recommendations of the Lytton Commission as the basis for negotiations, and the Chinese delegation insisted that the settlement of the Sino-Japanese War must be within the scope of the Nine-Power Treaty. Some representatives to the conference believe that although there is a general solution in the Far East, unless a peace agreement that both China and Japan find satisfactory is established, any solution will be difficult to last. The memorandum also pays attention to the needs of third countries in the Far East, believing that the main conditions for peace in the Pacific are established, then the development of either Japan or China is not a concern. If Japan can take satisfactory peaceful measures towards China, then Japan's future development will be either to develop Siberia to the west towards the Soviet Union, or to develop to the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, or other colonies of Britain and France. Conversely, if China negotiates peace with Japan, then China has the possibility of developing to the west and south. However, China's territory is vast, and internal development is enough for its long-term efforts, so there is no need to develop outwards. (United Press, 5th)

### Japanese Military Raw Materials Rely on the United States; Commercial Treaty Expires Soon; Negotiations Have Not Yet Begun

Havas News Agency, New York Air Mail. Businessmen here have stated that since the outbreak of the European war, the amount of goods Japan has purchased from the United States has increased by about one-third, especially steel, coal, oil, and machinery. It is generally believed that these increased purchases were originally purchased from the European market, but due to the war, they were changed to orders from the United States. In the future, if the European war is prolonged, Japan's purchases of American goods will inevitably continue to increase. However, the size of its purchasing power depends on the amount of U.S. dollars Japan has in the United States, and how the relations between the two countries will evolve after the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty expires on January 25th next year. Although the expiration of this treaty is less than two months away, negotiations between the two sides have not officially begun. Recently, the Japanese government de-pegged the Japanese yen from the British pound and established a link with the U.S. dollar. Bankers here believe that this move is aimed at increasing the amount of purchases in the United States. This can be seen from this move, because at the beginning of this European war, the British pound fell sharply, and the Japanese yen originally calculated at one shilling and two pence per yen also fell with it. After changing to using the U.S. dollar as the calculation standard, it is natural to stabilize the Japanese yen's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar and thereby facilitate the purchase of American goods. However, on the other hand, after the Japanese yen is linked to the U.S. dollar, if the British pound falls further, the Japanese yen's exchange rate against the pound will inevitably increase, which will cause major difficulties for the sales of Japanese goods to the Commonwealth of Australia, India, and the Dutch East Indies. If the Japanese government had not taken this into account, it would have changed the Japanese yen to link with the U.S. dollar long ago. The reason why the country resolutely implemented this change this time is because the European war broke out, and it had to do so. In the future, to remedy this, it can only intensify the promotion of exports to the United States, and it can obtain sufficient U.S. dollars in the United States to meet the needs of purchasing more goods in the United States. However, Japanese goods that are usually transported to Germany can still find a market here. For example, in the case of soybeans, Japan relies on them to exchange goods with Germany, but the United States produces abundant soybeans and has no need to import soybeans. So, what will Japan use to increase its export trade to the United States? This is a question. In addition, with the expiration of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty imminent, when American manufacturers trade with Japan, whether selling American goods or ordering Japanese goods, they must state in the contract that if additional burdens arise due to the expiration of the commercial treaty in the future, the Japanese side will be responsible. This shows that even if Japan wants to earnestly develop trade with the United States, it is actually plagued by many difficulties.

### China's War of Resistance is Optimistic; The United States and the Soviet Union Continue to Aid China – Hu Shih Gives a Speech in the United States

New York. According to Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, in a speech he gave at City Hall here today, although the Soviet Union has expressed its willingness to establish better relations with Japan, the Soviet Union has not only not abandoned its aid to China, but also has no intention of abandoning such aid. Moreover, this expression of the Soviet Union is the result of Japan's repeated attempts to court the Soviet Union. But in fact, the Soviet Union's aid to China is still continuing. This aid from the Soviet Union not only does not make territorial demands on China, but also does not make ideological demands. In addition to this, although Britain, France, and other countries are under pressure from Japan, they are continuing to help China, which is due to the deep sympathy of Britain and France for China. Although Britain and France are busy with matters in Europe, we firmly believe that they will never abandon China. Hu Shih then expressed his gratitude for the $25 million loan extended to China by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, saying that after China obtained this loan, it was able to obtain $50 million in loans from other countries. Moreover, this loan from the United States gave China great spiritual encouragement, because China deeply knows that it is not alone and that there are many people who support it, so even in the most pessimistic situation, it cannot help but express its optimism and hope. And this summer, the United States announced the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, which provided even greater spiritual assistance to China, because this action by the United States was taken at a time when Britain was about to succumb to Japan. Speaking of the impact of the European war on China, Hu Shih believes that the initial panic has now disappeared, because the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact has isolated Japan. To this day, Japan can only use its alliance with the Soviet Union as a tool to threaten democratic countries. As for the current number of Japanese casualties in China, according to Hu Shih, there are at least 800 to 1,000 per day. (United Press, 5th)

### Allied Powers Implement Economic Blockade Against Germany; Estimated Loss of German Export Trade Will Reach $200 Million Annually

Paris. The Allied Powers' naval blockade against Germany began last night. Several types of export goods with special permits have already left Germany today. It is estimated that after this ban on German exports is implemented, Germany's losses will reach at least $250,000,000 annually. (United Press, 5th)

### Japan Makes Representations to Britain

London. Japanese Ambassador to Britain Shigemitsu Mamoru met twice yesterday with British Foreign Secretary Halifax and Under-Secretary Butler, during which he submitted a memorandum stating Japan's objections to Britain's control of German exports, and requested that Britain respond as soon as possible, as many Japanese ships are now concentrated in Dutch ports, waiting for the shipment of German goods to Japan. (United Press, 5th)

### Britain and France Continue to Discuss Economic Cooperation; Simon Broadcasts in Paris, Confident That Victory is Assured

Paris. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon arrived in Paris last night to continue the discussions on economic cooperation that he began with French Finance Minister Reynaud in London last month. Simon gave a broadcast last night, speaking of the Allied Powers' war plan, saying that we are all determined not to let all kinds of sacrifices be thrown away in vain, and to eliminate the scourge of Europe once and for all. I, as the most elite soldier, have now followed the troops of the Maginot Line in the Allied countries. However, these hundreds of thousands of British soldiers are only the vanguard of the British army. The performance of the British and French air forces on the entire front has shown that the Allied countries' personnel and aircraft are superior to those of the enemy. Our cooperation will surely win the war and create breathable air for all other countries that only desire peace and freedom. (Reuters, 5th)

### Western Front German Army Adopts Bizarre Strategy, Local Attacks All Fail, Air Force Conducts Long-Range Reconnaissance

Paris – According to sources here, the German army has adopted a bizarre strategy on the Western Front, repeatedly launching attacks on the same location, with the aim perhaps of training troops or punishing them for failures in the first attack. For example, a certain sector of a fortress in Sivry-sur-Meuse has been attacked four times in the past twenty-four hours. Picket teams in the area also frequently venture out at night to fight, but all attacks have been repelled. (Reuters, 5th)

Paris – The American Bulletin published in Paris reports that, in retaliation for the British Air Force’s attack on Heligoland, Germany has sent aircraft to Belgium and northern and northeastern France for long-range reconnaissance. Reports from our reconnaissance aircraft indicate that German aircraft are planning to reconnoiter the terrain between the Maginot Line and Dunkirk. It is said that the French have strengthened their defenses in that area to prevent possible actions by the enemy feigning an invasion of France through Belgium. (Reuters, 5th)

Paris – The French High Command announced last night that in the air battles on the Western Front on January 6, 22, and 23, fourteen German aircraft were shot down. French aircraft are clearly superior to German aircraft. (Associated Press, 5th)

### British King Inspects Front Lines in France

London – A Reuters special correspondent reports from an undisclosed location in France that the British King, accompanied by his brother and General Gort, commander of the British forces in France, inspected the British Expeditionary Force this morning. The King and his party traveled in cars painted with various colored stripes to make them difficult to detect from the air. The roofs of the cars were covered with camouflage nets and scattered with withered leaf-colored fabric. The King first visited a Royal Air Force airfield, then proceeded to an area near the front lines to inspect the situation of soldiers guarding the trenches. The King will inspect trenches, tank traps, and concrete bunkers. (Reuters, 5th)

### German Ambassador to Italy Returns Home, German Labor Leader to Visit Rome

Rome – The German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, departed yesterday for Berlin for a few days’ stay. He will attend the first meeting of the newly established German-Italian Cultural Association and celebrate the ninetieth birthday of his father, General Mackensen, tomorrow. (Haitong, 5th)

Berlin – The official radio station announced that Robert Ley, leader of the Nazi Labor Front, has departed for Rome at the invitation of the Italian government. (Reuters, 5th)

### Philippine Islands Hurricane Causes Major Damage to Agricultural Products, Tens of Thousands Homeless

Manila – The rapidly moving hurricane that threatened Manila in the past twenty-four hours moved eastward without hitting Manila. Transportation has now been restored. It is reported that the material losses of agricultural products and other goods in the southeastern and eastern provinces exceed 3.25 million Philippine pesos. Only three deaths from the storm are currently known, but tens of thousands are homeless. Heavy rain in the past two days has caused 15,000 Philippine pesos in damage to streets in Manila. Damage to roads in the outer provinces is unknown. (Reuters, 5th)

### Another British 10,000-Ton Mail Ship Sunk by Mine, Several Other Cargo Ships Lost, German Coastal Defense Boat Also Sinks

London – The British mail ship “Doric Star” (10,866 tons) has sunk in the South Atlantic. It is rumored to have been sunk by the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee. (Havas, 4th)

London – According to an official announcement, the British ship “Sapele” collided with the Norfolk collier and sank. One Indian sailor is missing, but the remaining twenty-three crew members have safely landed. (Reuters, 5th)

London – The British oil tanker “Hurstwood” (1,670 tons), which was sailing unladen to a port in the northeast, struck a mine and sank yesterday in the eastern sea. Three crew members died. The remaining thirteen were rescued by domestic military vessels after floating in the water for an hour and landed at a certain port late last night. Several of the injured have been sent to hospitals for treatment. (Havas) A Danish-German patrol boat struck a water mine south of Langeland Island yesterday and sank within four minutes. Danish torpedo boats and three German ships immediately rushed to the rescue, but due to the strong winds and darkness, the rescue was extremely difficult. As of 7 PM last night, only two people had been rescued. According to Danish sources, there were fifty crew members on board. (Haitong, 5th)

### Soviet-Turkish Relations Increasingly Strained, Troops on Both Sides Mobilizing, Are Allies About to Become Enemies?

Berlin – The Völkischer Beobachter published an article this morning discussing the possibility of Turkey being drawn into the war. It claims that France is mobilizing troops in Syria, Britain is conducting military activities in Egypt, and Turkey is increasing its forces on the Caucasus front. The Soviet Union's response to the British, French, and Turkish military actions is to strengthen its forces in Transcaucasia and Central Asia. The Soviet Union was the first to recognize the Turkish Republic government and has been a friendly ally with Turkey through treaties. Will Turkey resolutely break with the Soviet Union and turn from ally to enemy? According to recent reports from the Near East, relations between Turkey and the Soviet Union are becoming increasingly strained. The report argues that if war breaks out, it would be very unfavorable to Turkey. First, in terms of population, there is a huge disparity. The Soviet Union has a population of 170 million, while Turkey has only 16 million. Second, the Soviet people have excellent military training, modern mechanized equipment, and a strong industrial base. Turkey has made progress in road construction over the past decade, but the country's territory is vast, exceeding pre-World War I Germany by one and a half times. Even with 30,000 kilometers of highways, it is still not sufficient for all applications. The report also discusses the possibility of British and French aid to Turkey. It claims that British and French forces certainly have the ability to control the Black Sea and prevent Soviet troops from landing on the Turkish coast, but because Soviet troops can freely use the roads of Georgia and can use land railways and Caspian Sea ships, the British and French threats in the Black Sea cannot prevent Soviet troops from attacking Turkey. (Haitong, 5th)

### Berlin Denies Conflicts Between Political and Military Leaders

Berlin – Regarding the rumors abroad of disagreements between German military generals and government leaders, authoritative sources here today solemnly deny them, claiming that Britain and France are spreading alarming rumors. The most prominent include the Munich bombing, with claims that nine generals and 150 officers were arrested, and even that Crown Prince Wilhelm was among those arrested. This can be disproven as Crown Prince William himself confirmed to foreign reporters that he is serving in the military. Another rumor is about the political ambitions of German military personnel and the Nazi Party's desire to seize military power, with Goebbels and the leaders of various provincial party branches being awarded the rank of general. When Tot, leader of the Brownshirts, was appointed Major General of the Army for his meritorious service in constructing the Western Front defenses, Britain claimed that this was a way to remove him. Therefore, the British propaganda is inconsistent and self-contradictory. In short, Britain has been engaging in such fabricated propaganda since 1933, such as claiming that Germany is not unified and is spiritually scattered, which in reality sowed the seeds for this war. The result of this propaganda was to make Poland believe that it could fight Germany and to make Britain believe that engaging in armed conflict with Germany would not cause much damage to itself, thus creating a mentality of initiating conflict. From this perspective, British and French propaganda has made a big mistake, and the two countries are now suffering the consequences. (Haitong, 5th)

### Sweden Deeply Sympathetic to Finland

London – The Swedish capital is making emergency preparations for the evacuation of residents. This does not mean that the authorities expect an emergency situation to occur soon. As for Swedes who wish to fight for Finland, the Swedish government can allow them to freely join the Finnish army, as Swedish law does not prohibit citizens from serving foreign governments. However, Finnish recruiting officers cannot operate within Swedish territory. (Reuters, 4th)

Stockholm – Some estimate that 70% of the Swedish population supports actively aiding Finland. (Reuters, 5th)

Helsinki – The number of Swedish volunteers joining the Finnish army has reached 1,600. (Havas, 5th)

Paris – Observers here recently discussed that since the outbreak of hostilities between the Soviet Union and Finland, Sweden's situation has become increasingly difficult. When the Council of the League of Nations meets in Geneva, the country, in its capacity as a member of the council, will send representatives to participate. Its attitude will be representative of the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula. The situation in Northern Europe may have unexpected developments as a result, and this should be taken seriously. According to recent news from Stockholm, Swedish public opinion has been very firm since the Soviet Union began its invasion of Finland. In Stockholm alone, more than 600 people have volunteered to serve in the Finnish army. Among them is an old man of 66 who fought against Russia for Finnish independence in 1918. People from other regions are also eagerly volunteering to serve in Finland. People from all walks of life have donated generously to the Red Cross, reaching over 400,000 kronor in just a few hours. Due to the intense emotions, the Ministry of Justice banned the publication of communist newspapers on the second of this month. In addition, Sweden and the other Nordic countries are all countries of civilization, and the influence of the academic community is sufficient to sway public opinion. University students have always been dedicated to scholarship and never involved in politics, but now they are also expressing their warm sympathy to Finland and demanding that the government actively provide assistance. The talk of cabinet reshuffle is a direct result of this kind of movement. Prime Minister Hansson began informal consultations with the leaders of various political parties yesterday. (Havas, 5th)

Stockholm – Preparations are being urgently made here to provide food and lodging for women and children refugees from Finnish towns, who have suffered from the Soviet invasion. Thousands are camping in the border forests, suffering from hunger and cold. Some have already begun raising funds to provide weapons for those who volunteer to go to Finland to fight, and to assist the Finns in other ways. Donations are pouring in. More than 500 Swedes have announced their willingness to fight for Finland. (Reuters, 5th)

### General Wu Peifu Dies, He Yingqin Expresses Deep Condolences, His Lofty Integrity is Worthy of Emulation, Japanese Military Police Deploys Security Lines at Wu's Residence

Chongqing – According to foreign dispatches from Peiping, General Wu Peifu died in Peiping on the 4th due to blood poisoning. The telegraphic news is brief, and the truth is difficult to fully understand. After receiving news of Wu's death, Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin telegraphed his condolences to his family on the 5th. According to He, Wu was stubborn by nature and always held an uncompromising attitude. When I was in Peiping presiding over military affairs, Wu was not tempted by profit or coerced by threats and has remained the same for many years. This old man's integrity is lofty, and he has become stronger with age and can truly be a model for our country's military personnel. It is unfortunate that he has passed away, a loss for our country. The following is the text of He's telegram of condolence. To Mrs. Wu Ziyu of Peiping: I am shocked and grieved to hear of Mr. Ziyu's passing last night. Mr. Ziyu was trapped in enemy territory with unwavering integrity for many years and can truly be a role model for our country's military personnel. It is only because of a minor illness that he has suddenly passed away. The news is deeply saddening. I hope that you will accept the change with grace and properly arrange the funeral. I am sending this telegram to express my condolences and best regards. He Yingqin. (5th)

Hong Kong – News of Wu Peifu's sudden death in Peiping has caused shock and grief here. According to news from Peiping and Tianjin, Wu had not been reported ill a few days ago, but it is known that Wu has been under increasing pressure from the Japanese recently. Messengers from the special services agencies have been frequently visiting Wu's residence. It is said that Wu's attitude has been very firm. To anyone coming to entice him, he replied that the complete withdrawal of troops must be the precondition. Wu's death occurred around 4:45 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. Japanese doctors were seen entering and leaving Wu's residence frequently on the day before Wu's death. After Wu's death, Japanese military police were stationed around Wu's residence, and anyone entering or leaving had to undergo a rigorous inspection. (5th)

Peiping – It is now learned that General Wu Peifu died in Peiping yesterday afternoon between 4:00 and 5:00 PM after blood poisoning from a tooth extraction. A German doctor happened to be by his side. After the news of his death spread, Japanese military police immediately deployed security around Wu's residence.

When a Japanese spokesperson recently hosted reporters, reporters inquired about the fact that the Japanese side had asked Wu to take the position of army leader of the Peiping Restoration Government but was rejected by him. The Japanese spokesperson replied that this was an inaccurate rumor. However, it is learned from reliable sources that Wu had repeatedly refused to work for the puppet regime and demanded that the Japanese army withdraw from China first. Although the Japanese side repeatedly tried to entice him, Wu ultimately refused to cooperate with the new regime. (Reuters, 5th)

Peiping – A Japanese spokesperson here said today, "Wu Peifu's death is a loss for Japan. Wu has prestige among the people, especially in North China. If he could cooperate with Japan, it would be of great help to Japan." The Japanese doctor who extracted Wu's tooth and caused his death was named Ito. According to Wu's secretary, Wu did not make a will or leave any last words for China. A group of monks dressed in yellow robes are gathered at Wu's residence to arrange funeral matters. (Associated Press, 5th)

Peiping – Dr. Steckerford, the head of surgery at the German Hospital here, said that if General Wu Peifu had accepted his advice and undergone surgery at the German Hospital, his life could have been saved. According to Dr. Steckerford, Wu consulted him six days after the onset of the illness. By Sunday, Wu's decayed tooth was swollen and his cheeks and throat were threatening his breathing. At that time, he urged Wu to go to the German Hospital for surgery, but Wu and his family opposed this, as the German Hospital was located in the embassy district. They insisted on performing the surgery at his residence. Although Dr. Steckerford believed that surgery on the diseased tooth was not a major procedure, he did not perform the surgery at his residence because it was inconvenient. Later, a Japanese doctor named Terada came to see him and believed there was no problem. Unexpectedly, he died during the procedure. According to Dr. Steckerford, before he saw Wu, Chinese doctors had treated him with herbal medicine for six days, which delayed the surgery. (Associated Press, 5th)

### Sino-Soviet Air Route Officially Opens Yesterday, Giant "Chongqing" Aircraft Flies to Hami, He Yaozu Travels to Soviet Union

Chongqing – The Chongqing-Hami air route, sponsored by the Ministry of Transportation, officially opened today. The giant "Chongqing" aircraft took off in the misty fog at 8:00 AM, carrying nine passengers and several hundred kilograms of luggage and mail. More than a hundred people saw them off at the airport. The aircraft is expected to arrive in Hami on the 6th and return to Chongqing around the 8th. (5th)

Chongqing – He Yaozu, director of the Military Affairs Commission's Office, originally planned to fly to the Soviet Union on the first flight of the Sino-Soviet Aviation Company scheduled for September 25 to inspect the route, but the trip was delayed because the company's facilities along the route were not completed. The Sino-Soviet Aviation Company has now completed preparations and began operations this morning. Director He departed on the aircraft this morning. Among those who saw him off at the airport were Chief of Staff He Yingqin, Chief of Staff Zhang Zhizhong, Foreign Minister Wang’s representative Duan Maolan, Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zhu Shiming, Second Secretary of the Soviet Embassy Banisnikov, and dozens of other officials of the Military Affairs Commission. It is rumored that when He arrives in Moscow, he plans to visit the Soviet government authorities. (5th)

Lanzhou – The Sino-Soviet air route officially opened on the 5th. The "Chongqing" aircraft left Chongqing for Lanzhou on the 5th and is scheduled to fly to Hami on the morning of the 6th. (5th)

Chongqing – Direct passenger and postal air service between Chongqing and Moscow began today. The Ministry of Transportation's "Chongqing" aircraft is scheduled to fly to Hami today, and the Sino-Soviet Aviation Company's aircraft will take over from Hami to Almaty. Then passengers and mail will be transferred to a Soviet aircraft to Moscow. The entire journey will take only four days. Soviet aircraft will connect with Chongqing aircraft in Hami four times a month and fly to Moscow. The Chongqing-Hami line and the Almaty-Moscow line have been operating independently for some time, but direct service began today.

### Shanghai West Residents Cannot Bear Harassment, Maintenance Committee Actually Collects Donations with Armed Force, Door-to-Door Extortion by Armed Bodyguards, Shanghai Municipal Council Revenue Not Affected

The Continental Times reports that, yesterday (the 4th), it was learned from reliable sources that the "Shanghai Municipal Government," under the protection of the Japanese, is now collecting donations from residents in the extra-settlement road areas of the Public Concession at "any cost," causing increasing anxiety in the area. So far, only Chinese residents have been affected by the "strict" regulations of the puppet regime, but it is reported that foreigners in the area are also worried about this situation.

Puppet Regime Collects Donations with All Kinds of Intimidation

When the tax collectors of the puppet "Municipal Government" go to Chinese homes to collect donations, they are always accompanied by armed bodyguards. Their strict methods include threats and intimidation. According to some Chinese residents in the area who told reporters, the puppet officials sometimes use "persuasion" and threaten residents with "trouble," saying, "Paying the money will avoid trouble."

Residents of the Western District Rise Up in Protest

A spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council told reporters yesterday that the Council's tax collection office has received a large number of complaints from taxpayers protesting the puppet regime's attempt to collect donations. However, it has not been confirmed that the puppet officials have used force to threaten these taxpayers.

Council Revenue Not Encountering Difficulties

The spokesman continued, residents reported to the Municipal Council that they have already paid taxes to the puppet regime. However, the Municipal Council has not encountered difficulties in collecting taxes in the area so far. The Municipal Council collects taxes based on the contractual relationship between residents and the Council, which stipulates that residents are entitled to certain municipal facilities and services provided by the Public Concession.

Municipal Council's View on Maintenance

To maintain public roads, supply water and electricity, and provide police services, residents in the area who do not want these rights do not have to pay taxes to the Municipal Council. Taxpayers who do not pay taxes have no right to use the roads in the area, as these roads are owned, built, and maintained by the Municipal Council.

Japanese Newspaper Speaks Out

The Japanese army newspaper "New Shanghai Daily" carried a report yesterday reflecting that the puppet "Municipal Government" is still encountering difficulties in its attempt to collect donations despite using intimidation. According to the report, the Municipal Council's donation rate is 14% for households and 16% for shops. This rate is too high, so the puppet regime has reduced the rate to 9% for households and 11% for shops.

### Finnish Residents in Shanghai to Celebrate Independence Day Today – Finnish Consul to Give Encouragement to Residents

On July 17, 1919, the Finnish government established a republic and signed a treaty with the Soviet Union on October 14, 1920, becoming a newly emerging nation in Northern Europe after the European war.

All the American residents in Shanghai

held a banquet at the Community Church on Xiaqiao Road from 6:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. yesterday to bid farewell to Commander Feagan and his wife.

The ship was then towed away by a Japanese military police speedboat. It is noted that the license of the ship from the Public Works Department is No. 3301.

### Incident of False Police Shooting British Soldiers – British Army Attaches Great Importance – Investigation of the Truth of the Incident Completed – Will Submit Representations to Responsible Parties

According to the North China Daily News, it was confirmed yesterday (the 4th) that the British military and consular authorities attach great importance to the incident on Sunday night in which one British soldier and one civilian were arrested in the western district by the "municipal police" and detained in No. 13 Jessfield Road for about three hours. At the time of the incident, unarmed British soldiers were shot at more than fifteen times by "municipal" police in front of a café, and bullets pierced the doors, but none of the British soldiers were hit, which is quite surprising. The British authorities, after completing the investigation of this matter, may make diplomatic representations and protest to the responsible officials here.

British Soldiers and False Police Clash Violently

It was also learned yesterday that about an hour before the shooting, there was a quarrel between a British soldier from the former company of the East Surrey Regiment and a "municipal" policeman in front of the Meiliyuan on Great Western Road. At about 9:00 p.m., one of the British soldiers of the regiment and the "municipal" policeman exchanged blows, and the "municipal" policeman's forehead was cut and injured.

Detained British Have No Connection

It is now confirmed that the British soldier who fought was not the British soldier named Beer who was forcibly arrested more than an hour later, and the young British resident who was "arrested" with Beer had absolutely no connection with the original assault incident.

False Police Break into Houses with Weapons

At that time, one "municipal" policeman retreated after being injured. After a while, about sixteen "municipal" policemen, each carrying a rifle, led by a Chinese police officer carrying a Mauser pistol, went to Jack's Restaurant next to Meiliyuan and threatened the Danish owner of the restaurant, Mr. So-and-so, with a Mauser pistol.

Arbitrary Arrests Lead to Negotiations and Release

They searched various rooms in the shop and on the second floor and arbitrarily arrested British soldier Beer and another British man and took them to No. 13 Jessfield Road, where they were detained. It was not until 1:00 a.m. yesterday morning that they were released after negotiations between Major Hunter, the British military liaison officer, and Assistant Chief Inspector York of the police department.

East Surrey Regiment Conducts Strict Alert

During the negotiations, sixteen British soldiers of the East Surrey Regiment, wearing steel helmets and carrying bayonets on their rifles, under the command of a lieutenant, were stationed outside No. 13 Jessfield Road. Opposite the door was a military truck with a Bren machine gun mounted on it, with the muzzle pointed directly at the gate of No. 13, and a strong British soldier directed traffic on Jessfield Road, maintaining strict vigilance for a long time. The "municipal" police once retreated. Lieutenant Colonel Swinton, commander of the East Surrey Regiment's battalion, inspected the sniping site on Great Western Road and forbade his subordinates from entering the two cafes where the incidents occurred.

### Public Works Department Quarantine Hospital Occupied by Japanese

The Public Works Department properties within the Shanghai International Settlement north of the Suzhou Creek, including the Western Boys' School on North Sichuan Road, the Chinese Boys' School on Haskell Road, and the public wharf in Yangshupu, have been sold to the Japanese. It has now been learned that a portion of the buildings at the original site of the Public Works Department Quarantine Hospital at No. 41靶子 Road was previously occupied by the Shanghai Japanese Residents' Association Clinic. Yesterday, it was further learned that the Huazhong Headquarters of the Japanese Medical Association will soon move into No. 41靶子 Road. It is noted that the Medical Association is a Japanese medical organization whose work is to establish hospitals and eliminate infectious diseases in China, with the intention of showing favor to the Chinese people. From now on, the entire original site of the Quarantine Hospital will be occupied by the Japanese.

### Six Arrested on Dunxin Road Still Held at British Army Headquarters – Will Wait for Responsible Parties to Claim Them

On the morning of the day before yesterday, four armed individuals led two of their companions into the British defense zone in front of the Shanghai Milk Company, a Danish business located at No. 145 Dunxin Road, attempting to arrest Mo Miaozhai, a Chinese broker of the company. They were arrested by patrolling soldiers of the British Seaforth Highlanders. Yesterday, a reporter from the Dazhong News Agency continued to inquire with the Central Army authorities and learned that all six individuals had been detained and were still being held in the British Army barracks as of yesterday. It was previously reported that the six individuals were false police officers, but it is now unknown which unit they belong to, but it is rumored that they are members of the false "Weixin Government Plainclothes Team." Yesterday, the British Defense Force Headquarters in Shanghai issued a statement saying, "The British Army authorities are currently detaining six Chinese, four of whom are armed. All six are wearing Chinese clothing and were detained on Dunxin Road at 11:00 a.m. on December 4 because these people entered the British defense zone in an attempt to arrest a Chinese man. The British Army authorities are still detaining these people and will release them only after a responsible party requests recognition and is verified."

### Applications for Second Batch of Fractional Currency Exceed Total Amount – Continuing to Print Third Batch – Notice from the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank – Starting on the 8th, All Industries Will Be Allotted Based on Discretion

After the Ministry ordered the issuance of one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank entrusted Yongning Company in Hong Kong to print them. The first batch of 500,000 yuan (300,000 yuan in one-cent notes and 200,000 yuan in five-cent notes) has already been fully issued. The second batch of 500,000 yuan (200,000 yuan in one-cent notes and 300,000 yuan in five-cent notes) has already been printed and will be issued by the Shanghai Branch starting on the 8th of this month. The notice from the bank is recorded below: "The fractional currency notes additionally printed by this bank will be issued starting on December 8. All industries in need may apply directly to this bank and will be allotted based on discretion." However, in order to prevent factory speculation and the influx into the occupied areas, the issuance method is stipulated as follows: All major companies and businesses may apply to the bank with a letter. Members of the Silver Wire Industry Association can receive them directly from the bank. Other industries can receive them from their corresponding banks and money shops.

Total Amount Applied for by Various Industries

Various companies, businesses, and members of the Silver and Money Industry Association have all applied to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank with letters to receive fractional currency notes. The bank has reviewed them separately and decided to issue them selectively starting on the 8th. It is heard that in recent days, the amount of fractional currency notes applied for by major companies and businesses has exceeded 500,000 yuan, so the amount allocated at the time of issuance must be selectively reduced. As for the Tobacco Exchange Guild, Secretary Shen Peifan was specially sent to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank at 3:00 p.m. yesterday with a letter to discuss the issue of members' tobacco exchange shops receiving them with Director Chen. It is heard that the bank has accepted the principle of receiving them, but absolutely prohibits tobacco exchange shops from hoarding for profit. If the bank finds out that this is the case, it will be punished.

Negotiating Third Batch

Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency learned from the Central Bank that the bank had been approved by the head office to print a third batch in order to meet social needs, in addition to gradually issuing the second batch of fractional currency notes that have already been printed. The contract has been negotiated with the British merchant Yongning Company in Hong Kong to continue printing in order to remedy the lack of fractional currency notes. It is planned to print all five-cent notes to make them consistent with the second batch of fractional currency notes. However, it has not yet been fully decided whether the total amount will be 500,000 yuan. As for the second and third batches of fractional currency notes, the design is exactly the same as the first batch. It is heard that the temporary value vouchers previously issued by various industries (companies, stores, and banks) have been ordered to be recalled by a certain date and must not be issued again in the future. Regarding the token vouchers of the power company, it is heard that it has been decided to gradually recall them from the date of issuance of the second batch of fractional currency notes.

### Captain of Qingpu County Militia Assassinated

Fan Yunxi, captain of the militia brigade of the eighth district of Qingpu County, was suddenly shot and killed by an enemy on the morning of the day before yesterday near the Dujia Hangzhen on the south side of the Qinghu Road. Fan was unable to avoid the shots and died on the spot after being shot several times. Fan was forty years old and was from Yincun Temple, west of the Hongqiao Road Airport in Shanghai. After the previous captain, Yang Mao, was shot and killed by Japanese soldiers, Fan succeeded him as the brigade captain, but only for three or four months. It is a pity that he was killed now. The family has prepared a coffin for burial and has reported to the superiors, requesting that the murderer be apprehended and brought to justice.

### Shanghai Factory's Domestically Grown Tobacco Cigarettes Approved for Internal Transport – Accumulated Cigarettes at Coastal Defense Approved for Release with Certificates

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting approval for the internal transport of cigarettes produced by Chinese cigarette factories. The Ministry of Finance replied: "Respectfully received your telegram. It is understood that the goods made from raw materials purchased in the war zone and prohibited from import were previously stipulated by the Ministry to be prohibited from sale in the rear in order to strictly enforce the ban. All cigarettes produced by Shanghai factories that are indeed made from domestic tobacco leaves should be issued a certificate by the cigarette factory association, and the brand names should be reported to the Ministry for verification and approval for transfer to maintain Shanghai. As for the cigarettes transferred in and accumulated at the coastal defense before the implementation of the ban, in order to take into account the difficulties of merchants, the starting point should be provided and the documents should be clearly stated, and the brand names and quantities should be reported to the Ministry in separate items for verification and release by the relevant authorities. Please follow the instructions of the Ministry of Finance."

### Train Derails Due to Engine Explosion – Beijing-Shanghai Train Overturns – Japanese Spokesman Admits in News Report – Initial Information Indicated More Than 40 Japanese Soldiers Died – Puppet Army Battalion Disarmed on Qinghu Road

According to the French-language Shanghai Daily News on the 5th, a Japanese authorities spokesman stated at the Japanese press conference yesterday that the railway between Shanghai and Nanjing had another derailment incident due to someone secretly placing explosives on the tracks. According to the Japanese, the locomotive was derailed due to the explosion, causing the train to derail as well. The spokesman also said that there were no injuries in the derailment, but that some people were slightly injured because the train was moving very slowly.

Japanese Army Swept Away on Qinghu Highway

In order to strengthen the guerrilla work in the Songhu area, the military authorities of the ×th war zone specially dispatched elite troops to advance into the suburbs of Shanghai one after another. According to reliable news from merchants on the Qinghu Highway, the Songhu Guerrilla Third Detachment of Gu Fusheng has been ordered to open up the Qinghu Highway. There have been battles along the highway in recent days, and the lower-level soldiers of the traitorous troops, unwilling to work for the enemy, have rebelled and surrendered with their weapons to Gu's troops, which has strengthened their momentum. The Japanese attempt to control the Chinese by using the Chinese will ultimately fail. After the troops launched a major sweep of the Japanese army the other day,

Entire Puppet Army in Songze Resolved

The puppet army's first battalion on the Qinghu Highway was entrenched in Songze Village, colluding with the Japanese army to extort and plunder, committing all kinds of evil. Detachment Commander Gu Fusheng mobilized his troops to launch a surprise encirclement when the puppet army was unprepared the other day. The puppet army could not resist and was completely resolved and disarmed, and the puppet battalion commander was also captured alive. The troops are now advancing along the Qinghu Highway to the Qibao Hongqiao area.

### Xiangtai Workers' Demands Accepted by Employer – Old-Age Pension Not Yet Decided – Can Be Resolved Through Further Negotiation

On the 30th of last month, the Xiangtai Sawmill, a British business in Yangshupu Bridge, Hudong, elected representatives to make five demands for improved treatment to the employer. In addition to insisting on the proposed conditions, the workers also increased the demand for rice subsidies and re-elected representatives to negotiate with the employer yesterday.

Acceptance of Conditions

After receiving the conditions proposed by the workers, the employer immediately replied to the workers' representatives as follows: (1) Increase wages, starting from January next year; (2) Increase rice subsidies, adding 4 yuan per month if the price of each shi of rice is above 13 yuan, and adding another 3 yuan if it is above 24 yuan, and adding 3 yuan per month for every 10 yuan that the price of each shi of rice rises; (3) If the factory orders the workers to work three days a week, it will pay four and a half days' wages, and if it works four days, it will pay five days' wages; (4) Issue old-age pensions, with workers working eight or less years receiving an old-age pension of 5% of their wages, and workers working more than eight years receiving 4%, with the old-age pension being paid every five years; (5) If workers contract diseases due to work, the employer will bear all medical expenses for those who need to be hospitalized as certified by a doctor, and wages will be paid as usual for those who are recuperating at home; (6) Wages will be paid as usual for holidays and commemorative days.

Work as Usual

After receiving the employer's reply, the workers' representatives slightly inquired about the workers' opinions the day before yesterday (the 4th). Most of the workers expressed satisfaction with the employer's reply, but there was a slight dispute regarding the old-age pension, which should not be difficult to resolve through further negotiation. All workers are currently entering the factory to work as usual.

### Appeal to All Sectors on Thrifty Campaign – Waive Festival Gifts – Donate to Refugees

The Shanghai Thrifty Campaign Committee yesterday issued a letter to the citizens of all sectors, saying, "Since the Japanese launched the war of aggression against China, iron hooves have been everywhere, and homes have been reduced to ruins. The people of various places have suffered miserably from the ravages of war. The disaster is unprecedented in history. At this time of serious national crisis and national emergency, all compatriots should work hard to save the country together. The members of our committee believe that we are limited to the environment of this isolated island. In order to express our patriotic devotion, we have no choice but to abide by the government's clear order to promote thrift and carry it out consistently. Conserving unnecessary consumption, storing the country's material resources, and directly developing a habit of frugality are all ways to increase the strength of the war of resistance. All these movements are the minimum creed of the people of the isolated island. Now, the Western Christmas and our

Winter Solstice are approaching, and it is customary in Shanghai to give expensive gifts to relatives and friends, and the annual consumption is staggering. Moreover, most of the gifts are foreign goods, and the economic outflow is especially distressing. In the current climate of thrift, it is necessary to eliminate this custom. There are still 100,000 refugees stranded in Shanghai. They have no clothes or food and are exposed to the wind and cold. Hundreds have died of freezing on the streets, and their corpses are lying on the roadside. Those who see them are heartbroken. What will the future hold? After we have enough to eat and wear, shouldn't we be moved by

compassion and save the money for gifts to help the suffering refugees? Even if there is a special situation that requires us to send festival gifts, we hope that we can purchase domestic goods as much as possible, or reduce the amount of gifts, and use the surplus funds to provide relief. This is a righteous act. We hope that leaders from all walks of life and social leaders will take the lead and set an example, so that not only will tens of thousands of refugees be blessed, but the country and society will also benefit."

### Forced Cash Purchase of Slaughtering Tickets – Dispute Between Meat Industry and Slaughterhouse – Meat Industry Association Submits to Political Department for Investigation

Regarding the dispute between the meat industry and slaughterhouses in the French Concession, the situation has become increasingly serious. The Meat Industry Association held a meeting last night to discuss response methods. In addition to requesting the police and political department to deal with the slaughterhouses, it was also decided to have each member meat shop to put up a resolute resistance. A Dazhong News Agency reporter learned the following details:

Forced Slaughtering for Profit

The Meat Industry Association of the French Concession received a joint letter from four slaughterhouses, including Heji, stating that Lu Wenqing, manager of the slaughterhouse, and Chen Jinhai, etc., are coercively forcing our slaughterhouses to purchase slaughtering tickets at No. 8 Tongkang Lane. If tickets are not purchased in advance, the meat shops will not be allowed to pick up pigs for slaughter. This situation has forced our slaughterhouses to temporarily agree. Therefore, we can only request your association to find a way to provide relief and stop this. The letter also attached sixteen slaughtering tickets to the association. The slaughtering tickets are in the form of a triplicate oil-printed ticket. The bottom side is the bill of lading, which states that no money will be taken. However, after the meat shop receives this bill of lading, it must take the bill to the State Bank and pay 9 jiao to receive the first-linked slaughtering ticket, before being able to pick up pigs for slaughter. The Meat Industry Association believes that privately printing tickets to force the slaughterhouses to pay cash for tickets is an illegal act. The association has sent a photo of the original letter signed by Heji, along with the oil-printed ticket, to the political department for investigation.

Association Meeting Resolves to Resolutely Reject

According to a gentleman from the Meat Industry Association, the intention of those who privately print the ticket is purely to disrupt the market for profit. This ticket is taken from the meat shop for the pig slaughtering fee, and only 8 jiao is counted when issued back to the slaughterhouse. If a thousand pigs are slaughtered per day, it can earn a hundred yuan. If a certain slaughterhouse slaughters 30 pigs per day, the slaughterhouse can deliberately dispatch fewer pigs if it purchases tickets with cash. At the end of the day, they can extract a commission from the slaughterhouse. Therefore, once this plan is realized, the biggest losers will be the small slaughterhouses and the meat industry, who rely on it for a living. It will indirectly disrupt the market and increase the price of meat. The association has investigated and verified the truth and presented it to the political department for investigation." At 6:00 p.m. last night, the association convened a meeting of members to discuss response methods. A decision was made to oppose the cash purchase of tickets and continue to settle accounts at the end of the month as before. If forced to buy tickets, each member will refuse."

### Japanese Soldiers Parading in Yangshupu Area

According to a visitor from Hongkou, the Japanese recently conscripted over a thousand new soldiers from their country to Shanghai. Their camp is located on the empty space on the side of the Shanghai Textile Factory in Yangshupu. Around 10:00 a.m. the other day, all the Japanese troops there suddenly lined up and paraded in the Yangshupu Road area. All were unarmed. They did not return to camp until around 1:00 p.m.

### Lawless Land in Western Shanghai – Seems Like Another World – Bandits Run Wild in Broad Daylight, Committing All Kinds of Evil – Puppet Police Act as Accomplices, Chaos Reigns

In the western part of the concession, lawless people are rampant and order is exceptionally chaotic, and the Public Works Department is unable to perform its duties in several locations. Added to this, the puppet police interfere unreasonably in everything, making it more difficult and creating a so-called "lawless area." The reporter went to inspect the area yesterday afternoon and records what he saw below.

Absurd Slogans

Caojiadu (to Wujiaochang), Jessfield Road, Robison Road and Brenan Road are full of colored paper slogans on every telegraph pole. The sentences are absurd, some of the ink is not dry and has been smeared into ghost charms by those who are interested. People who see them laugh at them.

Puppet Police Abuse Power

The deployment of puppet police on Yuyuan Road is similar to the former situation. At the intersection of Yidingpan, a pedestrian was knocked down by a rickshaw puller and a dispute arose. When the patrol officer was trying to mediate, the puppet police crowded forward and obstructed in every possible way. As a result, all the unrelated parties, pedestrians and rickshaw pullers, fearing disaster, had already escaped. Passing by No. 830 Yuyuan Road (next to the Ko Tien Florist), I saw a wooden sign hanging in front of the door, on which were written the words "Juchuan Academy Branch." The iron gate was tightly closed and heavily guarded. Pedestrians who approached were immediately scolded. I am afraid it is also a new trick set up by a certain party.

Bandits Run Wild

Eight puppet police officers were stationed at the intersection of Columbia Road and Amherst Avenue, and their posture was fierce. A bandit suddenly took advantage of a resident who was nearby and snatched a wool sweater that he had been holding. When the patrolling police officer caught him and was about to take him away, the puppet police detained the officer and arbitrarily released the "bandit."

### Zhejiang Road and Beijing Road Intersection: Bandits Open Fire, Resist Arrest; Stray Bullets Injure Five People; One Dies from Serious Wounds; Bandit Gang Eventually Escapes

Yesterday at approximately 2:50 PM, at No. 119 Zhili Road, Beijing Road, two bandits armed with guns broke in to commit robbery. The people inside the establishment, in a state of panic, started shouting. The two bandits, fearing exposure, didn't bother with the robbery and hurriedly retreated. At the doorway, they fired a shot into the sky as a threat and fled west along Beijing Road.

However, the people inside the establishment remained calm and pursued them closely. Upon reaching the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Beijing Road, the person following them, seeing patrol officers nearby, quickly reported the incident. The officers, upon hearing the alarm, immediately stepped forward to stop them. Unexpectedly, the bandits, having noticed the officers, turned and opened fire. The officers then began a chase, with the bandits fighting and fleeing, causing

bullets to fly everywhere.

Passersby scattered for cover. By the time they reached Qiaqing Road, the bandits turned north and fled. At the Xiamen Road intersection, they again engaged in a fierce exchange with the officers. Over twenty shots were fired like a string of pearls. The bandits, running out of bullets, still managed to escape into the crowd. As a result, five passersby were injured by stray bullets. One of them, named Cai Hongqing, 54 years old, from Ningbo, was sitting on the No. 18 trolleybus when he was

struck by a stray bullet

in the flesh. He was immediately taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The other four injured passersby, Gu Shouchang, Mao Youcai, Xuan Rongqing, and Qin Yougen, were all sent to Renji Hospital for treatment after the incident. Gu Shouchang died shortly after arriving at the hospital because the bullet hit his chest and injured a vital organ. The other three suffered varying arm and leg injuries and are still receiving treatment.

They found only thirty cents in small coins and a ticket on his person, with nothing else to identify him or his family. The body was taken to the morgue.

Liu and the others usually travelled by rented car, appearing quite wealthy, and would often give small sums of money to local thugs. When the search was carried out, the two Chinese men had already fled. It is reported that the police will transfer the three Kim Koreans to the Japanese consulate for questioning and have issued an order to all Chinese and foreign officers to strictly apprehend the escaped Chinese men, Liu Shaoguan and Sanzi, and bring them to justice.

Later, she had an ambiguous relationship with Xu Xingsheng (22 years old, residing in Yinfu Li, Xiafei Road, running a sock factory), a tourist from Changzhou, leading to a love triangle and a wave of jealousy. Chen and Xu developed a feud. On the morning of the 4th at 11:00 AM, Chen Youshan was walking near the intersection of Kangti Road and Caishi Road in the French Concession when Xu saw him and gathered people to hold Chen down.

Chen's clothes and overcoat, along with his felt hat, were pawned at Changshengku, and the money was divided and spent. Chen reported the incident to the French police station, who arrested Xu Xingsheng and retrieved the pawn ticket. Yesterday afternoon, he was brought before the First Criminal Division of the Special Second Court. The police lawyer, Gu Shouxie, presented the case, stating that the defendant was charged with assault, intimidation, and fraud, and that the police were still investigating.

### Robbery of Cotton Boat Solved; Seven Bodies Unearthed; Three Key Criminals Arrested

Wu paid 2,000 yuan in advance and hired a civilian boat at Qiaojia Bridge to transport 200 bales of cotton, with Zhang Xianglian escorting the boat, while Wu returned to the factory first. However, when the boat reached a remote area north of Minhang, it was suddenly attacked by robbers. Zhang and the seven boatmen were shot and killed, and the entire cargo of cotton was stolen. Over a month later, the case was recently solved by a guerrilla unit in Maqiao. It was reported in the previous newspaper. It is now known that three key criminals have been arrested, and the bodies of Zhang and the others were found in Niu's Garden in Yutang, east of Maqiao.

### Family Tragedy: Mother Runs Away, Father Dies, Leaving Behind a Helpless Orphan

The Shi family, residing at No. 175 North Henan Road, consisted of the husband, Shi Anqing, a 30-year-old man from Ningbo who worked as a cloth merchant and had a heroin addiction, and his wife, Shi He, a 31-year-old woman who worked as a female worker in a tobacco company in this city. The couple originally had five children, but sold one daughter, and three others died. Only one daughter, Shi Aju, 12 years old, remained, assisting with household chores. At the beginning of last month, the couple had a major argument due to financial problems. Shi He, in a fit of anger, ran away from home. Shi Anqing, disheartened by this blow and struggling with his heroin addiction, and being of weak constitution, caught a cold at the end of last month and died from illness. After his mother left and his father died, the girl was left helpless and wandered aimlessly. Eventually, someone directed her to the Laozha Road police station and the Industrial Bureau's Child Protection Department for assistance. Those responsible, feeling pity for the girl's plight, sent her to the Children's Home of the Charity Association for care and education.

### Shooting at Zhaofeng Casino: Japanese Spokesman Denies Knowledge; Japanese Debt Not Yet Returned

The English-language "Da Mei Evening News" reported that, according to reliable sources, regarding the incident of a Japanese military officer, Susa, firing a gun at the Zhaofeng General Assembly Casino on Sunday afternoon, the "Entertainment Venue Supervision Department" (led by the Japanese Suzuki) took swift action to suppress further news from spreading and instructed the operators of various gambling dens to keep silent about the matter. It is said that the "Supervision Department" ordered the Zhaofeng General Assembly to detain anyone inquiring about the incident, if possible, and to immediately report to the Supervision Department at No. 9, Lane 470, Yuyuan Road. A spokesman for the Japanese embassy firmly denied the news of the shooting as reported in the English-language "Da Mei Evening News" and stated that the Japanese army took a serious view of the publication of this news. However, news received this morning confirmed that the three Japanese were members of the Special Affairs Department. After losing three or four thousand yuan gambling at the Zhaofeng Casino, they took the Zhaofeng Casino license from its glass frame and trampled it underfoot to vent their anger. The casino operator did not return the debt owed by the three Japanese, as setting this precedent would make it impossible for gambling dens to operate. When the Japanese fired the gun, the gamblers in the "Apple" gambling den at the Weldon Cafe in the same building, upon hearing the sound, rushed out the door and onto the street, causing great panic in the vicinity. About five hours later (9:00 PM), the Zhaofeng General Assembly returned to normal, and gamblers re-entered to gamble as if nothing had happened. The gambling den's license was re-framed in another glass frame.

Police lawyer Li Zhishan recounted the course of the investigation and stated that the key suspect surnamed Zhu was still at large and could not be arrested. He requested that the court investigate the matter. When questioned, the two defendants claimed that the fake pistol belonged to Zhu and that they were being fooled by him. They asked for leniency.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor,

I read the news article in your newspaper "West Shanghai Becomes a Hotbed of Vice, Another Terrible Murder Occurs, Head Found in Caojiadu, Body Also Found Awaiting Examination," and the article mentions my name, Xia Xijiang. I was greatly alarmed and fear that someone has mistaken my name for another person. Throughout my life, I have lived a peaceful and stable life, minding my own business and not interfering in external affairs. Not only do I not have a friend named Wang Zhidong (aka "Little Wang, Stinky Fish Head"), I do not even know him. This is well known and cannot be refuted. The truth will eventually come to light. Furthermore, the article contains defamatory words such as "usually makes a living by extortion and theft," which is self-defeating. This matter involves a murder, theft, and the reputation of an individual, and I request that you correct the facts and clarify the truth. I respectfully ask that you correct the article to clarify right and wrong. Sincerely, Xia Xijiang, applicant for correction. Witness: Wanshengtang Medicine Shop. December 5.

The second act of Western Youth Basketball features three Group A games tonight. The opening act between Yiu Luen and Maxling White was already exciting, and the second act between Shanghai Youth and Little Bears is even more intense.

Maxling White vs. Yiu Luen (Group A) 7:15 PM

Little Bears vs. Shanghai Youth (Group A) 8:15 PM

### Finance: Market Sentiment Shifts; Severe Decline in the Gold Market; Exchange Rate Market Sees Slight Rebound; Low Price Reaches $4038

Yesterday's cash gold spot market experienced a sharp decline. However, what goes up must come down, and the exchange rate market saw a slight rebound yesterday, causing anxiety in the gold market. Securities firms were the most active sellers, and the number of retail investors selling gradually increased. However, Hong Kong firms showed no signs of buying. Although the foreign exchange rate was tight, money exchange businesses and gold firms continued to buy, but ultimately their efforts were insufficient. The day's trading began with signs of weakness, and securities firms were the first to announce sales. Although the exchange rate was reported as flat, the market opened with a drop of $28 to $4160. Shortly afterward, as the foreign exchange rate softened slightly, money exchange businesses stepped in to buy, briefly stabilizing the market and rebounding by $20. However, the exchange rate suddenly returned to flat, and securities firms and retail investors resumed selling. In addition, a certain bank and spot goods firms also frequently sold, and the exchange rate hardened, so although a certain money exchange business continued to absorb the sales from time to time, it was difficult to reverse the downward trend. The market broke through the $4100 level, reaching a low of $4075. At noon, gold firms bought at bargain prices, causing a slight rebound, but the market closed at only $4085. In the afternoon, the market continued to decline, and securities firms resumed selling, reaching a low price of $4038. However, money exchange businesses, gold firms, and securities firms suddenly resumed buying, and the market closed at $4076, down $112 from the previous day. Trading remained very active, with approximately 3500-3600 taels traded. Gold ornaments in jewelry stores were down $15. Customs gold remained flat.

Spot Gold Falls Sharply by Over $100

From the beginning of the morning, sentiment seemed weak. Although many parties still wanted to push up the price, buyers were scarce. Retail investors were eager to sell. Securities firms were the first to announce sales. Although the exchange rate was reported as flat, the market opened with a drop of $28. Securities firms sold 30 taels to money exchange businesses for $4160. Shortly afterward, as the foreign exchange rate softened slightly, money exchange businesses raised prices, briefly increasing the price by $20 to $4180. However, this was temporary, and the market soon fell again to $4125 under the selling pressure from securities firms and retail investors. Later, a certain money exchange business took the opportunity to buy more at a low price, and sellers watched, with only jewelry stores selling slightly. The price rebounded by $25. Money exchange businesses bought 20 taels from securities firms for $4160. After this, a certain gold firm suddenly sold over 100 taels. At that time, the exchange rate had hardened, and a certain bank was also frequently selling on behalf of customers, causing another drop of $57. Money exchange businesses sold 10 taels to jewelry stores for $4103. Then, speculators such as a certain gold firm took profits and bought again, seeing a rebound of over $20. Gold firms did 20 taels for $4125. Around 11:00, the exchange rate continued to harden, and selling pressure resumed. A certain bank and jewelry stores sold heavily, and buyers were scarce, breaking through the $4100 level. A certain bank sold 10 taels to money exchange businesses for $4075. At noon, gold firms bought at bargain prices, and the market rebounded slightly. Gold firms bought 20 taels from securities firms for $4095. Later, money exchange businesses sold dozens of taels, dropping the price by another $10 to $4085, the closing price for the morning session. In the afternoon, the initial situation was weak. A certain money exchange business sold, and securities firms continued to sell. In addition, the exchange rate softened, and the market dropped sharply by $25. Money exchange businesses did 20 taels for $4060. Later, because selling pressure remained strong, the market dropped by $20 again. Money exchange businesses sold 10 taels to gold firms for $4040. At that time, another securities firm suddenly bought in, and money exchange businesses also bought, causing the price to rebound by $35 to $4075. After this, hearing that the exchange rate continued to harden, securities firms sold again, and gold firms also sold heavily, causing another drop of $37. Money exchange businesses did 10 taels for $4038. Later, the exchange rate suddenly softened, and market sentiment changed. Money exchange businesses, securities firms, and a certain gold firm scrambled to buy, and the price soared by $51. A certain money exchange business bought 40 taels from jewelry stores and other businesses for $4090. Finally, as the exchange rate hardened again, retail investors took profits and sold, causing a drop of $25. Jewelry stores sold 20 taels to gold firms for $4065. Later, money exchange businesses bought dozens of taels, causing a rebound of $11 to $4076, the closing price for the evening session. As a result, the market fell by $111 compared to the previous day, with a total fluctuation of $142. The selling price of spot gold from gold firms was $10 higher, and the buying price was reduced by over $20. The current price of standard gold was $50-60 lower than the listed price, with few transactions.

Gold Ornaments Down $15

The initial price of gold jewelry in jewelry stores was $425 per tael at Dahonghang. At 9:45, the price was reduced by $5. At 10:40, the price was reduced by another $5. At 2:10 PM, the price was reduced by another $5. As a result, Dahonghang changed the price to $410. The new stores had the same price as the previous price, and the buying price was reduced by $15 to $20.

### Exchange Rate Trend Shows Slight Change; Chinese and Hong Kong Firms Both Sell

Yesterday's exchange rate market saw no changes in HSBC's listed prices. The spot market for British and American exchanges saw a sudden shift in style. Although the process saw both tightening and loosening, the trend and the results of the closing prices seemed to show a slight turnaround. The buying firms of the past week had not completely disappeared, but most of them were taking profits and waiting temporarily. In addition, Hong Kong telegrams were frequently supplying the market, and selling exceeded buying, causing the market to slowly soften. The morning began with a tight state of British flat and American tight due to the overseas British and American exchange rates shrinking to within $3.9. The British exchange rate was 4 shillings and 4375 cents, and the American exchange rate was $7.1875 (equivalent to a British-American exchange rate of $3.8873). Although there were many importers buying, foreign banks and Hua Bi were supplying, and China firms were also selling. The British exchange rate tightened to 4 shillings and 42875 cents, and the American exchange rate reached $7.15625. After 9:30, Hong Kong telegrams came to supply the market, causing the situation to stabilize. Later, as Hong Kong firms continued to sell, and Chinese firms followed suit, the market hardened. Around 11:00, the British exchange rate had risen to 4 shillings and 53125 cents, and the American exchange rate had also risen to $7.375. At noon, buyers and sellers hesitated, and transactions were scarce, causing the market to close in a calm state. The prices were still 4 shillings and 53125 cents and $7.375. In the afternoon, Hong Kong telegrams were still actively selling, and Chinese firms continued to sell intermittently. Foreign banks also showed willingness to supply the market, causing the market to harden to 4 shillings and 59375 cents and $7.5. Later, cotton yarn firms made settlements, but their numbers were insufficient to affect the market. The closing prices were 4 shillings and 59175 cents and $7.46875, a softening of 15625 and a depreciation of 15 compared to the previous day. The futures market prices were slightly closer to the spot prices, but the situation was similar.

More Selling than Buying in the Exchange Rate Market

In the early morning, because the London long-term rate was close to the distant rate, 625, the New York silver price was flat, the London gold price was fixed, and the exchange rates for British to American, to Shanghai, and to French were all flat. The American exchange rate shrank by 25 to British, unchanged to French, and down 5 cents to Shanghai. The central listed prices for each exchange rate remained the same. The opening prices for spot goods at banks were 4 shillings and 4375 cents for British and $7.875 for American, flat British and tight American compared to the previous close of 03125, due to the shrinking exchange rate. After opening, although importers came to settle, foreign banks and Hua Bi showed willingness to supply the market, and Chinese banks also sold, causing the market tightening to be minimal. The British exchange rate tightened to 4 shillings and 421875 cents, and the American exchange rate reached $7.15625. HSBC's listed prices were announced and unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced and unchanged. After this, Hong Kong telegrams suddenly came to sell, and the situation stabilized. The British exchange rate returned to 4 shillings and 4375 cents, and the American exchange rate also returned to $7.1875. Foreign banks also showed willingness to sell at the above prices. Later, Hong Kong telegrams continued to sell, and Chinese firms also followed suit, causing the market to harden. Around 11:00, the British exchange rate had risen to 4 shillings and 53125 cents, and the American exchange rate had also risen to $7.375. At noon, selling had ceased, and buyers were few, causing the market to be quiet until the close of the noon session. The spot selling prices at banks were still 4 shillings and 5325 cents for British and $7.375 for American, looser British and more convenient American compared to the morning opening by 09375.

American Dollar Reached $7.50

In the later market, Hong Kong resumed selling, and Chinese banks continued to sell, and foreign banks also showed willingness to sell, causing the market to continue to harden. The British exchange rate rose again to 4 shillings and 5375 cents, and the American exchange rate rose to $7.50. Then, yarn and cotton firms took advantage of the cheap prices to buy, and Hong Kong telegrams stopped selling, causing the situation to soften. The British exchange rate reached 4 shillings and 53125 cents, and the American exchange rate reached $7.375. Buyers gradually decreased, and the position felt more relaxed, causing the situation to harden again. Until the evening close, the spot selling prices at banks were 4 shillings and 59375 cents for British and $7.46875 for American. The British exchange rate for this month was 4 shillings and 578125 cents, and the American exchange rate was $7.4375. As a result, the spot British exchange rate loosened by 15625, and the American exchange rate hardened by 25 compared to the previous day. The British exchange rate for this month was cheaper by 171875, and the American exchange rate was longer by 28125.

Hong Kong Exchange Rate Drops by $8

Hong Kong, 5th. The exchange rate market opened flat this morning. Both British and American exchange rates were unchanged. The spot Japanese exchange rate tightened slightly by 15 to $103.25. At 10:05 (), the spot exchange rate fell by $2 to $332. At 10:35, the spot exchange rate continued to fall by $3 to $329. At 11:30, the market was stable, and all exchange rates were unchanged. The market opened at 2:30 PM, and there were also no changes. Later, the spot exchange rate fell again by $3 to $326. The spot exchange rate fell by $8 for the whole day.

Tianjin American Dollar Flat, British Dollar Slightly Tight

Tianjin, 5th. The exchange rate market opened flat this morning. The spot British exchange rate tightened slightly by 0625 to 4 pence 75. All other exchange rates were flat. The spot American exchange rate remained at $6.125. The exchange rate also stood at $116. The black market for United Notes also opened at the original price of $92.

Profits from Foreign Currencies Supply the Market

Yesterday, the supply of British and American gold pounds was smooth, and the market situation was. Customers took profits on British and American gold notes, and the market price fluctuated greatly. The American gold note was strong in the early morning, and the market price was $13.85. Later, there were many suppliers, and the market price gradually declined, retreating to $13.44 at noon. Supplies continued to be abundant in the afternoon, and the evening market was $13.30. The Hong Kong note fell sharply due to the active selling of the Hong Kong exchange rate, the market price fell sharply. The demand for French franc notes and Annam notes was weak, and the market price was soft. The supply of Singapore notes and Dutch notes increased, and they all tended to be weak. The Canadian note and the Philippine note fell due to the softening of the American gold note. The supply of Japanese gold notes was also smooth, and the evening market was $1.248. The demand for Korean notes was scarce, and the evening market was $1.132. Yesterday's market saw British gold pounds fall by $2.10, British surplus notes fall by $1.50, American gold pounds fall by $2.70, American gold notes fall by $0.43, Hong Kong notes fall by $0.13, French franc notes fall by $0.002, Singapore notes and Dutch notes each fall by $0.10, Canadian notes fall by $0.10, Annam notes and Philippine notes each fall by $0.05, and other currencies were unchanged.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds果然多方占勢; Foreign Stocks Slightly Soft

In yesterday's securities black market, the buying side gained strength from short covering, gradually moving higher. The market had been hovering for too long, and some of the short positions could no longer withstand the pressure. The buying side took the opportunity to move, and both Class C and Class A shares rose above $7 again. The trend may improve slightly again, but it will be difficult to break through the dollar mark. Some say that the ongoing talks between Britain and Japan may be related, but this may be an overreaction. Others say that it is difficult to borrow stock for short selling, so there is a slight rebound, but there is no major change. Yesterday's trading was light in the morning, and the market price was firm. Buyers were few, but sellers were even fewer. In the afternoon, buyers such as Xie Da, Tiansheng, Tongkang, and Shengda all had needs. Only Dasheng, Jiufeng, and Lianyi were selling. The price rose slightly. The market price improved by 3 to 5 cents across the board. The total number of transactions was approximately 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.

Stock transactions: 20 shares of Xinxin Company were traded at a price of $6 each.

(The previous day's stock transaction of China National Goods Company shares was mistakenly reported as China Commercial Electricity Company shares. This is hereby corrected.)

Yesterday, the activity of various public utility stocks decreased slightly. Buying sentiment was still strong for famous stocks in the morning. In the afternoon, a small number of bulls took profits, and prices softened slightly, but they rebounded firmly at the close.

London, 4th. The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt remained calm today. There were no changes in the upper and lower range of each government bond.

London, 4th. The listed prices of British-owned Far East company stocks only saw a slight decline in HSBC Bank shares. Shares registered in London fell by £1.5 to £81.5. Shares registered in Hong Kong fell by £1 to £84. The rest were unchanged.

### Grains: Only More Imports of Foreign Rice Can Slightly Curb Rice Manipulation; Highest Price Reached $45 Yesterday; Foreign Rice Priced at $43 per Bag Due to Constant Arrivals

Yesterday's domestic sources and river shipments were reportedly blocked and did not arrive. Only 23-24 truckloads of Japonica rice arrived in the Sujia Road area by train. Merchants' sentiment was strong, and they held onto their goods and waited for the market to open. There were many rumors circulating in the market, causing general customers to worry and not know what to believe. Seeing that market goods were limited, and with the winter season approaching, they all started buying. Merchants saw that the opportunity had come and would not let it pass. They raised prices repeatedly, with ordinary Japonica rice being offered at $45 and Liangshan white Japonica rice reaching $43. The prices of all other goods were raised by $1-2. As arrivals were scarce, but inventories were abundant, and the next batch of huge amounts of foreign rice was in transit, rice prices had reached their peak. Those with goods were selling their inventories. Spot foreign rice was also being sold, and the market was suddenly flooded with goods. After the strict implementation of market rules, even though some people in the industry were good and bad, and some unscrupulous people violated the rules and traded privately, they did not dare to do so openly. Therefore, in the central market, there were more sellers than buyers, and the overall situation showed an oversupply. The rising wind in the market could not last long and showed a wavering situation. A market with drastic changes cannot withstand any setbacks. If it encounters even a small disturbance, market sentiment will be difficult to recover. Local stores all stopped buying, and both retail and wholesale sales were stagnant. As a result, the wind turned back, and prices went down step by step. By the close, ordinary Japonica rice was $43.5, and high-quality goods were only $44. Premium Japonica rice was $41-42, an increase of only 40-50 cents from the previous market. The total number of transactions in the city was only 7,000-8,000 bags.

Customer Xian rice rose again by nearly a dollar yesterday morning, and the market became more tense. Although speculative firms had shifted their attention to foreign rice, smaller customers and firms were still active. The price of various Xian rice from Jingwu and Jiangbei had reached $38.45, and the lowest was $37.23. However, in the afternoon market, as foreign rice orders arrived and foreign prices were fixed, the market was suppressed by profit-takers, lowering the price by about half a cent. The total market transactions were only about 2,000 bags, but the Jiangbei Xian rice had nearly 3,000 bags.

The price of foreign rice rose in the morning, with Annam Saigon and broken rice all rising by 60-70 cents to nearly a dollar. However, the first batch of over 40,000 bags had arrived at the port and were unloaded from the warehouse, and the second, third, and fourth batches were also arriving in Shanghai to be unloaded. Some had also been transferred from Hong Kong, so there were over 100,000 bags of foreign rice in the market. The price of $45, which had been shouted on orders the previous day, had fallen by $2, and the price of the original 198-pound bag was $43. Although there was no continuation, market sentiment had calmed down. Therefore, the market stood by 5-6 cents, and if there were no other influences today, it may have to.

### Flour Market Firm and Quiet; Wheat Fixed Firm, Dark Firm

Yesterday's flour market saw little change. The board price of the No. 2 flour factory remained at $8.20, but the situation remained firm and strong. It was only willing to maintain sales on the street and refused sales to customers and firms. Therefore, the return warehouse order was still 30-40 cents higher than the factory's board price. Domestic flour also stood at an average price of over $8. Total market transactions amounted to over 40,000 bags, including 3,000 bags of Red Peony and Red Car No. 4 flour, which were reportedly handled by customers at a price of $7.40. It was also reported that customers were continuing to handle a batch of Bat Brand foreign flour at a price of $9. With rice and oil prices rising again, market sentiment was still optimistic. Today, 36,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Tianjin, 1,000 bags to Tanggu, and 400 bags to Yantai.

Yesterday's wheat market showed a fixed firm and dark firm phenomenon. There were few arrivals, and prices were high. Holders were keen to hoard goods, but factories were greedy and unwilling to lower prices to absorb them. As a result, Fuxin and Fufeng factories each handled only 500-600 bags at the original price of $13. There were no official transactions in other market transactions, and the highest price was still said to be $13.50-60.

### Cotton Yarn：Yarn Market Retracts, Double Horse Approaching 700 Yuan Mark

The yarn market, which had surged the previous day, retreated again yesterday. Although actual demand was still considered strong, market sentiment appeared fatigued and slightly shaken. This was due to a slight easing of foreign exchange rates and a gradual increase in shipping costs. The stability of market conditions prompted profit-takers to emerge, and sellers flooded the market, causing prices to fall again. 20-count Double Horse yarn broke through the 700 yuan mark. However, the raw cotton situation remained firm, so some investors remained optimistic and continued to buy on dips, as factory costs have risen and profitability has been diminished.

The yarn market opened this morning with a bullish sentiment. 20-count Double Horse spot yarn was quoted at 715 yuan, similar to the previous day's closing price. However, the afternoon off-market price had already fallen by five yuan. Shortly after, it was reported that foreign exchange rates had eased and gold prices had slightly declined, prompting long positions to cash in their profits. As a result, Double Horse weakened, and the market continued to decline. The market price fell to 698 yuan, below the 700 yuan mark. According to half-day transaction statistics, 2,115 bales were traded. 20-count Double Horse fell by 15 yuan, Heavenly Maiden by 18 yuan, and Double Globe by 15 yuan. Today, 375 pieces of export yarn were shipped to Dalian and another 215 pieces to Yantai. The amounts purchased by various trading groups are listed below:

### Cotton Prices Also Ease: 30,000 Bales of American Cotton Arrive

Cotton trading was slightly less active, but continuous purchases over the past few days have been robust. At the same time, the easing of foreign exchange rates has somewhat calmed market sentiment. However, most cotton merchants remain optimistic about the future, although prices have risen for several days and may temporarily stabilize. Weavers and Chinese merchants are gradually increasing their purchases, and the New Yu factory is also procuring in large quantities. Demand from the Qingdao area remains constant. Yesterday, Tongzhou flower prices weakened by one yuan. The supply from Northern Jiangsu included 3,860 bales of Tongzhou cotton, 241 bales from Changyinsha, and 1,940 bales from Northern Sha. The current opening prices for raw cotton are listed below:

In other news, regarding foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market initially experienced a sharp rise due to buying pressure and strong overseas demand. Telegrams from Mumbai indicated a surge in prices, leading to unusually high market sentiment. Later, due to selling by spot traders and banking circles, market conditions softened slightly. As a result, closing prices were four to five points higher than the previous day for near-term contracts, and slightly lower by five to six points for distant contracts. Indian prices, including forecasts, rose by more than ten rupees, Egyptian prices rose by more than twenty points, and Liverpool prices fell by three pence.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, telegrams from the United States have indicated that due to difficulties in sourcing and shipping, raw cotton prices have been increased several times. Yesterday, a certain company telegraphed that prices had been increased by as much as 30 points. However, Japanese factories continue to purchase raw cotton unabated, with daily transactions amounting to several thousand bales. Chinese factories have been relatively quiet recently, while fellow traders remain active. The K.G. Meldahl arrived the day before yesterday carrying more than 30,000 bales of American cotton, all for the exclusive use of American companies. Customs clearance procedures are currently underway, and the cotton will be delivered to factories within a few days. The factory prices for yesterday's cotton, calculated at an exchange rate of 7.3125 yuan per US dollar, are as follows:

### "Anti-Aircraft Gun"

— Xin Liang

A poison that sucks people's marrow - we should eliminate it

This is a narrow, dark, and dirty alley, next to a garbage bin piled high with dregs, cloth scraps, and all sorts of waste. The houses seem to be quite old, with dirty black bricks replacing the formerly white-washed walls...

Right next to that garbage bin is a dilapidated cookhouse, its door tightly closed, not even letting a breeze blow in. The only opening connecting the inside and outside is a small window, but even this window is often covered, the glass painted a dark green color - so what's happening inside the house, what kind of ghostly show is being put on, outsiders naturally have no way of knowing.

Every day I walk past it, and except for sometimes seeing groups of two or three people crowded outside that small window, it's almost always "silent as the grave," so quiet it's almost frightening.

I've also noticed that the people crowded outside the window, their clothes and decorations, are all so tattered. Their hands and faces are so pale that seeing them immediately brings to mind "ghosts" and other frightening things. On their bodies, we certainly cannot see any so-called "vitality," any so-called "heat."

At certain times, they come and gather outside that small window, they all look like "hungry ghosts," their eyes fixed on the window. Their strange appearance makes it seem like they want to open that glass window so they can rush in and gorge themselves, eat to their heart's content. Finally, when a light appears in the window, and two figures move around inside the house, they all rush forward, clamoring "Buy one!", "I'll buy two!" and other such sounds. They clutch banknotes and coins in their hands, push them into the window, and then exchange them for a small, white paper packet. Carrying this paper packet, they look as if they've gotten a sumptuous meal, walking away very carefully.

Every time, I see this group of people coming and going, coming and going. Even on days with strong winds or heavy rain, they still go to that small window several times, each time exchanging a few banknotes for a packet of white paper. At first, I didn't find it very strange. Perhaps they were heading there to buy miscellaneous items, I thought, because that family had a small opium den right in front of their house.

But no, one very cold noon, when I walked past there as usual, I saw a "young man" who was as skinny as a rake, his face as pale as a "dead man," sitting next to the garbage bin and smoking... What he was smoking wasn't opium, nor was it a kind of slab tobacco. He was precisely smoking something people call "anti-aircraft gun." The young man's face was almost gray-green, and with the protruding blue veins, it was truly frightening to look at. In his thin hands, he held tin foil, a few cigarettes, and a box of matches. He put a bit of white powder on the tip of the cigarette, then lit it with a match, and with all his strength, sucked it into his mouth...

Only then did I realize: what was being sold in that small window. This thing is a poison that sucks people's marrow, sucks people's blood! Ignorant people have formed an unbreakable bond with it, and if they don't have it day and night, they will immediately stop breathing. This kind of poison, like "lotteries," is gradually spreading in Shanghai: it has already caused countless promising "people" to tread the path of death, and it has caused countless people to fall... Should we arbitrarily allow this insidious thing that kills without bloodshed to spread? Do we have a way to eliminate this terrible thing? For the sake of our own lives, for the sake of the entire society, for the sake of the future of our country, we should all unite to eliminate this poison! The writer hopes that the authorities can make every effort to actively ban it, so that this poison disappears from Shanghai once and for all!

How fervently I pray!

### Donate Winter Clothing Instead of New Year's Cards

— Ji Xiannian

Every time it comes to a festival, it seems like there has to be a bit of embellishment, like the upcoming Christmas, with Santa Claus in red clothes and a white beard, and New Year's cards to wish people a happy new year. But are these many embellishments at every festival considered a waste at the moment? ? Yes, this should be said to be a pointless consumption! A few days ago, someone suggested saving this waste (referring to New Year's cards) and donating it as winter clothing. And someone even mentioned the following words: "We should give everyone a hint while the festival is still far away, otherwise it will be too late." I agree with this statement.

New Year's cards are the most common gift around Christmas. Students in schools, employees in large companies, and people from all walks of life, before Christmas, everyone is happy to send beautiful New Year's cards to their friends or elders, which has almost become a routine. Of course, this is a good phenomenon in times of peace and prosperity, but now we can definitely say: "Save it!" This makes sense. When your friend receives your New Year's card, they will definitely be very happy, but after a long time, your New Year's card will have already become the raw material for waste paper. Of course, there are exceptions, but such cases definitely account for the majority.

So New Year's cards should be saved, and the result of saving is beneficial to the person saving. If you save the money you were planning to buy New Year's cards, even if you don't donate it as winter clothing, then at least you will reduce an expenditure. If you further use the money you save to donate as winter clothing, then in addition to you, many, many people will receive your gift. However, this method will not be approved by those who view New Year's cards as a form of socializing and entertaining (of course, their New Year's cards are exceptionally exquisite and precious). Therefore, I thought of a biased idea: "You might as well first take the money you were going to buy New Year's cards and donate it as winter clothing, and then write your friend's name on the receipt, and then write a few auspicious New Year's greetings that you think are appropriate, and then send it to them." This method, which kills two birds with one stone, although it has many inappropriate aspects, we should approve of it in principle.

Also, there are elementary school students. Around Christmas, most of the materials for art class in schools are for making New Year's cards. This makes the children have a good impression of New Year's cards, and they ask their parents for money every day to buy New Year's cards to send to their friends. Although the New Year's cards they buy are not expensive, the saying "many grains of sand make a pagoda" tells us that we should not underestimate it. How many elementary school students are there in Shanghai? I really hope elementary school teachers pay attention. In addition to elementary school students, middle school students and university students should also think about these things.

Finally, I hope everyone can naturally participate in this "movement." Even if the methods are different, it doesn't matter, as long as there is no disagreement in principle. Please don't dislike our early raising of this issue.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianyi

Shao Daohua said, "Things will revert to their opposite when they reach an extreme. You must understand this principle. National prosperity and urban prosperity are natural. But prosperity has a certain degree. Beyond this degree, there will be various problems. For example, in cities, tall buildings are being built. New York already has buildings with more than a hundred floors. In Shanghai, until now, there is still no building exceeding fifty floors. But I heard that their architects' association held a meeting, and Shanghai is not allowed to build buildings exceeding forty-eight floors, especially those kinds of apartments and hotels. Because people who build tall buildings have a competitive spirit. For example, if you build eighty floors, he will design and build ninety floors next year. And then another person will want to compete with them and build a hundred floors. But does a hundred floors count as the end? Someone will definitely break the record and build a hundred and five floors. If it keeps going on like this without limit, will it really pierce through the sky? In fact, tall buildings are indeed the product of big cities, but they are not necessarily welcomed by citizens. If there is a fire or earthquake, tall buildings always suffer. And living inside is like living in a big pigeon cage, which can make you never set foot on the ground all year round. Individuals often like to wander in areas with clear water and beautiful trees, and under the shade of trees. Or in the corners of walls and houses, a flower or a stone can also be quite interesting. People living in this kind of tall building will never enjoy this. Also, in areas where factories are densely packed, with chimneys standing tall, the smog makes people uncomfortable. Originally, after the war, Shanghai's citizens naturally decreased in number because everyone returned to their hometowns. Housing prices also became cheaper, and commodity prices did not rise. But because Shanghai became prosperous again, everything became noble again. And people's hearts are also like this: when things are still, they think of motion, and when things are moving, they think of stillness. People who have lived in the countryside for a long time feel too lonely, and they think of going to the city for a walk. People who have lived in the city for a long time always feel that the city is noisy and dusty, and the best thing is to live in the countryside, or at least have a villa in the countryside, where they can temporarily escape the noise. What do you think?" The two Miss He nodded repeatedly. They thought: That was her father's idea. Why didn't he want to live in Shanghai, but taught us to prepare to build a small villa not far from Shanghai, which meant this. Now that they had found a place in Liberty Village, did it mean that people living in Shanghai, as Shao Huihua said, all wanted to move to other places? At this moment, Wu Junsu said, "It is not easy for a big city to gather so many citizens. It is not the result of one day or one night. Conversely, it is not easy to disperse them, unless there are special circumstances." (211)

### Playwright in the "Chinese Mirror" (1) — Random Memories by the Plum Tree

— Li Feishu

The news came and agitated people's "emotions" again, adding a lot of "unwise" and unnecessary annoyance! Let's stretch our brows! Let me first provide the reader with a humorous story: "A man named Wang from Hangzhou was a magistrate in a certain county during the late Qing Dynasty. He had some ability to attack and was very strict in governing his subordinates, but he was extremely impatient by nature! When he got anxious, his speech would stammer, and his stuttering was difficult to control. At that time, the Taiping Rebellion was happening, and the city was under martial law. Those entering and exiting were questioned and searched without exception! One day, Magistrate Wang dismissed his attendants and went to the countryside alone in disguise. When he returned, the city gate was locked! The soldier in charge of the lock did not recognize Wang at first and repeatedly questioned him. Wang initially tried to answer with polite words, but when he saw that he was being difficult, he used his Hangzhou official accent and said angrily, "You... you confounded thing... don't you... even recognize... me, your master?" The soldier squinted at him, snorted through his nose! He made a contemptuous gesture and slowly asked, "Are you the master? What is the master's honorable name?" Wang was anxious to explain himself, but he hated that he had no evidence to gain trust, and he became even more anxious! His anger grew even greater! And his stuttering worsened! He answered angrily and scoldingly, "Con... confounded thing, my... my name is Wang, Wang Wang... bastard!" Because he was anxious to scold people, he didn't even have time to catch his breath! So the phrases were unclear, and he spoke them all in one breath! He scolded himself instead of others."

This is a joke making fun of impatient people, and perhaps this kind of thing happens. The reason I want to cite this story is that his own subordinates didn't recognize their superior. Furthermore, the law is so strict that it should not be different for different people. However, I am still very puzzled to this day as to why only Mei Guangsheng, no matter where he goes, whether it is a "busy metropolis" or a "remote village," people always recognize him? And everyone has an air of joy and welcome when they see him, which is really incredible! What's more, there is something else that is rare for ordinary people to encounter, that is, no matter where he goes, the customs inspection is always kind to him, and there is never any harshness or difficulties. Sometimes he is even exempted from inspection. This is not only the case in China, but also abroad! And he does not take advantage of this unexpected advantage to do anything illegal. This is completely different from the humiliating incident of the ambassador stationed in a certain country many years ago.

In my "Random Memories by the Plum Tree" series, I mentioned that when I traveled to Japan, the United States, and Russia many years ago, I was exempted from customs inspection. I also caught a French artist who was returning to China from Manchuria and encountered harsh difficulties from customs officials, but later he was able to pass safely because Mei Xiansheng's photograph was discovered. I promised the readers to present the translation of the manuscript, and now I want to fulfill my promise.

Random Writings on the Art Scene

### The Drama Art Society Rehearses "Motherland"

— Hua

The Opening Date of Lafayette May Be Around Christmas

Zhang Wenjuan Will Give a Performance at the Xuan Palace Theater

China Travel Is Said to Have Cooperated with a Certain Company

The first phase of news from the Shanghai Drama Art Society has appeared in yesterday's advertisement. At the same time, it has also been announced that they will cooperate with the Lafayette Theater from the 21st. However, according to the news I received when writing, the date of the premiere may be changed, because the first play to enter Lafayette is not the previously announced "Set an Example," or the already rehearsed "A Family of Liars," but "Motherland," originally written by Sardou and translated by Jiang Wenxin. When China Travel performed this play at the Carlton, it received enthusiastic praise from all walks of life. "The Sino-French Drama Art Society" almost became rivals in order to compete for the performance of this play. Now that "the Sino-French Society has disbanded," the "Drama Art Society" happened to take over the site of the Sino-French Society to perform this play, so naturally they want to take it very seriously. After signing a contract with the Lafayette Theater, it was decided that Wu Tianlai would direct the play, and from yesterday onwards, the daily rehearsal date has been set, hoping to premiere on the scheduled date (21st). However, this play has many actors and magnificent scenery and props, and whether it can be rehearsed maturely within half a month is uncertain, so although the premiere date has appeared in the announcements, in fact, it may be postponed to around Christmas.

What about the Xuan Palace Theater that was left behind? Many people speculated that Tang Huaiqiu's "China Travel" would continue, but this news has become a thing of the past. Tang Huaiqiu's path has been to contact Xuan Palace, Da Hua (the Da Grand Theater that will be opening soon), and Carlton. As of now, he is closer to cooperating with a certain film company, and whether it can become a reality is something I dare not speculate on. The Xuan Palace also doesn't want the venue to be empty, so of course that is certain. After various negotiations, it was decided that Zhang Wenjuan, the pocket-sized Tan Xinpei, would sing for a while. Yesterday, the news from the Southern and Northern Tunes person of this publication said that she would perform ten grand plays at a certain theater. This theater is the Xuan Palace, and the opening will be around the 10th.

### Yi Hua's Representative Work, The Assassin of the King of Qin, Approaches the Finale

Since the start of filming, all the staff of the historical epic "The Assassin of the King of Qin" have been concentrating on their work, and the results have been excellent. It is regarded as a representative work of Yi Hua Company. This film is Yan Youxiang's first time directing, and Wang Yuanlong plays Jing Ke. His deep acting skills and smooth movements are one of the most outstanding in his more than ten years of work. Zheng Xiaoyu, the pillar of China Travel, plays the role of the King of Qin, which is especially outstanding. His wild laughter and expressions are moving. Lu Ming's first time acting in a costume drama, every gesture and every step is carefully portrayed. The night before the farewell at the Yi River, the performance facing Wang Yuanlong brought the viewers to tears and excited them. At this moment, "The Assassin of the King of Qin" is coming to an end, and the earliest period to meet with fans will be during the New Year.

### Watching Zheng Jiguang's Wulongyuan

— Zhang Hong

A friend invited me to watch a stage play the other day. It was the Le Shan Society's anniversary to raise charitable funds for the Pu Shan Villa. The gathering of famous amateur actors and famous actors was very exciting. It was a pity that I arrived late and entered the theater when the Cosmo Madman was already performing and was becoming a Nansheng. After this play ended, there was a break for a few minutes. The curtain was raised, and silver shields and flower baskets were lined up on the stage. There was also a soft plaque of "Yangchun White Snow" presented by Yu Qiaqing to Zheng Jiguang and written by the calligrapher Liao Zimao hanging in the middle of the curtain. It was very eye-catching. Then the finale, the entire Wulongyuan, including the disturbances in the courtyard, writing letters, and killing the daughter-in-law, began to be performed. First, Ms. Zhang Meifang's daughter-in-law Jiao took the stage. Her stilt work was very good, and her performance was coquettish and spicy, which was quite in line with the status of the daughter-in-law. Paired with Xiao Wenlin's Zhang Wenyuan, the secret meeting scene was fragrant and sensual. Next, the famous amateur actor Zheng Jiguang played Song Jiang. Before he came on stage, he said the phrase "Please forgive me for the poor company" in the backstage, which immediately received a round of applause. When he came on stage, he sang the introduction correctly. In the courtyard scene, Song Jiang wanted to get close to his mistress Jiao, but Jiao refused, which led to an argument. Song Jiang was eventually locked out of Wulongyuan. Song Jiang went back and forth three times. The feelings were delicate, and the water sleeve skills were also excellent, which won a lot of applause. It is rare for amateur actors to achieve this. Later, he lost the gold letter in Wulongyuan and performed his anxious state. He also performed various poses when he went out before, as well as the state of Xi Jiao forcing him to write a letter of divorce, bearing humiliation and swallowing his voice in order to ask for the return of the letter. His performance was very realistic, so that those who didn't know he was an amateur actor would definitely suspect that he was an old actor. In addition, his younger brother, the famous Qin player Zheng Jianhui, played the Qin for him. His intonation was perfect and very pleasant to listen to. It can be said that he was a green leaf assisting a red flower.

### Unofficial Chronicles of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Two Foolish Young Masters in the Amateur Singing Circle of Beiping

Although he looks foolish, he is actually more clear-headed than that Fourth Master Rong. One year, he thought that there were too few people in his family, and living in a deep mansion was inconvenient for going in and out, and he had to hire many people to watch the house for nothing. He had already discussed it with his wife several times, saying that we might as well sell this big house and move into a smaller house to live in, which would save us from using so many people and worrying so much. His wife certainly agreed with him, but before selling it, he suddenly had an idea and ordered the servants to pry open the floorboards. Suddenly, a large amount of opium and gold and silver were found under the floorboards in a certain room. Opening the boxes, he realized that it was the authentic good stuff that his father had brought from Sichuan, and he had refined it all into brick-like blocks and hid it away (the named it big gold bricks in the provinces of Shaanxi and Gansu) prepared enough for him to enjoy for the rest of his life. Unexpectedly, he himself did not use much of it before he died. According to outsiders, perhaps he was afraid that his descendants would become addicted to this bad habit and harm themselves for life, so he did not explain it before he died. Furthermore, he originally had plenty of money, and the prices were low at that time. It was inconvenient to sell it, and there was no need to sell it, so he might as well keep his mouth shut. Who knew that the prices would be so high later, and that it would be impossible to get goods from the remote southwest in the north, so Zhong Si was overjoyed and feared that there might be other buried things underground, so he even canceled the idea of selling the house. Therefore, these two Fourth Masters, although they both love drama, although they both have a foolish name, and although they both have a matter of selling the house, the gains and losses of the two people are very different. "Rong" Fourth is after all "Yong" Fourth, and "Zhong" to the end is "Zhong" Fourth. Rong Fourth is too mediocre and useless, while Zhong Fourth is really useful. (156)
