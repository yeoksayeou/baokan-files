Fengcheng: The Chinese army in the Tujiapu area on the front line of the Nanxun Qian Railway has always maintained its original positions until the 26th and has repeatedly defeated stubborn enemies. However, because the front line was too prominent, there was a risk of having its rear cut off by the Japanese army from time to time. Therefore, at noon on the 26th, it moved to Lehua, concentrated its main force at a key point in a certain place, and searched forward. The scattered units of the Japanese army encountered along the way were all defeated or annihilated by the Chinese army. The battle results were extremely outstanding. By about 10 p.m. on the 26th, they had crossed a certain location separately and safely reached a certain place. On the 27th, they joined up with the reinforcements and moved into a favorable position to continue the counterattack. After a fierce battle for one day and one night, the Japanese army on the Wanjiafu to Fengxin highway was completely defeated. The remnants of the Japanese army fled in all directions north and south of the highway. The Chinese army is continuing to search and encircle them. In this battle, 400 to 500 Japanese troops were killed or wounded, and many were captured. The situation is being investigated. (Dispatch of the 28th)

(Dispatch of the 27th)

(Chongqing) Chinese military observers declared today that the battle situation in Jiangxi Province has reached a decisive stage. Both the Chinese and Japanese armies now have a large number of reserves, which can be mobilized if needed. According to news received here, a large number of Japanese troops have crossed Xiushui, which means that the first line of defense of the Chinese army has been breached. Chinese military figures admit that the Japanese mechanized troops can attack Nanchang under the cover of the air force, while other Japanese troops are simultaneously attacking Qingjiang, south of Nanchang, from Gao'an, in an attempt to cut off the rear of the Chinese army along the railway. However, the Chinese army has now mobilized a large army to attack the Japanese army from another direction, so that their strategy cannot be realized. Therefore, the Chinese army is actively advancing north of Xiushui, hoping to stop the Japanese advance and prevent the Japanese army from receiving reinforcements. Although Chinese military figures here acknowledge the seriousness of the battle situation in Nanchang, they do not believe that it is hopeless. It is said that there are only 60,000 Japanese troops in Nanchang, while the Chinese army has more than two or three times that number. Therefore, the Nanchang battle is obviously not yet at the final stage. (Dispatch of the 28th, Haitong News Agency)

Editorial

### Martyrs' Memorial Day

As you sow, so shall you reap; the overthrow of the Manchu Qing and the establishment of the Republic were by no means accidental or fortuitous. It was the result of more than 20 years of revolutionary movement, the tragic sacrifices of patriots and people of virtue, who persevered and never gave up. Their righteous voices resonated and people yearned for it; hence the fruit ripened and fell in October of Xinhai. To say that the Qing government was corrupt and the officials were greedy and the soldiers were lazy, and that it was as easy as crushing dry weeds, is simply to ignore the fact that the insurgent army was not a strong army, and the so-called people's army was not very large; it would not have been possible to succeed in one fell swoop if the revolutionary idea had not been widespread and deeply rooted in people's hearts! Before the Double Tenth, every year people suffered hardship for their words, were imprisoned for their writings, or assassinated high-ranking officials, or raised flags and advocated righteousness; all these revolutionary actions, though seemingly without any achievement, were nonetheless earth-shattering and deafening, and their effect was to spread the seeds of revolution and instill revolutionary ideas; the uprising of Xinhai broke out in Wuchang, and those who responded rose up everywhere, which was the direct factor. The most notable of these was the Guangzhou Uprising on March 29, 28 years ago; there were only a little over a hundred participants, and 72 died in the uprising. I still remember that on this day last year, those who paid their respects at Huanghuagang numbered more than 100,000 from morning till night; and every year on this day, it is the same scene; now that Yueyuan has not been recovered, we look out to the foot of Baiyun Mountain in the distance, shrouded in clouds and fog, but the towering monument still stands out in the clouds.

Whenever I read the history of the revolution, understanding why these people and their deeds were so great, and compare them with the modern world interwoven with realism, opportunism, and utilitarianism, they are completely different; I admire them as superhumans, and imagine their deeds as if they were in another universe. Those in today's world who value realism, pursue opportunity, and strive for utilitarianism take the gains and losses, fortunes and misfortunes, and difficulties and easiness of their own small selves as the standard for all actions; they act when it benefits their small selves, and they turn away when it does not. As a result, the level of social morality and international morality has plummeted, and the world is on the verge of catastrophe, which has its origins. But the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, and the countless martyrs who died for the revolution, went through fire and water without looking back, what were they doing for? They did it without considering rewards, and they did it in anonymity; they either knew that they would fail, or did not think that there would be a day of success, but regarded it as something that should be done and did it resolutely; they either deeply believed that they would eventually succeed, or knew that success would benefit everyone, but they regarded death as returning home and did it with joy without seeking to enjoy it themselves; they chose righteousness and became benevolent, for the sake of the country and the nation: how could those who pursue realism, opportunism, and utilitarianism dream of such a thing?

The spirits of the martyrs are not lost. Although the recovery of China was delayed by one or two decades, and China's national fortune was declining, it must still be attributed to the original aspirations of the martyrs who fought for the Republic; even the achievements of the past 21 months of the war of resistance, and the bright future of national reconstruction after the war of resistance, should still be credited to the martyrs. Let us imagine this: the invading country has been plotting for decades to annex China and realize its ambition of a continental policy, long before the Xinhai Revolution; if the Manchu Qing had dragged on and not perished in the Xinhai Revolution, then the invading country would not have launched its military force until the September 18th Incident of 1931, but several years earlier; wherever the invasion reached, the Manchu Qing would have no able emperors and ministers to fight, and the people would not have fought for the Manchu Qing, and based on their ideology of "rather give to foreign friends than to domestic slaves," they would have paid tribute and become vassals, following in the footsteps of Korea; how could there have been any room for resistance as there is today? Therefore, it was the martyrs who destroyed the Manchu Qing; it was also the martyrs who created the opportunity for the nation to revive. Not only that, but the Manchu Qing dynasty of more than 200 years, from the palace to the petty officials, was base and lowly, and gradually there was hardly any integrity in the court or in the people; those who fought in the court and those who fought among the people were all about opportunity and utilitarianism. Fortunately, the revolutionary martyrs fully displayed the spirit of dedication to the nation, and demonstrated the model of sacrificing oneself in action; so that the culture of wisdom, benevolence, and courage of the nation for 5,000 years did not become extinct. Look at the 21 months of the war of resistance. The generals and soldiers on the front line went through fire and water without looking back; the people in the rear were also able to encourage each other to sacrifice for the country; such a scene was absolutely unimaginable under the rule of the Manchu Qing, but every one of them followed in the footsteps of the martyrs of that year, and was able to shine before and after! Therefore, the deeds of the revolutionary martyrs were in the Xinhai era and before and after, and their spirit of inspiring the nation will last forever.

### Northeast Guerrilla Force Has Strong Strength, Activity Area Has Reached More Than Sixty Districts, Japanese Army Launches Large-Scale Attacks Without Gaining Anything

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources familiar with the current military situation in the Northeast, while the Japanese army is conducting a "suppression" guerrilla movement in North China, the Kwantung Army is also conducting a "suppression" guerrilla movement in the eastern three provinces. The Chinese guerrilla forces in the three eastern provinces are mostly local farmers, and have recently been reorganized into 50,000 regular troops and 100,000 "farmers' self-defense forces." During combat, the "farmers' self-defense forces" are led by the regular troops. The 50,000 regular troops are divided into 12 armies of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army, which are directly controlled by the Northeast Military Commission, and the Northeast Military Commission is directly under the Military Commission in Chongqing. Li Du, a famous anti-Japanese general who was recently appointed as the chairman of Jilin Province and the chairman of the Northeast Military Commission, will soon leave Chongqing to take office. According to what he told reporters, the Twelfth Army was formed half a year ago by the Eighth Route Army that entered the four eastern provinces from eastern Hebei, and is now active in southern Rehe, destroying the railway between Jinzhou and Rehe. The Twelfth Army has a total of 3,000 troops and is still in contact with the Eighth Route Army in North China. The Second Army is Korean and was reorganized from the "China-Korea Anti-Japanese Allied Army" that was previously active in the three eastern provinces and Korea. Its area of activity has been extended to various counties in northern Korea. The remaining armies are active in the areas of Hunchun and Dongning on the border between Jilin and the Soviet Union. Almost all of the mountainous areas in eastern Jilin are in the hands of the Chinese guerrilla forces. The area of activity of the Chinese guerrilla forces occupies more than 60 districts in the eastern three provinces. The Japanese army has designated many "bandit areas" in the eastern three provinces, and strictly prohibits the supply of goods. Travelers from "bandit areas" are also strictly inspected, with the aim of using economic blockade and military action to "suppress" the Chinese guerrilla forces. In the past two months, the Japanese army has mobilized 35,000 troops to "suppress" the Chinese guerrilla forces, but the results have been nil. According to Japanese announcements, in the two months up to December 15 last year, the Japanese army in the "Sanjiang Province" of "Manchukuo" had 321 fierce battles with the Chinese guerrilla forces. At present, the Japanese Kwantung Army has a total of 250,000 troops, and the puppet army has 150,000 troops, most of whom are stationed on the Soviet border to prevent the Soviet army from attacking. Therefore, the Japanese have a total of 400,000 regular troops in "Manchukuo." (American dispatch of the 28th) Foreign Secretary Butler reported in the House of Commons

### Joint Telegram from Chinese University Presidents to the U.S. Congress Requesting Discrimination Between Aggressor and Victim Nations When Considering Amendments to the Chinese Exclusion Act

(Chongqing) According to an official announcement today, seventeen Chinese university presidents jointly sent a telegram to the U.S. Congress today, requesting that they distinguish between aggressors and victims when considering amendments to the Chinese Exclusion Act. The gist is as follows: We earnestly request that, when drafting a new Chinese Exclusion Act, you must, based on humanitarianism and justice, distinguish between aggressors and victims. This new Chinese Exclusion Act should include practical measures to provide assistance to the victims. Without the above provisions, measures in the Chinese Exclusion Act to curb the war will only make it extremely difficult for China to resist Japanese aggression. This is because China has neither a navy nor merchant ships, and therefore has no way to utilize the "cash and carry" clause. This move would only disadvantage China and encourage Japan.

### British Foreign Secretary Receives Chinese Ambassador to Discuss Far East Situation British Ambassadors to China and Japan to Meet in Shanghai, Worth Watching

(London) Yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Halifax received the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, for half an hour. The content seemed to be about the expansion of German power and the fact that Britain and France have no time to look east, which will make it easier for Japan to act in China.

### The Times Attaches Importance to the Chinese Government Maintaining Creditworthiness Saying It Is a Good Omen

(London) The city editor of The Times drew general attention to the exciting effect of public anger in China since the Chinese government announced that the interest coupons on Crisp and Sino-French bonds would be paid on schedule. He said, "The full payment of these interest coupons is indeed a good omen, because loans secured by salt revenue are naturally considered to be superior to loans secured by customs duties. If we feel that there is any possibility of delay in the repayment of customs-guaranteed loans due in July, then at a minimum, it can be reasonably determined that it is currently impossible to fully repay the aforementioned interest coupons."

### A True Record of the Fierce Fighting in Northern Jiangxi in the Last Two Weeks The Japanese Army Launched a Large-Scale Invasion with Heavy Troops on Land, Sea, and Air Casualties Exceeded 15,000, Which Was Not Originally Expected

Pingjiang: The situation on the northern Jiangxi front, which had been quiet for a month, suddenly turned tense. Over the past month, the Japanese army has been continuously adding troops to the south, with a total of four divisions having been identified. It is generally believed that they must have new plans in that direction. Because of this, the reporter crossed the curtain and passed through Wuning in a car a few days ago to inspect the front line. Along the way, the wheat seedlings were lush, the willow branches were drooping, and a hundred flowers were waiting to bloom. It was truly the return of spring to the earth.

After four months of training, the Chinese army has new vitality. The Xiu River, also known as the West River, originates from Mount Mufu and flows east to Wucheng, where it joins the Gan River and enters Poyang Lake. It is 500 miles long. Wucheng is separated from Xingzi and Duchang by the lake, forming a strategic triangle. It is the inner gateway to Poyang Lake. Although Xingzi was lost last autumn, the Japanese army still has Duchang and Wucheng in our hands, and Poyang Lake is still under our control. On the 13th of the month, the enemy used two warships and two planes each to cover 300 to 400 Japanese troops and first invaded Pingshan, 20 kilometers northwest of Duchang.

At dawn on the 14th, they again used three warships and nine steamships, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, to land on the west bank of Xingzi City, at Laoye Temple and Dashishan, three kilometers west of Duchang. In total, the Japanese army attacked Dashishan three times, and all three times they were bravely repulsed by our counterattacks. The intensity of the fighting and the ferocity of the sacrifices were truly unprecedented. General Wang, who commanded the Chinese army on that line, wrote a seven-character quatrain when he recovered Dashishan on the 17th, which included the line "Ten thousand troops clapped their hands in unison, Wang Lang seized the eldest sister back" (Dajie is a homophone for Dashishan and is used here as a metaphor). The Japanese army's dream of invading Duchang has been completely shattered by the Chinese side.

Because the Japanese army's invasion of Duchang was unsuccessful, they shifted their forces to harass Wucheng. Since the morning of the 17th, they have used more than 20 warships and 40 steamships every day, under the cover of crazy bombing by enemy aircraft, attempting to forcibly land in Wucheng in order to achieve their goal of controlling Poyang Lake and then transferring to the Xiu River and Gan River. However, after three days of such fierce attacks, the Japanese side gained nothing, and instead sank one warship and more than ten steamships, with casualties of 400 to 500 officers and soldiers. The Japanese military has always preferred to attack where defenses are weak. So from this point on, in addition to continuing to try to land on Songmenshan, Hexilong, and other piles, they also shifted their main force to the Yongxiu area on the north bank of the Xiu River to prepare to cross the river. Furthermore, a portion of their troops was divided into two routes, one westward and one southward, to block our left-wing troops from moving east and to attack their flanks.

In the afternoon of the 21st, the Japanese army took advantage of some kind of relationship to cross the Xiu River east of Qiujin, and proceeded directly along the highway from Gouziling and Xiongliuzhuang to Tanxi. They were resisted by our Chinese army and failed to move south. On the morning of the 22nd, the Japanese army, under the cover of artillery, erected a pontoon bridge between Zhanggongbo and Qiujin. At the same time, a unit of infantry, covered by twenty or thirty tanks and many armored vehicles, launched a large-scale attack across the river to the south. They also deployed balloons that rose high into the air to indicate the direction of artillery fire. The frontal troops still fought bravely in the face of the Japanese army's combined land and air attacks. Therefore, although the invading Japanese army occupied Anyi by the evening of the 23rd, in the battle of Mantou Mountain north of the city, more than 2,000 people, including the commander of the Japanese Iino Regiment, mostly achieved the "silent triumph" that the Japanese army spoke of. On the same day, another unit of the Japanese army, via the Tanxi Shangu Avenue, passed through Long'an Bridge and Baitianpu, and harassed Fengxin via Anyi and Jing'an. They were intercepted by a certain Chinese elite force and completely repulsed.

On the 24th, the Japanese army attacked Jing'an with one unit and Fengxin with the main force. After achieving the glorious battle result of killing another regimental commander Miyazaki and other officers and soldiers, the Chinese army abandoned its defense. At this time, on the right flank, in the Wucheng area, the Japanese army landed successively on Songmenshan, Hexilong, and Yejiazhou, and advanced towards Wucheng Town in several directions. The town has been subjected to crazy bombardment by the Japanese army's naval, land, and air artillery fire for a week. All 20,000 houses in the town (Wucheng is one of the four major towns in Jiangxi Province) have been reduced to ashes, and all fortifications have been destroyed. However, the loyal and brave Chinese Regiment XX and Regiment XX, after suffering heavy casualties, still used the ruins as cover and calmly resisted. Until dawn on the 24th, because the front was too prominent, they received orders to join the troops at Tujiapu and Wanjiafu and retreat to the line of Fengan Changbu Street. On the morning of the 25th, the Japanese troops from Fengxin and Anyi simultaneously attacked Gao'an, Nanchang, and Lehua. The two wings of the Japanese army moving south towards Gao'an were intercepted by a certain Chinese loyal army in front of Dacheng Village Qianjie. At this point, the Japanese army turned east and joined the troops moving south from Lehua to attempt to capture Nanchang. A fierce battle, unprecedented since the Battle of Wuhan, was fiercely launched in the Gan River Delta area. In the afternoon of the 26th, after releasing a large amount of poison gas, the Japanese army attempted to forcibly cross the Gan River at Shengmi Street to continue attacking the flanks of Nanchang.

In summary, the Japanese army's attack on Nanchang this time has lasted less than half a month, but the number of divisions used, as far as has been discovered, is five divisions. In addition to the naval landing force, the actual strength is more than three divisions. Casualties were heavy, exceeding 15,000 people. This is what the Japanese army has been broadcasting recently as comparable to the Battle of Luxembourg in the European War, which was certainly not originally expected. The implication is that the losses outweigh the gains. As for the Wuning area in the upper reaches of the Xiu River, the Chinese army has repeatedly won victories in counterattacks. The Japanese army has not been able to advance further on the Hunan-Jiangxi Highway, and the isolated army on Mount Lu is constantly attacking the rear of the Japanese army, and may even be cut off.

### Franco-Italian Dispute Negotiation Door Has Been Opened French Premier to Clarify Stance Today Laval's Trip to Rome Unconfirmed

(Berlin) Since the beginning of this week, the European political situation has been relatively quiet. Reports received by the German Foreign Office from representatives stationed abroad all state that there are no disturbances. It is said that although the government has resigned in Lithuania, the atmosphere is calmer than before. The movement of troops in Poland has been reduced to a minimum. All German countermeasures have been recognized by us. News has also come from the Swiss side that the anxiety caused by the news that German troops were concentrated near the border has been alleviated. (Reuter dispatch from the 27th)

(Paris) Most members of the French cabinet today seem to believe that Mussolini's speech has opened the door to Franco-Italian negotiations to resolve issues such as Djibouti, the Suez Canal, and Tunisia. The ministers exchanged views and held meetings all day today, and as a result, adopted this attitude. However, as for the negotiations, the cabinet has not yet issued a statement. People here believe that Foreign Minister Bonnet may resign so that he can negotiate with Italy on its demands as soon as possible. Bonnet does not approve of the policy of reconciliation, but his name cannot be separated from French foreign policy, so the Rome-Berlin axis no longer trusts him. (Associated Press dispatch from the 27th)

(Paris) According to French Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday, France is prepared to discuss any diplomatic proposals with Italy in order to resolve the Mediterranean issue. Bonnet said that although Mussolini's speech during Fascist Commemoration Week has opened the door to Franco-Italian negotiations, it has not yet mentioned the basis for the negotiations. French Premier Daladier is currently drafting a speech to the Chamber of Deputies tomorrow, which will state that although France is willing to negotiate with Italy to establish a political understanding, France is determined not to cede an inch of land. (Associated Press dispatch from the 28th)

(Paris) According to well-informed sources, if the Italian government expresses its readiness to negotiate and clearly stipulates the matters to be negotiated, then France intends to conduct decision-making. The various points that should be discussed regarding Djibouti, the Suez Canal, and Tunisia, although they do not have to be included in the true structure of the 1935 Franco-Italian agreement, cannot be far from this basis. France is not prepared to restore the status of Italians in Tunisia under the 1896 treaty unless the Italian side indicates that it will follow this approach. Otherwise, it would be useless for the country to engage in negotiations, because if they fail, the current situation will worsen. (Reuter dispatch from the 27th)

(Paris) It is rumored here that former French Prime Minister Laval has now gone to Rome to inquire about the exact scope of Italy's requirements. The general public, given that Laval was the signatory of the 1935 Franco-Italian agreement, attaches great significance to the above rumors. According to people in the Senate lounge, the Senate has heard rumors last week that if the government gives Laval full authority, Laval is prepared to go to Rome in the near future. Since then, rumors have spread, giving the opposition party a handle to attack Laval. Diplomatic sources pointed out that Laval is the spokesman for the French financial community and strongly opposes France's armed conflict with any country. Therefore, it is generally believed that if Laval's opinion indirectly reflects the attitude of the French external, then Laval can gain Mussolini's trust. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)

(Paris) Regarding the rumors that France has sent Senator and former Prime Minister Laval to Italy, the authorities have not yet confirmed it. According to people close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, if France is willing to conduct diplomatic negotiations based on the points raised in Mussolini's speech, then logically, it should instruct the ambassador stationed in Italy to conduct it. Political figures and public opinion have expressed their opinions on Franco-Italian diplomatic negotiations, saying that before France begins to join the negotiations, it must know the true content of Italy's demands. It should be noted that Mussolini's note delivered on November 17 of last year, in its content, in addition to repeating the old text of the 1935 Laval-Mussolini Agreement, has no specific expression. What benefit is there in the matter? The French newspapers generally advocate that the Italian side should first make a statement on the negotiations. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)

(Paris) French Congressman Gruber, just now submitted a request to the Chamber of Deputies to publish the letters exchanged between former Prime Minister Laval and Mussolini at the beginning of the 1935 Abyssinian War. According to Gruber, Laval stated in the letter that France approved of Italy's war against Abyssinia. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)

### Gayda's Thesis Explains Wishes German Newspaper Speaks for Italy German Newspaper Speaks for Italy

(Rome) Gayda, the chief writer of the Italian News, published an article in the newspaper yesterday, giving a detailed elaboration on Mussolini's speech the day before. He said, "The Prime Minister's speech can be regarded as the policy of the Italian Empire, and can also be regarded as the formula for European peace. The key to its peace plan is that each country should revise the status quo and obtain the territory that each country deserves in a spirit of fairness without violating historical basis. To realize this plan, there is no need to resort to force, and mutual understanding is sufficient to achieve results. No one wants war, and even totalitarian countries want world peace so that they can engage in construction work. The demands put forward by Italy are completely consistent with the rights stipulated in the London Agreement. Italy's demands on France do not incite war." Gayda sharply criticized those French people who still hold a tough attitude after Mussolini's speech. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)

(Paris) Newspapers here continued to comment on the international situation, paying close attention to the speech delivered by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini a few days ago. The Paris Echo reported, "The writings published by Gayda, the spokesman for the Italian Prime Minister, in recent days are no less important in nature than the Italian Prime Minister's speech. Gayda has explained the ambitions of Italy." The newspaper also carried a telegram from a Copenhagen correspondent in Denmark saying that there are rumors that Germany has certain intentions for Iceland, which is noteworthy. The Daily reported, "If it is said that diplomatically, there is no other way to invite the Italian government to explain its intentions for Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal than to conduct formal negotiations with Italy, it is not entirely true. But if you ask about Germany's intentions for the Free City of Danzig, then only one person can answer, and that is Hitler. The Danzig issue is more serious than the Memel issue, because what is involved in this matter is Poland, not an isolated and helpless Lithuania." The Little Daily reported, "Regarding the Tunisia issue, we must point out that there are still 2.5 million people living there, who are neither French nor Italian. These people (referring to the natives) naturally have the right to speak on all issues involving the land where they live and work." The Little Parisian reported, "Our government has sent Ambassador Ponsot to Rome, and the Italian government has sent Ambassador Garriglia to Paris. We think it is time for the ambassadors sent by both sides to be allowed to do something." The Radical Socialist Party's business newspaper reported, "We are neither hostile to other countries nor deliberately deaf, but we believe that we have the right to be cautious." A right-wing French Action reported, "Does Italian Prime Minister Mussolini want to see Germany's power expand endlessly? Does he believe that Italy will not suffer the consequences one day?" The Times reported that there are countless German delegations in Italy participating in various activities. German Air Force Commander General Maedde and Aviation Minister General Goering even regard Italy as their common hometown. On this day when Fascism has repeatedly won victories, the Fascist front may not give people a chance to take advantage of it. (Havas dispatch from the 28th)

(Berlin) The "People's Observer," the mouthpiece of the National Socialist Party's central organ, recently published an article expressing its approval of the three points raised by Mussolini in his speech the day before: Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal. The newspaper also published a front-page article criticizing France's evasive attitude, saying that the French dignitaries imagine that Italy will abandon its axis policy, which is really incomprehensible. It is not clear on what basis this statement is made. The French people's reaction to Mussolini's speech reveals this kind of fantasy about German-Italian common goals. The newspaper continued to comment on Mussolini's demands, saying that Mussolini's demands are very moderate and there is no reason to call them blackmail by a threatening politician. Fascist Italy cannot be compared with "Italy in 1881. Italy's demands are based on the colonial guarantees provided by Britain and France in 1915. Britain has already expressed its intention to fulfill its promises, while France refuses to make any concessions. However, today's Italy has seen its manpower and national power increase day by day, so it is necessary to expand its territory. (Haitong dispatch from the 28th)

### Paying Attention to the Development of the European Situation British and American Close Contact British and American Close Contact Britain Not Considering Economic Sanctions Against Germany

(Washington) Government officials reported today that the United States is currently in close discussions with Britain regarding the recent developments in Europe. U.S. Ambassador to Britain Kennedy visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday and then consulted with British Prime Minister Chamberlain. (Associated Press dispatch from the 28th)

(London) When Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler attended the House of Commons yesterday, the Labor Party advocated taking economic isolation as a retaliatory measure against those who "disrupt world peace." Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler stated that the government could not consider this policy because the conditions for cooperation between the United States and the League of Nations did not include this point. He also said that the possibility of the British government imposing economic isolation on Germany is extremely small. The British government did not protest against Germany's annexation of Memel. According to British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Romania had notified Britain that the trade agreement signed with Germany did not have any political clauses attached. As for the means of economic isolation, he also did not see any use for it. (Associated Press dispatch from the 28th)

(Washington) State Department officials recently stated that the U.S. government has never exchanged views with other governments regarding the imposition of economic sanctions on Germany. Although it had previously told the League of Nations that it was prepared to participate in the League of Nations' activities economically when answering inquiries from the League of Nations, it did not involve political issues.

(London) The Polish Embassy here has formally denied rumors that Germany has issued a note to Poland demanding the return of the Free City of Danzig and the construction of a highway through the Polish Corridor. However, well-informed sources here still state that the German government has recently concentrated troops in the border areas near Poland, causing external anxiety. The Polish government has also mobilized approximately one million people to warn Germany that Poland will not become another Czechoslovakia under any circumstances. Furthermore, General Smigly-Rydz, Inspector General of the Polish Army, is determined to defend territorial integrity, alleviating public concerns. According to certain figures in British political circles, the Polish government is secretly negotiating with Germany, and a friendly solution to the Danzig issue may be announced before Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's visit to Britain next month. (Havas Telegram, 27th)

### After 28 Months of Siege, Madrid Garrison Finally Surrenders; Nationalist Troops Enter the City without Resistance; Fascist Salutes Visible Everywhere; Government Personnel Retreat to Valencia

Madrid After being besieged by Nationalist forces for over 28 months and withstanding no fewer than five major offensives, Madrid has surrendered today, after enduring thousands of Nationalist artillery shells and bombs and attacks by elite infantry. White flags were initially displayed in the city, indicating the surrender of the Madrid Defense Committee to General Franco. Last night, government troops withdrew from all front lines into the city. Today, there is no trace of government troops in the city. General Casado, the military and political chief of the Defense Committee, issued a pre-emptive radio broadcast stating that the Defense Committee urgently desired a ceasefire and that anti-fascists on all fronts had withdrawn, and the mobilized conscripts had been ordered to demobilize. Defense Committee member Marin also broadcast on the government radio, saying, "The Defense Committee has cooperated with all parties to prepare for the evacuation of all those whose lives are threatened by the invaders," and instructed everyone not to abandon their positions. For the first time since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War on July 17, 1936, the Spanish national flag appeared on the roof of the 14-story telephone company building, riddled with bullet holes. The first unit of Nationalist troops entered the city from northern Madrid after 11:00 this morning, encountering no resistance. (Associated Press Telegram, 28th)

Madrid Madrid has surrendered after being besieged for two and a half years, with white flags hanging everywhere. However, it is not yet known when Franco's troops will enter the city. Colonel Casado, leader of the Defense Committee, has left headquarters, and the central troops, under the command of Colonel Prada, have surrendered. It is widely believed that Franco will enter Madrid on April 1st. Although the news of Madrid's surrender has not been officially announced, the Nationalist arm salute is visible everywhere. The news of the surrender spread quickly, and the disappearance of the Republican flag seemed like magic. All the exits of the city are crowded with refugees, who are desperately trying to escape for fear of retaliation. However, due to the lack of gasoline, there are very few cars. The streets are filled with soldiers retreating from the front lines. Shops have refused to accept Republican banknotes. Republican leader Colonel Casado left the city before Madrid surrendered, and his whereabouts are unknown. Police stand by and do not interfere as supporters of the Nationalists hold demonstrations. Nationalist troops are now approaching Madrid. (Reuters Telegram, 28th)

(London) Reuters has received reliable information that Spanish militiamen will begin occupying Madrid at 5:00 AM this morning. The first troops to enter the city will be from the contingent transferred from the University City. Troops from the north, south, and west will converge at the Puerta del Sol. (Reuters Telegram, 28th)

Madrid The city of Madrid surrendered to the Nationalist forces this morning. The Republican government's Minister of Defense, General Casado, and all cabinet members have left for other locations. Government troops on the front lines have all raised white flags, and all soldiers have left their trenches and retreated into the city. Nationalist flags are hanging everywhere in the city, and pedestrians are using the fascist salute. Most residents are trying to flee to the port of Valencia, but due to the lack of gasoline, they cannot use cars and have to leave the city on foot, which is quite a mess. (Havas Telegram, 28th)

(Paris) According to a telegram received here, the members of the Spanish Defense Committee have arrived in Valencia and are holding a meeting under the chairmanship of General Miaja. (Reuters Telegram, 28th)

### Nationalist Elite Troops Attack Madrid Across 300-Li Front

Burgos General Franco's offensive line against Madrid extends for 300 kilometers. Yesterday was the second day of the general offensive, with forces near Toledo advancing northeast along the Tagus River and Jarama River, directly towards Albacete. The Madrid front is bounded by the Manzanares River, and Nationalist troops are advancing using important strongholds near Campo, Fuencarral, and Aravaca. On the western side of the Madrid front, Nationalist troops have occupied Brunete, the site of fierce fighting in the summer of 1937. Southwest of the Escorial front, Nationalist troops have approached the Sierra de Guadarrama, which is connected to the highway between Madrid and Valladolid, 55 to 80 kilometers from Madrid. General Franco fought fiercely in the mountainous area near there several times in March 1937. (Haitong Telegram, 28th)

Toledo General Franco is now at the Toledo front, commanding 100,000 fully equipped troops, including a mechanized unit, in a general offensive. General Varela's Maestrazgo troops and General Solchaga's Navarre troops launched a joint offensive against government troop positions 15 kilometers south of Toledo yesterday, breaking through the line between Guadamar and Agés. After General Puente led his troops across the Tagus River, they continued to advance towards Ventosilla. General Varela's troops advanced 10 kilometers and occupied the high ground controlling Toledo, bringing its artillery within 50 kilometers of Toledo. Due to the government troops' scarcity of guns and cannons, no Nationalist soldiers were killed or injured in this offensive. Only a donkey was injured and died. It is expected that Nationalist troops will encircle the city of Madrid in the next few days. (Haitong Telegram, 28th)

### Famous Mercury Mining Area Falls into Nationalist Hands

Burgos Almadén, a town of 9,850 residents, is the site of the world's largest mercury mine and has been famous since ancient times. Since the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, the town has been occupied by Republican forces, but it has now been occupied by Nationalist forces. According to witnesses, the Republican resistance in the past 24 hours was not as intense as on the first day of the new offensive. (Reuters Telegram, 28th)

### The Changing Situation in Spain is Difficult to Understand; Possibly Due to Foreign Interference, Which Could Affect Franco-Italian Relations

(Paris) Political figures here have commented on the surrender of Madrid to Nationalist forces. The course of events is difficult to understand. Although the fall of Madrid was expected, the breakdown of peace negotiations between the Republican government and the Nationalist government was likely due to foreign interference. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini seems to have pressured General Franco not to reconcile with the Republican government and to insist on the Republican government's unconditional surrender. The Nationalist troops, including Italian troops, entered the city of Madrid with great fanfare. This can be seen by the fact that the day the peace negotiations broke down was also the day Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech announcing that Spanish Nationalist troops would enter the city of Madrid. However, the surrender of Madrid may immediately affect the situation in the Mediterranean. Prime Minister Mussolini once said that there is an "obstacle" between France and Italy. Once the Spanish issue is resolved, this obstacle can be removed. However, if the Nationalist government joins the Anti-Comintern Pact, the relationship between Spain and Germany and Italy will increase to a certain extent, causing a fatal blow to Franco-Italian relations and eliminating any hope of reconciliation. This is very worrying. (Havas Telegram, 28th)

### Spanish Ambassador to Britain May Be Recalled

(London) It is rumored that the Duke of Alba, the ambassador of the Spanish Nationalist government (who has not yet presented his credentials), may be recalled. Political figures here have expressed concern upon hearing this, stating that this may be a prelude to the country joining the Anti-Comintern Pact. In this regard, British Ambassador to the Spanish Nationalist government Sir Peterson visited Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax yesterday and will travel to Burgos in the near future to take up his post, attempting to persuade Nationalist leader General Franco not to join the Anti-Comintern Pact.

### Implementing Conscription

(London) Former Naval Minister Toughought delivered a speech today at Caxton Hall, advocating for a united front against dictatorial nations and supporting the implementation of conscription. He stated that Germany has removed its mask, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in his recent speech, once again advocated for a permanent peace that is inherently prone to causing harm. The dictatorial leaders, especially Hitler, have made their desire to control Europe and the world through force abundantly clear. Now is the time for all nations to rise up and resist. "I believe war can still be avoided, but only if nations take swift, resolute, and united action." As for Britain, I advocate for forming a smaller cabinet to expedite action. "After the establishment of this cabinet, all important measures related to national security can be put into practice. In short, a system where all citizens participate in service according to their strengths can be implemented. I am not saying that all citizens must wear uniforms or that all young people must join the army, but the nation must have the right to demand military service from all able-bodied men in times of crisis. This principle must be thoroughly implemented. I also believe that once this is achieved, it will have a significant impact on world opinion," he said. (Havas News Agency, 27th)

Hong Kong Correspondence: The war in Guangdong Province has been stalemated for the past ten days. The Japanese army's attempt to invade Hainan Island failed, and they have been unable to penetrate deeply and eliminate the Chinese army units. They have only established defensive fortifications in several counties, including Haikou, Chengmai, and Wenchang. On one hand, they are replenishing their troops. Recently, several transport ships have arrived, and reinforcements have landed in Haikou, totaling six to seven thousand men. According to those who have just escaped from Hainan, the Japanese army was severely defeated by the Chinese army in Longmen City, Ding'an County, suffering over a thousand casualties. Since that battle, the Japanese army in Lingao, Qiongshan, Chengmai, and Wenchang has had its morale dampened. Chinese aircraft have repeatedly bombed Japanese military camps in Haikou, Wenchang, and Ding'an, destroying their defensive fortifications. Also, before the Japanese army attacked Chengmai, the main force of the Chinese army withdrew in advance and set an ambush in front of the county. The Japanese army, under the cover of air power, advanced rapidly and set up camp in Nanjiao City, north of the county. In the evening, the Chinese army launched a surprise attack. The Japanese army was caught off guard and trampled on each other, resulting in over a hundred casualties. The regimental commander, Kyota, also died in the camp, and a large amount of supplies and military equipment was lost. Currently, many of the Japanese soldiers stationed in various places are unable to acclimatize to the local conditions, and many are dying from disease. At the same time, the miscellaneous troops forced to come south have no intention of fighting and often defect in groups, surrendering to the local forces with their weapons. The Japanese leaders are now paying extreme attention, either driving these troops to the front lines or not issuing them ammunition, fearing that they might mutiny.

Japanese Army Attempts to Invade Haikang

Since the Japanese army on the island does not dare to penetrate deeply, on the one hand, it is urgently setting up defensive fortifications, appearing to be shifting to a defensive posture. However, at the same time, the number of Japanese warships in the Haikou area has not decreased, and they are constantly watching the Leizhou Peninsula and the Qinzhou-Lianzhou coast. They have also sent dozens of rubber boats to the waters off Xuwen to survey the depth. Small warships have also secretly sailed to the small islands of Dianbai and Shuidong to plunder food and fresh water. They chase and capture fishing boats, burn the boats, and drown the fishermen. As for Haikang in Leizhou, its terrain is more important than Xuwen. The Japanese army's attempt to spy on Xuwen is purely a feint to the east while attacking the west. In reality, it seems to aim to invade Haikang. Haikang is the transportation hub for entering Lianjiang, and the Kang River is the land transportation hub from Gaozhou-Leizhou to Qinzhou-Lianzhou. Moreover, it can follow the highway to the Guangxi cities of Luchuan and Yulin, as well as Leizhou and Qinzhou-Lianzhou, making it nothing less than the vanguard line of Guangxi Province. The Guangxi army has recently stationed heavy troops here, and the Guangdong Self-Defense Corps is jointly holding various sections. Recently, Qu Shounian's division of the Guangxi military region has been completely transferred to southern Guangdong, and two other divisions have also been sent to deploy defenses. The highways connecting the coast to the interior have all been destroyed. Bai Chongxi, director of the Southwest Theater of Operations of the Military Affairs Commission, believes that the status of southern Guangdong is important. Although the generals of the various armies have made comprehensive plans for national defense matters, he is still afraid that even the most meticulous plans may have oversights. He has recently dispatched a staff delegation from the Theater of Operations to Lianzhou to first inspect the coastal fortresses and strongholds. If they believe that any additions or changes should be made, they will consult with the local senior officers to quickly improve them. It is reported that the staff delegation is an organization established during wartime and will be permanently stationed at the front, liaising with military officers and providing advice on military matters.

The People of Xuwen Share a Common Hatred for the Enemy. The able-bodied men of Xuwen, Haikang, and Suixi counties on the Leizhou Peninsula are currently being concentrated for training. Xuwen has the largest number, with no less than 60,000 men. Xuwen has recently been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft. Up to now, a total of 1,416 houses have been destroyed in the county. Among them, the disaster area in Nanmentang is the largest, with 1,170 houses destroyed in the field and 44 shops on the main street. A total of 315 households have been left homeless and are currently being rescued by local organizations. They have also submitted a request to the provincial authorities for disaster relief for the refugees. The able-bodied men of the affected families are furious at the cruelty of the Japanese and are all determined to join the Self-Defense Corps to fight the Japanese to the end and avenge the destruction of their families. (21st) Jinshan Correspondence: The Japanese army in Songjiang, in order to clear the way to Zhangyan and Langxia and relieve the siege of Pinghu, dispatched over 400 men from a small regiment on seven motorboats the day before yesterday. They joined forces with the Japanese army from Songyin and Tinglin, attempting to sweep away the Chinese 45th Brigade's base in Qianjiawei in one fell swoop. The Chinese 45th Brigade at that location has over 2,000 men, a sufficient force. Originally, they were taking over the defense from Ding Xishan's Loyal National Salvation Army. After the Japanese army arrived, the Chinese army immediately rose up to resist. Jiaogang, Bochi Temple, and Tang Bridge were the areas where the two armies fought fiercely. All the villages in the area were burned down by the Japanese army. During the fierce fighting, farmers hid in the rapeseed fields and were killed by machine gun stray bullets, numbering over a dozen. The fierce fighting lasted for about a day. In the end, the Japanese army gradually became unsustainable and retreated to Songyin and Tinglin, suffering many casualties. Three motorboats were sunk. Qianjiawei and the areas to its north and south remained unscathed. Four brave soldiers in the Chinese army who fought valiantly have been recommended by the brigade commander to Cai Xiren, commander of the Songhu Garrison, for commendation and promotion.

An Overview of Our Army's Operations and Achievements: In other words, what was the process of our operations and battles in 1938?

First, our operations can be divided into two stages. In terms of time, although 1938 was a full year, in the twelve months, due to our reorganization, concentration, advancement, and deployment, the actual time of operation, considering the area north of the Yangtze River, was only seven and a half months. In the area south of the Yangtze River, it was only six and a half months. In just over half a year, the process of our operations can generally be divided into two stages.

A. Our offensive, our active offensive. Within this active offensive stage, it can be further divided into two parts: First, the situation in the Jiangnan area was very chaotic before our troops entered, especially with many undisciplined guerrilla forces. These forces not only failed to carry out the task of resisting the war and cooperating with the national operations in various areas, but on the contrary, they hindered the development of the resistance war in this area, helping Japanese imperialism to maintain transportation and governance. Therefore, the first step of our army was to remove the obstacles to our powerful and direct offensive against Japanese imperialism, disbanding or reorganizing the guerrilla forces that hindered the people's resistance war. After we began to arrive in this area, we first disarmed Zhu Yongxiang, Chen Degong, and other guerrilla commanders, whom the Jiangnan people called "Little Japanese," and some were transferred back to the rear for reorganization. The removal of these obstacles greatly benefited the Jiangnan operations. At the same time, because there was no formal Chinese army insisting on fighting in this area when we entered the operational area, and instead there were some bad guerrilla forces, it led to the development of the Jiangnan puppet regime. It can be said that, except for the areas where the power of Japanese imperialism could not reach, puppet regimes were universally established. Precisely because the development of these puppet maintenance societies hindered the unfolding of the Jiangnan people's resistance war and the improvement of the broad masses' anti-war emotions, it was necessary to eliminate these maintenance societies and puppet regimes. This was the only way to mobilize the Jiangnan people from their depressed emotions and obstacles to actively participate in the resistance war and develop the Jiangnan anti-war situation. This is the first part of the first stage.

The second part is a comprehensive offensive against the Japanese invaders. Subsequently, when Xuzhou fell and the enemy actively attacked Wuhan, we made our best efforts and fought fiercely on the Jiangnan battlefield to carry out the battle to defend Wuhan, cooperating with the friendly forces around Wuhan to achieve the task of defending Wuhan. The offensive at this time can be divided into two aspects: on the one hand, towards both sides of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, and on the other hand, towards the Nanjing-Wuhu Railway. This is the railway aspect. On the highway, towards the Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway and the area between the Nanjing-Shanghai and Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highways. Since June 18th, many battles of all sizes have been fought in Jiangnan, such as the battles of Weigang, Zhuzigang, Xintang, Xiashu, Xintang, Shidong, and Xixie Village, the battle of Qilinmen in Nanjing, the attack on Sijing, the attack on Jurong, and the attack on Jiangning Station. These battles of all sizes were all our firm offensives against the enemy in the first stage of the operation, beginning to cooperate in defending Xuzhou and continuing to cooperate in defending Greater Wuhan. From June 18th to the beginning of September was our stage of active offensive, a stage of resolute offensive.

B. The second stage was that our offensive forced the enemy to adopt a defensive posture. They had to launch a counter-offensive against our offensive. After September 10th, the enemy began to launch a five-pronged attack on Baoyan, in the area between Zhenjiang and Danyang. Later, the enemy abandoned Yicheng, Liyang, and other places, concentrated their forces to bypass between Nanjing and Shanghai, and began their offensive against us. Why did the enemy want to counter-attack? We say there are three reasons: (1) Due to the active offensive of our army in the Jiangnan area for three months, the enemy's Nanjing and Zhenjiang felt threatened. Nanjing and Zhenjiang are strategic points and hubs for the enemy's operations in the south, and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is the lifeline of transportation. Under our sabotage and attacks, the enemy's transportation on the Nanjing-Shanghai and Nanjing-Wuhu lines was greatly hindered. Our people often went to Nanjing city to cause disturbances, which threatened the Japanese invaders. In order to eliminate these threats, they had to counter-attack us. (2) In the Jiangnan theater, the task we undertook was only one-quarter of the guerrilla area. On the one hand, due to our active offensive, and on the other hand, because there was no battle or no active battle in three-quarters of the area, and the one-quarter of the area where we were fighting was precisely an important area for the enemy's strategy and troop transfer, the enemy had no choice but to withdraw troops from other areas and use their main force to deal with us in order to reduce their threat. Therefore, Japanese troops from Yicheng, Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places moved in large numbers towards Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Wuhu. (To be continued)

The Circumstances of Xiang Ying's Speech: Madam Song Meiling, wife of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, recently wrote an article titled "Seven Famous Chronic Diseases." She said: These seven chronic diseases are factionalism, lack of self-control, evading responsibility, self-abandonment, almost, jealousy, narrow-mindedness, etc. She concludes by saying, "I wish that all 450 million compatriots of our nation would issue a resolute call of 'I will be reborn,' and use this voice to evolve into power, awaken action, and create the resurgence of our Chinese nation."

Tao Xingzhi recently wrote a song called "Assimilation of Literary and Military": "Literary people become militarized, military people become cultured, those who are neither literary nor military become literary and military. Literary people no longer scold each other, military people no longer fight. Unite together to create a new world."

Zeng Zhongming was assassinated in Hanoi at 3:00 AM on March 21st and died at 4:30 PM that afternoon. An obituary has already been issued in the Hong Kong newspapers, with the names "Wife Fang Junbi, friends Wang Zhaoming and Chen Bijun" listed behind the obituary notice.

Due to transportation issues in Chongqing, prices have risen considerably, especially for imported goods. Cigarette prices: Small Great Britain, Old Knife Brand, Platinum Dragon, 1.2 yuan per tin; Qianmen Brand 1.5 yuan; Big Cannon Platform 3.4 yuan; Small Cannon Platform 2.1 yuan. Rice is cheaper than in Shanghai, costing 9.8 yuan per picul. The Military Affairs Commission, in order to strictly prevent bad people, has ordered all agencies that employees cannot use official envelopes for private letters. Economic expert Ma Yinchu recently published an article titled "China's Silver Policy and Gold Policy," arguing that the government's promulgated measures to supervise the exchange of gold by jewelers are neither adopting an absolute national gold system nor following the old system of free buying and selling of gold, but rather a peaceful control policy suitable for national conditions. However, he believes that the penalty of suspending business for jewelers and gold shops that violate the regulations seems somewhat rigid.

Today is the 30th anniversary of the Huanghuagang Seventy-Two Martyrs. At the same time, the anniversaries of Deng Zhongyuan, Zhu Zhixin, Chen Yingzhi, Liao Zhongkai, Hu Hanmin, Huang Xing, and other martyrs are commemorated together. Schools at all levels will be closed for one day as usual, with flags at half-mast to express grief. In accordance with the school calendar prescribed by the Ministry of Education, schools at all levels in this city will begin their spring break for one week from April 1st, with classes resuming on April 8th.

(Jinhua News) The Siku Quanshu Collection in Wenlan Pavilion, West Lake, Hangzhou: Since the outbreak of the war, Hangzhou has also fallen. In order to preserve cultural relics, the Zhejiang provincial authorities transported the collection to eastern Zhejiang early on. Recently, it has been transported from eastern Zhejiang to Sichuan for preservation to ensure its safety. The collection was initially stored in the Wenlan Pavilion on Gushan Island in West Lake, to the left of the Qianlong Imperial Palace. The tall buildings and magnificent pavilions were extremely impressive, with three large rooms divided into three floors, and the entire collection was arranged according to its categories. After the 1911 Revolution, the Imperial Palace was converted into Zhongshan Park, and the entire collection was moved to the Da Fangbo Library in the city. Before long, the new building of the Gushan Library was completed, and it was moved in again. Later, the Zhejiang Provincial Library was established, and it was placed in that library. When the War of Resistance began and alarm bells were frequently heard, the authorities, because Japanese aircraft were accustomed to destroying cultural institutions, sent personnel to first transport the collection to Lanxi in eastern Zhejiang for temporary storage. This year, various classic books have been successively moved west. The Ministry of Education, in order to preserve this last remaining achievement, ordered Chen Shuliang, the director of the library, to be responsible for transporting it safely to a certain place in Sichuan for storage. It has now safely arrived at its destination and is being properly guarded and stored by personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Education.

Of the thirteen Christian universities nationwide, four are currently in Shanghai, three in Sichuan, one in Guangxi, one in Hong Kong, two in Fujian, one in Shandong, and one in Beiping. The student numbers for these thirteen schools in the past three years are as follows. From the above description, it is clear that there are only thirty-five students who are average or above, while there are sixty-five students who are below average. When we laymen talk about education, we want to find a word to help it. How can we help it? Only our leaders can see it early. They have specially emphasized the word "management" outside of the word "education," which is often said in colloquial language. I have a way to deal with the sixty-five students who are below average, and I will definitely make them do it and not allow them not to do it. The effort of "speaking above" may sometimes be wasted a little on the "education" aspect, but it is best to save a little effort. What is the effort of "speaking above" in the "management" aspect? That is, for the education aspect, we must say "it must be done, and we must explain why it must be done." This is when there is no alternative but to teach all one hundred people. What is meant by wasting effort? It means that when it comes to explaining that it must be done and why it must be done, there are definitely thirty-five people below average who have no hope of being able to follow automatically. However, it is best to teach them all together. There is no way to clearly recognize the thirty-five people who are above average, and there is even no way to immediately recognize the thirty people below average who can be guided. Therefore, it is best to put a little effort into all one hundred people and speak to them more forcefully, hoping that the thirty-five people above average will all understand and come to manage people together. We also hope that the thirty people below average can believe and follow suit, becoming good people. If there are sixty-five good people and the thirty-five bad people are managed, it will become a good world. If the management and education are not effective and the education lags behind, only thirty-five good people are left, unable to manage the sixty-five bad people. The good people become helpless and can only care for themselves. The world will become a mess. This phenomenon is because there are too few people and everyone is out of control. To reverse this situation, it seems that it does not require thirty-five good people to get up and work hard and take on the "speaking above" education, but initially requires thirty-five good people to work twice as hard and take on the management, which is the smart way.

I think implementing education is not much different from implementing politics. The ancients said that in turbulent times, severe laws should be used. This means that it is not only necessary to manage, but also to manage very strictly. As the saying goes, "Filial sons come from the rod, rebellious sons come from the chopsticks," which also has some reason. Guiding them with politics and regulating them with punishment, although the people avoid it and have no sense of shame, rewards and punishments are also an unavoidable way. Those who implement politics must encourage themselves to further guide them with virtue and regulate them with etiquette. However, when there is no principle above and no law below, even Zhuge Liang has to suffer a little and personally inflict punishments. And when political punishment is important, I would go to read the Classic of Filial Piety to the Yellow Turban bandits. I am reminded of a small family matter. I have a friend named Fan Suxing. His father was a Confucian scholar, so Mr. Fan was deeply rooted, spoke uprightly, and acted according to the rules, and his friends all respected him. His wife, however, was the daughter of a prefect and was not considered particularly bad, but just average. However, as a prefect's daughter, she was used to seeing discord between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law and was not very filial. When Mr. Fan spoke, he used a lot of great principles, which most average women did not understand. So every time the daughter-in-law and mother-in-law quarreled, when he couldn't help it, he would kneel in front of his father's memorial tablet, take off his leather shoes, and slap himself in the face. This was considered guiding with virtue to the fullest extent. But every time this happened, his wife would laugh and say to the maids, "Look, here comes that act again." Mr. Fan died of anger at the age of thirty, probably because he couldn't manage it reasonably, and his emotional influence failed as well. Another example is the recent thrift campaign. In fact, our highest leader has been serving Western food for guests for more than ten years, with only four dishes of Chinese hot pot without wine or cigarettes, and four small bowls of side dishes. Another leader, when he had to hold a banquet, would use a one-pot dish instead. This can be considered a very authentic way of guiding with virtue. However, there are gatherings for meals everywhere, with wine and meat in a mess and the table full of dishes. I don't know if it is considered extravagant or respectful. The regulations specify eight yuan per table, but secretly it costs sixteen or twenty yuan. This example of teaching by example ultimately has little effect in a time when everyone is out of control. It seems that we must start managing impolitely. Since they are leading by example, they cannot complain even if they are restricted.

Therefore, educators desperately try to make their theories very advanced, but forget to manage well. It is no different from an official just posting slogan-style announcements, but the police are not strong enough. I am afraid that they will not be able to achieve non-action governance in the end. And there are sixty-five bad people in the world. It is like playing the lute to a cow when you talk to people below average. Confucius was fooled, so he asserted that it was impossible. Confucius even taught Yan Yuan, an outstanding figure, but it was only "broaden me with literature and regulate me with etiquette," and he still had to "guide me step by step," which is managing invisibly. Therefore, Zigon also said, "The Master's articles can be heard, but the Master's words on human nature and the Way of Heaven cannot be heard." If you desperately want to be a reformed Confucius and force human nature and the Way of Heaven into the brains of people below average, they will actually see it as just a set. It is not only a waste of effort, but also a danger. If you don't believe me, listen to me slowly as I continue to offer my opinions below. (To be continued)

Increased by 35 Percent

Since the fall of Guangzhou, the number of young students in Hong Kong has increased dramatically. Therefore, the number of newly established schools has also increased by more than 35 percent compared to before. The number of young students who have recently arrived in Hong Kong has reached over 50,000.

The Cadar Road Global Student Association declared that the academic year at universities in various countries begins mostly in mid-October and early November in Europe, and mostly in mid-September and early October in the Americas. Although the time of going abroad depends on individual circumstances, it is generally advisable in July and August. The procedures to be completed before going abroad, such as applying for a study abroad certificate, passport, and reserving a seat on the ship, must be prepared early. Those studying in the United States must first obtain an admission permit from the United States before proceeding with other procedures. Because the processing of this certificate takes time, it is essential to start the application three or four months before going abroad. Anyone who aspires to study abroad and wants to know all the details can write to the association for inquiries and will receive a satisfactory reply. It is also reported that the association has a very detailed investigation of the contents of famous universities in various countries and has compiled a list of famous universities and excellent subjects in various countries for students going abroad to use as a reference when choosing a school.

### Humiliating National Loss and Land Enrages Public Sentiment; Cabinet Resigns En Masse; Varnelis Forms New Cabinet; Army Commander Broadcasts Speech Pledging Inevitable Responsibility to Defend the Homeland

(Kovno) As a result of Germany's occupation of Memel, a political crisis has occurred within the Lithuanian government, leading to the resignation of the Mironas cabinet yesterday. President Smetona has immediately appointed Chief of Staff Varnelis to attempt to form a new cabinet. (United Press dispatch, 28th)

(Kaunas) The new Lithuanian cabinet was formed today. The Prime Minister is Major General Černius, the Deputy Prime Minister is Bizausskas, the Foreign Minister is Ubšys, the Interior Minister is Major General Skucas, the Justice Minister is Damasaitis, and the Finance Minister is Sutkus (listed as a retired general), the Education Minister is Bistras, the Agriculture Minister is Krikščiūnas, the Communications Minister is Germanas, and the Defense Minister is Musteikis. From the perspective of the above organization, it can be seen that the new cabinet is a mixed cabinet. In light of the severity of the current situation, the opposition party and the ruling party have resolutely shouldered the heavy responsibility together. For example, Deputy Prime Minister Bizausskas, Education Minister Bistras, and Agriculture Minister Krikščiūnas are all well-known figures in the opposition party. (Reuter dispatch, 28th)

(Kaunas) Lithuanian Army Chief of Staff Nastikas delivered a speech here last night, revealing the reasons for the Lithuanian government's collective resignation. Nastikas declared that the Mironas cabinet, which had been in power for thirteen years, had been subjected to a joint attack by some members of the government, officers of the military, and supporters of former Prime Minister Voldemaras in October of last year, demanding the resignation of the cabinet and the reorganization of parliament. After the decision to return Memel to Germany, the need for the nation to concentrate various political forces to cope with the new situation became even more urgent. Therefore, the resignation of the cabinet was almost a natural consequence of the loss of Memel. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)

(Kaunas) The Mironas cabinet resigned en masse yesterday. Stimulated by the current situation, the people of the whole country have launched demonstration movements for days, promoting patriotic spirit. Various newspapers have reprinted the appeal to the people by the Army Volunteer Association, earnestly requesting the people of the country to unite as one and form a patriotic front, holding weapons to defend the country's freedom. Army Commander General Raštikis delivered a broadcast speech yesterday afternoon, roughly stating that there are four essential elements for maintaining national security: (1) pursuing a realistic foreign policy; (2) maintaining domestic order; (3) resisting foreign forces culturally, spiritually, and economically; and (4) training a strong army. "We will never easily give up the independent sovereignty enjoyed by our country without a struggle," he said. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### Romanian Prime Minister Expresses Determination to Defend Territory; Reports to National Defense Council on Handling of Contingencies

(Bucharest) Prime Minister and Defense Minister Călinescu addressed the Supreme Committee of the National Defense Front today, mentioning the defense actions taken by the Romanian government in the recent crisis, saying that Romania is determined to defend its territory. The recent trade negotiations between Romania and Germany did not involve the issue of independence. If it does, we will certainly not proceed. Germany had requested Romania to attack Ruthenia last fall but was rejected. Recently, when the Romanian government ordered mobilization, it notified the great powers, declaring Romania's decision to defend its territory. Therefore, several grades of new recruits were specially mobilized into the army. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, Foreign Minister Gafencu rose to speak, saying that Romania's relations with Poland and the Balkan Entente have recently been strengthened. Gafencu especially cited the guarantee of Turkey received during the crisis, as being credible. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)

### Heavy Rain on Slovak-Hungarian Border; Military Operations Halted

Heavy rain is pouring in the area on the border between the Slovakian capital, Bratislava, and Hungary, and military operations have been halted. However, the government of the Slovak state is still actively mobilizing its air force and air defense forces, and has published notices in various newspapers, calling up specialist reservists. Regarding the boundary demarcation issue, after the Slovak representative delegation arrived in the capital of Hungary, it notified the Hungarian authorities that if the country's troops do not withdraw completely, the Slovak state will be unable to conduct negotiations. The chief representative of the delegation also telegraphed the state's Foreign Minister Černák, stating that the following three requests would be made: (1) demarcating the boundary line; (2) demanding compensation for damages; (3) determining responsibility for the incident. (Havas dispatch, 28th)

### Japanese National Killed in Yangshupu District; Deceased Kino Worked in a Textile Factory; Japanese Side Immediately Imposes Martial Law and Detains Several People

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reports that Kino, a 36-year-old Japanese national and deputy director of the Chinese personnel section of the No. 3 Factory of the Shanghai Textile Company, was riding in a rickshaw along Linqing Road at 7:40 this morning when he was shot near Hangzhou Road. The bullet pierced his head, and he was critically wounded. The assailant immediately fled. The Japanese military police immediately carried the wounded man to the headquarters on Huacheng Road, and then transferred him to the affiliated hospital of a certain yarn factory, where he

died immediately.

After the shooting, traffic was immediately halted. The Japanese authorities stopped all vehicles coming and going in Yangshupu, inspecting them, so all roads were extremely congested. This ended at about 9:30. As a result of the incident, the Japanese authorities immediately ordered martial law to be implemented north of the Suzhou Creek. Japanese marines and military police set up a cordon at the shooting location. Rickshaw pullers and several Chinese people nearby were

detained for interrogation.

The Public Concession Police Department is assisting the Japanese military police in investigating this case. Their only clue is a single shell casing. According to the news agency, at around 6:00 a.m. yesterday morning, Japanese marines suddenly deployed sentries and searched houses along Yangshupu Road and Linqing Road, waking up the residents. However, after the search,

nothing was found.

It has been learned that Makino, the Japanese director of the personnel section of the No. 2 Factory of the Shanghai Textile Company, was walking with a woman to the intersection of Linqing Road and Zhoujiazui Road yesterday morning when several gunshots suddenly rang out. Makino was shot three times and fell to the ground and died; the woman was not injured. After receiving the report, the Japanese authorities sent a large contingent of Japanese soldiers to conduct a major search.

### Fierce Anti-Foreign Movement Begins in Nanjing; Opposition to Britain Is Particularly Blatant; Clearly Under the Direction of the Japanese Military

*The Continental Times* reports that the Nanjing "Reformed Government," apparently instigated by the Japanese military, has recently begun a fierce anti-foreign movement, the main target of which is direct opposition to Britain. Puppets under Japanese control are using various slogans, large posters, newspaper articles, and editorials to engage in a movement against third countries in the Far East. This information was reported to the reporter by a reliable foreign source who is not allowed to be named. It is said that Nanjing recently held an "Army Day" and publicly invited Chinese civilians to join this movement, forcing shopkeepers to purchase

anti-foreign posters.

Police officers are forcing rickshaws and all vehicles to put up slogans, and during the "New Order Week" parade, leaflets denouncing third countries are widely distributed. People in Nanjing are forced to join the parade, and participants are given three sheng of rice, or even cash, to reward their "loyalty." However, those who participate in the parade are mostly beggars and local ruffians. According to equally reliable foreign sources, similar anti-foreign parades have also been held in other county towns along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway for the past ten days. Newspaper criticism and the text published on the front page are directly

opposed to Britain.

"White imperialism" is being denounced by all. After publishing a fierce anti-British editorial, the Nanjing official publication *Xin Bao* (transliteration) reprinted the following slogans in bold type: (1) Tear down the British flag; (2) Boycott British goods; (3) Confiscate British property in China; (4) Take back all British concessions; (5) Expel British people from the country; (6) Vow not to cooperate with the British. Prior to this, newspapers had also written articles requesting Chinese people employed in British businesses and British consulates to resign, and published detailed plans

for providing subsistence allowances if they lost their jobs as a result of resigning.

When the Japanese spokesman received reporters last night, he replied to questions about anti-British propaganda in Nanjing newspapers, saying that he had not heard of this before. When a reporter asked if the spokesman would investigate the matter and take appropriate action, the spokesman replied, "Yes, but the investigation will take some time." It is also heard that the sale of narcotics in Nanjing is still rampant. Currently, heroin seems to be less available, but opium is even more abundant than before. After Dr. Fisk exposed the narcotics situation last autumn, the Japanese have mostly removed public narcotics advertisements, and newspapers no longer carry advertisements. However, although there is less publicity now, the

trade continues

. Narcotics agencies now use only a simple sign saying "Earth Shop," and there is a very large amount of unregistered narcotics trade that avoids paying some taxes. The Samsung Company at No. 49 Taiping Road and two other earth shops are the most prominent in this business. It is also heard that every day from fifteen to one hundred and fifty wounded or sick Japanese soldiers are transported from the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway to Shanghai. Some of them were wounded in battles with guerrillas, and some were wounded in battles upstream of the Yangtze River, while others were suffering from ordinary illnesses. After each major battle upstream of the Yangtze River, the number of wounded soldiers is particularly high. The Chinese guerrillas closest to Nanjing are about thirty miles away. They and the Japanese army do not pay much attention to each other.

### New Commander of French Troops Officially Takes Office; Scheduled to Meet French Defense Forces This Morning; Paid a Visit to the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Yesterday

*The Continental Times* reports that the French troops stationed in Shanghai are scheduled to hold exercises in Gujiazhai Park tomorrow morning (29th). Colonel Granié, who arrived in Shanghai last Tuesday to replace Colonel Berthelot as the commander of the French troops stationed in Shanghai, will officially accept the command at that time. Colonel Berthelot will go to Japan the next day for a two-week break and is scheduled to return to Shanghai on April 24, and set sail for France by ship the next day.

Colonel Poteau and Colonel Granié of the French military formally paid a visit to the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council this morning (28th), and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps dispatched righteous soldiers to pay their respects.

### Japanese Military Bombs Church Property; Sophistry and Justifications

The French-language *Journal de Shanghai* reported on the 28th that at a Japanese military press briefing last night, an American foreign reporter pressed the Japanese military spokesman hard, asking whether the repeated bombing of church property in various places by Japanese military aircraft was intentional. The reporter also asked if, according to general speculation, the destruction of foreign property by the Japanese military was in fact intentional, with the aim of gradually forcing foreign forces to withdraw from China by this means. At that time, the Japanese military spokesman, hearing this question, looked very displeased and strongly claimed that this kind of speculation had no basis whatsoever and was purely intended to undermine the relationship between the Japanese military and foreigners. The spokesman also claimed that the Japanese military's expulsion of foreign forces from China was in fact mostly due to misunderstandings. Finally, the spokesman said that Qingdao has recently been opened, allowing foreigners to do business, which shows that the Japanese military has no intention of excluding foreigners from "legitimate business" in China.

### French Municipal Council to Award Medals to Senior Personnel of the Shanghai Municipal Council; Gold Medals to Be Awarded to the Director-General and the Commissioner of Police; In Gratitude for Their Cooperation with the French Concession

The remaining enemy soldiers are currently being tracked down and pursued.

Japanese Troops Retreat from Minhang

The Minhang Japanese military Mizuno Guard suddenly retreated entirely last night (27th) and were transferred to Punan to reinforce Nanqiao. The reason is that Xiaotang has been gradually advanced since being recovered by the guerrilla forces. There were only dozens of Japanese troops stationed there, so the Mizuno Guard was transferred to provide reinforcement.

Japanese Military Vehicle Intercepted

At about 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, eighteen Japanese soldiers, traveling in two trucks loaded with military supplies, were traveling north from Minhang Town when they were suddenly intercepted by regular troops near the Fifth Bridge west of Qianliang Temple on the Shanghai-Minhang Road. The regular troops jumped out from the roadside and opened fire. The Japanese soldiers were caught off guard and two of them were killed on the spot and fell on the truck. Afterwards, the driver stepped on the gas and sped north to escape.

### Men's Positions in Japanese Industrial Organizations Mostly Replaced by Women; The Number of Men Transferred to the Front Lines in China Has Increased Sharply; Geisha Businesses are Flourishing Unprecedentedly; Domestic Pacifists Oppose War

*The Continental Times* reports that Mrs. Moore, an employee of the Japanese English *Kochi News*, who will travel throughout Central China, North China, and the Three Northeastern Provinces, arrived here a few days ago. Yesterday (27th), she told reporters about the wartime situation in Japan, saying that the number of Japanese men going to the front lines in China has increased sharply, so men's positions in Japanese industrial organizations are now being replaced by women. Male ticket collectors on Tokyo buses have all been drafted into the army, and their positions are now filled by women. In many factories, women are doing heavy work that was previously done by men. The prosperity of geisha businesses in Japan is unprecedented. There are now thousands more geishas than before. The standard of living in Japan is higher than in China. The Japanese are a war-loving people, but there are still pacifists in the country who oppose war. The Japanese generally have a limited understanding of the situation in China, as all newspapers are subject to strict censorship. Everything is subject to control, according to Mrs. Moore, who has lived in Japan for two wars. She will stay in Shanghai for several days and then travel to the Three Northeastern Provinces via Dalian, returning to work in about six weeks.

### Developing Overseas Trade; Government Encourages Production; Important Local Products Gathered in Hong Kong for Large-Scale Export; Executive Yuan Will Convene a National Production Conference

The Executive Yuan will convene a National Production Conference, striving to make all production enterprises in the country more and more prosperous, so as to enhance the strength of the War of Resistance and National Construction. Management offices have been established in various provinces to be responsible for production matters. Important local products are all concentrated in Hong Kong by the Export and Trade Committee for export. The details are as follows:

Tung Oil Tung oil is one of China's special products, and is a necessary product for the paint industry. Recently, our country's loan to the United States uses tung oil as the main guarantee. Production areas such as Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Yunnan, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Sichuan, etc., have been working hard to produce. Last year, the output value was 39.237 million yuan in national currency. From January to February this year, the output value was 3.484 million yuan in national currency, of which the value of exports to Hong Kong for transshipment was 33.96 million yuan in national currency.

Tea Tea is mostly produced in Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Zhejiang. During the War of Resistance, after the authorities actively developed it, last year's exports not only did not decrease due to the war, but actually increased by 2.26 million yuan. The Japanese dream of destroying our tea production areas and trying to occupy overseas sales fields has been shattered without a trace. This year, our foreign trade has been actively developed, and management offices have been established in various provinces to increase production. From January to February this year, exports were valued at 1.167 million yuan in national currency.

Mineral Sands Mineral sand production areas are concentrated at the junction of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Hunan provinces. Although the flames of war swept across the country last year, under active development, the output did not decrease due to the war, and the export volume did not decrease due to transportation difficulties. Last year's exports were valued at 10.2452 million yuan in national currency, an increase of 5.571 million yuan compared with the previous year. From January to February this year, exports were valued at 14.157 million yuan in national currency.

Medicinal Materials In addition to domestic sales, medicinal materials are shipped to the places where overseas Chinese live every year, such as Malaysia, Annam, Siam, the Americas, etc., in large quantities, and are all exported from Hong Kong. Sichuan produces the most. Last year's exports were valued at 11.443 million yuan in national currency, a decrease of 405,000 yuan compared with the previous year. From January to March this year, exports were valued at 1.83 million yuan in national currency.

Raw Silk The silk production areas are Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, as well as Guangdong, Shandong, and Sichuan. After the war, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangdong, and other provinces were occupied. In the areas that have not been lost, the authorities actively encourage farmers to increase production, and guide farmers in breeding silkworms and reeling silk in several inland provinces. Currently, sericulture management offices have been established in Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Fujian, and other provinces to specifically handle sericulture matters. From January to February this year, exports were valued at 10.565 million yuan in national currency.

Egg Products The export of egg products flourished during World War I, including dry and wet egg white, egg yolk, fresh eggs, frozen eggs, etc. Their uses are either for food or as industrial raw materials. The export season is mostly in spring, as the climate is more suitable. Last year's exports were valued at 48.96 million yuan in national currency. From January to February this year, exports were valued at 7.022 million yuan in national currency.

Animal Casings The export of animal casings is a matter of the past 20 years or so. During the European War, all countries felt a shortage of food and sought to supplement it from other countries. Chinese animal casings also began to be exported at this time to supply various countries. The export ports are concentrated in Shanghai and Tianjin. The intestine industry was greatly affected by the outbreak of the war. Foreign firms took the opportunity to set up factories and manufacture them themselves, but due to the difficulty in obtaining raw materials, they did not achieve much. From January to February this year, exports were valued at 1.97 million yuan in national currency.

Cotton Cotton has always been concentrated in the three major commercial ports of Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin. Most of it was sold to Japan and its territories. In addition to industrial raw materials, smokeless gunpowder and other products also used cotton as raw materials. After the Japanese puppets gained control in North and Central China, a large amount of cotton was exported to Japan. Last year, it was valued at 89.897 million yuan in national currency. From January to February this year, it was valued at 2.926 million yuan in national currency.

Pig Bristles Pig bristles are the basic raw material for making brushes, and are divided into black and white. Sichuan and Hunan provinces are the main production areas. Initially, British and Japanese merchants operated the exports, and later some Chinese also operated them. Most of them are sold to the United States, accounting for half of the export value, followed by Britain, etc. However, very few are exported to Japan. From January to February this year, exports were valued at 4.7 million yuan in national currency, an increase of 1.8 million yuan compared with the same period last year.

### Public Concession Police Raid Hotels Again Yesterday; All Floors of the Zhongnan Hotel Searched; Travelers Questioned in Detail About Their Backgrounds

In the past week, the police authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession have been conducting exceptionally thorough search operations within their territories, day and night, taking shifts to go out on patrol. Anyone even slightly suspected is subject to investigation. As a result, petty thieves have disappeared, and theft cases have been solved repeatedly. They are paying even closer attention to the border areas and public places. At around 8:30 PM last night, the Public Concession reserve team and search team police, under a temporary emergency assembly order, joined with the White Russian squad of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps and set off together to the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII for another search. Even the search personnel did not initially know where they were going. After the police vehicles arrived at their destination, police officers directed the Volunteer Corps to take charge of security. All the police reserve teams were immediately divided into several small teams and began to thoroughly search the hotel's various floors and guest rooms. Travelers were also questioned in detail about their backgrounds. They only finished the search and returned to their teams at around 9:30 PM. It is reported that no cases or individuals were found.

### Fire on Guangxi Road Yesterday Morning; Multiple Fatalities; Wind Fuels Fire's Ferocity; Varying Rumors About the Cause of the Fire; Three Male Corpses Already Found

A fire suddenly broke out at the intersection of Guangxi Road and Hankou Road at around 4:40 AM yesterday. At the time, it was not yet dawn, and laborers were all asleep, so they were initially unaware. It was only when nearby patrol officers noticed white smoke coming from the burning building that they discovered it and rushed to knock on doors and shout. However, the fire inside had already spread and was beyond control. Before long, it broke through the roof and spread to neighboring buildings. Zhang Daxin, a

Ningbo Apprentice

at the Shuren Jewelry Store at numbers 6 and 7, was sleeping upstairs. Once startled awake, he saw that the ladder had been burned through and he could not get downstairs. He jumped out of the window, causing a jaw injury and was sent to the hospital for treatment. At this time, neighbors to the left and right were also awakened one after another and fled, grabbing clothes and rushing out the door. Some were rescuing business ledgers, while others were carrying important boxes and cabinets as they ran.

Shouting and Screaming,

it was a scene of utter chaos. Upon receiving the alarm, the Central Fire Brigade immediately ordered all firefighters to mobilize and drive to the scene to extinguish the fire. However, at this moment, the wind was raging, so the fire used the wind to increase its ferocity. All the neighbors to the left and right, such as the Hengchang Department Store at number 272 on Guangxi Road, the Guanghua Electrical and Plumbing Supplies store at numbers 274 to 276, the Yuanchang Hardware Store at number 278, and the Lao Rongtai

Cosmetics Store

at numbers 672 and 674 on Hankou Road, as well as number 676 and part of the Lianyuan Hotel in the alley behind the Shuren Bookstore, were all caught in the flames. The flames soared, and the fire blazed into the sky. Moreover, the goods in the stores on fire were highly flammable, so extinguishing the fire for a long time was ineffective. At the same time, the firefighters learned that men and women were still trapped inside each burning building, so they had to focus on rescuing people, running back and forth, working extremely hard. After about two hours of

Courageous Firefighting,

the fire was gradually extinguished. As a result, all the affected families suffered enormous losses. Most unfortunately, none of the men and women inside the buildings where the fire started were seen escaping and are believed to have perished in the fire. Firefighters then began digging and found one male corpse at the scene. Yesterday morning, they continued to find two more corpses. One was charred beyond recognition, but according to acquaintances, they were all employees of the Lao Rongtai Cosmetics Store. The three corpses have been

Sent to the Morgue

for examination. In addition, it is rumored that there are two more unidentifiable bodies that are currently being investigated. As for the cause of the fire, there are also varying rumors, and the police are conducting separate interviews and a thorough investigation.

### Japanese Shot Chinese Farmers on Hongqiao Road on the 4th; Another Farmer Injured and Taken Away by Car

The English-language "China Press" reported that at around 11:15 AM today (the 28th), four Japanese in plainclothes shot and killed one Chinese farmer and injured another on Hongqiao Road. Foreigners passing by the area saw the deceased's body and the injured person, who was tightly bound on a rickshaw to prevent his escape, lying on the roadside. The four Japanese, dressed in Chinese clothing, were riding bicycles. It was unclear whether they were Japanese soldiers or mercenaries. They were inspecting pedestrians on Hongqiao Road. According to witnesses, the two Chinese were clearly farmers walking along Hongqiao Road. Upon seeing the inspection team, they hesitated and paid attention to these four individuals, who appeared to be Chinese. Unwilling to be inspected or questioned by the Japanese, they turned around to leave. The four Japanese then pulled out handguns and fired at them. One Chinese man fell to the ground and died, while the other was injured but managed to escape. He was then captured and tied up. Thirty minutes later, one of the Japanese summoned a car and took the Chinese man to the Japanese military headquarters, along with the corpse.

### Hosiery Factory Owner Falsely Accused of Theft; Sues for Perjury and False Accusation; Court Rules Defendants Shen Jinzhou, etc. Not Guilty

On the night of January 15 of this year, the Yitaixing Coal Yard on Xinza Road was robbed of 30,000 yuan in legal tender. Later, police detectives, accompanied by Hu Tingxiang and Meng Zhenjia, employees of the coal yard, investigated the gang of thieves on various roads and public places. When they passed the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hardoon Road, Hu and Meng saw that the

Facial Features of a Passenger

on the No. 7 bus closely resembled the thief from the previous night's robbery. They reported this to the detective, who arrested the man. However, upon further investigation, it was learned that the person arrested was named Lin Jiabin, the owner of the Fuhua Hosiery Factory, and had no connection to the robbery. He was immediately released. However, Lin, feeling aggrieved that he had been detained for a week due to the identification by Hu and others,

And Had Suffered Greatly,

hired lawyers Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Lu Qi to file a lawsuit against Shen Jinzhou, the manager of Yitaixing, as well as Hu Tingxiang and Meng Zhenjia, for perjury and false accusation in the First Special District Court. On the other hand, the defendants also hired lawyers Li Guozhen, Yu Ting, and Li Yujun to defend them, arguing that Shen Jinzhou had never participated in the identification process and therefore could not be accused of false accusation. Moreover, Hu and Meng were not intentionally framing him and did not

Voluntarily Report to the Authorities.

According to the precedents set by the Supreme Court in the 3rd year of the Dali Yuan, Shang Zi No. 569, the 20th year, Shang Zi No. 303, and the 22nd year, Zi No. 1818, the charges should not stand, and they requested a declaration of innocence. As for the charge of perjury, the court should not accept a private lawsuit. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shi declared in the First Criminal Court that the perjury portion was not accepted, and in the false accusation portion, Shen Jinzhou, Hu Tingxiang, and Meng Zhenjia were all found not guilty.

It is rumored that a large number of puppet "teachers" from puppet "elementary schools" will continue to be cut next month.

### Record of the Annual Banquet of the Sinology Department of the German Firm Defu Foreign Company

The German firm Defu Foreign Company in this port, the Far East's general distributor of the world-renowned "Indanthren" and other dyes, has an exceptionally thorough understanding of the future of China and Germany, and firmly believes that the Sino-German relationship will only be bright in the future and will rarely encounter obstacles. Therefore, several years ago, it established a Sinology Department within the firm's organizational structure to study Chinese culture and social issues so that it can respond to and contribute to Sino-German relations in the future. It is heard that the department is divided into two units: one is called the Chinese Language Group, and all German staff members of the firm must join this group and study Chinese language and writing. The highest standard is to be able to speak fluent Chinese Mandarin and draft ordinary Chinese documents. The other unit is called the Translation Group, which specializes in collecting important books, periodicals, and newspapers related to China for the firm's authorities to reference. In addition, various materials are collected, translated, and archived. It is heard that the Sinology Department held its annual banquet on the 15th of this month at the Tai Lai Restaurant on the Fourth Horse Road, chaired by Mr. Ledes (Mr. Li is one of the managers of Youfu Foreign Company and concurrently serves as the director of the Sinology Department). Attendees included Mr. Fulaise (Mr. Fu is the supervisor of the Sinology Department) and many other staff members of the firm. During the banquet, many methods for improving the firm were discussed and agreed upon.

### A Visit to the Cheng Teh Pharmaceutical Factory

Cheng Teh Pharmaceutical Factory's pure and mixed Gui Guai Kang Fu Duo liquid, a targeted domestic tonic and cough remedy, has recently undergone a lengthy research and development process, resulting in the invention of sugar-coated Kang Fu Duo tablets, which are convenient to carry and easy to take. As a result, business is booming. Considering that the domestic pharmaceutical industry is still in its infancy, the factory's products not only rival foreign goods but also represent further innovation, demonstrating a commendable spirit of hard work and progress. Our reporter recently took a trip to visit the factory and will briefly describe the production process and facilities below for your information.

Laboratory: Upon arriving at the factory, we were greeted by Mr. Chen Xingwu, the factory manager, and Mr. Zuo Gu'er, a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, who first showed us the laboratory. They explained that for modern medicines to remain effective over time, the raw materials must be properly identified and the ingredients must be combined according to established standards. After production, the ingredients must still be tested to ensure consistent quality and effectiveness. Therefore, the factory pays close attention to the laboratory's facilities, which include reference books, precise analytical instruments, refrigerated storage, ultraviolet lamps, and more. In addition to the three products currently available—Kang Fu Duo tablets, liquid, and infant tablets—the factory is actively engaged in research on several imported specialty drugs. As a result, several chemists in the laboratory are busy at work, in an orderly and well-organized manner.

Preparation Room: In the preparation room, super-strength cod liver oil is being extracted using a small electric heating vacuum distiller. On average, one kilogram of super-strength cod liver oil can be extracted from each kilogram of concentrated cod liver oil. This extract is added to Kang Fu Duo tablets, ensuring that each tablet contains at least 500,000 international units of Vitamin A. Therefore, the medicinal effect of each tablet is comparable to one tablespoon of Kang Fu Duo liquid. Additionally, electric tablet testing machines, electric mixers, filters, and other equipment are fully equipped.

Extraction Room: This room is used for raw material extraction and mixing. Several raw materials in Kang Fu Duo liquid, such as wild cherry bark powder, must be extracted for their active ingredients before they can be used in the formula. The room contains over forty blue vats, which are used to hold the extracted ingredients and to mix the raw materials. After the extracted ingredients are prepared, they are combined with nourishing ingredients such as malt extract, calcium, iron, potassium, manganese, and quinine. After careful mixing and blending, the mixture is poured into a transport funnel and flows into a centrifugal clarifier in the mechanized workshop for clarification.

Mechanized Workshop: The centrifugal clarifier in this room is designed based on the principle of centrifugal force in physics. Its storage device can completely remove even the finest impurities from Kang Fu Duo. As a result, the Kang Fu Duo liquid is exceptionally pure and does not produce sediment even after long storage. After being clarified, the Kang Fu Duo is poured into an electric automatic conveyor, which lifts it to the packaging room on the second floor for further packaging. The structure of this conveyor is extremely ingenious. When the appropriate volume of Kang Fu Duo has entered, the motor pump automatically starts and lifts the liquid upward. Once the lifting is complete, the motor pump automatically shuts off. Using this machine not only reduces labor but also reduces the liquid's contact with air, ensuring its cleanliness, as the transport pipes are directly connected to the bottling process. There is also a large vacuum distiller, the principle and use of which are completely the same as the small electric heating vacuum distiller in the preparation room. The difference is that one uses regular heat while the other uses steam heat. This large distiller has a large capacity and produces a large quantity, making it suitable for extracting ordinary cod liver oil. The dual-purpose fire and steam heated distilled water machine is used to produce distilled water for preparing Kang Fu Duo.

Tablet Production Workshop: This factory is dedicated to the production of Kang Fu Duo tablets. Inside, there are double-ball powder mills, mixers, sand granulators, ambient temperature electric heating dryers, tablet making machines, sugar coating machines, polishing machines, and more, arranged in an orderly fashion. Not only are the designs aesthetically pleasing, but the production efficiency of each machine is also substantial. All of these designs are the result of the factory's authorities' ten years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry and countless research and improvements, enabling them to achieve this level of perfection. The success of Kang Fu Duo tablet production is due to the prior invention of extracting super-strength cod liver oil from cod liver oil. This super-strength cod liver oil is used as the main ingredient, combined with the existing ingredients in Kang Fu Duo liquid, such as manganese, iron, calcium, potassium, quinine, and guaiacol, which are mixed with a mixer. Raw materials with coarser textures must first be ground to the desired fineness using a double-ball powder mill before mixing to ensure complete and even blending. Distilled water is then added, and the mixture is granulated with a sand granulator, dried in an ambient temperature electric heating drying cabinet at a temperature not exceeding 60 degrees Celsius, and then formed into tablets by a tablet making machine. Subsequently, the tablets are coated with chocolate sugar in a sugar coating machine and finally polished in a polishing machine, completing the production of the tablets. Upon close inspection, the tablets are not only smooth and uniform but also brightly colored and eye-catching. Chocolate-colored sugar coating is particularly difficult to produce. Without sufficient research and experience, the color will easily become dull, and it will be difficult to achieve uniform coverage. The factory's products have reached a level of perfection, and their spirit of painstaking research is truly admirable.

Packaging Room Walls: Three Kang Fu Duo storage tanks are installed above, receiving the liquid medicine lifted by the automatic conveyor from the mechanized workshop. Each tank has hoses for bottling. The remaining packaging steps, such as installing wooden stoppers, tightening screws, steaming, sealing, applying tin bottle caps, gluing, attaching product inserts, and wrapping the outer layer of printed paper, are then completed. The aforementioned tin bottle caps are custom-made by a German manufacturer, preventing theft, leaks, and counterfeiting, while also appearing neat and beautiful, and making it easier for distributors in various ports to identify the product. This is truly a multi-beneficial approach.

Boiler Room: Two 30-pound steam pressure boilers are placed on the left and right, which can be used as needed, allowing for flexibility in daily work and avoiding unnecessary waste.

Overall, the factory's facilities are as described above. The various machines installed are not only exquisitely crafted but also entirely designed and manufactured by domestic machine factories, which is particularly commendable and valuable. Furthermore, the site utilization is well-arranged, systematic, and orderly, suitable for application, convenient for management, and exceptionally clean. Recently, we learned that in addition to producing Kang Fu Duo liquid and tablets, the factory is also working hard on the invention of several new specialty drugs, which should be available to the public soon.

Science and Life

### The Rootless Flower

— Jing Qing

China has been accepting Western culture for seventy or eighty years, so why is China's scientific progress so slow? The reason is that the Chinese people do not have a sufficient understanding of science. They think that moving some machines from the West and copying some old methods is science. Aviation needs to be developed, but there is no need to focus on the most theoretical fluid mechanics. Radio needs to be promoted, but there is no need to bury oneself in the study of electromagnetic waves. The Chinese people only know how to enjoy Western material civilization but do not seek the Western scientific spirit. Therefore, training the navy, building guns and cannons, developing mining, and operating shipping have been going on for decades, but Chinese science remains immature. It must be known that science must be approached from the root. One should understand the natural mysteries of science, fully acquire scientific knowledge, and then apply it to practical aspects in order to promote and develop it and achieve great success. If one only moves things from the East and copies things from the West, enjoying some ready-made things, it is like picking a rootless flower and bringing it to China. It can only be used for decoration and cannot make it flourish. What benefit is this to China's science?

### Human Heredity and Marriage

— Xing Qiu

As the saying goes, "Plant melons and get melons, plant beans and get beans," which aptly reveals the mystery of biological inheritance. Ever since Mendel used tall and short pea plants in the monastery to obtain the law of inheritance, this research has attracted the attention of the scientific community. Using fruit flies and plants, it was finally determined that the inheritance of all organisms is controlled by hereditary factors. In modern times, eugenics has emerged to improve the human race. So-called strong nations must first start with improving the human race, and future progress will be considerable.

It is now confirmed that hereditary material is entirely carried by sex cells. Someone once joked that the world's human population is about 1.5 billion, of which sperm only accounts for one drop. This drop of hereditary material creates humans with so many characteristics, which is truly a strange thing. Scientifically, the actual process of fertilization in animals was not fully discovered until the second half of the nineteenth century. An important matter in human heredity is the investigation of the Kallikak family. He married an excellent woman and an inferior woman, one after the other, and the countless descendants produced were simply incomparable between the two branches. Second, Galton established the law of ancestral inheritance, which states that the closer the ancestors, the greater the impact on the descendants. Therefore, the investigation of inheritance became very popular. A few years ago, Mr. Pan Guangdan also conducted research on the genealogy of Mei Lanfang, stating that the achievements of famous actors are at least related to inheritance (published in the Tsinghua Journal). Inheritance is indeed one of the two major factors creating life, along with the environment.

Human inheritance can be divided into two aspects according to existing research results, but it is often not completely obvious when encountering special circumstances. In terms of physical constitution, such as edema, diabetes insipidus, color blindness, jaundice, resistance to goiter, shortened lifespan, blood type, hemorrhoids, cryptorchidism, hernia, epilepsy, and diabetes, there is genetic confirmation. However, except for color blindness, which has been clearly proven to have a higher chance of inheritance for women, the inheritance forms of other various conditions have not yet been fully understood. However, the possibility of inheritance has been proven undoubtedly.

Secondly, in terms of spiritual inheritance, this is similar to Galton's ancestral inheritance theory and is very obvious in terms of intelligence. In terms of so-called innate endowment, the inheritance of conditions such as idiocy and mental deficiency is well known to doctors. Conversely, superior intelligence, such as that of scientists, politicians, and writers, is very common in their inheritance. In Darwin's family, from his grandfather onwards, there were sixteen famous scientists in five generations. Is this a coincidence? The popular saying "Dragons beget dragons, phoenixes beget phoenixes" is very reasonable.

There is also research on consanguineous marriage in inheritance. Plant-based studies have shown that due to inbreeding, there are often adverse results in subsequent generations. In China, it has been believed since ancient times that children born from consanguineous marriages are mostly physically weak, mentally deficient, and have declining reproductive capacity. According to a survey of 830 consanguineous marriages by Bemiss in 1859, about 22% of their descendants were healthy, while 76% were unhealthy, which clearly indicates that consanguineous marriage is not appropriate. However, conversely, if the ancestors are all virtuous, good, and healthy, then consanguineous marriage may produce more outstanding individuals. Therefore, the current conclusion on this issue is that if the lineage has excellent traits, consanguineous marriage can maintain its characteristics in future generations. If there are doubts about inheritance between close relatives, marriage should be avoided to prevent the risk of increasing adverse inheritance. In short, it is better to reduce consanguineous marriage.

The choice of marriage is related to oneself and one's descendants, and also has an impact on the country and the nation. The eugenics and eugenic education that is popular all over the world aims to improve both nature and the environment. Seeds rely on innate heredity, while the day after tomorrow depends on the educational environment. In this wave of national rejuvenation, everyone may be in urgent need of this common sense of human inheritance. The superior should be preserved, and the inferior should be eliminated. At least it has a significant relationship with our family, so how can marriage be a matter without scientific conditions?

### Spiral Helicopter

— Rong Ren

Currently, airplanes require large airfields to maneuver freely, hover, and take off and land. It is still difficult to fly from private residences. This is an obstacle to the widespread use of airplanes, which urgently needs to be solved by inventors. There are now several types of helicopters that take off and land vertically. The most common one is the rotorcraft with a windmill-shaped blade on top of the fuselage. Recently, an inventor in California, USA, designed a completely different type of helicopter.

The wing of the aircraft spirals like a coil spring, encircling a vertical shaft. The wing is filled with gas, and the shaft stands upright on a spherical fuselage. Rudders and stabilizers are mounted on a yoke, which is mounted on the horizontal axis of the spherical fuselage and can move to control the direction of the aircraft. The aircraft has another feature: if the engine is damaged midway, the bottom containing the engine and fuel tank can be detached and fall freely, while the other parts of the aircraft can slowly descend like a parachute.

Although it is expected that the speed of the aircraft cannot compete with current airplanes, it can take off and land in a very small area, which gives it special uses such as transportation between rural areas and cities, military reconnaissance, map making, and maritime rescue. It is especially convenient for private use. The diagram shows the shape of the spiral helicopter. The wing is spiral, winding around the axis and filled with gas. The bottom containing the engine and fuel tank can be detached.

### Observation of Rainfall

— Compiled by

Rainfall or snowfall is a common phenomenon for us, but it has a close relationship with the growth of plants and animals on the ground and the survival of humans. Almost every drop of water on land comes from rain and snow falling from the sky. Without rain and snow, all living things on land would be extinct, and areas with less rain and snow would become deserts, unsuitable for human habitation. In ancient times, nomadic people lived by water and grass, so areas with abundant rainfall were often the birthplace of ethnic groups. When they abandoned nomadism and engaged in farming, timely rain and sunshine were especially beneficial to farmland. As for the rain and snow that fall on the ground, most of them converge into streams, rivers, and lakes and flow into lakes and oceans, and it is difficult to list all the benefits to mankind.

Since rain and snow are so important to mankind, since ancient times, people have believed that rainfall or snowfall is controlled by the creator and have never paid close attention to and researched it. Even in European and American countries, it was not until the last hundred years that people began to advocate it and engage in observation. However, it was soon regarded by the government as one of the important national policies, which was greatly expanded, and huge sums of money were spent every year, which lasted for a long time. The country's scientific kick is immature, and it is inevitable that it lags behind in observing rainfall. However, in the past ten years, it has also been following Europe and the United States, roughly forming a scale. Unfortunately, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the country has been in turmoil, and this matter has not been taken care of.

This article will briefly describe the simple principles of observing rainfall, so as to introduce it to the people of the country. Those who are interested in this matter can engage in it individually, without waiting for the government to promote it before organizing it. Then, after the war is over, they can still maintain a relatively long-term record, which is not a way to contribute to the country.

(1) The observation of rainfall includes all water volume falling on the ground, so snow, sleet, and hail are also included in it, but rainfall accounts for the most part, so it is collectively called it. The instrument for measuring rainfall is called a rain gauge.

(2) There are many types of rain gauges. The one used in our country is shown in the attached figure, which is composed of (1) a rain-collecting funnel, (2) an outer cylinder, and (3) a rain-measuring tube. The diameter of the rain-collecting funnel is eight inches, and the remaining dimensions can be obtained according to the scale in the figure.

(3) Rainfall is measured in millimeters (mm) of water depth falling on the ground, so the collected snow, sleet, and hail should be melted into water first, and then measured. The water depth accumulated in the rain-measuring tube is exactly ten times the rainfall, so find a way to use a wooden strip to measure the number of centimeters of water depth in the tube, which is equivalent to the number of millimeters of rainfall.

(4) The rain gauge must be placed on a flat ground in the room to obtain accurate records. The location should not be placed on the roof or soil that is too high above the ground.

(5) Rainfall should be observed daily at a specified time, preferably at 7 or 8 AM, so that the obtained record can be used as the rainfall for the following day. However, in the event of a heavy rain, it should be measured and recorded in installments, and the start and end times of the rainfall should be recorded.

(6) The data obtained from observing rainfall should be recorded in a table, with the unit of rainfall being one millimeter, and calculated to one decimal place. Any day with rainfall less than 0.1 mm is considered as no rain, which is related to the statistics of rainy days.

### Man-Made Crystal

— Xin Jun

Quartz is a very common mineral, its composition the same as sand and gravel.  When naturally produced and purely transparent, it is called crystal. However, some contain impurities, resulting in non-transparent colors. Transparent crystal has a wide range of uses, and large pieces are highly valued. But now it can be mass-produced. This is due to the proper methods being found after ten years of research. Therefore, not only has important industry been helped, but also scientific research and the arts have progressed. Because sand and gravel (silicon dioxide) account for about three-fifths of the Earth's crust for ten miles, there is no need to worry about a shortage of raw materials. The most important things are of course mechanical equipment and capital, etc.

The most important property of crystal is its transparency to light, allowing it to transmit from infrared rays (heat rays) to extremely short ultraviolet rays. Moreover, its expansion after heating is very small, only 0.0000058 per degree Celsius increase, only one-fourteenth of that of glass, one-seventeenth of platinum, and one-thirty-fourth of copper. A one-meter-long crystal rod, when the temperature rises by a thousand degrees, only expands by six ten-thousandths. With such a long rod, light entering from one end can have 93 percent pass through to the other end.  Whether visible or invisible light, it can pass through the curve of crystal without much loss, meaning it is very transparent.

The glass condenser lenses used in cinemas have a very short lifespan because they are subject to high heat and usually crack within one or two days. If made of crystal, they can be used for seven or eight months. The pendulum inside a clock often expands and contracts due to cold and heat, causing the clock to run inaccurately. If the pendulum is made of crystal, there is no fear of expansion and contraction. When a glass thermometer and a crystal thermometer are placed in ice (0 degrees), and then brought out to a heat of five thousand one hundred and fifty degrees, and then placed back in ice, the glass thermometer will show four degrees below zero.  But the crystal one will still maintain 0 degrees. Large lenses and reflectors in observatories are subject to expansion and contraction due to cold and heat. All those made of glass must be maintained at a constant temperature by various methods in order to obtain accurate results. If crystal is used instead, these procedures can be reduced.

When a quarter-inch thick glass tube is heated until it turns red and then immersed in water, it will crack.  A similar crystal tube heated to 3,200 degrees Fahrenheit (the melting point of platinum) and then immersed in water to cool down will not crack. This is also because the thermal expansion and contraction are very small.

The ultraviolet rays emitted by a crystal mercury lamp can pass through a crystal rod. Therefore, photographs can be taken of recesses in the human body or other places that are not easily accessible, and direct examinations can be carried out.

The method of manufacturing crystal is to use small grains of natural crystal, placed in a stone or carbon crucible, pressed very tightly, so that when the concentration increases and the product needs to burst, each part does not scatter, allowing gas to enter the gaps to form bubbles.  In a vacuum furnace, the crystal is melted at about 18,000 degrees, the faster the better, within three quarters of an hour, and the lower the pressure, the better. The transformed transparent dross, containing some small bubbles, is placed in another graphite crucible, hung vertically in the middle of a carbon tube furnace. A graphite rod is installed to gather in the crucible to form a piston shape, with heavy pressure added on top. After the furnace ash is burned and melted, the bubbles are crushed by the heavy pressure, and at the same time, the crystal is pressed down, forming rods, tubes, or other shapes. If large crystals are to be made, then a vacuum furnace that can withstand high pressure can be used, the crystal placed inside, and after it is melted by heat, the vacuum valve is closed tightly and the pressure is increased. In this way, extremely large crystal blocks are formed, with no bubbles inside, and are better than the best optical glass.

### Mosquitoes Treat Diseases

— Wu Yi

A certain mental hospital in England has recently opened a strange ranch, not raising cattle and sheep and other livestock, but raising mosquitoes, the purpose of which is to transmit malaria to humans. But readers should not think that this ranch is some kind of killer monster training ground in a future germ warfare, it has great benefits for humans, because according to experiments, several kinds of neurological diseases can be treated with malaria, just use mosquitoes as a medium to make the patient suffer from mild malaria.

The mosquitoes raised in this ranch are native to England. After hatching from eggs, they are fed rabbit blood for several days. Then they are placed in glass bottles, and the mouth of the bottle is placed against the leg of someone suffering from malaria. These mosquitoes suck a small amount of blood from his leg, and then become a medium for transmitting malaria germs.

Then use fifteen or twenty of these mosquitoes, place them in another bottle, and put the mouth of the bottle against the skin of a person suffering from a neurological disease. When they bite the skin, they transmit the germs to the neurological patient, and soon this person develops mild malaria. In most cases, this malaria is very effective in treating neurological diseases. The malaria germs used in this hospital are imported from Madagascar and are a relatively harmless type of germ.

### Life-Saving Belt

— Zhen

The life-saving belt is a device that uses chemical action to save people from drowning. It is a new invention of the British Lyf-Boy company. The central part of the belt stores a kind of mixed chemical medicine, which can be transformed into gas, causing that part to swell. When in use, the rescuer fastens the belt around the chest of the person in distress and squeezes the center of the belt forcefully to make it expand, thus obtaining a kind of buoyancy, helping the person in distress float to the surface of the water, making it easier for the rescuer to drag him to the shore. The reason for the expansion is that when squeezing, a dilute acid solution splashes onto a small amount of acidic sodium carbonate, resulting in the generation of expanding gas.

### A Mechanical Fish 　 One-Person Submarine

— Hao Ru

Now many people in the world are paying attention to soaring in the air, and at the same time, some people are working hard to travel in the water. The underwater spectacle is no less than the illusion in the air, and traveling in the water is indeed worthy of our attention.  Connett, a Chicagoan in the United States, recently plans to travel from Chicago to Michigan City in a self-made fish-shaped one-person submarine, traveling underwater for a distance of thirty-seven miles. This fish-shaped one-person submarine has an extremely small body, only eleven feet long, twenty-three inches wide in the chest, and only thirty-seven inches high. It can be called the smallest submarine in the world. Connett has taken this submarine underwater 347 times, reaching a depth of 31 feet and a distance of 14 miles. The submarine relies on two sets of batteries for power, and also has all the equipment of a submarine, such as a respirator, air supply, air pump, and periscope.

Vein Patterns on the Back of the Hand

Vein patterns on the back of the hand, like fingerprints, can also be considered a unique sign of each person. This is a new theory advocated by German Dr. Forck. According to him, the vein patterns on the back of each person's hand are crisscrossed, and the patterns formed are different from each other and have their own characteristics. The vein patterns on the back of the hands of twins are indeed very similar, which is an exception, just like the fingerprints of twins.  All other people have absolutely no identical patterns. The doctor used infrared photography to study this issue and came to this conclusion.

Radio Waves Melt Rivets

The use of radio waves is no longer limited to transportation. At the New York World's Fair this time, the last rivet of the Radio Corporation of America pavilion was melted and driven in by radio waves. The steel rivet was placed in a concentrated radio field in the center of a coil, and heated to white heat by radio waves within one minute, and then passed through the rivet hole to flatten the two ends of the rivet.

### The Meaning of Death

— Mao Lie

Today is the 29th anniversary of the Yellow Flower Mound Seventy-Two Martyrs' sacrifice for righteousness. All the people of the Republic of China, of course, are very much commemorating them. I, in addition to commemorating them, cannot help but reflect on the past and feel the meaning of death.

Jesus said: "Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will save it." Although this sentence originally had a religious meaning, we may as well take it and use it flexibly: the first part can be said to be for those who are generally greedy for life and afraid of death,苟延残喘 (eke out an existence), and the second part can be given to our martyrs, because if it were not for their generous sacrifice, where would we have an independent and autonomous Republic of China to avoid being slaughtered by foreign tribes!

Now, our independence and autonomy are again facing great danger, and Yellow Flower Mound has also been trampled under the iron hooves of the enemy. What should we do today, or from today onwards, to be worthy of our martyrs? How can we ensure that our country will no longer be slaughtered by foreign tribes? Of course, we still need to follow the spirit of our martyrs, make generous sacrifices, and not be afraid of death!

Before the War of Resistance, I always felt that our national spirit was somewhat depressed. When the War of Resistance began, I saw many people with lofty ideals and integrity, for the sake of saving the country, going through fire and water, and not hesitating to die, and I turned to optimism. Now, except for a few people on the isolated islands who are still living in a drunken dream, regardless of rise and fall, everyone else has simply been fully mobilized and is engaged in a great struggle that has never been seen before in ancient times. I can say that everyone has such a change because everyone already knows the meaning of death, that is, everyone already has the spirit of the Seventy-Two Martyrs who are not afraid of death.

Soon after the Seventy-Two Martyrs died, the brand-new Republic of China was established. Now, soon after hundreds of millions of martyrs die, I can also predict that the glorious Republic of China will look down on the world.

Death can be lighter than a feather, or heavier than Mount Tai. To die for the country and the nation is naturally heavier than Mount Tai. If civil officials do not love money and military officers are not afraid of death, the country has hope of being saved. I hope that every citizen, whether civil or military, will make that death heavier than Mount Tai when necessary, so that the victory of the War of Resistance will be realized soon!

It is better to be a lioness who rushes to death than a sheep who is greedy for life. Modern people should have this modern spirit! The martyrs of Yellow Flower Mound are all lions, and only the "pacifist" traitors are sheep. Let us rise up and follow in the footsteps of the martyrs: Die! Die! Die! Seek life from death!

### Grandma Enters the City (Part 1)

— Ming Zhi

Grandma took out a large bucket of rice, and a group of people squatted on the ground, each taking a bowl and eating. But today's situation was a little different. So Grandma said with a smile:

"You used to be always laughing and talking, eating happily, why are you sighing like this today, as if you have something on your mind?"

"Grandma," said a small team leader, Wang Mingyuan, "we do have something on our mind. But you wouldn't understand if we told you."

This group of them had been living in Grandma's house for half a month, so they were all very familiar with each other and there was nothing to be restrained about. Grandma cooked for them, and they were paid the same wages. Grandma's son still worked in the fields as usual, and his wife and grandchildren also lived at home as usual, helping Grandma cook. Grandma often chatted with them, and they also treated Grandma's family as their own, and did not hide anything.

"Tell me about it," Grandma actually urged, "maybe I can figure it out."

"Well," Wang Mingyuan said it.

It turned out that they had received an order from "above" today, asking them to send some equipment and leaflets to a designated place in the city tomorrow. The day after tomorrow, they would attack the city from four directions. Their people had already entered the city and were waiting for the equipment and leaflets to arrive so they could rise up and respond at that time. But in the past few days, the inspection at the city gate had been very strict. Not to mention that they could not bring anything in, even ordinary men would inevitably be in danger when they walked to the city gate. They were uneasy about this matter, so they were not even motivated to eat.

"What's so difficult about this," Grandma still said with a smile, "I'll take care of it for you."

"This won't do!" Wang Mingyuan said.

"This won't do! This won't do!" The other "brothers" also said this.

Grandma's daughter-in-law heard it by the waist door and also said to Grandma from afar, "This won't do!"

"What's so wrong with it!" Grandma stopped smiling and said resolutely.

"I can carry these things and walk these roads."

"It's not like that," Wang Mingyuan quickly took a few bites, finished his meal, and said, "This matter is very dangerous. We can't ask you, such an old grandma, to do it." "That's a joke," Grandma said coldly, "What's the use of being old? I should be doing such dangerous things! Besides, this is for the country: you are fighting regardless of your lives, what am I, an old woman, hiding for! Isn't Grandma Zhao also an old woman!"

This was really somewhat unexpected for the group of people. Grandma actually understood these things and had this determination. But this was not unexpected after all, because in the past half month, the group of people's words, whether intentional or unintentional, Grandma had heard a lot. Even the story of Grandma Zhao, she had heard it very well.

Wang Mingyuan had nothing to say for a while, so he stood up and looked at Grandma. Seeing that she was an old woman in her fifties with very good spirits, who was usually organized in managing her family and decisive in dealing with things, now standing in front of the group of people, with such a confident look, it really made people believe that she could do this.

"Then what do you want to do?" Wang Mingyuan couldn't help but say this.

"Watch my method tomorrow morning."

"Okay, we'll see your method tomorrow." Wang Mingyuan had no choice but to respond this way.

In the evening, Grandma's son came back and knew about this matter. He was very uneasy and advised his mother not to take such a big risk. He should do it himself. Later, he knew that he really couldn't do it, and Grandma was so determined, so he had no choice but to worry, making it difficult for him to sleep all night!

But Grandma slept very soundly at night. She got up before dawn. She used to get up early to prepare tea and breakfast for the group of people. Today, she got up even earlier, first did the daily routine with her daughter-in-law, gave a few instructions, and then walked into the group of people and said to them:

"Take out all your things, I'm going to prepare them."

After she said that, she returned to her room. When she came out again, everyone couldn't help but be surprised. When they looked closely again, they couldn't help but laugh out loud. It turned out that she had completely disguised herself, disguised as an old beggar woman, with rags on her body and disheveled hair on her head, not to mention that, but she had smeared pot ash on her face, and red candle oil and red dye water on her hands and exposed insteps, which looked really like pus flowing, filthy and unbearable. In addition, she was carrying a bamboo stick and a broken basket in her hands, and the basket contained a broken bowl and some rags.

You drew the light of new life.

It lit the torch of national liberation,

Shining brightly in all directions!

Next year on this day, on Yellow Flower Mound,

The national flag of the motherland will fly again.

Our revolutionary martyrs,

We will respectfully offer wine in front of your graves!

### "Monkeys Climbing Trees"

— Ming Tian

There are indeed many things in the world that make people anxious and embarrassed when they see them, but they are helpless. Seeing "monkeys climbing trees, not stopping until they die," I am afraid it is one of these examples.

The spirit of monkeys is admirable. They refuse to rest, they want to climb. If they walk down well, they still want to climb; if they unfortunately fall down, they still want to climb. If they climb to a side branch, they want to climb; if they climb to the top, they still want to climb. Climb and climb again, climb endlessly, climb until they die. Zhuge Liang's "exerting himself to the utmost, until his death" is nothing more than this spirit.

We praise Zhuge Liang, so we also praise monkeys; we praise monkeys, so we also praise people who are like monkeys now, because according to the general rules of arithmetic, people who are like monkeys now are Zhuge Liang.

The most common are gamblers. If they win money, they want to win more, so they still want to gamble; if they lose money, they want to make a comeback, so they want to gamble even more, until they gamble away everything. If they are lucky, they will become tramps, and if they are unlucky, they will commit suicide. The most common are lustful ghosts. They love one when they see one. Today they dance, and tomorrow they go to a brothel. They must lose all their family property and have sores all over their bodies before they stop. There are many other examples that can be cited everywhere, and they are also heard and seen by everyone, so it is not surprising to talk about them.

They all have the spirit of monkeys, so some people say, "This is why this 'Zhuge Liang' is a 'Zhu'!"

But what is strange is that nowadays, transportation is developed and cultures communicate, and this kind of "Ge Liang" with the spirit of monkeys has actually "Zhu" to foreign countries after one "Zhu". So some "Ge Liang" are simply using the offensive of "Six Expeditions to Qishan" and sending troops again and again: if a large country is annexed, they refuse to stop; if a small port is taken back, they refuse to stop; if they gain benefits in one thing, they want to gain more, and refuse to stop; if they do not get anything in one thing, they must get it, and they refuse to stop even more: they are really going to reach the point of "dying after exerting themselves to the utmost" in Wuzhangyuan!

Moreover, nowadays, civilization is progressing and everything is surpassing the past. This kind of monkey with the "Ge Liang" spirit has actually "Zhu" to countless times after one "Zhu", and can be encountered almost everywhere on a large piece of land in China. They follow the habit of climbing trees. If there is a road, they certainly want to take it; if there is no road, they also want to break through blindly. They pick up bargains and want to pick up more. They suffer losses and want to retaliate, and they want to drill east and drill west even more. They are implementing the principle of "not stopping until they die."

Seeing these phenomena, one can only praise, "Ah, how prosperous!" They do have a firm and unyielding will and will not stop until they achieve the purpose of death.

Fortunately, heaven follows the wishes of the "monkeys". Their efforts are mostly rewarded as they wish. Some who have not yet achieved their goals will sooner or later be unable to climb if they really "do not stop". They will either fall to their death or die from fatigue.

"Grandma Liu" Wu Zhihui once had a sentence, called: "Monkeys playing with X, drawing blood." This spirit can be invented in conjunction with climbing trees. Because we can see many monkeys under the tree who have already "stopped", or monkeys who are "not stopping" but dripping with "blood". They have all become "one hill of badgers". It is a pity that this "hill" is not the "first hill".

Some people still want to persuade them not to climb endlessly like this, but it is completely useless. Because "orangutans can speak, but they do not leave beasts", there is ultimately no reason to talk to humans and beasts, so we can only watch them climb as much as they can, until they can't climb anymore.

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

Fourteen　Seeing the Light of Day Again

It can be said that Ye Guozhang's army recaptured Hepu Town without any effort, without any resistance at all, and this was true in all directions. This was entirely due to Chen Zhenzhang's clever plan to summon all the puppet troops to attend a carnival meeting and completely remove all the usual defenses. Although there were a few sentries patrolling on the road, most of them did not have time to escape back to report and were shot to death by our army. Ye Tuanzhang's three-way army, mighty and magnificent, rushed to Hepu Town and surrounded the Township Office, which had been turned into a fake "Maintenance Association". Those puppet troops were still kept in the dark, cheering and drinking freely inside the Township Office, enjoying the carnival as much as possible.

It was not until a cannon shot and rifle and machine gun sounds were mixed together, and bullets were flying into the Township Office in a chaotic manner, that they all panicked. This matter was completely unexpected for the puppet troops. They saw their officers suddenly dying with blood flowing from their seven orifices for no reason in the outer hall, and they already knew that things were not good. But they did not expect that Ye Tuanzhang's army would counterattack so quickly. They had originally come to attend a carnival meeting, and most of them did not carry weapons. At this time, they seemed to be turtles in a jar. Apart from cursing "fool" in their mouths, they had no choice but to be captured. A small number of people carrying weapons still delusionally resisted, using the walls on both sides as cover to shoot outwards. But the ammunition they carried was limited after all. When they ran out of ammunition, they had no choice but to raise the white flag.

Ye Tuanzhang ordered a unit to enter the Township Office to disarm the enemy troops and monitor the prisoners, and another unit to go to the town and nearby to search for the remaining enemy troops. He also ordered Zhao Desheng, the brigade commander, to immediately lead his troops to the southeast to establish contact with the first company and second column led by Zhu Canmou, and to deploy defenses tightly there to prevent the enemy troops in Mingxi Town from attacking. After all the deployments were completed, Ye Tuanzhang contemptuously used his command knife to pick off the plaque of the "Hepu Town Local Maintenance Association" in front of the Township Office, raised his foot, and with a "cha" sound, crushed it into pieces, and strode into the Township Office.

Inside the Township Office, there were broken cups and plates everywhere, tables and chairs were overturned, and several corpses were lying on the hall. Among them, Chen Zhenzhang's death was the most tragic. Not only was he poisoned and blood flowed from his seven orifices, but his head was also hit by a bullet from a Japanese officer, his skull was shattered, and his brains were flowing all over the ground. Although he sacrificed himself for righteousness and did not see the restoration of Hepu Town with his own eyes, his mission was undoubtedly fully completed.

Ye Tuanzhang looked at Chen Zhenzhang's tragic death and couldn't help but shed tears sadly. He personally put a blue sky, white sun, and crimson ground flag on his body and said to everyone sadly:

"Do not seek life to harm benevolence, but sacrifice life to achieve benevolence. Chen Zhenzhang has completely done this. His death is glorious, and I hope everyone can learn from his spirit of sacrificing himself for righteousness and taking righteousness over life." (45)

### Fulfilling the Ideals of the Martyrs

— Xi Meng

Our ancient, closed-off country, due to its internal corruption, could not withstand the cannons of the Opium War in 1842, and its doors were blasted open. The Chinese rural economy, gasping under cruel feudal exploitation, began to be ravaged by the giant hand of capitalism, and the entire national economy gradually moved towards colonization. Poor China, from then on, was like a small boat, floating on the terrifying waves of the ocean. If it did not fight for survival, then the danger of destruction was truly possible at any time.

But survival is a human instinct, and the Chinese people must break away from the fate of colonization in order to survive in the world. Therefore, blood debts must be paid with blood. For the sake of China's independence, freedom, and happiness, countless martyrs shed their blood on the land of their motherland. The sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang was, on the one hand, the result of their advancing fiercely along the bloody path of their predecessors, and on the other hand, it opened up a wider avenue of national revolution for us, the yet-to-die later generations.

Before the Battle of Huanghuagang, our Chinese national revolution successively included the Pingli Uprising, the Chao, Yi, Qin, and Uprising; the Zhennanguan and Hekou Uprisings, and the Guangzhou New Army Uprising. However, the Battle of Huanghuagang determined the basic elements of the victory of the Xinhai Revolution.

The martyrs of Huanghuagang sacrificed themselves, and the Xinhai Revolution eventually succeeded on the surface, but the mission of China's national revolution has not yet been completed. Until today, our great Republic of China has reached the critical moment of life and death: "It is either death or life!" The fate of the Republic of China has been decided on this all-out and long-lasting war of resistance!

The path we are taking today is, in essence, still the path taken by the martyrs of Huanghuagang. However, without a doubt, the path we are taking today is a hundred or a thousand times more difficult than the one taken by the martyrs of Huanghuagang. Today, when we commemorate the heroic sacrifice of the martyrs of Huanghuagang, first of all, we must learn their spirit of sacrificing the "small self" to fulfill the "big self." Therefore, in this arduous and long-lasting war of resistance in China, if we do not go to the battlefield, whether we are the bosses of factories and stores, or the workers and clerks of factories and stores, in short, all the people must be calm and strive to save money, and not cooperate with the enemy.

Secondly, in the period when the martyrs of Huanghuagang sacrificed themselves, the consciousness of national revolution had already spread widely among the minds of the people throughout the country. No matter how cruelly the Qing Dynasty suppressed it, the fate of the Qing Dynasty was ultimately over. And this consciousness of national revolution has not only not disappeared today, but has become even stronger. Based on past precedents, we firmly believe that our final victory in China is certain and without doubt. Therefore, today, when we commemorate the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, we must adhere to the belief that "resistance will surely be victorious and nation-building will surely succeed," and eliminate pessimistic, wavering, and compromising ideas that lead to national subjugation.

The ideals of the martyrs of Huanghuagang must be realized in this great and sacred war of resistance!

### Commemoration of the Guangzhou Uprising

— Na Jue

In today's increasingly profound national crisis, coinciding with the 29th anniversary of the martyrdom of the martyrs of the Guangzhou Uprising, our recollection of the spirit of the martyrs who gave their lives to build the country feels even more significant in its meaning.

At twelve o'clock on the night of March 29, twenty-eight years ago, the comrades of the Min Party launched another revolutionary movement in Guangzhou. In advance, Mr. Hu Hanmin secretly set up an organization to preside over everything, and dispatched Huang Keqiang and others to command the attack on the Governor's Office; unexpectedly, the plan was leaked, and the Governor's Office was already on guard, so the matter failed. In this battle, a total of more than one hundred martyrs were killed in action and captured and martyred. It was the most tragic and the last failed of all the revolutions before the Wuchang Uprising.

At that time, Mr. Pan Lengshan collected only seventy-two remains and buried them in the wilderness of the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou; although the loyal bones of the remaining dozens of martyrs were lost, their revolutionary spirit will last forever with the seventy-two martyrs.

In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, Lin Sen, the current Chairman of the National Government, moved the remains of the seventy-two martyrs to Huanghuagang, and investigated their names and origins to honor the great martyrs and repay their great achievements. The analysis of the origins of the seventy-two martyrs is as follows:

Guangdong 42 Fujian 9

Hunan 5 Guangxi 4

Zhejiang 4 Sichuan 3

Anhui 3 Jiangsu 2

In the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, the Revolutionary Memorial Association found that Xu Guotai, Hua Jinyuan and other thirteen people also participated in this battle and died on the spot; their origins were

Guangdong 9 Jiangsu 3

Guangxi 1

The revolutionary party members who sacrificed this time accounted for eight provinces, which is worthy of our attention. They only had enthusiasm, regardless of success or failure, the number of people and weapons could not be compared with the Manchu Qing government at that time, but the revolutionary martyrs felt that where righteousness lies, they could only follow one another, and continue to work hard, using the blood they shed to cultivate the seeds of the Republic of China. Therefore, the Guangzhou Uprising can be said to be the prelude to the success of the Wuchang Revolution. We must admire and emulate the spirit of the martyrs who calmly went to justice and were loyal and unyielding!

Today, when compatriots across the country commemorate the Guangzhou Uprising, I believe that everyone will have a deep feeling, and will be determined to inherit the spirit of the martyrs to complete the mission of winning the war of resistance and building the country.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

Chapter 7: Young Swallows and Orioles Show Off Their Twin Talents, Yue Luo and Wu Jin Weave Seven Splendid Patterns

Let's talk about Zhu Airen leading the two Miss He's to visit the nursery. First, they looked at the Youya Garden, and found the children to be innocent and lovely. Ms. Tong Haiying also taught them to sing, and the little girls had a kind of shy appearance. Although they sang a few children's songs, the childish voices were cute and pleasant to listen to. They also performed a game before it was time for tea. When it was time for tea, all the children sat quietly on small chairs. In front of each person was a small plate, with two cookies on the small plate. There was also a small cup, with a shallow cup of black tea in the small cup. These were all prepared by the nannies in each group, and the older kindergarten students in each group held a milk jug and poured some milk into each cup of black tea. There were also older male kindergarten students in each group, holding a sugar bowl and adding a cube of sugar to each cup of black tea. Why did they have to do it themselves? This was also a way to get used to working. Even so, the nannies were all standing by, paying attention, especially afraid that they would spill the tea cups or break the plates. After the tea, they were dismissed from school, the younger ones walking in front, and the older ones following behind, and they filed out. Zhu Airen and Tong Haiying led them to see a group of babies who were not yet able to go to kindergarten, which was the largest group in the nursery. They were also assigned to the nannies in the nursery, each nanny taking care of several children. These nannies, some were married, some were unmarried. They treated the babies they cared for as if they were their own children. And those babies treated the nannies who cared for them as if they were their own mothers. Women have a maternal instinct. I remember that among the nannies, there was a Ms. Wang, who was a widow and had no children of her own. She came to the nursery to work as a nanny, and Doctor Lao Zhang assigned her three girls and two boys to take care of. She spent all day with these little angels, putting all her troubles behind her. But these were children fostered here by others, and when it came down to it, they were still other people's children, not Ms. Wang's children, nor the nursery's children. One of the five children she cared for was a girl, who was five years old this year. Her parents had to go somewhere else for something, so they wanted to take her out of the nursery. But when Ms. Wang heard the news, she couldn't even eat her meal, and just wept. Doctor Lao Zhang comforted her, saying: "You are crazy! The parents are still there, the child is theirs, why should we be reluctant to let her go?" (73)

### Huanghuagang (Drum Ballad)

— Yi Bai

Since the Guangzhou city change, people are uneasy. Governor Zhang also knows that the situation is unusual. He is fearful and suspicious, and sends out secret agents to inquire in detail. At this time, the revolutionary party members are prepared, distributing guns and bullets and agreeing on the time. It was originally agreed to launch the uprising simultaneously on the first day of April, and the headquarters had already been set up in Guanyin Mountain. I don't know which side leaked the news, and several agencies were seized in a few days. In the blink of an eye, it was the twenty-sixth day, and the officials' inspection was even more strict and the precautions were even more busy. The leaders saw that the situation was not right, and suddenly held a meeting to discuss the plan. The time was advanced, but they were afraid that the timing would not be hot and the wish would be difficult to fulfill. They wanted to wait quietly for the first day, but the party members had already revealed their whereabouts. After a meeting with no results, the atmosphere of the search was even more tense on the twenty-eighth day. In a mansion within the Eight Banners, several boxes of violent explosives were seized. The leaders gathered again that night to discuss, and someone suggested quickly closing the shop, "The gathered party members should be disbanded immediately, otherwise, wouldn't it be a waste of effort." Everyone hesitated to speak, and one person stood up in the seat and raised his hand quickly. Said: "Today's situation is like riding a tiger, if you don't want to do it, I will go alone. It is easy to make a mountain nine feet high, but it falls short, and this time the previous efforts are ruined and more effort will be spent later. If you can't bear to sacrifice, you can't accomplish great things, and now how can you allow you to hesitate. The more you can't do it, the more you have to do it, which shows the spirit of revolution and the patriotism. Give it to me! Those who don't want to go, disband first, and the ambitious men will follow me to the battlefield"! The proposer was silent, and then it was decided that the revolution would be initiated on the twenty-ninth day.

Do you know who the person who stood up to speak was? That is the leader, the hero Huang Keqiang. His original name was Huang Xing, Keqiang was his courtesy name, he was from Hunan and studied abroad. He was tall and burly, with a full face, and his mind was meticulous and his nature was rigid. He founded a Xinghua Society in his early years, determined to overthrow the Manchu Qing. The uprising failed and he fled overseas, and the Tongmenghui expanded its organization and met Sun Yat-sen. This time he was ordered to return to China to preside over the major events, and he had already decided to do it in a grand and earth-shattering way. As the saying goes, knowing that there are tigers in the mountains, he still wants to go to the mountains, and he doesn't take failure to heart. The meeting ended and he quickly arranged, and the party members rubbed their fists and prepared to try their swords. At dusk, a large pot of dried shrimp rice was cooked, and everyone had a full meal before departure. Only the sound of cannons was heard on Guanyin Mountain, and the troops divided into five routes, filled with murderous intent. The first route attacked the Governor's Office, the second route occupied the Feilai Temple, the third route blocked the officers and soldiers and ambushed in the south of the city. The fourth route advanced along Xiaofeng Bridge to force the Banner Boundary, and the fifth route monitored the Governor's Training Institute and protected Guanyin Mountain. Who knew that the Governor's Office was prepared in advance, and issued an emergency order to strictly defend the whole area. The first route had just reached Shuangmen Bottom, and the patrol police team stopped them and opened fire. In a mixed battle, the officers and soldiers were defeated, and Jia Yuyong attacked the Governor's Office in one go. The guards inside received the news and braced themselves to resist. Only the rumbling, rumbling, bombs landed and rang in succession, and in an instant the beams collapsed and the practice broke, and fire was everywhere. Huang Keqiang led the team straight in, and Governor Zhang hurriedly took the seal and crossed the back wall. Again, the sound of the horns was loud and the killing was shouted in unison, and the guards panicked and abandoned their weapons and fled. Seeing that the Governor's Office was captured, suddenly the Admiral of the Navy led troops to increase the defense. The party members were trapped in the Gaehe and could not use their strength, and first the trumpeter Lin Wenzhong was shot. Huang Keqiang threw the bomb again, and inadvertently his right hand was injured by three fingers. There was no way to break out of the encirclement and flee, and the other four routes therefore lost their positions at the same time. Guanyin Mountain put down the red light to order the retreat of the troops, and the officers and soldiers took advantage of the situation to chase like tigers and wolves. Some of the party members failed to retreat in time and were captured, and some of the party members fought to the death in the battle. Only the blood flowed into rivers and the corpses lay everywhere, only the sky was sad and the earth was miserable and the stars and moon were without light. Huang Keqiang knew that things were not good and ran away quickly, disguising himself and leaving the South Gate. After the officers and soldiers searched for the revolutionary party, most of the party members who had not left committed suicide, and those who were captured were interrogated, one by one, they were excited and impassioned, regardless of the iron chains, some laughed, some cursed, no one showed fear, which made the interrogating officials ashamed. There was a young man in a suit with a handsome appearance, but his words were very straightforward and fierce. He said: "You only know how to respectfully follow the orders and be slaves, have you ever detailed the world situation? Whose China is China now? You are willing to be a lackey and hurt your brothers and sisters. Stupid things! What are you sitting on to ask me? You won't die this time, Zhang Mingqi! Your life won't be long either. Do you know what is called revolution? We are saving the danger for the survival of the nation. It is better to die for freedom than to live as a slave. Look at the smile on your face, you know your blood is cold". Before the scolding was over, one person hurriedly interjected, saying: "Comrade Lin, you are too warm-hearted. Why talk theory with this kind of dog slave, dogs! We are all revolutionary parties, and we don't need to investigate." The interrogating official said with shame when he heard the words: "Isn't this kind of action of yours absurd, what kind of rebellion are you making without any plan, and aren't you ashamed to be captured today"? With a clang, the iron chain shook and someone shouted: "Nonsense! Do you think we failed? Haha, watch out! Maybe tomorrow you will have to pay for your life." After asking again and again, there was no clue, and one by one they calmly went to justice and returned to heaven. Seventy-two martyrs were martyred, and their remains were buried in Huanghuagang after they became benevolent. The Republic of China was founded on this one move, and the martyrs, from then on, their names will be recorded in the annals of history and will be famous forever. This is a historical fact of March 29th, and later there was the Wuchang Uprising to return my rivers and mountains. (End)

Entertainment Circle

### War of Resistance and Entertainment

— Wang Tao

This war of resistance is the most difficult life-and-death struggle, and we should strengthen our combat and strength in all aspects; especially in the second phase of the war of resistance, which is a period of full-scale combat and more difficult times, so we should mobilize in all aspects to strive for the final victory and national liberation!

Therefore, the practitioners in the entertainment circle should also participate in the torrent of the war of resistance and shoulder the active mission of resisting the enemy. Although we are on the isolated island surrounded by demons, we cannot forget that we are still descendants of the Yellow Emperor with blood, and we cannot forget that our motherland is growing up in the midst of a bitter struggle. We should stand under the big banner of resisting the enemy, unite closely, and shoulder the sacred responsibility of the war of resistance for the sake of the country and for ourselves.

Moreover, entertainment is an excellent tool for educating the masses, and we should make good use of it to exert its great educational power. As everyone knows, simply taking sexually suggestive and low-level tastes can no longer attract the general audience and listeners. On the contrary, we can point out that in a certain comedy class in the entertainment arena, singing a "Refugee Hardship," when singing about the enemy's madness and cruelty, and the pain of refugees being displaced, immediately won a fierce applause from the audience and won the audience's enthusiastic love.

It can be seen that in any entertainment sector, as long as we instill the awareness of resisting the war and building the country, it will definitely be accepted by the audience immediately. At the same time, it also shows the determination of the Chinese people, and the Chinese people fully hold an optimistic and firm belief in the future of the war of resistance.

Dear gentlemen in the entertainment industry! Strive! For the motherland, for the Chinese nation, and for ourselves, we should use various methods to permeate the audience's hearts with the awareness of resisting the enemy! Entertainment that instills the awareness of resisting the enemy in the lyrics is the new entertainment, the progressive entertainment, and it is also what the public needs! Because the new and progressive entertainment is growing together with the revived China!

### Three Great Masters of Jing Role: Hao, Hou, and Jin

— Plum Blossom Hermitage Master

In recent years, the talents of the Jing role have become increasingly rare. Qiu Guixian has passed away, Dong Junfeng is down and out, and there is no successor in the copper hammer school. Qiu Zisheng is in the military, and there is more hope, but recently he is still too thin in energy and lacks courage; Wang Quankui has good materials, but unfortunately there is no famous teacher to correct him, and he is crudely made, which is not enough to enter the hall of elegance: The only ones who rely on to support the Jing role situation and whose reputation is becoming increasingly prosperous, looking around the north and south, are only Jin Shaoshan, Hao Shouchun, and Hou Xirui.

Jin is the son of the famous Jing, Jin Xiushan. He first studied the second Jing, and was not valued by people. Since he partnered with Mei Wan Hua to play Farewell My Concubine, his momentum has been greatly boosted. In recent years, he has devoted himself to the plays of the positive Jing, which are magnificent and wonderful. Last year, he went north and formed his own big class, and hung the head brand as the Jing role. His momentum is unprecedented for the Jing role. Last autumn, he took Wu Suqiu to travel in the three northeastern provinces for two months, earning more than 10,000 yuan. He did not return with praise until the beginning of winter. He gained both fame and fortune. Shaoshan is truly a lucky child! Jin's plays are best in terms of frame, such as Lianhuan Tao, Famen Temple, and the three plays of Trial of Li Qi, which are his masterpieces. The kung fu of the positive Jing plays is not weak either, such as the Imperial Fruit Garden, the Grass Bridge Pass, the Dragon Robe, the Ascension to Heaven, and the Breaking of the Secret Gap. Most of the plays are learned from the record player. The pronunciation and singing are based on his ancestors. Xiushan had many records left during his lifetime, and Shaoshan's tune is almost completely obtained from the records.

Hao Shouchun, named Rui, is from Jingzhao and is the direct disciple of the famous Jing Li Lianzhong. His stage name was Xiao Kuilu when he was a child, and he partnered with Datou (Gui Fen) to play the play "Taking the Marshal's Seal," which was highly praised by the audience. His name rose from this. Later, due to a broken voice, he changed from Zheng Jing to Fu Jing. Because he admired Huang San's plays, he devoted himself to Huang San as a method. He is most famous for performing Cao Cao's plays, so he has the reputation of "Living Cao Cao" for a time. He is able to perform many plays, such as除三害, 忠孝全, 下河東, 賽太歲, 白綾計, 飛虎夢, 法鬥寺, 黃一刀, 連環套, 陽平關, which are especially called masterpieces. He partnered with Yang Xiaolou in the two plays of 野猪林 大名府, which were a perfect combination and enjoyed even more fame. Now he is retired and living at home, no longer showing his unique skills to others.

Hou Xirui, Xirui is a graduate of the first class of the Chang Liancheng Science Society. After leaving the class, he also followed Li Lianzhong to study Fu Jing. His martial arts skills are far above Jin and Hao. Although his voice does not meet the requirements of the Jing role, he is good at using it. Therefore, when he dresses up and appears on stage, he has his own domineering aura. His singing and lines are all based on Huang San, and he is on par with Hao Shouchun, without distinction. 丁甲山, 盜御馬, 鬧江州, 戰宛城, 霸王莊 are his immortal works. Occasionally, he partners with Wan Hua to play An Lushan in The Legend of the True Princess, and with Yu Shuang to play Qiu Ran Gong in The Three Heroes of the Wind and Dust, and with Qi Xia to play Deng Jiugong in The Thirteenth Sister, all of which have unique features. Unfortunately, there has been no opportunity to meet for a long time.

Cuihong used to be a famous singer in Qinhuai, and she has been cultivated in Pingju art for a long time. She has also made several films before, which are still worth watching. It is also an appropriate character for Yihua to appoint as the protagonist of this film.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City and the Pear Garden in the Former Capital (132)

— Xu Muyun

In the old feudal era, people who adhered to the old etiquette emphasized titles and origins. Even treacherous figures like Cao Cao and Sima Shi could carry out palace coups, but they left the act of usurpation to their sons. One even taught his descendants to put on a show of abdication, blinding the common people. This shows how important the ancients considered "rectifying names and defining roles." Although Zhuge Liang is portrayed as a person with Taoist skills in dramas, in reality, his character and learning were at least virtuous if not saintly. When we read his "Chu Shi Biao" (Memorial on Dispatching the Army), we cannot help but feel admiration upon reading the lines "I will exhaust myself in the performance of my duty until death!" At the same time, we also feel that Liu Chan, the little rascal, did not value his father's legacy. When Mr. Zhuge was launching his six expeditions to Qishan and nine campaigns to the Central Plains, if he had not repeatedly caused trouble in the rear and listened to slander for no reason, recalling his Shangfu from the front lines, he might have already destroyed Wei and Wu and unified the Central Plains. When Kongming first assisted the late lord, he endured a lot of resentment from Zhang Fei. If he had not been tolerant, he would have long returned to his Wolonggang. During Zhang Fei's intrusion into the tent in the play "Yellow Crane Tower," he grabbed Zhuge Liang and repeatedly demanded the return of his elder brother. That kind of barbaric and unreasonable behavior was truly infuriating. Later, when Xuande returned safely without losing a single hair, Zhang Fei gradually changed his rough and barbaric nature. Speaking of Guan Erye, he was from the west and even more stubborn. His obstinate nature was unyielding. In his eyes, he only respected his elder brother and looked down on everyone else. If Zhuge Liang, who initially assisted Xuande, had not displayed some divine powers and used some means to subdue Guan and Zhang, then all future military orders would have been ineffective. They were sworn brothers with the late lord, sharing life and death. He could not beat them or kill them. They would often lose their tempers in front of the three armies and the generals, calling him an old Taoist priest and questioning how this electrician could command the troops. Therefore, before subduing the rash Zhang Laosan, Kongming had to first subdue the arrogant Lao Er so that he could act boldly. Afterwards, issuing orders would not be met with contempt from Guan and Zhang, thus avoiding delays in military operations. Guan Yu had received kindness from Cao Cao. When the two met, they would inevitably reminisce about old feelings. As the saying goes, "Force can subdue the strong." Mengde was a cunning hero, and Yunchang was a tough man. When Cao Cao was in a desperate situation, showing a little weakness to his old friend (xiǎ xiǎo meaning begging for mercy), Guan Gong would be reminded of old feelings, and his heart would involuntarily let Cao Cao go.

### Finance: Both Cash Supply and Demand are Sluggish

Only Over Two Hundred Taels Traded All Day

Yesterday's cash speculation market conditions were dull due to the indifference of brokers, with almost no interest. Therefore, trading was extremely light, and prices were slightly weak and stable, hovering around 2,080 yuan. Although a certain gold shop continued to buy, Silver Banks and another gold shop successively sold, causing the price to fall by another two yuan. The transaction volume was 200 taels in the morning and 70 taels in the afternoon. Gold jewelry in silver shops remained firm, while customs gold and Sino-British pure gold rose slightly.

Speculative Red Drops Only Two Yuan

Since morning, each bar of ten taels initially had little trading volume due to scarce supply and demand. It was not until after 10:00 that a certain gold shop advanced fifty taels from the Silver Bank, with an opening price of 2,081 yuan, slightly different from the closing price of the previous day. After opening, a certain gold shop advanced another fifty taels from the same industry at the same price, followed by another fifty taels from the same industry at a price of 80 yuan. Thereafter, supply and demand turned sluggish again, and the price also stagnated. It was not until around 11:00 that the Silver Bank mutually traded fifty taels at a price of 79 yuan. Until noon, there was no trading, so the noon closing price remained at 79 yuan. In the afternoon, the lack of supply and demand became more pronounced, so the situation was quite stable. Initially, the gold shop sold fifty taels to the Silver Bank at a price of 79 yuan. Later, until 4:00, the gold shop sold another twenty taels to a money exchange business at a price of 2,079 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, it dropped by two yuan compared to the previous day's noon closing price. (The difference throughout the day was only two yuan.) The selling price of cash gold from this shop was 2,090 yuan, and the buying price was 2,075 yuan. The current spot gold price was about 500,000 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with no trading.

Gold Jewelry Remains Firm at the Original Price

The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops has not changed because the speculative red has remained stable. Da Tong Hang still lists 211 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang lists 209 yuan, with a buying price of 203 yuan.

Pure Gold Suddenly Increases by Half a Penny

A London cable on the 27th reported that British pure gold suddenly increased by half a penny per ounce, reaching £7, 8 shillings, 5 and a half pence. As a result, the Bank of China's cash purchase price also rose to 1,211 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold also increased by 2%, totaling 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The high price of the Shanghai standard sample also rose by 3 jiao, totaling 1,207 yuan and 2 jiao.

### Demand for Japanese Currency is Uniquely Strong

Yesterday, British pure gold rose by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate rose by 0.0625. Foreign exchange, oil companies, and foreign firms in this port had substantial settlements. Foreign banks and Hong Kong Telecom provided ample supply, and supply and demand were equal. The market price was extremely stable. Retail investors of speculative red slightly absorbed, and gold shops and money exchange businesses supplied ample supply. The market price changed very little, and the trend was hovering and weak. Because the exchange rate was stable, the transaction volume of foreign currency was sparse, the market price was hovering, with slight fluctuations. Only the demand for Japanese gold notes was very strong. The guild's transactions were not open. Yesterday's market price: the British gold pound decreased by 1 jiao, the British gold note increased by 1 fen, the American surplus note decreased by 1 li, the Dutch note increased by 5 fen, the Italian note decreased by half a fen, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Although Month-End Settlements are Busy, Foreign Exchange is Not Affected

The foreign exchange market yesterday was busy due to the approaching month-end, with frequent settlements by oil companies, foreign firms, Asiatic Petroleum, and major foreign firms. However, Hong Kong continued to dump, and foreign firms such as HSBC were still willing to supply, so the potential trend was quite stable, and there were few changes in the middle. Trading was brisk in the morning and extremely light in the afternoon. The Hong Kong exchange rate remained unchanged because supply and demand corresponded.

Initially, the London large bars narrowed by 0.0625 for both near and far terms, New York silver prices remained flat, London raw gold increased by half a penny, the exchange rate of British against American increased by 7 hao, against French increased by a small 3 centimes, against Shanghai increased by 3.75 (quoted but no market), American against British increased by 0.0625, against French increased by 0.0625, against Shanghai unchanged. The central listed exchange rates remained as before. The bank's morning opening selling price of British exchange was 8 pence and 25, and the American exchange was 16 yuan and 0.09375, which were the same as the previous closing prices. After opening, oil companies and Asiatic Petroleum first settled with HSBC at 8 pence and 25 for British exchange, and the situation was quite stable. When HSBC's listed prices were revealed to be unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was revealed to be a little over half a point, calculated as 4.50%, Hong Kong suddenly offered the Dutch exchange to Holland at 16 yuan and 125 for American exchange, so the trend was even more stable. Then, a foreign firm settled with a certain bank at 16 yuan and 0.09375 for American exchange. Later, the foreign firm absorbed 55 yuan and 375 for the Dutch Anta Hong Kong exchange, and the situation remained unchanged. Until the noon closing, the bank's selling price was the same as the morning opening.

In the afternoon, foreign firms' settlements turned sparse, and Hong Kong Telecom also stopped dumping, so the situation was quite quiet, and the price was stable. It was only heard that a foreign firm settled with HSBC at 8 pence and 25 for British exchange (today's term). There was no trading in the Hong Kong and Shanghai exchange rates. Until the evening closing, the bank's selling price was 8 pence and 25 for British exchange and 16 yuan and 0.09375 for American exchange. As a result, both the British and American exchange rates did not rise or fall, and the Hong Kong exchange rate also did not rise or fall. The day's trading records are listed below.

### Securities: Salt Tax Guaranteed Foreign Debt Soars

British-German and British-French Bonds Jump Five Pounds, Other Debts Rise One or Two Pounds, Only Domestic Debt is Constrained by the Environment and Cannot Rise

The London Chinese Foreign Currency Bonds market prices on the 27th of this month (Monday) were stimulated by the remarks made by Finance Minister Kong, rising by one to five pounds. Only the British-German continued loan and British-French bonds decreased slightly by half a pound, with a price of 74 and a half pounds. Salt tax guaranteed bonds, because this period's interest is guaranteed, the British-French loan and British-French bonds jumped by five pounds, with a price of sixty pounds. The Hukwang Railway Bonds issued in German with stamps also jumped by two and a half pounds, with a price of twenty and a half pounds. The Crisp Bonds and the Customs Guaranteed Rehabilitation Bonds issued in British currency each rose by two pounds, with prices of thirty pounds and fifty-one and a half pounds, respectively. The Longhai Railway Bonds and various other railway bonds also each rose by one pound, with the Longhai Railway Bonds at seventeen and a half pounds, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bonds at twenty-five pounds, and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bonds originally issued at seventeen pounds. There were no other changes. The buying and selling prices of the Rehabilitation Bonds issued in British currency were fifty and a half pounds for buying and fifty-one pounds for selling.

The Mercantile Bank shares rose another two shillings and six pence, with a price of eight pounds and fifteen shillings. The HSBC shares continued to rise by one pound, with a price of eighty-five pounds. The Kaiping Coal Mine shares continued to rise by nine pence, with a price of eighteen shillings. There were no other changes.

Yesterday's security gray market conditions were relieved due to the Ministry of Finance's statement on continuing to maintain creditworthiness. At the same time, people felt softened by the sudden emergency in Nanchang. Looking at the situation on the table, the long positions of large investors insisted on not releasing, and the chips were very dry. Considering the environmental instability, many small and retail investors released a lot, causing the market to be unable to rise. Therefore, the market situation was uncertain, fluctuating within one or two jiao. In this situation, even small fluctuations were limited. Yesterday's events: The Class C stocks revolved around 51 yuan in the morning, and the Class E stocks revolved around 50 yuan, which was generally slightly firmer than the day before. However, the Class A stocks were slightly weak. Runli, Lemao, Lianhe, and Hengfu bought, while No. 5, No. 38, Songmao, and Tongkang sold. Qiafeng sold Class A and bought Class E, so the price was fiercely supported and evenly matched. In the afternoon, Qiafeng and Runli absorbed, while Tiansheng and Tongkang sold, still evenly matched, revolving around the key points. Because there was a one-day holiday today, people were even more afraid to take action, and the market price results were uneven. The Class C and E stocks had no ups and downs at all, and the others differed by only 5 fen or 1 jiao. The total transaction volume was about 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day

Unified A 5740 5720 5735 Down 0.05

Unified B 5140 5090 5135 Up 0.10

Unified C 5110 5075 5080 Flat

Unified D 4985 4970 4975 Up 0.05

96 655 —— 655 Down 0.05

Stock trading: more than 80 shares of Huashang Electric shares were traded, with prices of 5 yuan, 3 jiao, 7 fen, and a half, and 5 yuan and 4 jiao.

### North and South Goods: Walnut Control

Market Rises Gradually

Due to restrictions on the source of walnuts by a certain party, the curtain is tightening day by day, and market prices are mostly shouting high. For example, Matou walnuts, which were previously sold for 26 or 27 yuan, now require 30 yuan. Hand-picked walnuts are shouting to rise by 4 or 5 yuan, and all others are following suit. There is still a possibility of continued tightening in the future.

### Silk and Tea: Silk Awaits Movement after Prolonged Export Stagnation

Fifty Bundles of Chi Li Silk

The overseas silk market had very slight fluctuations. The New York silk prices remained unchanged. The exchange's opening price rose by half a point for the near term and fell by half a point for the far term. The Yokohama raw silk price slightly fell by 5 yuan for spot goods and remained stable for the far term. The Lyons prices rose by 1 franc each. The Shanghai factory's exports have gradually developed, because the actual sales have been sluggish for a long time. Some factories are eager to sell, and speculators are also hoping to emerge. Therefore, yesterday, the French factory issued 2,022 bundles back at 1,650 yuan, so a transaction was possible. Robin Hood's spleen was uneven and returned, selling for 1,700 yuan, which was purchased by a certain bank. The transaction was 50 bundles. The upper body Chi Li silk's sales to the United States are gradually becoming active. The sixth-grade top brand was traded yesterday for 50 bundles, with a price of 1,000 yuan. Observing the market situation, if the customer does not raise the price too high, then the development of silk sales is promising.

Today, eighty-one pieces of Hu silk will be shipped to Europe.

### Cotton Yarn: Yarn Market Changes Three Times a Day

Although Market Prices Fell, Actual Sales Were Still Sluggish, Accounting for Only One-Fifth of the Transaction Volume

The yarn market is still in a flat and weak state and fluctuates greatly, rising and falling erratically, making it difficult to grasp. In fact, since the continuous decline in recent days, the extent of the decline has been deep. The market situation is slightly stable, and those who pick up the wind are coming to drag in, immediately rising. Because customer sales are still as sluggish as before, and the price has risen back, causing speculators to come out again, it enters a weak path in an instant. In short, the environment is poor, making people uncertain. Judging from the market trend, because it has fallen by more than 20 yuan in these five days, there may be a major spin for a while. What will happen in the future? We still have to wait for the actual needs to be healthy before the market price can make a direction. The sellers were scarcer in the afternoon, but the customer needs were still weak.

As for the current yarn situation, rumors were flying at the market's opening this morning, and most people did not see it well, or there was still room to fall, so the opening price fell by 2 yuan. The unit price of 20-count Double Horse stack was 363 yuan and a half. After a short while, a certain yarn shop was determined and came to pull up, absorbing a huge amount and releasing prices to buy in, so the market price gradually rose, and the market suddenly appeared disordered. The prices in the market varied. In a short while, the unit price of 20-count Double Horse stack rose to 368 yuan, and the spot yarn was priced at 369 yuan, which was 4 and a half yuan higher than the opening price. However, after the price rose, many short sellers took the opportunity to close out, and it weakened again, falling back by 2 yuan. The spot Double Horse price was 367 yuan. The brokers poured into the market in the afternoon, but transactions were still rare, and the market price moved between 1 yuan without major changes. According to the statistics of transactions of various gangs throughout the day, there were 1,430 packages. The price of 20-count Double Horse Heavenly Girl was 5 jiao higher than the previous day. The Tianjin gang's demand for 10-count coarse yarn was still strong, and the market was relatively flat. The factory side did not take any action. Yesterday, 50 pieces of yarn arrived from Hong Kong, and today, 10 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 250 pieces were shipped to Shantou, and 25 pieces were shipped to Xiamen. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left:

Peers: 1,135 Tianjin: 245 Hong Kong: 5

Xiamen: 25 Sichuan: 10 Wenzhou: 5

Mainland: 1 Total: 1,430

The Japanese yarn market remained firm and expensive, and it ran counter to the Chinese yarn market, continuing to rise. However, the demand was not strong, and most people were optimistic, so the bulls were pulling tight and not loosening. The spot price of 20-count Water Moon yarn was 341-2 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 331-2 yuan, about 1.2 yuan higher than the previous day.

### It's Difficult for US Cotton Export Subsidies to be Realized, Japanese Factories Compete to Buy Brazilian Cotton

Cotton Prices Fall One After Another

The foreign cotton market price and the New York cotton market both feel quiet, likely because all companies are waiting for developments in Washington. However, the news from Washington is contradictory and difficult to grasp. Yesterday, there were widespread rumors that the proposal for cotton export subsidies may not be realized, but that the release of loan cotton could be implemented within days. This claim is currently difficult to verify. Yesterday, the New York cotton market rose two to three points due to good news from Liverpool. Indian futures were also predicted to rise two rupees, and Egyptian futures rose more than twenty points. Exchange rates were relatively stable yesterday, and cotton prices converted to legal tender all increased, with American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rising thirty cents, Indian cotton rising more than fifty cents, and Egyptian cotton rising one yuan.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, due to the war situation, the yarn price has not improved, so cotton mills are very lukewarm about purchasing raw cotton. Only Xinyu received 1,000 bales of Indian cotton, White Broach. Japanese factories were active yesterday, and they handled thousands of bales of foreign cotton again yesterday. Among them, Gongda imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton, Shanghai imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton, Rihua imported 500 bales of American cotton, and Donghua and other companies each imported 1,000 bales of Brazilian cotton. The prices of foreign cotton yesterday are recorded below:

Raw Material Category Price delivered to factory, including tax

60 count Egyptian cotton, superior grade 107.90

Also Also Medium grade 105.00

80 count Also Superior grade 131.95

Also Also Medium grade 23.80

20 count American Middling 84.50

Also Also Lower grade 71.30

32 count Also 93.30

Also Also Lower grade 82.45

42 count Also 95.15

Also Also Lower grade 83.35

Also South American Brazilian cotton Superior grade 88.90

Also Also Medium grade 85.60

Also Also Lower grade 76.45

10 count Indian No. 1 Good 63.05

16 count Indian Oomra 65.65

20 count Also 73.40

24 count Indian White Broach 80.80

32 count American M. T. 86.00

31 count 42 count American Pengapu 90.45

The native cotton business has suddenly become cold, and the market price is also trending downwards. This is because yarn sales are sluggish and prices have plummeted, making it difficult for factories to operate and reducing profits. Therefore, there is no need for raw materials at all, and all purchases have stopped. As a result, the price of Tonghua cotton suddenly fell by 1.5 yuan, and the price of Huo Ji cotton also fell by more than 50 cents. The source of Su Bei is smooth, and 1,003 bales of Tongzhou fine lint cotton arrived at the dock, as well as 570 pieces of Qidong cotton. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left:

Changshu Mozi 74.50 Wang Fulong Import 210 bales Cash on delivery at warehouse

Huo Ji Cotton 71.20 Imported by fellow traders 200 bales Also Also

Also 70.75 Also 160 bales Also Also

Tongzhou Cotton 78.70 Also 200 bales Wire transfer at warehouse

### Grains: Northern Merchants Make Large Purchases, Flour Mills Gradually Stabilize

Foreign Flour Also Rises by Five Cents, Local Wheat Priced at Seven Yuan

Factory Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour market gradually became active. Since local flour and foreign flour began competing for sales, the factory has been giving the Northern merchants promotions, resulting in two rounds of special price competition, which has inevitably attracted the attention of customers. According to news from Tianjin, the local market price can be sold for 5.23 yuan, which is quite profitable. Therefore, the Northern merchants have recently made large purchases of both foreign flour and local flour. The total transaction volume has reached more than 200,000 bags in recent days. However, the Southern merchants have only had scattered transactions due to the current situation, so the factory price has not changed. It is reported that yesterday's retail prices for local flour and Southern merchants were still 4.55 yuan, while prices for Northern customers and returned goods were exceptions. The market trend may stabilize for a while.

Foreign Flour: Yesterday, the foreign flour market also trended upwards. It was found that a ship of new American flour arrived at the end of last week. In addition to the gradual distribution to various customers and retail sales, the floating capital on the market has decreased. The Northern merchants' demand has been quite good recently, so most of the wholesale dealers are unwilling to sell lightly. Yesterday, they offered more than 40,000 bags of high-end brands such as "Jing Ri Dang Tian", priced at 4.3 yuan in cash and 4.5 yuan for medium-grade flour via wire transfer, which is an increase of five cents compared to before.

Wheat: The market has been maintained for a long time. In recent days, some scattered small lots have arrived from Zhenjiang and Yangzhou. The goods are holding firmly because of high costs. However, the flour market has been declining recently, and the environment is unfavorable. Therefore, sellers have had to make some concessions. Yesterday, more than 300 bags of Zhenjiang wheat were offered at a price of 7 yuan, which was handled by the customer. However, the factory's purchase price is still within 7 yuan.

Exports: Yesterday, 46,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin and 3,000 bags were shipped to Yantai. Today, 7,000 bags will be shipped to Shantou and 3,000 bags to Xiamen. 2,000 bags of wheat bran will be shipped to Shantou.

### Du Mi's Stabilized Situation

Rice Prices at Menzhuang Have Broken the Limit, Jingwu Xian Rice Continues to Arrive

The source of Du rice is still scarce, with only the 7th truck arriving at Hexia, with more than 700 bags from Baozi Su and others, more than 1,000 bags from Xi, 7-800 bags from Chang, and 125 bags from Kunshan. Therefore, the sellers' intentions are still firm. Sales in this area are moving but not solid, and the hoarding is also weak, so the result is a reluctant stabilization. In fact, the situation is already showing softness. The prices of thick and thin Japonica rice are all maintained at the original levels. Du Yang Jian, Bu Jian, and Bian Yuan also have no changes.

The customer's Xian rice has a tendency to hoard and sell back, and the rising trend has been thwarted again. Jingwu Xian rice continues to be transported by truck, and the owners' intention to sell has eased. However, this street and the customer's hoarding are taking advantage of the half-absorption. It is also heard that the highest price of Japonica rice in the market has reached 14.4 yuan, a 4-cent increase. Retailers are also greedy, and the total transaction volume for the day has increased to 3,700-3,800 bags. The market is tired but stabilized again. The selling price of Wu Xian rice is similar to the previous market, and the high-quality goods have been maintained. Jing Xian rice is also offered at a price of 13.35 yuan.

### Oilcake: Soybean Oil Prices Fluctuate

Crude Oil Futures Fall by One Yuan

Peanut oil has promising sales to customers, but is sluggish locally. Furthermore, sources continue to arrive, and Jiaozhou oil (transported by sailboat) for delivery in April is still being sold off. Yesterday, 150 pieces were traded at a price of 27 yuan, which is a sharp drop of one yuan compared to the previous market. The situation has not yet stabilized.

Soybean Oil: Following the indications from the previous day, the market opened weakly. Later, telegrams were tight, and the situation became clear. The market price once exceeded the previous day's closing price by 2-30 cents. However, in the afternoon, it was known that the Dalian market was downstream, and general operators turned from buying to selling, resulting in a flat result. The previous day's closing price is now the standard for buying and selling, and there is no certainty at all. Therefore, speculation by outsiders is even more blind. The transaction volume yesterday decreased compared to the previous market, but there were many twists and turns throughout the day. According to the overall market, 50 barrels of Fengnian oil were offered at the original price of 32.2 yuan, 200 barrels of Dalian spot oil were priced from 32.55 yuan to 32.3 yuan, 600 barrels for April were also priced from 32.55 yuan to 32.3 yuan, 400 barrels for May were also flat, and the spot oil market was priced from 32.55 yuan to 32.4 yuan. Soybean cake spot goods were not opened. The price of Dalian futures cake was opened at more than 15,000 pieces, priced at 3.13 yuan for May and 3.161-3.165 yuan for June, a decrease of 2-30 cents compared to the previous market. Soybean exports: Yesterday, 30 tons were shipped to Bombay, and today 1,040 bags will be shipped to Xiamen and 400 bags to Hong Kong.

### Piece Goods: Scheduled Goods from Wenzhou and Ningbo Are Resold One After Another

Hong Kong and Guangdong are the Most Enthusiastic in Adding Purchases, Dyed and Unfinished Cloth Sales Continue on this Street

Domestic cloth is slightly weak. This is because the amount of goods loaded by the Wenzhou and Ningbo merchants in eastern Zhejiang is extremely small, and the products scheduled by various factories are resold on the market. The market situation is extremely chaotic. However, the factories' intentions are very firm because the cost of weaving has not decreased, and the Japanese cloth market is stable. The selling price of Japanese fine twill has increased, exceeding that of fine cloth, so the fine twill business of this factory is assisted by spot sales, and the price is still firm. Fine cloth and coarse cloth continue to decline by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. Coarse twill is in short supply in the market due to the sudden increase in the destination of dyed fabrics. The factory has opened a price increase of 1-20 cents per piece. The price of Ewo & Co.'s Golden Pagoda bleached cloth has fallen by 10 cents per piece. The price of bleached fine twill from various factories has risen by 1-20 cents per piece. Actual sales are most enthusiastic from Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants, with more than 300 boxes of various colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, poplin, bleached twill, fine cloth, and fine twill being traded. The Tianjin merchants in the north specifically purchased more than 100 boxes of patterned goods such as patterned cloth, poplin, and khaki cloth. Retail sales in this area and sales in the inland guerrilla areas are also quite colorful. The factory is still rushing to produce popular goods day and night to meet sales, and dyeing factories are purchasing a huge amount of unfinished fabrics such as fine twill, satin, patterned cloth, and poplin.

East cloth fell in the morning but rebounded at noon, and the trend is still firm. This is because the dyed and unfinished fabrics of fine cloth and fine twill continue to be sold on this street, and the inventory of fine twill is insufficient, and spot goods are particularly tight. The price of lower-grade actual-sale fine twill was shouted up to 11.7 yuan per piece yesterday, and then raised by another 10 cents. The rise and fall of fine cloth are uncertain and difficult to grasp. The price of Longtou once fell to 11.875 yuan in the early market, but then rebounded and was shouted to 12 yuan at closing time. The overall market trend is not too small.

Exports: Yesterday, 400 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Dalian and 500 pieces were shipped to Yantai. Today, 120 pieces will be shipped to Shantou, 20 pieces to Xiamen, and 100 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Diaoqing Arrives in a Rush, Market More Sluggish

Yesterday, due to the rising forward price of 24 Dutch coarse white sugar in June and July by 10 cents, the trade association uniformly followed suit and shouted up the price of spot goods and transit goods. However, today is the day of closing the customs, resulting in few transactions. Only hundreds of packages of high-grade white sugar from local sugar factories were offered at 23.3 yuan, and the second-grade sugar was offered at 22.6 yuan. Diaoqing sugar: It was found that yesterday the Jinan Wheel from Xiamen imported an overwhelming amount, reaching a total of 3,979 bags, as well as 450 bags of Taikoo White sugar, 300 pieces of box sugar, 33 pieces of rock sugar, and 411 bags of Haikou red sugar transferred from Hong Kong. With so many Diaoqing arrivals, the market is even more sluggish, and the market is bound to fall.

Yesterday's imports: 410 bags of sugar from Hong Kong, 4,765 bags from Xiamen.

### Seafood: Wenzhou Dried Shrimp Rose Again by Two Yuan

Raw Starch Arrives Sparsely, Sales are Active

Dried Shrimp: Various merchants continue to handle Wenzhou goods, and the market is tight. Yesterday, the price of Kaicheng was sold at 64 yuan, which is an increase of 2 yuan compared to before.

Raw Starch: Demand is still high, and arrivals are scarce, so the market is quite firm. For example, the current market price for Fei Qilin brand is 17 yuan, and the price for 3X brand is 16.5 yuan, both up half a yuan.

### Metals: Eastern White Iron's Downturn Has Not Stopped

Since the factory has been vigorously pushing out Eastern white iron, coupled with frequent arrivals, the market has been in a slump. The local merchants and Rong merchants are rarely purchasing, so the standard is difficult to be optimistic.
