(Geneva) The drafting committee regarding the reply to the application submitted by Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, to the League of Nations Administrative Council, met today to draft a resolution stating that it would re-apply to member states of the League of Nations for methods beneficial to China's resistance to Japanese aggression.

(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a meeting this morning to discuss the suggestions made by Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, in his speech to the Administrative Council yesterday. British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet did not intend to take any further action beyond the resolutions previously passed by the League of Nations. At that time, the Chinese representative insisted on China's just claims, and the representatives of Bolivia, New Zealand, and the Soviet Union unanimously expressed their support for China's claims. The Administrative Council then decided to appoint representatives from Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Latvia, and China to form a drafting committee to review Gu's suggestions. However, due to Britain's firm refusal to handle any major issues within the League of Nations framework, there is little hope that the League of Nations can agree on concrete measures. The Administrative Council drafting committee is scheduled to meet tonight or tomorrow morning (Dispatch on the 23rd)

(Geneva) In their speeches at the open meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council yesterday, British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet solemnly declared their continued allegiance to the League of Nations. Halifax said that Britain's commitment is aimed at resisting the rampant use of force, because if it continues, civilization will be transformed into chaos. Halifax did not announce the details of the British-Soviet talks, but said that in this environment, although the British government cannot use the League of Nations institutions to implement various policies that it considers necessary, all actions strictly adhere to the principles of the League of Nations. Britain will inform the League of Nations Administrative Council at the earliest opportune moment of the results of continuous negotiations and the methods agreed upon and implemented by the governments concerned, and stated that the above-mentioned methods strictly adhere to the spirit of the League of Nations, aiming to maintain its security, order, and the highest ideals of peace. Halifax did not mention that the British government adheres to the principle of international cooperation, and that the League of Nations is its symbol. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)

(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held an open meeting this afternoon. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and French Interior Minister Bonnet both attended and expressed their opinions, which was beyond the expectations of many people. Foreign Secretary Halifax said that since September of last year, the European situation has undergone many changes, and the British government has had to accept certain constraints, with the intention of resisting all attempts to forcibly resolve various single issues, in order to avoid turmoil and anarchy. The principles of the League of Nations Covenant are still adhered to by Britain, and it is hoped that member and non-member states will be able to cooperate again in the future. The British government is also preparing for this kind of cooperation. Although the events it has launched in the recent period have not been notified to the League of Nations, they are in accordance with the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant. Once the current negotiations are successful, they will be submitted in writing. Foreign Minister Bonnet spoke next, agreeing with the opinions, and said that there are two paths for the nations of the world to follow: cooperation or attempts to control. "We are member states of the League of Nations and have decided to cooperate, and we are willing to unanimously resist attempts at military control." We want to seek security cooperation and peace within the scope of the League of Nations Covenant, which has failed. Now we must achieve it through other methods, especially based on the spirit of the Covenant. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax said a moment ago that after the current negotiation system is completed, it should be reported to the League of Nations. The intention is nothing more than this, which can be said to be truly in line with my wishes. (Havas dispatch on the 23rd)

### On the Depreciation of the Japanese Yen in Shanghai

Recently, the value of the Japanese yen in the Shanghai market has plummeted. Ten days ago, the price of Chinese legal tender (fapi) and Japanese currency (yen) fluctuated slightly, almost on par. However, in the past three days, the lowest exchange rate for 100 yen could only buy 89 yuan of fapi. Furthermore, according to a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, this situation is not unusual, and it is likely to continue to develop. The Japanese yen currently circulating in the occupied areas of China is part of the Japanese-issued paper currency. The rapid decline in the price of this portion of the yen reveals the extent to which Japanese monetary inflation has reached!

China and Japan are at war. The value of the currencies of the two countries is a barometer of the economic situation of each country. Both countries have adopted foreign exchange control policies, each with its legal foreign exchange prices, and the prices are the same: each Japanese yen equals one shilling and two pence of British gold, and each fapi also equals one shilling and two pence of British gold. However, the foreign exchange prices of the Japanese yen flowing into the occupied areas of China in the markets of Shanghai, Tianjin, Hong Kong, etc., like fapi, are far from the government's legal standard. In June of last year, 100 yuan of fapi could be exchanged for slightly less than 95 yen. In December, it could be exchanged for 92 yen. At that time, the black market foreign exchange price of fapi was eight pence of British gold per yuan. Therefore, the foreign exchange price of the Japanese yen in the black market was indeed only between eight and nine pence per yen. The legal exchange rate of fapi was one shilling and two pence, while the black market price was eight pence. The Japanese side once used this as an excellent source of publicity to prove the weakness of the foundation of Chinese fapi; in fact, the real value of the Japanese yen was no better than fapi. Now, the price of fapi in the Shanghai black market still maintains the price of eight pence, while the exchange rate of the Japanese yen against fapi can only be 89 yuan of fapi for every 100 yen; this means that the foreign exchange price of the Japanese yen is only a little over seven pence. The occupied areas of China are under Japanese control. Japan can manipulate the Japanese yen and fapi as it pleases: Why can't Japan maintain its legal standard for the Japanese yen in the occupied areas and allow its price to be reduced to the level of the Chinese fapi? What does this barometer show?

The sharp drop in the price of the Japanese yen in Shanghai is by no means an accidental phenomenon, but the result of Japan's implementation of wartime economic policies. Since the start of the war against China, the source of military expenditure for Japan has almost entirely come from the issuance of public bonds and paper money. Among them, the issuance of paper money alone had increased by more than one billion yen by the end of last year. The scope of circulation of this huge amount of paper money is not only within Japan, but also extends to its various colonies. Recently, as the scope of Japan's war against China has gradually expanded, the required war expenses have also gradually increased, and the increase in the issuance of paper money has become an unavoidable fact. In March of this year, the Japanese government formally submitted a bill to the Diet, proposing to increase the issuance amount of the three banks of Japan, Taiwan, and Korea by 40 to 60 percent. Because of past currency inflation, the general public in Japan has felt extreme pain. Now, in order to maintain the stability of Japanese domestic society, it is inevitable that the increased paper money, that is, the phenomenon of monetary inflation, will be used as the tail end of the occupied areas of China, and thus be filled and depreciated.

In order to increase military expenditure, obtain various resources in the occupied areas of China, and establish the so-called "yen bloc" for trade with Japan, and at the same time avoid the adverse effects of Japanese yen inflation on the country, Japan adopted roundabout and indirect methods, such as instructing the issuance of so-called "United Reserve Notes" and military scrip. Unexpectedly, these kinds of "notes" and "scrip" could not compete with Chinese fapi. Recently, in order to take advantage of the current tense international situation, Japan has been shipping Japanese banknotes to China in various ways in an attempt to complete its "yen bloc" plan, which excludes the rights and interests of Europe and the United States in China. The recent surge in the Japanese yen in Shanghai is probably the reason for this; and the Japanese yen flowing into the occupied areas of China along with the Japanese army, whether Chinese or Japanese, do not dare to regard it as reliable property. After accepting the Japanese yen, they either immediately exchange it for fapi, or then use fapi to exchange China's foreign exchange. As a result, this kind of Japanese yen has gradually concentrated in Shanghai, and finally shocked the market price. The Japanese government seems to have anticipated this phenomenon. In recent weeks, the Japanese government has prohibited tourists from bringing Japanese yen to Japan, and it has also prohibited the use of Japanese currency to pay for the prices of goods shipped from Japan and the Northeast to Shanghai. This is to prevent the Japanese yen from depreciating and launching a counterattack on Japan. In addition, the so-called "United Reserve Notes" linked to the Japanese yen have recently been added to below 60 percent; the newly established China Development Bank is rumored to use Japanese yen and fapi to realize a large amount of Japanese yen on the market. Therefore, the current sharp drop in the price of the Japanese yen is a necessary result of various factors combined. The spokesman for the Japanese Embassy is definitely not an amateur.

Currently, the Japanese yen in China has become a malignant tumor in the Japanese economy. The "yen bloc" that Japan hoped for has indeed begun to be implemented; but the currencies in each bloc must have the same value; and now the foreign exchange value of the Japanese yen in Shanghai is only one-half of the foreign exchange value of the Japanese yen in Japan. If Japan does not do its best to support the value of the Japanese yen in China, but instead cuts off the connection between its domestic and foreign yen, then the dream of the so-called yen bloc will quickly disappear: But if she wants to vigorously support the price of the Japanese yen in China, can she set up a huge foreign exchange fund for the inflated Japanese yen in China? This is not only not allowed by Japan's current financial resources, but also more likely to accelerate the crisis of the collapse of its domestic monetary system.

### Transforming the Japanese Army's Rear into the Chinese Army's Front Line Achieved Successfully; Guerrilla Forces Can Not Only Fight in Mountainous Areas, but Also Use Plains as Bases; A Talk by Mr. Zhou Enlai

(Chongqing) This reporter recently met with Mr. Zhou Enlai, a leader of the Chinese Communist Party, who had just returned from inspecting the guerrilla areas in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. According to him, China's "transforming the Japanese army's rear into the Chinese army's front line" new strategy has achieved great results. After six months of the Japanese side's "encirclement campaign," not only has it failed to eliminate the Chinese guerrilla forces in its rear, but the number of these guerrilla forces has increased and their position has become more solid. The result of his trip is that he has broken the myth that guerrilla forces can only fight in mountainous areas. He visited a guerrilla base in a certain plains area in Jiangsu, the area of which spans a hundred *li* in length and fifty *li* in width. The Japanese army had built hundreds of blockhouses in that area, but still could not contain the activities of the guerrilla forces. Chinese guerrilla forces not only control areas outside major cities, but have also infiltrated major cities to carry out activities. Residents of a certain town held a mass rally one evening, swearing their loyalty to the central government. The town is only a stone's throw away from the office of the local puppet government, which is heavily guarded by Japanese soldiers. Mr. Zhou continued, the Chinese side can not only collect taxes from the people in the countryside as usual, but Chinese residents in major cities occupied by the Japanese also send representatives out from time to time to pay taxes to the Chinese authorities. After six months of the Japanese army's encirclement campaign, the guerrilla forces originally stationed in the Japanese army's rear still maintain a dominant position, and even more Chinese troops have entered the occupied areas. (24th Reuters Dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to General Zhou Enlai, Deputy Minister of the Political Department of the General Headquarters and representative of the Communist Party, today stated that "China's strategy is to use China's manpower and material resources to deal with Japan, so that Japan's strategy of conquering China cannot be realized." Japan has not changed its fundamental policy of conquering China, nor has it slightly changed its determination to eliminate foreign interests in China. According to Mr. Zhou, "Japan's new policy has the support of Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and Japanese financiers and bankers. The purpose of this policy is to "eliminate the Chinese resistance forces in the rear of the Japanese army, and at the same time, when the time is ripe, advance forward again." The Japanese army is currently engaged in "clearing" the rear, accounting for 85% of its total troops in China. Therefore, in the past two months, the Japanese army has only made two major battles, but the Japanese side's strategy has failed to achieve anything, because generally speaking, "the Chinese side has been able to maintain its existing positions, and at the same time has sent a large number of regular troops to the rear of the Japanese army to deal with the Japanese army. In short, the more effort the Japanese army makes to 'clear', the more regular troops China will send to the rear of the Japanese army. Our strategy is to launch guerrilla warfare in the rear of the Japanese army. Many foreigners believe that this tactic has not developed much to date, but in fact, there has been much progress to date. Our goal is to establish various combat bases in the rear of the Japanese army to consume the enemy's strength, and at the same time defeat the Japanese people's exploitation of Chinese resources to supplement the depletion of the Japanese economy. After the establishment of this guerrilla warfare military base, the Japanese army has been struggling to cope and is unable to advance forward, so we have greater freedom. This guerrilla warfare military base is not only established in mountainous areas, such as the Wutai Mountains in Shanxi Province, but also in the plains. For example, in the plain area near Wuhu, 25 English miles wide and 75 English miles long, it has fully contained the strength of one Japanese division. The Japanese army there has been forced to build countless fortresses around it. The Japanese army contained by the Wutai Mountains is as many as 50,000 people. The Japanese side has launched four sieges to date, but the results have all failed. On average, a small team of guerrilla forces can kill about 10 Japanese soldiers every day. If each district kills 100 Japanese soldiers per day, then if 100 such bases can be established, 360,000 Japanese soldiers can be killed every year." According to Mr. Zhou, Japan's plan to eliminate the rear has five points: (1) To impose an economic blockade on China; (2) To conduct an economic war against China; (3) To seize China's coal, iron, cotton, salt, tea, rice and other products in order to enrich Japan's resources and turn these raw materials into Japanese goods for dumping in China; (4) To develop the transportation money in North China; (5) To build ports. At the beginning of the war, Japan originally intended to blockade China, but to this day, it wants to engage in trade with China. At the beginning of the war, Japan originally intended to destroy all of China's industries, but to this day, they are trying to rebuild industries in China, because simply encouraging exports is quite unfavorable to Japan's international payments. As for Japan's plan to obtain raw materials in the occupied areas, it has also been very little successful. For example, the Japanese people originally planned to obtain 10 million tons of coal in North China, but the result was only 1 million tons. Furthermore, the question of economic development is fundamentally impossible, because this point must be able to militarily control the rear of the Japanese army before it is possible. Therefore, at first, it required 1.40 *yuan* of legal currency to exchange for 1 *yuan* of puppet currency, but to date, this exchange rate has been reversed. Furthermore, their plan to build ports has long been planned, but they have not yet started." Mr. Zhou continued to talk about China's program to deal with the Japanese plan, saying, "We admit that there are many weaknesses, such as not being able to carry out a thorough economic blockade against Japan, not being able to thoroughly boycott Japanese goods, and not being able to thoroughly destroy various factories before the fall, resulting in them falling into the hands of the enemy, and at the same time, Japanese goods can still flow into China." Mr. Zhou continued, "We must carry out a thorough blockade on the coastal areas, even if the people there feel inconvenienced, we do not care. Our goal is to make the Chinese people self-sufficient, so we must continue to carry out the work of destroying the fallen areas, allowing for the destruction of railways, highways, and various industries used by the Japanese. We have organized the majority of the people to destroy the Japanese army's transportation lines and maintain the work of Chinese resources in the rear of the Japanese army. At the same time, we must make the people in remote areas understand the significance of this resolution to resist Japan. The reason why the Japanese army has been able to achieve some achievements in China is mostly due to our own weaknesses, not entirely due to the strength of the Japanese army. For example, we have some troops that are not accustomed to guerrilla warfare, so they have not been able to fully accomplish the mission of attacking the Japanese. At the same time, the cooperation of the people has not been fully satisfactory, so the fall of many places is not so much due to the conquest of the Japanese army as it is due to our voluntary abandonment. As for now, the masses have been organized by us, and they have all enthusiastically engaged in breaking the Japanese people's plan to use Chinese manpower and resources to conquer China. Therefore, the anti-Japanese war in the rear of the Japanese army is a comprehensive war of organized people against the Japanese, not just the anti-resistance work of guerrilla forces. At the same time, on the front, we do not absolutely launch multi-faceted counterattacks against the Japanese when the Japanese advance in a certain direction. Furthermore, we do not stop training new troops in the rear in preparation for the final blow in order to achieve the final victory." Mr. Zhou also said, "In this new stage of the War of Resistance, the Japanese army can still win small victories, but there is absolutely no possibility of winning big victories. It is difficult to predict where the Japanese people will attack next, but what is known is that they will definitely attack where they can obtain the greatest benefits, that is, they will attack our weaknesses and unprepared places. For example, the recent battle of Nanchang is an example. In addition, the weaving roads and other transportation lines of the Chinese side are also in their sights of attack. In the future, the direction of the Japanese people's attack will change with the situation in Europe. If Britain and France have something to do in Europe, then the Japanese people will continue to advance to the southwest; otherwise, they will advance to the northwest." In short, their goal is to eliminate foreign interests in China. (23rd Associated Press Dispatch)

### Chamberlain Announces in Parliament that the Anglo-Soviet Agreement Can Be Established Immediately; New Proposals Based on Negotiations Have Been Submitted; Poland and Romania No Longer Object

(London) Regarding the organization of an anti-aggression group, Prime Minister Chamberlain replied to the inquiry of Major Attlee, leader of the opposition Labor Party, in the House of Commons this afternoon, saying, "When Foreign Minister Lord Halifax passed through Paris to Geneva the other day, he exchanged views with French Foreign Minister Bonnet, and then held talks with Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky in Geneva. The views of all parties were thus clarified. The British government immediately submitted new proposals to the Soviet government based on the results of these talks. I have reason to believe that the two countries, Britain and the Soviet Union, can establish an agreement in a short period of time based on these proposals. Although there are still several issues to be resolved, they will not cause major difficulties." Major Attlee also asked whether the Prime Minister could submit a more detailed report to the House of Commons before Pentecost. The Prime Minister then replied, "There are several points still to be resolved, as I have already informed you. Due to time constraints, it may be necessary to wait until after the holiday before a statement can be issued. It is also possible that the agreement will have been established by then, so that a detailed report can be submitted." (24th Havas Dispatch)

(London) Foreign Minister Halifax flew back to London from Paris at 9:40 this morning, arriving safely at Croydon Airport in the suburbs. He immediately paid a visit to Prime Minister Chamberlain to report on the details of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations in Geneva, which lasted 15 minutes before completion. The cabinet then held a cabinet meeting at 11:00 this morning to listen to the report of Foreign Minister Halifax and conduct a thorough discussion, which lasted two hours. According to government insiders, the agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has been agreed upon in Geneva, and the cabinet will approve it and reply to the Soviet Union in Geneva, confirming the contents of the note and taking into account the position of other related countries. (24th Havas)

(London) Government insiders recently stated that the situation regarding the negotiations between British and Soviet representatives in Geneva was still pessimistic this morning. It was not until the latest news from Geneva reached here late at night that the general public was relieved. Once the cabinet holds a cabinet meeting tomorrow, it will be able to approve the results of these negotiations and formally reply to the Soviet Union before Prime Minister Chamberlain returns to Beijing from Scotland, which will surely satisfy the Soviet government. (23rd Havas Dispatch)

(Paris) According to reliable French sources, British Foreign Minister Lord Halifax and Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky have reached a compromise in principle on the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union. Although it must be finally approved by the governments of Britain and the Soviet Union before it can become a reality, French officials are very satisfied upon hearing this news. It is said that the negotiations between the two sides have now reached the stage of formulating principles, that is, they have agreed on the constraints that Britain and the Soviet Union should accept from each other, just like France and the Soviet Union. It is said that the meeting between Foreign Minister Halifax and Maisky in Geneva can be regarded as a success, greatly enhancing world peace. Halifax has now returned to London from Geneva and will be able to arrive in time to participate in today's British cabinet meeting. Halifax will report at the meeting on the situation of his talks with French cabinet members and the Soviet ambassador. The British cabinet held a special meeting yesterday to clear up domestic affairs, so that today's meeting can focus on the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. (24th Reuters Dispatch)

(London) According to Reuters' sources in London's foreign community, Poland and Romania have agreed to expand the scope of their existing mutual assistance agreements against the Soviet Union to include other aspects of attack. It is heard that the staff officers of both sides have held talks in Warsaw to resolve various technical issues related to this cooperation. It is said that both Poland and Romania have a very good attitude towards concluding any alliance with Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, as long as the agreement they sign with the Soviet Union is free from traces that could be regarded as hostile to Germany. As for Poland, the government regards its relationship with the Soviet Union as fully included in the 1932 Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, but in times of war, obtaining military supplies from the Soviet Union and relying on transportation in Soviet territory will require separate compromises. (24th Reuters Dispatch)

(Paris) Regarding the situation of the meeting between Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu and Yugoslav Foreign Minister Marković on a boat trip on the Danube River the other day, well-informed sources here recently received a report, learning that the German government had told Romania and Yugoslavia that the agreement concluded between Britain and Turkey put the two countries, Yugoslavia and Romania, in danger and that they should immediately abolish the Balkan consultation of the public in order to cope with the situation. This was reportedly rejected in the respective countries. The Romanian authorities have dispatched Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Cleceanu to Geneva to inform British Foreign Minister Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet that Romania has no objection to the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Although Yugoslavia is in a difficult situation due to being sandwiched between Germany, Italy, and Hungary, and Prince Paul, the first regent of the country, is also very suspicious of the Soviet Union, he also agrees to the conclusion of an agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. All of these can be cited as a reason for happiness. (24th Havas Dispatch)

### Rhine River Floods; German Defense Line Outpost Trapped in the Center of the Water

(Strasbourg, France) The Rhine River has been rising sharply for days and reached its peak today, overflowing the banks. The French Maginot Line on the left bank is located on higher ground and has not been affected. The German Siegfried Line on the right bank is in a low-lying area, and the outpost has been in the center of the water. All soldiers have quickly withdrawn. It is expected that the river water will gradually recede from tomorrow. (23rd Havas Dispatch)

### Japanese Forces Invade the Philippine Islands; US Senator Calls for Investigation

(Washington) Democratic member Arundell delivered a speech in the National Congress yesterday, requesting an appropriation to investigate the invasion of the Philippine Islands by the Japanese. He claimed that the United States may go to war with Japan in two years because of the Philippine Islands. He said that the United States was almost ready to join the war because of the Japanese invasion of China, but our people do not know that Japan is carrying out the same invasion in the Philippines in terms of business and government activities. Arundell speculated that Japan will attack the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines after occupying China. He also said that Congress should adopt his suggestions to draw the attention of the American people to the possibility that the United States may be involved in the Far East war. Arundell said that if the "investigation" is implemented, it will prevent "startling facts" from happening. The United States must decide whether it is unwilling to succumb to the Japanese invasion of the Philippine Islands, or whether it should immediately seek remedies. If we still want to maintain our position in the Philippine Islands, we must immediately engage in remediation work. We must prevent internal rebellions from occurring among the Japanese in the Philippines, pro-Japanese, and anti-Philippine officials. Finally, Arundell severely criticized Quezon.

### Danzig Dispute; City Council Replies to Poland

(Danzig) The Danzig Free City Council sent two notes to the Polish representative in Danzig today, replying to the protest lodged by the Polish government last Sunday regarding the Kaderhoff incident that occurred in Danzig. It is said that after investigating the incident, the Danzig City Council believes that the Polish side's wording does not fully conform to the facts, but cannot accept Poland's request. The Danzig government further requested the Polish government to recall the Polish embassy counselor Paulkowsky, tax inspector Schweda, and another official named Schiller who was involved in the Kaderhoff incident. It is said that the Danzig government will no longer be able to contact the above-mentioned persons and asks for their replacement. (24th Haitong Dispatch)

(Warsaw) A minor dispute occurred in the town of Dirschau, located at the border between Poland and the Free City of Danzig, in the evening. A German heavy truck drove from East Prussia to Dirschau. The driver was originally supposed to get out of the car and complete the procedures at the Polish checkpoint before driving into Danzig, but he did not follow the usual practice and walked around the border for a long time. A border guard ordered him to leave, but the driver did not comply. The border guard immediately fired two shots into the air, and the driver then went to complete the procedures and entered the city of Danzig. He returned to East Prussia along the same route at 7:00 this morning. There were no other disputes. (24th Havas News Agency Dispatch)

### Fortification Plan for the Åland Islands; League of Nations Postpones Discussion; Due to Soviet Opposition; Soviet Union Wants Finland to Provide Information

(Geneva) The fortification of the Åland Islands has not been resolved due to the opposition of the Soviet representative. According to League of Nations sources, the reason for the Soviet representative's opposition is that after the island is fortified, it will sooner or later become a German naval base, and the Finnish army has always been pro-German. Once a war breaks out, they will automatically cede the island to Germany. It is said that the Soviet representative has requested the League of Nations to postpone the discussion of the island's fortification until the next regular meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council in the autumn. (24th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

(Moscow) An announcement was recently published here stating that the Finnish government recently applied to the Soviet government for assistance, hoping to revise the 1921 treaty. According to the treaty, the Åland Islands shall not be fortified and should be neutralized. This treaty was signed by 22 countries. Although the Soviet Union is not one of the signatory countries, it has always paid special attention to it. Now Finland is attempting to revise the treaty and jointly fortify the Åland Islands with Sweden. Therefore, the Soviet government has requested materials on the nature and extent of the proposed fortification plan for the islands through the Finnish ambassador to the Soviet Union. This point is extremely important to the Soviet Union, as the Åland Islands are located at the mouth of the Gulf of Finland, and their fortifications can be used in wartime to block the exit of the Gulf, preventing Soviet ships from entering and leaving. Because the proposal to fortify the Åland Islands has not yet been established, and the Finnish government is unwilling to provide materials on the nature and extent of these fortifications, the Soviet government believes that under these conditions, it is not possible to obtain the necessary materials to resolve the above-mentioned issues. It has instructed its representative attending the League of Nations to firmly advocate that the League of Nations Administrative Council should postpone the discussion of the issue at the present time. (24th TASS News Agency Dispatch)

(Helsinki, Finland) Finnish Foreign Minister Erkko recently made a statement saying that regarding the fortification of the Åland Islands, the Finnish government will refuse to answer the questions raised by the Soviet government regarding the scope of the fortification. Although the Åland Treaty stipulates that if Finland and Sweden want to carry out fortification on the island, they must first obtain the consent of the Soviet Union before it can be implemented, this is a matter of military secrets, which independent and autonomous countries are unwilling to answer. (24th Haitong Dispatch)

(Stockholm, Sweden) People here were greatly surprised to hear that the Soviet representative requested the League of Nations to postpone the decision on the fortification of the Åland Islands. People in Sweden believe that this move by the Soviet Union is hindering Sweden's military plans. Newspapers generally believe that the Soviet Union's adoption of this attitude is due to the Anglo-Soviet negotiations. *Social Democratic Newspaper* commented that the Soviet Union took the opportunity of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations to propose a ban on the fortification of the island, which is inevitably suspected of blackmailing democratic countries. *Swedish Daily News* commented that regardless of the attitude adopted by the Soviet government, the fortification of the island will continue to proceed. (24th Haitong Dispatch)

### British Parliament Discusses the Czech Question

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that the British Chargé d'Affaires in Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is scheduled to return home on the 25th of this month. The interests held by Britain in the Czech Republic will be temporarily taken care of by a Vice-Consul. "Whether the British government will send another person to reside in the Czech capital, and whether future actions will be sufficient to raise the issue of recognizing the new state of the Czech Republic, are under consideration by the government. It is hoped that there will be a statement on this matter in the short term." Several members of Parliament then asked questions one after another. Prime Minister Chamberlain then replied, "Regarding this topic, apart from what has been said just now, I am not prepared to say anything more. Our country has recently conducted informal talks with Germany, but this does not mean that we recognize the change in the system of Bohemia and Moravia in fact. This question and the question of whether Britain will send another representative to reside in Prague are being considered by the government at the same time." Conservative member Sandys then rose to speak, requesting the Prime Minister to provide a guarantee, stating that regarding the affairs of Bohemia and Moravia, even if recognition is intended, the opinion of the House of Commons must be sought first. Prime Minister Chamberlain then replied, "This guarantee is not easy to provide." Labor member Attlee then asked, "Does the Prime Minister's statement imply that the government has the intention to recognize it?" The Prime Minister replied, "No, I am not saying that."

### Queen Mother of England Injured in Car Accident - 72nd Birthday Celebrations Canceled

(London) Following Queen Mary's car accident in the countryside yesterday, ophthalmologist Sir Cross visited Marlborough House this morning for an examination lasting one hour before departing. The Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Kent also visited the palace. At noon, an official statement was released: "The Queen Mother sustained an eye injury and feels some pain, causing a restless night. However, her overall condition is good and not a cause for concern." The palace staff has telegraphed King George VI and Queen Elizabeth regarding the Queen Mother's injury. The court had originally planned a banquet tomorrow to celebrate the Queen Mother's seventy-second birthday on the 26th of this month, but this has now been canceled. (Havas dispatch, 24th)

(London) After Queen Mary's near-fatal car accident in Wimbledon yesterday afternoon, all social engagements for the coming days have been canceled. She will not be joining the royal family at the Epsom races today. An eyewitness stated that the Queen Mother's vehicle collided with a truck. According to a diagnosis issued by two royal physicians from Marlborough House, the Queen Mother's car overturned, causing injury and shock. Although the Queen Mother sustained multiple injuries and requires several days of complete rest, her condition is satisfactory. The palace stated that there is no cause for concern, but the physicians want the Queen Mother to rest completely for twelve hours before speaking. When this news reached Canada, the royal train was stopped so that the accident and the Queen Mother's condition could be reported to the King and Queen. The accident occurred at the intersection of Wimbledon Park Road and West Hill Road as the Queen Mother, accompanied by her treasurer Lord Hamilton and Mrs. Gaskell, was returning from the Royal Horticultural Society Gardens to Marlborough House. Lord Hamilton suffered a cut hand, and Mrs. Gaskell sustained a bruised arm. Witnesses at the scene said that the Queen Mother remained very calm. Those who helped the Queen Mother out of the car said that she smiled and made jokes about the accident. After the accident, the Queen Mother was taken to a nearby doctor's surgery. Inside, the Queen Mother said, "All I need is a cup of tea." After resting for a moment, the Queen Mother left in another royal car. When the accident occurred, a painter working nearby rushed to the overturned car and used a ladder to help the Queen Mother out. As the Queen Mother left the doctor's residence, a large crowd outside recognized her and cheered. The Queen Mother, although shaken, smiled and nodded to the crowd in thanks.

### US Submarine Sinks - 26 Out of 62 Crew Members Confirmed Dead

(New York) According to senior naval personnel in Portsmouth, it is now believed that 26 of the 62 crew members of the US submarine Squalus, which sank near the Isle of Shoals off the coast of New Hampshire, have died. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

(Portsmouth, New Hampshire) The US submarine Squalus, carrying 62 people, is reported to have sunk five miles southeast of the Isle of Shoals off the coast of New Hampshire. The submarine made a routine dive at 9:20 AM yesterday. One hour later, it had not resurfaced. In such circumstances, dives usually last for one hour. The submarine is now in 240 feet of water. The submarine Sculpin, ordered to the scene, was unable to communicate with the Squalus by telephone. It is reported that the Squalus failed to close the induction valve during its rapid dive, causing water to enter the crew compartments. The engine room is also said to be flooded. The naval tug Wandank, the cruiser Brooklyn, the submarine rescue ship Falcon, a Coast Guard aircraft, and two patrol boats have all been ordered to assist in the rescue. Naval personnel state that the Squalus is equipped with all the latest safety equipment and can sustain life for 24 hours. The authorities also state that they will attempt to send a diver from a surface vessel to close the induction valve. If successful, the submarine can be refloated. The Squalus has four or five waterproof compartments that can keep water out. The Portsmouth command claims that the submarine's oxygen tanks can support the crew for a week. Further report: The US submarine Squalus, which sank off the Isle of Shoals, was contacted by the submarine Sculpin late yesterday, which rushed to the scene. There is now encouraging news that all 62 crew members of the Squalus are safe and well. This information was relayed via a floatation telephone. It was reported, "All crew are safe." There has been no further communication from the sunken submarine. The Sculpin is now preparing to send a diver to attempt to close the Squalus's induction valve. Once this is done, the submarine is expected to surface. The sea is calm today, and it is believed to be possible to dive. President Roosevelt told reporters in Washington that he is confident that the crew of the Squalus can be rescued. The government is sending all possible equipment and personnel to the scene and is listening for developments via naval wireless. President Roosevelt added that the submarines have what are known as "lungs," which the crew can use to escape to the surface, but this will not be used unless absolutely necessary. Everyone believes that it is safer to attempt to refloat the entire submarine. If a diver can close the submarine's open valve and connect a compressed air pipe to the submarine, filling it with air, the submarine will refloat. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

### British Mail Ship "Rampur" Forcibly Inspected by Japanese Soldiers - British Warship Sent to Assist, Japanese Soldiers Withdraw - Naval Authorities Lodge Protest

(Hong Kong) A Japanese warship dispatched a team of soldiers to board the British company mail ship Rampur (16,688 tons) near Hong Kong today. British naval authorities have dispatched a destroyer to the scene. According to information received by the British naval authorities, Japanese sailors boarded the Rampur at 8:30 AM this morning near Waglan Island Lighthouse outside Hong Kong. Upon receiving the information, the British naval command sent a wireless message to the British destroyer Duchess (1,375 tons), which was conducting exercises nearby, ordering the captain to assist the mail ship. According to another report, Japanese soldiers did board the Rampur to inspect the ship's manifest. Upon the arrival of the Duchess, the Japanese soldiers were ordered to disembark. A Japanese cruiser flying the flag of a rear admiral was nearby. The Rampur had departed from London bound for Hong Kong, carrying Rear Admiral Murray, the newly appointed commander of the 5th Cruiser Squadron, who was traveling to take up his post. It has been common for Japanese soldiers to board small British merchant ships along the coast and inland rivers for inspection, but this is the first time they have boarded a major British ocean liner. According to passengers on the Rampur, a Japanese destroyer fired two shots across the ship's bow from half a mile away and then signaled the mail ship to stop. However, the ship's captain ignored the signal and continued at full speed, hoping to reach British territorial waters one mile away. The Japanese destroyer gave chase. Seeing the situation, the mail ship stopped. Three Japanese officers then boarded the ship and demanded to see the manifest. The captain's protests were to no avail. The officers remained on board for twenty minutes until the Duchess arrived, at which point they reluctantly disembarked. The mail ship then resumed its course towards Hong Kong. Passengers also stated that even after the ship had entered British territorial waters, a Japanese aircraft circled overhead. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

(Hong Kong) The British merchant ship Rampur, sailing from Singapore to Hong Kong, was ordered to stop by a Japanese destroyer at 8:00 AM on the 24th when it reached the waters four miles southwest of Waglan Island. The Japanese then sent personnel to board and inspect the ship, causing considerable disruption. The ship's owner immediately reported this to the naval authorities in Hong Kong. Upon receiving the report, the authorities dispatched the HMS Duchess to the scene to assist. The British ship was then able to reach Hong Kong. It is reported that the British naval authorities have lodged a strong protest with the Japanese side. It is also reported that a Japanese cruiser flying the flag of a vice admiral was also present, monitoring the situation. Rear Admiral Murray, the newly appointed deputy commander of the 5th British Cruiser Squadron, happened to be on board the ship, arriving in Hong Kong to take up his new post. (Dispatch, 24th)

(London) Conservative MP Mr. Chater asked in the House of Commons today about the detention of the British ship Sagres by the Japanese. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that the Chinese crew of the ship had been mistreated by the Japanese in an attempt to extract confessions, but without success. The British government will reserve the right to seek compensation. Mr. Chater added that Britain has great power in the Mediterranean and Atlantic, would it not be a powerful warning to Japan if Britain detained some Japanese ships in these two areas? The Prime Minister replied, "I don't think that such a situation is entirely satisfactory." (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

### Dutch Princess Visits Belgium - Promotes Bilateral Relations

### Situation Deteriorates Among the Naval Authorities of Four Countries in Kulangsu - Communication Between Kulangsu and Fujian Province Cut Off by the Japanese Navy - Japan Claims Right to Take Action in the Concessions

(Hong Kong) According to Japanese sources in Xiamen, the talks among the naval authorities of the four countries in Kulangsu, which began on the 22nd, continued yesterday on board the flagship HMS Birmingham (9,000 tons) of the British China Fleet. No official statement has been released regarding the progress of the talks. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers continue to prominently publish reports on the "delicate situation" in Kulangsu. It is reported that the naval authorities of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Japan have held a meeting on board the British cruiser Birmingham. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the Japanese naval authorities have decided to cut off communication between Kulangsu and Fujian Province, preventing the island from interacting with areas outside Xiamen. If Japan's "reasonable demands" are rejected by the powers, and if the powers threaten Japan with joint action, Japan will not yield a single step but will push forward its policy without hesitation. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

(Xiamen) The Japanese Consul-General in Kulangsu, Mr. Uchida, notified the Kulangsu International Settlement Municipal Council yesterday, requesting that it recognize the Xiamen Security Maintenance Committee as the local Chinese authority and re-submitted the previous five demands: (1) Strictly suppress anti-Japanese propaganda and terrorist acts; (2) The Director-General, Chief of Police, and Director of the Municipal Council should be Japanese, and the number of Japanese police officers should be increased; (3) Taiwanese should be allowed to vote and be elected as directors of the Municipal Council; (4) Three Chinese members should be appointed by the Chairman of the Xiamen Security Maintenance Committee to fill the vacant positions of Chinese directors of the Municipal Council; (5) Japanese police should have the right to jointly search and arrest anti-Japanese elements with the Municipal Council police. The Japanese notification also stated that Kulangsu is a part of Xiamen, so the Kulangsu Municipal Council must be reorganized to adapt to the new situation in Xiamen. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

(Hong Kong) According to Japanese sources received here, the talks among the four powers in Kulangsu have now deteriorated. Since 6:00 PM on Tuesday, Chinese vessels have been prohibited from traveling between Kulangsu and the mainland, which is tantamount to a blockade of the Kulangsu International Settlement. Japanese Consul-General Uchida has notified the Kulangsu Municipal Council of this matter today. According to British authorities, the talks have not broken down and are still ongoing on board HMS Birmingham. Meanwhile, the French flagship Picardie, along with a destroyer, has arrived in Xiamen. Therefore, there are now ten foreign ships outside Xiamen, excluding Japanese ships. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)

(Hong Kong) Several days ago, various parties were optimistic about the future of the Kulangsu incident, believing that it could be resolved soon. However, according to unofficial sources today, Japan is currently working hard to persuade the US and UK authorities to accept the recommendation of appointing three Japanese to key positions in the Kulangsu Municipal Council, so the resolution of the Kulangsu issue is still fraught with difficulties. It is understood that British China Fleet Commander Admiral Noble insists that the four-power conference should not mention other matters besides discussing the withdrawal of the landed naval forces. Due to the stalemate in negotiations, Japanese reports claim that the Japanese navy has completely blockaded Kulangsu, allowing only vessels controlled by the Japanese to sail to Xiamen. A Japanese cruiser is stationed between Kulangsu and Xiamen, while Japanese patrols patrol the sea, allowing only vessels under Japanese control to enter and exit. (Associated Press dispatch, 24th)

(Tokyo) According to Xiamen news received by Japanese newspapers, the Japanese navy has completely cut off communication between Kulangsu and the outside world. Ship traffic between Kulangsu and the mainland has been blocked. The Kulangsu Municipal Council previously prohibited Chinese vessels from traveling between Kulangsu and the mainland at Japan's request, but anti-Japanese Chinese still crossed secretly at night or on foreign vessels. In order to completely prevent Chinese from traveling, a Japanese warship arrived in Kulangsu on Tuesday and is now docked between Kulangsu and Xiamen in order to prevent Chinese and foreign vessels from traveling.

### Palestine Issue - British Parliament Passes White Paper - Opposition Amendment Rejected

(London) Although the solution to the Palestine issue contained in the White Paper faced strong opposition in the House of Commons today, it was ultimately passed by 268 votes to 179, and the opposition's amendment was rejected by 281 votes to 181. Dominion Minister Inskip replied to the arguments of the opposition members, saying that the White Paper not only fulfills the mandate but also fulfills the Balfour Declaration. The government has no intention of abandoning the Jews it has invited. The House can protect the Jews from such atrocities. The government does not intend to give the Arabs the power to oppose the establishment of a Jewish national home. The mandate does not force Britain to permanently resettle Jews in Palestine, nor does it endorse the theory that Palestine should become a Jewish state. The purpose of the government's proposal is to give the Jewish and Arab communities the opportunity to develop Palestine together and live in peace. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)

(London) During the debate on the government's White Paper in the House of Lords today, the government's motion was passed. Lord Snell put forward an amendment to it, the content of which was the same as the motion put forward by the Labour Party in the House of Commons. In the House of Lords today, the speeches of former Palestine High Commissioner Lord Samuel and the Archbishop of Canterbury were the most noteworthy. Lord Samuel first mentioned many of the arguments made by speakers during yesterday's debate in the House of Commons, and said that in his personal opinion, it was a mistake to try to establish a policy for five or ten years from now. Lord Samuel also mentioned the possibility of establishing a federation in conjunction with the Arab states and guaranteeing an autonomous Jewish state with full powers. Lord Samuel criticized the government's proposals on immigration, saying that the ideal of a Jewish national home had clearly been curtailed. The Archbishop of Canterbury expressed the opinion that the White Paper gave the Jews very little justice. Secretary of State for India and Burma Lord Zetland replied on behalf of the government, saying that he believed the Jewish national home was a spiritual quality, represented by the Hebrew University and other organizations, or would promote the arts of Jewish canon, and that Jewish rites could be practiced in all holy places. The British government has strived to build this national home for the Jews. The government has indeed promised to recognize and support the declaration of independence by the Arabs in most Arab countries, and believes that it has fulfilled this promise, as evidenced by Iraq and other countries, but Palestine is not included in this promise.

### Recent Developments in Europe: A Perspective on World Destiny and the Future of the Far East - European Correspondence

For the three years since the formation of the German-Japanese-Italian aggressor group, especially the two years since China began its war of resistance, we can confidently summarize that the direction of the world's destiny and the future of the Far East has been consistent and unchanged. What is the only event that could potentially change this direction, the only endeavor to forge a new history? Without a doubt, it is the "policy" of the current British "Chamberlain Cabinet" that formally appeared on the world stage since last spring. However, this policy was already declared a complete failure by the eve of Prime Minister Chamberlain's famous "Birmingham Speech" at the beginning of this year. Subsequently, when the British government decided to start negotiations with the Soviet Union, the current British cabinet had essentially gone around a large circle, only to return to its original starting point. The most interesting thing is that the group of people in charge of this circling has remained unchanged from beginning to end. What makes us feel uneasy is the thought of the numerous small nations and countries - Austria, Czechoslovakia, Spain, Albania - that were sacrificed as a result. Therefore, when the British government turned around and successively offered guarantees of independence to small countries in Eastern and Southern Europe, it was essentially saying: from now on, British diplomacy has returned to its starting point of a year ago, and is restarting on the right path.

Whether this second start will stray onto a wrong path again is something we still dare not say for certain. However, there is another point that we can predict with certainty: if the first attempt yielded nothing but sacrifice, then even a second attempt would inevitably result in a complete failure. The only difference is that if, unfortunately, there is indeed a second attempt, then the sacrifice will be much greater than the first. And after this decision, whether Britain will still have the opportunity to return to its original starting point and try again becomes highly questionable. Summarizing the evolution of the past year, even now, we can say that the steadfastness of the Soviet Union and the United States, coupled with the great struggle of China, are the three pillars supporting the overall global situation over the past year. It is because of these pillars that Britain and France still have the opportunity to find new paths and salvage the fate of their empires. Otherwise, the disintegration of the British and French empires would probably have already become a reality, and it would be difficult to say otherwise.

For the past year, the British Chamberlain cabinet has essentially been playing games with the fate of its entire empire. However, even now, Prime Minister Chamberlain is still stubbornly insisting that his policy was not wrong. This is indeed as the British "Evening Standard" said: "Old people are always stubborn and unwilling to admit defeat." When hearing this kind of stubborn insistence, any sensible Briton would probably be unable to suppress a wry smile.

Of course, according to the current overall global situation, the first major event is:

(1) The ongoing cooperation negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union.

First of all, there is the issue of the foundation of this cooperation. The so-called antagonism between Britain and the Soviet Union has been common knowledge for years. Now that cooperation is being mentioned, what is its foundation? First, since the Soviet Union abandoned the "world revolution" policy, the transformation of social systems has largely become the internal affair of each country; second, after Britain's intervention in the Soviet social revolution failed, it has adopted an enlightened policy not only towards the Soviet Union, but also towards its own socialist tendencies and parties; third, the threat posed by the aggressor group of Germany, Japan, and Italy is a common one for Britain and the Soviet Union. In response to this foundation, cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union can be established under the framework of an "anti-aggression front" or a "peace front."

However, besides this, there is also a very important point, which is the subjective awareness and determination of both Britain and the Soviet Union. In this regard, there is a crucial difference at present: in order to maintain its current imperial content and scope, Britain is using any means to avoid war; because of this, it always attempts to shift the task of warfare onto others, allowing them to exhaust each other, so that they completely lose the threat to the British Empire. As for the Soviet Union, its consistent foreign policy in recent years has been to avoid provoking the formation of a fascist anti-communist crusade. However, on the other hand, in order to completely eliminate the threat to the only socialist country, it is ready to join hands with any large-scale international anti-aggression group and fight together at any time and place. In short, the so-called "resistance to aggression" that the British government has been advocating until today is, in fact, the preservation of the status quo through temporary ease; while the Soviet Union's so-called peace policy is fundamentally preparing for war at any time. Although the concrete establishment of British-Russian cooperation does not necessarily lead to war, before it is established, there must be at least such a minimum understanding between Britain and Russia as a major premise: the ultimate goal of cooperation is to maintain peace; however, when peaceful means of restraint are ineffective, they must have the automatic determination to fight at all costs. From this, the inevitable deduction is: (1) Britain abandons the illusion of breaking up the German-Japanese-Italian group; and (2) abandons the only secret to satisfying aggressor countries and avoiding major wars by sacrificing small national states; and (3) this spirit of cooperative resistance must be thoroughly popularized throughout the world, with Britain first abandoning the speculative nature of only caring about its own interests.

The fundamental awareness described above is not yet mature in the current situation in Britain; however, the general trend is indeed moving towards maturity.

Now, we want to discuss the specific progress of the cooperation negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union over the past two months. Generally speaking, it can be divided into three stages: after the fall of Czechoslovakia, the British and French authorities immediately began contacting the Soviet Union, expressing their willingness to jointly resist further aggression; the Soviet Union's response was the rather vague so-called reconstruction of "collective security," which was the first step. To be honest, the Soviet Union at that time was skeptical of the sincerity of Britain and France. Then, Romania and Poland were threatened. In order to show sincerity, Britain first guaranteed the independence of Poland and Romania. When Britain and France turned to the Soviet Union again to seek cooperation in Europe, the Soviet Union put forward more specific suggestions, that is, this cooperation should include the Far East, which was the second stage. At this time, President Roosevelt came forward, and at the same time, the US Navy was transferred back to the Pacific; as a result, Britain's illusion of separating Japan from the aggressor group was raised again. The British ambassador to Japan became unusually active. Negotiations with the Soviet Union temporarily entered a state of suspension. However, soon, Hitler's speech abolished the German-Polish non-aggression treaty and the British-German naval agreement, and thus the situation in Europe became tense again, and the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union entered the third stage. At this point, Britain's focus was no longer on cooperation, but only on asking: (1) if Britain and France were drawn into war in order to fulfill their guarantees to Romania, Poland, and other countries, would Soviet Russia help? (2) Could the Soviet Union provide the same guarantee to Romania, Poland, and other countries? The Soviet Union's answer was: (1) there should be a more definitive mutual assistance agreement between the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and Poland, (2) the scope of the guarantee should be popularized in Eastern Europe from the northernmost countries all the way to the Balkans, and in the West, countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland should also be included.

### Shantou and Southeast Asia: Economic Connections and Wartime Coping Strategies Are Fully Prepared

Shantou Correspondence: The situation in Chao-Shan is tense, and war seems unavoidable. Once the Japanese army invades, the positions along the coastline will have to be abandoned at any time. As Shantou is a flat delta, it is not a place for decisive battles and is therefore not easy to maintain intact. However, the people of Chao-Mei who go to Southeast Asia to make a living all regard Shantou as the hub. Last year, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia remitted 600,000 to 700,000 yuan to Shantou, which was then transferred to rural areas in various counties to support the families of overseas Chinese. The people's living expenses and the prosperity of commerce and industry depend on this. Since Shantou's position has this relationship, in case the Chao-Shan coast falls, the Chao-Shan hinterland will inevitably be isolated from Southeast Asia. I have heard that the authorities have already prepared remedial measures, which are recorded as follows:

Adjusting Postal Routes

The post office has sent key personnel to Hong Kong to establish a special office for adjusting postal routes. All letters transferred from various parts of Southeast Asia to the hinterland of Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Guangdong will never be allowed to pass through the occupied areas and be intercepted and inspected by the Japanese puppet forces. After the fall of Guangzhou and Xiamen, inland letters were still sent as usual, which can be clearly proven. Even if the Chao-Shan coast is occupied, letters sent to Meixian and Xingning counties will of course also be delivered by any means.

Active Remittances

National banks in Southeast Asia, Shanghai, and Hong Kong have already established connections with major British and American banks, greatly enhancing their credit. At the same time, they have also established connections with various stores, remittance agencies, and wholesale bureaus to reduce remittance fees and serve overseas Chinese. Outlying branches of national banks can absorb billions of yuan of foreign exchange funds each year (such as the Guangdong Provincial Bank's Hong Kong branch, which made a profit of more than 2 million yuan last year). They can also stimulate rural finance in the hinterland. For example, if a business collects private remittances, the business will deposit the money in the Hong Kong Provincial Bank, and in the hinterland, it can withdraw cash from the Provincial Bank's branch at any time and exchange it to various stores to be delivered to the families of the remitters.

War Zone Finance

The wartime financial sector will generally be handled according to the central government's method. For example, the Central, China, Communications, Provincial, Guangdong, Overseas Chinese, and Farmers banks in Chao-Shan will transfer their accounting books and banknotes to safe areas in advance. Bank staff will retreat into the mountains with the military and government agencies after the outbreak of war. The same will be done in various counties and cities. Post offices, telegram offices, banks, and business houses will also retreat together. At that time, two types of exchange methods can be divided into war zones and guerrilla zones.

Pocket Banks

Since the military's needs became independent, the authorities have set up pocket banks in the war zone, which store large amounts of banknotes and can fully supply military and government expenses every month. After industry and commerce retreat to the rear of the war zone, there is a separate system. The mobile bank counters that operate in the guerrilla zone consist of a team of three people: one bookkeeper, one treasurer, and one cashier. For example, if the war were to shift to Chao'an and Shantou became the enemy's rear, people who did not have time to escape and various groups could have remittances sent by the main branch office to be issued by the mobile bank counter. This bank counter is armed and moves frequently. Pocket banks are set up in the towns and suburbs near Chao'an, and the focus is still on mobile finance.

Recruiting Staff

Currently, the Provincial Bank and the Salt Administration are recruiting a large number of accountants and clerks, all of which are designed to adapt to the mobile nature of wartime. Young people with a high school diploma who have worked in stores for more than two years are eligible to apply. In short, no matter how far the war expands in the future, remittances from overseas Chinese back to the mainland will not be hindered. If postal mail is delayed, telegraphic transfers can also be used. In the future, banks will definitely reduce remittance fees to facilitate the flow of finance.

### Hong Kong's Defense Forces Are Adequate and Prepared for Future Three-Dimensional Warfare - Air Force Has Established Contact with Australia - Interview with a Foreign Military Observer

Hong Kong Correspondence: Hong Kong's defensive works have been intensified over the past two years and are now largely complete. Their strength is extremely solid. Yesterday, a foreign military observer spoke about Hong Kong's defensive works, believing them to be firm, unbreakable, and essentially as follows:

New Coastal Artillery - Superior Range

Hong Kong's defense line has always focused its efforts on the fortresses along the coast. The eastern sea passage has seen the installation of the latest type of heavy artillery in various gun emplacements over the past twelve months. Their range can reach more than twelve miles. The main artillery is equipped with pointing instruments. This new type of pointing instrument uses radio waves to rotate and can measure the speed and position of enemy ships, indicating where the muzzle should be aimed. It has been found that after each firing of a heavy gun, the smoke is very thick, making it easy for the enemy to discover the gun position. The newly installed heavy artillery is equipped with a smoke suppression device. The important gun emplacements in the eastern sea passage include Lei Yue Mun, Cape Collinson, and D'Aguilar Point. The range of the artillery can cover the Hong Kong fleet operating several miles beyond the Henglan Lighthouse.

Machine Gun Positions - Appropriately Deployed

The only fortress to defend against enemy ships invading from the south is the Stanley Fort. From Stanley, heading west along the coast, past Repulse Bay and Deep Water Bay to Aberdeen and all the way to Mount Davis, gun emplacements have been built on the mountainside. Driving through them, one can see their shape. The diameter of the artillery ranges from six to eight inches, but the firepower of the artillery in Stanley exceeds that of all other gun emplacements. Every certain distance between the gun emplacements, there are machine gun positions, with the distance being as far as the range of the machine guns in the two locations. The advantage of this type of position is that the firepower is interwoven into a dense fire net. The Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps' machine gun company often practices on this defense line. If Hong Kong enters a state of emergency in the future, the importance of this line is to defend against enemy ships landing on the south coast of Hong Kong, which is just as important as the Stanley Fort. Equally important as the Stanley Fort is the Mount Davis Fort, which controls the entrances to the western Lamma Channel and Kap Shui Mun. This fort has been very busy with recent exercises. Military construction on Lantau Island and Castle Peak is actively underway.

New Territories Defense Line - Extremely Important

The military observer stated that the defense lines of the New Territories, Tai Wo Market, and Tide Cove are all important locations. During the military exercises held in Hong Kong last year, they were once thought to be the enemy's attack locations. However, the observer believed that due to the changes in the situation, the targets of the defensive works in the New Territories often change accordingly. It is likely that the military authorities have attached great importance to this line this year. It is heard that this line is defended by the regular troops stationed in Hong Kong, and in the event of an incident, they will hold out for a very long time, giving the reinforcements ample time to arrive.

Australian Liaison - Ample Squadrons

The observer also talked about the strength of the Hong Kong Air Force and Navy, saying that in addition to the small number of aircraft permanently stationed on the island, there is also an aircraft carrier with more than 30 aircraft. However, the Hong Kong air defense has close ties with Australia. In wartime, Australia can supply Hong Kong with up to 100 aircraft per month, which is enough to meet wartime needs, he said.

### Jiangsu Province Relief Association Established - Han Deqin Concurrent Chairman

Taixian Correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Relief Branch and the Refugee Relief Committee during the Extraordinary Period have been reorganized into the Provincial Relief Association in accordance with the organizational regulations of the Provincial Relief Associations promulgated by the Central Government. The members of the association have also been appointed separately. In addition to Chairman Han serving concurrently as the acting chairman, and the members of the Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Department serving as ex officio members, prominent figures from various public organizations in the province and gentrymen enthusiastic about relief work have been appointed as members of the association, including Zhang Yipeng, Yan Huiqing, Wen Lanting, Han Guojun, Du Yuesheng, Wu Yunzhai, Nanguan Liao Zhaojing, Cheng Jingsheng, Zhou Zuomin, Wang Qingmu, Chen Taoyi, Qing Lan, Di Chuqing, Tang Wenzhi, Chu Nanqiang, Wu Tongju, Shen Weixian, Su Qiliu, Dong Xiujia, Wu Chongxue, Liu Yizheng, Jiang Ruo, Qian Linshu, Xie Renbing, Cai Pei, Qian Jihou, Zhu Tinghua, Yang Yongqing, Shi Shengzhi, Jiang Shaofan, Qu Qiping, Pang Shusen, Shen Enfu, Yang Weiyu, Li Xichun, Shen Baojun, Liu Kejun, Zhang Jingli, Zhu Jiazhen, Zhu Bofu, Tian Yufan, Wang Shuxiang, Zhu Shaowen, Xu Dingnian, Liu Zhonglu, Ji Longtu, Huang Pichen, Cai Baolian, Zhou Jingcheng, Shi Mingyong, Wang Hongzao, Jiao Fengming, Xie Shuqiang, Yu Shusen, and Wang Zhanwei, etc.

### Ministry of Education Subsidizes Various Colleges and Universities to Also Run Social Education - Six Schools with Excellent Results Have Been Subsidized

(Chongqing Air Mail) Since the Ministry of Education issued a general order last year requiring schools at all levels to also run social education, it has been actively urging schools to implement it and has stipulated that those who achieve excellent results in running social education may request subsidies in order to achieve greater results. It has recently been learned that many schools at all levels across the country have reported the situation of running social education to the Ministry of Education for verification and have requested subsidies. The Ministry of Education then conducted strict assessments, and the schools with excellent results include Jiangsu Provincial Education College, Sichuan Provincial Education College, National Northwest Associated University Normal College, Daxia University Education College, Jinling University Agricultural College, and West China University. All six schools have been granted subsidies to show their encouragement.

### Ministry of Education Rectifies and Subsidizes Private Colleges and Universities - Ten Schools Have Been Rectified and Closed in the Past - Subsidized Subjects Focus on Science

(Chongqing Special Dispatch) Private colleges and universities were not strictly restricted under the old system, so they were inevitably established indiscriminately. Since the regulations on private schools were promulgated in the 18th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Education has strictly cracked down on substandard private schools. In Shanghai, schools that have been ordered to close one after another include Qunzhi and Xinmin Universities, as well as Nanyang Medical College. In Beiping, there are Yuwen and other three universities, in Nanjing there is the Cultural College, in Guangzhou there is the Guangzhou Law College, and in Suzhou there is the Zhongshan Physical Education College. The procedures for the registration of private colleges and universities require that staff be sent to conduct detailed inspections. If found to be suitable, the registration is generally not allowed. After registration, if the school is poorly managed or unlikely to develop, the registration will be revoked or it will be ordered to close down in stages. The revocation of the registration of schools in North China is one example. Also, the Private Railway College was ordered to change to a vocational school from the 25th year of the Republic due to poor management. In order to improve higher education, the Ministry of Education sends special staff to various places every year to inspect public and private colleges and universities. After the inspection, they have been ordered to improve separately. The common points of improvement ordered to various schools over the years include: streamlining departments and faculties, enriching equipment, strictly implementing the system of full-time vocational teachers, and cultivating the spirit of automatic research among students.

The Ministry of Education is determined to rectify poorly managed private colleges and universities and also provides subsidies to excellent private schools to support their development. In addition to those approved for special subsidies, 720,000 yuan is allocated annually from the national treasury from the 23rd year of the Republic to subsidize the faculty fees and equipment costs of various schools. In the 26th year of the Republic, the amount increased from 720,000 yuan to 1.22 million yuan annually. The schools that received subsidies in the 23rd and 24th years were 32 schools including Jinling University. In the 25th year, in addition to the original 32 schools, 8 schools including Aurora University were added, for a total of 40 schools. In the 26th year, Fujian College and Shanghai Law College were added, and in addition to private schools, 6 provincial Henan University and others were added. In the 27th year, one or two new schools were added, remaining at more than 40 schools mentioned above. According to regulations, 70% of the subsidy items are used to add scientific equipment, and 30% are used to hire teachers of special subjects. In the current year, due to factual needs, slight changes have been made. Under specified circumstances, the faculty fees can be used to pay the salaries of existing professors, and the equipment costs can be used to build school buildings. According to regulations, subsidized subjects focus on the development of science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine, accounting for more than 70% of the total subsidy.

### Zhejiang University to Establish a Branch in Longquan - Enrollment to Begin in July

(Lishui News) Since the fall of Hangzhou, the National Zhejiang University moved from Jiande to Jiangxi, and last summer, it was ordered by the ministry to move to Yishan, Guangxi. It has been nearly a year since then. Although the educational circles and all sectors of Zhejiang Province are relatively isolated from the situation of the school, they are still very concerned. People in Zhejiang Province still hope that Zhejiang University will return to Zhejiang, so that young people graduating from middle schools in Zhejiang Province will have more opportunities to study nearby. President Zhu of the school, in view of this, previously sent Dean of Academic Affairs Zheng Xiaocang back to Zhejiang to discuss everything with the provincial government authorities. The details have been reported in the news. It is now learned that Zheng has repeatedly received telegrams from President Zhu stating that Zhejiang University has decided to establish a branch in order to meet the needs of the people of Zhejiang Province who are eager for Zhejiang University to return to Zhejiang. The location is roughly in Longquan. As for the position of director of the branch, it will be officially announced soon. Preparations are now being actively made, and enrollment procedures will begin in July.

### Beggar Children's Home - Site Difficult to Determine

The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association, in view of the large number of homeless and orphaned children wandering the streets of the city, specifically decided to establish a beggar children's home through the board of directors to provide shelter and relief, and appointed Chairman and Vice Chairman Chen Heqin and others to actively carry out all arrangements for planning and constructing the school so that children's relief organizations can be established as soon as possible. However, due to the difficulty in determining the site for the school, the establishment of the beggar children's home will still take some time.

### World Student Association Handles Registration of Students Studying Abroad - From Now Until the Beginning of August

The World Chinese Student Association is holding its annual registration of students studying abroad as the summer vacation is approaching and the season for students studying abroad is coming. This year's registration will be held from now until the beginning of August. All registrants will not be charged a handling fee.

### Ministry of Education Attention: Children's Education - Many Enterprises Handled During Children's Year Aims to Provide Relief, Care, and Education for Refugee Children

(Chongqing Dispatch) The Ministry of Education is paying great attention to children's education. Based on the suggestion of the China Child Welfare Association, the "Outline of Implementation Measures for the National Children's Year" was announced in April of the 24th year (1935), with the period from August of the 24th year to July of the 25th year designated as Children's Year. The central government, with personnel from the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Industries, organized the National Children's Year Implementation Committee. Each province, city, and county also established its own Children's Year Implementation Committee with the purpose of promoting the welfare of children.

The important matters handled by the National Children's Year Implementation Committee include: holding children's book exhibitions, children's educational tool and toy exhibitions, children's painting exhibitions, children's hygiene exhibitions, publishing various pamphlets related to children's welfare, establishing a children's problem consultation center to answer questions related to children's education and health, setting up children's problem lectures and broadcasting talks on children's issues every week, holding summer children's health camps, designating May 15th as Health Inspection Day, initiating a national student donation drive to help children in disaster areas, promoting improved treatment for child laborers and apprentices, improving childcare institutions nationwide, supervising schools to establish parent-teacher associations, and improving family education. All these measures have promoted the progress of children's education.

Furthermore, since the outbreak of the war, many children have been displaced from war zones. To provide relief, the Ministry of Education, in cooperation with the Central Relief Committee and other organizations, formulated relief plans in the 27th year (1938) and actively implemented them. To date, over 30,000 refugee children have been rescued and cared for by the Relief Committee and the Wartime Children's Care Association. Most of the teachers and staff are assigned by the Ministry, and living expenses are provided by the Ministry.

### Lido Swimming Group Established

The Lido Sports Association held a main meeting yesterday and resolved to establish a swimming group and provide the swimming pool entirely for the training of group members, no longer open to the public. It will start recruiting male and female members immediately, but they must be of good character, physically sound, and introduced by a member of the group to participate. Training will be divided into classes, with each class lasting two to two and a half hours. Each day, from 6:00 AM to 8:30 PM, there are currently six classes. There are also plans to set up special classes for women and children, but this will depend on whether there are enough participants.

Ordinary members will pay a membership fee of 20 yuan, but can only enter the pool during the assigned class time. Special members will pay a quarterly fee of 15 yuan and will not be subject to time restrictions.

### US Ambassador Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday - Scheduled to Proceed to Chongqing - To Meet with Chinese Authorities at the End of the Month - No Comment on the Situation in the Concession

Dr. Johnson, the US Ambassador to China, returned to his post by ship from the US on the President Coolidge, arriving in Shanghai at 8:30 AM yesterday. The ship docked at floating pontoons 11 and 12 in the Huangpu River. US Navy Commander Yarnell, Consul General Gauss, and the Chief Judge of the US Court for China, Mr. and Mrs. Helmick, went to welcome him on a Navy motorboat. Ambassador Johnson looked energetic and greeted the welcomers warmly. At 9:30 AM, he changed to a small motorboat and landed at the Customs Wharf, proceeding directly to the Cathay Hotel for a brief rest. At around 10:00 AM, he inspected the US Consulate on Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road. When reporters asked the US Ambassador for his opinion on the Gulangyu incident and the recent situation in the Shanghai Concession, the Ambassador remained silent, smiling but not answering. He only said that he was very happy to return to China. It is reported that Ambassador Johnson will stay in Shanghai briefly and then take the Canadian Empress ship to Hong Kong on the 31st, and will then proceed to Chongqing to meet with the Chinese government authorities. The Ambassador's wife and others will go to Beiping to escape the summer heat.

Western Newspapers Report

According to the English-language Da Mei Wanbao (Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury), US Ambassador Johnson, after returning from vacation in the United States, arrived in Shanghai this morning (the 24th) on the President Coolidge. The Chief Judge of the US Court for China, Mr. Helmick, boarded the ship to welcome him. After having breakfast on the ship, the Ambassador took a large boat belonging to Admiral Yarnell to the Customs Wharf and went to the Cathay Hotel, where he will stay during his time in Shanghai. Inquiring reporters asked him many questions about the status of the Shanghai

International Settlement.

The Ambassador replied with the following attitude: "All we talked about in Wyoming were sheep, cattle, and horses. The sheep season there is quite good." The Ambassador remained silent on political matters, saying that for the past two months, he had tried to avoid contact with political disputes and had used all his time to entertain himself. He spent a month and a half in Washington and the rest of his time in

Wyoming. The Ambassador also made a trip to San Francisco and toured the Golden Gate International Exposition. He said that the exposition was very beautiful. Mr. Johnson also made a broadcast speech via radio waves from the Baodao Radio Station in San Francisco, which was clearly received in Shanghai. The Ambassador also said, "I enjoyed my vacation very much, but I am also very happy to return to my post." The Ambassador will stay in Shanghai until May 31st, and then take the Canadian Empress ship to Hong Kong, and then proceed to Kunming via Haiphong

or Hanoi, and then take a car to Chongqing. When asked about the condition of the highway from Kunming to Chongqing, the Ambassador smiled and said, "I don't know, but I hope it is very good." The Ambassador's wife and two children will not accompany him to Chongqing, but will go to Beiping, departing for North China on the US warship Isabel at the end of this month. US Navy officers' families traveling to North China and the US resident commissioner

McNutt may return to Shanghai on the Isabel. When asked about the journey, the Ambassador replied that it was the calmest trip he had ever taken across the Pacific Ocean. The weather was gloomy and foggy, but the sea was as smooth as a mirror. Johnson said that his meeting with McNutt was not yet certain, as McNutt may have already traveled south when Johnson arrived in Shanghai.

### Japanese Troops Landed on Daishan - The Situation is Not Serious - The Purpose May Be to Seize Fish and Salt - Shipping in Shanghai is Not Affected - Fierce Artillery Battles Occurred at the Oujiang Estuary

According to Daguan News Agency, on the morning of the 22nd, 300 Japanese troops landed in the Langluzui area of Daishan in the Zhoushan Islands, surrounded by seven Japanese warships, seemingly with the intention of occupying the area for a long time. This has attracted considerable attention from all sectors. According to inquiries with the shipping industry, Daishan is one of the Zhoushan Islands, located one hundred li from Dinghai. It is a small island, isolated at sea, and extremely remote. Most of the residents are engaged in fishing. It is currently the fishing season, and the local fish production is very abundant, such as yellow croaker and squid, which are all available in large quantities. The purpose of the Japanese troops landing is obviously to seize fish products. It was verified that Japanese troops also landed on the island once last year, but retreated shortly thereafter. It has no military significance, so the reports that Japanese troops are building fortifications are likely inaccurate.

According to Xinsheng News Agency, regarding the Japanese troops landing on Daishan Island in the Zhoushan Islands, the Dinghai Shanghai Fellow Association and various shipping companies stated that they had not received any telegram from Dinghai. In addition to fishermen, Daishan is also the only salt-producing area in eastern Zhejiang. The intention of the Japanese troops to land may be to seize salt. However, the situation is definitely not serious. We are sure to receive a telegram in Shanghai soon.

According to Xin Xin News Agency, on the morning of the 22nd, Japanese troops did land at Langluzui in Daishan Island, Zhoushan Islands. The local Civilian Defence Corps and militiamen rose up to resist, but due to being outnumbered, they are now dispersed in the suburbs and are conducting guerrilla activities. Although there are rumors in Dinghai, the situation is still peaceful. Japanese planes fly reconnaissance missions from time to time, but people have become accustomed to it, and the public is calm. Business is very slow, and business hours have been changed to night markets. The authorities have tightened security along the coast of Dinghai.

### Shanghai Shipping - Not Affected

Daishan is one hundred li away from Dinghai, so although Japanese troops have landed there and Japanese warships are surrounding the area, it has no effect on shipping to and from Shanghai. The Hana, which arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Dinghai, changed its course to Wenzhou entirely due to cargo congestion and had been decided several days ago. It was not a change of route due to the Daishan incident, and the Shipping Bureau did not prohibit it. The ship was originally scheduled to sail to Wenzhou this morning, but due to lack of time, it was changed to this afternoon. It is expected to resume sailing to Dinghai after one or two voyages. As for the Gaodeng, which sails between Ningbo and Dinghai, it sailed from Ningbo to Dinghai on the 23rd. Because the Hana has changed its course to Wenzhou, the number of passengers on the Ningbo-Dinghai route is small, and it will be temporarily suspended to avoid losses.

### Moufu Returns to Shanghai - Ningbo City is Desolate

The Moufu, owned by the German company Reiss & Co., made its first trial voyage to Ningbo on the morning of the 19th and arrived safely that evening. It returned to Shanghai from Ningbo at 5:00 AM yesterday morning, arriving at the port at approximately 5:00 PM, carrying goods such as native paper, tin foil, eggs, and bamboo shoots. As the Ningbo authorities strictly prohibited passengers from boarding, there were no passengers. According to the crew of the Moufu, after Ningbo was bombed, the bustling city center, such as Lingqiao Gate, Dongmen Street, Baizhang Street, and Tianhou Palace, with its once prosperous shops, is now a pile of ruins and rubble, a scene of desolation. About six or seven tenths of all residents have voluntarily evacuated to the countryside to avoid the fierce flames of Japanese aircraft. Most of the shops are closed, and only a few operate for a few hours in the evening in Jiangbei to meet needs, so the market is extremely desolate.

### Zhenhai Bombed - Damage Investigated

On the morning of the 22nd, four Japanese planes invaded the airspace over Zhenhai, conducting low-flying reconnaissance for fifteen minutes, then dropping bombs indiscriminately and strafing with machine guns. Our anti-aircraft artillery immediately fired at the Japanese planes, breaking up their formation. After hastily dropping ten bombs, they fled in the original direction. An investigation revealed that the locations where the Japanese planes dropped bombs in Zhenhai were: one bomb landed inside the East Gate of the city in a vocational school, three bombs landed at the foot of Zhaobao Mountain, and three bombs landed in Jiangnan. The casualties included a worker named Shen Tianshou (age 53) from the Yuande Temple, and two elderly women, Ms. Lu Zheng, from Dingxiang Lane, and injured civilians including Zhou Zhixiang (age 28), a monk named Benshen (age 51) from Haiyun Temple, a school worker Qian Abao, a resident of Yuande Temple Wang Zailai, a woman in front of the Yu family gate Wang Shenshi, and a child Wang Jinfang, age 5, totaling six people. More than fifty houses were destroyed. The injured were sent to Tongze Hospital for treatment by Ningbo Red Cross, Zhengxian Red Swastika Society, and other rescue workers. It is reported that there are currently two Japanese warships outside of Zhenhai at Lin Daishan, and another Japanese warship is docked at Dongda Island, but there have been no unusual movements. The garrison has tightened security.

### Oujiang Artillery Battle - Feikang Blocked

According to Xinsheng News Agency, the Oujiang estuary in Wenzhou experienced a fierce artillery battle yesterday morning. The German company Lu Lin Yangxing's Feikang was blocked outside the Oujiang estuary yesterday morning, and did not enter the Oujiang until 8:00 AM this morning, safely arriving in Wenzhou. The British company Lianyi Shipping's Xinxiangtai sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou yesterday.

### Wang Jingwei Quietly Left Shanghai - Activity in Hongkou Failed - Zhou Fohai and Others Still Trying to Struggle

After Wang Jingwei led his party members from Hanoi to Shanghai, his wife Chen Bijun also followed him to Shanghai, hiding in Hongkou and engaging in activities. These conspiracies have now all failed. Wang and Chen, together with their henchmen, quietly left Shanghai under the protection of the Japanese, crestfallen. However, it is reported that Zhou Fohai and others are still active in Shanghai.

### Yellow Plum Season Approaching - Hoarders Emerging - Shanghai Rice Prices Decline - Supply Sources Cleared - No Worry for the Whole Food Supply - 20,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Will be Shipped to Shanghai to Adjust

After the rice industry associations have made great efforts to clear the sources of domestic rice, Wuhu and other places have successively lifted the bans. As sources have gradually increased and stocks have become abundant, and with the Yellow Plum season approaching, hoarders have been scrambling to sell, and prices have declined. Market conditions have gradually returned to normal. An order of 20,000 bags of foreign rice has been placed and will be shipped to Shanghai. The details are recorded below.

### Hoarders Emerging - Rice Prices Decline

Yesterday morning at the bean and rice market, as the rice-producing areas have successively lifted the bans and sources have increased and stocks are sufficient, and as the Yellow Plum season is approaching, the rice that has been hoarded is prone to rot and infestation, so hoarders have been scrambling to sell, and prices have declined. Market conditions have gradually returned to normal. The price of top-grade white rice was 17 yuan and 6 jiao, with a total of over 4,000 bags sold. It is expected that rice prices will not rise again during this Yellow Plum season, but there may be another rise when the old and new crops are not yet available. However, there is no worry about Shanghai's overall food supply.

### 洋米 二萬包 已成交

New Voice News Agency reporters inquired at the Dafo Foreign Firm yesterday and learned that the order for Saigon foreign rice placed by rice businesses in this city to be shipped to Shanghai for price stabilization, a batch of 20,000 bags (equivalent to 2,000 tons) had been agreed upon a few days ago. The price was set at 19.40 yuan per large bag in national currency. The rice is scheduled to be loaded onto ships in Saigon in early next month and transported to Shanghai, arriving in late June or at the end of June. However, the foreign firm is acting as an agent on behalf of merchants and is not purchasing on its own behalf. In addition, the foreign rice is imported duty-free because the Jianghai Customs has been waiving duties on imported foreign rice since its fall.

### 當局 調查 滬市存米

Since the Rice Industry Evaluation Committee dispatched special personnel to investigate the rice stocks in various rice warehouses in Shanghai, it has reached the eighth period. The ninth period of investigation has already begun and will be announced early next week. According to sources in the rice industry, the authorities of the two concessions are very concerned about the future of the rice industry. In addition to replying to the Soybean and Rice Trade Association that it is permissible to work with police officers to intervene, suppress black market dealings, seek to clear channels for inland supply, and consider purchasing foreign rice, they are now considering investigating the names of hoarders and the total amount of rice stored in Shanghai for reference in order to suppress black market dealings. It is reported that personnel have been assigned to start investigating the amount of rice in storage.

### 來源趨 增 隱憂 可除

Recently, rice-producing areas such as Wuhu, Changshu, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Tongli, and Bachai have successively lifted their bans, allowing domestic rice exports. With the best efforts of merchants, the supply to Shanghai has gradually increased. The amount of rice arriving yesterday has indeed increased. Yesterday, six or seven boats from the HeXia Nangang group arrived, and 5,000 to 6,000 bags were transported by Kulun No. 2. However, hoarders in the market are releasing their stocks, weakening the demand, resulting in an oversupply. Previously, citizens citywide were uneasy due to the chaotic market conditions and rising rice prices. Now, with the increasing supply and the agreed-upon large quantities of foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai, people's hearts have become more at ease, and the hidden concerns can be dispelled.

### 市塲 會議 招待 限價

The Shanghai Soybean and Rice Trade Association has decided to maintain the resolution of the seven rice industry groups at the third joint meeting, setting the maximum rice price at 15 yuan, and has issued a notice to the Market Management Committee to strictly enforce it. Yesterday morning, the market convened a meeting of representatives from various trade merchants and guest groups at the close of the market, reporting on the measures to be followed as previously agreed by the rice industry groups, deciding to continue implementation. It is hoped that all buying and selling merchants will trade fairly and not engage in black market dealings. If discovered, they will be punished according to the penalty regulations.

### 長江英輪 首次復航 漢口英軍調防 瓜代部隊係由本市調派 乘英輪前往由英艦護送

British Army troops stationed in the Hankou Concession will soon be transferred. The replacement troops are dispatched from this city. The team has already been assigned. It is heard that the British troops are scheduled to depart within this month, taking two of the Yangtze River passenger liners of the British merchant shipping companies. In addition, two freighters from the two oil companies will follow, carrying military supplies and food. The US Navy has specially dispatched two warships to escort them. After the four merchant ships arrive in Hankou, the British troops will disembark, and then the ships will load the British troops being withdrawn from Hankou and return to Shanghai. Although this is a troop transport to Hankou, it can also be called the first resumption of British merchant ships after the blockade of the Yangtze River.

### 路軌 時遭 撬毀 京滬 交通 梗阻 錫六二號橋雖已修復 商旅深具戒心客貨運銳減

The guerrillas in the Eastern Theater have been ordered by the central government to be reorganized and trained by the military officers of the directly governed districts, and then assigned to specific areas to carry out guerrilla work. They are most active on the transportation arteries. Although the rails of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway line are often destroyed, even within the heavily guarded areas of the Japanese troops, they can appear and disappear unpredictably, making it impossible for the Japanese to defend against. Trains are delayed every day, and bullets frequently fly over the carriages when passing through desolate sections of the railway. Therefore, merchants and travelers are very wary, and the transportation of passengers and goods is decreasing daily.

### 被毀 橋樑 業已修復

Bridge No. 62 on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway (near Baimao) was suddenly destroyed by Chinese troops at around 10:00 AM on the 21st of this month. The sleepers across the east and west bridge abutments were completely removed, and the bridge piers were also destroyed by burning with kerosene. Therefore, all vehicles could not pass through. After the Japanese side sent craftsmen to repair it urgently, it was completed the night before last (the 23rd). However, freight and passenger vehicles weighing more than five tons are temporarily prohibited from traveling to avoid danger.

### 各項 客貨 昨晨 復運

After learning about the destruction of the highway bridges, all transportation companies in this port stopped loading all kinds of passengers and goods between Shanghai and Wuxi, Shanghai and Changshu, and Shanghai and Suzhou, and sent personnel to investigate the situation along the highway. Now that Pier No. 60 has been repaired, all companies resumed loading goods and passengers at 6:00 AM yesterday. However, because the Japanese-run Dazhi, Taicang, and other transportation companies were frequently attacked, merchants and traders did not dare to entrust them, and switched to shipping with companies organized by Chinese merchants. It is reported that the two trucks destroyed were valued at a total loss of 40,000 to 50,000 yuan.

### 英軍 新司令 今日 到滬

The Zi Lin Daily reports that the newly appointed British Army Commander in Shanghai, Major General Simmons, is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 25th). According to the current arrangements, Major General Xi is scheduled to land at the Customs Wharf at 9:15 AM. British commanders, staff officers, and members of the honor guard of the British Army in Shanghai will welcome him at the Customs Wharf. Within a few days after arriving in Shanghai, Major General Xi will visit various officials and other defense commanders. Major General Xi was born in 1888. From 1936, he served as the commander of the Southern Brigade, stationed in Palestine, until this decision to take on a new position.

### 日貨 鉅量 傾銷 已達 二千 餘萬 佔輸入國別 之第二位

After the Jianghai Customs regained control of the national trade center, the location of the customs has been lost, and they were forced to change the low tax rate, resulting in a change of flags. Tax revenues are deposited in Japanese banks. Therefore, under these special circumstances, Japanese goods are imported and dumped in huge quantities, jumping from the fifth place to the second. The trade of the United Kingdom and the United States has been affected. The following is a list of the value of imports and exports of various countries from January to April this year: (1) Imports: United States 38,522,200 yuan, Japan 20,077,700 yuan, United Kingdom 11,228,100 yuan. Compared with the same period last year, Japanese goods increased by 18,888,800 yuan, jumping from the fifth place to the second place. (2) Exports: United States 21,912,200 yuan, United Kingdom 11,155,700 yuan, Germany 12,277,700 yuan, Japan 10,231,100 yuan, Hong Kong 16,914,000 yuan. Compared with the same period last year, Japanese goods increased by 9,800,400 yuan.

### 英商 綸昌 工人 聲明 不受 利用 至誠 希望 廠方 解決 糾紛 挑撥 離間 無所 施其 伎倆

The workers of the British-owned Lun Chang Printing and Dyeing Company in Lujiazui, Pudong, have been on strike for several days due to the dismissal of workers, which has not yet been resolved. The workers issued a statement yesterday, the original text of which is excerpted as follows: "The workers have been working at Lun Chang for many years, and the relationship between labor and capital is still considered cooperative. Last Saturday, a Russian doorman beat a worker and dismissed a worker named Gu Jingen. The workers believed that Gu had been working in the factory without any fault, and sent three representatives to the company to make demands. Not only were they rejected, but they also wanted to dismiss all the representatives, which led to a strike by all the workers to promote cooperation between labor and capital. However, several newspapers have reprinted the news from 'Xin Shenbao,' saying that this strike was incited by the 'Reformed Government' and the 'Great People's Association,' which is a complete slander. Although the workers are very foolish, their national and ethnic stance should not be so disregarded. At this time, when behind-the-scenes people are promoting anti-British sentiment, instigating dissension is only temporary, and the truth will eventually come to light. The workers sincerely hope that the factory will resolve the issue immediately, so that the instigators will have no place to use their tricks. We are deeply afraid that the outside world will not understand the truth, and therefore make a solemn statement." According to a report from the Da Guang News Agency, after the Lun Chang strike occurred, the "China Workers' Welfare Association" and the "Great People's Association" and others did indeed instigate and make a fuss about the issue, but the workers clearly understood the righteousness and, in addition to struggling for life, decided not to be used by others.

The British Consulate has announced that the British Marines have agreed to withdraw from Bailianjing, but the Japanese army should be responsible for maintaining security in the area. The British Army stationed in the Lun Chang Textile Factory will not be withdrawn. The British military department has announced that 26 British troops stationed in Shanghai have been ordered to be stationed in the Lun Chang Factory in Pudong to take over from the Marines. According to British reports received a few days ago, the "Reformed Government" in Nanjing intends to incite anti-British labor unrest in Shanghai, and sent some Marines to the Lun Chang Textile Factory in Pudong on the 20th. Later, a strike did occur in the factory. The Japanese then claimed that anti-British labor unrest would continue to erupt, and a strike occurred in a British-owned printing factory in Bailianjing. The British side attaches great importance to this.

護廠 英軍 昨已 瓜代

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that a labor dispute occurred in the British-owned Lun Chang Textile Factory in Pudong a few days ago, believed to be in response to the anti-British movement. A small team of British sailors from the destroyer Colair was dispatched to protect the factory. Now, British Army soldiers have gone to replace and guard it.

激起 罷工 英軍 護廠

After the Lun Chang Textile Factory announced the dismissal of Gu Jinsheng, a coppersmith who violated the factory regulations three times last Saturday, it aroused opposition from male and female workers and clashed with the factory's Russian patrolmen, resulting in a strike. A small number of objects in the factory were destroyed. After 30 to 40 British Navy personnel landed and suppressed the workers, order was restored. The factory is now guarded by British troops day and night. The back door is tightly locked and faces the Huangpu River. Therefore, the stalemate between labor and capital has lasted for five days, and no accidents have occurred.

白蓮涇 廠 亦起 糾紛

Lun Chang Company also has a dyeing and weaving factory in Bailianjing, Pudong, which was established earlier than the previous factory. There are more than 600 male and female workers. At 6:00 AM yesterday, a small number of workers in the factory also joined the work stoppage. However, because the majority of the workers in the factory understood the meaning of labor-capital cooperation and refused to participate, the situation did not escalate. After hearing the news, the British Navy authorities urgently sent 30 soldiers to land and stand by, dispersing more than 100 striking workers from the factory. The entrance of the factory was guarded by British troops, and order was quickly restored.

廠外 日軍 一度 戒嚴

After the old factory in Bailianjing continued to have disputes yesterday morning, the external situation became quite tense. The Japanese Army also sent more than 200 soldiers to scatter sentries around the factory at 6:00 AM, declaring a temporary state of martial law. At the entrance of the factory, British soldiers set up four machine guns, providing strict protection at a certain distance from each other, and did not interfere with each other. By 9:00 AM, the situation had eased, and the Japanese side began to withdraw the state of martial law and restore the original state.

工人 集會 僞方 發款

At 2:00 PM yesterday, a so-called "General Assembly of All Workers" was convened on the open space in front of the pseudo-Southern District Public Office in Dongchang Road, Pudong. As a result, only a few people attended. They began to organize a so-called "Strike Committee." The pseudo-"Office" began to "register" the workers, which was completed at 5:00 PM. Each person was given one yuan for travel expenses and it was decided that so-called "relief funds" would be issued again at 9:00 AM next Monday to express "assistance."

東昌路 貼 反英 標語

Many anti-British slogans were posted on the walls of the Dongchang Road Wharf yesterday. There were five or six kinds of slogans, and the words were mostly absurd and unfounded. Many passengers entering and exiting the ferry gathered to watch. However, upon closer inspection, no one came forward to sign the anti-British slogans, which was obviously a kind of irresponsible propaganda.

However, since May, Portuguese ships traveling to and from Chinese ports have almost disappeared. As for those already

### 日兵 進佔 里弄 事 工部局 不擬 干預 認為 並非 新起 之爭執 日方的 係 迫納 捐稅

The Continental News reported yesterday (the 23rd) that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession does not intend to take any action regarding the occupation of two lanes on Yuyuan Road by Japanese soldiers on Saturday and Sunday, claiming that the issue of lanes along the roads outside the concession has never been resolved and is not a new dispute arising from the Sino-Japanese War. According to well-informed sources, the confiscation of these two lanes is intended to increase the income of the puppet regime, and it is believed that residents will be forced to pay taxes to the "Shanghai Municipal Government." It is understood that the residents of these lanes still pay taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council. Even before the war, the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Chinese authorities had many disputes over these lanes. The problem has not been properly agreed upon. A few months before the outbreak of the war in 1937, the police blocked the entrances and exits of a lane near Difeng Road with wire mesh because the residents refused to pay taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council.

### 外國 銀行 果 接受 興紙 乎 日方 已作 此說 但不 和係 何 銀行 海關 方面 對偽 幣問題 尙未 談到

The Zi Lin Daily reports that the Japanese spokesman told reporters at the Vale News yesterday (the 23rd) that several foreign banks have accepted the Hua Xing Bank's paper money, but he does not know which banks they are. The spokesman mentioned various American banks to a reporter and asked whether these banks have accepted Hua Xing paper money. The spokesman also firmly refuted the claim that Hua Xing currency is being used at a discount. It is claimed that the Hua Xing head office has used its paper money to exchange foreign currency, and Japanese banks are also exchanging Hua Xing currency for legal tender. It is also said that no arrangements have been made with the customs to accept Hua Xing currency so far.

兩種 偽幣 劃河 為界

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reports that a committee organized by the "Joint Reserve Bank" and the liaison department of the Japanese Asia Development Board will come to Shanghai to discuss the cooperation between the "Joint Reserve" currency and the new "Hongkou" currency with the newly established Hua Xing Commercial Bank. According to the Tokyo newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun, the puppet regimes in Beiping and Nanjing have agreed in principle that the two currencies should be linked to each other at a fixed rate, but that both currencies should maintain a fixed and non-excessive circulation area. The Japanese financial community expects that the circulation areas of the two counterfeit currencies will be divided along the Yellow River, with the "Joint Reserve" currency circulating north of the river and the "Hongkou" currency circulating south of the river.

### 陳德容 會計師 論戰 事 損失

列作 遞延 資產

有 相當 之根據

Certified Public Accountant Chen Derong discusses the deferral of war losses and says that listing them as deferred assets seems to have considerable basis in both accounting practice and theory. There are four main points: (1) Basis in accounting practice: According to the Regulations of the General Equalization Table of Railway Accounting in China, there is an item called Accumulated Deficit. Its nature is similar to war losses and is a virtual number of assets. (2) Basis in accounting principles: According to the accounting book written by Accountant Pan Xulun, there is an expenditure that is absolutely a loss to the enterprise, but because it cannot be borne by the income of the current period, or it is obviously unfair to treat it as a loss of the current period, it can be temporarily treated as capital expenditure and included in the balance sheet. Its meaning is very simple and its principle is very clear. The same may be said of war losses. (3) The British Income Tax Act has similar provisions: According to the British Income Tax Act, business losses can be deducted within the next six years. (4) Approval can be based on: According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs' consultation with the Ministry of Finance's approval, it can be approved and amortized over ten years, so it seems that it is also based on deferred assets. Others will be discussed in detail in my article "Further Clarification on the Issue of War Losses as Deferred Assets" in the June issue of Selected Essays Monthly.

Accompanying him were his wife and sons and daughters, as well as Rear Admiral Glassford, the newly appointed commander of the Yangtze River Naval Fleet. U.S. Far East Naval Commander Yarnell, U.S. Consul General to Shanghai Gauss, U.S. Judge to China and Mrs. Hillme, and others all went to welcome him.

The ambassador and General Yarnell shook hands happily on the ship's deck and exchanged greetings. They then transferred to the U.S. Navy speedboat and landed at the Customs Wharf. The ambassador was as energetic as ever, in good spirits, wearing a gray casual suit and tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses. He then went by car to the Huamao Hotel for a brief rest and then went to the embassy office on Jiangxi Road to meet with visiting guests. The ambassador told visiting reporters that he would go to Chongqing to meet with the Chinese authorities. The ambassador remained silent on recent political issues in the Far East, only smiling and saying that he had no opinion.

It is also learned that after the U.S. ambassador arrives in Shanghai, meets with various parties, and takes a short rest, his departure date for Chongqing is tentatively scheduled to be on the 31st, taking the Canadian Empress to Hong Kong, and then transferring to Chongqing to visit Foreign Minister Wang and various authorities.

### Infatuated with Gambling Dens and Unable to Break Free: A Female Servant Commits Theft and Goes to Jail; All the Accumulated Hard-Earned Money is Lost to Gambling; Thief Steals Mistress's Cash and Regrets Confessing

In the Western District of this city, in the Chinese-controlled area, since the opening of various gambling establishments, there have been numerous cases of people becoming infatuated with them, leading to financial ruin and criminal behavior. Among the deeply affected, Tang Xiuying, a woman from Yangzhou who was sentenced to imprisonment yesterday for theft due to gambling debts, is a prime example. Her case serves as a warning to those who are addicted to gambling and unable to break free. The facts are as follows:

Tang Xiuying is from Yangzhou, currently thirty-eight years old. She has a son and a daughter, both still young. Her family was originally poor. Lacking the courage and ability to support herself, she came to Shanghai alone at the age of nineteen to work as a servant. For twenty years, her employers were all foreigners, and she earned a good wage. The woman was also good at saving. Despite the expenses of her husband's death and raising her children, she still had more than five thousand yuan in national currency. For an uneducated woman to sell her life's labor and accumulate such a fortune is truly remarkable.

Her usual thriftiness can be imagined. Unfortunately, now that she is middle-aged, she has been tempted by the outside world. In recent months, she would take advantage of gaps in her work to take her money to the Hollywood gambling den. Every time she gambled, she lost, returning only when she was penniless. Before a month had passed, she ran out of money and conceived the idea of stealing. She then stole nine hundred French francs from the bedroom of Mrs. George Hagen, an American young woman who employed her at No. 3, Lane 108, Cangzhou Road, as a last-ditch effort. But eventually she was left empty-handed.

She had no face to face her employer and quietly fled last Saturday. After three nights, she suddenly felt that everything was wrong and decided to reform herself. So, she surrendered herself to the Gordon Road Police Station the day before yesterday. The employer had already reported the theft to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. The woman was arrested and detained. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the First Special District Local Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, stated the defendant's theft behavior and requested legal action. The American mistress also explained the discovery of the theft. When questioned, Tang Xiuying immediately confessed that she had been confused and lost all her savings before resorting to theft. She did not deny that she had lost everything. She cried bitterly during the confession, and her resentment was almost palpable. She pleaded for leniency to avoid leaving her two children without support. Judge Zhan Liangce, after reviewing the case, sentenced Tang Xiuying to three months of imprisonment for continuous theft. The woman seemed to understand that the punishment fit the crime and expressed her willingness to accept it. She was then taken to the women's prison.

### No. 864, Yuyuan Road: A New Gambling Den

Complex Membership with Political Implications; Concession Authorities are Closely Watching

According to the Daguang News Agency, several new gambling dens have recently been established in the area beyond the concessions on Yuyuan Road, causing even greater harm to the people than floods and fierce beasts. No. 864 Yuyuan Road has been planning to organize a large-scale gambling den for a long time. Due to the failure to obtain understanding from certain quarters, preparations were temporarily suspended. Recently, a certain party came forward to preside over and announce its realization. The organizers have extremely complex backgrounds, and the content has a political nature. However, the gambling aspect is harmful to society. Authorities are now watching how it develops in order to take appropriate measures to strictly ban it.

### Even a Cunning Rabbit Has Three Burrows, But Still Gets Caught; Master of the Opium Den Arrested

Chen Zhengjin (nickname "A Wu Jin"), an unemployed rogue, has been running three opium dens (nicknamed "Swallow's Nest") for a long time: No. 97, 2nd Floor, Hengmao Lane, Mintini Yin Road, French Concession; No. 16, Baoyu Lane, No. 120, Ningxing Street (i.e. Caishi Street), 2nd Floor Pavilion; and Room 618, Central Hotel, Wuma Road, Public Concession. He specializes in selling opium for people to smoke and profit from, and has accumulated considerable wealth. He usually has his wife's younger sister, A Zhao (about eleven or twelve years old), deliver the opium. The day before yesterday at about 11 PM, A Zhao, carrying five taels of opium, walked to the general lane of Baoyu Lane, and was searched by the French and Chinese detectives of the Mailan Police Station's search team who were searching pedestrians in Baoyu Lane because they saw A Zhao looking flustered. The detectives found opium in A Zhao's pocket and took her to the police station. A Zhao confessed the location of her brother-in-law A Wu Jin's opium dens. The Chinese and French detectives, along with A Zhao, first went to No. 97, Hengmao Lane, to arrest A Wu Jin, but he was not there. They took down A Wu's half-length photograph hanging in the room. Then they went to the second-floor pavilion at No. 16 Baoyu Lane. It was already after midnight. Chen, every night using martial law, was weighing opium ash and opium to prepare to burn opium. The detectives took out the photograph obtained from Hengmao Lane and confirmed that it was A Wu Jin. Chen, Chen's wife, and the clerk A Zhao, were all arrested, along with the opium, opium ash, and opium equipment. They were taken to the police station to be detained and investigated.

### Guangsheng Gambling Den: Bomb Explodes

There is a Guangsheng gambling den in the area beyond the concessions in western Shanghai, with twenty-one gambling tables, and extremely large bets. It is located at the intersection of the branch road of Jessfield Road and Barrinan Road. The night before last, at about 9:00 PM, while the gamblers were enthusiastically betting heavily, suddenly more than 30 young men, each holding a Mauser pistol, grenades and other things, disguised as gamblers, mixed into the den. They immediately scattered to the gambling tables and pretended to place bets, but in reality, they were scouting the gambling situation. Therefore, most people did not notice. After a brief look, the men focused their attention on one of the tables in the middle with the largest winnings, pulled out a grenade from their sleeves and threw it next to the table. With a loud bang, the building shook and iron fragments flew everywhere. The gamblers and tea servers next to the table were the first to be hit, causing them to be wounded and bleeding. The gamblers at the other gambling tables, shocked by this, fled in all directions, causing some to be trampled and others to be crushed. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the grenade throwers leisurely escaped. After the incident, neighbors tried to send more than ten wounded people to the hospital for treatment. It is reported that four people, including tea server Zhang Musheng, were seriously injured and in critical condition. The Jing'an Temple Police Station nearby was only informed yesterday morning and has sent officers to investigate. After this incident, yesterday, the gambling dens in western Shanghai were deserted. Generally, gamblers were hesitant to move forward.

### According to the Confession of Bandits: Handguns Seized, Hidden in a Pile of Yellow Sand

Yesterday afternoon at about 4:00 PM, Chinese and Western detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station arrested two bandits on Jiaozhou Road: Du Longxing (also known as Du Ermazi) from Jiangbei and Chen Chenglong (also known as Yu Qing) from Haizhou. It was learned that they had two handguns hidden under a pile of yellow sand on Singapore Road. The detectives rushed to the spot and found two Browning handguns with serial numbers 46270 and 630932, one magazine, and ten bullets. They were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, said that the two defendants should be detained and investigated for crimes. The defendant Chen Chenglong had a gunshot wound on his right arm, etc. After Judge Liu Yugui interrogated them, he ordered that they be remanded in custody and the hearing was postponed for seven days.

### Escort Agencies Not Allowed to be Attached to Inns; Police Department Clearly Prohibits; Eighty to Ninety Escort Girls Arrested the Night Before Last

Previously, the Public Concession Police Authority, because of the proliferation of escort agencies in the concession, which inevitably had both good and bad, causing scandalous incidents, specially ordered a crackdown. Escort agencies must apply to the Public Works Department for a singer's license, and must be established in designated locations, and may no longer be attached to inns. Their members must not engage in actions related to morality. When the prohibition was first issued, all escort agencies temporarily disappeared, but over time, they became complacent, resulting in a situation of outward compliance but inward defiance. Although the escort agencies were all established in accordance with the locations designated by the Public Works Department, they mostly set up branch offices in various hotels and inns, and all the escort girls gathered in the branch offices. Their headquarters were just empty shells. This situation was detected by the Flower Duty Class of the Police Department, Western Detective Fang Te, and Hua San Dao Tou No. 1013. In order to implement the ban and punish those who were negligent in public orders, the day before yesterday evening, they led Chinese and Western detectives to raid various hotels. As a result, many branch offices of escort agencies were broken up, and a total of eighty to ninety escort girls were arrested. Except for a portion who paid bail and were released, those without money were detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Prohibition Court of the First Special Court. The presiding judge imposed appropriate punishments according to the Prohibition Fine Law.

### A Woman, Dissolute and Fond of Gambling, Lost Too Much and Died by Poison

Zheng Huifang, a woman from Chaoyang, Guangdong, who lived at No. 7, Yongyu Lane, Lafayette Road, French Concession, was twenty-two years old this year and had been betrothed to someone. Her father had passed away, but her mother was still alive. Her fiancé, Zheng Jiarong, was twenty-five years old this year. He used to work in a pawnshop in Hongkou. After August 13th, he lost his job and is now a checker at the Zhongnan Hotel. Because his family has some assets, they can still make a living in these extraordinary times. Unexpectedly, Huifang has recently become dissolute. She went gambling in Caojiadu in Western Shanghai, losing thousands of gold, and turned all the jewelry sent by her fiancé's family into nothing.

As a result, her nerves suddenly went wrong. On the 22nd at 8:30 AM, she left home without saying goodbye and went to the Ningfeng Inn, opposite the Great World in the French Concession, under the alias Xiao, and checked into room 56. She conceived the idea of ending her life and took poison that night. On the morning of the 23rd at 7:00 AM, her brother, Zheng Jiarong, was suspicious because Huifang had gone out the day before and had not returned all night. He went to the house of the Wang sisters at No. 5 Yuzhen Lane on the same road to inquire and learned that she had checked into the Ningxing Inn alone. When he inquired, Huifang had already

Fallen unconscious from poisoning.

Her brother did not yet know that she had been poisoned and mistakenly thought she had

Fallen ill. He immediately took her to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yuqiaqing Road for treatment. By the time she arrived at the hospital, she had already died. After the doctor diagnosed that she had committed suicide by poisoning, the hospital, as usual, reported to the Laozha Police Station and notified the French Police Station to send detectives to the hospital and the inn to investigate. The corpse was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall for an autopsy. Yesterday it was reported that Judge Wang Ren of the Second Special Court went to the Hall and confirmed that the deceased Zheng Huifang, also known as Xiao, had indeed committed suicide by poisoning. The corpse was claimed by her brother, Zheng Jiarong, with a guarantee.

Detectives found Xu Fogen and the Wang girl near the Refugee Shelter on Yanping Road one after another and took them to the police station together. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special District. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, elaborated on the case and requested a postponement.

When questioned, the defendant's statement was evasive, saying that the girl went to the hotel voluntarily and begged for forgiveness. Judge Liu Yugui ordered Xu Fogen to be remanded in custody, and Guiying was taken back by her father, Wang Baogen.

He reported to the police chief, who dispatched Chinese detective Zhang Peilan, along with officials from the Japanese Consulate and Japanese constables, to investigate the matter at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday.

### Ruilin Foreign Firm Cotton Warehouse Loses Value: 150 Bales of Cotton Burned

The No. 4 warehouse of the German-owned Ruilin Foreign Firm cotton warehouse at No. 287 Zhushui Lane, Xiaoshadu Road, Western Shanghai, suddenly caught fire at about 4:25 AM yesterday morning. Because cotton is not easy to put out once it catches fire, thick smoke immediately rose up and flames shot up. The Central Fire Brigade heard the alarm and rushed many belt cars to put out the fire. It was not until about 6:00 AM at dawn that the fire was extinguished. In addition to the entire No. 4 warehouse being burned, 150 bales of fly cotton stored by the Li Houji firm, valued at more than 3,000 yuan, were also burned. As for the cause of the fire, it was caused by a worker dropping a cigarette while loading the warehouse.

At around 10:10 AM yesterday morning, a certain Japanese store at No. 43 Hanbili Road, Hongkou, was not careful with fire, and smoke spread everywhere, immediately extending to the two neighboring houses at No. 41 and No. 45.

### French Concession Police Department Strictly Hunts Down Racketeers at the Wharf; Conniving in the Transportation of Opium Narcotics; Wanted and Still Not Captured

The head of the wharf racketeers and a major drug dealer, Xia Sibao, also known as Xiao Sibao, sold the narcotics morphine and heroin with funds provided by his wife, Zhang Caifeng. He connived in the transportation of opium soil at various wharves along the Bund of the French Concession, making a large profit. He was once wanted by the French Concession Police Department and the Jianghai Customs Water Police, but he has not yet been captured. It is now learned that Xia has changed his route because the French Police Department dispatched detectives to specifically investigate and crack down on opium and narcotics in the Bund area. He lands at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou and secretly transports the drugs and opium into the British and French Concessions by land for sale. It is said that the French police have sent detectives to guard the border day and night to investigate and crack down.

### Jews in Hongkou: Developing Commercial Talent; Opening Stores are Attractive; Japanese Businesses Inevitably Suffer a Major Blow

According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the Japanese-language Shanghai News stated the evening before last (22nd) that Jewish immigrants have established a "Kingdom" near the HSBC Bank in the Ritz Hotel because they have "special commercial talent." These immigrants may infringe upon the rights and interests of Japanese residents in Hongkou. Jewish immigrants have opened many stores on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, displaying goods that are quite attractive. Now the number of refugees from Germany and Austria has reached 9,000, and this year may exceed 20,000. These people do not idly stand by and lament their fate, but will expand their activities. The Japanese plan will be disrupted by them. Jewish immigrants are entering the north bank of Suzhou Creek one after another, and have now become a serious problem for Japanese residents. According to press reports, the rights and interests of Chinese and foreigners in Hongkou have been almost excluded, and the area is still under strict Japanese control. The rights and interests of foreigners outside Shanghai have suffered huge losses due to the overbearing actions of the Japanese army. Now even the "rights and interests" of the Japanese in Shanghai are threatened.

According to the North China Daily News,

A Japanese spokesperson, when meeting with reporters yesterday (23rd), took a firm stance on two issues. One was that the Japanese side did not intend to take measures to prevent the continuous flow of Jewish refugees, and said that this was not directly related to the Japanese side. The second was that foreign ships enjoying consular jurisdiction must obtain a permit before sailing from Shanghai to the occupied ports.

This regulation will be implemented from June 1st to prevent the transportation of confidential items from the occupied areas to the non-occupied areas. A reporter asked why this regulation applies to neutral ships. The response was also that the Japanese side would welcome the arrival of Jewish refugees if they could increase the commercial prosperity of this port. However, their value has not yet been

Clearly stated. The spokesperson replied to another inquiry that although immigration from Germany should be stopped, Japan does not intend to negotiate with Germany to stop issuing passports. Some asked if the "municipal government" has already taken over the Water Police Bureau, can it not prevent immigration?

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor,

I am writing on behalf of my client, Chuan Fengrong, who has stated that he has read a report in today's Shen Bao local news section about a lawsuit involving Fengrong and the dancer Lin Aina. Much of the content is inaccurate. The judge presiding over the trial that day only questioned Ms. Lin repeatedly on the points raised by Fengrong, and Ms. Lin's testimony was contradictory. The judge even reprimanded her to her face. Because the case was closed to the public, the newspaper reporter was unable to attend the court hearing. It seems to be based on only one side of the story. The record does not match. However, as it concerns Fengrong's reputation, please correct the record in a letter.

Sincerely,

Lawyer Wu Chuliang, May 24th.

### Finance: Cash Prices Have Fallen for Four Consecutive Days, with the Lowest Price Reaching the 2,100 Yuan Mark

Yesterday, the off-market situation for cash in this city saw an increasingly severe decline, with a downward trend that seemed difficult to stop. Prices broke through 2,110 yuan and continued to fall to a closing price of 2,100 yuan at the lowest level, a psychologically significant point. The market atmosphere was extremely weak, due to continuous heavy selling by securities firms and certain brokers acting on behalf of northern trading groups. Although gold shops engaged in both buying and selling, they were only interested in cheap prices. After forcefully buying 200 taels, money exchange businesses also switched to selling. There were rumors of Japanese parties selling to maintain and absorb Japanese yen, further weakening morale and causing prices to fall sharply by 12 yuan. This created a fatigue trend of four consecutive days of declines. Trading was not active, with a total volume of 500 taels. Jewelry gold was also marked down by 1 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold prices remained level.

Cash Prices Fall Again by 12 Yuan

From the morning, buyers initially called for 2,110 yuan per bar (10 taels). Suddenly, Defu Securities (representing a northern trading group) re-emerged, causing market sentiment to weaken. Buyers remained on the sidelines, causing prices to drop to within 10 yuan of the 2,110 mark. At around 10:00 AM, trading began, with securities firms and gold shops each selling 50 taels to another gold shop at a price of 2,107 yuan, 5 yuan lower than the opening price. Money exchange businesses suddenly made aggressive purchases, and the northern trading group ceased selling, causing prices to rebound. Jewelry shops sold 50 taels for 2,108 yuan, and gold shops and certain brokers also sold 50 taels each, rising to 2,109 yuan. All were purchased by money exchange businesses. At noon, there were rumors that certain brokers were also selling on behalf of the northern trading group, causing momentum to soften and prices to drop by 2 yuan. Gold shops sold another 50 taels to money exchange businesses. By noon closing, the price was 2,107 yuan. In the afternoon, the downward trend intensified. With the northern trading group continuing to sell heavily and money exchange businesses also reselling, the market opened more than 2 yuan lower at around 2:00 PM. Money exchange businesses sold 50 taels to gold shops for around 2,100 yuan. Later, buyers only offered 100 yuan, while the northern trading group limited sales to a minimum of 100 yuan. The two sides maintained their positions until 3:45 PM, when securities firms sold 100 taels to gold shops. The closing price was still 2,100 yuan, a sharp drop of 12 yuan compared to the previous day. Over the past four days, prices have fallen by a total of 29 yuan. On the same day, it was still difficult to rise, with fluctuations of 9 yuan. Cash gold shops sold at a listed price of 2,105 yuan and purchased at 2,095 yuan. Current bid gold purchases and sales were both 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and no trades were opened.

Jewelry Gold Marked Down by 1 Yuan

The exchange price for jewelry gold at jewelry stores was initially level. When cash prices fell to within 2,110 yuan, Hengfu immediately marked down 1 yuan to 214 yuan at 10:00 AM. When cash prices further retreated to 2,100 yuan, Datonghang also marked down 1 yuan to 214 yuan at 2:20 PM. Xintonghang followed, lowering the price to 212 yuan (purchases were all at 206 yuan).

Sino-British Pure Gold Prices Remain Stagnant

According to a London telegram on the 23rd, British pure gold prices remained stable, at £7 8s 5 1/2d per ounce. The central government's customs gold listing price remained at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard bid gold price was 1,207.2 yuan, and the Chinese pure gold purchase price remained at 1,211.9 yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Market Lacks Vitality, Leading to a Significant Reduction in Trading

The foreign exchange market was increasingly stagnant yesterday, lacking any excitement and remaining entirely rigid. Although oil companies such as Asiatic and other foreign companies made settlements, they continued to sell, and outside parties were also willing to sell. As a result, it was difficult to change the situation. Spot prices remained level, and trading was scarce in the morning. Although money exchange businesses switched from buying to selling Hong Kong dollars, banks bought them at low prices, resulting in no gains or losses.

In the early morning, London telegraphic transfers for both near and far terms narrowed by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained stable, and London bullion prices tended to stabilize. Exchange rates for British dollars against U.S. dollars were up by 6 mils, while rates against Shanghai and France were level. U.S. dollar rates against British dollars and Shanghai were also unchanged, while rates against France rose by 0.0625. The central government's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened spot selling prices at 8.25 for British exchange and 16.0625 for U.S. exchange, with no gains or losses compared to the previous close. After opening, Asiatic Petroleum Company came to settle spot British exchange with HSBC at 8.25. Other foreign companies also purchased HSBC's U.S. exchange for this month at 16.0625, making it difficult to change the situation. HSBC's listed exchange rates were unchanged, and the silver equilibrium tax was announced at 2.125%, calculated at 5.25%. At that time, China Bank sold August U.S. exchange to Huayi, an outside firm, for 15.875 yuan, and market sentiment was also flat. Subsequently, trading became scarce, leading to an increasingly depressed market and stagnant prices. At noon, the Dutch branch of the outside firm absorbed Hong Kong dollar spot from money exchange businesses for 55.25 yuan, and the situation was also quite stable. By the noon closing, banks' spot selling prices were 8.25 for British exchange and 16.0625 for U.S. exchange, resulting in no change compared to the previous evening's close. Futures prices also remained unchanged. The final bank selling price for Hong Kong dollars was 55.125 yuan, also remaining level. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.

### Japanese Currency Rises Rapidly, While British and American Gold Pounds Fall Sharply and Continuously

Yesterday, British pure gold prices remained unchanged. British and American exchange rates rose by 0.125. Foreign exchange settlements by foreign firms in this city were not strong, and bank settlements were very smooth. Market prices remained stable. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. When cash opened, all shops were eager to sell, making the market situation increasingly weak. Although money exchange businesses absorbed some, changes were very limited, with no progress. In the afternoon, gold shops resumed selling, with few buyers, further weakening the market. As a result, prices fell significantly compared to the previous day. Over the past three days of this week, prices have fallen by 20 yuan. Due to the impact of falling cash prices, British and American gold pounds were mostly sold, demand decreased, and prices fell sharply. British and American gold notes were in equilibrium between supply and demand, and trading was still strong. Hong Kong dollar notes were in fairly equal supply and demand, and the situation was stable. Demand for French franc notes had decreased, and prices continued to fall. Demand for Canadian dollar notes and Italian lira notes had slightly increased, and prices were slightly firm. There were no sales of German gold notes, and prices fell sharply again. This gold note is different from the controlled gold mark and has no way out. From the morning, Japanese gold notes and Korean won notes gradually rose. Initially, Japanese gold notes were 0.912 cents, and Korean won notes were 0.81 yuan. By 6:00 PM, Japanese gold notes were over 0.94 yuan, and Korean won notes were 0.833 yuan. Wholesale sales in the market were scarce, and retail purchases were strong. It was heard that one party had locked up Japanese currency and refused to release it, raising market prices. However, with demand for legal tender already established and abundant sources, it may still be difficult to achieve its intended outcome, even with great efforts. There were no public association transactions. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds each fell by 0.3 yuan, French franc notes fell by 0.25 yuan, Canadian dollar notes and Italian lira notes each rose by 0.05 yuan, Australian gold notes fell by 0.1 yuan, and all other currencies remained unchanged.

### British and Indian Silver Prices Decline Again

According to a London telegram on the 23rd, silver market speculators were engaged in both buying and selling. India made purchases at listed prices, and the market was level. After closing, the market was level but slightly firm. Buyers paid listed prices, but sellers required an additional 0.0625. Telegraphic transfers for both near and far terms narrowed by 0.0625. According to a New York silver telegram, U.S. spot prices remained unchanged. According to a Bombay telegram, the Indian silver market was calm, with spot and June prices each falling by 1 anna. July prices remained unchanged.

### "Federal Reserve Notes" Rebound Slightly After Falling

According to a Tianjin telegram on the 24th, the off-market price of "Federal Reserve Notes" rose by 1 yuan compared to the opening price on the morning of the 23rd. 100 yuan in legal tender could buy 121.75 yuan in "Federal Reserve Notes," meaning that 1 yuan in "Federal Reserve Notes" was worth 0.821355236 yuan in legal tender.

### Tianjin Shanghai Exchange Rates Continue to Rise

—Hong Kong and Shanghai Stable—

According to a Tianjin telegram on the 24th, exchange rates were unchanged compared to the previous day. Only Shanghai exchange rates continued to rise slightly by 0.25 yuan. The opening prices are listed below:

(Shanghai Exchange represents the amount Tianjin should receive for 100 yuan in legal tender in Shanghai. Also, on the 22nd and 23rd, Shanghai exchange rates rose by 0.5 yuan. The previous report mistakenly stated that prices had fallen. This is now corrected.)

According to a Hong Kong telegram on the 24th, the opening prices for British, American, and Shanghai exchange rates were the same as the prices at 2:30 PM on the 23rd. By the morning close, British exchange rates had narrowed slightly by 0.03125, to a price of 1s 2.875d. U.S. exchange rates also narrowed by 0.0625, to a price of 29 yuan. There was no market after 3:00 PM. The opening prices are listed below:

(Shanghai Exchange represents the amount in Shanghai legal tender for 100 yuan in Hong Kong dollars.)

### Discount Rates Fluctuate

Yesterday, the discount rate for bank-accepted drafts was still fluctuating. The rate fell to 49.5 yuan per 1,000 yuan in the morning, but suddenly rose to 50 yuan in the afternoon. However, the final rate was 49.75 yuan, the same as the previous day. The interbank call loan rate remained unchanged at 0.1 yuan.

### Securities Foreign Stocks Active, Bonds Slightly Weaker

Yesterday, the trend in securities gray market rebounded from weakness to strength. All rumors dissipated, and confidence returned. Generally, short sellers, facing unsettled times and considerable market prices, covered their positions on slight dips, further strengthening prices. With dividend payments approaching, shorting opportunities dwindled. While no major bullish surges were expected, the gradual rise unnerved short sellers. Initially, selling by Tong Kang De Fu and others led to some weakness, but strong buying by Tian Sheng Da Feng and absorption by Heng Fu, Lian He, and Da Tong led to a recovery. In the afternoon, Da Feng and Tian Sheng continued buying, with Run Li Xing Yuan and No. 25 also absorbing shares. On the selling side, only Tong Kang had some long positions to unload, with Yong Kang Yu Ji making slight sales. Demand exceeded supply, gradually boosting prices. Closing prices exceeded the previous day's by one or two jiao. Total turnover exceeded 600,000 yuan. A summary is provided below.

Stock trading was quite slow. Han Ye Ping shares, long inactive, saw a transaction of over 70 shares at a price of 2.20 yuan.

Trading at the Public Exchange was not brisk. However, market sentiment seemed to improve for tram shares at 39.50 yuan and land reclamation shares at 8.05 yuan. Kai Ping shares stabilized at 29 yuan. Jardine shares stood at 37 yuan. Yi He shares were slightly better, closing with stable bids at 18.70 yuan and offers at 18.80 yuan. The corporate bond market was stable, with 5.5% electricity bonds trading at 88.50 yuan. The rubber market was quiet. Overseas rubber raw material prices continued to strengthen, gradually rising back to pre-Czech crisis levels.

London British Far East Companies' Stock Market Prices on the 23rd of this month (Tuesday): Kai Ping Coal Mines unregistered shares were firm, rising by four and a half pence to 20 shillings. There were no other changes.

London China Foreign Debt Market Prices on the 23rd of this month (Tuesday): Generally, conditions were calm with minimal fluctuations in prices. However, British and French treasury bills, which were expected to fall to £57, rebounded by £3 3s. 15d. to £60 15s., only slightly below last week's high of 9s. London spot offers remained for £10,000 of Tianjin-Pukou Railway original loan British-issued drawn bonds at a price of £18 5s., 5s. above the market. Reconstruction Loan French-issued stamped bonds were offered at £50 10s., £2 below the British-issued listed price. Russian-issued stamped bonds were bid at £46 10s. and offered at £46 15s., £5 15s. below the British-issued listed price.

### Yarn & Cotton Business in 20-Count Yarn, Speculation Mixed In. Those with gate tickets for spot goods are even selling off at low prices on the market.

The yarn market was weak in the morning but firm in the afternoon, with the overall situation increasingly uncertain. Actual sales were strong. However, the majority of purchases were of 32-count single yarn and 10-count coarse yarn by Fujian and Hong Kong traders. Business in 20-count yarn was still acceptable, but speculative trading exceeded genuine transactions several times over. Therefore, the market was unusually tight, with most adopting a buy-and-sell strategy. In contrast, Japanese yarn remained weak. In the afternoon, it was rumored that Hong Kong traders bought 700 bales of coarse and fine yarn, reviving confidence. A certain yarn house slightly bought back several dozen bales of its own warehouse receipts, and the market rose by more than one yuan. In addition, wealthy stockholders hoarded their holdings, keeping prices firm.

The spot yarn market was initially weak in the morning. Customer interest in 20-count yarn was not strong, but inquiries for 32-count single yarn were constant. However, spot goods were scarce and prices were high. The asking price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell by 1.50 yuan, with foreign warehouse prices at 427 yuan and warehouse receipt prices at 421 yuan. On the other hand, 32-count single yarn remained buoyant. Shortly after, those with gate tickets for spot goods, to avoid the hassle of transferring through warehouses, sold off at low prices of only 425 yuan. This dampened sentiment, and with actual demand not strong, prices fell by one or two yuan, with warehouse receipt prices at 410 yuan and foreign warehouse spot goods at 426 yuan. The market closed flat. Afternoon opening prices remained flat, maintaining the morning's closing price. Subsequently, some buying led to a market rebound of more than one yuan. At closing, the spot price for 20-count "Double Horse" yarn was 428.50 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 421 yuan. In total, traders bought 2,160 bales throughout the day. Market prices for "Double Horse" fell by 0.50 yuan, "Angel" fell by 2.50 yuan, and "Double Globe" fell by 4 yuan. "Shepherd" remained unchanged. 32-count yarn rose by 3 yuan. Shen Xin Factory offered 300 bales of 32-count "Angel" yarn at 575 yuan, with a deposit of 50 yuan per bale for June-July delivery. An Da Factory offered 50 bales of 32-count "Flying Tiger" yarn at 540 yuan. Shipments today included 45 bales of cotton yarn to Tianjin, 30 bales to Yantai, 480 bales to Shantou, and 15 bales to Hong Kong. The breakdown of purchases by various traders is as follows:

Fellow Traders: 1170 Shantou: 290
Hong Kong: 670
Inland: 30

Total: 2160

The Japanese yarn market remained volatile due to weak sales, primarily driven by speculative trading. Speculators sold short when prices rose and bought low when prices fell to profit. As a result, the closing price for 20-count "Moon Harp" yarn for the current month was still 355 yuan, similar to the previous day.

### Domestic Cotton Interrupted, Grade A Cotton Approaching the 80 Yuan Mark, Release of American Loan Cotton Not Far Off, Indian Cotton Flooding In, Warehouses Unable to Accommodate

Domestic cotton business showed slight improvement. Da Kang Japanese Factory purchased 400 bales of American upland cotton (foreign frame), selecting for its clean color and blending it with Indian cotton for spinning. However, fellow traders remained active in Indian cotton trading, likely due to the interruption of domestic cotton supply, shifting to foreign cotton transactions. Domestic cotton prices remained tight and continued to advance. Grade A cotton sold for 79.50 yuan, approaching the 80 yuan mark. Supplies from Northern Jiangsu were relatively smooth, but volumes were still small, and transportation costs were likely not cheap. Arrivals at the docks included 310 bales of Tongzhou downstream cotton and 425 bales of wooden frame cotton. Current cotton market conditions are recorded as follows:

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was quite sluggish, but Liverpool news brought good tidings, leading to a slight increase of one or two pounds. Although there was no definite news from Washington, all traders deeply believed that the release of loan cotton was not far off. Therefore, traders adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, Indian cotton predictions fell again by two rupees, while Egyptian cotton rose by eight pounds. Converted to legal currency, American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose by 0.10 yuan, Indian cotton fell by 0.05 yuan, and Egyptian cotton rose by 0.05 yuan.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Previously, Indian cotton transportation was difficult, but after various efforts, four additional special ships were added. Recently, these ships arrived in succession, causing severe congestion. Ships could not dock at the wharves, and warehouses could not accommodate the influx. Most of the cotton was unloaded onto barges, making it difficult for manufacturers to pick up their goods. This demonstrates the sheer volume of arrivals. Because of the congestion, manufacturers were less active in purchasing foreign cotton, leading to quiet trading throughout the day. Yesterday's cotton market prices converted to factory delivery prices are as follows:

### Grains Animal Feed Powder Active Sales to Northern Traders, Tianjin Traders Transacted 30,000 Bags

Factory Powder

Yesterday, the powder market remained flat as sales to both northern and southern regions were scattered. In the northern region, tens of thousands of bags of foreign flour were being prepared for shipment, making continuous demand for factory powder difficult. However, there was still demand for animal feed powder. It was reported that northern traders added only a few thousand bags of brand No. 2 powder with vehicle and boat tags, but 30,000 bags of animal feed powder in white bags No. 5 were transacted at a price of 3.50 yuan. Other scattered transactions by southern traders and inland traders within the city totaled only 14,000 to 15,000 bags. The overall asking price for No. 2 powder was 0.40 yuan in cash and 0.60 yuan by wire transfer. However, there were rumors of a depreciation of 0.05 yuan for returned mixed-brand powder, and the market was still brewing.

Foreign Flour

Yesterday's market was particularly weak. While foreign prices were difficult to reconcile, futures flour continued to arrive. It was reported that over 100,000 bags would arrive in Shanghai on June 1st, and Tianjin traders were already saturated. Other scattered traders showed no enthusiastic interest. Overall market transactions were limited to a few thousand bags within the city. Selling prices were temporarily stable, with potential for further concessions for bulk purchases. The market was also brewing.

Exports

Today, 10,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin and 4,000 bags to Shantou.

### Rice Market Oversupplied, Japonica and Indica Prices Slightly Down by Two or Three Jiao

Du Japonica: Yesterday, river sources from various traders totaled nearly 10 boats to Songjiang and Nangang. Wagon packages of Suzhou, Tongkun, and others totaled over 4,000 bags. After a previous rebound, the market opened weaker today due to abundant arrivals, dampening sentiment. Sales within the city were sluggish, and some hoarders were selling off, creating an oversupply. This made it difficult for thick and thin Japonica to maintain its footing, leading to a decline of one or two jiao. Du Yang, Jianbu, and Jianjian were further constrained by customer preferences, falling by varying amounts of two or three jiao. Customer arrivals continued to surge, sales stagnated, and the market continued to decline, with a significant drop of three jiao. Glutinous rice was still affected by foreign glutinous rice, continuing to fall by two or three jiao.

Customer Indica: Yesterday, wholesalers and hoarders competed to unload their holdings, further weakening the market. Sales were limited to scattered transactions within the city. The market saw only 2,000 bags transacted, while arrivals from Japan continued, attracted by the previous high prices. In the past two or three days, arrivals by Yangtze River boats reached 30,000 bags, resulting in high inventories and slow consumption. The market saw another sharp drop of two or three jiao. Wuhu machine rice was also pressured by local glutinous rice, falling two or three jiao along with glutinous rice and rice husks. Saigon spot foreign rice also followed with a slight drop of one or two jiao. However, according to telegrams from foreign firms, Saigon selling prices rose on the same day, so firm orders were not heard of.

Also reported that 150 bags of rice were shipped from Hong Kong yesterday.

### Textiles Zhejiang, Anhui, and Chaozhou Cloth Sales Are All Strong, Eastern White Goods Turn Weak

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday, white goods, coarse cloth, and fine cloth markets were firm, driven by continued strong demand from Zhejiang, Anhui, and Chaozhou traders, allowing traders to gradually clear their inventories, and manufacturers maintained high prices. Da Peng fine cloth rose by 0.05 yuan per bolt due to a lack of spot goods. Yi He coarse cloth rose by 0.05 yuan per bolt after the sale of cheap inventories. However, Hua Factory's 9-pound and 11-pound cloth fell by 0.05 to 0.10 yuan per bolt due to weak demand within the city. Prices for bleached and dyed fabrics showed even greater discrepancies, with a weak market. Demand from Sichuan and Yunnan traders was largely stagnant, and demand from Tianjin traders in the north had also recently declined. British Lun Chang Factory experienced a labor strike, temporarily halting production. However, existing inventory sales remained sluggish, with trader inventories cheaper than factory prices by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan. Yi He Factory's bleaching and dyeing department launched new "Whirlwind" starch bleached cloth, selling over 70 cases to wholesale dealers in the city at a price of 12.70 yuan per bolt. Wenzhou traders continued to purchase over 300 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, striped bleached cloth, bleached cloth, and palace silk for resale in Zhejiang and Anhui inland areas. Subei, Yancheng, and Funing added over 2,000 bolts of colored cloth, fine cloth, coarse twill, and popular light-colored fabrics. Shantou traders continued to purchase over 100 cases of colored twill, colored cloth, and palace silk.

Eastern Textiles

White goods gradually weakened due to continued sluggish sales. Yesterday, fine cloth and fine twill saw little business, relying only on inter-dealer and dye factory transactions of 600 to 700 pieces. Fine cloth fell back by 0.10 to 0.15 yuan per bolt. Spot goods for "Dragon Head" were only 13.40 yuan. Fine twill was more stable due to decent sales of dyed material, falling by about 0.05 yuan per bolt.

Exports

Textile exports on the 25th: 30 pieces to Tianjin, 10 pieces to Yantai, 10 pieces to Hong Kong, and 200 pieces to Shantou.

### Silk and Tea Shanghai Silk Trading Quiet, Foreign Silk Squeezing Spot Market Significantly

Foreign silk markets showed a clear squeeze on the spot market. Judging from the slight decline in forward thread silk prices and the scarcity of actual sales transactions, the sudden surge in Yokohama and New York prices the other day seemed to have no profound effect. Yesterday, Yokohama silk prices were unchanged for spot goods but fell 7 yuan for forward contracts, falling another 5 yuan in the afternoon. New York prices fell slightly by 0.02 yuan for near-term contracts and 0.015 yuan for distant contracts. Spot market prices fell slightly by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan. Daily silk sales were only 350 piculs. Lyon market prices for Chinese and Japanese raw silk each rose by 0.50 to 1 franc. However, there seemed to be a saturation point for Shanghai silk trading.

Local transactions turned quiet. Sales of White Factory's 7-8 point American goods remained stalled. The asking price was 1,870 yuan, and industry insiders considered it to have little hope. French firm sales had been active for several days, but yesterday also seemed to reach a saturation point. British and French trading houses lowered their limit prices by 10 yuan. Yesterday, 20 piculs were transacted. Indian trading houses continued to see brisk sales of Lower Ganji Lee goods, with the Jinma grade priced at 860 yuan. Another 20+ lots were transacted. Silk prices were expected to rise.

On the 22nd, 432 cases of rayon arrived from Italy. Exports on the 23rd included 244 pieces of Hangzhou silk to Europe and 151 tons of tea to Spain. On the 25th, another 158 cases of tea were shipped to Hong Kong.

### New Green Tea Suddenly Soars

In the past two days, new teas from Huzhou and Hangzhou have been arriving in Shanghai in succession. Consequently, over 40 local tea firms and tea factories in the city have all started operations. British companies like Xie He, Bao Chang, and Tian Yu, as well as Chinese tea companies like China Tea Company, have all been actively purchasing, and the market is gradually expanding. Yesterday, the Gong Sheng, Yong Zhong, and Xin Chang tea warehouses sold a total of over 470 cases of various Zhen Mei green teas, including top-grade and ordinary grades. Top-grade teas opened at 265 yuan, and ordinary Zhen Mei also opened at 216 yuan, a sudden increase of 10 to 20 yuan compared to last week. Tea merchants, aware of the limited supply from Ningbo and Wenzhou, were generally inclined to sell their existing stock at a good price.

### Miscellaneous Grains Yellow Soybeans Sluggish

Yellow soybeans struggled to rally due to sluggish sales and frequent price cuts. Furthermore, the repeated depreciation of the Japanese yen might open the door for control over Dalian soybeans, causing anxiety and discouraging traders. Yesterday, the overall market saw one truckload of Dalian beans open at 8.50 yuan, one truckload of Xicheng beans also open at 8.50 yuan, and 300 bags of Wuhu beans transacted at 8.70 yuan. Sales were limited to the city. There were also 100 bags of Bengbu beans from the previous night that transacted at 8.20 yuan.

On the 24th, 280 bags of soybeans arrived from Tianjin. Exports on the 23rd included 34 tons of soybeans to Bombay and 22 tons to Columbus.

On the 28th, 2,800 pieces of sesame oil arrived from Qingdao and 200 pieces of soybean oil from Tianjin.

### Sugar Market Expected to See Little Fluctuation

According to the London telegram yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight decline in near-term prices but a rise of 1 to 1.5 pence in distant prices. August was at 6 shillings 10 and 3/4 pence, December at 6 shillings 2 pence, and March of next year at 6 shillings 2 pence. Holland and Hong Kong were unchanged. The local market trend was flat. The Guild's prices were lower by a small jiao for spot No. 24 coarse white sugar, with local warehouses at 27.10 yuan, Da Jin Qian brand at 27.40 yuan, foreign warehouses at 26.90 yuan, and customs warehouses at 18.80 yuan, with no fluctuations. Goods in transit expected to arrive on June 13th were at 19 yuan for 200 bags, with no other significant changes. Domestic sugar only offered ordinary crystal flower white sugar at 23.30 yuan and Chongqi white sugar at 19 yuan, totaling less than 100 bags. Also arriving in Shanghai yesterday were 40 bags of sugar from Shantou.

### North-South Goods Raw Peanuts Price Rebounds

According to Qingdao reports, the price of raw peanuts rebounded as sales to foreign firms revived. Southwest peanuts rose to 16.20 yuan, East peanuts to 16.40 yuan, and large peanuts to 16.50 yuan, with a total of 8,100 bags transacted. Peanut kernels from Taiwan were priced at 13 yuan but not transacted. Local refined peanut kernels were priced at 20.50 yuan, and foreign refined peanut kernels at 22 yuan. The market might ease in the future.

### Medicinal Materials New Amoy Gardenia Continues to Weaken

Amoy gardenia had seen soaring prices due to buying from northern traders and a shortage of old stocks. However, with the recent continuous arrival of new goods and reports of a bountiful harvest this year, dealers were eager to sell. While new goods had previously sold for 31 yuan, recent offers from traders were only 24 to 25 yuan, and sales had weakened.

### Seafood Domestic Dried Scallops Opened for Sale Yesterday

The first batch of new Yantai dried scallops had arrived in Shanghai and opened for sale yesterday at a price of 270 yuan. Considering the prevalence of inferior goods in the market and sluggish sales, subsequent arrivals were expected to decline in price.

### Agar-Agar Sales Scattered

The agar-agar market had ample inventory, with sales mostly scattered. Current market prices were 26 yuan for lion's mane agar-agar, 22 yuan for Xilan agar-agar, 19.50 yuan for dragon's tooth agar-agar, and 19 yuan for Wudun agar-agar, with stable market conditions.

### Coal Anthracite from Hongji Short Supply, High Prices

Due to the prolonged scarcity of Hongji anthracite and thin market inventory, sellers stubbornly held onto high prices, leading to another increase. However, dealers in the city were forced to slightly replenish their stocks to meet market demand. Currently, only De Wei Foreign Firm had inventory, with a small amount offered for sale. Dealer inventories were offered at 45 yuan per ton for No. 1 anthracite (the same price as lump coal) and 43 yuan for Henan anthracite, cash transactions, with delivery charges added at discretion.

### Hollywood Twelve Beautiful and Glamorous Movie Stars (Part 1)
— Fang Yao

Recently, a very famous magazine in the Far East selected twelve beautiful and glamorous movie stars from Hollywood. They are: Deanna Durbin, Shirley Temple, Loretta Young, Olivia de Havilland, Myrna Loy, Ann Sheridan, Jane Wyatt, Bette Davis, Ginger Rogers, Dea Durbin, Annabella, and Louise Rainer.

Reportedly, the selection criteria were based equally on technical skill and beauty. However, child stars and younger actresses were somewhat advantaged.

The magazine provided brief and clear introductions for each of these twelve glamorous and beautiful stars. I will translate them as follows:

Deanna Durbin A young girl with limitless potential, she is only sixteen years old this year. She has a clever and melodious voice, brown hair with golden highlights, a smile as beautiful as a newly bloomed rose, and lively, sparkling eyes. She is now the pillar of the new Universal Pictures. Her recent work is "Three Smart Girls Grow Up" (Note: This refers to "Three Smart Girls"), where the main actresses were the three girls from "One Hundred Men and a Girl."

Shirley Temple Although she is already an eleven-year-old child, she is even more innocent and lively than before the age of eight. Last May, she traveled to various states in the eastern United States, and President Roosevelt specially summoned her for a conversation and praised her. Her first Technicolor film is called "The Little Princess," and the plot is very tightly woven, currently being released in American cinemas.

Loretta Young A twenty-three-year-old glamorous beauty. She is now the pillar of 20th Century Fox. Her eyes are the most powerful. Many American artists say that Loretta Young's eyes are the most beautiful among actresses. In the past, she had a "trial marriage" with Grant Withers, the son of a wealthy New York businessman, but they separated due to differences. Last year, she had a passionate affair with Tyrone Power, which also ended without result. Tyrone Power has now married Annabella. After these two setbacks, Loretta Young has vowed not to fall in love and to devote herself to her film career.

Olivia de Havilland Twenty-four years old this year, weighing 105 pounds, she has captivating brown eyes. On the set, she is nicknamed "Squirrel." She was personally promoted by the great European director Max Reinhardt. She is the pillar of Warner Bros. Her famous works include "Anthony Adverse," "The Story of Louis Pasteur," "The Prince and the Pauper," and "The Adventures of Robin Hood."

Myrna Loy A thirty-four-year-old actress who is the typical "virtuous wife" type. Her "black lacquer bench" is the famous director William Powell. She originally studied sculpture, and her entry into the film industry was quite serendipitous. It is said that "screen heartthrob" Valentino met her in Hollywood and, because she possessed great femininity, encouraged her to make movies. Out of curiosity, she followed his advice and decided to try it, unexpectedly becoming famous.

(The full text is not finished. Tomorrow we will publish brief biographies and anecdotes of Ann Sheridan, Jane Wyatt, Bette Davis, Ginger Rogers, Dea Durbin, Annabella, and Louise Rainer.)

### Records of the Pear Garden in the Old Capital

— Yan Yan

Zhang Junqiu, one of the four famous small Dan actors, will soon perform "The Red Detachment of Women." Zhao Dexun (a student at the opera school) is currently helping him practice the martial arts scenes, and Wang Yaoqing is providing guidance on everything. When it is performed in the future, the results should be satisfactory.

Pu Dong, a famous figure in the ticket world residing in Hongdouguan, has retired to Shanghai, enjoying a carefree life. His daughter is marrying a Mr. Zhao, and the wedding will take place on the 28th of this month. There is sure to be a grand occasion. When asked, Mr. Pu Dong did not plan to return to Beijing to preside over the wedding.

The veteran actress Zhu Ruxiang, a large-voiced Hua Shan singer, is getting older. In addition to still teaching opera, she has decided to abandon Hua Shan performances and switch to Lao Dan (old female roles). She is currently preparing.

Huang Yulin, the former Shanghai-renowned Green Peony, performs in the old capital and is still welcomed. On the tenth of the month, she performed the new opera "Feng Yu Pei" at the Chang'an Theater, and tickets were pre-sold out, an unprecedented scene.

Li Debin, a graduate of the opera school specializing in Xiaosheng (young male roles), is participating in five troupes simultaneously and is extremely popular. Among them, his participation in the Qing Sheng Society and partnering with Gou Lingxiang are the most impressive.

Li Shifang, one of the four famous small Dan actors, has gradually recovered since his voice became ill. Although plans to form a troupe have been brewing for a long time, he has not dared to actively proceed. Now there is talk of collaborating with Tan Fuying.

Hou Yulan, a female student at the Beijing Opera School, immediately joined Xi Xiaobo's troupe for her first troupe engagement last month, collaborating with him in "Red Mane Stallion," with very satisfactory results.

Since Jin Shaoshan achieved great success in Beijing, Hao Shouchun has been determined not to make a living as an opera performer. However, to support a friend, he specially performed "Battle of Wancheng" at the Jixiang Theater on the 14th of this month, playing Cao Cao, Xiaocuihua playing Zou, and Yang Shengchun playing Zhang Xiu, a great event for the time.

Today, the trend of performing old operas is prevalent in Beijing. Ma Lianliang, Cheng Yanqiu, Xi Xiaobo, Tan Fuying, and others are all striving to promote old operas, and Li Wanchun also has a tendency to change his style.

Shang Xiaoyun, the organizer of the Rongchun Society opera training class, spares no effort in arranging new plays. Recently, they also publicly performed "Three Probes into Wolong Cave, Intelligent Capture of Beihu Prefecture," a play taken from "Heroes of the Sui and Tang Dynasties," using Mongolian costumes and desert scenery as a selling point.

### Anecdotes from the Entertainment World

The Queen's Theater is now leased and operated by Hong Qingxu, performing Chaozhou opera. The old San Zheng Shun Xiang Troupe has been successfully invited and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the Dasheng Steamer at 10 AM today. The theater once invited the Peony National Opera Troupe to perform Peking Opera as a transition, but that has now been abandoned.

Several film companies are scheduled to shoot the "Wen Su Chen" film on May 30th and officially begin filming on June 1st. The role of Wen Su Chen has been assigned to Liu Qiong.

Zhang Fupeng, the Monkey King of the Datian Stage, has begun to prepare for the thirty-fifth "Journey to the West" show. The program has been set as "Fighting Buddha Magic, Luring Lions at Shizi Ridge, Stealing Treasures and Subduing Dragons in Hidden Dragon Cave."

The Tianchan Stage will establish the Tianchan Box Office, with Gu Naigen, Zhang Boming, Fu Rushan, Gu Futang, and Zhao Ruizhang as preparatory members. A draft organizational outline has been drawn up, and members will be publicly solicited as soon as it is ready.

The Shenyang Commercial District Grand Stage has invited the Lin Shusen Troupe to succeed Li Wanchun's troupe.

The famous actor Xiao San Mazi declined invitations from Nanjing and Qingdao. This gentleman truly has backbone.

There are rumors of a reorganization of the Sincere Company's Paradise Amusement Park.

### Random Notes After Watching "Lin Chong's Revenge on a Snowy Night"

"Lin Chong's Revenge on a Snowy Night" premiered at the New Guangda Theater yesterday. Lin Chong, a hero from *Water Margin*, fights against a dark and evil environment, sweeping away demons and evil influences. It is a stimulating script that is suitable for the current era. The entire play is in a state of tension from beginning to end. Li Hong fully demonstrated her acting talent in this film. In the scene of saying goodbye at the hotel, when Lin Chong wrote the divorce letter, Zhenniang's heart was cut like a knife, and she fainted from crying. The sincerity of her expression moved the audience to tears of sympathy.

When the grass storehouse was burned down and blood splattered in the mountain temple, when Lin Chong killed his enemies with his own hands, the resentment pent up in the audience's hearts was like taking a refreshing medicine. It vanished, and their spirits were refreshed.

In the final scene, with the grass storehouse as the background, the wind was roaring and snow was flying. The fire in the grass storehouse burned more and more fiercely. The firelight reflected Lin Chong in the wind and snow, and his face showed his inner anger. He could no longer endure it. He wanted to avenge his hatred and seek revenge for the oppressed common people of the world. Carrying his spear and taking heavy steps, he left deep footprints in the snow. His figure gradually disappeared into the swirling snowstorm, which resembled a silver dragon.

### Theater Scene News

Sunday is a day for rest and entertainment for all sectors of society. The Shanghai Drama Arts Society is able to provide high-quality entertainment, which is truly a blessing for the people of Shanghai. This Sunday, the tenth performance will be jointly presented by the Gonghua Opera Troupe and the Shenzhou Evening School. The repertoire includes the spoken drama "Dumb Wife" and the improved Peking opera "Lu Wenlong." The troupe has been actively rehearsing recently, and the performance is sure to be a hit.

The New Drama Society's Experimental Theater will hold a Sunday matinee performance at the Carlton Theater at the end of this month and the beginning of next month, presenting Molière's two great plays: "Tartuffe" and "The Miser," directed by Yue Feng and Lü Gang respectively. Both plays have been adapted into scripts with Chinese flavor, so they have a profound meaning of metaphorical reality, it is said.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Ten Talented Students Nurtured by Public Funds

At that time, Cao Xinquan, an old gentleman, was appointed as the director of the Opera Department. Cao was a famous Kunqu opera artist, the father of the famous clown Cao Ergeng, and had served as the director of music law at the State Council's Bureau of Rites. Others, such as Zhang Rongkui, Guo Jixiang (i.e., Old Narcissus), Guo Chunshan, Wang Rongshan (i.e., the Qilin Boy of yesteryear), Lü Peifang, and Wen Liangchen, were all teachers specializing in opera courses. The school admitted both male and female students. In addition to learning opera every day, the school also taught them Chinese language, history, English, and French, and paid great attention to civics and martial arts.

The format of the guarantee and volunteer forms established by the school was also written in imitation of the phrases used in old-style opera schools. The general meaning is as follows:

Guarantor: I am now willing to send my own son/daughter to the

Opera Department of the Chinese Opera Vocational School to study the art of the Pear Garden. It is agreed that the term is ten years. Within the term, I will absolutely not withdraw from school midway; otherwise, I will be punished according to the school's rules. I am also willing to strictly abide by all school rules. All property obtained from the school's performances belongs to the school and has nothing to do with the surname. After joining the school, I will obey the teachings of the school and teachers. I am not allowed to ask for leave to go home. If I must ask for leave, the guarantor will be responsible for it temporarily. The school is not responsible for suicide in the school. If I run away privately, my family will find me and send me back. Natural disasters and illnesses are all up to fate. If I do not want to leave the school after graduation, other regulations will be made. The above is all true and without objection. To prevent verbal claims from being unreliable, this guarantee is made as evidence.

Guarantor: Signature and seal

The occupation, age, and address of the guarantor and introducer must be filled in below.

Such semi-new and semi-old guarantee forms (the wording of the volunteer forms is similar, but they are signed by the students) are rare in ordinary schools at all levels. The phrases "suicide," "running away," and "if I do not want to leave the school after graduation, other regulations will be made" are not found in ordinary schools. The reason why the Chinese Opera Vocational School insists on writing it this way is that although the school is named a school, it is actually a variation of the old-style opera school. However, it pays more attention to hygiene and cleanliness, and the equipment is in the style of a school. Old-style opera schools only studied opera. This school adds courses such as Chinese, English, history, and geography, which is much higher than the illiterate disciples in previous opera schools. In the past, apprentices suffered abuse from teachers. If they were not careful, they would be whipped. It is commonly said that "opera singers are beaten," and indeed opera singers are beaten into shape — (20) —

Rehashing Old News Sixty-seven Years Ago (1939)

(From the May issue of this newspaper in the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the deposed Qing dynasty)

### Business in Shanghai's North Market

It is widely said that all money shops in the North Market are making profits, with the highest profits exceeding ten thousand, or seven or eight thousand, and the lowest being no less than three or five thousand. Therefore, this year there are many money shops, with thirteen new ones opening. The profits of the money shops show that the business of the various trading houses is good, as one can easily infer. However, upon closer investigation, it turns out to be quite different; last year, not only did the trading houses not make profits, but they actually suffered losses, with the biggest losses suffered by the Jian, Guang, and Chao gangs. As for the green tea business, only the Hui region is still doing well. The Ping Shui tea is determined to be inferior, and the black tea is very poor. The sundry goods business is generally losing money. The earthwork business is also just average. Why is this? Because the merchants' capital is not large, and they owe too much money to the money shops, so the money shops can collect their profits; and the money shops' interest rates must also be excessively high. Merchants cannot make money and have to pay high interest rates, so how can they not be in debt? It is appropriate for the money shops to make profits. This is only according to the North Market.

### Arson at the Yuhang County Hall

The arson at the Yuhang County Hall is truly strange. The Yuhang County Hall is located in a remote area, although it is in the city, it is no different from being outside the city. At that time, Magistrate Liu had not yet returned from his promotion in the province. Suddenly, a few days ago in the evening, it was rumored that the county office was on fire. It turned out that the night watchman, in his sleep, suddenly heard the sound of firecrackers. He woke up in shock and saw that the warm pavilion was on fire. He called for help. Fortunately, it did not become a prairie fire. The arsonist had already fled far away without a trace. After the fire was extinguished, upon investigation, it was found that more than ten loads of firewood were piled under the left side of the warm pavilion, and the official titles, virtue plaques, and flag umbrellas that were displayed in the main hall were placed on top, and the oil paper used for scarves was lit, so the fire went straight up to the warm pavilion. There were guards and night watchmen in the county office, but the arsonist openly carried firewood on his shoulders to come here. This is also very strange!

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation Thirty Years Ago

— Wen Jin

Since the end of the war, all kinds of prices in Shanghai, whether for clothing, food, housing, or transportation, have risen to the highest levels in history. Rice is as precious as pearls, firewood is as expensive as cassia, and people are struggling to survive. Now, let us examine the various prices of thirty years ago, which are truly worlds apart. They are now recorded below for reference:

(1) Rice — 2 yuan per dan. (2) Firewood — 100 wen per dan. (3) Pork — 60 wen per catty. (4) Mutton — 80 wen per catty. (5) Yellow croaker — 20 wen per catty. (6) Oil — 56 wen per catty. (7) Soy sauce — 64 wen per catty. (8) Salt — 16 wen per catty. (9) White sugar — 60 wen per catty. (10) Green vegetables — 150 wen per dan. (11) Eggs — 4 wen each. (12) Chicken — 60 wen per catty. (13) Tofu — 80 wen per block. (14) Soybeans — 12 wen per catty. (15) Noodles — 16 wen per catty. (16) Cotton — 1.8 yuan per dan. (17) Silk satin — 150 wen per foot. (18) Cloth — More than 10 feet per corner. (19) Sedan chair — 400 wen per trip (about 10 li). (20) Wheelbarrow — 150 wen per trip (about 10 li). (21) City house — 3 yuan per month per building. (22) Haircut — 50 wen for adults, 10 wen for boys, 7 wen for girls. (23) Shen Bao — 300 wen per month.

Note — At that time, 1 yuan of copper coins could only be exchanged for 110 coins (i.e., 1,100 wen).

### The Protective Care of Suits

— He Wei

When we wear suits on weekdays, we inevitably get a lot of dust on them. Over time, they lose their original beauty. Therefore, every time we return from outside, we must brush off the dust from the clothes we take off with a clothes brush. Whether it is the jacket or the pants, the brushing method must be the same. First, brush from the bottom up to make the fibers go against the grain, and then brush from the top down to straighten the fibers and restore them to their original state. Be careful not to use too much force when brushing to avoid damaging the material, because suits are mostly made of wool fabric. Even if it is not a wool fabric, the same brushing method must be used. Otherwise, not only will you not be able to brush off the dust brought back from outside, but you will also easily damage it. In addition, whether you wear it often or leave it at home without wearing it, you must knock it with a bamboo stick or a thin wooden stick once a week to completely remove the dust that has penetrated into the fibers.

If you find stains or grease stains on your clothes, you must find a way to remove them immediately. If it is a new wine stain, you can use a water-soaked towel to wrap the stained area and rub it. It can be removed immediately. If it has been a considerable amount of time, you can use rice straw ash to boil juice and wipe it on, and then wipe it with water to eliminate it.

If the stain is caused by fruit juice, you can use ordinary laundry soap to rub it on and wash it lightly with water to remove it. Sweat stains on the collar, cuffs, and other places can be wiped with volatile oil at any time to eliminate them.

Pants cuffs are most easily attached to mud stains. Do not wipe them when they are wet. Wait until they are dry and wipe them with gauze.

Suit pants must have neat creases, so it is sometimes necessary to iron them often, but too many ironing sessions will inevitably damage the fabric, so you must use other methods to compensate for this defect.

The most common method is "night pressing," that is, folding the suit pants and placing them between pillows or under felt when you sleep every night. However, this new method is most likely to cause some parts to wrinkle or show creases, so you must pay special attention when folding.

In addition, there is also a hanging method, that is, hanging the suit upside down on a suit hanger; there is also a pressing method using a pants press, which is made of two wooden boards, priced from several yuan to more than ten yuan. For the sake of economy, the night pressing method is still the most ideal.

Suit fabrics, especially wool gabardine, are most likely to become shiny where they come into contact with desks and chairs the most. If it has already been discovered, you can use a wet towel to iron it, and it can immediately restore its original beauty. When changing clothes, when washing, you must completely remove the dirt in the pockets. After washing and drying, it must be completely dry before you can put it away. The edges of the pockets, around the buttons, the cuffs, the collar, and the trouser legs must be wiped clean with volatile oil, and then stored in a clothes box, or ironed slightly before putting them in the box. It would be even better if you add a little insecticide.

### Rooftop Garden Design

— Written by Cang Qi

### Home and Garden

— Zhuo Dai

Two weeks ago, I visited Gu's Garden with a friend, and I was deeply moved, so I wrote two articles about gardens and sent them to this magazine. Unexpectedly, yesterday I suddenly met a certain gentleman, and he strongly disagreed with my writing this kind of article.

He said, "Chinese people don't even have homes now, so how can they talk about gardens?" His words are actually specious. My answer is, "If you don't have a home, you don't necessarily need a garden, but if you have a home, you must have a garden."

The reason why the ancients called it a family is that the necessity of a garden is entirely from a sanitary point of view. In short, it tells people not to shrink at home all day long, but to spend at least half of their time outdoors. Therefore, the word "family" is completely equal and does not favor one side. The so-called outdoor room in Europe and the United States also means to expand the time spent in the house to the outdoors.

Now, there are indeed many Chinese people who don't have homes. These people who don't have homes, of course, live in the open air. The open air is the garden. Although they cannot shelter from the wind and rain, they are outdoors all day long, so they no longer need a garden. Those who have homes should not be ignored. If they are suffocated in the house like being locked in a birdcage, from a hygienic point of view, they really need a "garden."

My advocacy of a garden is specifically for a group of people who have homes. If you have a home, you must practice the word "family." As for those who have gardens but no homes, of course, I hope that they also have homes and become a family.

In short, everyone must have a family. Those who only have a home must have a garden, and those who only have a garden must have a home. It is definitely not enough to have one thing first.

### Seasickness

— Lu Lishi

"Seasickness" is a strange and common term that occupies a serious component in the "travel" aspect of human life. Many people, it can be said that everyone, suffers from this annoying disease, but some people are used to life on the ship, and they are not afraid of this "seasickness" problem.

Because of this inertia, some places inevitably sigh that they cannot travel. It is said that most of the people in the national government have this "seasickness" disease. Therefore, when the central government sent representatives to Guangdong and Guangxi to invite Mr. Hu Hanmin, Mr. Li Bai, and others, they all declined because they were afraid of the waterway from Shanghai to Hong Kong, but Sun Zhesheng and Kong Xiangxi were not afraid of the wind and waves. I also saw in the previous report that the famous Chinese Kunqu opera actress Meng Xiaodong also refused the invitation of the Golden Grand Theater because she was afraid of seasickness. In short, people's "seasickness" is very common. But the world has fundamentally more water than land. How can we escape the life of "riding the wind and waves"?

The cause of "seasickness" is very complicated. The main reason is that the vestibular nerve in the inner ear reacts to shaking. The vestibular nerve is a nerve that maintains the body's balance. When our head moves rapidly, the hair-like endings of the vestibular nerve are also shaken, and they are transmitted to the nerves, which contract various muscles to maintain the body's balance. At the same time, they directly or indirectly stimulate the vagus nerve and other nerves, affecting the digestive organs (stomach and intestines) and circulatory organs (heart and blood). As a result, dizziness, vomiting, headache, and pale complexion all follow.

Treatment methods: If you feel uncomfortable in your chest, open the window to change the air. If you have an empty stomach, it will inevitably cause vomiting. Find something else to distract yourself. Do not be afraid of dizziness. Do not let the bad surroundings stimulate your nerves. As for medicines, no specific medicine has been invented yet. Ordinary sedatives and analgesics, such as Rendan, Tiger Balm, etc., are used. Sometimes anesthetics can also be used, but they are not fundamental solutions.

Finally, one more sentence, nervous people are most likely to get this disease.

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

Although the ancients said, "Those who eat meat are vulgar," it seems that people in this world are willing to be "vulgar" people, and there is even a saying that "one day cannot be without this gentleman." Therefore, when there was no meat to eat a few days ago, people became restless. Although there is meat to eat as usual these days, the price is much more expensive than before. One dollar only buys about one catty and ten taels, which is not much different from the price of chicken and duck, which really makes my economic menu impossible to economize. When it comes to aquatic products, there are many cheap goods to eat. One corner can buy a large yellow croaker, one corner can buy five squid, two corners can buy a catty of anchovies, and four corners can buy a catty of fish. Okay, if you want to talk about economy, you have to rely on aquatic products. As for pork, as long as you don't eat whole pieces of meat for the time being, eating some sliced meat and shredded meat won't cost much after all. In addition, beef is still cheap. Buy one corner of beef and add some onions to make a bowl of stir-fried shredded beef with onions.

Monday

Curry sliced meat, steamed shad, stir-fried chicken feathers, mixed Malan head

Stir-fried shredded beef with onions, amaranth yellow croaker soup, scallion broad bean puree, pickled mustard greens with fried tofu

### Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of the Wage-Earning Class

— Cang Ping

The wage-earning class I am talking about refers specifically to people with salaries between thirty and forty yuan, because this group of people accounts for the majority in Shanghai, and I am one of them, so the pain I feel is more personal. The following is a breakdown:

In Shanghai, where people are only recognized by their clothes, it is necessary to wear clothes that are not necessarily very exquisite, but must be "rough and bright." Now that everything is expensive, making an ordinary long gown, including the material and tailoring, costs between ten yuan, and if you make one, you will "not see the light of day" for half a month; if you add winter clothes in the winter, it is even more unthinkable.

Poor people have big stomachs, this is indeed true; because poor people do not eat enough three meals a day, of course, they have no extra money to eat snacks or refreshments. At the same time, the working hours are longer than ordinary people. When it is time to eat, they are already starving, and once the white rice is in their mouths, they will naturally devour it, and they will not feel full until they have eaten three or four bowls. However, the current price of rice has suddenly increased sharply, and the wealthy hoarders are smiling and making a fortune, and the most suffering are of course the wage-earning class.

At the age of thirty-five, no one will mend torn clothes, which is of course painful, but when someone does mend them one day, the housing problem will make you feel so difficult that you can't breathe. Because the current sub-landlords have mostly paid thousands of yuan in advance to rent the house, and who is not determined to make a profit, forcing it out of the sub-tenants? Therefore, a pigeon-sized garret room now costs at least twenty or thirty yuan a month in rent, plus half a year or a year's deposit. Poor wage-earning class, you are born to be heavily exploited.

Finally, I want to talk about the act of "travel," and when you can't go on the current road, you have to wander around the corners. Because we also have parents, wives, and children, and we cannot live with our bodies exposed, our stomachs empty, and sleeping in the open air. Everything we need has been done to the point of saving as much as possible, and we are still struggling. What is most sighing is that in such an environment, the generally profit-seeking tycoons are still unwilling to show some conscience and are still doing the act of exploitation. Your pockets are of course full, and at the same time, the blood of the common people will be exhausted. The inevitable result is that the common people are at the end of their rope, filling the ditches, and the tycoons' dreams of gold are probably not going to last either.

Special Issue for the Second Anniversary of the Chinese Women's Sewing and Embroidery Training Institute
— Written by Feng Wenfeng

### The Founding Process of the Chinese Women's Sewing and Embroidery Training Institute

— Tang Aimei

In today's society, there are two different views on women: (1) Women should be free and liberated. (2) Women should be virtuous wives and good mothers. These two views are the focus of the current women's issue. Mei believes that liberation has its scope and virtue has its purpose.

(1) The scope of liberation: In the past, Chinese women's lives were completely bound within the family, subject to the domination of men, and used as men's appendages. They had no education or occupation at all. By the time of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the first women's liberation was created. After the founding of the Republic of China, the trend of freedom and liberation was even more vigorous. Women were able to serve society. Like administrative officials, administrative staff, doctors, lawyers, Hu Shi, teachers, etc., there are a few people with real knowledge and ability, but most women still do not get equal treatment with men. The work is particularly hard, and the rewards are particularly small. Therefore, if women want to truly be liberated, it is not about talking empty words, but about factual liberation. Only economic independence is possible, and if economic independence is to be possible, one must learn a skill.

(2) The purpose of virtue: It is not the old ethics of "inner words do not come out of the boudoir." Women are the private property of men and absolutely do not contribute to society. However, household chores such as cooking, knitting, embroidery, hygiene, and childcare are the women's undeniable responsibility. It is not impossible to participate in social activities and contribute to society on the one hand, while taking care of both sides. However, some women spend their days in leisure and entertainment, and all family affairs are entrusted to servants. Even the important task of educating children is entrusted to servants with no education. They are willing to degenerate and abandon their responsibilities, and are despised by men and cursed by society.

Therefore, if we women want to be liberated and virtuous, we must learn skills that meet the needs of the environment. What skills are inherent to women, require a short amount of time, are economically cheap, do not require high-level knowledge, and are essential for society and families? That is economic embroidery.

Because in the port of Shanghai alone, there are so many embroidery shops, clothing companies, children's clothing companies, and ready-made clothing shops. Are the workers who make them women? Are the store employees women? Are their decorations and living expenses supplied by us women? Our inherent production work is instead manipulated by men. Other clothes, pants, shoes, and hats in the family are not sewn by ourselves, and they can only be consumed on a daily basis, and production is considered shameful. How can we talk about economic independence!

After several years of observation, Mei believes that the work of sewing and embroidery is extremely necessary to promote. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, with the support of Mr. Yang Weiyu, Yang Chonggao, Pan Yangyao, Jiang Wenyu, Wang Liming, Wang Xiaoying, Sun Xiangzhong, and Zhang Duansheng as directors, the Chinese Women's Sewing and Embroidery Training Institute was founded on March 26 at 168 Guling Road. In April of that year, it was registered with the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. Although it has only been two years since its founding, fortunately with the support of people in society, the students are developing well. In addition to teaching sewing and embroidery, they also read for two hours a day to instill knowledge and cultivate their spirit. However, less than five months after the founding, the war broke out, and the students scattered. It was once suspended, but soon the students who stayed in Shanghai were gathered again to sew clothes and bedding for wounded soldiers and refugees, doing their best to fulfill their responsibilities. Since the war moved westward, the price of houses in Shanghai has become very high, and due to limited economic capacity, it has not been possible to expand as much as possible, which I deeply regret.

All the students in this institute have witnessed the orphaned children in Shanghai who are in urgent need of education and care. All the relief organizations have limited funds. Taking advantage of this second anniversary, with the spirit of helping ourselves and helping others, we will exhibit and sell our productions to help orphaned children. We welcome people from all walks of life to visit, guide, and purchase enthusiastically. This institute is very fortunate, and the orphaned children are very fortunate.

### Reflections on the Charity Sale Exhibition of the China Women's Sewing Machine Embroidery Training Institute

— Huang Dinghui

The China Women's Sewing Machine Embroidery Training Institute is Shanghai's only vocational skills training institution for women. Presided over by Ms. Tang Aimei, it has been managed arduously and has weathered two wars. It is fully equipped in terms of modern crafts, such as woolen yarn work, appliqué work, tailoring, machine installation, machine sewing, and machine embroidery. All departments are complete, and the achievements are excellent, which are deeply praised by people from all walks of life. At the same time, it is also a concrete manifestation of our women's efforts in practical work.

China's social system still suffers deeply from the vestiges of feudal shackles. Generally, women compatriots rarely have the opportunity to receive equal education. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to seek employment. The China Women's Craft Sewing Machine Embroidery Training Institute is a savior for sisters who are out of school and unemployed. After a short period of time, they can learn a skill, produce works, seek economic independence, and achieve a self-reliant life.

When seeing some sisters in society with better economic conditions, they are often accustomed to indulging in comfort, calling upon servants, and entrusting everything to maids. The needs of children's clothing are mostly purchased from the market, and they regard crafts and sewing as unworthy of learning. They would rather waste precious time on illegitimate entertainment. Once the family economy suffers an unexpected crisis, they are at a loss and have no skills to support each other, thus causing all kinds of unfortunate events. There are really many such situations, directly harming the family, and indirectly harming the country and society.

Especially at present, when our country and nation are struggling for survival, the entire nation should promote diligence in order to support the long-term war of resistance and advocate for a thrift movement. Only through diligence can we truly save. Sisters in schools should use their spare time to learn practical crafts. Sisters in families should use their leisure time in housekeeping to learn practical crafts. Sisters with jobs should use their spare time to learn practical crafts. If their own economic strength is abundant, they can talk about producing works and selling them for charity to relieve refugees. Like the charity sale for disaster relief organized by the China Women's Craft Sewing Training Institute this time, it is the most meaningful contribution. There are more than two million sisters in Shanghai. We hope that, except for the young, weak, and elderly, every sister has the ability to produce and does not become a simple parasite.

In the Spring and Autumn Period, Old Lady Jing Jiang of Lu weaved even in her old age. As the wife of a high-ranking official, she dared not steal comfort. Because of her diligence, she was able to teach her son the right way and encourage him to be honest in his official duties. Now, Old Lady Zhao, with her white hair, rushes to the battlefield. Because of her bravery, all her children are doing their best to serve the nation. These two diligent and hardworking old ladies are truly ancient and modern models. In this extraordinary period, if we young people still only seek temporary peace, can we not be ashamed when we search our conscience? How should we be vigilant?

The economic expenditures, budgets, and final accounts of each family all depend on the wise housewives to manage. If the housewife can be thrifty and diligent, not only can the economy be rationalized, but also because of her virtues, she can influence men to be loyal to their duties, not greedy, and not betray their principles. Everyone's spirit is supremely comforted. This is a very important key and the responsibility that every family sister should fulfill in her position.

The proceeds from the charity sale exhibition of the China Women's Craft Sewing Machine Embroidery Training Institute will all be used for disaster relief. I dare to express some shallow feelings with my foolishness and ignorance. I hope that all sisters will actively visit, donate generously, and benefit the disaster-stricken compatriots, and give criticisms. All social undertakings need to be promoted with collective wisdom and efforts.

### Women's Public Occupation

— Yan Ni

Since the liberation of women, women's occupations have become a major issue in the women's world. Although there are many opinions on the issue of women's occupations in various countries around the world, there are still no suitable occupations to accommodate women. Some even say that women should return to the kitchen, and some say that women cannot participate in politics. Isn't this simply binding women and reversing the course of history?

Since women's occupations have such an inadequate low status in society, many women are complaining that there is no way out. Commentators say that the women's world is not progressive enough, has insufficient awareness, and has not removed dependence, which has made them accessories to men. This is really too insulting to women.

Although a small number of women are indeed like that, with a particularly heavy dependence, it should not be said to the entire women's world. There are really many problems as to why women's occupations cannot be resolved! Women in the intellectual world often have too high hopes because they do not understand the truth of occupation and life, and they despise all occupations and are unwilling to do them, which leads to them wandering without a way out. This is also a weakness.

The inability to popularize education to the masses of women and the lack of technical training for the masses of women have prevented female compatriots from forming a united front. This has greatly affected the way out for female compatriots. Now, during the period of the War of Resistance, everyone must shoulder his mission to prepare for the creation of a new China. Of course, it cannot be said that women are an exception.

Therefore, we women must create a new environment based on the spirit of hard work, hard work, and practical work. Our work only requires meeting the urgent needs of the current stage, constantly engaging in academic cultivation and skills learning, and eliminating all vanity. As long as we are persevering and willing to work hard, our occupational problems will no longer require anyone to solve or review them.

Now, Mr. Tang Aimei is establishing the China Women's Sewing Machine Embroidery Training Institute because of the absolute need for this social environment, seeking new ways out for women's occupations, aiming to create specialized technical talents to serve society and open up a new way out for social occupations. This is worth celebrating for our women's world.

I believe that the China Women's Sewing Machine Embroidery Training Institute is a ray of dawn for women's occupations and a foundation for women's public occupations.

### Women's Liberation and Women's Work

— Zhang Peijin

Since the beginning of history, Chinese women have suffered from spiritual, moral, and physical restraints, and they have not been able to hope for outward development. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, based on the egalitarian spirit of the God Worshipping Society, made arrangements for the liberation of women. The Jintian Uprising, the Opium War, and the May Fourth Movement gave rise to vigorous phenomena in the liberation of women. However, no matter what, in the process of fighting for women's liberation, women themselves should act as the main force. This is a great era. People living in the great era should shoulder the responsibilities of the great era. Chinese women have also been designated to shoulder their tasks. How can we bear this kind of task? The principle is the efforts of women themselves to strive for women's ability to be self-reliant.

Sewing and embroidery are also events that should be learned in the process of women's self-reliance. Mr. Tang Aimei, the director of the China Sewing and Embroidery Training Institute, in order to seek liberation for women and seek independence for women, founded the Sewing and Embroidery Training Institute through hardships to develop women's skills and increase women's production power.

The training institute has been established for two years. During these two years, the institute has been managed to the best of its ability. Not only is the equipment complete, but also the teachers are patiently teaching, and the students are coming enthusiastically. Therefore, progress is rapid and the scope is expanding. The purpose of the institute is not only to teach each student's special skills, but also to introduce graduates with excellent grades to various places to serve and shoulder considerable responsibilities for society.

I silently wish that the Sewing and Embroidery Training Institute can make great contributions to society and the country, and provide relief to refugee children. I also hope that the women's world will be influenced by it and give play to their own abilities to complete our women's liberation.

### Connections

— Qiu Zhi

Having "face," and being skilled in "eloquence" and "tactics," seems to have exhausted one's abilities in this world, allowing one to do as one pleases and be invincible. However, I always feel that a "trilogy" is not as good as a "tetralogy," and it is always necessary to add one more part to achieve perfection and great fortune. Therefore, I boldly risk the repetition of "shortcuts" and "inner lines" in "must go" and "coopting" in "degrees," adding this most basic "connections."

The so-called most basic refers to the feeling of "standing on solid ground and taking every step carefully"; it also refers to the fact that pavilions cannot be built in the air after all, but must be based on the ground. Therefore, connections are the necessary prerequisites for anyone who wants to achieve something, establish something, exert something, or even eat a mouthful of bitter rice. With connections, if you have a skill, whether it is mouth or hand, it can be especially promoted, blossoming and bearing fruit on this "strength." Even if you are incapable of anything, your rice bowl will not be smashed. Otherwise, it is difficult to say. No matter how great your ability, who will see it! Confucius had no connections, so he had to work as a "farm employee" (Cheng Tian) and a "warehouse manager" (Wei Li). When he had no choice, he was even willing to be a "night watchman" (Bao Guan Ji Tuo).

"Don't be an official if you have no one in the court" has become an unchangeable theorem for thousands of years. Assuming that you have no "people" in the "court" and you are actually an "official," then you are guaranteed to have hundreds of troubles and be blamed at every turn, and you will definitely end up rolling up your bedding. If there are "people," then "officials protect each other," and they will definitely be able to cover up, turn big things into small things, and small things into nothing, smoothly until the Western Paradise. "Mentioning this horse's background is huge," everyone will be surprised. With connections like this, what need is there for eloquence, what need is there for tactics, and face is also preserved.

It is said that in the past, lawsuits were nothing more than a race in connections. Whoever had connections to run and ran fast won the lawsuit, otherwise whoever lost the lawsuit. The right and wrong of the accident were not predetermined and not asked about. Even thieves must first look at the connections, otherwise they will not be able to enter, and they can only sigh at the wall. Or even if they have entered the door and entered the hall, they will return empty-handed after entering the treasure mountain, venting their anger by making a mess; even more unfortunately, they will fall into the Eight Trigrams Formation and be unable to get out, so they will be captured. Alas, how lovely are connections! Alas, how fearful are connections!

However, the importance of connections is indeed known to everyone, and where to find connections has become a difficult problem; as for clearly knowing that they are connections, how to use them is even more difficult. We still need to discuss and study carefully.

The ancients said, "There is fragrant grass everywhere in the world"; I say, "There are connections everywhere in the world." Therefore, the difficulty of the problem does not lie in whether there are connections, but in whether they can be found. Zhang Junrui will understand "transferring his heart" as soon as he sees "footprints," and he is good at finding connections. I think with this spirit of being attentive and paying attention to everything, the solution to this problem will be more than half thought out.

With connections, how to use them? I say, there are many ways to use them, and the key is diligence; diligence will never fail, and it has been like this for a long time. If you are going to pay your respects, you may as well pay your respects many times; if you are sending gifts, you may as well send gifts many times; if you are inquiring, asking for advice, flattering, or flattery, or even eating, drinking, playing cards, and playing with prostitutes with them,..., you may as well go many times.... Once you are unfamiliar and twice you are familiar, until you are scolded as a bastard and waved out of the door, there is hope of getting a good job. This is what Li Hongzhang's confidant told us. Because "Jiang Yuan conceived by stepping on the footprints of a giant," occasional walking still has such an effect, let alone diligence! Therefore, diligently applying the way of "must go," the world will be greatly determined!

If you are not happy to follow other people's connections and want others to follow your connections, of course I also agree. As long as you are rich, "distant relatives will come to you if you are rich in the deep mountains." As long as you have beauty, "peaches and plums do not speak, but a path is formed below." As long as you have great talent, King Wen of Zhou will naturally walk to the Wei River, and Liu Xuande will naturally visit the thatched cottage three times. As long as you are noble and pure, people will naturally walk to your "fishing platform" higher than the "Yuntai"...

However, I am a little worried for you: today, the style of kidnapping is prevalent, and being rich in the deep mountains is not safe after all. Today, if you enter the "palace," I am afraid that "those who are not allowed to see you" are more than "thirty-six years," let alone you "living in seclusion in the deep valley." Today, "the yellow bell is destroyed and abandoned, and the clay pot thunders," if you don't come out, who cares? Please fish for a lifetime and lie down for thousands of years. Today, everyone already only likes to go to "Yaotai," "shelter from the wind," and even "debt tower," and they are not even happy to go to "Yuntai." Who is willing to go to "fishing platform"!...

Forget it, since you are a human being, you must do your best. If you are not willing to starve to death, you should still follow other people's connections and ask for help!

### Shake Hands, Old Sir.

### The Bombing of Tuanfeng - A Wartime Account

— Sheng Dan

The gentle river breeze at dawn caressed every soldier, "How pleasant!" everyone exclaimed. Soon, the sun spread out its smiling face, sincerely kissing the mountain peaks on both sides, seeming to say, "Friends, work harder, the light will always shine on you!" On that day, a group of nine of us left the embrace of Wuhan, went down the river along the current, and arrived at Tuanfeng on the north bank of the Yangtze River.

Tuanfeng is the leading town of Huanggang County in Hubei Province. To the southeast, the towering Erzhou and Lion Continent squat like lions. The surging river roars constantly under their feet. It is said that this is where Liu Yu of the Jin Dynasty defeated Huan Xuan. In military terms, Huanggang covers Wuhan above and controls Jiujiang below. The situation is very important, so Tuanfeng is their target of destruction, and they often bomb it desperately. Because we had to take the road to Luotian to enter the mountains, we had to pass through Tuanfeng, and we also had some temporary work, so we came here.

The boat moored, and the air raid siren suddenly rang. The people crowded on the river bank immediately dispersed in all directions. The noisy morning market also disappeared under the urgent siren. "Damn it! Come on, the people of Tuanfeng are not afraid of death!" Curses echoed in the streets and alleys. Even the children's eyes burst into flames with hatred. Indeed, the flames of the nation spread with the bombing, all the way to every corner. Who says there is no certainty of victory?

A buzzing sound came from the air, and the whole town was as silent as a lonely tomb; but the sound of footsteps on the street could still be faintly heard. This was the military police patrolling to prevent the discovery of "signals." As I turned a corner on the street, suddenly a hand was placed on my shoulder. "Ah, you're here. Will the military-civilian friendship meeting in the evening be held on time?" Fang, the division commander stationed in Tuanfeng, appeared at the end of the street. His calm and composed attitude was obviously the result of a long war. "Even if Tuanfeng is bombed to the ground, we will still hold it!..." Before he finished speaking, seven bombers were already circling overhead.

"There are five more!... Ah, they're dividing into groups!..." Someone was talking.

Boom!—Boom boom!—

The sound of exploding bombs continued like a mountain collapse. Black smoke filled the surroundings. A tree that flew up from somewhere fell from the smoke and landed on the surging beach; tiles, bricks, and gravel flew in all directions like hail. Every moment a bomb landed, a gust of wind rushed into the entrance of the air raid shelter. This continued for about three quarters of an hour before it stopped. The rescue team and the fire brigade immediately set out and carried out their respective tasks. But strangely enough, as a result of the bombing, Tuanfeng was still intact except for a yellow cow that died tragically.

### Forging

— Ding Di

We are in forging.

Forging is enough to increase people's mental and physical strength. We know that fish forget their eyes in the water, and their eyes become blind. Deer also develop special heads and necks because they look up and climb trees for food. Seamen who have experienced suffering and worry are startled by the sight of huge waves and raging waves. Many dangerous capsizing have been dealt with safely. The difficulties of the past are often good lessons for a life at sea.

A person needs forging to strive for growth and soundness. Forging is often wind and waves, difficulties, worries, blows, practice, and labor. You don't have to be afraid, and you don't have to shrink back. This is a good opportunity for you. You can use it to temper yourself; from some difficulties, from hardship, you become another person. There is no difficult word in your dictionary, you regard bitterness as sweetness, you turn impossibility into proficiency, you smile to take the enemy's head, and try the blood on your Wu hook.

Look, that is a blacksmith's workshop. The stars blink in the darkness, and the hammer strikes the branded iron again and again. On the anvil of a factory, in the raging fire, the red snake tongues, the green flames, the flowers of light burst out, singing passionately. Although that is a painful encouragement, a ruthless blow, making it painful, making it sour, making it angry, and making it wail, it does not shed tears, does not groan, does not retreat, and does not cry. It stands up, endures tears and sorrow, and on the giant anvil, in the water tank, under the iron hammer, it is forged and tempered.

Cold turns warm, black turns red, brittle turns flexible. After being tortured by external forces, the forged iron has tasted a lot of hardship, and it becomes more energetic, more brave, and stronger.

We love to watch the sparks and stars sparkle in the dark night. We love to hear the rapid sound of the hammer, which makes a huge sound. Light and light shoot at each other, force and force rub against each other, light is passionate, and force is huge.

We must have light, we must have heat——we must forge. This is a test of survival, this is a threat of death, this is a bitter battle of hard work, this is a harbinger of triumph, this is a desperate revenge, this is the sweeping away of the last grain of sand, this is a painful elegy, this is a tempering of steel and iron bones.

An attack of a storm, madness damaged the civilization, and violence, like an iron hand, gripped the heart of peace. The misfortune of the century makes us painful, sour, angry, and wailing, but we do not shed tears, do not groan, do not retreat, and do not cry. We must use this hardship to temper ourselves. A country will prosper through many difficulties, and we solemnly and strongly accept this gift - we come to forge.

We come to forge, for growth and soundness.

### National Revival and the Removal of Idols (Part Two)

— Yu

Yesterday, I said that whatever people love, if their love becomes so great that they no longer need God, no longer think about the relationship between people and God, then that thing becomes an idol for that person. But I haven't given any examples yet. In my view, prostitution, gambling, eating, dressing, reputation, money, wealth, honor, all material enjoyment, the poison of carnal desires! As long as one's love for these things surpasses love for God, and they are constantly on one's mind, all of these become idols in the heart. What will happen if these idols fill people's hearts? Needless to say, this is the reason for unrest in people's hearts, the root of all misfortunes, the true cause of personality degradation, and the beginning of spiritual disintegration. Aren't we promoting spiritual mobilization? Aren't we arousing the people to endure hardship and bide their time? Aren't we saying that the final victory and future revival depend on whether our citizens can rectify their spirit and cultivate their morality? Rejecting the truth and worshiping idols is the overall cause of spiritual depletion and moral degradation. Please turn to the seventh chapter of the Book of Joshua in the Bible and read the account of the Israelites being defeated by their enemies at Ai. God instructed Joshua: "You must consecrate the people and prepare for tomorrow, for the Lord, the God of Israel, says this: Israel, there are devoted things among you. You cannot stand against your enemies until you remove them." What are these "devoted things"? They are idols. Without removing them, the country's revival will not be easily achieved. Therefore, we must strive to remove all idols, both formal and in our hearts. Shanghai Christian Literature Society, P.O. Box 37

### Short-Lived Gaudy Flower

— Junbo

Should we say that a gaudy flower has added much beauty to the world? Friend, you say you have a clever mind. Should this verdant branch be a symbol of the gaudy flower's short life? Look at its arrogant appearance, stealing the brilliance of the sun and moon, borrowing a gentle breeze, flaunting its haughty coquettishness. It's truly shameful. Its smiling attentiveness stealthily replaces the spirits of many small flowers. Friend, don't be moved, close the door to your heart, and pay no attention to its charming manipulation.

Yes, you speak well, throwing it away wouldn't even be considered a sin. Cut its roots; break its branches; let's see how much power it has left. Use rude toes to crush the earthworm's home.

Agile swallows are unwilling to let their slender legs be caught by its branches. This is originally its own sin. Who would be willing to lean their youth against it and confide their innermost feelings? Unless those few ugly toads, insisting on placing their elongated necks on its legs, croaking out a hoarse tune, hoping to win one or two of its favors. Friend, don't keep sighing, look at our arms, they are strong enough.

Who says it is truly an indestructible diamond? It is short-lived and will soon wither one day. Let us shout, shaking its heart: "Short-lived gaudy flower, bah, be careful of your years!"

### From "Cultural Figures" to "Charity Sales"

— Yalu

Since the start of the War of Resistance, many ambitious cultural figures have bravely gone to the front lines. Their strength is sufficient to cooperate with politics and military affairs. In some places, the people do not quite understand the significance of the War of Resistance. Through the cultural figures mentioned above writing lively and popular texts for widespread propaganda and explanation, the people in every corner have been able to deeply recognize the importance of the War of Resistance for national survival.

Compared to the cultural figures on the front lines, those residing in the isolated island cannot help but feel some shame—due to the environment, they cannot work actively, which is indeed a fact. However, reviewing the past year or so, their firm beliefs and common goals have remained consistent. They are striving for their original position, and undoubtedly have achieved considerable results.

Generally, true cultural figures only know how to fight for truth, and do not engage in activities driven by profit or selling their souls. Their lives have always been bitter. Now they are still able to sell their hard-earned works for charity. This spirit of serving the greater good is truly commendable. When the country is fighting for survival in the War of Resistance, contributing strength if one has it, and money if one has it, is originally the natural duty of every citizen. Therefore, the "charity sale" movement is not only the work of cultural figures, but must be organized and systematically expanded to every industrial and commercial body, making it a spontaneous movement of the broad masses. The greatness of China's material and human resources is unparalleled. Currently, because mobilization is not widespread or well-organized, all the strength is still latent. If the people unanimously and automatically offer their greatest contribution, the quantity will surely present an astonishing figure. (Charity Sale Donations)
