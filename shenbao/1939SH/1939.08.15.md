### President Chiang's Message to the People of Shanghai; Cultural Circles Build Spiritual Bastion; Financial Circles Strengthen Confidence in Legal Tender; Government Has Prepared Comprehensive Measures to Put Wartime Economy on the Right Track

(Chongqing) Today marks the second anniversary of the start of the Battle of Shanghai. President Chiang Kai-shek issued a message to the people of Shanghai, beginning with the words, "None of our soldiers and civilians at the front and in the rear today are not thinking of Shanghai, none are not missing our compatriots who remain in Shanghai. I would especially like to express my thoughts and expectations to our compatriots who remain in Shanghai." President Chiang then made the following appeals to the people of Shanghai: (1) The cultural and public opinion circles should establish a strong spiritual "bastion" to resist Japanese propaganda. (2) The economic and financial circles should unite to strengthen confidence, trust legal tender, and stabilize finance. (3) The youth of Shanghai must understand their responsibilities, be diligent and self-improving, and engage in the study of various academic and technical skills related to resistance and reconstruction. (4) The workers of Shanghai should unite as one, love and respect themselves, support resistance and reconstruction, and carry it through to the end. (5) People from all walks of life in Shanghai should help each other, share weal and woe. If the people of Shanghai can endure the current difficult period, they will surely enhance the glory of the nation and the national character. The message detailed Shanghai's past achievements in China's reform and revolution, especially the tragic and heroic sacrifices made in the Battle of Shanghai. President Chiang said in this regard, "The loyal and courageous acts of the people of Shanghai in resisting the war have written countless tragic histories worthy of song and tears, causing the Japanese to realize that their delusion of forcing China to submit within a few weeks was a fantasy, and suddenly changed international perceptions, knowing that the Chinese nation is absolutely not a nation that can be subjugated, and knowing that China's resistance war will definitely have a bright future... Although this was two years ago, it is still clearly remembered in the minds of our compatriots throughout the country today." President Chiang continued that since the fall of Shanghai, many factories and cultural groups in Shanghai, as well as many skilled technical experts and technicians, have moved to the interior, making important contributions to the resistance movement. Now that the War of Resistance has entered its third year, the situation of the people of Shanghai has become more complex and more difficult, but the situation of the War of Resistance is improving daily and approaching final victory. Therefore, the Japanese are intensifying their political and economic oppression of the Chinese in Shanghai, and the responsibility of the Chinese in Shanghai for the country's war has also increased. President Chiang earnestly said, "Now there are only two paths before us: one is to surrender and perish, sinking into eternal slavery, and the other is to struggle hard, persevere, seek victory, and revive China. This is the only path that patriotic and courageous people should take." President Chiang also discussed the currency situation in Shanghai, saying that fluctuations in the foreign exchange market cannot affect the price of the legal tender itself. China's basic needs of food, clothing, housing, and transportation can be largely self-sufficient. China has endless treasures and resources, so the legal tender has endless reserves and credit. Once the people recognize that the War of Resistance has the certainty of final victory and the country has a bright future, then their belief in the legal tender will naturally not be fundamentally shaken. President Chiang finally comforted the people of Shanghai, saying that the government has now prepared comprehensive measures to put the wartime economy on the right track. The people must understand that supporting the legal tender is a manifestation of loving the country. He hoped that people in Shanghai's economic circles would hold fast to their economic "bastion" and strengthen their trust in and love for the legal tender, which would be the greatest responsibility they could fulfill to the country and the War of Resistance.

### Anti-British Movement in Tianjin Worsens; Concessions Take Extraordinary Precautions

Armored vehicles patrol; volunteer corps fully mobilized; two demonstrations quickly dispersed; Japanese military spokesman declares blockade policy unchanged; British side responsible if situation in concessions deteriorates

(Beiping) A Japanese military spokesman issued a statement today, stating in part, "The blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin is essential for the self-defense of the Japanese army in North China, and it is also essential for maintaining peace and order in North China. Therefore, unless the British Concession in Tianjin fundamentally changes its attitude, the blockade is absolutely necessary. Furthermore, if the situation in the British Concession in Tianjin deteriorates, the British side must bear full responsibility." (Fourteenth Associated Press dispatch)

(Tianjin) To prevent any actions by the anti-British rally being held here, the British Concession Volunteer Corps was fully mobilized this morning and patrolled around the British Concession. Two anti-British rallies were held today. They were prepared to gather at 10:00 a.m. to hold a joint anti-British march. Several resolutions were passed at the anti-British rally yesterday, with the aim of "driving British forces out of the Far East" and to have all people in Japanese-occupied areas participate in the anti-British movement, and to organize anti-British societies to attack British and pro-British Chinese. The anti-British rally also sent a telegram to the Japanese government, supporting the Japanese military official's return to the matter of the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo, and sent reports to the "Provisional Government" in Beiping and the "puppet" Manchukuo government, saying that in these two days, the anti-British movement had attracted national attention, like "a wildfire," and saying, "Our purpose is to drive British forces out of the Far East. The past actions of the British have caused China to fall into colonial status. Our present work will lay a foundation for a new order in the Far East." (Fourteenth Associated Press dispatch)

(Tianjin) After the anti-British "mass rally" here, it split into two demonstrations. One was held in the former German Concession, but it quickly dispersed because its constituents had no real enthusiasm for anti-British sentiment. The other demonstration was held in the Chinese area, with several hundred participants, but thousands of onlookers. These demonstrators were led by a number of trucks, holding anti-British flags, and stopped in the Japanese Concession without proceeding further, then disbanded. The British side here is anticipating further crazy demonstrations tomorrow or later, so will continue to take precautionary measures. (Fourteenth Associated Press dispatch)

Yantai The anti-British movement here is now expanding daily. Last Friday, a small group of Japanese broke into the British Consulate, throwing bricks and stones, breaking eighteen of the consulate's windows.

Editorial

### Germany and Italy's Political Talks and the European Situation

While Britain is hesitant and Japan is indecisive, with Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo stalled, Germany and Italy are again discussing new actions in Europe. The location is Salzburg, not far from Munich. The participants are Foreign Minister Ribbentrop on the German side and Foreign Minister Ciano on the Italian side, with German leader Hitler also personally involved twice. The talks began on the 11th of this month and lasted for three days, "discussing current political issues in an extremely friendly spirit." Since the establishment of the German-Italian military alliance, this is the most important talk between the two countries. This talk demonstrates that the aggressive bloc is indeed struggling non-stop, demonstrating against the anti-aggression front whose development is not yet sound. It also hints at the impending arrival of a new European crisis. On the other hand, according to a report in the London "Financial Times," "Mussolini will propose convening an international conference in the near future to improve relations between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy." According to the French Figaro newspaper, "Warsaw is rumored to have heard that Ciano proposed to Ribbentrop a compromise solution to the Danzig dispute." Although these two statements have not been confirmed, this atmosphere alone may be enough to move Chamberlain, who is obsessed with promoting a policy of appeasement and concluding a four-power pact. Coercion and inducement go hand in hand, this is an effective old remedy, a magical treatment that can work without surgery, but the symptoms are different from the past, this time it may be ineffective!

The results of this talk, apart from issuing a hollow communique, are not announced as usual. According to foreign reports, the main issues discussed by the two sides were three: (1) the Danzig issue; (2) countries that have expressed sympathy for the German-Italian axis, especially Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria, should be centered on the German-Italian axis and organized politically to resist the "encirclement policy" issue; (3) the issue of Japan joining the German-Italian military alliance. Although these three items are not confirmed by the communique, they are the implied meaning of the topic. Moreover, Germany, because of the deep internal contradictions, can only take continuous external risks. Since seizing Memel, to conclude the so-called spring movement. Summer sings civil dramas as much as possible, sweats a little, but has no harvest; and now, it should be the season for autumn wind and nomadic horses again. Let's see how it whips and gallops!

Danzig? This is the plump fruit that Hitler is determined to get; according to them, getting it or not is a matter of German honor, but the problem is that Poland is determined to resist aggression, and Poland has also concluded a mutual assistance pact with Britain. If force is used, it is not enough to receive it with only honor guards, and blood will inevitably be shed before knowing success or failure. For months, Germany has painstakingly tried various ways and methods to seize it. In this Salzburg talk, Berlin's aim is clearly to obtain Rome's support, and Italy has followed suit more than once. In recent days, Roman newspapers have greatly advocated the reasons for Danzig's return to Germany, but they have also spread the rumor that "Mussolini is trying to ease the policy pursued by the German leader and advise him not to realize his territorial demands by means of causing war." This is exactly the same as the situation in September last year, when Roman newspapers advocated the return of the Sudetenland to Germany, and Mussolini "advised" Hitler to be cautious and careful.

According to news from France: "The actions taken by Germany towards the Free City of Danzig are only a smoke screen, in fact, a major incident is brewing in Southeastern Europe." This is not without basis. In this Salzburg talk, Germany and Italy colluded to tighten their control over Hungary and Yugoslavia, which is clearly a central issue. Originally, South Hungary and South Korea were being drawn into the axis day by day due to geographical and historical relations; but on the other hand, any independent country is certainly unwilling to be a vassal, and still wants to get closer to Britain and France and try to get rid of the control of the axis as much as possible. The Hungarian Regent Horthy's crackdown on the Nazi Party in the country, and the South Korean Prince Paul's visit to London, are clear evidence of this. All this is what Hitler must "offset". To be honest, if Hitler wants to control Europe, the strategic position of Yugoslavia and Hungary is more important than Danzig, because they are the bridge to the Balkans. Italian Fascists have made it clear: "The European situation has lost its equilibrium, and the issue of the Danube and the Balkan Peninsula urgently needs to be clarified!" Therefore, since this Italian-German talk, the crisis in the Balkans is also becoming increasingly urgent.

As for the issue of Japan joining the German-Italian military alliance, Japan has recently taken the initiative, while Germany and Italy have expressed indifference. This newspaper has repeatedly discussed this, and the meaning is still not exhausted, so allow me to comment on it separately. Today, I will only talk about the European situation, which can be summarized in one sentence: Under the united conspiracy of fascist aggressors, a new crisis is brewing in Europe. In Salzburg, we have already seen the dark shadows of the crisis.

### Anglo-Japanese Tokyo Negotiations Fall into an Ambiguous State. Japanese Military Representative Muto Flies Back to Tianjin, Uttering Threats and Enticements Before Departure.

(London) It is rumored that the Japanese government has notified Britain that if the issues of legal tender in North China and silver reserves in Tianjin are not resolved, Japan will refuse to continue negotiations with Britain. This statement was denied by government officials, who stated that the government has telegraphed new instructions to Sir Robert Craigie, the British ambassador to Japan, agreeing to hand over the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin and providing instructions on police administrative matters in the British concession. When the representatives of Britain and Japan meet next time, they can continue to discuss police power issues according to the content of the instructions. As for the statements issued by the Japanese spokesperson, if they are not included in official communiqués, they cannot be considered to have legally binding force. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry spokesman announced this morning while receiving reporters that whether Anglo-Japanese negotiations will resume depends entirely on the attitude of the United Kingdom. Before the resumption of the meeting, the Japanese side will study what attitude the United Kingdom holds towards the various pending issues. The Tianjin economic issue is of great importance to maintaining peace and order. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

(Tokyo) Ambassador Craigie visited Minister Kato this afternoon, stating that the reply from his government would arrive within a day or two, and that the reply contained a comprehensive view of the British government on security and economic issues. He expressed that he would exert his full sincerity in this Anglo-Japanese meeting to seek a comprehensive compromise, and hoped that the Japanese side would understand this point and cooperate with the British side so that the meeting could continue. Minister Kato replied that he understood the points mentioned and would consult with relevant parties before proceeding with the meeting according to the ambassador's notification. The two representatives then held various discussions on how to proceed with future meetings. As a result, it was decided that, given the nature of the economic issue, a roundtable meeting format would be avoided, and only Kato and Craigie would conduct discussions. When a decision was reached, a roundtable meeting would be convened, and local Japanese military representatives would be invited to participate in Tokyo again. Thus, the Anglo-Japanese conference, which had been suspended since the sixth roundtable meeting on July 31, could resume in two or three days, presenting a glimmer of hope. (Same dispatch, 14th)

( ) The Japanese military delegation, led by Yamatsu, which came here to participate in the Anglo-Japanese conference, departed for Tianjin this morning. The conference has, in effect, collapsed. It is reported that upon arrival in Tianjin, the Japanese delegation will submit a detailed report to General Sugiyama, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army in North China. According to the Asahi Shimbun, they will participate in important discussions to decide on the North China Japanese Army's plan to blockade the British concession. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

(Tokyo) Major General Muto, the Japanese military representative stationed in Tianjin, returned to Tianjin by plane this morning. In his departure statement, he said that since the Japanese representative stationed in Tianjin arrived in Tokyo on July 7 to attend the Anglo-Japanese talks and worked hard to resolve the Tianjin issue, but because the British side lacked sincerity, "we cannot remain in Tokyo indefinitely and have decided to return to our post. The Tianjin concession has become a source of chaos in North China's security in political, military, and economic terms. Despite repeated warnings from the Japanese side, the British concession authorities have shown no sign of repentance. The North China Japanese Army authorities, in view of the increasing harm and the urgency of the situation, have blockaded the British concession with its troops in order to eliminate the scourge. This is the first part of the Japanese military's actions, and its purpose is absolute. Therefore, if Britain has the will to lift the blockade of the concession, it should make the concession a harmless area in terms of security, which is a prerequisite. This demand made by the Japanese army to the British concession is fair and reasonable, and not harsh. The purpose of the Japanese army is simple, and its position is straightforward, but the British side is practicing a double-dealing diplomacy, attempting to drag in a third country to delay the meeting. We are well aware that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and other representatives have knowledge of the Far East and have always been resolving the problem with enthusiasm, but the British government still overestimates the erroneous reports of Kerr and other agencies stationed in China and bases its distorted knowledge of the Far East on them, which is truly regrettable. We have the 'classroom' of the British side hoping to attend the Tokyo conference, instructing on a method to fully resolve the Tianjin case, and the proper direction for Britain to implement its Far East policy, but the British side does not understand our good intentions and instead wants to use this 'classroom' to implement its traditional Far East policy. British Prime Minister Chamberlain spoke of the damage to his interests in China, calling it an 'intolerable insult.' We have been fighting China because of British aid to Chiang Kai-shek, and do not know how many lives have been sacrificed. What words can be used to console their spirits? We hope that when Britain defends its interests, it will first recognize the current situation in the Far East, and before protesting against the anti-British movement, it should reflect on its own past and present behavior. If Britain can humbly embrace our advice, Anglo-Japanese relations can be adjusted immediately, let alone this Anglo-Japanese conference. Otherwise, if Britain continues to pursue its past dreams and ignores the current reality, the consequences should be resolved by Britain itself. The day we land at this airport again by plane will be the day Britain changes its attitude." (Domei dispatch, 14th)

### Talk of Cooperation Between the United States and the Soviet Union in the Far East. Semi-Official Soviet Circles Say It Didn't Happen. Australian Foreign Policy Independent in the Pacific.

(Moscow) The new US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, presented his credentials to Mikhail Kalinin, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, on the 11th. (TASS dispatch, 11-12th)

(Moscow) According to the Polish newspaper, the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, conveyed a letter from President Roosevelt to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, stating that the United States is willing to cooperate with the Soviet Union in the Far East. If the Soviet Union goes to war with Japan in the future, the United States will guarantee protection, but on the condition that the Soviet Union signs a military agreement with Britain and France. Once the agreement is concluded, the United States plans to send a special delegation to Moscow to discuss matters. In addition, the United States has also pledged to provide economic assistance to China to resist Japan. All of the above was denied by TASS, which denounced it as nonsense. (Havas, 13th)

Sydney Australian Prime Minister Menzies delivered a speech here today to various departments of the British Empire, stating that Australia will establish its own embassies in Washington and Tokyo as a preliminary step for cooperation between countries along the Pacific coast. "The position of the Pacific is becoming increasingly important, so Australia must have a separate diplomatic relationship with other Pacific countries in addition to its close relationship with Britain. Australia will act according to the will of Britain in European affairs, but the situation in the Pacific is completely different from that in Europe. What Britain's headquarters calls the 'Far East' is seen by us as the 'Near North.' I do not mean that the autonomous territories must separate from the mother country and become independent, but Australia's position in the Pacific is special, and it has its own need for independent action, but it is still a part of the British Empire and must still have close contact and cooperation with Britain, the South African Union, New Zealand, and Canada. However, Australia and New Zealand must have their own opportunities for independent action due to their special positions in the Pacific. The decision to establish embassies in Washington and Tokyo is a preliminary step for the union of Pacific countries. We will have closer diplomatic relations with the United States, China, and Japan." "Although Australia does not have a large population, its culture, minerals, and industry are all sufficient to make it a major country in the Pacific." (Associated Press dispatch, 14th)

### Emerging World Forces Revive Moral Rearmament Movement Hold International Congress in San Francisco Promote Transforming Lives and Transforming the World

(San Francisco Air Mail, August 2nd) The Christian Oxford Group was initiated a few years ago by Christians with reformist ideas in various European and American countries. Its first gathering was held at Oxford University in England, so it was named the "Oxford Group." The code of conduct it advocates has four points: absolute honesty, absolute purity, absolute unselfishness, and absolute love. It aims to take on the responsibility of reforming lives based on the spirit of Christ. This movement has now spread to countries all over the world. In the autumn of last year, when the situation in Europe was tense and the war crisis was imminent, the Oxford Group launched a moral rearmament movement and held the first international congress in Caux, Switzerland, to boost morale and save the world through spiritual power. Former British Prime Minister Baldwin, members of parliament from various parties in the British House of Lords and House of Commons, Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife of China, and US President Roosevelt all telegraphed their support. The US Senate also listed it in congressional documents. The moral rearmament movement has become a new opportunity for the modern life of various nations. On the first of this month, the Oxford Group held the second Moral Rearmament Congress at the World's Fair in San Francisco, USA. More than 1,000 male and female representatives from 25 countries attended. Dr. Buchman, the chairman, gave the opening speech, saying, "The time is urgent. The moral rearmament movement now wants to transform lives, transform nations, create new ideas, and new personalities in a timely manner. This movement does not want to establish a new church, but wants to transcend the narrow-mindedness of various churches, parties, and individuals, and make a determination to reform." Representatives from various countries spoke one after another. The Chinese delegation also gave a speech saying, "More than two thousand years ago, the great Chinese sage Confucius pointed out a revolutionary direction, saying, 'When things are investigated, knowledge is extended; when knowledge is extended, the will becomes sincere; when the will is sincere, the heart is rectified; when the heart is rectified, the person is cultivated; when the person is cultivated, the family is regulated; when the family is regulated, the state is governed; when the state is governed the world is at peach' We are now charged with the mission of putting into practice and promoting the truths enlightened by the sages, so as to reform lives, reform nations, and reform the world. This is also the mission undertaken by the moral rearmament movement. The Chinese delegation has come from across the Pacific to participate in this grand event, deeply believing that the unity of our nation, the transformation of society, the relief of refugees, and the displacement of tens of millions of people, all these problems can find their answers in this moral rearmament movement. We are here to follow in the footsteps of the advanced countries of Europe and the United States and train to become members of the vanguard of the world's reform. What we have seen and heard during our month in America is deeply moving. Now that we are packing our bags to return home, we vow to do our best to promote the spiritual revival of the Chinese nation as the foundation for our country's rejuvenation. Moreover, our country and our leaders are deeply loved by us. Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek and his wife recently sent a telegram from Chongqing, and we dare to read it to the attendees to express the enthusiasm of our country's highest authorities in supporting the moral rearmament movement. The telegram reads, 'We hear from afar your call to move lives and enthusiastically respond, deeply believing that this moral rearmament movement will surely reveal the innate conscience and ability of all nations and all thoughtful individuals.'"

He continued to meet with Minister Yuasa in another room, explained the government's policy towards Europe as decided at the Five Ministers' Conference on the 8th of this month, and expressed his personal beliefs. The two sides held important talks. Prime Minister Hiranuma is scheduled to return to Tokyo on the 15th. (Domei dispatch, 14th)

### German-Italian Talks Conclude, European Situation Becomes More Tense. Both Sides Reach a Compromise on General Issues. Germany Considers the Danzig Issue a Matter of Honor.

(Berlin) According to an official authorized message distributed to foreign newspapers regarding the talks between the Axis countries in Salzburg and Berchtesgaden, it states that Danzig is the most intense issue in the world today. The message reiterates the policies of Germany and Italy, stating that the two countries have now reached a complete compromise, and that the joint agreement of civil governments has made Poland's attitude increasingly tough. Therefore, Germany's glory and the treatment of the German people have been seriously affected. Unofficial sources with good information said that the talks between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, German leader Hitler, and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop have caused great unease. The Italian Foreign Minister has already flown back to Rome. Newspapers here are all explaining that the current tense situation does not show any signs of easing, and there is a tendency in the opposite direction. No one knows what was discussed in Berchtesgaden, and many pessimistic rumors have arisen. The most startling of these is that Hitler will deliver a speech to the nation on Tuesday, and German troops will set off that evening. What is noteworthy now is that what the German and Italian newspapers are talking about is the revision of the entire situation, not the solution of individual issues. Some people believe that the German-Italian talks lasted far longer than originally expected, which shows that the Axis countries did not fully agree with everything that is now said to have been agreed upon at the beginning. However, there are also less pessimistic rumors, such as the claim that Italy's opinion has largely taken hold. After the talks ended yesterday, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman told a Reuters reporter that as a result of the talks, Germany and Italy have completely compromised on all issues in the past, present, and future. The spokesman acknowledged that the Danzig issue had been discussed, but the date for its resolution had not yet been determined. Other European issues were also discussed at that time. No communiqué will be issued regarding this conversation, nor is there any plan to continue the meeting in the near future. The spokesman also said that all issues, large and small, were discussed in the talks and must and can be resolved. Complete agreement has been reached on the point of joint German-Italian action. The talks were not discussed with Britain, France, and other civil governments, because the Axis countries have determined that they can only effectively resolve the issues of justice and honor between themselves and their friends. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### Only Novel Point in Semi-Official Message

(Berlin) The semi-official message issued regarding the German-Italian talks was recently commented on by experienced observers, saying that it was already known that the Axis countries were determined to realize their demands, and therefore the only novel point in this message was that Germany regards the Danzig issue as a matter of honor. As to when and how Germany and Italy will move from words to actions, and whether Germany will take swift action on the Danzig issue, or whether it will suddenly raise other issues in other parts of Europe, such as the southeastern corner, all of these are still unknown. However, according to political figures, German and Italian military preparations can be completed within the next week, and the source of supplies to those countries is becoming increasingly difficult, and they also feel that the armaments of the civil governments are exceeding those of the Axis countries, and the time for them to do so is not far off. It can be said with certainty that they will take action early, although it is difficult to predict what kind of action it will be, but it will become clear in a short period of time. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### Compromise Reached on Diplomatic Policies of Two Countries

(Berlin) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano has been holding talks with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Salzburg for several days, and has repeatedly met with leader Hitler in Berchtesgaden. No official communiqué has been issued afterwards. Recently, a statement has been issued from semi-official circles here, which is sufficient to represent the views of responsible persons. It says that "during the talks, current political issues were discussed in an extremely friendly spirit, and a compromise was reached on the entire diplomatic policy of the two countries. It is universally believed that the issues can be resolved, and it is also necessary to resolve them. Among them, the issue of the Free City of Danzig occupies an important position in the world situation and was of course submitted for discussion. Regarding this matter, Poland's attitude is becoming increasingly tough because of the support of the civil governments, which is not only related to Germany's honor, but also makes it impossible to sit idly by and watch the Germans in Poland being abused. In short, the current policies of the German and Italian governments are completely consistent, and all issues have been submitted for discussion without omission, so there is no need to continue the talks in the near future, and what is said by foreign parties is a misunderstanding of the truth." (According to outside reports, there is a possibility of a meeting between Hitler and Mussolini.) The friendship between the German and Italian nations is unbreakable, and they will jointly defend their interests. All of this has been clearly demonstrated in this conversation. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

(Rome) Political figures here have expressed satisfaction with the outcome of Foreign Minister Ciano's talks with German leader Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, and said that the complete agreement between the foreign policies of the two Axis countries, Germany and Italy, has been clarified by the semi-official German message. The various rumors have been debunked. It is noteworthy that the message states that the current various issues, including the issue of the Free City of Danzig, can be resolved. The message also says that Germany and Italy do not need to continue talking at this time, and that Germany and Italy are moving hand in hand towards their ideal of justice. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### German Navy Commander-in-Chief Criticizes Britain and Praises German Military Strength

Trier, Germany Navy Commander-in-Chief Raeder delivered a speech at the Naval Association here, strongly stating that Germany is powerful and unafraid of war, saying, "Germany is now facing the threat of encirclement, the same as in 1914. The intention of the encirclementists is to force Germany to accept a treaty even more severe than the Treaty of Versailles, so that the name of Germany will no longer be on the world map. The culprit is still Britain. In fact, this is Britain's delusion and will surely fail. Leader Hitler has given the German nation strong armaments, not only with sharp weapons, but also with those who use them are precisely trained, supplemented by a strong spirit, and will surely overcome the enemy. In addition, the policy pursued by Leader Hitler is ingenious, and our country has thus obtained strong and reliable allies and friends. If the enemy countries destroy peace, they will either send troops to help or maintain benevolent neutrality. For this reason, our nation fully trusts its own strength and Leader Hitler, and looks forward to the future with peace of mind. Even if war comes, we are not afraid." (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### Labor Disputes Increasing in Japan

(Tokyo) Labor unrest this year has greatly increased compared to previous years. This can be evidenced by the number of strikes. Although the authorities have invoked the National Mobilization Law to severely control labor, strikes still occur from time to time and are likely to continue to occur in the future. There are two main factors: (1) The Sino-Japanese War has caused a large expansion of Japanese industry, and large companies have participated in large numbers, and their power is increasing. (2) Small businesses and medium-sized trading companies have been increasingly unable to find capital and have been excluded and lost their jobs. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)

### Germany Denies Italy Put Forward Peace Plan

(Berlin) German government sources last night said that the meetings held in Salzburg and Berchtesgaden, Germany, last week included issues on the Far East, colonial issues, and the European situation. According to reports, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Prime Minister Hitler and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, when the conference, the Italian agreed to aid the German policy on the Danzig. However, the Nazi Party has indicated that Germany has not announced the right of Germany, this summer, to acquire Danzig into Greater Germany. The German side of government does not recognize that Minister Ciano submitted an ambitious European Peace plan to Prime Minister Hitler. The German semi-official news agency Deutsche Telekom reported that Germany and Italy were for the summit in Salzburg and Bertschesgaden on various issues regarding the the diplomatic policy of the Berlin-Rome axis. The news agency announced, "The Danzig issue occupies an important position in the conference, which is the most important of all issues. On a variety of issues, both parties are in 100 percent agreement." The new agency said that minister Ciano and minister Ribbentrop will conduct follow-up discussion soon regarding the policies of the two countries and were exhausted. Minister Ciano yesterday had a final conference with Prime Minister Hitler, for three quarters of an hour. He left Bertschesgaden to Salzburg and with the German foreign minister Ribbentrop had lunch. Following lunch, together they went to the airport where Ciano immediately embarked on an airplane to Rome. (Associated Press dispatch, 14th)

### Compromise Method for Resolving Danzig Dispute

(Paris) According to Le Figaro, it is rumored in Warsaw that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano proposed the following compromise method to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop for resolving the Danzig dispute: (1) Abolish the position of the League of Nations Commissioner stationed in Danzig. (2) Abolish the Polish General Affairs Office stationed in the Free City and replace it with a diplomatic commission to protect Polish interests. (3) Revise the charter of Danzig as a Free City, with all administrative personnel being German. (4) Gradually clear the customs borders between Danzig and Germany over a period of five years. (5) Germany, with international public guarantee, demilitarizes Danzig, at which time Poland also removes its armory on the Westerplatte Peninsula. (6) The port is managed by an independent port authority, which includes representatives from Poland, Danzig, and Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)

### Italian Foreign Minister Ciano Flies Back to Rome

(Rome) Foreign Minister Ciano flew back here from Salzburg, Austria, this evening and immediately reported to Prime Minister Mussolini on the results of his talks with leader Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. In addition, German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen also returned on the same plane as the Foreign Minister. (Havas dispatch, 13th)

### Göring's Newspaper Discusses Partitioning Poland

(Berlin) The Essener National Zeitung, the official newspaper of Air Minister General Göring, recently published an article on Polish history with very strong language. It roughly stated, "The Poland of 1939 is no different from the Poland of 1782. Frankly speaking, it only serves to disgrace civilization and endanger European peace, bringing misfortune to the residents of Europe. Back in 1782, the partitioning of Poland by its neighboring countries (namely Prussia, Austria, and Russia) was indeed a wise measure, and it was politically necessary. Truly, Poland is a semi-Asian country, prone to betrayal, so for the sake of safeguarding Central European civilization, it was necessary to partition it." Now, the rights of the Polish people and various ethnic minorities within Poland are being deprived by military dictators. They may regret not having recalled the rule of Prussia, Austria, and Russia in the past. (Havas, 14th)

### Tianjin Four Chinese Extradition Issue: Ambassador Guo Negotiates with Britain; Britain Repeatedly Makes Concessions to Japan; Newspapers Sharply Criticize

(London) According to sources here, the Chinese government has protested to British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr regarding Britain's decision to extradite the four suspects from Tianjin. It is also rumored that the Chinese government has telegraphed Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi, urging him to do his utmost to reverse this matter. It is heard that Mr. Guo is scheduled to visit Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cadogan today. Reuters has learned that Mr. Guo will emphasize the intense emotions of China and the entire Chinese population regarding this matter. The British government's decision regarding the four suspects has again made people in the Far East fear that Britain may eventually hand over the Chinese silver currently held in various banks in the British Concession in Tianjin to the Japanese. Although key opposition members in the House of Commons are not in London at the moment, influential figures from all sectors are continuing to make private appeals to the British government. The amount of silver currently in the Tianjin British Concession and who it belongs to remains a mystery. It is said that the total amount is over 50 million yuan, with only 13 million yuan stored in the British Concession and the rest stored in the French Concession or the Banque Franco-Chinoise in Beiping. This sum was deposited by the Central Government's Currency Reserve Board in 1935. The ambassadors of Britain and France are paying particular attention to this deposit, and the Reserve Board has also requested that the funds be protected regardless of the situation. According to the Financial Times, the British government has received the opinions of France and the United States regarding the issue of Chinese legal tender in North China. It is expected that the opinions of other signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty will also arrive sooner or later. (Reuters, 14th)

(London) The News Chronicle said in an editorial today that if Parliament were not in recess, there would certainly be sharp criticism of the government's decision to transfer the four Chinese from Tianjin to the Japanese. This decision to show weakness has, as expected, not led to a better spirit in Anglo-Japanese relations. The monster with three heads and a tail is now swallowing a pacifier and preparing to seize the next food. One selfless citizen of Britain has now initiated legal action to protect these four Chinese. What is regrettable for British justice is that resorting to the law comes from private action alone. The British government must now feel that this legal procedure is a major obstacle. The Manchester Guardian said that the government is now anxiously using the judge as a talisman, but even the judge's own power cannot prevent the decision to transfer the four Chinese from being a despicable act. Britain has again made concessions to the Japanese. This is a clear fact. The concessions are not just once, but have been made repeatedly. The Japanese originally claimed that if the four Chinese were not handed over, they would blockade the British Concession in Tianjin. Now Britain has handed over the four Chinese, but the blockade has not been lifted. The Daily Telegraph, under the headline "After Two Years of War," said that the Japanese military representative attending the Anglo-Japanese conference returned to Tianjin quickly, and the increasingly fierce anti-British movement in North China did not encourage the hope that the Tokyo talks could achieve satisfactory results soon. However, there is no other way to go but to continue talking, in order to allow Japan, which claims to be responsible for maintaining order in the Chinese occupied territories, to achieve its goals. Japan wants to expand the scope of the Tokyo talks to include the issue of banning the use of legal tender in North China and confiscating Chinese silver deposits in Tianjin. Japan may think that the China incident has replaced the Nine-Power Treaty, which hinders Chinese territorial and administrative integrity, but in Britain, the treaty is still valid and does not allow unilateral action. Two years after the war, the possibility of Japan establishing a peaceful regime in China is even more remote than at the beginning of the war. Japan's control does not extend beyond the range of its guns, but Japan's economy has not yet shown signs of collapse. The increasingly tense situation in the Far East must be attributed to Japan's strategy. If Japan's repeated statements that the rights of all countries in China will be fully respected were not accompanied by the fact that these rights are disregarded in any disposition where its military gains victory, then their value would be great. The newspaper also strongly stated that the Chinese people have forged a nation under this blow, capable of heroic sacrifice to defend the territory still ruled by Chairman Chiang. The newspaper concluded by saying that although Japan has issued a declaration that it will not negotiate with Chairman Chiang on any basis, there is no possibility of achieving peace without the approval of the Chinese side. The Chinese government has never been seen and is even less willing to discuss conditions at this time. (Reuters, 14th)

### Poland's Attitude Firm; Vigilance Against Germany Unwavering; League of Nations High Commissioner Returns to Danzig; Met with Hitler to Discuss the Danzig Issue

(London) Sources close to the Foreign Office here recently announced that League of Nations High Commissioner for the Free City of Danzig, Carl Jacob Burckhardt, had informed the League of Nations Council's Three-Member Committee (composed of representatives from Britain, France, and Sweden, responsible for monitoring the situation in Danzig) last week that he had been invited by the German side to visit Berchtesgaden. He then went there and met with Führer Hitler. He has now returned to the Free City of Danzig and will be in contact with the City Council and the Polish High Commissioner separately, hoping to contribute to the resolution of the Danzig issue. The British Foreign Office has not yet received a report on the details of his conversation with Führer Hitler. (Havas, 14th)

Warsaw According to reliable sources, League of Nations High Commissioner for the Free City of Danzig, Carl Jacob Burckhardt, has arrived in Germany and will meet with Führer Hitler to discuss the Danzig issue. Some political figures here recently commented on this matter, saying that Führer Hitler is still hesitating about what peaceful means Germany will use to take back the city of Danzig, so he wants to discuss with Burckhardt whether a compromise solution acceptable to both Poland and Germany can be found. It can be seen from the fact that after Burckhardt arrived in Germany, the tone of the German newspapers towards Poland has softened slightly. Other political figures believe that from now until the end of this month, when Führer Hitler delivers a speech in the city of Namburg in East Prussia to commemorate the victory of the Battle of Tannenberg in the Great War, relations between Poland and Germany will probably become increasingly tense. The Polish government also believes that the situation is still serious and that vigilance is still necessary. In short, those close to the government all say that the Polish authorities have a firm attitude and will not be moved by empty threats. No matter how fierce Hitler's speech is, they will not be afraid. At this time, they are closely monitoring the movements of German troops along the border and taking appropriate precautions. (Havas, 13th)

Warsaw Regarding the Polish clerks in the Free City of Danzig (issue of authority), the Polish High Commissioner to the Free City, Chodacki, will begin talks with City Council Chairman Greiser tomorrow. (Havas, 13th)

(Berlin) The authorities here have not denied the news that League of Nations High Commissioner for the City of Danzig, Carl Jacob Burckhardt, went to Berchtesgaden to meet with Führer Hitler, but they said that the rumor that Führer Hitler planned to convene the Reichstag tomorrow to deliver an important speech is not true. (Havas, 14th)

### Guangxi Inspects Wartime Military Strength; Province Divided into Eight Major Defense Zones; Military Organs Form Inspection Committee

Guilin correspondence, the Southwest Headquarters, in order to strengthen Guangxi's anti-Japanese strength, has specially divided Guangxi Province into eight major defense zones: (1) Guilin Pingle Zone, (2) Xunzhou Zone, (3) Liuqing Zone, (4) Baise Tianbao Zone, (5) Yongwu Zone, (6) Longzhou Zone, Yulin Zone, (7) Wuzhou Zone. Each zone has a number of regular troops, militia self-defense forces, special forces, and guerrilla forces. All kinds of new non-metallic artillery, military equipment, horses, and equipment are available, and the equipment is extremely detailed. The highest military authorities in Guangxi also believe that it is necessary to thoroughly inspect the province's anti-Japanese military strength, including the training of new troops and various teams, the management of personnel hygiene and internal affairs, and the equipment and storage of weapons, horses, and equipment. Yesterday, a meeting of senior military officers was specially convened to jointly form an inspection committee and formulate methods. Staff will be dispatched monthly to conduct detailed inspections of each training zone once. The inspection personnel are divided into three groups, each with one group leader and one deputy group leader. The troops directly under the Pacification Headquarters, military control zones, militia zones, and various teams are listed as one group, the troops directly under the command of the No. ×× Group Army Headquarters and the entire No. ××× Army are the second group, and the entire No. ××× Army is the third group. Committees are set up under the groups to be in charge of various matters. After the leaders of each group are organized and assigned, they will be assigned to various inspection areas to conduct inspections separately. The committee members for each zone are: Lu Jingcun for the Guilin Pingle Zone, Li Zhukuang for the Xunzhou Zone, Jiang Bolun for the Liuzhou Qingyuan Zone, Xie Zongkeng for the Baise Tianbao Zone, Wei Liantang for the Yongning Ya Zone, Li Chaofang for the Longzhou Zone, Liu Qingfan for the Yulin Zone, and Li Jinjie for the Wuzhou Zone. In addition to supervising and inspecting the above-mentioned items, the committee members in each zone will also conduct detailed inspections of the national defense works, troop deployment, mobilization preparation, guerrilla zone planning, road destruction, clearing the fields, promotion of conscription, organization of militias, and maintenance of public security in each zone, so as to make the entire province a center of overall anti-Japanese military strength.

### In the Raging Torrent; The Loss of Fir Timber on the Min River is Very Significant; Annual Production Value Reaches Seven Million Yuan; This Loss Reaches More Than One Million

Fuzhou correspondence, among the seven major specialties of Fujian, fir timber ranks second. The production quantity and value are second only to tea. The fir timber producing areas include the Min River basin, which includes Pucheng, Jian'ou, Shaowu, Jiangle, Yong'an, Shaxian, Nanping, Youxi, Datian, Pingnan, Dehua, Yongtai, and other counties; the Ting River basin, which includes Liancheng, Wuping, Shanghang, Yongding, and other counties, Zhangping and other counties; and other basins, which include Pinghe, Ningde, and other counties. Among them, Youxi and Yongtai in the Min River basin, and Zhangping in the Long River basin, have the highest production volume. The fir timber from the Min River basin is all transported to Fuzhou and then sold to various places. The fir timber from the Ting River basin is mostly transferred to Chaozhou and Shantou via Longxi. The value of the products is approximately seven million yuan.

The method of harvesting and transporting is that the timber firms go to various mountains to purchase timber at the end of each winter with money. The timbermen who harvest and transport fir timber in the deep mountains and valleys sell the fir timber to the timber firms in cylinders. The value of each cylinder (i.e., each log) depends on the size of the end diameter, but generally, a cylinder with a diameter of about three feet is worth between two yuan and five jiao and three yuan. After the timber firms purchase the timber, because the timber cylinders are heavy and cannot be transported by human power, they entrust them to the nearby large and small streams in the valleys and use the power of spring and summer rainwater to release them into the large rivers. However, the streams are small and shallow, and the water power is not enough to float the timber cylinders, so simple earth dams are built every thirty or forty steps along the banks of the streams to store stream water for floating the timber. The construction of the dams is extremely simple, only three or five fir cylinders are horizontally stacked or vertically erected in the streams, and the gaps between the cylinders are filled with a mixture of mud and green grass to make them waterproof. The number of earth dams along the banks of each small stream often reaches dozens or two to three hundred.

When the timber cylinders are released to the riverside, the river is wide and deep, and they can be sealed and nailed into rafts and transported to various destinations by tide. This is the situation of the timber cylinders being formed and harvested.

The formation of timber rafts is all at the turn of spring and summer, when torrents often rise and mountain floods inundate. Houses are turned into ruins, and the earth dams of small streams are washed away and swept away. The timber cylinders on the riverside are even more difficult to escape the disaster. Rafts of timber cylinders, both assembled and unassembled, flow downstream with the waves, and many of them flow down the Min River and into the sea. Occasionally, a few cunning merchants take advantage of the flood season to release rafts downstream in the hope of avoiding taxes, which is also not uncommon.

This year, there have been four mountain floods, just when Japanese warships were blockading the estuary. The timber firms were hesitant about the difficulty of exporting, and the flood disaster that was difficult to prevent by human power caused unprecedented losses. According to relevant parties, the cumulative total is more than 200,000 cylinders. At an average of five yuan per cylinder, the value is 1.3 million national currency, which is truly a great disaster.

Most of the timber cylinders flowing downstream are salvaged by villagers along the river. According to past customs, a group of timber merchants jointly organized a "Fir Timber Merchant Salvage and Management Office" and set up agencies in various counties, districts, and towns along the river to be responsible for salvage and preparing prices for redemption. This is the method of post-disaster remedy. The value of the redeemed timber depends on the size of the end diameter for scattered cylinders, averaging from two jiao to three jiao per cylinder. For complete rafts, only a little more than one jiao per cylinder is redeemed.

This year, the mountain floods were connected to flash floods, and the water势 was fierce, flowing into the sea in large numbers. However, there were very few salvagers along the river. Moreover, some local bullies in Jiangkou, Pukou, Shadi, and other villages under the jurisdiction of Minhou County took the opportunity to seize and destroy the timber for firewood. The number of timber cylinders that were destroyed after having their markings removed and resold also reached fifty to sixty thousand. The number of timber cylinders redeemed by the timber firms and salvaged by themselves was only half of the number that was lost.

Fir timber is one of the special products of Fujian Province and is extremely important to the economy of Fujian Province. It is heard that the authorities have strictly ordered the governments of various counties along the river to carefully plan and arrange post-disaster measures and to strictly prohibit the seizure of driftwood in order to benefit timber merchants.

### The Japanese Troops Disturbing Fujian; Various Actions After Landing on Pingtan; Bandit Leader Appointed as Puppet Commander-in-Chief; Many Civilians Detained and Abused

Fuzhou correspondence, since the Japanese troops landed on Pingtan on July 5, the local order has been extremely chaotic. According to refugees who escaped from Pingtan, on the 5th, more than 300 Japanese troops and bandits, under the cover of five Japanese warships and four airplanes, landed on the island. At that time, the sound of cannons rumbled and the sound of aircraft screeched, and Pingtan immediately fell into a war terror. The Chinese self-defense forces bravely fought back while urging evacuation. They only withdrew after the task was completed. After the Japanese troops landed, they immediately occupied various organs and appointed Yu Xiahao, the leader of the bandits who had let the wolf into the house, as the puppet commander-in-chief of the Fujian Allied Army, colluding with the Japanese to carry out activities everywhere. Most of Yu's troops were bandits from the Fuping area, and they were extremely familiar with the local situation. Whenever they arrived at a house, they would first check the household registration. If there were any strong young men missing, they would insist that the strong young men had joined a certain unit of the Chinese army's self-defense forces and would detain all the women, children, and elderly in the family. Women accounted for the majority of those detained. As for the elderly and children, they would occasionally release one or two if they were offered a large sum of money, but this was rare. Even after being released, they would be covered in bruises and have suffered severe torture. Moreover, after the elderly, children, and women in this family were detained, all the valuables in this family would soon be taken away. The local order in Pingtan is now extremely chaotic. Most of the refugees who failed to escape could not withstand the various oppressions and have been fleeing at risk. However, the Japanese are actively trying to win over a group of local ruffians to carry out the work of the puppet organization. Lin Shaoping, Cai Kenan, Lin Guangzhi, and others, who have committed many evils on weekdays and are despised by the people of Pingtan, have been elevated to positions of power and are acting on stage. Lin Shaoping was appointed as the puppet magistrate of Pingtan County, and Cai Kenan, Lin Guangzhi, and others were appointed to other important puppet positions. There are currently only more than 30 Japanese troops stationed in Pingtan, and the rest are all bandits. Recently, rumors of a counterattack by the Chinese self-defense forces have been very intense, and the bandits are restless and panicked. The puppet allied army headquarters and the puppet county government are connected together, and a large cannon and a machine gun are placed at the door for strict defense. After the refugee finished speaking, he also said that his aunt had been robbed from her home by bandits a decade ago, and there has been no news of her since. His words seemed to be filled with unspeakable sadness and indignation.

### Fate of the Four Chinese in Tianjin; Awaiting Judgment by British Court; Judge Jones Still Studying Carefully; Situation Urgent and Judgment Will Be Made Today; Plaintiffs May Have to Appeal to England

The extradition case of the four Chinese in Tianjin requested by the Japanese, which is related to the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo, saw the British government issue an order on the night of the 11th to transfer the four suspects from the British Concession authorities in Tianjin to the "North China regime" there. Just as the international community was astonished by the British move, the British Supreme Court in this city appropriately received a telegram from Professor Bentwich of the Department of International Relations at the University of Jerusalem and Miss Florence, director of the BBC, through the famous British lawyer Mr. Lykes of the law office of Ellis in this city, requesting a writ of habeas corpus. Therefore, the attention of all parties concerned about the extradition case of the four Chinese in Tianjin has once again been focused on how the British Supreme Court will decide. The following is a record of the various news items obtained yesterday:

Judgment May Be Announced Today

After the petition was filed with the British Supreme Court, Judge Jones运日 studied the case in detail, and debated the petition with Mr. Lykes, the lawyer, on the afternoon of the 12th. Yesterday, Judge Jones continued to study the reasons given by the defense lawyers in the case. As of last night, the British Supreme Court had not announced any judgment on the case, nor had any official documents related to the case been made public. It is generally expected that because this case urgently needs to be dealt with in terms of the situation, the judgment document may be announced today (15th).

Appeal to England in Case of Failure

Those concerned about the case are still unable to find out how the Supreme Court will rule. However, according to news from Western sources, if the Supreme Court believes that the request for a "writ of habeas corpus" filed by the petitioners is appropriate, it will proceed along this path. If the Supreme Court rejects this request, the petitioners will continue to appeal to the High Court in London, England, in order to implement the original intention of their request.

Interpretation of Writ of Habeas Corpus

The English-language Great American Evening Post said that regarding the extradition of the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin to the Japanese authorities in the city, the "writ of habeas corpus" submitted to the British Supreme Court in Shanghai last week, the so-called writ of habeas corpus, is a writ issued by the High Court in accordance with English law, ordering the recipient of the writ to send the person detained by him to the High Court or other court for interrogation, in order to protect human rights and terminate all illegal imprisonment. It is a remedy for the destruction of individual freedom. The case has not yet been judged yesterday. It is reported that this judgment was requested by the defense lawyer Mr. Lykes to Judge Jones. Judge Jones is still studying the matter this (14th) morning and may announce the judgment document tomorrow (15th).

This Case is Unique in China

The Shanghai Times said that the petition filed by the two lawyers Mr. Jones and Mr. Lykes of the famous English lawyer Ellis's office to Judge Jones of the British Supreme Court in China on Saturday and Sunday is generally considered to be unique in British legal proceedings in China, and perhaps the fate of the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin is at stake. Not only in Shanghai, but also in London and Tokyo, the greatest concern is awaiting judgment.

British Handover Arouses Criticism

It is reported that this petition is related to the four Chinese in the assassination case of a Chinese official of the "Provisional Government" several months ago. These suspects are currently being detained by the British authorities in Tianjin. The transfer of these suspects to the Japanese military and the authorities of the "Provisional Government" in Beiping has always been opposed by the British authorities, and in the past week or so, it has become part of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo. The British government's decision to hand over the suspects has caused some criticism in Britain. Professor Bentwich of the Department of International Relations and Miss Florence, director of the BBC, have also risen up to oppose it.

Jones' Verdict is Very Important

On Friday and Sunday nights, a telegram was received from Miss Bentwich and Miss Florence, asking to submit a one-sided petition, requesting a conditional judgment on the writ of habeas corpus. This petition was submitted to Judge Jones on Saturday and Sunday mornings, and Jones and Lykes debated this petition throughout the afternoon of Saturday and Sunday. Judge Jones subsequently postponed the judgment. Considering the urgency of the situation, it is necessary to make a judgment immediately. It is believed that Judge Jones will make a judgment today (14th) or tomorrow (15th). This petition requests that a writ of habeas corpus be issued to the police officers of the Tianjin British Concession's Municipal Council who detained the four suspects. It is generally believed that if a conditional judgment is issued, the judgment may be required to be implemented, or it may make it independent and self-existent. Therefore, it is believed that Judge Jones's judgment is very important.

### Some Faculty and Staff Call for Salary Increase; Request for Increased Tuition Fees to Compensate for Shortfalls

Dai Yangren, Jin Jing, Zhou Jintao, Li Chunyi, Zhu Huaifu, Dai Zhijiang, and more than 100 others in the education field in this city, in view of the fact that in this time of soaring prices, it is difficult for most workers in the education field to maintain a livelihood, specially expressed their opinions on this matter in a joint statement, saying that since the outbreak of the war two years ago, in addition to the original schools in Shanghai, the schools in the occupied areas have also moved to Shanghai one after another to find houses and open schools, so that the music of learning will not be interrupted, fulfilling their responsibilities to society and the country. Usually, the colleagues of each school are able to overcome difficulties in the spirit of mutual assistance, but at present, foreign exchange has shrunk sharply, and the prices of clothing, food, housing, and transportation have successively increased by 50% to 80%. Most factories and companies have successively increased the salaries of their employees to make up for the losses. Looking back at the education field, which has always been very poor, most people live in a state of semi-starvation. At this extraordinary time, some even find it difficult to maintain a minimum standard of living, let alone support their families. They think that they are drinking "well water" to survive, but even "tap water" is also increasing in price. We say from an objective and fair standpoint that at present, teachers are indeed the same as other civil servants and need to increase their salaries. Even the schools themselves need to increase their income in order to cope with expenses. Some people say that increasing tuition fees will increase the burden on families, but as long as you keep your head calm, you will realize that because the original salaries of the general salary-earning class have increased, it is not unreasonable to increase some expenses. If his family originally belonged to the wealthy bourgeoisie, then it is even less of a problem. Society can distribute reasonably in this way, which is in line with the economic principle of "balanced revenue and expenditure." May I ask, how can a teacher's life be unstable, and how can he work with peace of mind? Therefore, in our opinion, it is indeed necessary to immediately launch a salary increase for the teachers and staff of general schools whose salaries are below the standard. Schools may wish to appropriately increase tuition fees to compensate for the shortfall, otherwise, if all industries increase salaries, but the education field is left out, it will inevitably be unfair, making it impossible for ordinary teachers and staff who are already poor to make a living. We hope that social public groups and enthusiastic people will actively provide relief.

### Shanghai-Ningbo Line Ships Set Up Ticket Office in Zhenhai

Shanghai-Ningbo line ships, concentrated outside Zhenhai port, were experiencing delays due to the time-consuming barge transfers. To facilitate passengers, each shipping line has specially established a ticket office in Zhenhai and hired designated barges for orderly boarding and transfer to ensure safety. Strictly prohibiting rushing and disorder.

### Authorities of Two Concessions Lifted Alert Last Night; No Accidents Occurred on the 6th; City Streets to Return to Normal Starting This Morning

The police authorities of the two concessions in this city, in order to maintain order and tranquility during the [Shanghai] War Anniversary period, had jointly announced and implemented a temporary emergency alert since the 9th. In addition to regulating or restricting traffic on all major roads, all vehicles and pedestrians were strictly inspected. Furthermore, all police forces were dispatched to assist the defense forces of various districts and countries, as well as the Merchant Corps Volunteers, patrolling back and forth on all roads in patrol cars and armored vehicles, day and night, which was very arduous. The area around the newspaper offices was even more specially and thoroughly guarded. Therefore, peace has been maintained in recent days. The police authorities expressed deep satisfaction with this. In consideration of the city's situation, they officially announced the lifting of the emergency alert order starting at 10:00 PM last night. All obstacles and sandbags will also be removed accordingly. However, ordinary alerts, routine patrols, and temporary inspections will still be carried out as usual. As for the curfew, it is still being strictly enforced.

Ample Police Force, Peaceful Order

The police authorities of the two concessions, in order to prevent the second anniversary of the Shanghai War and ensure peace within the boundaries, decided after consultation with merchants to begin special alerts on the morning of the 9th. All roads and alleys along the borders of the British and French concessions, except for those necessary, were completely blocked, cutting off traffic. All police personnel were dispatched to patrol and search. On the 12th and 13th, troops stationed from various countries, as well as the International Merchant Volunteers, were mobilized and deployed in different areas. The situation was extremely tense. Due to the abundance of the authorities' police force and the strictness of the precautions, the anniversary of the Shanghai War was passed peacefully. Yesterday was the 14th, and the two concessions continued the alert for one more day, but the situation has eased.

Ordinary Alert to Continue

It is also learned that the authorities of the two concessions, considering the current state of emergency, the surge in population in Shanghai, and the complexity of the elements, while announcing the lifting of the special alert starting this morning, the ordinary alert will continue as usual. The original patrol teams of each police station will still be dispatched as usual to search pedestrians to maintain order within the boundaries.

North of the Suzhou Creek, Alert Not Relaxed

Yesterday, the alert on the north side of the Suzhou Creek bridge was still quite strict. For example, the New Rubbish Bridge and the Pentang Alley Bridge were still being continuously blocked. The Old Rubbish Bridge was still only open to vehicles, and the Old Gate Bridge was only open to pedestrians. Both ends of the bridge were guarded and inspected by detectives. Although the Tianhou Palace Bridge was open to both pedestrians and vehicles, iron wire racks were placed on the bridge, and inspections were also very strict. The newly blocked area by the Japanese on North Jiangxi Road still only had an opening at the Haining Road intersection, which could be accessed with a newly issued pass. The concession authorities at the west end have blocked all horizontal roads and alleys, with only the west entrance of Haining Road and the west entrance of Qipu Road accessible to that road. The iron gates on North Henan Road, North Shanxi Road, and Keneng Road leading to the concession road were all closed. The iron gate at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Erjin Road was also closed. However, there was a gap on the east side of the iron gate that could be used to enter and exit, leading to the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and the concession road. The intersection of Erjin Road and North Zhejiang Road was still blocked. Therefore, trams on Routes 5, 6, and 7 only went to the entrance of the First Special Court. Due to the blocking of the New Rubbish Bridge, trolleybuses on Route 18, when arriving at the Nicheng Bridge, turned to Beijing Road, passed the Tianhou Palace Bridge, and reached the Old Parade Ground intersection, temporarily changing their route.

Arrest of Hooligans, Deportation

In the past two days, the French police have arrested a total of sixty to seventy unemployed hooligans in the areas of East New Bridge, West New Bridge, and Zilaihuo Street. After being taken to the police station for investigation, it was found that these individuals had committed extortion cases and had previously received criminal punishments. The police authorities believed that in this tense situation, if these individuals were tolerated and released, it would have a great impact on local order. Therefore, it has been decided to deport all of them in order to maintain security within the boundaries.

### Fuel Prices Rise, Coal Market Stable, Publicly Agreed Coal Ball Prices

The coal market previously suffered from the impact of the black market foreign exchange squeeze, and prices of all goods were raised across the board, order was chaotic, and transactions were suspended. It is understood that the market has a total of more than 200 participating firms, opening at 1:00 PM every day and closing at 3:00 PM. Now the market has stabilized due to the relaxation of the foreign exchange situation and increased sources. However, Japanese coal is active in the market, attempting to compete with foreign coal sales, and its prices are also lower.

Coal Ball Prices Rise

The Coal Ball Industry Association convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the afternoon of the 11th of this month due to the recent soaring prices of coal dross in the coal market, increasing the cost for industry members. The results of the meeting were: (1) The wholesale price increased from 55 yuan and 54 yuan to 62 yuan per ton; (2) The retail price increased from 3 yuan to 3.4 yuan per 100 market catties. However, the repeated soaring prices of coal balls have greatly harmed the common people.

Firewood and Charcoal Stagnant

Various kinds of firewood and charcoal needed by the citizens of this city have always been purchased by members of the Firewood and Charcoal Industry Association who are sent to Wenzhou and Huangyan, Zhejiang, and other places. Since the blockade of the Oujiang River in Wenzhou, the source of firewood and charcoal has been interrupted. Fortunately, there were sufficient reserves, so there was not much impact. For more than two months, the reserves have decreased, and the source has been stagnant. They are all transported to Shanghai via Ningbo and Zhenhai, increasing costs. Prices of all goods have uniformly increased by 10% to 20%.

### Fighting Near Xin Zhuang, Chinese Army's 45th Brigade Marches Directly to Jiashan, Villages Along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line Burned Terribly

The waterway traffic between Shanghai and Pinghu, with the Shanghai-Pinghu liner composed of Chinese but fronted by Japanese businesses, still only operates as far as Zhujing in Jinshan County. Above Zhujing, because the Chinese army in charge has implemented blockades in Xintai, Langxia, Luxiang and other places, allowing only sampans and sailboats to enter and exit, scheduled sailings cannot resume. Therefore, Zhujing Town has essentially become a transfer checkpoint between Shanghai and Pinghu. According to news from the shipping industry, the 45th Brigade of the Chinese Regular Army, which is active on the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border, a few days ago joined forces with the Chinese army in the Sujia region and attacked Jiashan in two routes, making a bold move to cut off the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. Jiashan suffered successive defeats due to the thin Japanese forces, closing the city gates and holding firm. The Chinese army marched directly under the city walls, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road was also cut off, besieging the city walls for a day and a night. Only after Japanese reinforcements arrived did they move towards the surrounding countryside.

Casualties on Both Sides on the West Side of Shanghai. According to a miscellaneous grain merchant from Qibao to Shanghai, before dawn the day before yesterday, a certain unit of the Chinese guerrillas in the Wujiatang area, north of Xin Zhuang Station and south of Qibao on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, engaged in a surprise battle with the Japanese army coming from the west of Hongqiao Road. Both sides fired fiercely with light and heavy machine guns, and the gunfire was as dense as continuous beads. Initially, the Japanese army, caught off guard by the strong enemy, suffered some casualties and retreated slightly. Soon, a large Japanese reinforcement arrived and fired small steel cannons to assist in the battle. The Chinese side, due to its thin forces and lack of ammunition, began to disperse and retreat in order to preserve its strength. The fierce battle lasted for as long as three hours. Although the Japanese army suffered heavy losses, the Chinese side also suffered great sacrifices. Unexpectedly, after all the Chinese guerrillas had retreated, the Japanese army set fire to the villages near Wujiatang, burning them down. In an instant, the fire blazed into the sky, and cries shook the ground. In addition to the innocent farmers who were killed by stray bullets due to their inability to escape during the fierce battle, a portion of the women and children died while defending their homes and ended up being buried in the fire. Those who saw it were saddened, those who heard it shed tears. There is no hell on earth as tragic as this.

Villages Northwest of Xin Zhuang Looted. A certain team under Xu Xinzhou's command of the 3rd Regiment of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Team was recently ordered to move from a certain place to Chujiatang in the southwest of Qibao (about three or four miles northwest of Xin Zhuang) in order to attack the Japanese army headquarters at Xin Zhuang Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road. Unexpectedly, the plan was not secret and was discovered by the Japanese army, who immediately dispatched a large unit of more than 100 Japanese soldiers to the address around 4:00 AM on the morning of the 13th, surrounding Chujiatang on all sides, using small copper cannons and heavy machine guns to bombard it. Xu's brave soldiers were all awakened from their dreams and hastily resisted. However, the artillery fire was fierce and difficult to resist, and the disparity in strength was too great to win. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, they ordered a retreat after fighting fiercely until about 6:00 AM. In this battle, the Japanese side suffered six or seven deaths, and Xu's platoon leader, Jin Qiugen (25 years old, from Miaoren, Beihua Village, Meilong Town) was killed, and more than ten people were injured. The Japanese soldiers then moved into the three villages of Chujiatang, Wujiatang, and Matong Bridge, searching house by house, and shooting innocent civilians. The Japanese army only left at 4:00 PM.

Two Armies Engaged in a Long and Fierce Battle. Also, it is reported that Wengban Bridge Town, which belongs to Shanghai County, was suddenly visited by a large unit of Japanese troops stationed in Xin Zhuang, carrying small steel cannons and other equipment, who rushed to [blank], conducting strict searches. They then searched various villages such as Zhujiatang, Shengjiaxiang, Sunjia's graveyard, and Luowang Temple near the town. As a result, a small number of discarded guns and residual bullets were found and taken away. However, when the Japanese army first arrived in the town, they indiscriminately bombarded it, causing three villagers to be hit by stray bullets and die from their injuries one after another. The surrounding area is now in a serious situation, and many residents are fleeing. In a certain village between Qibao and Xin Zhuang, Chinese guerrillas and the Japanese army engaged in a surprise battle the day before yesterday. The sound of artillery and guns was constantly heard for about two or three hours before gradually subsiding. Later, according to those who came from the area, a large unit of Japanese troops went to support from Xin Zhuang, and it is estimated that the fighting there will inevitably be fierce.

Vegetables in Pudong Will Be Sold Under Control Starting Tomorrow; Annual Production Reaches 400,000 to 500,000 Yuan; Control Should Prevent Panic. The vegetables and fruits in this city have always relied on transportation from Pudong, Xujiahui, Beixinjing, Fanwangdu, Huangdu, Hangzhou, and other places for supply. The day before yesterday, Pudong City suddenly posted a notice controlling Pudong vegetables, which is of great importance to the lives of citizens. Before the war, due to convenient transportation and smooth sources, there was no panic. After the war, due to traffic congestion, the prices of various vegetables have risen by 30% to 50% compared to before the war. Before the war, the total annual transaction volume in the 16th Puli was 20 million yuan, about 10 million yuan in Nanshi, and 400,000 to 500,000 yuan in Pudong. Pudong vegetables account for only one-tenth of the total supply to Shanghai, but Pudong's various vegetables arrive in Shanghai every day, and there are more than 4,000 vegetable vendors. Green vegetables are a necessity for Shanghai residents, and Pudong's transportation to Shanghai accounts for one-fifth. Usually, they mostly cross the river from Dongjiadu and Lannidu. Now that Hongkou has implemented control, although it has not yet caused a vegetable panic, prices will inevitably rise, which will affect the people's food supply. Furthermore, according to a reporter's record from Pudong, the notice is as follows: "Notice: This market has received orders from the Qiji Garrison and permission from the Pudong Detachment of the Naval Special Landing Force. All vegetables and other items produced in Pudong must be exported and directly transported to the Hongkou area for sale by Qichang Trading Company designated by this market. For all details, please inquire at the Pudong Temporary Office of this market at 334 Dajie, Qichang Trading Company. It will be implemented starting on August 16. All local households and vegetable vendors should pay attention. This notice." The Soviet Acting Consul General

Ordered to Return Home. Dalu Bao reported that Mr. Ximanski, the Soviet Acting Consul General in Shanghai, received an order to return home two months ago and is scheduled to depart for the Soviet Union tomorrow (the 15th) on the President Doumer.

### Handling Small Change Stamps, Requesting Instructions from the Head Office, Extremely Difficult to Handle Overly Soiled Stamps

Since the disappearance of copper coins from the city, small change has been difficult to use, and various circles have replaced them with stamps. For a time, one-cent, two-cent, and five-cent stamps of the postal service were in great demand. In the past two months, the number of these stamps circulating in the market has been as high as [blank], accounting for about 400,000 yuan. However, due to the length of time and daily use, most of them are soiled and unusable. Now, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Central Bank to print one-cent and five-cent auxiliary currency notes, attaching 300,000 yuan for one-cent notes and 200,000 yuan for five-cent notes, totaling 500,000 yuan. These fractional currency notes can be printed within days and will be issued by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank. Moreover, they are only applicable to Shanghai, and at that time, the 440,000 odd scattered stamps will inevitably cause serious problems. In particular, small businesses hold a larger number of these stamps. Since the news of the impending issuance of fractional currency notes spread, the use of stamps in the market has been stagnant. Therefore, a small number of merchants have requested relevant groups to forward letters to the Shanghai Postal Administration, suggesting a deadline for the recovery of all soiled stamps. According to the reporter from Xinsheng News Agency who inquired at the Shanghai Postal Administration, the administration is currently happy to accept the suggestions from various circles regarding these soiled stamps. However, due to postal regulations, it is still considering the issue, according to a senior official of the administration, or plans to request instructions from the Kunming Postal Headquarters of the Ministry of Communications for proper handling. However, those that are excessively soiled are particularly difficult to handle.

### Organized Anti-British Movement Has Spread to Shanghai; Japanese Soldiers Supervise Coolies Distributing Leaflets; White Russians Participate in Parades with Shamefaced Expressions

Dalu Bao reported that anti-British agitation spread to Shanghai yesterday (the 13th) morning, which is of great significance. Chinese coolies, under the supervision of Japanese soldiers, distributed leaflets to villagers in the Hongqiao area denouncing Britain and vehemently criticizing British policy, while urging action against the British in China. Regarding the latter, the leaflet stated four key points: (1) Chinese employed by British companies in the Shanghai area should resign within one week; (2) Chinese women married to British nationals should begin divorce proceedings; (3) Chinese should acquire all British church properties in Japanese-occupied areas within China; (4) Boycott British commercial organizations, including commercial firms and banks. According to eyewitnesses, the leaflets seemed to have little impact on the Chinese villagers, who are mostly illiterate. After receiving the leaflets, most of them abandoned them.

Airplane Leaflets Scattered by Wind. Yesterday afternoon, an airplane scattered leaflets opposing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in the Shanghai sky, but a gust of wind blew most of the leaflets to the suburbs, and only a few fell in the commercial district. There were two demonstrations with anti-Chiang and anti-British characteristics in Hongkou yesterday, but there was no violence. There were no bombings or other terrorist activities in the Public Concession and the French Concession, so the second anniversary of the Shanghai War can be said to have passed peacefully.

Demonstration Parades Clearly Have Backers. One of the two demonstration parades took place before noon. Approximately 7,000 Japanese, 4,000 Koreans, and 20,000 Chinese gathered in Hongkou Park to listen to speeches by the Japanese. Near noon, the demonstrators marched to the Japanese Consulate and sent representatives to present a "painting thanking the Japanese" to consulate officials. In the afternoon, around 2:00 PM, there was another demonstration parade, shouting anti-British and anti-Chiang slogans. It is estimated that about 3,000 people participated, including 1,500 Chinese and 300 White Russians. There was an armored car in the procession, with armed Japanese soldiers on the roof and sides. The demonstrators were in front of and behind the car, waving Japanese flags and five-colored flags, as well as German, Italian, and old Russian flags, proceeding along the roads of Hongkou. On both sides of the procession, Japanese and Chinese people in cars distributed anti-Chiang leaflets. It dispersed before evening. The Chinese and White Russians seemed very unhappy with the parade. Some White Russians turned their heads with shame when they saw that they were being noticed by foreigners.

White Russians Paid Five Corners to Participate. Also, the Zi Lin Daily reported that the Hongkou demonstration parade departed from North Sichuan Road at the corner of Paizilu just after 2:15 PM. Approximately 1,500 Japanese primary and secondary school students and 50 White Russians participated. It ended an hour later. It is reported that the White Russians each received 5 jiao of Huaxing currency for assisting in the parade. After the procession passed North Sichuan Road and North Suzhou Road, it stopped at the intersection of Broadway Road and North Suzhou Road. One person came out and spoke for some time, and then turned into Broadway Road and Xihua Road, singing patriotic songs, waving Japanese flags, and distributing leaflets along the way.

Puppets Presiding Over District Management. During the day, there was also new anti-British propaganda. The location for the previous day was in the city center, presided over by the puppet "Director" Peng Bin. Yesterday, there were also anti-British movements in Pudong Nanshi. In Pudong, Zhu Ding of the Damin Association presided over the event, summoning more than 100 "Dadong primary school students" to hold a meeting in the Huaiyang Theatre and parade with puppet flags. In Nanshi, Shen Shijing, the puppet district office director, also led a group of ignorant people to parade with flags.

Leaflets Found on Four People. Yesterday at noon, four Chinese people entered the concession by crossing the Yichang Road Bridge from the north side. At that time, British soldiers and Chinese and Western detectives stationed on the south side of the bridge searched them and found anti-British leaflets on each of the four people. They were detained and taken to the Putuo Road Police Station. It is reported that the four people claimed that they were approached and given the leaflets as they were about to enter the concession from the north side of the bridge. The four people carried them across the bridge out of fear of refusal, and were eventually caught. The police station, in order to facilitate investigation into the nature of their actions, specially transferred them to the political department of the General Inspectorate for investigation.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Police Force Annual Inspection

The Shanghai Municipal Council has scheduled the annual inspection of the police force to be held at 11:00 AM on Sunday, October 29. Mr. F.C.Pringle, the Chairman of the Council, will be the inspecting officer.

### Jewish Refugees No Longer Allowed to Come to Shanghai; Shanghai Municipal Council Believes Its Work Is Already Exhausted; It Is Time for Assistance from Other Places

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council recently decided to no longer allow European Jewish refugees to enter Shanghai, with the possible exception of refugees who have already boarded ships. The Municipal Council has sent letters to all consulates, shipping companies, and Mr. Hayim, (to be forwarded to the various Jewish organizations in Shanghai) informing them of the Council's decision. According to a spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council today (14th), the work done by Shanghai for European refugees has already been sufficient. Cheever does not believe that the Municipal Council lacks sympathy for the refugees, but Shanghai can no longer absorb refugees to prevent municipal affairs from reaching the point of being heavily burdened. If the unofficial news that the Japanese authorities will no longer allow immigrants to settle on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek is true, then the north bank of the Suzhou Creek will certainly have no room for them. The Municipal Council has not provided a large amount of economic assistance to the refugees. The local Jewish organizations have done a good job in assisting immigrants. The Municipal Council has assisted by providing vacant houses and land for use. However, the sudden arrival of a large number of refugees has given the already busy police force extra work, and unlimited refugee arrivals will add burdens to all municipal affairs. A large increase in medical services is just one example. Shanghai has done more than its share, and it is time for others to provide assistance. The Municipal Council understands that refugees may think that everything in Shanghai will be better than the situation in the places they left, but coming to a city that is not well prepared for them is also detrimental to the refugees themselves. Refugees who have already boarded ships will not be forced to leave, as they should be allowed to enter the country for humanitarian reasons. It is reported that a total of 15,000 Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria have arrived in Shanghai. According to the Municipal Council's prediction before making this decision, another 5,000 people will arrive this year. It is estimated that 500 people have already set out for Shanghai this morning. These people will be the last batch of refugees to be allowed to enter the Public Concession.

### Japanese Izumo Warship Leaves Shanghai; Rumored to Be Heading to Qingdao for Patrol; But This Claim Has Not Been Confirmed

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Izumo, the flagship of the Japanese Third Fleet stationed in Chinese waters, which has been docked at the old post pier on Huangpu Road for nearly a year, sailed out of Shanghai at 10:00 AM this morning (the 14th). It is rumored that the ship is sailing to Qingdao for a routine patrol and will return to Shanghai at the beginning of next month. However, this claim has not been verified. When the Izumo returns to Shanghai, it may inspect the Japanese warships stationed at the Yangtze River estuary and at the various ports on the Yangtze River near Shanghai.

### Buddhist Holy Land Putuoshan; Japanese Soldiers Withdraw Completely; Situation on the Mountain Is Relatively Quiet; Temple Fairs Are Desolate, No One Is Visiting for Summer Retreat

Putuoshan, which belongs to Dinghai County, is a Buddhist holy land. Since the start of the war, the area has been coveted by the Japanese, who have repeatedly tried to land. Since the fall of Dinghai, the area was also forcibly landed by the Japanese army under the cover of Japanese warships on the 2nd of last month. More than 70 Japanese soldiers were stationed at the Puji Temple and the Baoben Hall. Now, a month later, at the beginning of last week, the Japanese soldiers all returned to their ships by motorboat. The situation on the mountain is now relatively peaceful. However, the temple fairs are desolate, and no one is visiting for summer retreat. The monks on the mountain, who rely on the income from the temple fairs for a year's worth of food and clothing, have no income at all and all look malnourished. The temples that have branch temples in Shanghai, that is, branch temples, are now actively moving to Shanghai to make up for the losses. The Putuo temple fairs are the best in the country. In its heyday, the monks on the mountain were all well-fed and well-dressed, living a comfortable life. They have never encountered this year's situation, which can be said to be a misfortune for the Buddhist community on the mountain.

### National Goods Factory United Association Plans to Set Up a Kunming Branch; Transportation Circles Have Been Invited to Transfer There; Plans to Develop Transportation in Western China

Various national goods manufacturers in this city, in view of the central government's recent efforts to build important cities and towns in the southwest, are sparing no effort to assist the government, promote national products, and connect the interior. They have specially dispatched cadres to Kunming, Chengdu, Xikang, Guilin, and other places to conduct on-the-spot inspections and actively prepare to set up branch factories in those places, increase production, and promote the adoption of national goods by the people. According to the reporter from Daguang News Agency who inquired in the national goods circles yesterday, the National Goods Factory United Association of this city, considering that its members have invested a large amount of capital in the southwestern provinces, in order to facilitate the transfer of orders from the central government and encourage the development of national products, has prepared to set up a Kunming branch. Once the assembly is complete, members will be convened to discuss association affairs. It is also learned that famous figures in the transportation circles of this city have been invited by the central government to go to Haiphong and transfer to Kunming. It is said that they will plan to develop the transportation business in Western China.

### Battle of Jinhui Bridge, Japanese Army Suffered Considerable Casualties

The day before yesterday, during the day, a team of more than 100 Japanese soldiers from Punan entered through the Zhagang port and invaded the Jinhui Bridge Town on the Fengnan border. They engaged in a fierce battle with the troops of Pei Zilin under Ding Xishan's command there. Before the Japanese army invaded, Pei's troops had received intelligence early on, so they arranged a clever line of defense, moving the main force to both sides and leaving a small number of troops to guard the town. The Japanese army concentrated their guns and cannons and bombarded the town. Just as they were feeling triumphant, the machine guns of the guerrillas on both sides swept in densely, so the Japanese suffered considerable casualties. When they rushed to the town, they realized it was an empty formation. Now, the Japanese army that arrived at Jinhui Bridge Town is surrounded by guerrillas on all sides, trapped in a dilemma of advancing or retreating.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Concerts; Special Programs for Two Performances

The seat prices have increased slightly. Reservations can be made starting at 10:00 AM from the French Association (for the performance at the French Park) and the Shanghai Municipal Council Revenue Office (for the performance at the Zhaofeng Park).

### Tzu Lien Refugee Shelter Changes Food Distribution Method

The Tzu Lien Relief Association of this city, due to the recent shortage of rice and difficulty in procurement, has made changes to the food distribution of its affiliated shelters in order to make adjustments. The details of the method are as follows: (1) Rice (mixed with oatmeal) will continue to be provided for lunch. Dinner will be changed to steamed buns, each weighing two liang. Regardless of the size of the refugee, each person will receive four buns. (2) Shelters that cook for themselves will have their food supplies changed to flour, with each bag intended to feed 120 people. It will be distributed according to the number of people, and they can make steamed buns or cut noodles as they please. It is reported that the above two methods will be implemented starting from the 15th of this month.

### Skirmish Near Route Cardinal Mercier, Farmer's Daughter Wounded by Gunfire, Seeks Treatment at Sanatorium

According to the English-language "China Press," a 19-year-old Chinese farmer's daughter with multiple gunshot wounds was carried into the Shanghai Sanatorium this morning (the 14th) for treatment. It is reported that she was wounded last night (the 13th) during a skirmish between Japanese troops and guerrillas near Route Cardinal Mercier.

### Rising Prices: Another Corner of Shanghai

— Wen Qin

A Stroll Through the Vegetable Market and Snack Stalls

In search of something new to try, I took a vegetable basket and a small umbrella on a midsummer morning, and without any attendants, went alone to the Route Père Robert vegetable market nearby to buy vegetables, taking the opportunity to stroll through the snack stalls next to it. In these times of expensive goods, of course, these snack items have also been drawn into the whirlpool of price increases. Extracting some fragments from the stallholders' complaints can be considered a report from another corner of society.

Because it was still early, the pedestrians on Route Père Robert were still sparse. A few ayis and older sisters, carts full of vegetables, and delivery bicycles temporarily punctuated the quiet street. At the intersection of Route Père Robert, Route Maybert and Route des Soeurs stood a sign, "Single-wheeled vehicles, this road is only allowed from south to north, not from north to south." This sign is located on the northwest corner of the vegetable market, ten or so storefronts south and twenty or so storefronts east. The area is the multiplication of length and width, which is the area of this small vegetable market. This vegetable market is not as grand as the Eight Immortals Bridge vegetable market, nor is the market as prosperous as the Chenjiabang vegetable market, but it is also small and exquisite, and it is still a first-class vegetable market. If you find other vegetable markets too noisy, you may as well come here to shop, and you are sure to have a satisfactory harvest!

On the northern edge of this vegetable market are rows of various snack stalls, hot and cold, meat and vegetarian, dry and wet, everything is available, a spectacular sight. Among them, the most are the big pancake stalls, accounting for at least thirty to forty percent. Because I knew that big pancakes had recently risen to two cents each, I wanted to learn more about the situation from the practitioners, so I approached a pancake stall. First, I bought two big pancakes, which were indeed much bigger than before. Next to them was a round cake that was two cents longer in diameter than the flaky pastry, costing one cent each. At that time, an old woman was cooking a pancake, so I asked her with a respectful and sincere attitude, "Grandma, what is this pancake called?" Then her talkativeness was opened, she said that this is an oil pancake, one dime each, formerly five cents each; next to it, a thick and hard one is called "qiang" (I don't know which character), and it sells for five dimes each, which is cut open and sold separately; fried dough sticks are two cents each. She said that the fried dough sticks are much longer than before, and also talked about the expensiveness of flour, which used to be three yuan a bag, but now it costs more than six yuan a bag; sesame seeds are one yuan for two catties, which used to be able to buy four or five catties; coal dross costs more than four yuan a load, which used to be only two yuan. At this time, her oil pancake was already cooked, and when she lifted the flat pan, I found that she was burning coal briquettes underneath. She further stated that this furnace body is shallow and not suitable for burning coal dross. She also said sadly: "Alas, coal briquettes are also expensive now, three yuan and three cents a load!" She looked at me sincerely, and I nodded sympathetically.

To the right of her, a close neighbor is a porridge stall. Bowls of hot white porridge, as well as mung bean porridge, are squatting on the board table. Several coolies are sitting next to the table, sipping porridge. The porridge dishes include yellow beans, peanuts, fermented bean curd, and preserved eggs. Except for the first three, which are favored by customers, no one cares about the preserved eggs. A large bowl of porridge costs four cents, a small dish of beans two cents, and a small piece of fermented bean curd one cent. It only costs six cents to buy a full meal, which is very affordable. Just as I was about to turn around and leave, I saw a bright red paper in a glass frame on the table. I saw a few lines of small characters written on it, and I still remember, "Dear customers, please forgive me, six cents is rounded down, seven cents is rounded up, this owner is honest." I really feel straightforward and cute, but I don't quite understand its true meaning, it is probably about stamps and hair tickets. (To be continued)

Ma Caizhen, a woman from Pinghu, previously retained lawyer Yan Zhaolin to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Court, accusing her master, Lu Qinsheng, a wealthy merchant from the same hometown, his wife Lu Xing, their son-in-law Zhu Zizhao and his wife Zhu Lu, and Doctor Yang Zhongfu, etc., of seduction,

Inciting Abortion,

Aiding and Abetting Abortion, etc. During the trial, Lu suddenly incited a maid, Xu Shen, to testify, falsely claiming to be Ma Caizhen's maternal aunt, and also incited Li Zhou to impersonate Ma's biological mother, proving that Ma was only 19 years old and had no capacity to sue, intending to overturn the previous case, and filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division to confirm that Ma Caizhen was his biological daughter, but the plaintiff's lawsuit was rejected. Therefore, Ma again

Filed a Supplementary Complaint

Accusing Lu Qinsheng, Li Zhou, Xu Shen, etc. of inciting perjury, etc. The defendants also retained lawyers Xu Wufang and Sun Zuji to defend them. The first instance of the case was concluded by Judge Miao Qingbang, who sentenced Lu Xing to six months' imprisonment. Lu Qinsheng avoided appearing in court and was wanted. The rest of the parts were found not guilty. Since the judgment, both parties

Were Dissatisfied

And have appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After the High Court received the complaint, Chief Judge Wu Tingqi, accompanied by judges Gu and Wu, held a collegial panel to summon them yesterday. Ma did not attend due to illness. Her representative lawyer said that the appellant Ma Caizhen's health had been affected by the abortion, and she was bedridden and unable to speak.

### Hurricane Lands in Fuzhou, Trend Dissipates, Only One Level of Wind Force Remains, Not Felt to Be Fierce

The newly formed hurricane in the Pacific Ocean landed yesterday morning and reached the west of Fuzhou in the afternoon, showing a trend of dissipation. According to the Xujiahui Observatory's report at 6:00 a.m. yesterday, the hurricane had reached 25.5 degrees north latitude and 119.5 degrees east longitude, heading west-northwest, with the center within 30 nautical miles. It was the time when the hurricane began to land in Fuzhou.

Shanghai Also Affected

When the hurricane landed, the wind force felt in Fuzhou was not fierce, only about four levels. At that time, the climate in Shanghai suddenly became gloomy, and around 9:00 a.m., there were showers, which were affected by the hurricane landing in Fuzhou and the wind dispersing. Compared to the Observatory's report at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, the hurricane had reached the west of Fuzhou, at 26 degrees north latitude and 119 degrees east longitude, with the center within 60 nautical miles, and the direction was still northwest.

Another Hurricane Moving

The development of the hurricane after landing clearly tends towards dispersal. Because the remaining wind force in Fuzhou yesterday afternoon was only one level. Therefore, it is speculated that it will soon disappear. However, a new hurricane near Guam Island in the Pacific Ocean is also moving west-northwest, far from Shanghai. Therefore, its trend and wind force are still unknown. Also, the highest temperature in Shanghai yesterday was 91.8 degrees, and the lowest was 75 degrees.

### Open-Air Concert Season Coming to an End

### Wen Bao Cherish Writing Bureau Staff In Litigation Due to a Grudge, A Letter Results in a Big Fight, Both Parties Appeal After Unsatisfactory First Instance

The Wen Bao Cherish Writing Bureau on Route Lagrene in the French Concession is a charitable organization in Shanghai. Its work is to collect discarded paper with writing from various places, gather and incinerate it, to prevent it from drifting all over the ground, being trampled in the mud. The purpose is purely to respect writing, which was regarded by ancient people as a work that prolongs life, eliminates disasters, and brings blessings. Therefore, gentlemen and gentry are willing to donate money to promote it, set up a bureau to hire people

To collect written paper, regarded as accumulating virtue, and included in charitable undertakings, including vegetarianism, chanting scriptures, etc. Up to now, the bureau has purchased its own property to maintain itself, so as not to rely on donations. Although the work has now stopped, there are still some employees retained. Wei Xuanyao and Fang Yunzhi, the two, usually disagree with Wei's handling of bureau affairs and often directly advise him, which causes

Conflicts. Recently, Teng Yunshan, a colleague from Hong Kong, sent a letter to several of them, talking about bureau affairs. Wei refused to allow Fang to read the letter, but Fang believed that he was also one of the recipients and had the right to read it, so a dispute arose. Wei immediately gathered his nephew Weinan and maid Huang to beat Fang severely with wooden stool legs, to vent his accumulated hatred, causing Fang to be injured all over his body. He immediately filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court

Requesting an examination of the injuries, and later filed a private prosecution against Wei Xuanyao and others for assault in the Criminal Division of the original court. Wei also filed a counterclaim for assault and defamation. As a result of the first instance, Wei was fined and compensated for medical expenses, and Fang was found not guilty. Therefore, Wei was dissatisfied with the judgment and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court.

Fang entrusted lawyers Zhu Xueyu and Qiu Jiexiu to appear in court to defend him. The case has now been concluded by the collegial panel of the High Court. The judgment was rendered yesterday, rejecting Wei Xuanyao's appeal, granting a two-year suspended sentence, and rejecting both parties' claims in the attached civil suit.

Educational News

### Number of Graduates from Higher Education Institutions Nationwide Over the Years Totals More Than 95,800, Two People Out of 10,000 Receive Higher Education

(Special dispatch from Chongqing) The Ministry of Education recently compiled detailed statistics on the number and majors of graduates from colleges and universities nationwide over the years. Extracts are provided below. The number of graduates from colleges and universities in previous years has increased or decreased along with the number of students enrolled in the academic year. The number of graduates from colleges and universities before the founding of the Republic of China reached 3,184. The number of graduates in the first year of the Republic of China was 490, which increased to 1,155 in the sixth year, and then decreased to 900 in the seventh year. The reason is that the number of students enrolled in the first, second, and third years was relatively large, so the number of graduates in the fourth and fifth years was also relatively large. After the fourth year, the number of students enrolled decreased, so after the sixth year, the number of graduates also decreased slightly. From the eighth year to the thirteenth year, it increased from 1,137 to 3,397. In the fourteenth year, it decreased to 2,272. In the fifteenth year, it increased to 2,841. In the sixteenth year, it decreased again to 2,714. In the seventeenth year, it decreased to 2,253. From the eighteenth year, it increased again from 4,164 year by year. By the twenty-third year, it increased to 9,622. The reason is that after the seventeenth year, the number of students increased year by year, so when they graduated, the number of graduates also increased accordingly. The number of university graduates in the twentieth year was 6,392, an increase of 2,453 compared to 3,939 in the nineteenth year. The reason is that after the sixteenth year, the number of universities increased year by year, and some graduates from specialized schools transferred to universities to continue their studies. Therefore, from the twentieth year to the twenty-third year, the number of university graduates increased annually. The number of students in colleges and universities nationwide in the twentieth year was the highest in previous years, so the number of graduates in the twenty-third year also increased sharply, making it one of the years with the most graduates since the founding of the Republic of China. From the twenty-first year, the Ministry of Education promoted practical sciences and restricted the establishment of liberal arts schools. In the twenty-second year, it restricted the enrollment of liberal arts students, and the number of students enrolled decreased year by year. Therefore, the number of graduates in the twenty-fourth year also decreased to 8,672, a decrease of 905 compared to the twenty-third year. The number of graduates in the twenty-fifth year was 8,601, a decrease of 1,021 compared to the twenty-third year. However, although the number of graduates in liberal arts, commerce, and other subjects has shown a trend of decreasing year by year, the number of graduates in science, agriculture, engineering, medicine, and other subjects has increased year by year.

In the twenty-sixth year, during the War of Resistance against Japan, the number of graduates from colleges and universities nationwide totaled 5,329, a decrease of 4,293 compared to the 9,622 in the twenty-third year, and a decrease of 3,272 compared to the 8,601 in the twenty-fifth year. The reason for the sharp decrease in the number of graduates in the twenty-sixth year was obviously due to the impact of the war. Some students moved from the war zone to the interior, or temporarily suspended their studies due to economic difficulties, or delayed their enrollment period due to relocation, or some schools were suspended and students dispersed. If we refer to the number of students enrolled in each school in the twenty-sixth year, then the decrease in the number of graduates in the twenty-sixth year is inevitable. In total, from the establishment of colleges and universities in the late Qing Dynasty to the end of the twenty-sixth year, over more than 30 years, there are statistical figures for graduates in our country who have received higher education, totaling 95,813. If the national population is calculated at 474 million, as announced by the Ministry of Interior in the 17th year of the Republic of China, then there are only two college graduates out of 10,000 people.

### Education Expert Wan Minhao Discusses Preparations Before the Exam (Part 1) - The Choice of Department Should Be Decided Early, and Revision Should Begin Once Chosen

(Chongqing News) Education expert Wan Minhao discussed preparations before the exam. The content is quite concise. The details are as follows:

Choosing a Department

The choice of department should be decided early by students seeking higher education. Currently, there are fourteen types of colleges in schools above the vocational level, eighty-eight departments, and another forty-five vocational and specialized courses. Young people naturally feel overwhelmed when they first see such complex departments, hesitating and unable to decide for a long time. In fact, all departments can be studied, but one should choose the one that best suits their individual needs. The selection criteria can be determined based on the needs of the country and individual personality and ability. Young people should take revitalizing the country and nation as their responsibility, and academic research should also prioritize the needs of the country, so that they can contribute what they have learned to the country. The job prospects for talent urgently needed by the country are bound to be better. Therefore, even for personal prospects, this should be the primary selection criterion. The country needs a wide range of talents, but due to the demands of the times, there must be an emphasis on certain areas. In recent years, the educational authorities have been gradually adjusting departments and faculties with this intention. Young people should silently observe the trends and make their choices. Since the late Qing Dynasty, when China began to develop schools, it has emphasized practical subjects. The Program for Resistance and National Reconstruction allows for attention to scientific education. It is undoubtedly necessary for young people to devote themselves to scientific research. To illustrate this further, in today's three-dimensional warfare, a country cannot stand without an air force. China has a vast territory and will need to build a strong air force in the future. While pilots are needed, manufacturing is even more urgent. Therefore, in recent years, universities have added aviation departments. Ambitious young people should not ignore the purpose of these new departments. There are many other equally important departments, so there is no need to list them all. Choosing a department based on the talents needed by the country is still too broad, so personal personality and interests should also be used as a standard. For example, those with clear minds and deep aptitude are suitable for exploring natural sciences, while those with flexible thinking and keen eyes are conducive to the study of social sciences. Those with similar temperaments naturally feel interested, and if they do not feel interested, then it is definitely not suitable for their personality. It is up to individuals to carefully reflect, and it is difficult to prescribe a constant standard to explain this. In senior high school, there is already a distinction between arts and sciences. When a certain subject was chosen at that time, it had already undergone careful consideration. Schools above the vocational level are simply more detailed in their divisions. If applicants can refer to past subject selection criteria and recent learning interests to make a more precise selection, then they will succeed. If a certain subject is considered, the country urgently needs this talent, the individual is also interested in it, but if they assess their ability, it seems to be insufficient, this should never be forced. To study advanced academics, one must first have basic academic ability. Those who guide things according to circumstances are more likely to succeed. Learning often involves conducting deeper research based on one's strengths, so that one can achieve twice the result with half the effort and achieve greater success. Otherwise, one will waste time and energy, which the wise will never do. For example, if one has studied humanities and has not paid much attention to mathematics and science courses, then one should still pursue further studies in humanities. The country does not not need this type of talent, and they will be able to use what they have learned in the future. Do not be tempted by new opportunities and change to studying science and engineering. Not only will there be many difficulties in future studies, but there will also be less hope of being admitted to the entrance exam. In short, applicants can choose several departments that best suit them based on the above criteria, and then fill them in on the application form when registering. For example, the unified enrollment in the 27th year stipulates that students taking the exam, in addition to identifying one department of one school as their first choice, can also select other departments of the same school or departments of other schools as their second, third, or fourth choices, but they should be limited to those with the same set of written exam subjects or those with similar properties.

### Financial Turmoil in Europe Again - Situation Chaotic - Fluctuations Gradually Expanding

Yesterday's spot gold market, although the foreign exchange fluctuations were not as large as last week, the gold market was still quite volatile. The panic has not yet subsided. The process generally involved a sharp rise first, followed by a sharp fall, and then a rebound. The high and low range on that day was also 280 yuan. At first, the situation was very stable. The morning opening was 4,400 yuan. Shortly after the opening, the news of tight foreign exchange stimulated buying. A certain bank absorbed orders on behalf of outsiders, and the price soared to a high of 4,540 yuan. Afterwards, there were rumors that the Exchange Equalization Account would once again maintain the four-pence British gold standard, foreign exchange suddenly relaxed sharply, the market was inherently weak, and general buyers such as securities firms shifted their targets and rushed to sell. The noon close retreated to 4,410 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors spread in the market that the German fleet was moving on the French border, and there were also rumors that the Japanese army representative suddenly left Tokyo to return to office, fearing that the Anglo-Japanese conference would break down. At that time, foreign exchange was firm, causing a certain gold firm to sell on behalf of speculators, and the selling pressure intensified, once retreating to a low of 4,260 yuan. After entering, the foreign exchange turned stable, the selling pressure stopped immediately, securities firms and others turned to buying, and rebounded to 4,385 yuan, but the result closed at 4,345 yuan, 25 yuan higher than the noon close on Saturday, but 50 yuan lower than the off-exchange price on the previous day.

at a price of 4,400 yuan, 80 yuan higher

than the noon close on Saturday, but not much

higher or lower than the off-exchange price

on the previous day. After the opening, foreign

exchange became tight, causing a sudden surge

commissioned by foreign banks and wealthy

individuals to compete to buy, and the

market became firm and continued to

rise. Soon, it soared by 140 yuan. A certain

money exchange company entered 30 taels from

a peer, at 4,540 yuan, which was the high point

of the day. At that time, jewelry

firms took the opportunity to sell high, once

company came to absorb more than 100 taels,

and the potential became strong again, and it

soared another 40 yuan. A certain money

exchange company entered 50 taels from a jewelry

firm, at a price of 4,520 yuan. After that, there

was a sudden reversal and a sharp fall, because

foreign exchange stopped being tight and turned

loose, and the selling pressure suddenly intensified.

Securities firms and retail investors rushed to

sell, and soon it plummeted by 130 yuan. Jewelry

firms did 20 taels back and forth, at a price of

4,390 yuan. Near noon,

a certain money exchange company entered 20 taels from a securities firm,

at 4,410 yuan, as the noon closing price. Later,

taels from money exchange companies, at a price of 4,350 yuan, and then

yuan. The spot gold price of cash firms

yuan, 15 yuan lower than the price on Saturday.

Buyers of foreign exchange temporarily wait and see - Exchange rate continues to ease, US dollar once reached 7 yuan

Yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's posted prices were announced, both without ups and downs. The dark market of British and American exchanges, due to different opinions in the Japanese cabinet, and although the central bank has made concessions to Japan, it is firm on the silver case because the United States and France are involved and it is unwilling to discuss it alone. Furthermore, the situation in Europe is becoming increasingly tense. As for the Stability Plan of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee for black market foreign exchange, rumors are still rampant, and it is said that it will once again maintain the four-pence standard. People's hearts have calmed down because of this, and buyers are also waiting and see. The process throughout the day, at the beginning, the potential was extremely stable. After nine o'clock, due to frequent settlement of accounts in the foreign firm sector, it once tended to soften, the tightest British gold was three pence four thousand sixty two five, and the softest US dollar was six yuan six two five, and it was difficult to settle at that time. However, the Chinese and Western speculators selling in front and the Hong Kong telegrams selling afterwards gradually turned the situation stable. In the afternoon, British gold had shouted three pence five thousand nine hundred thirty-seven five, and US dollars had also called seven yuan. After entering, because the Japanese bank recovered a little, the situation turned stable. As a result, the closing price was three pence five thousand three hundred twelve five for British gold and six yuan eight hundred seventy-five for US dollars. Futures for this month also increased accordingly, British increased zero six two five and US loosened one two five, trading was still strong.

### Sassoon and Hong Kong Sells in Succession

In the early morning, the London big ticket,

the recent increase zero six two five,

and the forward increase one two

five, the New York silver price and the foreign exchange rates of the United States,

were all closed for business. London raw gold was fixed, and the exchange rate of

British to US and to France were flat, and to Shanghai, it was big one

eight seven five. The central bank's posted exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling prices of banks

for spot goods were three pence four thousand six hundred eighty-seven five for British gold and six yuan seven five for US dollars, compared

to the end of last week, there were no changes, after the opening, although banks such as Yinhang Youli and Hua Yinhang came to buy,

because outside banks such as a certain bank still had good intentions, so

the situation was very stable. It is estimated that Yinhang Youli bought spot British gold three pence four thousand six hundred eighty-seven five from a peer, then

Hua Yinhang bought spot US dollars from a certain bank for six yuan seven

five. When HSBC's posted price was announced, there were no changes, and the silver balance tax announcement was still exempt. After that, because the foreign firm sector of major foreign firms frequently settled accounts, and the intention of outside firms was very weak, the potential

gradually became tight. It is estimated that a certain foreign bank such as Huabi sold spot British gold three pence four thousand and sixty-two five to outside firms, and spot US dollars six yuan six two five, at the same time. Merchants buying a certain bank in the foreign spot US dollars six yuan six

five, plus this month's US dollars six yuan four

hundred thirty-seven five, would once be difficult to buy at the above price.

However, because Western businessman Sassoon sold in front, and the Hong Kong telegraph sold afterwards, the situation gradually turned

stable. It is estimated that Sassoon sold spot British gold to outside firms three pence four thousand six hundred eighty-seven five and a half pence, and spot US dollars six yuan seven five. Later, the Hong Kong telegram sold

spot British gold to favorable foreign banks such as three pence half and five thousand three hundred twelve five, and spot US dollars six yuan seven five and eight hundred twelve five.

It was noon at that time. Until the noon close, the selling price of banks for spot goods, British gold three pence five thousand three hundred twelve five, US dollars six yuan eight hundred seventy-five, compared to the opening in the morning, British increased zero six two five, US hardened one two five.

### Japanese Merchants Still Buy in the Afternoon

In the afternoon, because the Hong Kong telegrams continued to sell, and speculators also slightly sold, the market

became firm. It is estimated that the Hong Kong telegrams and speculators sold spot British gold

three pence five thousand six hundred twenty-five and spot US dollars six yuan nine hundred thirty-seven five to favorable foreign banks and others. Later, the buying price of banks had asked for British gold three pence five thousand nine hundred thirty-seven five, US dollars seven yuan. After entering, because the Japanese bank scraped together, the situation became stable. It is estimated that the Japanese bank absorbed spot British gold from outside firms three pence five thousand six hundred twenty-five and five thousand three hundred five, and bought spot US dollars six yuan nine hundred thirty-seven five from Datong. Until the evening close, the selling price of banks for spot goods, British gold three pence five thousand three hundred twelve five, US dollars six yuan eight hundred seventy-five, this month's British gold three pence four thousand five hundred thirty-one five, US dollars six yuan seven hundred eighteen seven five, the result is that the current period British are increased zero six two five and US dollars are hardened one two five.

### Hong Kong China Exchange Rate Declines by Ten Yuan

The spot exchange rate of U.S. currency remained unchanged, but the forward exchange rate has not yet been issued. The Shen exchange rate rose by three yuan, to four hundred and fifteen yuan.

Against the US currency, it increased by one two five, at five yuan and a half. The black market for China Exchange and "United Currency" remained unchanged, at 126 yuan and 100 yuan respectively.

### Securities: Internal Debt Hovering

Securities

The after-hours market for securities yesterday was again unpredictable. After an initial agreement, the price dropped again by a small yuan, fluctuating continuously.

The price hovered within a range of one or two yuan. Both bullish and bearish factions were watching and operating within this narrow scope. Therefore, there may not be significant ups and downs in the market for the time being. The Central Bank's relaxation is gradual, gold is gradually weakening, and government bonds have also failed to rally. After the close, it was rumored that British-Japanese

negotiations had broken down, and there were also rumors of new loans being a possibility. Hence, the after-hours market rose by six or seven jiao.

News changes rapidly, leaving speculators bewildered. Therefore, the trend is likely to be one of fluctuation.

Yesterday's market opening was seven or eight jiao better than the previous day. The United and and retail investors bought in, but then Nos. 42 and Tian Sheng sold at high prices.

The market weakened immediately. Although Zhen Kang Maochun and retail investors bought in, Zhong Yi Daqing and the United and sold again, and the price still could not be sustained, dropping suddenly by one yuan.

The closing price was still two or three jiao to six jiao lower than the previous day. However, sentiment improved after the close, and the price rebounded by five, six, or seven jiao. The total turnover was estimated at around four to five hundred thousand yuan. A simplified table is provided below.

Stocks

Stock trading: 200 shares of the yarn and cloth exchange were traded at a price of 36.5 yuan.

The Public Industry Exchange opened for settlement yesterday morning and opened for trading in the afternoon. Trading time was extremely short, and the market appeared slightly weak. Transaction prices were particularly low,

partly because the Japanese army representative left Tokyo, British-Japanese parliamentary negotiations broke down, and the exchange rate trend relaxed slightly.

### Yarn and Cloth: Yarn Market Tranquil; Transactions Based on Actual Needs; Meeting Arrangements Under Discussion

Cotton

The spot market for cotton yarn is calm. With the extension of foreign exchange, people's minds are more settled and the market has become tranquil. As for the guild, although it has announced its closure,

merchants still inquire about prices via direct telephone calls before deciding on purchases. Other brokers run around contacting merchants, so there are still transactions. Therefore, all transactions are practical. The futures market has shrunk sharply. Merchants from South China and Hong Kong

continue to have unwavering demand, while purchases from other regions are rare.

Currently,

yarn traders gather in groups of three or five in the corridors of yarn shops in the morning, discussing market prices. According to brokers, merchants from Guangdong have some

interest, but their bids are very low. The asking price for 20-count Double Horse yarn is 700 yuan, but there has been a long standoff, and the holders of the goods are unwilling to sell. Subsequently, the price rebounded. It is estimated that merchants from Guangdong and Hong Kong bought about four

to five hundred bales. Eighty bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Haiphong on the 15th. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 3 yuan, and the price of Double Globe yarn fell by 5 yuan.

Afternoon

news: Concrete measures for the buying and selling of cotton yarn are currently under

negotiation separately, and it may not be easy to formally establish them for some time.

The

current situation of yarn is still good. Merchants from Guangdong are still buying 20-count Double Horse yarn at a price of 725 yuan, which is

3 yuan higher than the morning price. However, after 3 pm, the market weakened due to the lengthening of foreign exchange rates and the decline in gold prices. According to a certain

runner, Zhuang Ke received a telegram from Beihai, saying to stop loading and purchasing, the reason being that the situation there is not

peaceful.

### Current Production Status

Since the outbreak of the full-scale Sino-Japanese War,

Shanghai's cotton yarn market, as an isolated island, has been developing abnormally. This has led to manipulation and monopoly by hoarders and speculators, coupled with the sharp contraction of the black market for foreign exchange. The price of yarn (20-count yarn)

has soared from more than 400 yuan to 500 yuan, 600 yuan, and eventually to a staggering peak of 740 yuan for spot goods. This is an unprecedented record in the decades since the establishment of the yarn mill

business. As for actual sales, most of the Chinese yarn sold in the market

(yarn sales area) is no longer ours, but confined to the southwest corner, which is pitifully

narrow and meager compared to before the war. The current reason for the high price of yarn is artificial speculation and the turmoil created by the foreign exchange black market.

(Some mistakenly believe that this is due to the volatility of the Chinese currency system, but this is actually not the case.)

The actual sales of Chinese yarn, such as in Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, Kunming, and Chongqing, are only several

hundred bales per day, and at most, only occasionally over a thousand

bales. The cotton yarn speculative market in the isolated island has been suspended by an order from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, but

profiteers are still active in secret, although with some restraint. From now on, legitimate yarn merchants must

focus on actual spot trading. The current amount of spot yarn hoarded in foreign warehouses (including those held by yarn shops, hoarders, financial institutions, etc.) is no less than 100,000

bales. What is the current state of production of various Chinese-owned yarn mills in the special zone? This is what everyone is eager to

know. Our inquiry is as follows (in terms of 20-count yarn production):

According to the above statistics, the daily

(day and night) actual spindles operated by Chinese-owned yarn mills total around 370,000. The daily and nightly production of 20-count

yarn reaches 265,500 pounds, which, calculated at 420 pounds per bale, amounts to around 632 bales. The monthly output is about 19,000

bales. This is just enough to meet actual sales. With the existing inventory of about 100,000 bales in foreign warehouses, it will inevitably lead to a situation of consumption without replenishment. The inevitable result is a drastic drop in yarn prices of one to two hundred yuan

in the near future. Why would wealthy hoarders insist on making such a move that harms themselves, others, and consumers? (Long)

### Cotton Prices Too High: Transactions Not Very Smooth

Transactions of Chinese and foreign cotton can still be maintained,

but sales have slowed down because yarn prices have fallen and,

secondly, because the lengthening of foreign exchange rates has led to a stable mentality.

The market is very tranquil. China Factory and Defeng Factory

imported 500 bales of Zhangde cotton by post, priced at 162 yuan (cash). British Factory Ewo

also imported several hundred pieces of Indian cotton. Mutual buying and selling among colleagues is not as much as in the past. Attitudes have become

more peaceful, and market prices have also weakened slightly. 226 bales of Jitong cotton from northern Jiangsu have arrived, and

another 40 bales from Tianjin. The current cotton sales situation is recorded on the left.

Another message, the foreign cotton transaction in Shanghai yesterday, due to the exchange rate lengthening, the conversion of legal tender cotton

prices have fallen. However, the intention of industry colleagues is quite high, temporarily

unwilling to sell. However, factories also think cotton

prices are still high, so the purchase intention is particularly loose. However,

given the current situation, Shanghai's inventory is relatively thin, and the exchange

rate will not lengthen too much, so the raw cotton sale

price will not plummet. But in the future, when yarn mills

reduce working hours and factory orders flood in, the selling price will be worrying.

Foreign cotton market prices, New York cotton market, has not improved much recently, yesterday,

due to various parties selling and bull positions settling, the market is exhausted.

Coupled with the weakness of Wall Street, the market price has not been able to rise. The result is a drop of six, six, seven pounds.

The Indian market is quite firm, including a prediction of a one and a half rupee increase. The Egyptian cotton market is stable.

### Piece Goods: Market Prices Insufficient to Cover Costs; Factories Refuse to Open Futures; The Trend of Hoarding Also Subdued

Domestic Cloth: The trend of speculation and hoarding in the cloth market has subsided slightly, but the market price is

difficult for factories to cover costs, refusing

to open futures. Therefore, sales prices of inventory from colleagues and factories continue to rise. Qian Ni and colored cloth each increase by three

to five jiao per piece, white cloth is flat. Only Ewo's 16-pound

Double Elephant coarse cloth is purchased by Shandong gangs in 40 to 50

bales, and the sales price increases by two and a half jiao. Other heavy and light pound

coarse cloths also increase by one jiao to two and a half jiao per piece. Guangdong gangs handle Hongzhang, Daxin, Huafeng and other factory

products such as thread velvet and colored twill in more than 600 cases.

Overseas Siamese and Singapore gangs handle bleached and dyed twill and fine cloth in 4,000

several hundred pieces. Wholesale shops on this street import fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, bleached and dyed cloth in two

hundred several pieces. The demand in Sichuan and Yunnan is very weak. The Tianjin gang in the north road, with the Tianjin case negotiating stalled, and there is also a flood,

no intention to purchase various goods, only to settle orders

procedures.

Eastern Piece Goods: White fine cloth and fine twill

yesterday, due to ordinary actual sales, the sales price

has fallen back, compared to last week each piece

falling one jiao to two jiao and a half, 12-pound Dragon

Head fine cloth spot price is 18.9 yuan to 19

yuan, this month's asking price is 19.5 yuan,

next month is 20 yuan, Treasure fine twill is 16

yuan two jiao and a half. The Tianjin gang only has transfers, Qin

Huangdao has slightly added to the amount, the export trend has gradually become stagnant,

so the street transaction, the whole day's opening only four

or five hundred pieces, but colored goods, Serge, Straight tribute are relatively stable.

Export: On the 15th, the piece goods export

six hundred and thirty pieces transported to Tang

Gu, two hundred and twenty pieces transported to

Yantai, two hundred and twenty-seven pieces transported to Da Port,

Grain Expensive

### The Root Treatment of Seminal Emission: Sexually Transmitted Diseases Specialist Doctor Zhan Nian Zeng

Because we know that there are many quack

doctors who treat people, just perfunctorily temporarily

, this although adapts to the wrong psychology of the patient

, and fills his pockets, but other people's lives

are equal to my life, the patient comes seeking treatment with pain, and the doctor instead

plays with him treating his life like a game, how can it not

be a heinous crime?

The disease of seminal emission, although without pain, but

the result is ten thousand times dangerous! The world really

does not know how many young people are buried in the

painful abyss after seminal emission is not treated. Why do young

people have seminal emission, no more than the following

reasons: (1) unrestrained masturbation, (2)

early marriage, excessive sexual desire; (3) congenital weakness and disharmony after illness; (4) excessive use of the brain and effort, and

excessive sorrow, etc. Among the above reasons, the

reason for unrestrained masturbation is the most numerous.

Because this kind of hookup is most likely to damage the sex nerves,

making the sperm gate relaxed, and seminal emission will follow.

Once seminal emission occurs, a radical

treatment plan should be made immediately, and it must not be procrastinated. Because

seminal emission lasts for a long time, the function of the sperm gate will be more relaxed, and this will cause spermatorrhea.

There are countless cases, however, the vitality is also greatly

lost. Therefore, all brain decline forgetfulness, insomnia

palpitation, sore waist back pain, kidney atrophy premature ejaculation,

incomplete development, premature aging and other symptoms

will follow, this kind of man must look

withered, much pain, much disease, suffering,

seeking to learn, nothing achieved, the future is bleak!

Between men and women, and will be

discarded by women, hated by wives, life

happiness, completely lost!

Regarding the fundamental treatment of seminal emission,

daily life attention to health, such as abstinence from self

deception, not reading lewd books, diligent exercise,

often washing the local area with cold water, are all beneficial

, but effective drugs are also necessary. According to the world

famous doctor and my experience, it is believed that taking "

Hemitol sperm strengthening tablets" is indeed

effective in consolidating the sperm gate, tranquilizing the nerves, and sleeping to stop seminal emission. If seminal emission has the above symptoms

, it is necessary to also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "

Reproductive Hormone" to nourish the brain and kidneys, essence and blood and

nerves, continuing to take it, must be able to restore

to perfection in a short period of time, patients who can personally

come to this clinic to use the latest electrotherapy injections

and other therapies, can guarantee a radical cure.

### How to Practice Moderation in Marriage and the Harm of Indulgence

Marital love is built on the foundation of sexual life, and I'm afraid no one can deny that! A man with abundant energy who marries a healthy and beautiful wife certainly does not treat her as a "vase" or idol, but warmly embraces her as the soul in his heart, the entirety of life. From the union of two lives, a new little life is born, so the loving couple's bearing sons and daughters is a natural result. However, the love between husband and wife can easily be misunderstood as indulgence; in fact, love needs moderation to grow. We know that a woman's physiology has only one sexual climax in each menstrual cycle. Although there may be a few small waves near the climax, sexual activity is absolutely not suitable before and after menstruation. As for before and after a wife's childbirth, the husband must engage in several months of moderation. If he can use his energy on his career and academics at this time, not only will his career and academics progress, but it will also be very beneficial to his body and mind! Regarding the physiology of men and women, although there are no such characteristics as women, the semen needed in sexual life is extremely precious. A man with abundant energy has as many as 200 trillion to 500 trillion sperm in one ejaculation, as well as many liquids that nourish the sperm. These substances are calcium and phosphorus, which are produced through the most advanced and complex differentiation in the body, and are the main materials for our brain, kidneys, and nerves. Therefore, any man who has committed self-pollution, night emission, or post-marital licentiousness in his early years and has exhausted his semen (i.e., reproductive gland fluid) will inevitably suffer from kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, brain weakness, insomnia, incomplete development, premature aging, and seminal thinness and infertility. This is extremely dangerous! Loving couples, they are indeed unwilling to easily give up the opportunity to enjoy themselves in a timely manner, but they must encourage each other to practice moderation in order to improve their health and ensure the eternity of their love. If they suffer from the above-mentioned symptoms due to physical weakness or youthful ignorance, they must also seek radical treatment as early as possible. Losing the ability to be sexually healthy will betray their lover and become a sinner in love. His suffering is difficult for others to understand even one ten-thousandth!

For the above symptoms, to seek rescue, according to the world's famous doctors' thousands of medical records and my many years of experience, taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone" is the most suitable and effective. This agent is made by replicating the reproductive gland hormone extracted from strong animals such as apes, orangutans, and sea dogs using scientific methods, so the quality is precious and the efficacy is reliable, which is unmatched by any pill and sperm quality preparation. After taking it, it can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves in one day and night. Continuing to take it can also promote development and adjust metabolism. The above symptoms can be completely cured in a short period of time. Regular consumption in autumn and winter can also prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Hemitol Sperm Strengthening Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that the treatment of both the symptoms and the root cause can achieve faster results!

Patient Mr. Han Yifei suffered from severe kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation after marriage, and also had seminal emission. Last month, he was introduced by a friend to be treated. I immediately adopted a treatment method that addressed both the root cause and symptoms, instructing him to purchase and take "Reproductive Hormone" and "Hemitol Sperm Strengthening Tablets" at the Zhongxi Pharmacy. In about a month, the disease was completely cured, his complexion was rosy, and his energy was abundant.

Beauty and Health

### Do Not Neglect the Shrinking of Breasts!

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Abundant Breasts: Boundless Happiness! Deflated Breasts: A Fateful Journey Full of Tribulations!

Based on physiological research and factual evidence, we have the following two very apt conclusions about the development of a woman's breasts. 1. Because a woman's breasts are well-developed, forming a high and elastic state, then her reproductive gland, the ovaries, must be exceptionally strong. Consequently, the tissues of all parts of her body are also very healthy and harmonious. Therefore, her buttocks are full, her muscles are smooth and supple, her figure is flexible, and her cheeks are like the flowers of spring. In terms of her external appearance, she has reached the ultimate in elegance and charm. Who could see her without a stirring in their heart? 2. Since the tissues of all parts are very healthy and harmonious, then her thoughts, temperament, wisdom, and judgment are all superior. In terms of studying, she easily comprehends. In terms of learning arts, (including literature, embroidery, knitting, sewing, and everything else), she also easily excels. In terms of treating people, she always greets them with a smiling face, gentle and lovely. Such women, beautiful outside and intelligent inside, are what men of the times seek but cannot find. Therefore, once married, the husband invariably loves her as a treasure. How could her happiness be limited? As for women with shrunken breasts, that is truly tragic! On the one hand, because of their weak bodies, they suffer from diseases and pain. On the other hand, because of the loss of beauty, even if they wear silk and embroidered clothes, they inevitably cannot avoid being criticized and ridiculed by discerning people. Therefore, as virgins, no one ardently pursues them, often leading to a lonely life. After marriage, the love between husband and wife is also very weak, even to the point of having no children and being abandoned by the husband! They feel lost and adrift! The only remedy is to immediately take the female "Reproductin," a preparation made from the secretions of the reproductive gland ovaries, so that they can fulfill their wishes. This preparation is made from the essence of healthy animal ovaries. Therefore, after taking it, the function of the ovaries can be nourished and supplemented day and night, promoting metabolism, regulating menstruation, and warming the uterus to stop leucorrhea. If taken continuously, it will surely make the breasts rise high and full in a short period, and the cheeks become rosy, transforming ugliness into beauty, and increasing their boundless happiness.

### The Root Treatment for Seminal Emission

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

Because we know that many quack doctors treat patients by merely perfunctorily going through the motions, although this caters to the erroneous mentality of the patients and fills their own pockets, other people’s lives are equal to my own. Patients come seeking treatment with pain and suffering, but the doctors play with them and treat their lives as a joke. Isn't that extremely sinful?

Although seminal emission causes no pain or itching, its consequences are extremely dangerous! How many young people in this world are buried in the painful abyss after seminal emission is left untreated! Why do young people have seminal emission? It is nothing more than the following reasons: (1) excessive masturbation; (2) early marriage and indulgence in sex; (3) congenital weakness and imbalance after illness; (4) excessive use of the brain and excessive sorrow, etc. Among the above reasons, excessive masturbation is the most common cause. Because this kind of behavior most easily damages the sexual nerves and relaxes the seminal valves, seminal emission then arises.

Once seminal emission occurs, a fundamental treatment plan should be made, and procrastination should never be allowed. Because with prolonged seminal emission, the function of the seminal valves will inevitably become particularly relaxed, resulting in spermatorrhea. However, the vitality is also greatly depleted. Therefore, symptoms such as brain weakness and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and premature aging follow one after another. Such men will inevitably look haggard, suffer from pain and illness, endure hardship, and achieve nothing in their studies and careers. Their future is bleak! In relations between men and women, they will be rejected by women and hated by their wives. The happiness of life will be completely lost!

Regarding the fundamental treatment of seminal emission, attention to daily life and health, such as abstaining from self-pollution, not reading obscene books and paintings, exercising diligently, and regularly washing the local area with cold water, are all beneficial, but effective drugs are also necessary. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Simituo's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" is indeed effective in consolidating the seminal valves, calming the nerves, promoting sleep, and stopping seminal emission. If the above-mentioned symptoms have already occurred due to seminal emission, then it is also necessary to take the reproductive gland preparation "Reproductin" to nourish the brain and kidneys, essence and blood, and nerves. With continued use, it will surely be possible to restore perfect health in a short period. If patients can come to this clinic in person to receive the latest therapies such as electrotherapy injections, a fundamental cure can be guaranteed.

### New Value of Electrotherapy in Treating Gonorrhea

In the past decade, there has been a leap forward in the treatment of gonorrhea, and in terms of physical therapy, there has been significant progress. Taking electrotherapy in physical therapy as an example, initially, wavelengths were used. Later, it was discovered that long-wave electrotherapy could not exert its sterilization characteristics in certain situations. Therefore, further research and improvements were made, and short waves were invented. In terms of application and sterilization efficiency, it is indeed beyond the reach of long waves. However, there are still shortcomings in certain situations, and long waves still have advantages. Therefore, long- and short-wave electrotherapy complement each other in the treatment of gonorrhea and cannot be neglected. However, there are many shortcomings in both, which cannot be listed. Therefore, the progress of electrical equipment itself is increasingly evident through the tireless and meticulous research of general scholars. Generally speaking, the electrotherapy used by general physicians is mostly outdated and insufficient to meet our ideal sterilization effect. Therefore, the general superficial and ignorant people generally deny it, which is too much. Because the most ideal electrotherapy—filtered laminar electrotherapy—has now been invented.

Filtered laminar electrotherapy is the latest invention in the German electrotherapy community. Its penetration and sterilization power are just right, without the drawbacks of being excessive or insufficient. It can thoroughly eliminate gonococci in the local area of acute and chronic gonorrhea. Therefore, all major venereal disease hospitals in Europe and the United States are equipped with filtered laminar electrotherapy machines. Since the invention of filtered laminar electrotherapy, electrotherapy has been re-evaluated in the treatment of gonorrhea. Based on my experience of more than ten years, filtered laminar electrotherapy is the best in electrotherapy. If the condition can be carefully observed and supplemented with symptomatic therapy, such as prostate massage for prostatitis and Xi's serum for arthritis, a radical cure can be guaranteed within a limited time. Because filtered electrotherapy can sterilize and filter out gonorrhea toxins, and serum can eliminate gonococci in the blood.

### Two "Sitting" from "Law" to "Literature"

— Qing Hou

Perhaps because I like miscellaneous things, I sometimes always read books other than the specialized books of so-called "literati," and I especially love to browse through our consistently available law books. The reason for that is not because I want to get a doctorate in law, but because I want to study the intention of "legislation," and I want to study how a certain "law" makes it easy for people to "play with the law."

In fact, what I am researching is still the tricks of the "literati." Because our so-called "Legalists" throughout history have been fundamentally inseparable from the literati. The "law" established by the Legalists is, in essence, meant to deal with the common people. The reason why literati rarely "break the law" is because they "know the law," and it is precisely because they "know the law" that they can "play with the law," and finally use the "law" to cover up their own "lawlessness." -- Of course, there are also those who "make a law and are killed by it themselves."

I feel that in our consistently available "law," the most powerful are "collective liability" and "reciprocal accusation."

According to the "Records of the Grand Historian," "collective liability" was invented by the ancestor of the Legalists, Shang Yang. Later, it was also called "green liability," which is already very common in the "Tang Law Subcommentaries." In short, it is to arrest and prosecute or behead the fathers, sons, brothers, and younger brothers of the criminal. In the consistently available "law," it seems that only the "relatives" are encircled by "liability," and the oldest "Tang Law" still has the words "non-cohabitants" for "relatives," but in fact, it is often not the case. Once "collective liability" arises, not only the "non-cohabitant" relatives of the criminal will be dragged in, but also non-relatives, and even people who are completely irrelevant. The "melon vine search" of the Ming Dynasty was like this, and the literary inquisition of the Qing Dynasty also used this "law." This is indeed extremely enjoyable for the executor.

I don't know who invented "reciprocal accusation," I only know that it already existed in the oldest "Tang Law." According to the consistently available express provisions, it is naturally reasonable: to make another person subject to criminal punishment, and the crime is not established, you must become a criminal yourself. The "Tang Law" says, "Those who falsely accuse people will all be reciprocally accused." But this is just express wording on paper, and the facts later are often not the case. Often the plaintiff is not "falsely accusing," but will be "falsely" accused of "falsely accusing." At this time, the trick of "playing with the law" appears. And often something was done by the defendant, but the defendant can put that thing on the plaintiff in the same way. -- This trick is what is said in the past petitions, "retaliation," which is considered the most terrible trick.

These are all "old laws." Although I have not studied the "new laws," I have heard that "collective liability" has been abolished. As for "reciprocal accusation," it probably exists, but it is said that the malpractices are less, but I still don't quite understand how it is.

But although some have been abolished, and some of the malpractices have become less, the remaining power of these two kinds of "laws" can still be found in the society of "literati." I have also researched this a little bit.

For example, if a literati's nose is hit, he angrily pushes his own "characteristics" to the other party, the style is: "You say I am reactionary, but in fact you are reactionary!" -- This is the application of the reciprocal accusation method. For example, if a literati's nose is hit, he curses all the people around the person who hit him, even if those people have nothing to do with his perceived enemy, he just insists that they are all the same faction. -- This is the application of the collective liability method. If the two "sitting" are used together, it will be even more powerful, so the literati thinks that he has won.

The literati has not yet mastered the "literature," and first learned this trick, so it is better not to say it. Just looking at the "law" of these two old methods, if it is completely applied to "literature," in my opinion, it is difficult to be sure of a real victory. To really "play with the law" is not an easy task: to evolve reciprocal accusation into retaliation, it is also necessary to create some evidence of retaliation. If you only learn the shrew-like tone of "You say I am stealing a man, but in fact you are stealing a man," it is always difficult to convince people. Even if you are blushing, you can only make people feel funny. The application of the collective liability method is even more difficult: because the literati at this time is not the executor of the "law" after all, and since he cannot actually investigate, he can only rely on the method of smelling. However, this is going to cause problems, either mistaking two people for one person, or mistaking an outsider for an insider. Although you think it is extremely enjoyable, in fact, it can only make people feel funny.

The two "sitting" do not work, the old "law" is difficult to "play with," the literati's jumping is ineffective, and it is really the era that makes it so.

However, it can also be interpreted in another way. Hasn't the newspaper ever published that a certain party is implementing collective liability? At the same time, hasn't the newspaper also told us that under the "law" of a certain party, people are often punished for "false accusation"? Then, our literati can also be said to be catering to the spirit of the "new era."

### Three Eggs

— Lin Quan

At noon, the sun rose to the top of my head, and the hot wind swept up the dust from the ground; among the forests, the dense leaves drooped wearily. The mountains squatted like sleepy old men.

I was walking alone on the field ridges. My legs were very sore, my head was a little dizzy, and the military bag on my arm became heavier.

The village in front, the roosters crowed at noon. The yellow dirt road stretched endlessly forward.

The village was just ahead. Looking at the trees and thatched huts at the entrance of the village, I supported my tired body and walked forward with more effort. My mouth was so dry that it was about to crack, and my eyes were blurring.

"Female soldier! Female soldier! New Fourth Army!... "

By a small river at the entrance of the village, the children stopped their water games and pointed and shouted at me.

An old woman was sitting on the threshold of a thatched hut, picking broad beans, and a flock of chicks were pecking at the broad bean shells next to her feet.

"Old grandma! Picking beans!"

I went over and greeted her.

"Picking beans! Ah! 'Comrade,' you've worked hard? Where are you from?"

The old woman was very kind and cheerful. Her clean salt-cloth jacket had patches, and a pair of red embroidered slippers on her small feet looked like two pairs of dazzling red water chestnuts.

"My brother is also in your unit! My brother Li Tianfu, he's called Li Tianfu!"

The children also gathered around. A small pockmarked face, a little unnatural but very proud, raised his eyebrows high and said to me. The other children stared at him with envious eyes, and the roots of the little scab's ears turned red.

"His brother went to your team last winter, he insisted on going himself! Your team is really good, this old grandma! "

The old woman supplemented the words of the little scab, and then pulled me to rest in the house, there was another guest in the house.

"Your comrades can do work! The reasoning is really good! The farmers' resistance association there in ×× shop has set up a cooperative, it's easy to borrow money, otherwise, in this time of year between crops... "

The guest was the director of the Farmers' Resistance Association of ×× shop. The work there was being talked about with great enthusiasm.

"Don't let that female comrade leave! The noodles are in the pot!"

The old woman shouted in the kitchen, I don't know when she went in again.

"Old grandma! How can this work? I've eaten on the way, and I have to hurry... "

I declined, feeling very uneasy. I stood up and wanted to leave, but the guest pulled me back.

"There's nothing to eat in the countryside, just a little noodles. It's still ten miles to ×× shop! "

So I had to sit down full of unease.

The noodles were brought up, they were boiled in plain water. There were a few spots of oil and a few leaves of green vegetables floating on top.

"This is really embarrassing! Really shouldn't... "

What's embarrassing, you yourselves say that the army of the people is one family! - Last year, many of your comrades came here, and also built a stage for opera! Don't look at me being old and useless, I understand what your comrades say... Eat! Come outside to eat, there's wind, it's cooler. How can you walk with your stomach full?... "

The old woman gave a large bowl of noodles to the guest, and a small bowl to me. The noodles were steaming, scalding hot. I turned the noodles with my chopsticks, and when all the noodles were picked up, suddenly, I noticed that there were three eggs hidden under the noodles! I immediately guessed sensitively what was going on, so I looked up at the guest's bowl opposite, he was also picking up the noodles and turning them, but there was nothing at the bottom of the bowl.

"It's really hot, let's blow some wind!"

I said unnaturally, and sat on the threshold with the bowl. There was some wind outside, and the vast fields stretched out. The children jumped into the water to catch fish, and the chicks were still pecking at the broad bean shells by the ash heap. A pair of old yellow dogs lay down in the dense shade of the elm tree. Everything was gentle and quiet. I looked down again at the three eggs in the bowl...

In my heart, excitement and joy made me jump up. Turning my head back, I met the old woman's kind and sincere gaze, and a burst of burning sensation climbed onto my cheeks. I knew my face must be red.

It has a loud voice,

My iron helmet keeps,

Bumping against the wall of the car.

The soldiers only know how to smile,

Looking at each other happily,

The woods outside the window fly by:

Train! Please carry us quickly,

To the front lines!

We are not afraid of death and injury,

We only love our country and home,

The time for fighting has arrived:

Train! Run with all your might!

Our hearts are faster than yours!

### Picture

— Liu Lan

In quiet, peaceful years, who doesn't have fantasies and reveries? The harmonious realm woven by music tubes and keys, don't you admire it? I prefer to use the colorful brush of fantasy to depict the images of the soul.

Now, it is a different mood, quite thinking of drawing a few comic strips:

The crows carry the setting sun, one by one returning to the forest, the village bathed in the red light is quiet and beautiful.

Iron crows track and come. Circling and circling again.

Boom, boom... lulululu...

The soil turned over, and flesh and blood irrigated the land. (The seeds of resentment are sown, and the children of the earth will take revenge.)

The setting sun may be unbearable to witness, and falls down sadly. The fire burns fiercely, reflecting half the sky red; it counts as a substitute for it.

The iron crow goes back whistling "victory."

Cries, calls, and moans burst the brain of the universe. The moon painfully reveals its pale face, sighing as it looks at the suffering earth.

But the living are angry.

"Go to the mountains." "Pull them out." The loud roar echoes from the wilderness to the wilderness. Arms are raised like a forest.

The wilderness is boiling.

### Entertainment Programs at the New York World's Fair

— Xin Ying

In addition to displaying various commodities and artworks, the New York World's Fair also offers all kinds of entertainment. Here are some special programs:

(1) Wireless Film: Wireless film is becoming a reality in the United States this year. At the New York World's Fair, not only is a wireless film screening room being set up, but also various scenes from the fairground are being captured by wireless film and broadcast to countries around the world. Therefore, the situation of the fairground can also be seen in wireless films in European countries.

(2) Electric Puppets: There is an American puppet show expert named Oona Walff, whose puppet show does not use hand-operated strings but uses electric strings, which is also a new invention. Recently, his full electric puppet troupe also performed publicly at the New York World's Fair, and the performances were all famous world-renowned operas, which were generally well received.

(3) Nude Performance: Nude performance is a very stimulating entertainment at the New York World's Fair. Beforehand, some people vehemently opposed this kind of performance, but in the end it was still performed publicly. And there were several scenes that were completely nude. The performers were all healthy and beautiful girls. In addition to the ordinary programs, there was also a nude swimming performance, which was very exciting.

(4) Beauty Exhibition: A Paradise Park has been built in the New York World's Fair, and for the need of some beauties to decorate it, a selection was made in the western United States beforehand, and as many as eleven Hollywood beauty stars were selected. These women are all on display in Paradise Park, like a beauty exhibition.

(5) Grand Premiere: The blockbuster film "New Gold Mountain," which was recently shown at the Grand Light Cinema, was shown worldwide for the first time at the New York World's Fair not long ago, and the ceremony was quite grand. On the first night, only officials and diplomats from various countries were allowed to visit. Because the story depicts the scenery of Australia, the Australian consul in New York also visited that night. From the second night onwards, it was open to the public, and anyone could go and appreciate it. From then on, it was sold out for several days in a row.

(6) Other: In addition to the various kinds mentioned above, all kinds of dramas, operas, music, as well as circuses, acrobatics, etc., that are popular in the United States, are almost all collected at this New York World's Fair. Therefore, it takes at least a few weeks for a tourist to see all these entertainments!

### Anti-Japanese War Documentary "Blood Splattered Baoshan City" Premieres in Chongqing

— Hui Cun

—Received unanimous praise from public opinion

After leaving Shanghai for Hong Kong, the famous director Situ Huimin collaborated with Cai Chusheng to produce a "Blood Splattered Baoshan City." The story tells that Battalion Commander Yao Ziqing of the Ninety-eighth Division led more than 600 brothers to defend Baoshan City to the death until it was lost. All of the more than 600 brothers in the entire battalion, except for one who left the city to ask for help, all died. The plot is tragic and fierce, both lamentable and praiseworthy. The film and the "China Electric" production "Orphan City Bloodshed," which was released before moving to Chongqing, are based on the same material and have the same effect. However, the plot is slightly different. The film stars the hard-line young actor Li Qing and Chen Yunshang, and was completed last year. It was immediately shown in Hong Kong and was praised by the audience and praised by various newspapers.

Now, the film has been transferred to Chongqing and is being shown at the Unique Cinema. In recent days, the box office has been very good, and audiences are crowding in, making it difficult for the theater to cope. There is no other way but to extend the screening period, so the film is still being shown. (Note: There are several cinemas in Chongqing with relatively perfect equipment, including "Guotai," "Xinchuan," and "Unique." Since the Japanese aircraft attacked Chongqing, "Guotai" was burned down and "Xinchuan" was bombed. Now, the only remaining one is "Unique" (it is truly unique). The area of the theater is not very large, and part of it has been opened up as a refugee shelter, so the scope is even smaller. When the film "Defend the Homeland" was shown last time, the audience was extremely crowded. When the excellent national defense film "Blood Splattered Baoshan City" was opened, the box office success should also be no exception.

### Beiping Theater News: Updating the Stage and Inviting Famous Actors

— Yan Yan

First Group Changed to Wu Suqiu, Gou Huisheng Will Take Over Afterwards

Shanghai's Updating Stage sent Zheng Zibao and Du Juchu from the Ju Chu Society to Beiping to invite actors. They are quite active and, after much negotiation, have now made headway. In addition to Wu Suqiu, Zhao Xiaolan, and Li Shixiu, three female actors, having been secured for the ribbon-cutting and opening ceremony on the first day, the full cast has also been finalized. The veteran actor (male) is Chen Shaolin, the martial actor is Liang Huichao (currently performing with Lü Huijun at the Tianjin Grand Theater), the female actor is Wei Lianfang, the supporting veteran actor is Zhang Chunyan, the old female actor is Li Duokui, the comedian is Sun Shengwu, and the painted face actor is yet to be determined. Among them, the young male actor is the most sought after, and it is the famous Yu Zhenfei.

The above full cast is scheduled to depart on the 28th of this month, at the latest by the end of the month. However, Zhao Xiaolan's departure may be earlier. As for the opening date of Updating Stage, it is confirmed to be September 10th. On the first day, Wu, Zhao, and Li will jointly perform a fine play, the title of which is yet to be determined, but it will be either "Dragon and Phoenix Bring Prosperity" or "The Four or Five Flower Caves." Afterwards, Wu Suqiu will perform solo. It is said that the people of Shanghai have high expectations for Wu.

Xun Huisheng has indeed been successfully invited by Updating Stage, but the date may be delayed. Xun has not performed in Shanghai for a long time, mainly due to seasickness. This time, Zheng Zibao and Du Juchu came north with a handwritten letter from Zhang Xiaolin. Zhang and Xun have a teacher-student relationship, so Xun cannot refuse. Xun's departure is scheduled for mid-next month.

Following Wu and Xun, Li Wanchun, Tan Fuying, and others will come in succession. However, recently, both Golden Stage and Updating Stage have sent people to invite actors, and negotiations with famous actors are frequent, so news is diverging. The final decision is difficult to generalize at this time. However, the above news is all reliable, so it is described in detail above, which should be welcome news for the people of Shanghai.

Random Notes of Artists

### "Chen Charles' Confession" (Part 1)

— Xu Xinyuan

— Thoughts on Filming Detective Movies

Editor's Introduction: Mr. Xu Xinyuan is a veteran of the silver screen, and his reputation has long been established. Because he was born with an extraordinary physique and is also very experienced in acting, his portrayals of warlords, bureaucrats, and large-bellied merchants are lifelike and show his spirit. Speaking of the silver screen's veteran actor type, since Shang Guanwu passed away in his later years, everyone pushes him as the leading figure, worthy of the name, and not a false reputation. Recently, he played the role of detective "Chinese Chen Charles," creating a new path for domestic films, with many excellent achievements. This article focuses on this, and elaborates on detective dramas, which is worthy of attention.

Who to act as a detective for, I have heard people say this, but I have not experienced it myself. I thought it was the same as acting, the same expression, what's so difficult? How could I know that when I joined the Xinhua Company to film "Chen Charles Returns to China," the first detective case "The Pearl Shirt," I already felt that it was indeed not easy. We actors, no matter what role we play, whether it is a bureaucrat, a politician, a wealthy merchant, or a local tyrant, there is always a model standard. As long as we grasp the personality of the character in the play, of course, we can play whoever we resemble, at least with some certainty. Only when playing the role of a detective, in fact, Chinese society lacks such a person, and it is simply impossible to imitate. It is even more difficult to play "Chen Charles." Although Warner Oland, who plays Chen Charles in the United States, has had many films shown in China, his plot and actions are completely Westernized, and mostly different from our customs. For example, there are many newly invented scientific and medical machines in the play, which are not only rare in China, but even if there are any, it is difficult to do because filming is limited by capital. As for Warner Oland's slow expression and lack of spirit, Chen Charles should not have this typical characteristic. It is all foreigners deliberately exaggerating when playing Chinese people, so my actions in the "Pearl Shirt" play do not completely imitate Warner Oland, and Director Xu Xinfu also instructed me not to be too lacking in spirit, to take his strengths and discard his weaknesses. When the film was successfully shot and publicly screened, the audience's comments were: some said the appearance was very similar, but the expression and actions were too slow; some said the movements were delayed, very much like Chen Charles' posture. This made me feel caught in a dilemma, not knowing what to do, which really made the actors suffer.

### Ms. Zheng Shujuan of the Xinhua Song and Dance Troupe

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muxue

The Long-Legged General is Busy Hanging and Splitting Plaques at the Private Party

Those who attended the grand event that day, in addition to Chen, included Mr. Li Wei'wu, who once served as the commander-in-chief of the Restoration Army, as well as Wu Guangxin and Pan Xinhang. At that time, everyone saw their affectionate situation and felt that in this day of war and turmoil, if the Zhili faction generals were to retaliate, the Xuzhou relationship would be extremely important. Zhang and Chen already had a sworn brotherhood, and Chen came in person to express his goodwill, it seemed that in times of emergency, Chen would be able to give Zhang friendly assistance. Who knew that not long after, Zhejiang Governor Sun Chuanfang, in the name of autumn exercises, defeated the Feng army in Shanghai, Ningbo, Bengbu, and Suzhou with lightning speed. At that time, Chen Xuexuan had already ceded the Anhui governorship to Jiang Chao-liu, but because of the alliance brother's recommendation to Zhang Shao-shuai (Hanqing), he was still able to station his old subordinates in Bengbu, Suzhou, and other places in some capacity. When Xing Shilian and Yang Yuting successively lost Shanghai and Ningbo and fled north in embarrassment, they never expected to suddenly encounter Chen Xuexuan's head-on attack between Bengbu and Suzhou. Such a sudden encounter battle not only made it impossible for Yang, Xing, and others to fight, but even Anhui Governor Jiang Dengxuan had to suddenly leave Anhui and flee to Xuzhou due to the influence of the illness at his side. At this time, Zhang Zongchang, upon hearing that Chen Diaoyuan had suddenly changed and secretly colluded with Sun Xinyuan to attack their Feng army and himself, immediately fell to the ground in his Xuzhou headquarters like a "stiff zombie." When he regained consciousness, he repeatedly scolded himself for being a bastard and not recognizing people. If he had known he would be like this today, he would have solved him together when the Feng army launched a major southward offensive, to avoid today's major harm. As he was saying this, he suddenly looked up and saw the birthday plaque that had just been hung up not long ago was still hanging high in the central hall, the upper and lower inscriptions written so affectionately. Reflecting on today's situation of disregarding faith and suddenly becoming enemies, the long-legged general ordered his subordinates to move the plaque off the ground, and with a knife in his hand, he chopped and split the lower inscription, cursing incessantly, revealing his crude bandit nature. He did not stop chopping until his hand was sore and the knife was broken, and the ground was covered with pieces of wood. After a short time, he ordered people to carry it to the yard, set it on fire, and then felt a little better in his heart. — (August 1) —
