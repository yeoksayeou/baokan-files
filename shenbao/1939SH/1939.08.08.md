### Chinese Troops Between Tongbai and Dahong Mountains Surround Japanese Forces from the North and South; Japanese Troops in Southeastern Shanxi Flee to Wenxi, Anyi, and Yuncheng; Zhongshan Authorities Order Coastal Defense Forces to Be on Alert Against Further Japanese Incursions; Japanese Train Near Jianshanpu Destroyed

(Chongqing) According to recent telegrams received here, Chinese artillery units are active again in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. At around 10:55 AM on August 1st, Chinese artillery in a certain location in Anhui Province bombarded a large Japanese transport ship, scoring nine direct hits and causing significant damage. In northern Hubei, Japanese troops in Qian County and Sui County, aided by mechanized units and aircraft, launched an offensive northwestward, fiercely attacking Chinese positions at Lishan. Intense bombing by Japanese aircraft and artillery forced Chinese troops to abandon their positions at Lishan at noon on August 5th. Chinese troops operating along the southern ridge of the Tongbai Mountains have recaptured Tianhekou and are now advancing southward, hoping to strike the northern flank of the Japanese troops moving west from Lishan. Meanwhile, Chinese forces in the Tongbai and Dahong Mountains are currently surrounding Japanese troops from both the north and south. The fighting in southeastern Shanxi is now concentrated around Jincheng. After the Japanese troops were routed to the east, they are now retreating towards the Tongpu Railway in the direction of Wenxi, Xiaxian, Anyi, and Yuncheng. Chinese troops are currently surrounding Xiaxian, and Jincheng is also under siege. On the afternoon of August 1st, a portion of the Japanese troops in the city, with the assistance of four field guns and eight tanks, broke through Chinese lines to the south and fled along the highway towards Bo'ai, the western end of the Daoqing Railway.

(Hong Kong) This morning, over thirty artillery rounds were heard in the northwestern corner of Zhongshan, fired by Japanese troops in Jiangmen to deter a Chinese counteroffensive. There are six or seven Japanese shallow-water vessels and thirty or forty rubber boats and armed fishing boats along the Beijie River. To prevent further Japanese incursions, Zhongshan authorities have ordered coastal defense forces to be on alert. (Special Dispatch, 7th)

In the past three days, Chinese troops in Miluo encountered a large Japanese battalion dispatched to Taolin for reinforcements in the area north of Dayun Mountain and south of Yangqiaolou Sizaoli. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the entire Japanese force was annihilated by the morning of the 6th. The Japanese left behind over three hundred corpses in the area, and Chinese troops seized dozens of machine guns and rifles, and over a hundred mountain artillery shells. In addition, another Chinese unit ambushed and destroyed a Japanese train near Jianshanpu, near Linxiang, on the evening of the 2nd. (Telegraph, 7th)

### Fei Wusheng Personally Witnesses the New Dalai Lama's Journey to Tibet

(Chongqing) Mr. Fei Wusheng, the former secretary of the Shanghai YMCA, personally witnessed the journey of the new Dalai Lama and his entourage to Lhasa. He is the only foreigner to have seen this. Fei arrived at the Kongbang Monastery (transliteration) in Qinghai Province half an hour before the Dalai Lama's arrival. However, due to haste, he loaded previously exposed film into the camera, missing the opportunity to take pictures. Fei saw sixteen aircraft at the Lanzhou airfield presented to the Chinese government by the people of Xinjiang Chinese Turkestan. It is said that the highway between Xining and Lanzhou will be completed within a month, reducing the journey between the two places from three days to one day, as this new road is a shortcut.

### Details of British Ship Bombed in Yichang; British Officer Lodges Protest

(Yichang) Eighteen Japanese aircraft bombed Yichang fiercely at around 6 AM on the 6th. Aside from the destruction of several civilian houses and the deaths and injuries of over eighty civilians, there were no other losses for the Chinese side. However, the British Jardine Matheson and Hsing Chang & Co. ships were bombed and destroyed, injuring the British chief mate, Mr. Dania, and killing four Chinese crew members and injuring over twenty others. A bomb landed near the Taikoo Dockyard, causing the collapse of several sections of the wall. At around 11 AM, another ten Japanese aircraft infiltrated the city's airspace and bombed and destroyed the British Chia Ho ship, with no casualties. The British Asiatic Petroleum Company oil depot was heavily bombed, with three heavy bombs landing in the depot, destroying the oil storage room and warehouses, and injuring several workers. In addition, several incendiary bombs landed in a certain location, setting fire to over thirty houses and killing and injuring over seventy civilians. The Japanese aircraft exclusively targeted British expatriates and British commercial properties during this bombing raid, causing outrage among all foreign expatriates in Yichang, who are reportedly planning collective retaliation for this Japanese act of violence. Several reporters and expatriates, standing at the highest point outside the city, witnessed the Japanese aircraft dropping bombs in great detail. The Japanese aircraft initially dropped several bombs in the suburbs, then immediately changed formation and circled the expatriate district along the river, flying at low altitude and conducting reconnaissance for a long time, before concentrating on targeting the British warship HMS Gnat in the river and the Hsing Chang & Co. ship of Jardine Matheson, aiming and dropping bombs. At the time, the fuselage was only a few feet away from the ship's bridge. After repeated bombing by the Japanese aircraft, flames suddenly erupted and a strange sound was heard, and the Hsing Chang & Co. ship was destroyed. Many bombs were dropped into the river, and the HMS Gnat was severely shaken, but fortunately it was not hit. After the bombing, the Japanese aircraft circled the ship twice before flying away. The second wave of ten Japanese aircraft infiltrated the airspace above Yichang at around 11 AM, flying for two weeks. The Japanese aircraft changed formation in the same way as before and repeatedly bombed the Asiatic Petroleum Company oil depot and the Chia Ho ship of Jardine Matheson, which was moored nearby in the river. The Japanese aircraft first concentrated on dropping bombs into the Asiatic Petroleum Company oil depot, and amidst the raging fire and explosions, several aircraft flew low over the Chia Ho ship and began bombing. The ship was almost entirely destroyed, leaving only a few iron ribs. Both ships and the roof of the Asiatic Petroleum Company oil depot displayed large British flags, and the British coat of arms painted on the ships' hulls were clearly visible. When the Japanese aircraft circled over the river, they used machine guns to strafe all ships displaying British flags, so many British ships are riddled with bullet holes. Afterwards, reporters visited HMS Gnat Captain and Acting British Consul in Yichang, Mr. Oppan, to express their condolences. Captain Oppan spoke to reporters, and his account of the bombing of the two ships was entirely consistent with what the reporters had witnessed. Captain Oppan also expressed his deep sympathy for the suffering of the Chinese people. Captain Oppan immediately telegraphed the British Consul-General and the highest-ranking British naval officer, reporting the incident. Captain Oppan has now received replies from the two British officials, stating that they have lodged serious protests with the Japanese authorities in Shanghai and Hankou. (Telegraph, 6th)

London This morning, the British newspapers in London expressed extreme outrage at the bombing of two British ships in Yichang by Japanese aircraft. Both ships were moored in a safe area, but after one was hit and caught fire, the second suffered the same fate. In addition to injured British sailors, Chinese sailors were also injured. Rear Admiral Holder, the senior British naval officer stationed in Yichang, has lodged a protest with the Japanese naval authorities. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)

### Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation

(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that since the past week (July 30th to August 5th), the fighting in Henan Province has been relatively intense. Our troops, taking advantage of the enemy's exhaustion, launched separate attacks and achieved many victories. The other fronts saw only sporadic fighting. Our mobile attacks have forced the enemy to spread themselves thin and struggle to cope, exposing their increasingly dire straits. The progress of the fighting is summarized below:

Shanxi Front: The enemy invading southeastern Shanxi, after being severely attacked by our forces last week, lost their bearings. The majority of their main force retreated north along the Baijin Highway, while the remaining three to four thousand troops remained trapped in Changzhi, Huguan, Jincheng, and other locations, desperately defending their positions with fortifications. After days of careful planning, we first cleared out the remaining enemy around Gaoping and along the Hongtun Highway. From the morning of the 1st, we launched a two-pronged attack on Changzhi and Huguan. The enemy resisted stubbornly, resulting in fierce fighting throughout the day, with heavy casualties on both sides. By nightfall, our troops finally charged into the city trenches under heavy fire. The enemy in Changzhi retreated eastward without engaging in street fighting, and the county seat was declared retaken. In Huguan, our troops engaged the enemy in fierce street fighting, destroying all enemy fortifications, barracks, and warehouses before returning to their original defenses at dawn. The Chinese forces besieging Jincheng, after three days of bloody fighting, killed over six hundred enemy troops. The remaining enemy troops retreated in disarray to Huguan through mountain passes, attempting to attack Licheng. Our main force is closely monitoring the situation. In southern Shanxi, the enemy has launched several attacks from Hongtong and Wan'anzhen, but were met with fierce resistance and suffered heavy casualties. Yesterday, our troops launched a surprise attack on the enemy's rear, surrounding Wan'anzhen. The enemy fled north in a panic, and the town was declared retaken. We are now advancing towards Hongtong.

Henan-Hubei Front: Since last week, the enemy in southern Henan, in addition to sending a portion of their forces north to capture Minggang and Lixindian, divided their main force into two groups, advancing towards Zibai and Biyang. Maoji, Guxianzhen, Xiaolindian, Wanggang, Pingchangguan, and Huaihedian were successively captured. This week, our forces completed their deployments and launched a full-scale offensive, achieving successive victories. On the 1st, we retook Maoji and Guxianzhen. On the 2nd, we retook Xiaolindian, Pingchangguan, and Huaihedian. On the 3rd, we retook Minggang and Lixindian, and then advanced south, surrounding and fiercely attacking the Japanese troops at Changzhaoguan, inflicting heavy casualties. The enemy's plan to attack north was thwarted, and they then attempted to harass from the southern side of the Tongbai Mountains. The center of the fighting gradually shifted to northern Hubei. Currently, there are four to five thousand Japanese troops in the area north of Sui County, engaged in fierce fighting with our forces in the area of Tianhekou, Chashan, Bijia Mountain, Yinjia Dian, Qilitang, and Diaoyutai. The Japanese are also constantly transporting reinforcements and ammunition by truck to Sui County from Anlu and Xihe. On the 2nd, seven Chinese trucks ambushed and destroyed two Japanese trucks, killing many Japanese soldiers. On the 3rd, a portion of the Japanese troops attacked Gaocheng (north of Xihe) in three routes: one from Shimen, one from Wanjia Dian, and one from Qigumiao. At the same time, the Japanese troops at Wusheng Pass also sent teams to attack Gaocheng and Lishan to coordinate their efforts. After separate engagements, both sides are engaged in fierce fighting, which is gradually expanding. (To be continued)

### Campbell Captures Panda, Approved for Transport to the United States

(Chongqing) A panda captured by Professor Campbell of the West China Union University in Chengdu was transported by plane from Chongqing to Hong Kong on the 5th, awaiting shipment to the St. Louis Zoo in the United States. The Chinese government recently issued an order prohibiting the export of pandas, but because Campbell's panda was captured before the order was issued, it was specially approved for export.

Editorial

### Will Japan Join the German-Italian Alliance?

At a time when negotiations in Tokyo have stalled and British and French military representatives have set off for the Soviet Union, the long-dormant question of Japan's accession to the German-Italian alliance has suddenly resurfaced. The ostentatious secret meetings between the Japanese ambassador to Italy, Shiratori, and the Japanese ambassador to Germany, Oshima, indicate that Japan is about to join the German-Italian alliance. In fact, military cooperation between Japan, Germany, and Italy is not a new phenomenon. The novelty lies in the intricate timing of the three countries' military alliance and British foreign policy.

The three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy not only share a political stench and collude in aggression, but also, for example, the fact that the Japanese ambassadors to Germany and Italy are both military men, the exchange of intelligence, the frequent visits of staff officers, the supply of aircraft and munitions from Germany and Italy to Japan, and the visits of Generals Terauchi and Kaku to Berlin all these facts are sufficient to show that although the three countries have not concluded a military alliance, their Anti-Comintern Pact is already full of the smell of gunpowder! Moreover, their actions have long been coordinated. The Japanese scholar Tomita Ishimaru said: "The Pacific problem and the European problem are closely related. For example, at the time of the Munich Agreement, the victory of Germany and Italy was due to Japan's support in the Far East, which made Britain wary and forced it to kowtow to Germany." He also said, "On the other hand, Germany's victory in the Munich Conference exposed Britain's weakness and made it easier for Japan to conquer Guangdong and Hainan Island. In short, the Pacific power struggle and the European power struggle are closely related. This is why Japan, surrounded by Britain and the United States, joined hands with Germany and Italy, destroying a corner of the encirclement, and unfolding the result of a common front of countries with 'nothing' against countries with 'something.'"

Having seen through the relationship between Japan, Germany, and Italy, one feels that the actual aggression of the past few years is more worthy of attention than the so-called conclusion of a military alliance. But European peacemakers are unwilling to understand this. Although they have witnessed the tearing up of several international treaties one by one, they still believe that treaties are sometimes effective. They have always considered the planned conclusion of a military alliance by Japan, Germany, and Italy to be more serious than real bloodshed or bloodless murder and national subjugation. This attitude has been seen through by Japan. For this reason, both the extremists who are trying hard to conclude a three-nation alliance and the moderates who oppose accepting military restrictions in Japan are performing various gestures to prepare for the conclusion of an alliance, using both hard and soft tactics. For example, the recent meeting between Ambassadors Oshima and Shiratori should have been secret in nature, and its mission was at most to exchange opinions and contribute them to Tokyo. They have neither the power to decide national policy nor are they conducting diplomacy with the host country. But they strut about, brag loudly, and are afraid that people will not pay attention to them. Who is this gesture being performed for? Its intention is nothing more than the following: Intimidation of Britain. Before February, the Japanese authorities were extremely silent, while their newspapers carried out various kinds of propaganda: the authorities "will not join the German-Italian alliance." As a result, British Prime Minister Chamberlain repeatedly expressed his feelings, saying that the anti-aggression front was not concerned with the Far East. He also accepted the encirclement of the Tianjin concession and proposed negotiations in Tokyo, and a preliminary humiliating compromise was reached. Now, Britain's attitude has become slightly tougher again due to the environment, and negotiations in Tokyo have stalled. Therefore, on the one hand, the Tokyo newspapers are shouting that "if Britain does not heed Japan's demands, the conference will break down," and on the other hand, they are widely releasing the air that Japan is about to join the German-Italian military alliance, ultimately hoping to force Britain to yield to Japan's conditions. Another effect is to try to undermine the ongoing British-Soviet cooperation. Although the British-Soviet negotiations are proceeding slowly, the British and French military representatives have recently set off for Moscow to hold staff talks with the Soviet Union. This indicates that the relationship between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has made some progress. At this time, Japan suddenly indicated that it would conclude an alliance with Germany and Italy, which not only threatens Britain, but also makes France hesitant to follow Britain closely.

Whether Japan will join the German-Italian military alliance remains to be seen. Even if it does, it is not a new thing. As the British "Tough Newspaper" said, "The closer Japan cooperates with Germany and Italy, the stronger the linkage between the United States, the Soviet Union, and the democratic countries of Western Europe will be." This is what Japan is hesitant about.

### Anniversary of the Battle of Zhanggufeng Celebrated Nationwide in the Soviet Union; Commander of the Far East First Army, Stern, Publishes Commemorative Article Recalling the Battle and Praising the Consolidation of the Border Defenses

(Moscow) The Soviet people today commemorate the first anniversary of the defeat of the Japanese army in the Lake Khasan area. All newspapers have published articles about the soldiers of that battle. The editorial of Pravda stated, "On August 6th of last year, every heroic unit of the Special Red Army began a general counter-offensive against the Japanese army, which had brazenly invaded the national border. Several hours later, the Soviet national flag was proudly raised on the summit of Zhanggufeng. Subsequently, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet ordered that August 6th be designated as the memorial day of the First Special Red Army." "Today, as the commanders and political personnel of the First Red Army celebrate their victory, they are also constantly examining themselves in their growth. Within this short period of one year, the combat effectiveness of the army has increased infinitely. All its soldiers, commanders, and political instructors are always ready to inflict a fatal blow on the aggressive madmen."

Lieutenant General Stern, Commander of the First Special Red Army, wrote an article in Pravda commemorating the victory at Zhanggufeng, saying, "As the Far East Red Army celebrates the first anniversary of its victory, it will not reduce its vigilance and combat readiness in the slightest. History has repeatedly proven that the Japanese militarists, who are the actual rulers of Japan, are prone to fits of madness. Although the Japanese military representatives have repeatedly publicly admitted that the Battle of Zhanggufeng was a mistake, the Japanese generals have ultimately failed to learn from that battle. As for the blameless Red Army, because it has deep faith in its own strength, it remains calm as a mountain, waiting for the mad enemy to shatter its scales on our ramparts."

Division Commander Lyadzherov also published an article in Pravda, saying, "One year ago, a very small unit of our air force underwent a field combat test. As a result, it was proven in the Battle of Zhanggufeng that our air force officers and soldiers can complete any task on land and in the air at any time. Today, if Chairman Stalin and Commissar Voroshilov were to order the mobilization of the entire air force, any aggressor would be reduced to ashes."

(Moscow) General Stern, commander of the First Army of the Soviet Far East Red Army, who last year commanded the troops in the Battle of Zhanggufeng and achieved outstanding merits, recently wrote articles in Pravda and Red Star on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Battle of Zhanggufeng, describing the situation at that time. The content is roughly the same. He said, among other things, that in tactical maneuvers, the number of infantrymen must be three times that of the enemy when attacking, and that secret preparations should be made in advance so that the enemy cannot detect them. Then, concentrate forces to attack one point on the enemy's flank to achieve success. In the Battle of Zhanggufeng last year, although the Soviet planes and tanks were more numerous than the Japanese, the number of infantrymen was smaller, and the Japanese had a very advantageous terrain. Not only were the numbers of Soviet tanks and artillery pieces clearly visible under their observation lines, but even the number of infantrymen could not be concealed. Therefore, the Soviet side did not have the conditions for an offensive. Before the offensive, it was impossible to make secret preparations, and because of the terrain, a flanking attack was also impossible. However, "the determination of the Soviet government and people to punish the aggressors and restore them to reason" meant that the Far East Red Army did not have time to consider everything and resolutely adopted an offensive posture, ultimately relying on the soldiers and officers to fight bravely and achieve victory. "To this day, the defense of the Soviet Far East Military District is strong and unbreakable." (Havas dispatch, 6th)

(Moscow) Today is the first anniversary of the Battle of Zhanggufeng. The Soviet government decided last year that a memorial ceremony should be held annually on this day to celebrate the victory of the Red Army. A public announcement was issued today, recalling the situation at that time and mentioning the skirmishes between the Soviet and Japanese armies, as well as the fighting on the border between Outer Mongolia and "Manchukuo." Regarding this matter, observers say that neither the Soviet Union nor Japan has taken any diplomatic action. It is presumed that since the Soviet Union does not recognize "Manchukuo" and Japan does not recognize the Mongolian People's Republic, neither side will take any action to avoid the appearance of recognition. As for Japan's goal, opinions differ. According to military observers, Japan's intention is probably to cut off the land route for Soviet munitions to China. This route starts in Kulun and runs south to Bayantu. At the beginning of the conflict between the Soviet and Japanese armies, the Japanese sent planes to bomb Bayantu, which shows this. As for the roads from Kulun to China, there are two others, both to the west, beyond the reach of the "Manchukuo" planes. In addition, Japan may want to occupy the south bank of the Khalkhin River to protect its military bases in Hailar. (The distance between Hailar and the Outer Mongolian border is only about one hundred kilometers.) This is also unknown. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### Remittances from Chongqing to Shanghai Subject to a 40% Exchange Fee; No Exchange Fee for Remittances from Shanghai to the Interior; Purpose is to Prevent the Outflow of Legal Tender

(Chongqing) According to the Ministry of Finance today, remittances to Shanghai are subject to a 40% exchange fee. At the same time, the amount of remittances is limited to 100 yuan. In other words, remitting 100 yuan to Shanghai requires an exchange fee of 40 yuan. However, there is no exchange fee for remittances from Shanghai to the interior. This measure is said to be aimed at preventing the outflow of legal tender and preventing it from being obtained by the Japanese to purchase foreign exchange. According to the Ministry of Finance, the demand for legal tender in Shanghai will not be affected because the four banks, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Farmers Bank of China, hold about 10 million yuan in legal tender, which is sufficient to meet the needs of Shanghai. (Associated Press dispatch, 7th)

### British Gunboat HMS Cicala Sails from Hong Kong to Guangzhou

This is the first foreign gunboat to sail to Guangzhou after the Japanese blockade of the Pearl River half a month ago. The British warship HMS Duncan (1,400 tons) is scheduled to go to Shantou tonight. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### Danzig City Council Responds to Polish Note; Polish Border Customs Officers Ordered to Carry Weapons; Negotiations to be Conducted on the Issue of Customs Officials' Powers

(Berlin) Regarding the issue of Polish customs officials in the Free City of Danzig customs office, the semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message, stating that the Polish government's note, similar to an ultimatum, will be rejected by the Danzig City Council. It was rumored that the Danzig Customs Authority intended to prevent some Polish customs officials from performing their duties from 7:00 a.m. on the 6th of this month, but this was not the case. After hearing the rumors, the Polish High Commissioner, Chodacki, originally intended to protest by telephone in an "inopportune manner," but instead presented a note similar to an ultimatum and threatened retaliation. In fact, this rumor was completely unfounded, and the tone of the note was extremely inappropriate. The Danzig City Council believes in principle that it is not necessary to consider the deadline set by the note, nor is it possible to respond immediately. In the opinion of the Free City's responsible parties, the Polish note has provocative significance. This decision is entirely a propaganda campaign, intended to create an atmosphere of panic and prevent the City Council from maintaining its composure. However, the City Council is still able to deal with it calmly, but only to see the other party's mental exhaustion. In general, the City Council will state in its reply that Chodacki's attitude is unexpected, the Polish note is based on rumors, its tone is abnormal, and it contains threats. The City Council has no choice but to regard it as inappropriate and resolutely reject it." In addition, the City Council will conduct negotiations with Chodacki on the issue of the powers of Polish customs officials and resolve it effectively. In general, those who claim to be customs officials but whose duties are completely unrelated to customs matters will no longer be recognized. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

Danzig The Polish customs inspectors on the border with East Prussia have been ordered to carry weapons while on duty. This can be seen as a sign that Poland is determined not to be pressured to withdraw its customs officials from Danzig. At the end of the week, Poland sent a note to the Danzig City Council, stating that Poland would maintain its economic rights in Danzig by all means it deemed necessary, but Poland was very willing to conduct detailed discussions in order to resolve the matter peacefully. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

Danzig Free City The City Council Information Office recently issued a bulletin stating, "Regarding the issue of the treatment of customs officials of Polish nationality, the note presented by the Polish government is threatening. The City Council has submitted a reply to the Polish High Commissioner, Chodacki." According to the City authorities, they had previously considered recognizing those Polish customs officials who belonged to the Polish Ministry of Finance, and treating those who belonged to military organs as "border customs officials" and limiting their service. The Polish authorities then presented a strong note demanding the abolition of this distinction. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

Danzig According to HTS from reliable political sources, the leader of the Danzig National Socialist Party, Forster, will go to Berchtesgaden today to meet with Hitler and hold consultations. The content will be related to the resolution of the customs official issue. (HTS dispatch, 7th)

Danzig The Polish government previously warned the City of Danzig that Polish customs inspectors would wear uniforms and be fully armed for security reasons. This warning was realized yesterday, but it is believed that this measure may be cancelled today. The Polish diplomatic representative in Danzig, Chodacki, is scheduled to discuss and clarify this issue with the Chairman of the Danzig City Council, Greiser, on the 9th of this month. (HTS dispatch, 7th)

### Commemoration of Piłsudski's Mobilization; Poland Celebrates with Enthusiasm; 50,000 Volunteers Participate in Parade; Polish People Express True Intentions

Kraków, Poland Today marks the 25th anniversary of the mobilization of volunteers by the late Polish Minister of Military Affairs, General Piłsudski, to engage in the national restoration movement and participate in the European War. A grand ceremony was held here. 50,000 personnel from the former volunteer army, organized according to the conditions of 25 years ago, paraded for two hours and were reviewed by General Smigly-Rydz and the wife of the late Minister of Military Affairs, General Piłsudski. Foreign Minister Beck also marched with the soldiers of the First Regiment of Light Artillery, and the audience cheered. Members of veteran groups, military training groups, and patriotic groups also participated in the parade. When the crowd saw the representatives of the Port of Gdynia (near the Free City of Danzig) and the Teschen region (formerly part of Czechoslovakia, which was ceded to Poland in September of last year), they cheered enthusiastically. In addition, eight elderly veterans who participated in the Polish War of Independence in 1863 also participated in the procession in two cars. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

Warsaw Army Inspector General Smigly-Rydz and Foreign Ministry Colonel Beck, who participated in the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Polish Volunteer Army in Kraków, returned to the capital together in the evening. Newspapers here are now full of descriptions of the commemorative ceremony and publish the full text of General Smigly-Rydz's speech, all saying that Poland is united as a nation and determined to resist aggression. The government's Morning Express reported, "Foreigners who closely watched the commemorative ceremony in Kraków all know that General Smigly-Rydz's words are sufficient to express Poland's true intentions. There is no doubt how Poland will respond if someone intends to infringe on Polish interests. The people of Kraków solemnly swore that they would fight for the independence of their country in wartime until victory. We now make the same oath and are determined to fulfill it. Those who add aggression will inevitably invite disaster and collapse. It is hoped that those who dream of aggression will think deeply about it." (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### British and French Public Opinion Expresses Satisfaction

(London) The Polish Army Inspector General Smigly-Rydz's impassioned speech in Kraków yesterday, which included the words "If there is any direct or indirect attempt to harm or destroy Polish rights, Poland will resist with all its strength," has aroused a good impression in the countries of the Peace Front. However, National Socialist critics in Berlin said that this kind of speech did not make a valuable new contribution to the current situation. A German spokesman said that General Smigly-Rydz spoke of Poland's lack of aggressive intentions, but the spirit of calling for war that is now present in Poland and abroad seems to want to open war with Germany. French countries consider the Polish Army Inspector General's speech to be a clear warning to Germany. Le Temps reported that this shows that Poland is unwilling to back down. If Germany launches an aggression, Warsaw will immediately make a military response. People in London are very interested in this speech. According to Reuters, official circles believe that it is completely in line with Poland's consistent policy, because Poland has never made a showy expression, and its policy has always been very clear and reasonable. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

(Paris) The Polish Army Inspector General Smigly-Rydz's powerful speech in Kraków yesterday has been unanimously praised by newspapers here. Among them, the right-wing Le Temps cited this speech to explain the current situation, saying, "The Versailles Treaty's privileges granted to Poland regarding the Free City of Danzig, the country is determined to maintain, even if it means going to war. This can be seen in General Smigly-Rydz's words. As for the mutual assistance agreements established between that country and Britain and France, Britain and France, as well as the opinions of other countries, all agree. Tracing back to March 15 of this year, the world knows that if the countries concerned allow German leader Hitler to launch an aggression, or at least allow him to threaten with aggression, then no group will be able to stop it. Germany's goal is to destroy Poland, just as it destroyed Czechoslovakia. The dispute over the Free City of Danzig is not economic in nature, nor is it ethnic in nature. The crux of the matter is whether the German dictator can dominate Europe alone." (Havas dispatch, 7th)

(Paris) Newspapers here have praised the speech given by the Polish Army Inspector General Smigly-Rydz in Kraków. Le Jour wrote, "Poland has fully expressed its spirit of endurance in recent weeks, which is admirable. Now the country's highest military leader, who is also the heir to the late Minister of Military Affairs Piłsudski, has now informed European countries that Poland's endurance also has its limits. The tone is firm and no different from practical action. It can be seen that Poland will never succumb to violence. If Germany takes aggressive action, Poland will immediately respond militarily. Negotiations of all kinds, with the aim of ceding the Free City of Danzig to Germany, are not acceptable to Poland." Le Paris-Soir wrote, "General Smigly-Rydz's speech was impassioned and did not lose the spirit of a soldier, and its tone was firm and did not need to be commented on. Whether reading the original text or translating it into German, there is no ambiguity." (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### German Newspapers Reveal Resentful Mood

(Berlin) Newspapers here have commented on the speech given by the Polish Army Inspector General Smigly-Rydz with words of indignation, which can be seen in the titles used. The Monday Report's headline said, "The saying that the City of Danzig is the economic lifeline of Poland can be described as a ridiculous joke." The Monday Post's headline: "General Smigly-Rydz's platitudes." In addition, the semi-official German News Agency issued a message stating that Piłsudski's followers are now celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Polish rebellion, but the Polish government is not following Piłsudski's policy. (Havas dispatch, 6th)

### Britain, France, and Turkey Agree on Military Agreement; Emphasis on the Defense of Thessaloniki

(London) After the establishment of a mutual assistance agreement between Turkey and Britain and France, talks are now continuing to agree on a military agreement to complement the mutual assistance agreement. Regarding this, what the Turkish government values most is the issue of the defense of the Greek city of Thessaloniki. According to sources familiar with the matter, a certain important Italian figure once told a diplomat from a certain country that once a war breaks out in Europe, Italy will try to occupy Thessaloniki. At this time, Italy is already making various military preparations within Albania, such as concentrating a large number of troops and mechanized units and air force, and building strategic highways to the Greek border. All of this is sufficient to prove that Italy is indeed planning to attack Greece after the outbreak of the war. Its goal is nothing more than to isolate Greece from its ally Turkey. If this is achieved, the strategic situation of Turkey and its allies in the Aegean Sea and the Balkans will inevitably be greatly affected. Following this evolution, Italy will be able to collude with Bulgaria to coerce Yugoslavia and Romania. Therefore, we should plan ahead and take appropriate precautions. Turkey has concentrated a large number of troops in the Adalar region (located at the junction of Turkey, Bulgaria, and Greece), said to number as many as 200,000, in order to be able to deploy them in the event of an emergency. According to British military sources, General Heringer, commander of the French forces in the Near East (who led the French delegation to conduct talks with the Turkish military authorities), recently came to London and has also discussed the issue of jointly defending the Thessaloniki region with the British military authorities.

### British War Secretary Visits Paris

(Paris) Regarding the sudden visit of British War Secretary Hore-Belisha to Paris while Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet are not in Paris, political figures here speculate that it is to explain to the French responsible authorities the agreement reached in London before the British and French military delegations went to Moscow. (HTS dispatch, 7th)

### Bulgarian Congressmen Tour the Soviet Union

(Moscow) Twenty-five members of the Bulgarian Congress, forming a delegation led by Deputy Speaker Markov, visited the Soviet Union and took the opportunity to visit the Agricultural Exhibition and various important agricultural regions. They arrived here today. Bagov, Director of the Liaison Department of the Soviet Foreign Affairs People's Committee, and Gorkin, Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee, greeted them at the station. Among the Bulgarian delegation are many important figures, such as House Budget Committee Chairman Gusev, who is the brother of Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Gusev, and Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Koviturov. (Havas dispatch, 7th)

### Göring Speech Criticizes Britain

(Berlin) German Aviation Minister General Göring said in a speech in Thasos today that Germany's eager and united determination will not allow another Versailles Treaty to appear. In the future, we will never allow any of our important interests to be opposed. Threats and inducements cannot move us. We do not want war. We are actively preparing for military equipment, but this is only for our own survival if we are forced to fight. Britain is eager to repeat the comedy of 1914, intending to make Germany accept a peace treaty that is worse than the Treaty of Versailles. It must be known that the current situation is fundamentally different from the past. Today, we are full of eager and united determination and will never allow another Versailles Treaty to reappear in the future. We do not threaten Britain, but if Britain thinks it can stop Germany's progress in all parts of the world, then Britain must bear the responsibility for disturbing the peace. The threat of blockading and starving Germany must not be allowed to happen a second time, because the German Air Force will pay attention to this and because Germany has now stored a lot of food. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)

### Third Phase of Italian Military Exercises; 150,000 People Participate

(Rome) The third phase of the Italian military exercises, which will determine the outcome, began yesterday. The mechanized units of the Po River Defense Force first came into contact with the attacking army from the French border. The large number of German journalists and other observers who came here to watch the exercise has attracted general attention. It is believed that Berlin is eagerly awaiting responsible reports on the effectiveness of the Italian army and the practical value of the Italian army's theory of rapid decision. Among the military leaders who came here to watch the exercise were German Chief of Staff Halder and Hungarian Chief of Staff Weitzer. The exercise area covers 220 miles in length and 45 miles in width, and the participating troops include 150,000 people and air force units. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)

### German Military Authorities Requisition Cars

### US Treasury Secretary Travels from England to Denmark

Southampton, England US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, who came to Europe for a tour on the French mail ship Normandie from New York, has arrived here and told reporters, "This is purely a private holiday trip. At 4:00 this afternoon, I will take a boat from Harwich Harbour in Essex to Denmark for a tour. It can be seen that I have no public duties in London, and today is a bank holiday, so people in the banking community cannot meet. This trip is scheduled to return home on the original ship on the sixth of next month." (Havas dispatch, 7th)

### Spanish Restoration Movement Encounters Obstacles; Deposed King Alfonso Unwilling to Be a Puppet; Duke of Maura and Franco Break Off Negotiations

(Paris) The right-wing "Action Française" newspaper recently reported that Duke of Maura of Spain, one of the leaders of the Spanish monarchist faction, had been residing in Estoril, Portugal, since the Spanish Civil War. He recently flew to Santoña, Spain, and then traveled by car to Burgos to meet with General Franco, the head of the Spanish state. The two had been apart for three years and were delighted to see each other again. Also present were Interior Minister Suñer, Foreign Minister Jordana, and a member of the German Embassy. General Franco reportedly told Duke Maura that he welcomed the restoration of deposed King Alfonso XIII, but asked that he recognize the Falangist Spanish Traditionalist Phalanx and of the JONS as the supreme authority. Duke Maura immediately replied that the royal prerogative, including the power to convene and dissolve parliament, was a privilege inherited through generations, and Alfonso XIII was unwilling to relinquish it. He would only return to govern after a national referendum expressing support, but would not accept any conditions. Foreign Minister Jordana then tried to reconcile the two sides, suggesting that Alfonso XIII abdicate and his son, Prince Juan, ascend the throne. Duke Maura responded that Prince Juan was also determined to maintain the royal prerogative, which was inconsistent with Alfonso XIII's initial stance. The next day, General Franco issued an order declaring himself the head of state, responsible only to God and history. (Havas, 7th)

### Japanese Naval Military Discusses European Policy; Five-Minister Conference to Be Held Today; Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in Sees the Emperor; Anglo-Japanese Talks to Resume Today

(Tokyo) At 3:00 PM today, Minister of the Army Itagaki visited Minister of the Navy Yonai to explain the army's policy regarding the new situation in Europe, and the results of his discussion with Prime Minister Hiranuma last night. The two ministers exchanged views for two and a half hours. After Itagaki left, he immediately convened an emergency meeting of army administrative staff to report on the details of the talks with the Navy Minister. Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in visited the Emperor in Hayama this morning to report on various matters. (Reuters, 7th)

(Tokyo) The British government's response regarding the Anglo-Japanese talks arrived at the British Embassy on the evening of the 7th. However, the Embassy stated that it had not yet received the final views from its home country. Ambassador Craigie, who is currently recuperating in Hakone, will return to Tokyo on the morning of the 8th. If the British response has arrived, the seventh round of negotiations will be held on the afternoon of the 8th. If the British side still does not make any announcements on the afternoon of the 8th, the Japanese side will consider Britain's delay to be inappropriate. (Domei, 7th)

(London) Authoritative sources announced last night that a partial resolution of the Tianjin case could be achieved as a result of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo. The agreement to be signed between Britain and Japan includes the following four points: (1) British concession authorities will cooperate with the Japanese army to crack down on anti-Japanese activities within the concession. (2) The issue of transferring the four suspects in the Cheng Xigeng case will not be resolved in the agreement unless the Japanese side can provide new evidence of their guilt. (3) A Japanese national will be appointed as an advisor to the Tianjin British Concession's Municipal Council. (4) Anti-Japanese propaganda will be controlled and the Communist Party will be suppressed. The British government has not yet sent new instructions to Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan. The cabinet is still considering the ambassador's final report. (Associated Press, 7th)

(Tokyo) Before the emergency Five-Minister Conference is held on the 8th, the army authorities held a headquarters meeting at the Army Minister's residence at 10:00 AM on the 7th. Those present included Army Minister Itagaki, Decision Officer Yamawaki, Military Affairs Bureau Chief Machijiri, Military Affairs Section Chief Arisue, and Military Affairs Section Chief Iwakuro. Based on the decision of the three bureau chiefs' meeting on the 3rd of this month, they discussed specific measures for the army's policy to cope with tomorrow's Five-Minister Conference until noon. Later, Deputy Chief of Staff Nakajima, and Chiefs of various Bureaus including Kawahara, Hashimoto, and Kiwaguchi, and Colonel Tatsumi from the General Staff participated and the joint discussion continued in the afternoon. (Domei, 7th)

(Tokyo) In view of the recent developments in the international situation, and because Minister of the Army Itagaki expressed his hope on July 18, the government authorities decided to hold an emergency Five-Minister Conference after the regular cabinet meeting on the 8th to conduct important discussions in order to realize this hope. In addition, Minister of the Army Itagaki visited Prime Minister Hiranuma last night to report on the opinions on measures to cope with the European situation decided by the Army's Three Bureau Chiefs meeting on the 3rd of this month. The Prime Minister replied that he fully understood the intentions of the military authorities. (Domei, 7th)

(Tokyo) The spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated today during a reception for journalists that no reports had been received here regarding the meeting between Ambassador Oshima to Germany and Ambassador Shiratori to Italy on August 3 in Como to discuss Japan's participation in the German-Italian military alliance. He declined to comment on news reports of close cooperation between Japan and the Axis powers and was also unwilling to disclose the details of the German-Italian-Japanese negotiations. (Reuters, 7th)

(Tokyo) The British government's instructions to Ambassador Craigie, which will determine the success of the Tokyo Conference, still had not arrived on the 7th. Therefore, the seventh round of talks could not be held today. The Japanese side is continuing to seriously monitor Britain's attitude and adopt a waiting posture. Major Miyamoto, the local representative of the army, contacted the foreign affairs authorities by telephone this morning and it seems that they have reached a consensus. They have decided to wait another day, the 8th. If there is still no certainty about holding the conference, it will be considered necessary for the Japanese side to take any effective and appropriate measures. (Domei, 7th)

(Tokyo) Neither the round table conference nor the subcommittees met today, presumably because the London instructions had not yet arrived. Japanese newspapers declared that if Britain does not heed Japan's demands, the conference will break down. However, if it acknowledges Japan's demands, a compromise can be quickly reached. It was also stated that if there is an improper delay in the London instructions, the Japanese government will have to make a major decision to cope with the situation. (Reuters, 7th)

### British, French, and Soviet Staff Talks May Conclude by the End of September

(Paris) According to the "Paris Midi" newspaper, the staff talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union may not conclude until the end of September at the earliest due to the complexity of the issues under discussion. The newspaper continued that Poland and Romania will also send representatives to participate in the talks to discuss the cooperation between the two countries and the military alliance of the three countries. (Haitong, 7th)

(London) The "Daily Telegraph" published a report from its Moscow correspondent discussing the current state of the Moscow negotiations in detail. According to the report, the Soviet Union requires sufficient guarantees regarding the security of the Baltic states, including protection even from the indirect risk of attack. The correspondent believes that the naval conference will inevitably recommend naval cooperation between the Black Sea and Baltic Sea fleets. The Soviet Union has no need to worry about this. The correspondent also explained in detail the differences in attitude and diplomatic customs between Britain and the Soviet Union. The British only need to stipulate the basic principles for the alliance agreement and can be general. If the two sides cannot trust each other on basic principles, what else is there to discuss in detail? (Haitong, 7th)

(Paris) Regarding the current stage of the Moscow negotiations, the "Paris Midi" newspaper published an article commenting that the Soviet government insists that all political and military negotiations must include the Far East. Moscow believes that the Anglo-Japanese conflict in Tianjin proves that Western European countries must cooperate with the Soviet Union in the Far East, and that the attitude adopted by the United States towards Japan is helpful for this cooperation. (Haitong, 7th)

### Singapore Greatly Increases Defense Forces

The troops stationed in Singapore are extremely active today. Although the government side claims it is preparing for the usual weekly holiday, reliable sources say that more troops will arrive here from India tomorrow. The army coming from India will have at least 8,000 men to strengthen the defenses here. At the same time, two squadrons of bombers stationed in India, namely the Bristol Squadron and the Blenheim Squadron, are scheduled to arrive here tonight. Other air force squadrons may also arrive here in a short period of time. (Associated Press, 7th)

### Sakhalin-Urai Petroleum Co. Signs New Contract with Soviet Union; Wages Increased by 15%; Expires at the End of November This Year

(Moscow) The labor contract signed by the Sakhalin-Urai Petroleum Co. with the Soviet Trade Union expired on December 5 last year. Negotiations for a new contract were continued, but the issue of wage increases was delayed. The workers have been on strike until today, when representatives of the petroleum company and the Soviet trade union agreed on the outline of the new contract. However, the details will not be finalized until the end of this month, when the contract can be signed. It is said that the main points of the new contract stipulate (1) a 15% increase in wages for Soviet workers, starting from the date of expiration of the old contract on December 5 last year, and (2) all Soviet workers should return to work before the end of this month, and wages will be paid for the strike period. (3) The new contract will take effect from December last year and will expire at the end of November this year. The general public is commenting that the climate on Sakhalin Island is cold and the mining of each oil field must stop between September and October, and the effective period of the new contract will expire at the end of November this year. It can be seen that this solution is still difficult to sustain. (Havas, 7th)

(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry announced today that the news report that the Sakhalin Petroleum Company and representatives of the Far East Soviet Trade Union had agreed on a labor contract has been confirmed by official reports received in Tokyo. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" commented on this matter, saying that it is not appropriate to be too optimistic. The working season on Northern Sakhalin Island begins in June. Although those who have the right to extract oil have applied to the Soviet authorities to recruit 870 Japanese workers and 2,050 Soviet workers, no workers have been working to date. Although the contract established in Moscow can solve the problem of recruiting workers, half of the working period has passed, and the problems of food, fuel, and medical supplies are still pending. Therefore, it is too early to be optimistic about the future of Japanese oil and coal mining on Northern Sakhalin Island at present. (Reuters, 7th)

### Australian Federal Prime Minister Issues Statement; If Britain Joins the War, the Federation Will Act in Unison

The "Melbourne German Essen National Newspaper" (known as the organ of the country's Aviation Minister Göring) recently published that if war breaks out in Europe, the Australian Federation will remain neutral. Federal Minister of the Interior Hughes has issued a statement to correct this, saying that "if Britain is drawn into war because of the implementation of its current policies, then the Australian Federation will definitely act in unison with it."

### British Mail Plane Arrives in New York

(New York) The British Imperial Airways aircraft "Calypso" arrived here at 9:27 AM today. The inaugural flight of the air mail service across the Atlantic, departing from Southampton, England, has been completed. The captain of the aircraft, Rogers, said that the flight from Foynes, Ireland, to Botwood, Newfoundland, was quite difficult because it had to fly against the wind and the wind was very strong. The journey took 19 and a half hours, with an average speed of 89.5 knots per hour. They flew blind in heavy rain for nine hours and encountered fog for seven and a half hours. The journey of any aircraft crossing the Atlantic may be considered the longest. The Calypso carried 1,500 pounds of mail and arrived here via Foynes, Botwood, and Montreal. The "Calypso" and "Cavalier" aircraft will carry mail back and forth across the Atlantic every week until the end of September. (Reuters, 7th)

### Britain Holds Air Defense Exercises

(London) 1,300 British military aircraft are scheduled to conduct large-scale air defense exercises in the south from 8:00 AM tomorrow to 7:00 PM on the 10th. The scope is far greater than in the past. Among the aircraft participating in the exercise, 800 will be the "defenders," concentrated in Worcestershire and the Hampshire coast. The remaining 500 aircraft will form the "attackers," or the so-called "enemy." In addition, 50 reconnaissance aircraft will be dispatched to report on the exercise results at any time. The "enemy aircraft" will attempt to bomb various parts of the south, so that the efficiency of the anti-aircraft artillery can be tested in practice. In general, the period from midnight on the 9th of this month to dawn on the 10th will be the most exciting time for the air force exercises. All of London and 26 counties in southeastern England will implement a blackout. (Havas, 6th)

### Hungary's Restoration 20th Anniversary

### France Exploits Oil Fields in Border Areas

(Paris) French Minister of Public Works Monzi went to Saint-Gaudens near the Pyrenees yesterday to inspect the oil exploitation project. According to 20 years of scientific investigation results, the oil reserves there are extremely rich. The well has now reached a depth of 1,520 meters. Once the latest equipment arrives from the United States in January next year, it is expected to be able to extract petroleum. It is said that the reason why the French government is actively exploiting oil is because the country needs 5 million tons every year, while the country only produces 100,000 tons. (Haitong News Agency, 7th)

### Siamese Government Arrests Overseas Chinese En Masse

(Chongqing) Siam's attitude towards China has recently changed suddenly. According to reliable information from the Siamese side on July 28, the Siamese government has been arresting Chinese national salvation activists for days. Kuomintang members Liang Weicheng and Chen Wentian have also been arrested. More than 20 Chinese schools were investigated this month, and the two banks of overseas Chinese were searched because receipts for national salvation donations were found, and their managers and deputy managers were detained. The situation is serious and the overseas Chinese community is panic-stricken. (7th Telegram)

### It Is Difficult to Confirm Siam's Participation in the Anti-Communist Pact

(London) According to rumors, Siam has already joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. Sources close to the Foreign Ministry have recently declared that this statement has not been officially confirmed. Even well-informed people are unwilling to express any opinion without official confirmation. They only said that Japan has indeed been actively wooing Siam recently, but according to recent news, the Siamese government is prudent in all matters and may not be willing to share its fate with Japan.

### American Aviators, the Maddy Brothers, Set Endurance Flight Record; Flying for a Total of 343 Hours and 46 Minutes

The American aviators, the Maddy brothers, of Springfield, Illinois, USA, have been making endurance flights in a light aircraft since the 2nd of this month, for a period of five days, saying that they would not land until the engine stopped working. Unexpectedly, when flying to Japan in the morning, they suddenly encountered a rainstorm, and its engine, estimated to have 55 horsepower, could not withstand it.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Yichang; Bombs Fall on Areas Concentrated with British Nationals; Two Jardine Matheson Ships Destroyed; Significant Damage to British Commercial Property

The English-language "North China Daily News" reports that Japanese military aircraft bombed Yichang twice yesterday (the 6th) within a six-hour period, deliberately dropping bombs on one of the areas concentrated with British nationals, destroying Jardine Matheson's "Kiawo" and "Shunchang" ships, and Jardine Engineering Corporation’s riverside property. One bomb fell 30 feet from the "Shunchang" ship, injuring British staff member Mr. Duer's arm. Two Chinese sailors died and three were injured. British naval authorities had notified the Japanese side in advance that the area was a concentrated area for foreign women and children, and reported the movements of all British ships to the Japanese naval authorities on a daily basis. Each of the British ships was painted with the Union Jack to clearly indicate them. All of these facts suggest that the attack was a deliberate bombing of British nationals and property. Yesterday's attack was the third in the past few months. Under similar circumstances, Japanese aircraft bombed Jardine Matheson ships in Zhenjiang last December and in Wuhu this March. According to telegrams received by Jardine Matheson, the first attack occurred at 5:00 AM in the morning. Twelve Japanese aircraft dropped bombs on the Asiatic Petroleum Company's oil depot. The site was about two and a half miles from the Socony-Vacuum Oil Company. One bomb fell into the water 30 feet from the "Shunchang" ship, injuring Mr. Duer's arm, killing two Chinese sailors and injuring three others. The "Kiawo" ship, berthed next to the Jardine Matheson wharf, was hit by several bombs within 100 feet, but was not damaged. However, Jardine Engineering Corporation’s riverside property was severely damaged in the air raid. In the second air raid at 11:00 AM in the morning, Japanese bombers flew very low without resistance, dropping incendiary bombs on the "Kiawo" and "Shunchang" ships (both weighing 2,000 tons) berthed next to the Asiatic Petroleum Company. The two ships immediately caught fire and were completely burned above the waterline. The British warship "HMS Gnat" was berthed near the bombed area and was fortunately not hit, but quickly sailed to put out the fire. The fire was brought under control at around 1:30 PM. Although the two ships were severely burned, they remained afloat. There were no further deaths or injuries from the fire. The "Kiawo" ship was a major ship on the river and had been rented by the British government several times. In addition to bombing the riverside property and ships, Japanese aircraft dropped many bombs in the city, starting fires in many places. The exact details of the damage are not clear this morning (the 7th).

### Chaotic Scenes in Shantou; Japanese Army Promotes Anti-British Propaganda; British Consul Humiliated

Shantou Dispatch: The Japanese army along the coast has recently been engaged in guerrilla warfare. This is actually a strategy of feinting in one direction while attacking in another, selecting key transportation points along the coast and launching surprise attacks to occupy them with a small number of troops, and then moving on to other plans. The purpose is to use the convenience of fleet transportation to tie down the main force of the Chinese army in one corner with a small number of troops, creating a stalemate. In the Chaojie area, the two armies have now entered a stalemate. The Japanese army suddenly shifted to Shanwei and suffered a setback when invading Shanwei on the 20th. They then disturbed Daya Bay, Aotou, Hengmen of Zhongshan County, Furong Mountain, and Boliwei. Recently, they concentrated their fleet in Daya Bay and disturbed Dangshi. This is nothing more than using a trick of roving attacks to confuse the Chinese army and cause repeated disturbances.

Due to the blockage of ships on the Han River, Shantou's urban area is isolated from the various counties. Charcoal, rice, cooking oil, salt, vegetables, meat, eggs, and everything else are lacking. The Japanese army relies entirely on canned food shipped from Taiwan for supplies. The civilians who have not fled are like prisoners in a cage. The electric lights were completely destroyed and the water tower and main pipes of the waterworks were completely destroyed. The civilians relied entirely on coolies and opium addicts to fetch water from the river at the train station. Last month, each load cost four jiao in silver dollars, but now it costs more than one dollar, because the opium addicts and ruffians have mostly become counterfeit and no longer work as water carriers. Moreover, the river water is extremely unclean, because the riverbank is piled with corpses and no one is burying them, causing epidemics among residents who drink the water. Doctors and medicines are both lacking. Even after death, there are no coffins for burial. The Japanese army does not allow people to do good deeds or provide relief. The situation is extremely miserable.

After the Japanese side pulled out Chen Juemin to serve as the head of the puppet local maintenance association, they recently promoted the establishment of a fake Huichaojia government. A certain newspaper's printing press has been seized by the Japanese army and renamed "Yuedong Bao" to promote anti-British sentiment. The Shantou Post Office was forced to resume operations, but there were no ships to transport goods in or out, so no mail arrived in Shantou. As for newspapers and magazines, except for those given to foreigners, all were confiscated and detained by the Japanese army. Foreigners' letters were also opened and inspected. After the French Consul Carvoun protested, letters received by foreign consuls were sent as usual. The Japanese Navy restricted British ships to one per week to enter Shantou, only allowing them to load mail and not allowing passengers or cargo to land. Each time a British ship entered the port, it had to report to the Japanese commander 24 hours in advance. The British Consul stationed in Shantou was pushed to the ground by a Japanese sentry. The British Consul's secretariat was forcibly occupied by the Japanese army. The residence of the Customs Tax Officer (a British national) in Jiaoshi was also occupied. A British employee of Brunner Mond & Co. was slapped. The British side has not protested. As for the telephone bureau, it was fortunately preserved because of American business capital. American-owned firms, churches, and other buildings were initially occupied by the Japanese army, but they voluntarily withdrew after American sailors arrived to protect them.

The great fire in Chao'an City lasted for four days. More than 2,000 Japanese troops were stationed in Zhugaoshan, Bijia Mountain, Hulushan, Jinshan, and other places outside the city. The Japanese military command post was located at the County Middle School and the Yingzhou Hotel. The Fujita and Iijima units of the Japanese army in Shantou have now been secretly transferred elsewhere and replaced by 150 men from Li Daoxuan's fake advance team, who are being monitored by 80 military police. Shantou is no longer a world city.

### Dinghai After the Robbery: The Market is Extremely Desolate

Dinghai Correspondence: More than a month has passed since Dinghai fell. Although most of the major stores were forced to reopen, because residents dare not go out to shop, the doors are deserted, and business is very sluggish. Also, most residents, although they have returned to the city, are afraid of the rampant Japanese army, so they live in seclusion and rarely go out. Young women and men have disappeared from the streets. Slightly more courageous elderly people only walk in the middle of the day. Once evening arrives, they all go home. As for the Japanese army, they fear attacks by Chinese guerrillas, so they station troops everywhere to stand guard. At each city gate, six or seven people are stationed. In the evening, the city gates are tightly closed, and by 8 p.m., a curfew is enforced, so the market is extremely desolate.

Recently, the Japanese army has opened gambling dens, brothels, and opium dens everywhere in the city. Residents must salute whenever they encounter Japanese soldiers on guard. However, farmers in the countryside are often beaten because their saluting posture is incorrect, while those who salute correctly are falsely accused of being intellectuals or military personnel and are subjected to severe torture. Therefore, the people cannot bear the suffering. Recently, the Japanese army demanded 30 beautiful women from the puppet autonomous committee, but they did not want local prostitutes or other women, so the group of ugly officials in the committee felt very embarrassed. Ten young teachers have been killed. The remaining puppet autonomous committee recently published a newspaper called "Zhoushan Xinbao" (New Zhoushan Daily), the content of which is extremely absurd, and there are very few readers.

### The Japanese Puppets Impose Harsh Taxes and Establish a Puppet Customs Bureau

Yangzhou Correspondence: The Nanjing puppet Ministry of Industry recently established the Lianghuai Salt Affairs Administration in Yangzhou. The puppet director of the Huainan district is Wu Benyue, and the puppet director of the Huaibei district is Yang Furen, along with a Japanese named Kato Ken. After the establishment of this bureau, the official salt warehouse was closed, and harsh taxes were imposed. Every dan (unit of weight) of salt transported into Yangzhou city is subject to a tax of five yuan. Salt shops that obtain a license to sell are charged three yuan and six jiao. Ordinary merchants are reluctant to proceed. Recently, the puppet director Wu Bentie also investigated the sales volume and vat openings of salt basins and soy sauce gardens, intending to actively promote official sales.

### Chinese Army Attacks Tongli, Puppet Police Retreat in Disarray

Wujiang Correspondence: Tongli Town is surrounded by lakes, making its situation excellent. A small number of Japanese troops are stationed in the town, colluding with the Wujiang puppet "Police First Squadron" to extort donations and search wantonly. A few days ago, guerrillas from the Shuangmiaogang Qingshuiyang area suddenly attacked the town, engaging in battle with the puppet "police force" at Ye Zehu Shuangmiaogang. The puppet police fled to the Shitou Tan area of Nandao. The Dong Zhongjia Bang in Tunhu Village was occupied by the guerrillas. The Japanese puppet army launched a large-scale rescue operation, opening fire near Tunhu Village. After several hours of fighting, the Japanese puppet forces were defeated and retreated.

### Travelogue of the Southwest (Continued)

3.  Passing Through Hanoi

In addition to making Hanoi a political center (the Governor-General's residence), the French government also wants to make it a transportation center. Therefore, on the map, the railway networks south to Saigon, east to Haiphong, northwest to Kunming, and northeast to Lang Son and Dong Dang all have Hanoi as their core. However, except for the first route to Saigon, which indeed departs from Hanoi, the other routes actually converge at Gia Lam, more than 20 li east of Hanoi. From Gia Lam to Hanoi is only a section that encompasses the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and its branch lines. We entered and exited this section twice from Haiphong to Lang Son, which was really uneconomical in terms of time.

To complete the journey between Haiphong and Lang Son in one day, one must depart in the morning. The first slow train from Haiphong (fast trains cannot carry much luggage) took us on our journey. The ride was extremely bumpy, and the noise was deafening. This was probably due to the lightness of the rails or the speed of the train. The train stopped at every station along the way. When it stopped, large numbers of Annamese people got on and off. Regardless of how crowded the carriages were, they always carried entire loads of things onto the train. Some even carried their entire household possessions onto the train, leaving no room to even sit down. We saw a person carrying a load of goldfish, using all their strength to barely manage half of the load, but the train started mercilessly. The remaining half of the load was hanging outside, and one by one, the jars and pots on top were thrown out of the train due to centrifugal force. Finally, when the train stopped at the next station, only a few dried-up goldfish remained.

When the train arrived at Gia Lam, there was a 15-minute stop. Passengers going to Kunming got off here. On the platform next to it, a train from Hanoi on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was waiting. This hurried transfer was very tense. Five minutes after leaving Gia Lam, the train crossed the bridge built on the Fulang River (Red River). This is the longest railway bridge in the Far East, with a total length of two and a half kilometers. The train travels at a speed of 15 kilometers per hour, taking ten minutes to complete the entire journey. The Fulang River originates in Yunnan, China, and is called the Yuan River. After entering Annam, it carries a lot of mud and sand, and the water turns red, so it is commonly known as the Red River. The current is very rapid, and there are whirlpools everywhere in Hanoi. Small boats travel along the edge of the whirlpools. If one is not careful, there is a danger of capsizing. There is a large sandbar in the middle of the river where the bridge is built, dividing the river into two branches, so when the train crosses, it seems like it is crossing two river surfaces. The western end of the bridge is the Hanoi branch station, and the Hanoi main station is further beyond.

There is a train from Hanoi to Lang Son and Dong Dang in the early morning and at noon. The first train from Haiphong to Hanoi can connect with the train to Dong Dang that departs at noon, with a three-hour break in between, which can be used for a short tour of the city. The train departs from Hanoi, passes through Gia Lam, and then turns northeast. The entire journey is 162 kilometers. The first half is a plain, and the second half is entirely mountainous. The train travels around the mountains, winding and turning, and the scenery is quite beautiful. There are many forks in the road above Lang Gia, so a locomotive is added at the rear to cooperate with pushing and pulling. In the evening, we arrived at Lang Son, got off the train, and stayed overnight, because the market in Dong Dang is relatively poor, and food and lodging are not very convenient. Many people who work in Dong Dang still stay in Lang Son overnight, and the bus to Longzhou also departs from Lang Son, so staying in Lang Son is more appropriate.

4. Dong Dang, the Border Between China and Vietnam

The railway between Lang Son and Dong Dang was built not long ago. Passing through Dong Dang is the Pingxiang County (Zhennanguan) of Guangxi, China. Those who handle cargo transportation have specialized personnel stationed here. From Lang Son to Dong Dang, the distance is 14 kilometers. In addition to the train, there is a fixed bus service every day. The bus on the Langlong Road also passes through here. Passports for entry and exit are verified here. The verification office was originally near the customs, but it has now been moved to the border gate. After getting off the train, you have to walk a distance. Cars can go directly. When leaving Annam, the customs is more casual. Except for large quantities of goods, ordinary luggage can be exempt from inspection, but checking passports and signatures can sometimes be quite troublesome. You may have to wait an hour or two. At the same time, there are many Annamese public officials who greet you with smiling faces, asking if you have submitted your passport or if you want them to expedite the process, etc. These people are all trying to earn some change, but do not hire them, because the extent to which they can actually help is minimal. If you give one of them money, they will communicate with each other and swarm you, creating all sorts of trouble. Once the passport is verified, the exit procedure is complete. You can pass through a gate made of iron chains. From this gate to the Chinese border, there are still four kilometers, but there are no more obstacles.

There are two routes from Dong Dang to Gui. One is to take the Langlong Road bus to Longzhou (one round trip per day). The entire journey is 19 kilometers, and if there are no problems with passport verification and the customs at the pass in Dong Dang, it can be reached in three hours. If you need to go to Nanning, you can take the Longyong Road bus the next day. The 249-kilometer journey takes eight hours. If you depart from Lang Son or Dong Dang and want to reach Nanning in one day, you can only hire a car. Then, the 270-kilometer journey can be completed in about nine hours.

5. From Zhennanguan to Nanning

Four kilometers after the car leaves Dong Dang, you can see a wooden sign with white characters on a blue background that reads "Keep to the Left Here." This is the boundary stone between China and Vietnam. The driver must change his habit of driving on the right in Annam and switch to driving on the left. A short distance from here stands the magnificent Zhennanguan.

On both sides of the Zhennanguan gate, we saw various slogans for the first time, and we felt a sense of intimacy. In particular, the national flag fluttering in the wind on top of the gate tower reflected a bright color in the lush green mountains. The turret is the dormitory for the watchmen, and a sentry is watching the inside and outside of the gate with all his attention to prevent the intrusion of criminals. After the car passes through here, you must go to the Border Defense Commissioner's Office to submit your passport for signature and inspection before you can enter the gate. (To be continued)

### Speculative Manipulation Continues Unabated, Financial Markets Still Chaotic Yesterday, Foreign Exchange Shrinks, Gold Rises, Public Bonds Fall, Various Rumors Proved False

The Shanghai financial market has experienced fluctuations since last Saturday due to the creation of rumors by speculators seeking to manipulate and profit from the market. Although facts have proven the rumors to be unfounded, and the Chinese government's determination to stabilize the currency system has not changed, rumors about preparing for currency inflation in the occupied areas of Shanghai are absolutely untrue. As a result, rumors in the financial market have gradually subsided since yesterday, but speculators continue to exploit foreign exchange and gold markets with their manipulative skills, causing the financial market to remain chaotic yesterday. For example, the black market for foreign exchange continued to tighten.

The HSBC exchange rate remained unchanged, but the actual market rate for British pounds was four shillings and 0.625 pence, and the US dollar was seven yuan and 93.75 fen. The black market for gold closed at 3,840 yuan in the morning and 3,960 yuan in the afternoon.

The black market for securities continued to decline, with grades A, B, C, D, and E falling by 0.5 to 0.75 yuan each. The exchange discount stood between 195 yuan and 205 yuan. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the Chinese government is making every effort to

Maintain the value and stability of the legal tender. Within areas directly controlled by the government, no problems have occurred. However, the occupied areas, especially Shanghai, face a distorted situation. The root cause lies in the mischief of villains and the fueling of speculators. As for the legal tender itself, its foundation remains sound, and it can maintain its stability even in turbulent waters.

### Shanghai's Abnormal Development is Declining, French Newspaper Predicts Collapse in Six Months

According to the French newspaper "Beijing Political News," Shanghai: Since the beginning of 1938, a very unusual artificial boom has occurred, and the reason is that refugees from various places have gathered, all bringing some savings to spend in Shanghai, and this extraordinary boom has arisen. It is said that these savings are mostly invested in various small industries, but recently,

Due to the continuous rise in prices, it is very difficult for these small industries to develop. According to general observations, sooner or later, these refugees' savings will be exhausted, and they will have to relocate to places with lower living costs to spend their remaining years. However, residents in the concession are already deeply aware of the

Pain of not being able to make ends meet. If a mass return movement breaks out, it will be unstoppable. The current congestion in the concession will inevitably have a huge reaction. According to general economic predictions, in six months, the houses in the concession, which are now fully rented, will have

The suffering of empty houses with no one living in them. If such a phenomenon is discovered at that time, those who remain in Shanghai will feel some comfort, but this may only be a small minority. At that time, the abnormal boom will also come to an end.

### Chinese Army Commando Units Have Opened the Sujia Road, Guerrillas Engage Japanese in Kunshan, Situation Tense on Hongqiao Road in Western Shanghai

According to visitors from Kunshan, yesterday, a Chinese army guerrilla force of more than one hundred people encountered Japanese troops at Tianfu'an, 30 kilometers from Kunshan, and fought fiercely for several hours. Kunshan heard the sound of artillery fire. The Sujia Line has been opened by Chinese commando units, and Japanese military transportation is frequently obstructed. It is reported that the Chinese mobile units active on the Sujia Line are all equipped with the latest type of mortars and other weapons.

The Suburbs of Shanghai are Becoming More Active

The Shanghai Times reports that the New Fourth Route Army of China has arrived in areas closer to Shanghai and is showing increasing activity. It is widely believed that this is related to the second anniversary of the August 13th Shanghai battle. The Japanese military authorities claim that the Japanese garrison in Shanghai has taken the initiative to counter the infiltration of guerrillas. On August 2, battles occurred near Qingpu and Qishi. On August 3, a more intense battle occurred north of Jiading, with five Japanese soldiers injured. There were also several smaller skirmishes. The Japanese side claims to have completely controlled the situation and taken extensive precautions.

Traffic on Hongqiao Road in Western Shanghai is Cut Off

Since the New Fourth Army arrived in the suburbs of Shanghai, guerrillas have been extremely active. Therefore, Japanese soldiers on Hongqiao Road are conducting stricter inspections of passengers. Yesterday morning, traffic was cut off in the area, and villagers detoured through the Great Western Road. However, it was soon reopened.

Japanese Planes Fly Low for Reconnaissance Yesterday Morning

At 7:30 yesterday morning, a Japanese silver twin-engine seaplane circled back and forth over Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai for reconnaissance for half an hour before flying southwest. At 9:20, a gray bomber flew from northwest to southeast.

### No News of Relief for Unemployed Railway Workers

A report on the 7th of this month stated that the Ministry of Railways was trying to provide relief to unemployed railway workers. A reporter from the Huawen News Agency inquired at the liaison offices of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways to find out the truth. According to a Mr. X, the responsible representative of the office, the above news was sudden. Although the office had repeatedly petitioned the Ministry to find a way, there was no overall relief plan. However, the office is almost constantly working on how to relieve and evacuate employees. Previously, it had negotiated a portion of savings and other funds, and the custodial office is currently starting to settle these accounts. If there is a surplus, the office, for the benefit of all the evacuated employees of the two railways, should negotiate to reissue it. As for the news on the 7th, it is completely fabricated.

### Puppet Regime Induces Foreign Ships to Register Again, Another Attempt Comes to Nothing, Using the Return of Portuguese Ships After Registration as Bait, Portuguese Merchants Ignore and Continue to Seek Diplomatic Solutions

After the puppet "Weixin Government Ministry of Transportation" established a puppet "Maritime Administration Bureau" in Shanghai, in order to seize the right to manage ships and implement controlled shipping, it launched a ship registration campaign on April 1st, notifying Chinese and foreign shipping companies to register with the "Bureau" by the end of June in accordance with the "law," otherwise their ships would be prohibited from sailing and their ownership of the ships would be revoked. However, since the "August 13th" incident, all ships in Shanghai have been legally sold to countries such as Britain, Germany, Italy, Norway, and Portugal. There are almost no Chinese merchants left. General foreign merchants, because the governments of various countries do not recognize the puppet organization, have ignored the "Bureau's" notice. Now that the deadline has passed for a long time, no ships have registered, and the "Bureau's" plan has been completely shattered.

Sending Personnel to Induce Still Meets Firm Rejection

Since the puppet "Maritime Administration Bureau" failed because shipping companies from various countries ignored it, the puppet officials of the "Bureau" are in a very embarrassing situation. However, eager to profit, they are still unwilling to give up on this attempt. Therefore, they have repeatedly sent puppet officials, together with Japanese, to distribute registration forms to various shipping companies, inducing them to register. However, the attitudes of shipping companies from countries such as Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Norway are very firm, and they simply laugh off this move by the puppet "Bureau" and firmly reject it.

Coveting Portuguese Merchants, Ships Detained

The Japanese side previously used the excuse of unclear nationality to arbitrarily detain more than ten Portuguese merchant ships such as the Hailong, and the Portuguese Consulate General in Shanghai has repeatedly made serious representations. After four months, no solution has been reached, and the Portuguese merchants' shipping business has been completely suspended, resulting in losses. It is reported that the puppet "Maritime Administration Bureau" believes that there is an opportunity to take advantage of this and has repeatedly sent personnel to contact the companies, claiming that they can be returned after registration with the "Bureau," intending to lure them. However, the Portuguese merchants have a firm attitude and remain unmoved. In addition to continuing to request the consulate to resolve the matter through diplomatic channels, they ignore the puppet organization's encouragement. The "Bureau's" intention to covet has ultimately come to nothing.

### Exchange of Local Banknotes is Maximized, Tianjin-Shandong-Hankou Banknotes are Sent to the Mainland, All Other Local Banknotes are Accepted

Previously, banknotes from Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou were rejected by various industries, and the Shanghai market was once chaotic. After the head offices of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications instructed on the exchange method, the run on the banks subsided. Now, in addition to the banknotes and subsidiary currency notes from Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou, all other local banknotes are commonly used in the market. The details are as follows:

China Farmers Bank Requests Normal Acceptance

The China Farmers Bank sent a letter to the Silver and Money Trade Association, stating: "Dear Sirs, the banknotes issued by our bank in the names of Hangzhou, Xi'an, Fuzhou, Lanzhou, and other places, and the banknotes of the Hubei Provincial Bank reprinted by the China Farmers Bank, have long been regarded as banknotes without a specific location and are commonly used everywhere. Moreover, regardless of the amount, they can be exchanged at our branch at 609 Avenue Joffre in Shanghai at any time. We intend to request your association to forward a letter to the local firms and banks, stating that the banknotes issued by the China Farmers Bank in the names of various locations should be accepted as usual, and after being collected, they can be exchanged at our bank at any time, in order to facilitate circulation. We hereby send this letter to you, hoping that you will consider and approve it. We will be very grateful."

Various Banks are Maximizing Exchange

The four banks, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank, and the Central Bank, are maximizing the exchange of banknotes with local names, except for those from Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou, which are allowed to be sent to the mainland. The exchange time is from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. Banknotes from various commercial banks are also exchanged by the three banks, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Central Bank: (1) The Central Bank exchanges those from the China and South Sea Bank, the China Industrial and Commercial Bank, and the Sze Ming Bank; (2) The Bank of China exchanges those from the China General Chamber of Commerce Bank and the Agricultural and Commercial Bank; (3) The Bank of Communications exchanges those from the Zhejiang Xingye Bank, the Reclamation Bank, and the China Industrial Bank. Regarding the banknotes and subsidiary currency notes of the Zhejiang Local Bank, they can be exchanged at the Shanghai branch of the bank at 381 Jiangxi Road, from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM. However, subsidiary currency notes must be collected to one yuan before they can be exchanged. Subsidiary currency notes of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank (including the Xuzhou Pingshi Official Money Bureau) can be exchanged at the bank at 1182 Avenue Joffre, from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM.

### Zhaofeng Park String Concert

The Municipal Council Music Team will hold a string concert at Zhaofeng Park on the evening of August 8th from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM (weather permitting). The program includes six items.

### Illegal Rice Trading Flourishes, Formal Transactions Halted, Goods Arrive Continuously by Water and Land, Medical Community Advocates Scientifically Economic Food

The situation in the rice market was still very chaotic yesterday. Vendors did not display samples, and hoarders did not release goods, all adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, the market was noisy. There were about twelve or thirteen boats arriving from the Riverfront yesterday. By water and land, the Tongli Songjiang gangs also loaded two or three thousand bags. Goods on the way are still arriving continuously. Furthermore, a batch of new Zhoupu indica rice arrived yesterday, about one hundred bags, which were sold in the market. Rice dealers advised their counterparts to "comply with the price limit, and even if they purchase rice above the limit, they must sell it at the door at the limit," after which the counterparts sent letters to the association, vowing not to purchase rice above the limit. However, the market is still very chaotic, and illegal transactions have not stopped. Various types of japonica rice in the market have prices but no sales. It is hoped that the Municipal Bureau will crack down on illegal transactions, dredge the source, and stabilize people's hearts.

Scientifically Economic Food

Mr. Ding Fubao, a well-known figure in the medical community, has long studied the issue of food nutrition. According to him, under the current circumstances, it is impossible to suppress prices. Therefore, in terms of wheat consumption, one must seek the most economically healthy

### National Government Orders Crackdown on Illegal Armed Organizations, Using Resistance as a Pretext for Self-Interest, Colluding to Cause Trouble and Plot Evil

The National Government authorities recently received reports that some unscrupulous military and political figures are using resistance as a pretext for self-interest. They claim that there are so many people and guns in a certain place who are willing to be led, but in reality, they are selling air. Once they are given a name, they collude to cause trouble, and even entice friendly troops' officers and soldiers to defect, plotting evil. A circular order has been issued to the commanders of various military regions and the provincial authorities, stating that in the future, all those who establish private names without the approval of the central government or the war zone and are suspected of swindling will be strictly cracked down on. Scientific methods, for example, instead of eating expensive white rice, why not switch to cheaper brown rice? Not only can the amount be more than white rice, but it is also rich in vitamin B, which can prevent beriberi and has a natural laxative effect. As for meat foods, they only contain a large amount of fat and protein and do not contain any vitamins. On the contrary, eating too much fat and protein often causes dangerous diseases such as kidney disease, increased blood pressure, and hardening of blood vessels in the body.

Vegetarian Food is More Nutritious Than Meat

Therefore, instead of eating expensive meat, why not switch to all plant-based foods such as soybeans, red beans, peanuts, cabbage, tomatoes, potatoes, and spinach? Not only are they cheaper than meat, but they also contain sufficient vitamins A, B, and C, which can avoid the risk of diseases in all internal organs and improve health. If all sectors can implement this, it will be of great significance to the economy, health, and the entire food problem of the people. Mr. Ding has recently written two books, "Food and Premature Aging" and "Food Therapy," advocating economically scientific food.

### British Ships Continue to Sail in the Lower Yangtze River, Tonghe Ship Changes to Haimen-Qidong Route, Wulin Ship Extends Route

The shipping in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, such as Xingang, Dongjie Port, Zhanghuang Port, and Zhangjiagang, is entirely controlled by special forces, so it is not easy for foreign ships to operate. Especially British merchant ships are even more envied. The situation has been repeatedly reported in the previous newspaper. Therefore, the Taikoo and Jardine ships, the Wulin and Tonghe, which operate on the route, travel empty each time. The two companies continue to operate at the expense of sacrifice. Recently, the ports on the lower Yangtze River, such as Qinglong Port and Sanhe Port, have slightly more cargo to load and unload. Jardine Matheson & Co. has repaired the boilers of the Tonghe, which runs the Xingang line, after returning to Shanghai on the 3rd. The work was completed yesterday, and it is scheduled to change to the Haimen-Qidong line starting this morning, working in shifts with the Yihe. The Wulin of the Taikoo Company has also extended its route. In addition to Xingang, Dongjie Port, etc., it also serves the ports on the lower Yangtze River.

### Japanese Side Actually Issues Notice That Haimen Will be Blockaded Today

According to news from the Japanese side, the port of Haimen in Zhejiang Province, which has been blockaded by the Japanese Navy for two months, has recently had frequent sailing ships entering and leaving. Therefore, the Japanese Navy has decided to start strictly blockading the port from noon on the 8th (noon Japanese time is 11:00 AM Chinese time), prohibiting any ships from entering or leaving. This notice was issued by the Japanese Consulate General on the morning of the 7th to the customs and the diplomatic officials of various third countries, and it was also informed to the ships of third countries and the third-country people who wish to avoid the disaster to leave the Matsuura Gate, which is equipped with dangerous objects and obstacles, before noon on the 8th, so as to avoid accidents.

### Cathay Hotel on Pa Li Chiao Street: Bizarre Kidnapping Case Occurs; One Person Kidnapped, One Escapes Ingeniously

Yesterday around 6 PM, a bizarre kidnapping case occurred at a hotel on Pa Li Chiao Street in the French Concession. Details are recorded below:

Two travelers arrived at the Cathay Xinji Hotel, numbers 24 to 31 on Pa Li Chiao Road (i.e., West Xinqiao Street) in the French Concession, around 8 AM yesterday. Suddenly, two customers arrived, one dressed in a Western suit and the other in a Zhongshan suit. The one in the Zhongshan suit signed the register as Wang Shaowu, 36 years old, a businessman from Nanjing. The one in the Western suit only gave the surname Li. They were led to room 301 upstairs by a hotel attendant.

Sudden Arrival of Strange Men: After washing up briefly in the room, they went out together at 9 AM. They returned around 2 PM in the afternoon and did not go out again after that. At 6:20 PM, a brand new black-plated car (registration number 10227) suddenly drove up and stopped in front of the Cathay Hotel. Four burly men emerged from the car, two dressed in black Xiangyun gauze short outfits, one in white silk short shirt and pants, and one in a gray Zhongshan suit.

One Guest Escapes: After the four burly men got out of the car, they entered the Cathay Hotel, rushed upstairs, and went straight into room 301. Upon seeing Li and Wang inside, they didn't say a word and immediately helped them downstairs. Just as they were pulling the two men toward the car, intending to drag them into it, Li resisted. Wang Shaowu, seeing this, saw an opportunity and turned and ran south.

One Guest Kidnapped: As Wang ran towards the intersection of Caishi Street, intending to turn west, a deaf-mute beggar happened to be lingering by the roadside. Seeing Wang running in a panic, the beggar suspected that Wang was a thief and bravely stepped forward and grabbed him. Wang, seeing that the beggar was both deaf and mute and impossible to reason with, cried for help. Patrol officer number 1080 arrived and, after clarifying the situation, returned to the entrance of the Cathay Hotel, but Li, the four burly men, and the car were gone. Li had been kidnapped. The officer took Wang to the police station for questioning.

### Impacted by Japanese Interference: Trade of Various Countries Sharply Declines; Japanese Goods Imported from Occupied Ports Rank First; Accounting for Over 23% of National Import Trade

Xinsheng News Agency reports: After the Chinese government made efforts to adjust international trade, banning the import of non-essential goods and encouraging the export of major domestic products, it has achieved significant results. All ports in non-occupied areas have a trade surplus, but ports in occupied areas still have a trade deficit because the government's authority does not extend there. Shanghai and Tianjin ports are the most severe. All Japanese goods, as well as luxury and non-essential goods, are imported from the occupied areas. At the same time, there are anti-British and other movements in the occupied areas, greatly affecting trade between Britain, the United States, and China. Japan seeks to monopolize trade in the occupied areas. The following is a record of import trade between Britain, the United States, Germany, Japan, and other countries to China in the first half of this year:

Britain: Imports in January were valued at 5,198,706 yuan; in February, 3,762,112 yuan; in March, 6,487,937 yuan; in April, 6,396,107 yuan; in May, 9,718,252 yuan; and in June, 7,838,612 yuan. The total is 39,500,200 yuan, accounting for 5.45% of the total national import trade, ranking sixth.

United States: Imports in January were valued at 12,653,980 yuan; in February, 16,593,745 yuan; in March, 18,764,871 yuan; in April, 16,844,908 yuan; in May, 25,862,314 yuan; and in June, 21,328,636 yuan. The total is 112,049,000 yuan, accounting for 15.46% of the total national import trade, ranking second.

Germany: Imports in January were valued at 5,890,319 yuan; in February, 4,760,447 yuan; in March, 7,671,885 yuan; in April, 8,811,997 yuan; in May, 13,043,623 yuan; and in June, 11,188,793 yuan. The total is 51,367,000 yuan, accounting for 7.09% of the total national import trade, ranking fifth.

### Anti-British Slogans Distributed in the Bailinan Road Area: Fierce Criticism of the British Shows Obvious Backing; Those Distributing Leaflets Fled into "Badlands"

The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that at 9 PM last night (the 6th), three Chinese distributed leaflets fiercely criticizing "cunning and deceitful Britain" at the Five Corners intersection on Bailinan Road. This shows that the anti-British movement is rapidly spreading in China under Japanese protection. It is believed that these three Chinese are agitators distributing leaflets on public roads and near bus stops in the Public Concession.

When a Chinese constable tried to arrest them, the three fled into the "badlands" occupied by the Japanese army and controlled by the "Great Way Government." The leaflets were red and printed with fierce anti-British slogans, signed by the "Chinese People's Anti-British Discussion Society." The slogans are as follows: (1) Down with

cunning and deceitful Britain! (2) Resist British economic aggression in China! (3) Implement a complete economic break with Britain! (4) Demand the recovery of the concessions! (5) Young people in the new China must unite to resist the British! (6) Down with British imperialism, which seizes China's economic rights! (7) Unless our demands are met, we will fight the British to the end! (8) Britain is the public enemy of the East Asian national unity movement!

### Mine Deployment by Japanese Warships at Aojiangkou: Resumption of Shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou Again Obstructed

After the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou was prevented because Aojiangkou was blockaded with mines by Japanese warships, the shipping industry, in order to alleviate the transportation of passengers and goods between Shanghai and Wenzhou, had requested and obtained approval from the authorities to open Pingyang Aojiang. According to reports yesterday, Aojiangkou is now also being mined by Japanese warships. To avoid danger, the shipping companies have suspended sending ships. Therefore, the resumption of shipping to Aojiang is again obstructed.

The Hainan Company's Yangtze River, a Japanese ship chartered to sail to Dinghai and Daishan, arrived at Dinghai Doutou on the 4th but was refused landing by the Japanese army. After much negotiation, it was finally allowed to dock the next afternoon. The ship did not have any catering facilities for passengers, causing great suffering. Subsequently, Japanese soldiers boarded the ship for inspection, and passengers without permits

were beaten and humiliated. The ship then returned to Shanghai. After the fall of Dinghai, the city is extremely desolate because people are hiding. Families with women are having sleepless nights. Travelers wishing to return to Dinghai should carefully consider their plans before embarking, to avoid unnecessary losses and suffering.

### National Federation of Commerce Issues Certificates of Domestic Goods: Can Be Processed for Shipment to the Interior and Southeast Asia Without Charge

### Owner of Egg Shop Demands Payment: Attacks Detective; Also Snatches His Pistol; Eventually Arrested and Detained in Police Station

The Taichang Egg Shop at 285 Caishi Street in the French Concession is owned by businessman Chen Longhua. Lu Axiang, a Shaoxing native, is an egg vendor who has been doing business with Taichang for years. Yesterday afternoon, as Lu was riding a bicycle past the entrance of Taichang Shop, he was stopped by Chen Longhua, who demanded payment of 38 yuan. Lu said that the debt existed, but not for that amount. The two argued and were taken to the police station. The police chief said that the matter was a civil matter and was not convenient to intervene, and ordered the two to leave. After Lu left the police station, he intended to return to the Taichang Shop to retrieve his bicycle, but Chen wanted to detain the bicycle. Lu had no choice but to report to the police station again. The police chief ordered detective Wu Wengang to go to Taichang to investigate. Wu went with Lu, but the owner of Taichang, Chen Longhua, not only refused to return the bicycle, but also spoke rudely to detective Wu and ordered the shop assistants and old staff to surround and beat detective Wu, and even snatched detective Wu's pistol. Detective Wu returned to the police station to report, and the police chief immediately sent a large number of detectives to search. The scene was in the kitchen of the shop, and Wu's pistol was found. Chen, the shop assistants, and the old staff who committed the violence were arrested and detained in the police station, waiting to be sent to the Second Special District Court for trial.

### Do Not Injure the Functions Related to Happiness

If you want to achieve consistency in love and produce excellent children to propagate offspring, the first question is to see if your physical strength is healthy. The union of men and women is originally for the exchange of love, so a healthy sexual function is nothing less than the key to opening the door to happiness between men and women.

If we humans all pursue the ideal of "complete detachment from the physical body as the end," then we will soon see that the environment will change greatly, and humanity will be destroyed.

We are, after all, one of the creatures in the biological world. Naturally, there are two major desires in the biological world: appetite and love. We should carefully observe these two major desires. Appetite must be hygienic, so why not love? Therefore, if you misuse your body or ignorantly injure the sexual functions related to happiness, it is truly unimaginable.

From the sweet and delicate physique of the loved one—this physique, which is the original instinct of animals, makes us love not only give birth to new life, but also expand the scope of human sympathy and increase spiritual understanding. In fact, love is the foundation of love between husband and wife, and all sources of happiness can be taken inexhaustibly and inexhaustibly from sexual power. Its potential power is indeed great.

Therefore, the pleasure between men and women will naturally arise after the contact of love between the two sides. Men, except for complete kidney atrophy, can fully enjoy it. It is not the same for women. If a man's energy is lost and he suffers from premature ejaculation, then the sweet dream will disappear.

These problems of premature ejaculation and kidney atrophy should not be indulged and must be treated. In addition to excessive self-pity and too early marriage, the reasons for suffering from these problems are due to indulgence and licentiousness after marriage and addiction to drugs. At this time, testicular endocrine therapy should be actively applied to restore the original healthy love. Speaking of this, I will use my sixteen years of clinical experience to explain the therapeutic effect of "Butiren," a true testicular essence preparation that is unanimously praised by modern physicians, on this disease.

"Butiren" promotes the prosperity of every cell, cultivates brain power, promotes development, and can rejuvenate the old when taken before old age. It treats premature ejaculation and kidney atrophy like wind sweeping away leaves, proving that its medicinal power can generate sperm and nourish the kidneys in a short period of time, and then the love between husband and wife can be coordinated.

Modern Medicine

### Health is the Mother of Success

— Huang Zhongchang, MD

The achievement of great careers depends entirely on the soundness of one's spirit and body. Because of the soundness of the body and spirit, all actions have spirit as their backing. Those heroes who have been in the limelight, such as Mussolini and Hitler, all have the tenacity and decisiveness of spirit to achieve them. A career can be achieved. And this kind of spirit of Bi Yi, solid more out of a healthy physique. Generally speaking, people's physique is not very different, but mostly due to acquired destruction, such as excessive labor, undeveloped and self-destructing, excessive self-disrespect, early marriage, and then relying on the youth glands for development, which are suddenly hindered. Losing the foundation of health, those who suffer from incomplete lower development are mostly mentally depressed and exhausted, and their muscles are loose. Especially for young people with incomplete development, nocturnal emission, and premature ejaculation, their will is even more decadent. To want one's career to take off and prosper in this way is equivalent to trying to scoop the moon out of the water, which is absolutely impossible.

However, there are many famous people who were not necessarily virgins or healthy in body and spirit at first, but were able to achieve immortal careers because they were able to save themselves in time. And "Butiren" is indeed the best medicine for generally because of youth development period; excessive self-pity, early marriage, lack of self-discipline in sex, excessive hard work, etc. to lose health. Many great entrepreneurs in their early years suffered too much loss, but still regained their health with "Butiren," so that they were able to achieve the goal of establishing a great career, and also obtained the husband and wife's love, and grew old together. There are those who, in their youth or childhood, have weakened their performance in middle age, lack memory, are mentally depressed, are not interested in work, and have no career success due to self-pity, early marriage, and lack of self-discipline in sex. They can quickly take "Butiren" to save themselves. As long as they take one bottle of "Butiren," their spirit will be shaken up, their muscles will be filled, their faces will be rosy and radiant. Everything can be restored to the age of youth.

### One Should Come to One's Senses Early with Lung Disease

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Most patients with lung disease have a few light chins from time to time, or severe coughing, loss of appetite, mental depression, and weight loss, and then the symptoms of consumption become. If effective treatment can be given at this time, it can be expected to be cured radically, and the effect is easy to achieve. If it is delayed until the second or third stage of severe illness, it cannot be cured without a long period of time. Therefore, patients with lung disease should be treated as early as possible. However, it is also difficult to find an internal medicine that is suitable for treating tuberculosis, which is what I have always felt in my 20 years of clinical experience. However, since Dr. Tume of Germany invented "Bofei Naer," I have been relieved. The efficacy of "Bofei Naer" has the effect of reducing the oxygen of lung disease, and making the lung disease bacteria lose its activity. Therefore, the symptoms of tuberculosis, hemoptysis, cough, phlegm, chest pain, night sweats, and tidal fever can be cured without exception.

### Cure Case of Nocturnal Emission: Nocturnal Emission Due to Congenital Deficiency

— Zheng Ting, MD from Germany

Patient: Wan Chengde, 20 years old. (Self-report) Because of my congenital deficiency, I have been weak and sickly since I was a child. In addition, due to the lack of coordination after the illness, my body is so weak that I cannot bear it. I had nocturnal emission when I was 17 years old. Although I took medicine for treatment at that time, it was not effective at all. Now, nocturnal emission occurs frequently, development is incomplete, and the genitals are no different from those of a child. In addition, I have weak brain and insomnia, so I came here for treatment. (Cure process) I told him to take nutritious food, gave him "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Tablets" to stop nocturnal emission, and also took the German male "Butiren" three times a day to supplement it. After three months of treatment, nocturnal emission has stopped, and development has been completely restored.

### Nocturnal Emission Injured by Self-Pity

Patient: Ling Qihai, 23 years old. (Self-report) In his early years, he was harmed by erotic books and committed the bad habit of self-pity. He did it every night, and his essence and blood were greatly depleted. After half a year, he had nocturnal emission. Because he did not receive treatment, the condition gradually deteriorated. Now, he ejaculates when he sees color, his brain is weak and unconscious, and he is in extreme pain. (Cure process) Daily electrotherapy for 15 minutes, taking a large amount of "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Tablets" and "Butiren," and treated for more than three months, his health gradually recovered.

Gonorrhea Symposium

### Do Not Be Sad About Joy Causing Sorrow

— Said by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: Intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road, No. 9

Generally speaking, people who suffer from gonorrhea come into contact with unclean prostitutes. Therefore, some people say that this is the result of joy causing sorrow. But I don't know that these kinds of sorrows cannot be relieved. Because now, due to scientific progress, this kind of difficult-to-treat gonorrhea has been conquered by science, and this kind of leucorrhea, which has always been regarded as a magic disease, has finally been completely and fundamentally solved.

However, in my more than 20 years of experience, there are not a few patients who cannot escape the poisonous claws of this disease demon for the rest of their lives and wait for death in disgust. In this way, wouldn't it be that once you get gonorrhea, you will never be able to enjoy the pleasure of health? Is it true that one moment of romance is a hundred years of regret? In fact, this is not necessarily the case. Because these people mistakenly believe in generally exaggerated advertisements and say that one or two bottles and one or two treatments can completely cure the disease. This is really beyond reason and is tens of thousands of miles away from science. To sum up, the treatment of gonorrhea focuses on practice, not on verbal and written propaganda, which has nothing to do with actual gonorrhea. The reason why general patients often fall into a pessimistic situation is probably because they are misled by those therapies that are far from scientific facts. Based on my actual clinical experience of more than 20 years, a precise diagnosis should be made first, and then a proper treatment method should be determined. For patients to cause pessimism about gonorrhea, the sequelae of chronic gonorrhea are a bad omen. Its toxins spread throughout the body. At this time, German anti-gonorrhea blood serum should be used, and special medicine for gonorrhea "Kelinong" should be taken internally to make the whole body cells completely develop an anti-gonorrhea phagocytic effect, then all the gonorrhea bacteria hidden in the depths will be completely eradicated, but it also takes three to five weeks to cure. Many pessimists of gonorrhea often take "Kelinong" and are completely cured. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. From today, 20 numbers will be sent for diagnosis every day, and each number will only cost 50 cents. A copy of "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth 1 yuan will also be given.

### First Peak of Autumn Flood: Huangpu River Tide Will Reach the Shore

The high tide of Shanghai's Huangpu River is set to officially begin on the 15th of this month. At that time, the tide will reach the shore along the river, which is a matter of great concern.

Beginning of Autumn Flood

According to a report from the Datong News Agency, autumn officially begins on the 8th of this month. The first high tide of this year will occur on the 15th of this month and the high tide on the 17th may even exceed the height of the Bund embankment. Therefore, the tide will flood the shore, causing a considerable amount of water damage.

First High Tide

The first autumn flood high tide will last for a week starting on the 15th of this month. The time and quantity of the tide have been measured by the Hydraulics Department of the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau. The tide at 12:00 AM on the 15th is estimated to be 11 feet 7 and a half inches, and the tide at 12:50 PM will be 10 feet 5 inches.

Most Noteworthy

The tide will continue to rise. The tide at 12:46 AM on the 16th will be 12 feet 4.4 inches, and the tide at 1:31 PM will be 11 feet 8 inches. The tide at 1:30 AM on the 17th is the most noteworthy, reaching 13 feet 1.5 inches, and the tide at 2:10 PM will be 11 feet 7 inches.

Large Volume of Water

The water level will also be high starting on the 18th. The tide at 2:14 AM will be 12 feet 8 inches, and the tide at 2:49 PM will be 11 feet 9 inches. The tide at 3:00 AM on the 19th will be 12 feet 4 inches, and the tide at 3:26 PM will be 11 feet 7.4 inches.

Total of Seven Days

Starting on the 20th, the water volume will drop slightly. The tide at 3:38 AM will be 12 feet 1 inch, and the tide at 4:07 PM will be 11 feet 5.5 inches. The tide at 4:20 AM on the 21st will be 10 feet 5.5 inches, and the tide at 5:00 PM will be 10 feet 6.5 inches. The above totals seven days.

Tide Will Inevitably Reach the Shore

The height of the Bund embankment is only 13 feet. Compared to the tide on the 17th, the height will exceed the embankment by 1.5 inches. The tide will inevitably flood the land. If there are strong winds and rain, the water problems Shanghai will face will be even more concerning. During the high tide period, water accumulation in the low-lying areas of the roads is inevitable.

### Apartment Resident Almost Kidnapped; Neighbor Shouts for Help, One Person Apprehended

### Forced to Death Over Gambling Debts at a Flower Game

Xia Desheng, a local resident, 34 years old, ran a tobacco and paper store at 62 Zhujia Ku, Route Haig. Yesterday, Xia's son (14 years old) had a strange dream the previous night, so he secretly took money to place a bet at the Helihua flower game listening booth at number 8. He happened to win, and was supposed to receive 91 yuan in winnings. However, the gambling den cheated him because he was a child and refused to pay him a cent. Xia's son then went home and told his father. Xia went with him to negotiate, but the den owner, Kong Wenbao, threatened him and ordered his gang members to beat Xia severely. In the end, he even ordered Xia to pay 500 yuan as compensation for his reputation and had to apologize in public. Xia, with his small business, was forced under duress and returned home in tears. Yesterday morning at around 3 AM, he secretly took poison and committed suicide. Afterwards, his family took him to the Red Cross Hospital, but he died before he could be saved. The police are paying close attention to the case and are strictly pursuing the perpetrators. (Social News Agency)

### Prostitute Defrauded of Huge Sum; Silk Store Owner Detained; Embezzled 80,000-90,000 Yuan Indulged in Gambling Dens; Claimed Speculation Failure, Not Fraud

Gao Zhenyi, a native of Hangzhou, 29 years old, currently residing at 126 Zhaofeng Villa, Brenan Road, Shanghai, is the son of Gao Ziyan, the owner of the famous Shanghai-Hangzhou Gaoyitai Silk Store. Because of his wealthy family, Gao Zhenyi frequented brothels, and several years ago became acquainted with the famous Shanghai prostitute Wen Di Lao Si Ying Huizhen (i.e., the madam of the Wen Di brothel at 233 Wuling Lane, Guangxi Road). Since the outbreak of the war, Hangzhou fell, and Gao moved his family to Shanghai. Thus, Gao Zhenyi and Wen Di Lao Si became even closer. Gao knew that Lao Si had quite a bit of savings, and that women are naturally eager to seek profits. So, in the autumn of last year, he suddenly told Lao Si that he was planning to gather a large amount of capital to purchase cotton, salt, rice, and other goods in the interior, transport them to Shanghai for sale, and would definitely make a substantial profit. He asked her if she was interested in investing. Wen Di Lao Si

was deceived by his business talk and believed that Gao was the son of a wealthy family and would have no other intentions. She successively paid Gao more than 40,000 yuan in cash and 43 diamonds worth 2,200 yuan as capital. At the same time, Wen Di Lao Si also persuaded her acquaintance Mrs. Wu (i.e., the wife of Wu Zishen, who lived at 154 Xianglin Lane, Weihaiwei Road, and was recently kidnapped) to invest 2,000 yuan, Xu Loushi (who lived at 2 Anle Village, Avenue Foch) to invest 9,000 yuan, Gu Guoying (who lived at 109 Jiaoming Village, Avenue Foch) to invest 3,000 yuan in cash and two diamond rings worth 8,100 yuan, and Zhang Xiuzhen (who lived at 5 Ping'an Lane, Route Cardinal Foch) to invest in a Shanghai Bank

passbook with a balance of 15,000 yuan and 2,000 yuan in cash, for a total of no less than 80,000 to 90,000 yuan that Wen Di Lao Si handed over to Gao. However, after obtaining the money, Gao did not engage in the so-called cotton, salt, and rice business. Instead, he used the money to frequent gambling dens such as Hollywood, Qiuyue, and Caojiabo Rongsheng Company on Yuyuan Road. Over the months, he spent most of it. He also suffered losses from dealing in daily gold bills and drafts, exhausting all the money he had swindled. To Wen Di and the others, he claimed that the goods and rice had not arrived or paid some interest as a stopgap measure. It was not until now that Wen Di Lao Si

realized that she had been defrauded and reported it to the Old Gate Police Station. Chinese Detective Pang Ruiqing, Jia Huijun, and Detective Cao Qishan investigated Gao's whereabouts. Yesterday morning at 1:30 AM, when Gao left gambling dens such as Hollywood and Qiuyue on Yuyuan Road and passed Yidingpan Road, he was apprehended by the detectives. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu briefly presented the case, stating that the case still needed to be investigated. Therefore, he requested permission to detain him temporarily for investigation. When questioned, Gao claimed that the money was borrowed because of the failure of the Xinhua Silver Company he operated on Jiangxi Road, not fraud. Judge Fang Qinghuan verified the confession and ordered Gao Zhenyi to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.

### Paper Package of Banknotes Robbed

He then snatched the paper package from the man's arm and fled. The victim immediately called for help, but the robbers had already gone far away and could not be caught. He reported the incident to the police station and revealed that the paper package contained 1,200 yuan in legal tender.

### Zhejiang People in Shanghai Commemorate Mao Sicheng

### Ordered Cotton Yarn from Japanese Merchant Mill; Salesman Embezzled Through Fraud; Squandered Over Ten Thousand Yuan Twice in Gambling Dens

Xi Wenguang (also known as Huan Zuocai), a native of Changzhou, 21 years old, worked as a salesman at the Qiuxing Yarn Mill at 406 Jiangxi Road. On April 17 of this year, he was ordered by the store owner to purchase 100 bales of July cotton yarn from the Gongji Yarn Company at 6 Tongde Lane, Zhilan Street, and paid a 5% deposit of 2,500 yuan. Afterwards, Xi

order form

handed over to the store owner. On June 1, Xi was given a check from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank by the owner, instructing him to order 300 bales of cotton yarn from the Tongxing Yarn Mill. Xi also handed over the order form to the store. The Gongji Yarn Company and Tongxing Yarn Mill order forms given by Xi to the store were stolen, and the

seal

of Gongji Yarn Company and the private seal of Terauchi Kogao, the Japanese person in charge of Tongxing, were forged and stamped on them. In reality, he did not order cotton yarn from the above two companies, but embezzled the 12,500 yuan deposit and deposited it in banks such as the Jiaotong Bank. Then every night he went to the Hollywood gambling den on Yuyuan Road and the Rongsheng Company and other gambling dens

gamble wildly

and frequently went to the major dance halls, lavishing money on his favorite dancers. As a result, in less than a month or two, he had exhausted his funds. There were only a few dozen yuan left in the bank. On August 1, when the store owner went to Gongji and Tongxing to pick up the goods, he discovered that the two order forms were forged. He reported it to the General Police Station. Chinese Detective Yang Peisheng and Detective Cheng Renkun

arrested

Xi on the 6th. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian explained the process. Because further investigation was needed, he requested permission to postpone the hearing. Xi also hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xiefen, he was ordered to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.

### Adopted Son Disregards Support, Seizes School Property and Refuses to Hand Over

According to China News Agency, the recent lawsuit involving Jingli Primary School and a mother and son has caused a stir in society. The school was established by Zhang Ziying of Zhenhai and has been in existence for nearly 30 years. In the summer of the 25th year, Zhang passed away, and the school board appointed Shui Xiangyun as the principal. After the Shanghai war, Principal Shui left Shanghai for personal reasons, and the school affairs were taken over by Zhang's adopted son, Zhang Fuhua,

who called himself the principal. Zhang Fuhua was an abandoned child that Zhang's wife found in the alley. Zhang's wife had no children and loved him more than her own. However, Zhang considered him to be of inferior character since childhood and repeatedly tried to drive him out, but was dissuaded by his mother. Unexpectedly, after Zhang's death, Fuhua treated his mother with disrespect, and his words and actions were rude. Friends and relatives tried to persuade him, but were also rejected.

### Pacific Hurricane Dissipated, Strange Clear Sky Thunderbolt

Two newly formed hurricanes in the Pacific Ocean have dissipated. There are no signs of any hurricanes continuing to form in the Pacific Ocean. Yesterday's weather was clear and sunny, with rain at noon, but it soon stopped. Yesterday, on the 4th of this month, at 3:00 PM, a thunderbolt was suddenly heard in the clear sky.

### Blocking North Jiangxi Road, Westerner Jumps to Suicide, Relying on Rent to Maintain Family, Forced to Relocate, Sudden Economic Hardship

Liang Luanjie, a young Cantonese man working as a clerk in the engineering department on the third floor of the British Taikoo Yanghang on the Bund in the French Concession, was 20 years old and had been employed for over a year. His monthly salary was only 15 yuan. His family lived in a certain house in Taihua Lane on North Jiangxi Road. The house belonged to Liang's second landlord, who subleased the remaining rooms to others, earning dozens of gold yuan per month to supplement the family's income, which was enough to make ends meet. However, recently the North Jiangxi Road area was designated as a restricted area, blocking the various lanes in the area, and all residents were forced to relocate. Liang was struck by this blow like a bolt from the blue. The entire family had to move elsewhere. With a family of seven, Liang's meager income was unable to support his family. After thinking about it repeatedly, he found it impossible to survive and decided to commit suicide. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:45 PM, he jumped from the roof of the firm, landing at the entrance of the firm, injuring his head and brain, and blood flowed like a spring. The nearby police arrived and urgently summoned an ambulance to Renji Hospital. However, due to excessive blood loss, he died on the way before he could be treated. It is reported that the deceased had written a suicide note to his family, the contents of which were very tragic.

Also, it was reported that Liang Luanjie, a 26-year-old Cantonese man without a family, had been working as a clerk at Yanghang Taikoo, 22 Huangpu Beach, French Concession for nearly two years. Recently, due to limited income, which was insufficient for personal expenses, he became tired of life. Yesterday morning at 8 o'clock, in the office of the firm, he wrote a death note at his desk, and then went to the roof on the fifth floor to take Lysol poison to commit suicide. After taking the poison, he lay on the roof waiting for the arrival of the god of death. However, by 3:30 p.m., Liang, although poisoned, was still conscious, and seeing that he had not achieved his goal of immediate death, he jumped from the roof on the fifth floor and fell to the ground, injuring his head and falling into a coma. Passers-by saw it and reported it to Taikoo Yanghang, who reported it to the French Police Department, who sent detectives to investigate. The suicide note of Liang was retrieved and an ambulance was summoned to Renji Hospital. Since he had suffered a double blow, he died within a few minutes of arriving at the hospital. The police transferred the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Corpse Examination Office to examine the corpse and wait for the court to inspect it today.

### Jiangsu Province Middle Schools Resuming Classes in Shanghai, Measures for Accepting Transfer Students, Education Department Answers Three Difficult Questions

(Taixian Communication) The Jiangsu Education Department recently issued an order to provincial secondary schools, stating that according to the reports from various public and private secondary schools resuming classes in Shanghai, the following difficulties have been encountered when enrolling transfer students: (1) Can transfer students be admitted to the third year of senior and junior high school? (2) Can students from unregistered private schools be accepted when they request to transfer? (3) Can students who have withdrawn from puppet schools in guerrilla areas and come to Shanghai for education be accepted? The following measures are proposed: (1) Transfer and temporary study for senior and junior high school students, in accordance with Article 10 of the "Measures for Transfer and Temporary Study of Students in Schools at All Levels in War Zones" promulgated by the Ministry of Education, are not limited to grade level, but must enroll at the beginning of the academic year or semester. (2) According to Article 7 of the "Measures for Issuing Certificates by Schools in War Zones" promulgated by the Ministry of Education, "graduation certificates and graduation certificates issued by unregistered private secondary schools and below are invalid." Students from unregistered private schools should not be admitted when they request to transfer. (3) For students who have withdrawn from puppet schools in guerrilla areas and come to Shanghai for education, each school should inquire in detail and strictly examine them. If they are indeed brave enough to extricate themselves and there is evidence of remorse, they may be admitted at their discretion. However, any certificates or proof issued by puppet schools should be deemed invalid. Each student should be required to participate in a grade placement test based on their original educational qualifications. Those who pass the test will be allowed to enroll in the corresponding grade for study. The above items should be followed.

### Overview of Unified Enrollment of National Colleges and Universities in the 27th Academic Year (Part 2)

Students Exempt from Examination

In the 27th academic year, in addition to the unified examination, the Ministry of Education formulated measures for exemption from examination for outstanding students in the high school joint examinations held by various provinces and cities this year, and for graduates of national high schools, in accordance with the outline of the unified enrollment method. The number of outstanding students from various provinces recommended for joint examinations is limited to the top 15% of students who pass the high school joint examination. The number of graduates from national high schools recommended for exemption from examination is limited to those who have graduated with honors (Grade A). The students recommended for exemption from examination by various provinces and national high schools shall be reviewed by the Unified Enrollment Committee of the Ministry of Education and assigned according to the students' wishes. If the number of students admitted to the desired school through the examination is too large, the number of students admitted without examination shall not exceed 15% of the total number of admissions. The number of students recommended by various provinces and national high schools and approved by the Ministry of Education is as follows: Shaanxi Middle School 6, Henan Middle School 3, Sichuan Middle School 29, Guizhou Middle School 20, Gansu Middle School 6, Northeast Middle School 13, Guangxi Province 29, Sichuan Province 103, Hubei Province 105, Jiangxi Province 51, Gansu Province 6, Guizhou Province 4, Yunnan Province 6, totaling 401. Except for 5 students in Sichuan Province and 53 students in Hubei Province who have not completed the procedures and have been temporarily delayed in their assignment, the remaining 343 students have been assigned to various schools. The Central University has the largest number of students assigned, with 74, followed by the Southwest Associated University with 52 and the Northwest Institute of Technology with 51. The schools with the fewest number of students assigned are Guiyang Medical College and National Normal College, with 1 each. By category, 244 students are in science and engineering, 78 in liberal arts, and 21 in normal education. Among them, engineering is the most numerous, with 170, and business is the least, with only 2.

The unified entrance examination for national colleges and universities was held simultaneously in 12 locations, including Wuchang, Changsha, Ji'an, Guangzhou, Guilin, Guiyang, Kunming, Chongqing, Chengdu, Nanzheng, Yanping and Yongkang. As for the issue of high school graduates in Shanghai, in addition to studying at the various schools currently located in Shanghai, there must be many students who wish to enter universities in the rear. In order to facilitate the admission of students from Shanghai, the Ministry of Education has decided to adopt measures for national colleges and universities in Shanghai to recruit new students on behalf of national colleges and universities in the rear. Jiaotong University, Jinan University, and Shanghai Medical University will recruit new students on behalf of national colleges and universities in the rear while recruiting new students for their own colleges. The Ministry of Communications on behalf of recruiting freshmen in three colleges of science, engineering and agriculture, Jinan University on behalf of recruiting freshmen in four colleges of liberal arts, law, science and business, Shanghai Medical College on behalf of recruiting freshmen in the medical college, students who are admitted to national colleges and universities in the rear will be exempt from tuition fees. After the examination, the Ministry of Education will review the scores of the candidates. It is estimated that 270 students will be recruited on behalf of the university, including 45 from Jiaotong University, 195 from Jinan University, and 30 from Shanghai Medical College. Yunnan University has the largest number of students assigned, with 65, and Sichuan University has the fewest, with 5. Comparing the departments to which students are assigned, science and engineering account for 182, liberal arts account for 49, and normal education accounts for 39.

The unified enrollment situation for the 27th academic year is roughly as described above. To sum up the results: (1) It eliminates the suffering of students from repeatedly taking examinations for schools. This is very important in peacetime, and is certainly necessary in wartime. (2) The total number of admissions for unified enrollment is relatively large. If the applicant's performance is satisfactory, they can be admitted. Even if their desired school is already full, they can still be assigned to other schools, reducing the difficulty of not being able to go to school. (3) Admitted students can be reasonably distributed to various colleges and universities, which is sufficient to realize the predetermined goals of educational administration and improve the efficiency of education. The first unified enrollment has achieved the above three points. However, it was the first time it was held, and the preparation time was very rushed. The test method may not be thorough. How to improve it is being researched and planned by the Ministry of Education. In the future, it is planned to add provincial colleges and universities, and will also be held, a unified enrollment for national, provincial and private colleges above the vocational level, and gradually a unified enrollment will be carried out.

### Finance: Speculation and Large-Scale Covering, Foreign Exchange Tightening Continues, British Exchange Breaks 4 Shillings, US Dollar 7.625 Yuan

Yesterday was the first Monday of August. It was a bank holiday in England as usual, and Hong Kong was also closed. Foreign banks in this city were open as usual, as they had moved the holiday to Confucius' birthday on August 27th. In the foreign exchange market, both the exchange rate and the listed price did not fluctuate. In the black market for British and American exchange, the market was initially stable and strong because the yarn and silk merchants were selling, and the Japanese banks continued to sell. Later, Chinese speculators suddenly came to cover their positions, and foreign firms also settled accounts, causing the market to turn soft. However, the midday close for British and American exchange was similar to the morning opening. After the close, the situation tightened as speculators continued to cover. In the afternoon, the speculation of speculators and foreign firms such as Xinfeng and Hesheng became more intense, and Japanese banks such as Zhenjin also suddenly came to buy. In addition, the Hong Kong speculators telegraphed to buy and settle accounts. HSBC was initially willing to supply settlement, but soon reversed to absorb, so the situation lacked support and continued to soften. By the late close, the unprecedentedly tight price of 3 shillings and 9.0625 pence for British gold and 7.625 yuan for US dollars had been created, breaking the historical tight record of 4 shillings and 7.75 yuan for US dollars on the 21st of last month. The futures situation for this month also followed, first flattening and then tightening. Finally, British continued to tighten by 1.5625, and the US dollar was more expensive by 0.25. Because the difference between the spot and this month was not large, arbitrage disappeared, and the current period transaction was still strong.

Japanese Merchants First Sell and Then Aggressively Buy

In the early morning, the long and short positions for London's major strips were both up 0.125, New York's silver was closed, the London spot gold was still flat, the exchange rate for British against US and against French were both flat, against Shanghai small 0.1875, the central government listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 4 shillings and 0.09375 pence for British gold and 7.9375 yuan for US dollars, with no changes from the midday close last Saturday. After opening, the Chinese yarn and silk merchants suddenly came to sell, making the situation quite stable. It is estimated that the foreign banks such as Hua Bi were given the spot price of 4 shillings and 0.125 pence for British gold, and the spot price of 8 yuan for the US dollar. When HSBC announced the listed price, there were no changes, and the silver balance tax was still waived. After that, the Japanese banks also came to sell, and the Chinese merchants still had intentions to sell, so the market was strong. It is estimated that the Japanese banks sold the spot price of 4 shillings and 0.125 pence for British gold to the foreign banks. At the same time, they also successively sold the spot prices of 8 yuan and 8.03125 yuan for the US dollar to the US banks such as Datong. At that time, the British banks were profitable by absorbing the US dollar at 7.75 yuan for this month from the peer banks. Later, the Chinese speculators suddenly stopped selling and began to buy, and foreign firms also settled accounts slightly, so the market turned soft. It is estimated that the speculators settled the US dollar at 7.6875 yuan for this month at Datong. Then they bought the spot prices of 7.9375 yuan for the US dollar from the foreign banks such as Maigali. After that, they bought the spot prices of 4 shillings and 0.09375 pence and 0.0625 pence for British gold from Maigali and Hua Bi. It was already noon. The bank's midday close spot selling price was 4 shillings and 0.09375 pence for British gold and 7.9375 yuan for US dollars. The British gold for this month was 3 shillings and 9.375 pence, and the US dollar was 7.625 yuan. It was heard that after the close, the British gold softened to 4 shillings and 0.03125 pence, and the US dollar also tightened to 7.875 yuan.

HSBC Absorbs in the Afternoon

In the after-market, foreign firms frequently came to buy and settle accounts, and the market became tighter. It is estimated that the foreign firms settled the spot price of 4 shillings for British gold at HSBC. After that, Japanese banks such as Zhenjin and Chinese merchants and yarn and silk merchants also competed to aggressively buy. In addition, Hong Kong speculators also telegraphed to buy and settle accounts. In addition, HSBC stopped supplying and instead absorbed, so the situation became tighter. British gold immediately broke into the 4 shillings. It is estimated that Japanese banks such as Zhenjin, Hong Kong, and Chinese merchants settled the spot price of 3 shillings and 9.375 pence for British gold from foreign banks such as Youli, and the spot prices of 7.75 yuan and 6.875 yuan for the US dollar. At that time, HSBC absorbed the British gold at 3 shillings and 8.125 pence for this month from the peer banks. Later, a certain bank sold the US dollar at 7.375 yuan for this month to the Chinese merchants. After entering, foreign firms such as Hesheng and Xinfeng also bought the spot price of 7.6875 yuan for the US dollar from the British banks and Youli. By the late close, the bank's spot selling price was 3 shillings and 9.0615 pence for British gold and 7.625 yuan for US dollars. The British gold for this month was 3 shillings and 75 pence, and the US dollar was 7.3125 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous weekend, the spot price of British continued to tighten by 0.1875, and the US dollar softened by 0.3125. The British gold for this month tightened by 1.5825, and the US dollar was more expensive by 0.25.

### No Large Supply of Foreign Exchange, Gold Approaching 4,000 Yuan Mark Again, Still More Than 600 Yuan Lower if Calculated by British and American Exchange Rates

Yesterday, in the black market for cash sycee, the price fluctuated around 3,800 yuan due to people's confusion and constant buying and selling. At one point, it fell to a low of 3,775 yuan. The midday close, however, had already recovered to a high of 3,840 yuan. In the afternoon, the market situation suddenly tightened due to the lack of foreign exchange maintenance. British gold actually broke into the 4 shilling mark, stimulating buying sentiment. Non-professional buyers also flocked to the market. In addition, a foreign firm also came to search for purchases. The selling side's willingness to supply suddenly diminished. The rising trend exploded again, breaking the 3,900 yuan mark. At one point, it reached a high of 3,970 yuan, nearing the 4,000 yuan mark. It finally closed at 3,960 yuan, a sharp increase of 105 yuan compared to last weekend. If calculated by the late close domestic settlement price of British gold, it would be 4,550 yuan, and the US dollar would be 4,605.7 yuan, more than 600 yuan higher than the above price. This is because some wealthy merchants have a stronger psychological preference for storing foreign exchange than gold due to the recent complex international situation. Transaction was brisk today, with over a thousand taels changing hands. Jewelry gold was finally listed at 10 yuan higher. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stagnant.

Sycee Rises by 105 Yuan

Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels), the market was initially slightly fatigued, and it was heard that foreign exchange was quite stable. The opening price was 55 yuan lower than last weekend's midday close. Qian Dui Ye sold 20 taels to Jin Hao at a price of 3,800 yuan. Then it fell another 10 yuan. A Jin Hao sold 10 taels to a certain Jin Hao at a price of 3,790 yuan. Although a certain Jin Hao stopped selling and started selling, the Qian Dui Ye's appetite was very strong, and the market rebounded. Soon, it returned to 40 yuan higher. Qian Dui Ye bought 10 taels from a certain Jin Hao at a price of 3,830 yuan. A certain Jin Hao then turned to buying and aggressively absorbed dozens of taels, causing the price to rise. A certain Jin Hao bought 20 taels from the securities firm at a price of 3,847 taels. The securities firm then came to sell again, and a certain Jin Hao also suddenly came to sell, and the market became fatigued again, plunging 72 yuan. Qian Dui Ye sold 10 taels to Jin Hao at a price of 3,775 yuan, which was the low of the day. At that time, retail investors took advantage of the low price to absorb quite strongly, causing the price to rebound. Before long, it rebounded 37 yuan. Qian Dui Ye bought 20 taels from the silverware firm at a price of 3,812 yuan. At that time, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was declining, and buyers were more eager to buy. A certain Jin Hao aggressively absorbed dozens of taels, buying 10 taels from a cash firm at a price of 3,830 yuan. Then, they bought 50 taels from peer firms at 3,835 yuan. Later, the securities firm bought 10 taels from the silverware firm, closing the midday at 3,840 yuan. In the afternoon, because British gold in the foreign exchange market was approaching the 4 shilling mark, the buying sentiment was quite strong. The opening price rose sharply by 40 yuan. A certain Jin Hao bought 10 taels from Qian Dui Ye at a price of 3,880 yuan. At that time, Qian Dui Ye absorbed and bought aggressively, breaking through the 3,900 yuan mark. Qian Dui Ye bought 30 taels from a cash firm at a price of 3,910 yuan. Later, the silverware firm came to sell slightly, and the price fell back temporarily. The silverware firm sold 20 taels to a certain Jin Hao at a price of 3,880 yuan. After that, it was heard that British gold in the foreign exchange market had broken into the 4 shilling mark, and the buying sentiment became even stronger. A certain silver firm and Qian Dui Ye and others competed to aggressively buy, and the price soared another 90 yuan. Qian Dui Ye bought 20 taels from the silverware firm at a price of 3,970 yuan. Later, a certain Jin Hao and the securities firm suddenly sold off at the high price, and the price immediately fell back by 55 yuan. Qian Dui Ye sold 10 taels to Jin Hao at a price of 3,915 yuan. After entering, because the foreign exchange market showed no signs of recovery, it closed at the tightest price of the day. A certain silver firm and retail investors and others started to buy again, and the price rose sharply to 3,970 yuan, the high of the day. After 2:20 PM, because Qian Dui Ye sold off for profit, it fell back slightly. Qian Dui Ye mutually made 20 taels at 3,960 yuan, closing the evening. As a result, it rose another 105 yuan compared to last Saturday, and it has risen for three consecutive rounds, totaling 360 yuan. It was heard that after the close, a certain Qian Dui Ye sold 20 taels to peer firms and another 50 taels to a certain silver firm for profit, both at a price of 3,970 yuan. The entire day fluctuated by 195 yuan. The cash firm's original brand gold was 10 yuan higher than the sycee. The current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, it was rarely heard of being traded.

Jewelry Gold Hangs High at 400 Yuan

Silverware and jewelry gold, the exchange price per tael, was initially still listed at 390 yuan by Da Tong Hang. At 9:30 AM, it listed 5 yuan lower, at 10:00 AM, it returned 5 yuan higher, at 10:15 AM, it listed 5 yuan lower again, at 12:10 PM, it returned 5 yuan higher, at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, it listed 5 yuan higher, at 2:35 PM, it listed 5 yuan higher again. After that, there were no changes. As a result, it increased by 10 yuan. It is estimated that Da Tong Hang changed the listing to 400 yuan, and the new Hang was 398 yuan. The purchase price was generally 20 yuan lower.

### Foreign Currency High Peaks Seen Frequently, British Gold Pound 94.5 Yuan, US Dollar Sells for 98 Yuan

Yesterday, foreign currencies were weak due to the weakening of foreign exchange. The British exchange has broken the four-shilling mark, and the sycee black market is trading at 4,020 yuan. The supply of British and American gold pounds is extremely scarce, and the market is very firm. British and American gold tickets are in even greater demand, and the price is rising sharply. They are rarely circulated in the market and are not easy to obtain. Hong Kong French franc tickets are all regarded as treasures. Canadian tickets and Philippine tickets, etc., are following the sharp rise. Australian gold tickets rose by 3 yuan. The black market is unstable. Foreign currency peaks are appearing in succession. The impact of Japanese gold tickets is quite small. The late market price was 1 yuan, 0.9 points and 2 li. The late market price for Korean tickets was 9 jiao. Trading in the association was not smooth. Qin Tai sold 10 pounds of British gold tickets, Wan Kang sold 50 US dollar tickets, and Yi Kang sold 150 US dollar tickets, all of which were purchased by Sen Tai. Also, Bao Da sold 200 US dollar tickets which were bought by Rentai. Yesterday's market prices: British and American pounds each rose by 1 yuan, British gold tickets rose by 2 yuan, US dollar tickets rose by 0.54 yuan, Hong Kong tickets rose by 0.1 yuan, French franc tickets rose by 0.019 yuan, Singapore tickets rose by 0.1 yuan, Swiss tickets rose by 0.15 yuan, Canadian tickets rose by 0.2 yuan, Philippine tickets rose by 0.3 yuan, Italian tickets rose by 0.02 yuan, Australian gold tickets rose by 3 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Banking Association Notice: Accepting Out-of-Town Banknotes from the China Farmers Bank

Since the city stopped using banknotes with place names from Tianjin, Shandong, Hubei, other out-of-town banknotes have also been refused, and disputes have often occurred in the market. Small money shops and silver shops use the exchange of out-of-town banknotes as a business, and advertise in newspapers. This newspaper argues that the issuing bank should publish a notice in the newspaper stating that they are all universally accepted, and send a letter to the Silver and Money Industries Association to circulate to all banks and shops to accept them uniformly, which is the right way. As reported previously, it is now learned that the Shanghai Banking Association yesterday sent a letter to its member banks, stating that "The China Farmers Bank has requested that the banknotes issued by the bank with the place names of Hangzhou, Xi'an, Fuzhou, Lanzhou, and other places, and the banknotes reprinted by the Hubei Provincial Bank, all be treated as banknotes without place names. Regardless of the amount, they can be exchanged for legal tender at the bank at any time. It is hoped that all member banks in the city will accept them uniformly to facilitate circulation." After the Association circulated the letter, all banks have accepted them. If the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications can also follow the China Farmers Bank's approach, then the circulation of out-of-town banknotes in this city will not be a problem. (M)

### Issue of Stopping Payment on Bank Drafts: A Banker's Perspective

Recently, a dispute arose in Shanghai's financial circles regarding the stopping of payment on bank checks. The incident involved Sheng Kee, which on June 29th, using a check drawn by the American Light Company, a depositor at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, for an immediate national currency amount of 70,000 yuan, sought to convert it into cash at the bank. The bank issued a bank draft No. 509981 for the same amount, which Sheng Kee entrusted to a bank on June 30th to collect funds from the Bankers' Association Clearing House. Unexpectedly, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank instructed to stop payment. Sheng Kee argued that the bank draft, issued by the bank, circulated in the market and was regarded as cash. Since its common use, there had been no instance of the issuing bank unilaterally stopping payment. When questioned, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank's response, as reported in the newspapers, stated, "Regarding the matter of stopping payment on bank draft No. 509981 drawn by the American Light Dyeing Factory, this bank has clearly responded on July 7th and the three days prior." Concerning the matter of negotiable instrument credit, inquiries were made to a certain banker, who stated, "Regarding the Zhejiang Industrial Bank's stopping of payment on the check, I have only read about it in the newspapers and am unclear about the details. This is a matter between the two parties, but from a negotiable instrument perspective, a bank draft is a check drawn by various banks on the Bankers' Association Clearing House, equivalent to a bank's own draft. It is a type of unconditional payment security, a negotiable instrument for clearing between financial institutions. It is now widely circulated in the city, being transferred and accepted, and enjoys considerable public trust and popularity. Furthermore, the regulations of the city's banking industry stipulate that 'stopping payment on a bank draft due to loss is limited to cases of fire, theft, or loss in transit.' This matter has already attracted attention from all sectors and is somewhat related to all banks. I believe the truth will soon be revealed to clarify the real reason for stopping payment." (N)

### Discount Rate Fluctuations Stabilize

Yesterday, the fluctuation range of the discount rate for remittances narrowed. In the morning, it initially rose slightly to the 200 yuan mark per thousand, but by late morning, it had fallen back to 195 yuan. In the afternoon, it was even more stable, remaining at 195 yuan, the same as the final price on the previous Saturday. The interbank lending rate announced by the Money Trade Association remained unchanged at 2 jiao for both the morning and afternoon sessions.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Flicker, Foreign Stocks Reach New Highs, Beining Railway Bonds Paid with Principal and Interest

The unofficial securities market was flickering and uncertain yesterday, and sentiment remained somewhat uneasy. According to newspaper reports, the British and American fleets plan to head to the Far East to blockade Japan, which should cause market prices to rise. Furthermore, there is talk that interest on national salvation bonds will continue to be paid in legal tender. The government's determination to maintain public bonds is evident in this. News of British, American, and French support for legal tender and loans continued to circulate, so the market initially showed signs of rising. However, due to abundant floating shares and sales related to special interests, it suffered setbacks again. The trend indicates that after three consecutive days of declines, the decrease has narrowed to about 3 yuan, and the future should improve. Yesterday, numbers 11 and 35 were initially bought and rose, with Type C reaching over 2 yuan. Subsequently, number 38 was vigorously sold off in large quantities, causing a slight turnaround to be unexpectedly thwarted by numbers 49 and Yongkang, which were also sold off in large quantities, further weakening market prices. On the buying side, Tian Sheng bought in a forward-looking manner, absorbing numbers 11 and 35 at lower prices. Dingkang and Yizhong also made considerable purchases, and retail investors generally bought less and sold more. As a result, the price increased slightly by 1 jiao, reaching 7 jiao. The total turnover was approximately 800,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below.

Stock trading involved many asking prices but few successful transactions. Although the results were similar, there were no settlements.

The General Chamber of Commerce reported that due to further tightening of foreign exchange, the rubber stock market was unusually firm. The prices of most stocks reached new highs. Sellers believed that if foreign exchange continued to tighten at the current prices, they could continue to rise, so they all held back and stopped selling. Industrial stocks were calm but somewhat sluggish.

Reuters Telegraphic Dispatch from London: The 1899 Imperial Railways of North China Loan, commonly known as the Beining Railway 5% bonds, the 35th drawing for redemption of principal, was held in June of this year. The principal to be redeemed is 57,500 British pounds, and the 80th interest coupon, totaling 8,625 British pounds, both totaling 66,125 British pounds, matured on the 1st of this month and have been announced for payment by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in London.

### China National Products Company to Increase Capital by 200,000 Yuan

The China National Products Company, according to a resolution passed at a shareholders' extraordinary meeting the day before yesterday, will increase its new capital by 200,000 yuan in national currency. Together with the original capital of 400,000 yuan in national currency, the total capital will be 600,000 yuan in national currency. 50,000 yuan will be allocated from the profits of the company's Changsha branch and distributed evenly to the old shareholders. The remaining amount will be supplemented by the old shareholders in proportion to their old shares, with each two old shares carrying the right to subscribe for one new share. The deadline is September 30th.

### Grain: Who is Responsible for Today's Rice Market? Readers Can Judge for Themselves; Resolution is Expected Soon

Following Du Lai's advice to fellow rice merchants to trade within the limits and avoid private transactions, he also announced in the market yesterday: The Shanghai Municipal Council has set the price limit at 20 yuan for Japonica rice and 16 yuan for Indica rice, but private transactions have become an open secret. It is impossible to purchase goods within the limits, and exceeding the limits is illegal, placing us in a difficult situation. Fellow merchants should abide by the price limits for the best, etc. Therefore, the rice market was again in a standstill yesterday. The only transactions made were for Leli Dongshuang at 21 yuan, local glutinous rice at 24.5 yuan, foreign glutinous rice at 23 yuan, high-grade Indica rice at 16 yuan, and low-grade rice at 16 yuan. The exact amount of rice stored in Shanghai is unknown, but the quantity of goods purchased before the price limits must be very large. Selling Japonica rice at the limit price of 20 yuan and high-grade Indica rice at 16 yuan in the retail market should be sufficient to meet demand. Therefore, the price limits set by the Shanghai Municipal Council are well-founded, and the difficulty felt by large mills is their inability to fulfill their desires.

Small rice shops are facing great difficulties. Since the population of the foreign concessions has increased from sparse to dense and the prices of various food items have risen from cheap to expensive, rice shops have also flourished with the rapid increase in population and the development of the market. However, business has become quite difficult recently, because their capital is meager. Usually, their retail transactions involve only repeated buying and selling, with goods entering and leaving quickly. The inventory in the shop is usually no more than 60 or 70 shi, which can only last for 10 or 8 days. In the current environment, it is impossible to purchase goods at the limit price, which means there are no goods to sell to the market, causing customers to go elsewhere and forcing them to close their doors. To maintain their livelihoods, the only option is to purchase goods through private transactions outside the market. This involves taking risks, so small and large merchants, although both subject to the price limits, experience uneven levels of hardship.

Rice merchants, on the other hand, speak official jargon, claiming that they only act as intermediaries, earning commissions, and that most of the goods they held have been sold off. The current inventory in warehouses is held by general non-industry speculators. They have completely absolved themselves of responsibility and claim that they cannot do business and can only stop operating. Therefore, the market has become desolate in recent days.

Customers also have their own perspective, believing that they specialize in transportation to make a living. Once the goods are assembled, they can be sold off. Speculation and hoarding are only possible for those with large capital and sufficient strength. With meager capital, they cannot hold out for long. When they are forced to, they will sell off even at a loss. For example, the current price of southern goods from the interior is 19 yuan (some say 18 yuan). Adding transportation costs, taxes, miscellaneous fees, and commissions of 2.3 yuan, the cost to Shanghai is 21.3 yuan. Adding commission again, they must sell at 21.5 yuan. However, the current price limit is 20 yuan, so how can they sell off? Therefore, they are all reluctantly withholding samples and waiting for the situation to change. If they cannot hold out, they will have to sell.

The rise in rice prices is due to the strong power of hoarders, who are unwilling to sell even as prices rise. Their power is strong precisely because they are supported by the financial sector. It is rumored that the financial sector provides loans for hoarding rice at 80% of its value. Therefore, one investment of capital is used multiple times. As rice hoarding continues, rice prices are unlikely to ease. Therefore, the public is indirectly benefiting from the financial industry's high-priced rice.

The future trend seems to be easing. For example, the rice arriving yesterday included more than 1,000 bags of Songjiang and Nangang early and late rice, 26 carloads of Baobaozi and Fengjing goods, which were not sampled. Furthermore, it is rumored that Wuhu has implemented the lifting of the ban, and the first batch of goods is being loaded for export, said to be more than 5,000 bags. If this news is true, the chaotic market is expected to be clarified and return to normal, and the people of Shanghai will no longer have to fear for their food supply. Furthermore, new crops are approaching in various regions. For example, if the weather is good in Wuhu, the early Indica rice is said to be available in ten days. New rice from Pudong has been hindered by transportation difficulties, so only the first batch has arrived without any subsequent shipments. However, this isolation will certainly not last long.

The official market for guest Indica rice remained small yesterday, because machine-milled Indica rice and high-grade Indica rice were both above the 16-yuan limit price. Therefore, the market was decorated with medium-grade and low-grade Indica rice, old machine-milled rice, and brown rice. In the afternoon, it was rumored that Wuhu would lift the ban within a week, so guest hoarders were slightly more willing to sell. Total transactions were nearly 2,000 bags.

Importers of foreign rice continue to hold back, and the market is extremely quiet. However, it is rumored that rice merchants have suggested to the concession authorities that they purchase and supply rice to stabilize prices in Shanghai. While this is beneficial to the future of the people's food supply, it also has drawbacks. With the current exchange rate for merchants to enter the customs, no matter how low the original price of foreign rice is, the price in legal tender will be extremely high. Therefore, rice merchants will justify raising prices, claiming that even foreign rice is so expensive, so the price of domestic rice is justified. In this way, residents will suffer the hidden pain of price increases before benefiting from the actual stability of rice prices. Therefore, this issue must be carefully reviewed when ordering rice.

### Flour and Wheat Rise Again

Flour: Yesterday, the price of No. 2 flour from the factory rose again by 2 jiao, reaching a spot price of 5.5 yuan. Due to repeated increases in the price of wheat raw materials, factories have little flour in stock. In addition to supplying small wholesale transactions within the street, they continue to restrict large-volume sales to out-of-town merchants. The total transaction volume was small, totaling 40,000 to 50,000 bags including local and out-of-town merchants. It is rumored that recalled goods are also increasing simultaneously with factory prices. Brokers and customers are both seeking to purchase flour, but the floating stock on the market is depleted, and the market is unusually firm. 20,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Tanggu today.

Wheat: Yesterday, the wheat market experienced an even more intense price surge. Recently, prices in Changzhou, Wuxi, and other places have soared. Furthermore, factories have long found it difficult to accept foreign wheat prices, so the demand for local wheat is increasing. Hoarders are also greedy, and suppliers are taking the opportunity to hold up the market. Moreover, the gold market is rising sharply, and sentiment is extremely bullish. The market has seen unprecedented surge. A total of 38 carloads of wheat from Changzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Guantian were sold, including 22 carloads from the Fuxin Factory, 6 carloads from the Fufeng Factory, and more than 10 carloads from hoarders. The highest price was 7.8 yuan, and 7.5 to 7.2 yuan, up 4, 5, and 6 jiao. Furthermore, 480 bags of food-grade beans are being shipped to Tanggu today.

### Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Prices Rise Formidably, Jin Cheng Already at 700 Yuan

The yarn market continued to rise, and the price surge remained strong. This is because merchants from South China and Hong Kong are actively purchasing, and sentiment is strong. Merchants from the interior have long stopped purchasing domestic yarn, but recently, the prices of unpopular yarns are relatively cheap, and ready-made goods are available. Sales of 20-count Xing Shi and Wu Zi yarns are brisk, and selling prices have therefore increased. As for popular yarns, the surge in prices for 20-count Te Jin Cheng is astonishing, reaching a high of 700 yuan. 20-count Shuang Ma has reached 620 yuan. The severity of this price surge is truly unknown.

Spot yarn opened relatively flat. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma foreign warehouse was 604 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 591 yuan, similar to the previous day. Shortly thereafter, the market suddenly became tense, and buying intensified, saying that foreign exchange had shrunk slightly and gold had risen slightly. The yarn market then jumped up more than ten yuan in an instant. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma foreign warehouse continued to rise to 620 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 598 yuan. It was found that 1,075 bales were traded in half a day, compared to 160 bales traded on the previous day. The market price of 20-count Shuang Ma rose by 17 yuan, Te Jin Cheng rose by 25 yuan, and Mu Yang rose by 2 yuan. The purchase amounts for each merchant are listed on the left.

Hong Kong 540 Ningbo 40

Wenzhou 20 Yunnan 10

Interior 90 Peers 375

Total 1,075

Japanese yarn opened with an upward trend. The price of 20-count Yue Qin for this month was 477 yuan. It suddenly fell by 5 yuan shortly thereafter. Subsequently, as local yarn rose sharply, it was also drawn into a favorable situation, returning to 480 yuan. The closing price was around 478 yuan, but actual demand was average, and hoarders were numerous.

### Fellow Merchants' Stocks Nearly Exhausted, Indian Cotton Rises Again by 3-4 Yuan

Transactions of local cotton have been cut off, but in reality, factories are all accepting it. However, due to the depletion of inventory, transactions are difficult to come by. However, Japanese factories are keenly collecting Indian cotton and purchasing large quantities. It is said that they are shipping it to Qingdao, so recently, the stocks of fellow merchants have been completely bought out, because their selling prices are 20 yuan cheaper than the prices offered by foreign firms, which is relatively much cheaper. Purchases continue unabated. Transactions have decreased slightly, because the stocks of each firm have mostly been sold out. Market prices have risen again by 3 to 4 yuan. 350 bales of Tongzhou cotton from Northern Jiangsu have arrived. The current prices of spot cotton are recorded on the left.

Kelaina 29.0 Peers 500 pieces

Laigonghua 23.0 Peers 200 pieces

Huitongdeng 126.5 Peers 200 pieces

Second Pengjiapu 124.5 Peers 200 pieces

Bailuoqu 210.0 Peers 200 pieces

More Indian cotton has been shipped. The British Company's ship Somali, which came from London via Mumbai, loaded 1,200 pieces of cotton. The ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai today and will dock at Qichang West Wharf in Pudong for unloading.

Another report: Due to further tightening of foreign exchange yesterday, the stock of cotton in Shanghai is dwindling. Therefore, selling prices have surged, but transactions among fellow merchants have become lively. Pingguoer has seen new highs above 100 yuan. The cotton in the Wood Market has almost been completely purchased by Japanese factories. The selling prices of spot and futures are approaching each other. Once the stocks of each firm are sold out, they will order from foreign firms, so it is expected that the day of prosperity for foreign cotton is not far away.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market was unusually quiet yesterday. Selling prices did not change at the opening. Later, a portion of the bulls took profits, down 2 or 3 points, but most merchants maintained a wait-and-see attitude and planned to decide on their business strategy after the government's cotton production estimate was released. Therefore, closing prices were unusually calm, up or down 1 or 2 points. Indian combined predictions fell 25 rupees, and the Egyptian market was closed.

### Piece Goods: Dong Pi White Goods Rise Excessively, Market Suspends Futures Trading, Prices of Chinese Factory Colored Cloth Chaotic, Tightening Foreign Exchange Doubles Exports

Domestic Cloth: The morning opening was slightly firm. White fine cloth and fine twill rose by 2 jiao per piece. Wholesale shops on the street had the intention to purchase at a lower price. Guangdong merchants also continued to purchase colored twill. In the afternoon, with the British exchange rate within 4 points, hoarders were active, and cloth prices increased. Fine cloth and fine twill rose by another 2 or 3 jiao per piece, heavy coarse cloth and coarse twill rose by 5 jiao, and light cloth rose by 2 jiao. Colored cloth prices were chaotic, lacking a definite market. On the street, 400 to 500 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, woolen cloth, serge, velvet, and other goods were traded. Guangdong merchants purchased more than 100 boxes of colored twill, and Ningbo merchants purchased 50 to 60 boxes of colored twill, bleached cloth, and blue cloth. Due to exchange rate factors, exports to Hong Kong, Singapore, and Siam increased significantly, and yesterday, more than 4,000 pieces of fine twill, bleached cloth, bleached twill, and red ocean labels were purchased.

Dong Pi: New highs for white goods emerge endlessly. Yesterday, 12-pound Long Tou fine cloth for next month's futures was sold by the Ito Company for 18 yuan per piece. Dong Mian Company opened the price of San Tao fine cloth for this month at 16.5 yuan per piece. More than 200 pieces were ordered in total. There is a shortage of spot fine cloth chips on the market, so transactions are not brisk. Long Tou spot price is 17.5 yuan, and this month is 17.75 yuan, up 5 jiao compared to last week. The white goods market, in view of the excessive rise, in order to prevent future risks, yesterday specially notified fellow merchants that from today onwards, new futures trading will be suspended, and only spot goods will be allowed to be bought and sold. Futures that have been done before should be settled by both buyers and sellers themselves. Therefore, yesterday's market's speculative minds were restrained.

### The Philosophy of Closing Windows

— Bai Ying

Recently, the scope of women's articles seems to be getting narrower and narrower. My heart is heavy, and my pen is heavy. Although there is absolutely no reason to be pessimistic and disappointed in such an environment, the fact that I no longer have a lighthearted mood may be true. For those who value material enjoyment more than spiritual life, as long as they still have money and do not need to "cross the bridge to the north," they will not painfully feel the darkness of their current lives. High commodity prices will not affect the rich. Even if the price of "Beauty" brand ice cream rises again, it will certainly not cause a "ice cream grabbing" craze. In short, we do not want to consider people who are not directly related to the seven necessities of life. These people may also have spiritual lives, but they probably do not go beyond the circles of dance halls and swimming pools.

The generation who stay in Shanghai who feel the most pain are those who are struggling to eat but still demand some spiritual food. At one time, this generation was the so-called petty bourgeoisie. Although the petty bourgeoisie is said to have no real class foundation, this generation is undoubtedly the backbone of society in every modern country. If you examine the central technical personnel and organizational leaders in various aspects of society, all of them belong to this class. Therefore, the current living conditions of this generation should be noted by everyone who cares about social issues.

According to my personal observation, material life is certainly important to this generation, but spiritual life affects them far more than material life. It is said that the most universally accepted slogan during the Soviet revolution was "Land, bread, and freedom." If land represents the demands of farmers and bread represents the demands of workers, then freedom expresses the spiritual demands of the petty bourgeoisie.

The reason why we feel heavy pressure on our hearts today is probably because we are losing our freedom. The increasingly tight atmosphere of darkness has made us feel suffocated. But what makes us most painful is that in this situation, there is still a generation of people who consider themselves "wise" who are automatically closing the few windows that remain!

Interpreting the ancient saying "protect oneself wisely" only as opportunism is equivalent to prolonging one's life, and it will never protect anything other than a dog's life!

We do not need to make demands that exceed objective conditions, but using "environmentalism" to trap oneself is the most foolish strategy.

"Give me liberty, or give me death!" We should firmly remember and practice this saying, especially everyone who works in the field of spiritual life.

When others build walls, we tear down houses. When others demand to close doors, we should respond by opening large windows, not closing windows! Technique is a problem, but never forget the principle.

### German Labor Camps (Part 1)

— Translated by Mou Zhou

Three years ago, I was also a prisoner who was punished to do hard labor in the swamps. Just two or three weeks ago, my friend left the labor camp in the Ems River Marshland (a type of prison specially established after the German National Socialist Party came to power, where the prisoners detained were mostly political prisoners - translator). As he described his experiences, the wilderness of Esterwege and Neusustrum reappeared before me.

Near the end of 1936, news leaked into the penitentiary that batches of prisoners would be escorted to the swamps again. No one wanted to go. Therefore, some prisoners dripped indelible black lead solutions into their eyes, wanting to cause inflammation or even blindness. Some used a needle to pierce dirty gauze threads through their palms, wanting to cause blood poisoning. They would rather go blind early or be sent to the hospital than go to the swamps.

The "political prisoners" were very proud, and they were unwilling to take such passive measures. I spent three years in the penitentiary, and I never heard political prisoners attempt suicide.

On April 14, 1937, the penitentiary authorities gathered the prisoners and escorted one hundred of them - two-thirds of whom were political prisoners - to the train station. By the morning of the second day, after an eighteen-hour journey, the train arrived at Doersen station. On the platform, the guards of the labor camp were waiting for their prisoners with mounted bayonets. A little further away, "swamp trains" - special trains connecting various labor camps - were parked. As soon as the train doors opened, the guards grabbed the prisoners and beat them with their gun butts, saying, "Swine! Turtles! Get on the freight cars!"

By 1937, roads and permanent railways had been laid in the swamps. In March of 1935, when I boarded the "swamp train," it still carried me through pathless, humid wilderness. However, the bestial treatment of prisoners had not changed.

Suddenly, a gust of wind blew across the swamp, and it started to rain. In two or three minutes, the prisoners were soaked. Suddenly, a rude command echoed in the air: "Kneel! Those who are still standing will be shot!" This was the voice of Commander Willi Bertram. There was almost no room to stand on the train, let alone kneel. Before the prisoners could figure out what they should do, bullets were already whistling over their heads.

The train stopped two or three yards away from the camp. On the way to the camp, there were guard towers with machine guns and electric fences. "Line up! In two rows!" The guards ran beside the prisoners, bumping them with their gun butts.

When the prisoners arrived in the camp's courtyard, the guards' faces showed the joy of sadists. Two adjutants - August Dickmeier and Helmuth Meier - oversaw the prisoners. They formed the prisoners into teams, and each person received a number and a number in the barrack. This took three hours. Talking was strictly forbidden, and leaving the ranks was also forbidden. One prisoner could not bear it and moved slightly away from the line. Helmuth Meier grabbed him, punched and kicked him with his elbows, and then ordered him to run around the barracks pushing a cart loaded with yellow sand, until he was exhausted and died.

The officer who registered the prisoners' resumes was a round-faced, chubby eccentric. My friend's turn came. "Why are you here?" he was asked. The guard stared sharply at his lips. "For pol..." Before he could finish, he was punched heavily in the face. All political prisoners received the same treatment. Criminal prisoners, however, were spared.

After several hours, the registration process finally came to an end. The prisoners were driven into the barracks. As soon as they arrived at their dormitories, the siren sounded: "Go to the courtyard to listen to roll call!" This was repeated several times. At five thirty, the food was brought out, but the prisoners were ordered to go to bed.

Even so, the "welcome ceremony" to thwart the prisoners' courage was not over. In the middle of the night, the sound of leather boots could be heard in the dormitory. Then came a drunken roar: "Swine, you will never leave here alive. We will shoot you and use your corpses as fertilizer for the swamp." The frightened prisoners kept silent in their beds. "You little cowards," the drunken voice continued, "Now, you are pale, you have lost your vascular nerves!" Afterwards, the guards picked up their whips and lashed the prisoners.

In the morning, the prisoners were awakened at four thirty. Before breakfast, the adjutant came in to check the beds. The straw mattresses had to be laid out in a rectangular shape, like the rectangle of a cigar box. Those prisoners whose beds could not satisfy the aesthetic views of the guards would suffer bad luck. At six o'clock, the work began.

### Repeating Past Mistakes

— (Translated from the "Zi Lin Bao")

### Talking About Cows

— Chen Youqin

Domestic Cows and Wild Cows

Mr. Ye Chucang wrote an article several years ago titled "The Awakening of the Cow," which is still included in the Chinese textbooks and used as teaching material. The article is quite long and mainly tells the story of the farm cow of farmer Yuan Laofu in Suzhou, who, due to mistreatment, initiated a general strike with the sickle, plow, rake, mud grab, etc. The cow became the leader of the alliance. As a result, the farmer Laofu used the sickles and other farming tools to deal with the cows, and the cows, unable to endure the hunger, finally surrendered. The cow himself gave a grand speech, blaming his companions for three reasons: first, lack of mutual support in living; second, lack of determination to sacrifice; and third, lack of complete organizational awareness. Therefore, the result could only be failure.

This tragic failure is the inevitable fate of domestic cows because they depend on people for their fodder. The mutual support in living that Mr. Ye mentioned is easier said than done. Not to mention cows, even humans, who are known as the most intelligent of all creatures, have not achieved it, have they? As for the determination to sacrifice and complete organizational awareness, these are even more difficult. If these three difficulties could be overcome, I think today would already be the era of cows as masters of the world; the one holding the reins would not be a human, but the cow itself.

Cows stand in opposition to humans. If they could break free from human homes, not be attached to the fodder that people give them, and return to the life of wild cows, they would surely achieve victory.

I happened to see in the "Science and Life" column of the Shen Bao supplement three "Scientific Liaozhai" stories by Mr. He Shan. The third story said, "Darwin also said that wild bison can help each other defend against enemies. Whenever they encounter a wolf invasion, they always place their young in the center of the herd, and the old cows always use their heads to bear the brunt, making angry expressions, and using the horns of their heads as weapons to resist the enemy, forming a forest of spears. The wolves fear their strength, knowing that approaching will inevitably lead to misfortune. Although they are eager to attack, they hesitate and do not succeed."

Wild cows have the determination to sacrifice; otherwise, they would not dare to be enemies with wolves. Wild cows have complete organizational awareness; "bearing the brunt" and "forming a forest of spears" are not expressions of complete organization? Wild cows also have mutual support in living; they nurture and defend themselves and can also protect their future generations, placing the young in the center to prevent them from being seized by the enemy. Not only should domestic cows feel ashamed of this, but we humans should also feel ashamed of this, shouldn't we?

Whipping Cow Backs and Burning Cow Tails

Those who issue orders and instruct cows are adults. Cows should do hard work, and people should also do hard work. If people only whip cows to work and are unwilling to endure hardship themselves, that is not acceptable. If cows are tired, they should be whipped, but if people are tired, they are not whipped, that is not fair.

"Dong Zhi Gao Miscellaneous Records" contains a very meaningful passage:

Fei Xiu and Huang 　were friends despite their age difference. One day, they walked together along the Wan River and saw someone driving a firewood cart down the embankment. The mud was deep, and the cow was tired, being whipped incessantly. Xiu tried to stop the whipper, but Ye immediately said, "You must beat it harder; when the two-legged ones can't persuade the four-legged ones, it's good to beat them if they don't want to move."

Here, "two-legged ones" refers to people, and "four-legged ones" refers to cows. If the four-legged cow is tired, it should be beaten harder, but if the two-legged person is tired and "unwilling to move," if you don't use the whip to beat them, they will always be tired because people are much lazier than cows. If you don't believe it, look at the people who are violently whipping the backs of cows, sitting high on the firewood cart. They are unwilling to walk at all because they are afraid that the mud under the embankment is difficult to walk on. Instead, they add their own weight to the cow's body. Do they ever carry some of the firewood to reduce the cow's burden?

According to what Pei and Huang saw and discussed, they did not tell us the outcome of the event. Did the firewood cart escape the deep mud? Did it overcome the difficulty?

I think that, in addition to the driver taking some of the weight to carry on their back, if the cow is still tired and unwilling to move forward, then you can only burn the cow's tail (because whipping has become ineffective). Imitate the story of Tian Dan's fire bull formation. When the cow's tail is burned, it will surely jump and rush forward, running out of the deep mud.

However, the cow may not be willing to stop in the mud and refuse to move forward. Burning the tail is a last resort, to be done only when absolutely necessary. If Tian Dan had not been trapped in the city of Jimo and unable to save himself, he would not have casually deployed the fire bull formation, would he?

The most important thing is to whip the person driving the firewood cart. "When the two-legged ones can't persuade the four-legged ones, it's good to beat them if they don't want to move" is indeed a famous saying.

### Three or Four Things About Actors

### Gong Jianong

Editor's Note: Jianong is a veteran member of the Star Film Company, with refined and experienced acting skills as his only specialty. He has acted in films for over ten years, accounting for more than half of all Star productions. He is extremely rich in acting experience. This article is based on the actor's perspective and offers very insightful views, which every actor should recognize.

Since dedicating myself to film, it has been more than ten years without realizing it. Based on my past experience from an actor's perspective, I believe that the concept of an actor should be seen as an artist with a certain amount of creativity and life, and should not be regarded as a mere simple and mechanical tool of the director. Because the actor's performance is not only a means by which the director achieves his goals, but in reality, the performance itself is a creative and living art.

Actors not only serve the screenwriter and director in art, but also serve society like the screenwriter and director. Moreover, actors should also have a correct understanding of society, and the depth of this understanding is directly proportional to the height of their artistic achievement.

Actors should have a correct understanding of society as a foundation, so that they can fully develop their acting skills in their entire performing life and in their service to society. Because the characters in a play, whether important or not, their thoughts, emotions, actions, and various habits are directly or indirectly determined by the social life in which they live. Without understanding this, the actor's performance is at most a vulgar, superficial, and lifeless imitation, and sometimes it may even be completely wrong. Therefore, understanding society is the key to understanding the character and determining the character's performance.

Not only should actors fully understand the role they play, but they should also fully understand the theme of the play and the other parts that contribute to that theme. In other words, they should study the entire play and gain a complete and thorough understanding.

As for those who only let actors know their role, or even only let actors understand a certain scene in isolation, this is not allowed for actors who are social artists. Because there are many unfavorable situations in this case:

(1) Eliminates the actor's creative and concrete performance - an actor has a close relationship with the entire play. If an actor does not understand his relationship with other actors in a play, does not understand the relationship and effect between scenes in an act, that is, does not understand the theme and development of the entire play, then this actor can hardly perform well, even in a lifeless, imitative, and vulgar way. What creative performance is there?

(2) Destroys the overall effect of the entire play - if an actor only knows his role or only understands a certain scene, it will affect other actors, and as a result, the entire play will become loose, because the actor's performance and effect are connected to the performance and effect of other actors.

(3) Eliminates the actor's personality - if an actor cannot fully understand the entire play, and therefore cannot understand the role he plays, and thus cannot make a creative and concrete performance of his role, then he will not be able to fully and appropriately develop his personality in his performance, and may even make his personality disappear.

(4) Makes it impossible for the actor to fully understand the role he plays - an actor playing a character in a play is performing in cooperation with other actors in various parts, and the actor's performance or the character's performance has a close relationship with the entire play. If this actor does not understand the entire play, then he will definitely not be able to fully understand the role he plays.

Therefore, for a play to succeed, it is necessary for the actor to have a full and deep understanding of the entire play, and this full understanding of the entire play and the ability to portray the personality of a certain character are based on his deep understanding of the society in which he lives.

In current and future films and dramas, actors who can grasp a certain social consciousness and emotion are not just simple mechanical tools of the director but are actors with their own inherent creativity. Only such actors can jointly advance the art of film and the art of drama with other personnel.

These are some very superficial and foolish opinions I have based on my usual observations in the actor's job.

### Prelude to Yang Baosen's Arrival in Shanghai

— Aiping Room Owner

As the intense summer heat gradually dissipates, the theaters in Shanghai are about to revive. The Golden Grand Theater has always been known for its reasonable ticket prices. For its autumn opening, it has already invited Song Dezhu, a talented flower actress from a drama school in the former capital, and Yang Baosen, a famous dragon-bearded Sheng actor of the Yu school. Among these two, Yang has performed in Shanghai before, and his art is well known to all sectors of the city. Song, on the other hand, is coming to Shanghai for the first time and is a new figure in the art world.

Regarding everything about Dezhu, I have already written about it in this newspaper at the beginning of last month, so I will not repeat it here. What I want to talk about now is about Baosen.

Baosen is from northern Anhui, and he is the grandson of the famous flower actress Yang Guiyun (Baoxian). He is thirty-one years old this year. He is amiable and approachable, and has no theatrical airs at all. His art was taught by the famous teacher Chen Xiuhua. He was famous in his youth, and his singing and acting style follow the style of Shu Yan, gaining a good understanding of the subtleties. Shu Yan himself once praised him as his successor. He has a lot of repertoire. He is especially well-known and praised for plays such as "Empty City Stratagem," "Baochen Banquet," "Catching and Releasing Cao," "Zhulian Village," "Nanyang Pass," and "Wulong Court."

Baosen's singing and acting style follow the style of Shu Yan. Therefore, in all his performances, he strives to maintain the traditional rules without following any fashionable trends. The depth of his skills is obvious to all. Therefore, famous actors such as Xiao Cuihua, Zhang Eyun, and Mao Shilai are all happy to cooperate with him to achieve the effect of peonies and green leaves.

It is impossible to fully describe all the advantages of Baosen's stage performances in just a few words. Briefly speaking, his demeanor can be described as "calm and relaxed." He does not change his demeanor from beginning to end. His recitations are not as loose as Fu Ying's, and his acting style is more pure and natural than Fu Ying's. His appearance has a scholarly air, which is rare among ordinary Sheng actors.

Baosen's reputation declined in the past due to his addiction. Later, he revitalized himself, eliminated all things harmful to his body and mind, and regained his former glory by performing with Xiao Cuihua. His recent collaboration with Eyun showed even more progress than before, and his reputation is likely to surpass what it was in the past. He performed the highlight play "Si Lang Visits His Mother" several times in Shanghai. The "diao mao," "shui fa," and "ga diao" were all extremely wonderful. His energy was full, and his voice was clear and melodious, which was greatly appreciated by the audience. This time, Dezhu is coming south, and Baosen is also coming with her to perform together, which will be even better than before. This can be predicted.

### Mei Ehui in "Shanghai Nights"

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

If they happen to meet a good-natured boss, they will agree to the actors' requests, and things will seem peaceful in the short term. However, people's desires are hard to fill. After only a few days, the actors will ask for more money. Even if the theater owner is easy to talk to, he will not be able to stand it at this point, and the result will inevitably be a breakdown in the relationship between the two parties. There is also a kind of stubborn and unreasonable theater owner who, no matter how famous an actor is and how much money he earns for him, will not even consider raising his salary. If you try to reason with him gently, he has gentle ways of dealing with you; if you use a tough approach, he has tough methods. As the saying goes, "Even a strong dragon cannot suppress a local snake." No matter how good the relationship is between the actors from out of town, it is very difficult for them to beat the locals. Therefore, their relationship cannot always be harmonious.

Based on the two reasons mentioned above, it can be seen that once an actor has been singing in a certain place for a long time, a rift will develop with the theater owner, and he will want to leave this place and join a new troupe as soon as possible. If someone happens to come and invite him, this is exactly what he wants, a happy and quick decision. It is always better than joining a troupe on his own initiative. The talent scouts are all veterans in the opera troupes and have already figured out this kind of psychology of the actors. They will watch the play for several days in a row and will become very familiar with a certain actor. According to insiders, talent scouts all have a secret signal, and the actors who often travel around also understand these gestures. Once the two sides have tacitly agreed, when the play ends, the actor will instruct his assistant to secretly follow behind the talent scout. Once they arrive at their residence, they can say what they want to say. After several talks, the conditions are agreed upon. Then, a deposit is paid, and a plan for eloping is made. Fortunately, there is no trouble with carrying costumes. All they have to do is pack the things mentioned above into a small bundle in advance (as for the weapons that the martial arts actors use, they have to be sacrificed).

### Doting Wife and Intimate Friend

— Qi Hua

"Doting Wife and Intimate Friend" and "Wife, Doctor and Nurse" are comedies of the same type. The leading actors Warner Baxter and Loretta Young are also old "regulars." However, the nurse Virginia Bruce is now replaced by Binnie Barnes as the intimate friend.

The love scandals of male and female stars in Hollywood often cause a stir. By the time a film magazine crosses the Pacific Ocean and arrives in Shanghai, some of the fiery reports are already history. Therefore, scripts like "Doting Wife and Intimate Friend," at least reflect the general trend of their love life in an objective way.

The director's skills are worth learning. Like "Three Variations on the Plum Blossom," which premiered last week, every character and every scene can clearly portray their personality and are handled in a lively and moving way, so that the audience under the screen cannot help but laugh involuntarily.

Warner Baxter is an architect who hates his wife's singing. Loretta Young does not realize that her singing voice is not pleasing and constantly makes strange noises. The director writes this mismatched couple in a very interesting way. The characters surrounding them, such as Loretta Young's parents and singing teacher, are also written in a very delicate and thoughtful way.

There are many wonderful scenes in the whole film. For example, Warner Baxter's first encounter with Binnie Barnes, Binnie Barnes discovers his singing voice and advises him to practice singing; Warner Baxter returns from a performance and rushes to his wife's bedside, their soft words, their hugs, are all very moving. In the end, after Loretta Young leaves, Warner Baxter is flustered and does not know what to do when he goes on stage, causing many jokes and creating a commotion in the audience. Loretta Young happens to be in the audience, rushes to the backstage, and the couple reconciles. Although this scene consistently gives us many laughs, Warner Baxter's pain is still revealed behind the laughter, moving people's hearts.

Among the actors, Warner Baxter plays a good role. The anxiety when disturbed by the singing, the embarrassment when he first goes on stage, the pain after his wife leaves, and the remorse in the backstage can all be clearly analyzed on his facial expressions. Loretta Young's coquettishness and Binnie Barnes's charming appearance are also lovely.
