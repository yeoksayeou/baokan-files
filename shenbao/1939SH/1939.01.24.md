### Defend Spain!

Under the joint fierce attack of the Nationalist army and the Italian-German fascists, and under the illegal blockade of the hypocritical international "non-intervention" policy, the Spanish people's war against fascism has reached a very serious juncture. According to Reuters, the Spanish Nationalist army has been advancing continuously in recent days and is now only twenty miles from Barcelona. The Spanish people are fighting a bloody battle, desperately blocking the enemy's advance; in every corner of the world, the cries of "Aid Spain!" "Arms to Spain!" "Stop Germany and Italy!" are reverberating.

Spain is a bastion of peace in Europe and even the world, and it must be defended to the end. If Spain falls into the hands of the fascists, the consequences will not only affect Spain, nor only Europe, but also world peace.

First of all, if Spain falls into enemy hands, France will suffer a fatal blow; a large fascist army will appear outside the Pyrenees; France's connection with its African colonies will be cut off, and Mussolini can easily seize France's colonies; cooperation between Britain and France will also be cut off.

Secondly, if Spain falls into enemy hands, Britain will also encounter an unprecedentedly serious threat: because in this way, it will become a base for Germany and Italy in the southwest corner of Europe, from which they can attack Britain; it can control Gibraltar, cutting off Britain's connection with its lifeline, the Mediterranean; it can become a German stronghold for attacking Peot...

In a word, if the German-Italian adventure in Spain succeeds, they can turn from Central Europe to Western Europe; from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic; from Europe to Africa; their targets will not only be small countries, but also include large countries; not only Europe, but also Africa and Latin America.

Attacking Spain is the first joint attack of the German-Italian fascists; the Spanish people's fight against the German-Italian fascists is also defending world peace. Therefore, on this day of life-and-death struggle in Spain, breaking through the shackles of "non-intervention" and greatly aiding Spain is the common task of all progressive human beings in the world!

Frankly speaking, the Spanish war could have been avoided from expanding and prolonging. Its expansion and prolongation are all the evil consequences of the "non-intervention" policy advocated by Britain and France. Under the pretext of preventing the expansion of the Spanish war, Britain and France advocated a "non-intervention" policy, depriving the Spanish government of the legal right to purchase arms from abroad, making it impossible for the Spanish people to arm themselves quickly, but the German-Italian fascists used the "non-intervention" policy as a talisman to continue to constantly interfere in the Spanish war.

Although the non-intervention policy is illegal, it can still help to end the Spanish war quickly if it can be genuinely implemented. But in fact, the British and French sides have implemented it too faithfully. For example, Britain restored the "Foreign Enlistment Act," prohibiting people from enlisting in Spain; France also sealed off the border with Spain. But Germany and Italy's interference in Spain has become even more intense and active. For two years, the German-Italian evil hands in Spain have never been loosened for a single day. Just looking at the calm accusations of Spanish Foreign Minister Valyte at the recent League of Nations Administrative Council meeting is enough to understand: "In November and December of last year, the number of arms shipped by Germany and Italy into Spain broke records. Since the Munich Agreement was concluded, enabling troops defending Central Europe to withdraw, the number of troops and armaments transported to the Nationalist army has greatly increased. Italian troops are now participating in the Catalonia offensive. The bombing of Barcelona on December 31st was actually assisted by the German and Italian air forces. In this way, it can be seen that the 'non-intervention' policy not only allowed the democratic countries to escape the obligation of aiding the Spanish people's anti-fascist resistance, but also protected the crimes of the German and Italian aggressors. The non-intervention farce directed by Britain and France has indeed not only betrayed the Spanish people, but also endangered world peace.

When Chamberlain visited Rome this time, Mussolini openly stated to him: "Italian troops will never withdraw until the Spanish Republican government is overthrown," and most of the troops currently attacking Barcelona are obviously Italian troops. At such a critical moment, if Britain and France do not promptly change their non-intervention policy and give the Spanish government legitimate aid, it would be tantamount to helping Germany and Italy harm the Spanish people.

Spain must be defended to the end. Spain, like China, is a bastion of world peace! Today, Spain has reached a critical juncture under the fierce attacks of Germany and Italy. All peace-loving and democracy-supporting people in the world must rise up to oppose the policy of appeasement of aggression, break free from the shackles of "non-intervention," and do their best to defend it!

### US Bans Arms Shipments to Japan; Public Opinion Increasingly Supports the Idea; Newspapers Praise Stimson's Proposal; Bitterman's Speech Criticizes Germany and Japan

(Washington) American newspapers unanimously praised the "Committee to Oppose Aiding Japanese Aggression" organized by Stimson. The Washington Star urged the government to ban the export of scrap iron as a way to curb wars of aggression in the Far East and Europe. The newspaper stated, "The strangest of our American actions is to continuously supply the basic raw materials for manufacturing military supplies to our supposed enemies. Today we supply these people, tomorrow they will become the tools they use to invade us. On the one hand, we talk a lot about peace, and on the other hand, we supply scrap iron to countries preparing for war. Can there be anything more contradictory than this?" At the same time, members of Congress have repeatedly received letters from citizens requesting the speedy enactment of legislation to ban the supply of American raw materials to Japan, Italy, and Germany. The State Department is paying close attention to this expression of public opinion, but it is not yet known whether it will follow the previous example of the public's automatic ban on the supply of aircraft to Japan, and the State Department will advise relevant commercial firms to ban the export of various raw materials to aggressor countries. (Associated Press telegram on the 23rd)

(Washington) A non-monetary radio station here recently launched a broadcast debate on the international situation today. Many celebrities from all walks of life participated in the event. Senator Bitterman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, delivered a speech on the American foreign crisis, stating that the threats posed to the United States by the omnipotent countries, namely Germany and Japan, are becoming increasingly large. "The United States government and all its citizens must adopt all legal means to resist the expansion movements of these countries, except for resorting to war. But if resistance is ineffective, then we must prepare to use force to repel these countries. In my opinion, the ambitions and policies of the heads of state of the Nationalists, Hitler and the Emperor, are almost impossible to satisfy. As for Japan, the country's ambitions and the policies promoted by the military department over the years are aimed at conquering Asia and the islands of the South Pacific, which is extremely clear." (Havas telegram on the 22nd)

(London) The Times newspaper here recently published an editorial commenting on the resolution on the Sino-Japanese dispute passed by the 104th session of the Council of the League of Nations, saying, "In addition to engaging in health and non-political work, the League of Nations has gradually become a center for member states to exchange views and seek redress for grievances. However, judging from the proceedings of this session of the Administrative Council, there has been more improvement and it has become a general collection of human political consciousness. The various suggestions made by Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, on the 17th of this month, have been difficult for the Administrative Council to fail to act upon. A certain country has in fact formally or informally adopted various measures that are the same as a certain suggestion made by Mr. Gu, which is a real situation and is of great significance and cannot be taken lightly," it said.

However, many subordinate departments will be dispersed to areas under the control of the government forces. The cabinet also decided to declare martial law throughout its jurisdiction, with all powers transferred to the Ministry of National Defense and the military authorities. Bars, cafes, and privately-run restaurants in Barcelona have all been closed. Hotels are currently only allowed to accommodate officials, soldiers, and refugees passing through the city. Nationalist aircraft have been bombing the city daily since Saturday. (Reuters telegram, 23rd) Barcelona The Republican government held a state council meeting last night and immediately decided to declare martial law throughout its jurisdiction. All government departments will remain in Barcelona and organize a committee to handle the evacuation of ordinary people in order to focus all efforts on defense work. In recent days, various archives have been transported to a certain location in the north, and all political prisoners and spies have also been moved elsewhere. (Havas telegram, 23rd) Barcelona All non-military factories and shops here will be closed this week to free up manpower to build the city's defensive fortifications. The Ministry of Economy has issued an order requiring all women under the age of 55 to immediately be available for deployment by the local military authorities, with violators to be prosecuted for treason. Those still allowed to open are armories, pharmacies, and food stores. (Reuters telegram, 23rd) Barcelona Nationalist aircraft have frequently attacked this week, with no fewer than ten air raids in the past 24 hours, resulting in 30 deaths and 66 injuries. German and Italian aircraft have participated in the air raids. Government fighter planes, previously used on the front lines, are now available to protect the city of Barcelona due to the shortening of the front lines. Recently, there have been frequent aerial battles between the two sides, with up to 50 fighters and bombers in the sky. One group of 40 Nationalist aircraft and 24 government aircraft engaged in a rare air battle. The Nationalists are clearly seeking to establish an aerial blockade line to prevent outside assistance, paying close attention to the coastal highway leading to France. (Reuters telegram, 23rd) Lerida Nationalist forces are now claiming that their front line is 15 miles from Barcelona, and that 150,000 troops are attacking the Robregat River line, which stretches from the coast to the northwest. The Nationalist forces are advancing an average of five miles per day in several positions, with the aim of cutting off Barcelona's lines of communication with France. (Reuters telegram, 23rd) Lerida The Nationalist General Headquarters recently issued a war report stating: "Our troops have occupied the city of Igualada and the port of Sitges on the Catalan front. The vanguard is now only fifteen kilometers from Barcelona, and the city has no defenses left." (Havas telegram, 22nd) Barcelona Nationalist forces on the Catalan front advanced on all lines today, concentrating their forces to launch a fierce attack on Martorell from Capellades and Piera in an attempt to break through the government forces' defenses. The mechanized units of the Nationalist forces in the Capellades area, under the cover of 100 tanks, advanced towards the government forces' positions. Although the government forces used anti-tank guns to stop their advance, they were ultimately forced to retreat due to the overwhelming firepower of the Nationalist forces. Nationalist forces in the Piera area also engaged in fierce fighting with government forces, lasting for six hours. The Nationalist forces launched six successive assaults, and the government forces were finally defeated and retreated towards Serramonton. In addition, a small detachment of Nationalist forces in front of Villanueva y Geltrú crossed the government forces' defense line and reached the vicinity of the port of Sitges (only 25 kilometers from the port of Barcelona). After being discovered by the government forces, they were immediately repelled. The fighting on all lines today was extremely fierce. The "Black Arrow" division of Italian volunteers belonging to the Nationalist forces participated in the battle on the Garraf heights. (Havas telegram, 22nd) U.S. Authorities Notify Citizens to Evacuate Barcelona The U.S. Consul General here has notified American citizens in Barcelona and Catalonia to prepare for evacuation. The U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Spain has used radio to notify the U.S. destroyer Omaha, currently in Villafranca, to immediately set sail for Carditaes, 20 miles north of Barcelona, to transport 30 American citizens out of the country. (Reuters telegram, 23rd) Saint Jean de Luz A report was received here yesterday stating that part of the diplomatic corps stationed in Barcelona has left the city, and another part is in the process of departing. The French embassy has been emptied, and the furniture has been shipped back to France. (Haitong, 23rd) Barcelona Severely Bombed German and Italian Planes Participating Barcelona Nationalist aircraft bombed the city a total of more than twelve times yesterday, killing 49 people and injuring over 100. There were two more air raids this morning, and the number of casualties is still unknown. (Havas telegram, 23rd) Barcelona Multiple Nationalist aircraft have been flying in shifts since 1:30 AM this morning until 6:15 PM, fiercely bombing the city no fewer than ten times. 30 residents were killed, and 75 were injured. The wharves and the central district of the old city were the hardest hit. Many houses were completely destroyed, and many homeless children were wandering the streets, in a truly tragic state. (Havas telegram, 20th) Valencia Multiple Nationalist aircraft fiercely bombed this port this morning, carrying out a total of three air raids. The British freighters Stanholm and Cardiff, as well as the French freighter Charles Mely, were anchored in the harbor and were affected. One sailor on board the Charles Mely was killed, and six were injured. (Havas, 22nd) Barcelona When Nationalist aircraft fiercely bombed this port today, the British ship African Voyager, which had recently arrived here from Oran in French North Africa loaded with grain, was also affected, taking several hits. Half of the ship has already sunk into the water. (Havas, 22nd) Valencia The British merchant ship African Seafarer was hit by a bomb during an air raid yesterday. It is reported that six crew members were killed, most of whom were Greek. Four other British ships were bombed later this week. A hole was blown in the side of the Deckle Brook, and seawater poured in. The deck of the Hunters Lee was badly damaged. The Dover Abbey, which was hit on Saturday, was hit again yesterday. (Reuters telegram, 22nd) The Spanish Question American Attitude Scrapping the Arms Embargo Widely Discussed (Washington) Regarding the issue of whether the U.S. arms embargo on Spain should be lifted, since former Secretary of State Stimson sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull advocating for it, members of the U.S. Congress have re-raised the issue and are actively discussing it. Most believe that the U.S. attitude should shift depending on how the French National Assembly and the British government decide on this issue. Florida Democratic Senator Pepper told reporters: "Since the European democracies are not prepared to help their sister country, it is not possible to hope that the United States will lift the arms embargo. The United States is closely watching the attitude of Britain and France towards the totalitarian countries. In short, if these countries cannot take a more resolute attitude, then how can we, 5,000 kilometers away, express sympathy to the Spanish Republican government?" North Dakota Republican Senator Nye, who introduced a bill to repeal the arms embargo in the previous Congress but failed to pass it, recently told reporters that he is prepared to re-introduce the bill in this Congress. "The American people, whether Republican or Democrat, largely believe that Spain has become a battlefield between democracy and autocracy." Although the environment in which the Spanish Republican government finds itself is very difficult, it is not hopeless and has the possibility of continuing to resist for several months. According to a certain newspaper, President Roosevelt and the State Department's sympathy for the Spanish Republican government has grown deeper. Former Secretary of State Stimson believes that the President has the power to repeal this arms embargo, and I personally share Stimson's sentiment. The President had the power to issue this embargo before, and now he has the power to repeal it." (Havas telegram, 22nd) The Spanish Situation Deteriorates France Pays Close Attention (Paris) Premier Daladier received Foreign Minister Bonnet this afternoon and immediately discussed the situation caused by the advance of the Spanish Nationalist forces towards Barcelona, lasting for three quarters of an hour. (Havas, 22nd) (Paris) After arriving here from Geneva yesterday, Spanish Republican Foreign Minister del Vayo met with French Foreign Minister Bonnet this morning, accompanied by the Spanish Ambassador Pascuia. It is reported that the discussion focused on the situation affected by the advance of the Spanish Nationalist forces towards Barcelona and the issue of refugees from the Republican government's territory seeking refuge in France. The French government has already drafted various special measures for the refugee problem to properly accommodate large numbers of refugees entering French territory. (Havas telegram, 23rd) (London) News from here last night stated that in recent days, Britain and France have been exchanging views on the political and diplomatic consequences of a Spanish Nationalist victory. It is understood that France is deeply worried because Franco's victory would completely destroy the balance of power for the French Republic. Therefore, in addition to strengthening the defense of its eastern border, France must concentrate a large number of troops on the Pyrenees border to prevent any eventuality. French officials are also quite concerned about the possibility that the financial and political influence of Germany and Italy may gain an advantage in Spain. Britain believes that Germany and Italy should not drag Spain into the European arms race. After the victory of the Spanish Nationalist forces, Mussolini may make concessions to France by withdrawing Italian troops from Spain. In addition to Tunisia, the Suez Canal, and Djibouti, the Italian Prime Minister will also ask France to clarify and guarantee its future policy towards Spain. London political figures acknowledge that these opinions exchanged between Britain and France are the necessary result of the Spanish Civil War. (Haitong telegram, 23rd) Burgos The Nationalist side claimed yesterday that 22 tanks were transported into Spain to assist the government forces through the French border towns of Jundras. Officials in these towns were ordered to allow the military supplies to pass through. (Reuters telegram, 13th) (Paris) The Communist Party recently held a national congress here, and Deputy Perri delivered a speech, stating that the country's foreign policy must be guided by the following: (1) Aid the Spanish Republican government, (2) Resist fascist countries, (3) The treaty signed by France with the republics of Syria and Lebanon in September 1936, which allows these republics to declare independence (this treaty has been approved by the French Senate and National Assembly), should be ratified, (4) Democratic countries must unite to deal with the current threats. The connection between France and the Soviet Union should be promoted. The large-scale anti-aggression movement launched in the United States should also be supported. It must be known that to this day, all totalitarian countries have encountered various difficulties. As for Italy, it has exhausted its resources due to the Italian-Ethiopian War and is now sending troops on a long expedition to interfere in the Spanish Civil War, and its economy is already exhausted. As for Japan, since using force against China, its financial burden has been increasing. As for the Soviet Union, its economic difficulties are also increasing. (Havas telegram, 23rd) Ciano Visits Southern Country and Returns Releases Statement on Trip Belgrade, Capital of Southern Country Italian Foreign Minister Ciano has been hunting in the Southern Country and holding talks with government officials for several days. Last night, Prime Minister Stoyadinovich hosted a banquet in his honor and awarded him the Grand Cordon of the White Eagle. Foreign Minister Ciano then departed for home at 12:00 noon. Prime Minister Stoyadinovich and other dignitaries went to the station to see him off, and crowds outside the station cheered to pay their respects. (Havas telegram, 23rd) Capital of Yugoslavia, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinovic have concluded their talks and are scheduled to return to Rome this evening. Regarding the talks, government officials released a statement stating that the implementation of the 1937 Italo-Yugoslav friendship treaty has been very satisfactory. The current diplomatic policies of both sides are based on this treaty as one of the basic elements. The economic institutions of the two countries are also complementary and should develop mutual trade relations. In addition, "various issues in the European situation that are related to both Italy and Yugoslavia have also been discussed by the two countries' cabinet members. They immediately reiterated that they are determined to step up cooperation in order to reach an agreement with the relevant countries and to enrich the peaceful order in this corner of Europe. Regarding this, the neighboring countries of the Southern Country have recently made efforts, and the Southern Country's government has responded to them. This is also based on the constructive spirit of the Rome-Berlin Axis in Italy and Germany, and they will work to participate in this cooperation." Informed sources here commented that the last paragraph of the statement refers to Hungary's desire to be closer to the Southern Country, and the Southern Country also has the same desire. However, it must first obtain the consent of Romania. (Havas telegram, 21st) Capital of Yugoslavia After the visit of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, political figures here declared that relations between the Southern Country and Hungary have improved. However, how close the two countries can actually be remains to be seen in a few weeks. At that time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky will visit Italy, and the Permanent Political Council of the Balkan Entente will meet in the capital of Romania. Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinovic will personally attend the meeting, and all issues related to Central Europe and the relations between Romania, the Southern Country, and Hungary can be discussed and decided with the Romanian government authorities. (Havas, 23rd) (Rome) Italian officials are very satisfied with the results of the talks between Ciano and Stojadinovic. It has been learned that several resolutions were reached during the talks: (1) Italy and Yugoslavia will establish close cooperation in the economic sphere. (2) An Italian Chamber of Commerce will be established in the capital of Yugoslavia, and a Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce will also be established in Rome. (3) A large-scale Italian automobile manufacturing plant will be established in Belgrade, with Yugoslav participation in the investment. In addition, a credit loan was also considered, with Italy providing Yugoslavia with a credit loan to purchase Italian military equipment worth 150 million lire. According to reliable sources, Italy may provide the Southern Country with other types of credit loans, not limited to military equipment. (Haitong News Agency telegram, 23rd) Austria A Disturbance Occurs Berlin Still Denies It The capital of Switzerland Suddenly it was reported that a disturbance occurred in the Austrian province of Germany. It is said that military movements within the province are frequent, which is very abnormal. Residents bordering Switzerland and the province are alarmed after hearing the news, and the authorities in the state of Sigal have strengthened security on the border. However, the actual situation is impossible to confirm, and the competent authorities have not obtained any credible information. (Havas telegram, 232nd) (Berlin) The rumor that a disturbance occurred in the Austrian province was denied by officials here. (Havas telegram, 23rd) Hungarian Catholics Oppose Pro-German Policies Capital of Hungary Since Prime Minister Imrédy has been pursuing a pro-German policy in foreign affairs and implementing anti-Semitic policies in domestic affairs, it has caused dissatisfaction among the Catholic Church in the country. In terms of foreign affairs, Catholics regret the government's abandonment of its moderate policy and its decision to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. In terms of domestic affairs, they are unhappy with the government's order to transfer 400 primary schools run by Hungarians to the control of Germans. 70% of these 400 schools are run by the Catholic Church, and parish priests have refused to comply with the order to transfer them, citing public opposition. In addition, Catholics have also contacted the Vatican, hoping that it will intervene and work with the government to reach a compromise solution and change the current anti-Semitic laws. In short, Catholics hope that Jews who convert to Catholicism or marry Catholics will not be subject to these laws. If this wish can be satisfied, then the anti-Semitic laws will fundamentally lose their racist nature. (Havas telegram, 22nd) Restrictions on Re-export of Export Goods (Hong Kong) In order to control the consumption of export goods, the government has newly formulated three articles on restrictions on the re-export of export goods, which have been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to be implemented by the customs. The main points are: For export goods, except for those exempt from foreign exchange settlement, they shall not be re-exported without a special domestic sales certificate issued by the Ministry of Finance.

Overview of the Singapore Military Base By John Gunther Translated by Wang Hongsheng The Singapore military base, known as the new Gibraltar, has recently been completed. It was prompted by Japan's "Twenty-One Demands." As early as 1915, Japan made it clear to China that Japan would be a formidable rival to Britain in the Far East. In 1919, Admiral Jellicoe suggested creating a British Pacific Fleet with Singapore as its base. He argued that in addition to cruisers, there should also be a battle fleet in the Far East, and that Britain should establish a "Western Hemisphere" naval policy. In 1922, the Imperial Conference met in London, considered Jellicoe's suggestion, and decided to build the Singapore military base. By 1922, the Washington Naval Limitation Treaty was signed, establishing naval ratios between the great powers, and the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was abolished. At this time, public opinion in Britain said that this new military base was superfluous and would only provoke Japan and cause him to be suspicious. Those who upheld justice believed that this new base was a moral violation of the Washington Naval Treaty, which prohibited the construction of fortresses or naval bases east of 110 degrees longitude, and Singapore was only six degrees away from this restricted area. Some even believed that Britain intended to cause trouble, but this was later officially denied. Construction of the base began in 1924 and was not fully completed until fifteen years later—February 14, 1938. Singapore is an island, 27 miles long and 14 miles wide, with a causeway across the Johor Strait connecting it to the mainland; it is located at the tip of Malaya, where ships to China and Japan must pass, perfectly controlling the artery of east-west traffic. During the construction, rumors spread that people were conducting espionage activities, so precautions were very strict, residents in the restricted area were ordered to relocate, and all construction workers had their fingerprints taken. The naval base is in Sembawang, on the north coast of the island, twelve miles from downtown Singapore. Not far east of the naval port is the air force base. Singapore has a total of three designs: one drafted by the British Army, one drafted by the Navy, and one drafted by the Air Force. The so-called Singapore base includes all three. In theory, this base is under the jurisdiction of the Army, with General Dobbie as commander-in-chief, whose authority is above all naval and air force officers stationed in Singapore. During construction, it was necessary to move mountains and fill rivers, spending a total of six million cubic feet of earthwork; as for filling in low-lying swamps, it cost eight million cubic feet of earthwork. To the right of the island are countless white-colored oil drums, containing one million tons of gasoline. Each drum is cast into a saucer shape, which is said to prevent the spread of flames in the event of an explosion. Underground are armories, so rich in storage that the entire base could be turned into powder with more than enough. The naval base covers an area of 21 square miles. Its main decorations are two huge and extraordinary docks, one floating dock and one repair dock. In the event of naval action, if ships are damaged, even the largest warships can enter the dock for repair. Without the Singapore base, damaged ships would have to go all the way to Malta for repairs, and by the time they returned, the war might already be over. This floating dock is 900 feet long and 200 feet wide, making it the third largest floating dock in the world. It can carry any huge battleship and still float; 60,000 people can stand on the bottom. This dock was built in England, disassembled into several parts and towed from Wallsend to Singapore, a distance of 10,000 miles. A total of eight Dutch tugs were used for towing, making it one of the great spectacles of the modern navy. The repair dock is slightly larger than the floating dock, 1,000 feet long, and took six years to complete at a cost of five million gold dollars, using 4.5 million cubic feet of concrete. Any ship in the world can be placed at will, and the most recent test proved that it can hold 68 million gallons of water. The floating dock can be moved elsewhere when necessary, such as Hong Kong; the repair dock cannot be moved. Near the two large docks are machine shops, power plants, storage warehouses, and one of the largest cranes east of the Suez Canal. Everything is doubled, except for the crane, so enemy planes must do two sets of work if they attack—assuming they break through the air defense line. Singapore's only drawback is that there are many reefs in the vicinity, making submarine activities inconvenient, but enemy submarines will certainly encounter the same difficulties near Singapore. Singapore's air force base is also very powerful, with three different military airfields and one civilian airfield. The civilian airfield was opened in June 1937 at a cost of US$5.25 million and was built on a newly reclaimed piece of land on the beach, so land and seaplanes can be used for both purposes. This airfield also has the advantage of being very close to Singapore's prosperous urban area, and it only takes seven minutes by car to reach it. One of the main military airfields also has facilities for both land and seaplanes, with over 20 miles of excellent water surface for seaplanes. No fewer than 40 air force squadrons are stationed at the base, and reinforcements can be flown in from India if necessary. Technically, Singapore is indeed a strong fortress, with 7,000 troops stationed there in peacetime, and more importantly, those mysterious forts and many gun emplacements, scattered on the easternmost tip of Singapore Island and on many small islands in the Strait. These small islands are home to many artillery teams and engineers. It is said that the defenses include not only 15-inch guns with a heavy range of 25 inches, but also the most powerful 18-inch guns in the world. The construction costs of the Singapore base are considerable, and strangely enough, this huge sum of money came from opium. According to official estimates, the total cost of the base is US$80.55 million, of which the naval base alone cost US$38.5 million to US$45 million. The floating dock is valued at US$4.85 million, and the towing fee from Wallsend to Singapore is US$1 million, including US$50,000 in Suez Canal tolls. The Sembawang air force base is valued at US$3.55 million, and the two military airfields are valued at US$1.75 million each. However, unofficial estimates are even higher. If the salaries of officers and soldiers and all indirect costs are included, the cost is no less than US$250 million. The sources of this sum of money are diverse; the Straits Settlements supplied the land for Sembawang, valued at US$750,000, New Zealand contributed US$5 million, and Hong Kong contributed US$1.25 million. Australia did not contribute money, but built a navy. The rich Malay Peninsula above Singapore is divided into directly and indirectly ruled parts. The directly ruled part—directly under the jurisdiction of the British headquarters—supplied US$1 million in cash and the No. 2 Royal Air Force Squadron, valued at US$1.5 million. The political independence of the indirectly ruled part is not superior to that of the directly ruled part. The Sultan of Johor supplied US$2.5 million. In total, the above-mentioned donations amount to US$21 million, slightly less than one-quarter of the total value of the base. Also, by 1933, the Straits Settlements had supplied another 60 million local currency (one local currency dollar is equal to US$0.58). After 1933, it provided a constant annual donation of 4 million local currency, plus a special fund of 1.5 million local currency in the last three years. Therefore, the total contribution of the Straits Settlements to the base is no less than 81.5 million local currency, equivalent to US$47.5 million. Adding the cash provided by the Straits Settlements to the above-mentioned donations, the total is US$68.5 million. Subtracting this number from the total value of US$80.55 million, the difference is US$12.05 million, which is what the British headquarters spent from its budget. It's really extremely cheap. Apart from the annual maintenance fee of US$2.5 million, the Singapore base has requested very little from the British headquarters. Twenty percent of the total revenue of the Straits Settlements comes from the sale of opium. This sale is a government monopoly, with the British buying raw opium from Iran or India and making it into a paste, packed in small metal tubes. One local currency dollar can buy one Singapore tael (equal to one and one-third ounces) of raw opium; while one tael of paste costs twelve local currency dollars. The profit is considerable, but it also has the meaning of prohibition in the tax, deliberately raising the price to reduce sales. The sale of the paste is strictly controlled; only registered addicts can buy it, and a doctor's certificate is required to join the ranks of addicts. A few years ago, the government, considering that opium transportation might be prohibited by international joint action, promulgated an opium substitute fund method, extracting 10% of the annual opium tax for separate safekeeping. This fund has now accumulated to 30 million local currency, and it is no longer necessary to increase it. Therefore, it is said that those 35,000 registered smokers simply bear one-fifth of the funds that the Straits Settlements has assisted in giving to the base. On the day the base was completed, the arrival of the US fleet caused panic among many people in the world. In this Sino-Japanese war, Japan's power is increasingly advancing southward. The completion of the Singapore base will certainly give Japan a considerable color. Soon, Britain declared, "If necessary, Britain is prepared to lease all the equipment of the new naval base to the United States for application." In other words, if a war breaks out, Britain will welcome the Americans to Singapore. On the one hand, the Americans are happy to do so, because west of Hawaii, she has no place to repair large ships. Once something happens in the Far East, Singapore's dock can meet her needs. According to the most reliable military observations, the base can only be attacked by the enemy on the northern mainland. A maritime attack is simply impossible, and an air raid can only damage the base but cannot occupy it. If the enemy attempts to occupy Singapore, they can only land infantry in Malaya or Vietnam, and then move south. This is the reason for increasing military airfields in these two places. Singapore's most valuable feature is its location, only 1,578 miles from Manila, 1,674 miles from Hong Kong, and 3,345 miles from Yokohama. Although Japan is building an important air force base in Taiwan, it must add at least 3,000 miles of firepower to launch a full-scale naval attack, and such a distance already exceeds the limits of modern expeditionary warships. In fact, the main target of naval warfare is commerce, not enemy ships. One of the important tasks of the Pacific War is to cut off the traffic of Japanese merchant ships, plus a blockade, which can lead to Japan's death. To achieve this goal, Singapore is the ideal place. Furthermore, Singapore's neighbor is an absolutely safe place. Vietnam can be said to have no political activities, such as national movements. Imagine putting Britain's military base in Egypt, Iraq, or India. The political situation there is a very serious problem. And Singapore has the most perfect air force facilities, which is much more convenient than Gibraltar, which has no good airfield. Therefore, concentrating military power in Singapore has several functions: giving the British Navy an oil depot and repair dock; giving Hong Kong a backing of military power; and protecting Australia, Colombo, and Calcutta; and establishing an armored defense stake in the center of

Central Police Department Chinese Deputy Inspector Huang Fusen Seriously Wounded in Sniper Attack
The assailant fired more than ten shots, hitting three.
Stray bullets wound apprentice. Police are secretly pursuing the murderer.
Yesterday morning around 11:30 AM, on the northern section of Yu Qiaqing Road in the Public Concession, a criminal sniper attack occurred targeting Huang Fusen, the Chinese Deputy Inspector of the Criminal Division of the Public Concession Medical Department. A young boy was also injured by a stray bullet. The details are as follows:

Brief Biography of the Victim
Huang Fusen was originally from Suzhou, 21 years old, and lived at No. 67 Anyi Village, North Xizang Road, Public Concession. He joined the工部局 (Gong Bu Ju, Public Works Department) Police Department in 1925 and has been employed there for 13 years. He is usually cautious and astute in his work, and therefore is highly valued by the police authorities. He has been a detective in the Huishan Police Department for many years. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, the Concession authorities, in view of the endless assassinations and terrorist cases within the Concession, decided to gather competent officers from various departments to form a Criminal Eighth Division specifically responsible for such cases. Huang was transferred to this division at that time to serve as the Chinese Deputy Inspector. However, recently, due to the gradual decrease in the workload of this division, the authorities abolished it in January of this year and merged it into the First Division. Huang was also transferred to the First Division and continued to serve as Deputy Inspector.

Hit by Three Bullets
Huang usually travels in his own rickshaw. Yesterday morning, around 11:30 AM, he was returning home from the office for lunch in his rickshaw when, near Guling Road on Yu Qiaqing Road, three strong men in short coats and long robes suddenly jumped out from the roadside. Each was holding a Mauser pistol and fired simultaneously at Huang Fusen. Hearing the gunshots, Huang knew something was wrong and immediately told the rickshaw puller to stop so he could find a place to hide. However, the assailants chased after him and continued firing, totaling more than ten shots. As Huang got out of the rickshaw, he was hit by three bullets and fell to the ground. Seeing their goal achieved, the assailants let out a shout and fled north towards Xiamen Road. By the time the nearby police officers arrived after hearing the gunshots, the perpetrators had long disappeared without a trace.

Westerner Offers Urgent Assistance
The rickshaw puller, witnessing his boss injured, cried out loudly and ran to No. 22 of the area, the police station, to report what had happened and provide details of his boss. The officer then realized what had happened. Upon inspection of the injured man, they found that he was bleeding profusely and unconscious, in critical condition. The officer, fearing that calling for an ambulance would delay treatment and endanger his life, negotiated with a Westerner driving his own car who was passing by the intersection, requesting urgent assistance. The Westerner readily agreed to the request and helped lift the injured man into the car and sped to宝隆(Bao Long) Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. At the same time, they telephoned the police station to report the incident. The Xinzha Police Department immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene to search for clues, but found nothing except a few empty bullet casings on the ground. These were taken back to the police station for examination as evidence for the investigation.

Serious Injuries
After being taken to Ward 306 of宝隆(Bao Long) Hospital by car, the hospital doctors washed the wounds. They found the following: one gunshot wound on the left shoulder, with the bullet passing through the flesh from the neck to the shoulder; one gunshot wound in the back, with the bullet exiting from the front chest; and one gunshot wound in the left lower back, with the bullet remaining lodged in the abdomen, which was the most serious wound. There was no certainty that the bullet could be removed, and this depended on his physical condition and recovery. Based on the current situation, the injuries were extremely dangerous. Huang's younger brother, Fugen, a detective at the Huishan Police Department, rushed to the hospital with his family after receiving the report. The police department, for security reasons, also dispatched detectives to the hospital for protection and to offer condolences.

Intensive Manhunt
As for the motive behind the assassination, there are conflicting rumors. Some say it was due to his diligence in his duties, which caused resentment from criminals. However, the credibility of this remains to be investigated and will be revealed in due course. Currently, the police department is taking this case very seriously, with all officers mobilized to hunt down the perpetrators. In addition, a young boy from Jiangbei, named Xue Xiaosizi, 14 years old, an apprentice at the久丰(Jiu Feng) Shoe Store at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Wenzhou Road, was injured by a stray bullet that hit the bone of his left foot but did not pass through. He was taken to宝隆(Bao Long) Hospital for treatment by his colleagues. Fortunately, the injury was not critical, and he is expected to recover.

Right Kidney Removed
(Further Report) Huang Fusen's condition remained unchanged until midnight yesterday. He was recovering well.

Because of his strong physique, they performed surgery at 3 PM that afternoon and discovered that his right kidney had been shattered by the bullet. They removed the right kidney and resealed the wound. Afterwards, he fell asleep, and his body temperature was normal.

Impersonating Hospital Nurse
Prison Guard Commits Fraud for Money
Extorting Money from Inmates' Families
His greed led to arrest and prosecution
Xiao Jin, a Guangdong native, was arrested on December 16th of last year for private trafficking in opium. The First Special District Court sentenced him to three years and six months in prison. Unexpectedly, on January 19th of this year at 8:30 AM, Huang Zhangquan, 23 years old, a native of Pudong residing at No. 328 Baoding Road, and a guard No. 159 at the华德路 (Hua De Lu) Prison of the Public Works Department, went to Xiao Jin's home at No. 20 Xinping Lane, Longmen Road, impersonating a nurse from the工部局 (Gong Bu Ju, Public Works Department) Hospital. He told Xiao Jin's son, Genmin, that his father was ill in prison and had asked him to bring a message requesting two tins of British brand cigarettes, four packets of 八卦丹(Ba Gua Dan, a type of herbal medicine), and a reward of 20 yuan. After speaking, he produced a note to prove that it was written by Xiao Jin in prison. Xiao Genmin, without suspicion, gave him everything he asked for. However, after secretly inquiring, Xiao Genmin found out that his father was not sick in prison and became suspicious, realizing that Huang Zhangquan had committed fraud. Just as he was about to investigate, Huang, driven by greed, believing he could take advantage of the situation, went to Xiao Genmin's residence again at around 8 AM the other morning, showing another note and attempting to extort 50 yuan. He was reported to the Chengdu Road Police Department, who dispatched detectives Zhang Kuidong and 西探(Xi Tan) Tuile to arrest Huang Zhangquan and take him into custody. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case, stating that the prisoner had not been transferred, and fearing that the defendant might have committed other crimes, requested a postponement. Judge Xiao questioned the defendant, Huang Zhangquan, who confessed that he had been a prison guard at the华德路 (Hua De Lu) Prison for five months, earning a monthly salary of 24 yuan. He claimed that a prisoner had instructed him to do this. Judge Xiao reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained for seven days for further investigation and questioning.

Former Huizhong Hotel Director Sun Zhiqi Sued by Divorced Concubine
Represents Daughter in Claim for Educational Support
Denies Huizhong Hotel Sales Contract
Court Orders Both Parties to Present Evidence for Further Hearing
Sun Zhiqi, the former owner of the Huizhong Hotel, was involved in a lawsuit with his concubine, Wang Wenyun, last year, resulting in a payment of 50,000 yuan and a formal separation. Their daughter, Fengyin, was placed in Wang's custody. Later, Sun published a statement declaring that he would not be responsible for any of Fengyin's actions outside the home. Wang, however, claimed that the 50,000 yuan Sun had paid did not include educational support for their daughter. Furthermore, Sun had sold the Huizhong Hotel to his adopted son, Sun Bosheng, last autumn without Fengyin's consent. This sale, she alleged, was orchestrated by Sun and his son Bosheng, along with his nephew Sun Guangyuan and his in-law Jin Yigeng. Therefore, she, as Fengyin's legal guardian, filed a lawsuit against Sun Zhiqi, Sun Bosheng, Sun Guangyuan, and Jin Yigeng.

Filing a Lawsuit
Yesterday afternoon, Judge Peng Shi of the First Special District Court convened a hearing. The plaintiff, Wang Wenyun, was absent due to illness, and only the defendant Sun Bosheng appeared. Lawyers for both sides presented the names, ages, and addresses of their respective clients. Sun Zhiqi's lawyer stated that he was from Changshu. Sun Bosheng claimed that he was from Shaoxing. The court pointed out that even though Bosheng was adopted, as Zhiqi's biological son, father and son should share the same place of origin. Bosheng claimed that they made a mistake. The plaintiff's lawyer, Li Mian, then began to state the

Purpose of the Lawsuit
The lawsuit had five points, summarized in two parts. (A) Request to order Sun Zhiqi to pay 35,000 yuan for Fengyin's educational support, stating that Fengyin, currently 13 years old, requires 5,000 yuan per year in educational expenses. Until she reaches 20 years old, there are seven years remaining, so her father should pay 35,000 yuan. The 50,000 yuan her mother received did not include educational support for their daughter, and her mother's debts amounted to 50,000 yuan. Therefore, she has no remaining funds. As for Sun Zhiqi's notice stating that he would

Not Be Responsible
for Fengyin's actions, it had a different meaning. (B) Request to declare the sale of the Huizhong Hotel invalid and confirm Fengyin's 40,000 yuan stake in the hotel. It was claimed that Sun Zhiqi's son, Bosheng, was adopted and that Fengyin was his only daughter. Zhiqi had millions in assets and had gifted them to his daughter in a written agreement. After the separation of Fengyin's biological mother, Wang Wenyun, Bosheng and Guangyuan, coveting the wealth, flattered him. Zhiqi, misled by slanderous words, published a notice canceling the gift. However, the gifts given by relatives and friends when Fengyin was born, totaling 40,000 yuan, were later invested by her father in the Huizhong Hotel as capital.

Engaging Daughter
to Jin Yigeng's son, this 40,000 yuan stake was transferred to Jin's name, allowing Jin to serve as chairman after the Huizhong was reorganized into a limited company. Sun Guangyuan was only a manager at the Huizhong. Bosheng's purchase of the Huizhong last autumn was illegal, both because Bosheng lacked the financial resources and because Guangyuan was not authorized to sell it. Therefore, this sale was illegal and should be declared invalid, and Fengyin's 40,000 yuan stake should be confirmed. Sun Bosheng stated that his purchase of the Huizhong's brand and assets was valued at

100,000 Yuan
and did not include the land. Sun Zhiqi's lawyer, Wang Shang, then argued against the five points of the lawsuit, stating that the 50,000 yuan previously given to Wang included the daughter's educational support. Huizhong was originally founded by the defendant alone. Later, because Sun Guangyuan provided years of assistance,

he gifted the hotel to him, and Guangyuan reorganized it into a limited company. The plaintiff had misunderstood. The four-wan stake he claims

cannot be questioned
Lastly, Jin Yigeng's representative lawyer, E Sen, stated that Jin Yigeng had never served as chairman of the Huizhong. Although Sun Zhiqi, because his Qian Zhuang (money exchange shop) had collapsed and he feared it would affect other assets, decided to change the Huizhong into a company and transfer a 40,000 yuan stake to Jin's name, with Jin acting as chairman, Jin did not accept the position. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that they had documents to prove this point and could not agree. The court, finding the case complex, ordered both parties to present evidence for a hearing at a later date.

Stealing Bicycles
Nine Accomplices Arrested
Over Thirty Bicycles Recovered
Victims Can Identify Their Bikes at the Chengdu Police Station
Wang Asan from Wuxi stole a bicycle belonging to Gao Shengguan at the intersection of Tongfu Road and Jing'an Temple Road at 9:20 AM on the 19th of this month and tried to escape. Gao saw him and reported to the police. Wang and the bicycle were taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Detectives Wu Junqing, Chen Yaoting, and Zhou Yushan investigated and learned that Wang specialized in stealing bicycles in the Public Concession and that he had many accomplices, committing dozens of crimes. Based on his confession, they arrested seven accomplices: Dai Agen, Zhang Debiao, Wang Agen, Wang Daerzi, Wang Shihhuai, Dong Rushi, and Li Yu. They also arrested Fang Licheng and Huang Maochang, who received the stolen goods, at the Hongfei Bicycle Shop at No. 184 Shanhai Pass Road. They recovered over thirty bicycles, which were taken to the police station. This morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. After questioning, Judge Xiao ordered them to be detained until the 30th for further investigation. Since the owners of the recovered bicycles have not been identified, anyone who has had a bicycle stolen can go to the Chengdu Road Police Station to identify it.

Drug Offenders Executed in Guerrilla Areas

The Hua Fang Guerrilla Team and the New Fourth Army's Mass Self-Defense Corps in Pudong have received orders from their superiors to implement drug prohibition in their areas. Notices have been posted everywhere, stating that any drug offenders caught with three convictions will be executed by firing squad; two convictions will result in a term of imprisonment; and one conviction will result in two months of imprisonment and mandatory rehabilitation to prevent the enemy from poisoning the guerrilla areas and harming the healthy population.

Guerrillas Seize Japanese Soldiers
Four Japanese Soldiers Missing
Abandoned Truck Left Behind
According to reliable sources, around 9 AM on Sunday morning, four Japanese soldiers were seized from a military truck by Chinese guerrillas at the corner of Hongqiao Road and Robber General Road. The details are unknown, but the truck was abandoned by the roadside all day. On Sunday night at 10 PM, a group of armed bandits robbed several households in a village on Robber General Road, but the loot was minimal. They then kidnapped a seven-year-old child, but abandoned him on the roadside for fear of attracting attention due to his loud crying. The child was sent home by the doorman of a foreign residence. Due to the frequent robberies in the Hongqiao Road area in recent days, Japanese soldiers extensively searched the villages in the area yesterday.

Three Years Without Conjugal Bliss: Underlying Secrets
Wasted Youth, Mental Anguish
Mediation Fails, Separate Lawsuit Filed
Zhang Junying, a lawyer and local resident of No. 202, Masnan Road, French Concession, has been sued by his wife, Zhang Yuying (25 years old, from Taicang), through her lawyer, Tao Muxia, in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court. She is seeking mediation to dissolve the marriage, return her dowry, and compensate for damages. The petition states that since their marriage in October 1935, they have had no conjugal relations. After repeated questioning, the husband has remained secretive and unforthcoming. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that the husband has a hidden illness that prevents him from consummating the marriage, leading to a serious mistake that has wasted the wife's youth and caused her mental anguish. As the days go by, the plaintiff cannot continue to sacrifice herself. Therefore, she is seeking mediation to dissolve the marriage, return her dowry, and compensate for damages. Based on the petition, the court, presided over by Judge Sun Pengxian, convened a mediation hearing yesterday. The husband, Zhang Junying, was absent, and only the plaintiff, accompanied by her lawyer, appeared to present the facts. The court declared the mediation unsuccessful and instructed the plaintiff to file a formal lawsuit.

Apprentice Is Naughty and Vicious
Attempts Arson
Fortunately, a Tenant Discovers and Extinguishes the Flames
Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months by the Court
Li Defu, 20 years old, from Nanjing, was an apprentice at the Mahjong parlor run by Song Fusheng at No. 162 North Jiangxi Road. He was known for being naughty and vicious. On the upper floor of the building, Li Cuiqin, a 21-year-old woman from 廣實(Guang Shi), lived in a separate room. Her fiancé, Liang Yinglin, often visited her. Li Defu suspected that they were

Whispering Sweet Nothings
or engaging in improper behavior in the pavilion. He often went upstairs to peek and observe their movements. Two weeks ago, Liang discovered this and beat him before leaving. Li Defu harbored resentment towards Li Cuiqin and plotted revenge. Recently, Liang Yinglin had not been visiting, so he had no opportunity to act. In a fit of anger, he devised a malicious plan. Yesterday morning at 3:50 AM, he secretly took a bottle of kerosene (costing ten copper coins) and some wood shavings and rosin that he had bought during the day to the staircase landing on the upper floor. He poured the kerosene on the steps and

Lit the Rosin
The flames quickly spread, intending to murder Li Cuiqin by burning her to death. He then went downstairs and tried to flee. The fire was discovered by Wang Xiaoniu, a tenant who lived in the same building and was a

Seller of Opium
Seeing the flames, he rushed upstairs and extinguished the fire, preventing a disaster. After a while, Li Defu returned to the building and was questioned by the two landlords, Luo Zhushi and Li Cuiqin, as well as several other tenants. Frightened, Li

Jumped Out the Window to Escape
Injuring his head and feet, he was unable to stand. The landlord, Luo Zhushi, reported the incident to the汇司 (Hui Si, foreign) Police Department, who sent detective Shen Dehui to the scene. He took the apprentice to Renji Hospital for treatment before sending him to the First Special District Court at 9 AM. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin prosecuted him for endangering public safety under Article 173, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code, requesting a severe punishment. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned him thoroughly and sentenced Li Defu to three years and six months of imprisonment as a warning.

Earthwork Contractor Accused of Abandonment
Liu Zichuan, a Guangdong native who previously ran the聚丰 (Ju Feng) Earthwork Company in the Nine Acres area (36 years old, residing at No. 85 Baoyu Lane, French Concession), is now being sued for abandonment by his concubine, Zhou Suzhen (25 years old, from Luodian), through her lawyer in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. According to the plaintiff, the defendant seduced her into an affair in August 1932, when she was 19 years old, while her parents were away in their hometown to find a wife for her brother. They have been living together since then. At first, they were on good terms, but recently, he has become indifferent and neglectful, and she has suffered in many unspeakable ways. She requests an investigation. The defendant, accompanied by his defense lawyer, appeared in court and admitted that he had taken the plaintiff as a concubine in August 1934, and they have been living together ever since. She smokes opium and white powder, and he gives her 50 cents a day for expenses, which increased to one yuan after the war. She spends it all and goes out without returning, staying in Yanziwo. He has not abandoned her and still wants her to come home. The court reviewed the statements and ordered the defendant to post a 500 yuan bond and adjourned the hearing to February 1st. If he cannot provide the bond, he will be detained.

Gas Explosion on South Side of 盆汤弄 Bridge
Bridge Catches Fire, Quickly Extinguished
Yesterday at noon, an underground gas pipeline broke at the corner of North Suzhou Road and North Shanxi Road in the Public Concession, causing a gas leak. The自来火 (Zi Lai Huo) Company immediately sent workers to repair it.

They opened the iron plate on the ground and suddenly heard a rumbling sound below. Then, there was a loud explosion, with flames shooting out of the hole. The盆汤弄 (Pen Tang Nong) bridge on North Shanxi Road was also set on fire. A fire brigade was immediately called, and they arrived and extinguished the fire, and turned off the gas. The fire on the bridge and in the hole was soon extinguished. During the fire, the bridge was closed to traffic for about two hours. Two workers were burned on their faces and chests, but the injuries were not serious enough to require hospitalization.

Robbery at White Russian Gambling Den in Western Shanghai
The大陸报 (Da Lu Bao) reports that a robbery occurred at a gambling den run by White Russians on亿定盘 (Yi Ding Pan) Road early this morning (23rd), injuring a White Russian named An Keman. The details are as follows: Shortly after midnight, five bandits, each armed with a Mauser pistol, broke into the gambling den with the intention of robbing the large number of foreign gamblers at the roulette table, including several women. Seeing the robbers with guns, they all fearfully raised their hands. One or two people tried to resist, and the robbers fired a shot, injuring a White Russian employee named An Keman. At the same time, a White Russian tavern owner, who had his own Mauser pistol, took it out and fired a shot into the air. The robbers, apparently thinking that the gambling den was guarded and that they were outmatched, fled. A few minutes later, police officers from the Public Concession Police Department and puppet police arrived at the scene and took the injured man to the hospital. Although he was shot in the back, his injuries are not serious, and he is expected to recover.

Court Orders Investigation, Defendant Released on Bail

However, the defendant regretted his decision and married another woman on December 4th,

Abandoning Lingmei.
She is requesting a trial under Articles 240 and 239 of the Criminal Code. Based on the lawsuit, Judge Liao Yuan of the court convened a hearing yesterday. The plaintiff, mother and daughter, and their lawyer testified to the previous events. The defendant, accompanied by his defense lawyer, also appeared in court and admitted to having a relationship with Lingmei, but claimed that Lingmei was a dancer and denied the charge of seduction.

He Claimed to have Stayed at a Hotel
The note was coerced and written by her sister along with hooligans, who dragged the defendant to the春江 (Chun Jiang) Third Inn. The court reviewed the statements and ordered a postponement to February 1st for further investigation and testimony. The defendant was released on bail of 1,000 yuan; if he is unable to provide the bail, he will be detained.

Modern Life	Whooping Cough: The Great Calamity of Winter for Children's Lives (Shen Zhongjun) Whooping cough, also known as "startling cough," mostly affects children around the age of seven. The symptom of this disease is that when it doesn't cough, it's fine, but once it starts coughing, it's a series of violent coughs, causing the child's face to turn red, ears to redden, sweat to pour from their forehead, and even vomiting of food. The veins on the head bulge, and the eyeballs protrude, causing extreme suffering. The most terrifying thing about children suffering from this disease is the complication of pneumonia. Generally, pneumonia accounts for the majority of deaths among children suffering from whooping cough. Moreover, the course of whooping cough is very long. The child's lungs are not only damaged, but their overall health is also severely affected, leading to gradual weakening. Even if pneumonia does not occur, there is still a risk of developing pulmonary tuberculosis (consumption) later in life. Parents must pay careful attention to nursing their children. Medical knowledge in our country is not yet widespread. Whooping cough is often seen as a symptom of a cold, or people mistakenly administer miscellaneous drugs from the market, or neglect treatment altogether, resulting in a shockingly high number of young lives lost each year. Those who are cultivating national strength should pay attention to this. Editor's Note: When treating whooping cough in children, never administer miscellaneous drugs haphazardly, as the harm can be unimaginable. According to the experience of various physicians, administering 'Lung Vitality' PhlthWeal internally to children suffering from whooping cough is the safest and most appropriate treatment. This is because 'Lung Vitality' effectively clears the lungs, resolves phlegm, and stops coughing, and its lung-strengthening effect is well-documented. Therefore, it can prevent dangerous symptoms such as pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis. In addition, 'Lung Vitality' contains no anesthetic agents, making it safe and worry-free even for infants. Modern Middle School Students A Tragic and Serious Problem (Lu Zhicheng) Currently, there are two kinds of Chinese people in dire straits. One is the refugees who are suffering from the iron hooves of the Japanese and the scourge of bandits. The other is the middle school students who are burdened with the responsibility of studying. The threat faced by refugees is immediate hunger, cold, and death. The threat faced by middle school students is the destruction of their health and the resulting decline of the nation. If readers think this comparison is excessive, then please take a look at the following representative facts. (1) A parent once told me about his experience studying in middle school. He said: 'The suffering we endured in middle school was even worse than in elementary school... Usually, classes were held from 8 AM to 4 or 5 PM every day. The homework assigned by teachers each day took another four or five hours... When I was in middle school, I was confident that I could work hard, but because of rushing homework, I went to bed late and got up early every day. Even weekends were extremely busy. Even bathing and haircuts were done in a great hurry... Studying like this, by the time I was in my second year of high school, I suffered from severe neurasthenia... By the time I graduated from high school, my strong physique and lively spirit had both turned into weakness and dullness.' (2) A high school girl told me: 'I can't finish my homework until 1 AM every day. But if I go to bed too late, I can't fall asleep. I often can't close my eyes until 3 AM. Imagine, only sleeping three hours a night, how can I not have headaches and fevers and get sick? Don't think I'm an exception. In fact, there are many, many classmates living the same life as me!' (3) A middle school student wrote to me saying: 'The most difficult thing about the current middle school curriculum is mathematics. On average, there are six to eight hours of math class per week. The problems left after one hour of class, if a student is a bit slow, will take five hours to complete. Almost every week, I have to spend seventeen or eighteen hours on math... Someone who doesn't like math has to work hard to graduate and pass the entrance exam. Most of the time is spent on this one subject, and the result is not good. On the contrary, I have neglected the subjects I like and don't have time to look at them... There is so much schoolwork that graduating from this school is worrisome enough. Adding an entrance exam makes some students rush desperately. I know a student who, the year before last, was so afraid of failing the entrance exam that he didn't sleep for ten nights. Later, feeling that his spirit could not hold up, he took morphine injections. In the end, he still failed two subjects. How cruel! If you don't work hard, you can't graduate with so much homework. If you work hard, your spirit is limited, so you have to take morphine injections.' This time, I didn't do any public investigation. I just took the crisis of middle school students as material and discussed it with friends. What I found was that neurasthenia has become a serious problem for middle school students. That's why I say: The suffering of middle school students now is even more profound than that of the refugees in front of us. Young students are the vitality of the nation and the backbone of the country and society. The mission and tasks they bear are undoubtedly very important. If they are bound by neurasthenia, their spirit will be depressed, their consciousness will be uncertain, their physiology will be abnormal, and their ideals will be inconsistent with their lives. As a result, their courage is frustrated, their vitality is reduced, and they are dazed all day long. Sometimes they have headaches and insomnia, and sometimes they have palpitations and dizziness. Almost their whole body is sick, causing Promising young people - turn into useless cripples. In this extraordinary period when the life of the nation is about to be destroyed, in this emergency juncture when the history of the nation is about to be cut off, how to help this large group of middle school students who have been ravaged by neurasthenia is indeed an urgent problem! Although the threats faced by middle school students are more serious than those faced by refugees, the methods of helping them are simpler and easier than helping refugees. According to the instructions of most health experts, young students should often take a kind of 'MemoryNeurotic' brain tonic to enhance their brain power and replenish new energy. In this way, they can always keep their minds clear and their spirits strong, and they can cope with difficult and heavy courses without fatigue. Because 'MemoryNeurotic' brain tonic is the great nerve tonic of the times. In addition to being rich in various vitamins, proteins, and lecithin, it also contains hormones extracted from the healthy animal brain marrow and spermatic gland hormones extracted from the spermatic glands. These precious ingredients are not found in any other similar tonics. Therefore, 'MemoryNeurotic' has excellent effects and is indeed a powerful tool for overcoming neurasthenia. Young students should prepare it for their future good fortune! But there are many inferior medicines on the market. Be sure to specify 'MemoryNeurotic'. Humankind's Desire: The Problem of Reversing Aging How to Prevent Early Aging for Those in Their Forties and Fifties How Can Elderly Men Stay Vigorous Despite Aging? Translated by Shen Zhaoquan From the American Fitness Newspaper, Volume 12, Number 10 A person needs at least twenty years of education after birth before they can serve society. Therefore, people in their forties and fifties, precisely because they have spent much effort and received many lessons, are able to acquire some knowledge, experience, and life skills. Just when they are most happy in life and their careers are of the greatest value to society, old age, unknowingly and naturally, gradually arrives. The dreadfulness of old age is that as soon as it arrives, no matter who it is, they will lose their ambition and become pessimistic about everything. It can be seen how terrible old age is. There is nothing more tragic in the world than this. The changes of aging, reaching old age, are an inevitable tragedy for everyone. However, the age of aging varies. Some people do not notice it until they are ninety or a hundred years old, while others show signs of premature aging in their forties and fifties. Biologists tell us that people who are chronically overworked, such as literary figures, politicians, scientists, and large entrepreneurs, are prone to aging. In addition, people who lead a generally romantic life, such as those who indulge in sexual desire and abuse alcohol and tobacco, can accelerate aging and shorten their lives. French professor Voronoff of the Paris University Medical School said: Although people cannot avoid death, they can live longer. According to the common rule for animals, human life should reach seven times the age of their physiological development period—if we assume twenty years as the age of completion of development, then the ideal age for human lifespan is actually one hundred and forty years. Anyone who dies before reaching this natural lifespan is called a premature death. And in fact, there are frequent records of people living to be one or two hundred years old in newspapers. (Translator's note: The congratulatory message for Mr. Ma Xiangbo's 100th birthday published in this newspaper recently can also fully prove that longevity is indeed possible). However, they are relatively rare. And the reason why they are rare is mostly because the elderly lose their resistance to diseases in their youth. For example, the same case of pneumonia, young people often recover from it, while old people are prone to heart failure and death. If the elderly can maintain the vigor of their youth, then they will not fear diseases and can expect to live a long life. So how can we reverse aging and regain youth? This can be remedied by science in modern times. Qin Shi Huang sent strongmen to the east to Fusang to seek the elixir of immortality, which is a famous story in history. There are also people who believe in Buddhism and Taoism, swallowing cinnabar and refining elixirs, hoping to live as long as turtles and cranes. It can be seen that the desire for "longevity" is something that everyone desires, both ancient and modern. However, these ideals are mostly superstitious and ignorant. Now there are many people who, by middle age—that is, in their forties and fifties—show signs of premature loss of vitality, decline in energy, and soreness in the lower back, making them unable to work. These people are called premature aging—progeria—although they take all kinds of tonics on the market, the results are invariably disappointing. Most of them are strenuous and fruitless. They no longer know that the life functions of the human body are very ingenious. The causes of aging are very complicated and cannot be remedied by simply taking tonics or getting tonic injections. It is necessary to have a basis in advanced academic theory, and a meticulous and complex preparation is required to transform life—to achieve the ideal wish of not aging. Since the French biologist Brown-Sequard and the German professor Berthald of Kaidingyuan University advocated the theory of reversing aging, scholars around the world have successively risen up to study it. Recently, the anti-aging agent "Apopleyxin" created by Dr. Hentze, a German expert in anti-aging techniques, has caused a global sensation. After extensive and widespread trials, it is generally recognized that the drug does have the effect of reversing aging and regaining youth. From now on, premature elderly people around the world can have a technique for longevity. This anti-aging agent "Apopleyxin" is the culmination of Mr. Hentze's thirty years of painstaking research. Its ingredients include various hormones from the heart, brain, kidneys, and puberty glands of animals, various vitamins, and ingredients including deer velvet. It concentrates the essence of Western, animal, plant, and mineral medicines in one furnace and is formulated using the most complex scientific methods. It can be said that everything related to human life is included. When we take it, it can make the overall life functions lively and vigorous, and the vitality does not decline. According to the reports of biologists from various countries, modern humans are at their peak of energy in their thirties and forties, and enter old age and decline in energy in their fifties and sixties. Now, try using this anti-aging agent "Apopleyxin" on general premature elderly people. After taking it for ten weeks, the only phenomenon is that it can restore the vigor and interest of their youth to seventy-year-old men. It can give generally premature aging adults a strong physique again. The most amazing thing is that elderly women can also have a rosy complexion and wrinkles disappear after taking it, restoring their youth and vitality. Old men with premature sexual desire can have ancient wells with heavy waves. Now let's summarize the effects verified from various aspects and give a brief description below: (1) When used by elderly men and women, it can make vitality strong, energy undiminished, the body warm, not afraid of the cold, the ears and eyes clear, and the steps light and agile, without the suffering of dizziness and blurred vision. (2) When used by adults in their forties and fifties, it can prevent neurasthenia, make the mind clear, improve memory, and provide sufficient energy, so they are not tired of work, and can extend the age of activity in society to seventy or eighty years old or more. (3) This agent has the effect of activating blood and removing wind. It can treat all kinds of muscle and bone soreness, numbness, hemiplegia, waist pain, etc. The effect is better than other common medicines. Elderly people often take it, and these pains will never occur. (4) This agent has an extremely perfect heart-strengthening effect. For all elderly people with heart failure, palpitations, uneasiness, heart deficiency, easy fright, heartbeats, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath, various heart diseases, and difficulty breathing, it is effective immediately after taking it, and it can nourish the heart meridian when used for premature aging, and always keep the heart comfortable and sleep safe. (5) This agent contains lactic acid bacteria preparations, which are effective in eliminating various harmful pathogenic bacteria in the intestine, preventing blood poisoning, and preventing arteriosclerosis. It can also relieve constipation and clear the intestines, aid digestion, and treat various gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, this lactic acid bacteria agent is especially popular in recent theories for preventing aging and prolonging life. (6) This agent can regulate the circulatory force of the blood and can reduce excessively high blood pressure, so it can prevent heart rupture and stroke (cerebral hemorrhage) with special effects. (7) The Good.CaloiDiuretine in this agent is the latest discovery of special effects for the treatment of arteriosclerosis and obesity. It is effective and reliable for preventing stroke (that is, cerebral hemorrhage), and cannot be compared with ordinary seaweed preparations on the market. After writing about all the effects of the anti-aging agent "Apopleyxin" here, I have to tell readers: Humans are born to die. This is something that everyone cannot deny. What is said here about "Apopleyxin" is by no means to achieve the art of immortality. However, its effect can indeed promote the vigorous vitality of all parts of the human body, strengthen the power to resist diseases, and prevent and eliminate all the inducements that destroy life. Therefore, it can prevent the rapid progress of aging, so that people who should not age do not age prematurely, and extend their age of activity. They can serve society for a few more years. Even people who have reached old age are also old and strong, and can continue to live a thriving life to the ideal age. Therefore, many scientists, writers, and large entrepreneurs can extend their activity—spiritual and mental—by taking this kind of "Apopleyxin", although they are seventy or eighty years old, they still look as strong as they were in their thirties and forties, and are therefore able to complete their work and hopes. This is what anti-aging agents contribute to mankind, only pay attention to one of the above. If you don't take daily hygiene to heart, that won't work either. Wise readers should make their lives conform to the laws of nature. At a minimum—always within the realm of possibility—strive to eliminate bad habits such as overeating, excessive sexual desire, and excessive smoking and drinking. At the same time, use anti-aging agents to make up for vitality. This is the best way to prevent premature aging—which is also the most scientific way to prolong life. (Note) "Apopleyxin" is a kind of silver oral tablet. Men and women can take it after the age of forty. No matter whether they are sick or not, or whether their constitution is strong or weak, it is beneficial and harmless to any aspect of the body. This product has just arrived in Shanghai from Germany. Wing On, Sincere, and Sun Sun Department Stores' Western medicine departments and all high-end pharmacies are selling it. There is a very detailed Chinese and English instruction manual attached to the bottle, which can be read. Translator's Notes Lung Disease Where Are the Special Medicines? (Physician Gu Hongda) Regarding the treatment of lung diseases, there are still no special medicines that can directly enter the lungs to kill bacteria today. This is generally recognized by scholars around the world. After chemical analysis, the medicines advertised in the market as having special effects often contain no special drugs, and even contain morphine and other anesthetics. If patients mistakenly use these miscellaneous drugs, they may feel that the pain is reduced at the time, but they do not know that the root of the disease has not been removed, and the symptoms are still secretly progressing and spreading. If it breaks out suddenly, the condition will become more serious, and it will be too late to regret it. Therefore, administering miscellaneous drugs haphazardly is the most risky action. From the standpoint of modern medicine, the internal medicine that is suitable for the principle of treatment and suitable for patients to recuperate at home is 'Lung Vitality' Phith Weal. This product is a modern organ preparation recognized by medical science. Its efficacy revives the lung's vitality and produces a natural defense function and anti-tuberculosis element, exerting the effect of natural healing. Therefore, after the patient takes it, he feels the lungs are clear and refreshing, the phlegm is thin and loose, the cough and asthma are reduced, the appetite is increased, and the body becomes stronger day by day. The condition shows extremely rapid and significant healing phenomena. Those who have stage one or two lung disease should take 'Lung Vitality' and pay attention to recuperation. The result will definitely restore health and there will be no risk of failure. The Life Prediction of Asthma Sufferers Physician Shen Zhaoquan Asthma is called wheezing or phlegm drinking in Chinese medicine. Its symptoms are difficulty breathing, blocked trachea, constricted lungs, unsmooth cough, and suffering that cannot be described in words. The cause of this disease is mostly chronic bronchitis. Patients include the old, the young, and the middle-aged. If it is not cured, it will occur from time to time and bind them for life. Sometimes patients also develop pulmonary tuberculosis due to weakened lungs, and there is a risk to their lives. If elderly people suffer from asthma, the lungs are prone to emphysema, which compresses the heart, leading to heart failure. One careless act can cause the heart to stop working immediately, and life is in danger. Generally, if patients have palpitations, it is a dangerous sign of asthma. Patients must pay attention to it. In the past, there were no good medicines to treat asthma, so patients suffered from it. Although there are asthma medicines sold on the market, most of them contain anesthetic ingredients, which only have a temporary effect and do not cure the root cause. Those who take it every time it occurs often develop addiction, which is especially terrifying for patients. According to the reports of most doctors, there is recently a special medicine for treating asthma called 'Holipin', which can immediately relieve wheezing and strengthen the heart. The author believes that the lungs of asthma patients are generally weak. If 'Lung Vitality' is used at the same time to strengthen the lungs, the effect will be even better, and the effect of eradicating the root cause will be doubled. Spring and Autumn: Please Close Your Mouth Tian The opposite window of the bedroom is a dance hall. Every night after the lights are turned off and I go to sleep, I look at the neon lights shining on the front of the bed, and I often think of the news that neon lights are banned on Ginza Street in Tokyo. I have not been to Japan, so I have not experienced the scenery of Ginza Street, but according to friends, Ginza Street is the busiest street in Tokyo. It is especially flavorful to stroll around there after dinner. However, on such a bustling street, once the neon lights that add to the city's brilliance are banned, its dimness can be imagined. However, for the sake of the "Hundred Years' War", it seems that there is no choice but to conserve and provide disaster relief. Neon lights were banned first, matchsticks were shortened later, and the practice of abolishing leather shoes in office buildings and wearing only wooden clogs, etc., the reaction of "punishment" was indeed a bit flustered. I saw a quick news dispatch from Hong Kong on the 22nd: According to news from Taiwan, the gold and silver utensils taken by the Japanese from the people in Taiwan amounted to more than 5 million Japanese yen in the past year. The items taken, whether wine bottles, teapots, or old coins, were all taken. They even took the gold-inlaid dentures from the people's mouths. This is really an interesting piece of news. We have a saying to describe poverty, called "Even the buttons are without copper" (in the past, copper buttons were used on clothes, such as the "suit buttons" that were popular in Shanghai for a while), but now the disaster has spread to gold-inlaid dentures, and the degree of poverty is self-evident. So, what is worrying is: After those gold-inlaid dentures are knocked off, what other ideas will they come up with? A certain newspaper used "Please Close Your Mouth" as the title of this news report. I think it is quite appropriate to give it to these "shameless" speakers. What, what, everything, everything, just "Please Close Your Mouth". The Scenery of Chinese Medicine Shops Xin Liang A Chinese medicine shop, unless it has over a thousand different medicinal herbs, from inexpensive orange peels to expensive antelope horns, bark, and minerals, is not complete enough to be called comprehensive. According to the lowest estimate, there are four hundred kinds of medicinal flavors in use every day. And according to the doctor's instructions, some medicinal materials must be soaked in honey or human milk first, and some must be boiled with salt or rice wine before they can be used. The Chinese medicine list is indeed like the catalog in a fruit store. For example, watermelon, which is used as a cold drink in summer, occupies an important position in the medicine for treating heat diseases. Other things such as lotus leaves, lotus seeds, olives (especially the dried ones from Tibet), almonds, longan, persimmons, loquats, and pears are also effective medicines for treating coughs. The Chinese medicine list is also like the list in a zoo. Tiger bones can be used as medicine, and when soaked in wine, they can treat rheumatism. Other fathers have tortoise shells, antelope horns, cicada sloughs. Deer antler (priced at 300 yuan per ounce), dead silkworms, rhino horns, scorpions and centipedes, etc. Among them, the last two types are rarely used. Among these types, there are three rare and precious things that are worth mentioning. One is maba. It is said that in the pastures of Mongolia and Manchuria, we can find a peculiar kind of horse. It often breathes deeply under the moon, and does not eat feed for several days in a row. After killing it, we can get a "treasure" that is as hard as a stone in its stomach, which is the best medicine for treating nervous diseases. Also, there are such hard lumps in the bones of cows and dogs - these three medicinal materials can only be bought in a few large pharmacies. Some other Chinese medicinal materials are like things in a grocery store. Among them are mint for treating colds, garlic for treating stomach pains, wine vinegar and salt, etc. The last one is said to be used to treat internal heat. Most Chinese medicinal materials are grass roots, while the rest are mostly stones, minerals, and shells. All kinds of medicinal materials must be purchased from specific places, although many small pharmacies also buy cheap things from other places to sell as genuine products. Medicine shops use tael as the unit. Most medicinal materials are only a few cents per tael, but a common Chinese medicine prescription for two doses always costs around one yuan. The people who work in Chinese medicine shops must undergo long-term training before they can be competent. Arranged against the wall are drawers of medicines, and each drawer contains various medicinal materials. The person dispensing medicine must first know the order in which these drawers are placed. Therefore, without three years of apprenticeship, he cannot know how a thousand different medicinal flavors are placed. Unlike foreign pharmacies where the prescription is taken to the dispensing room, the Chinese medicine shop's dispensing person dispenses various medicinal flavors in front of the customer. He first places the prescription on the counter, and then walks between the counter and the drawers. From each drawer, he takes out various different medicines and puts them on several small square pieces of paper. A common Chinese medicine prescription always has nine to thirteen medicinal flavors, so he has to come and go ten times in this way. When he weighs the last medicinal flavor, a person who checks the medicine runs over to check everything one by one to see if the dispensing person has made any mistakes. After that, he stamps a responsible seal on the prescription, and then the dispenser runs over and uses a soft piece of paper printed with the name and effect of this medicinal flavor to wrap up all the medicinal flavors. An ordinary person really doesn't know how to use a thin piece of paper four inches square to wrap a certain amount of medicine. He will definitely feel that either the paper is too small, or the paper is folded too wrinkly, or even broken. However, the gentleman in the Chinese medicine shop can wrap it very quickly. And it is very neat. Then, the dispenser wraps all kinds of packages together with a large piece of paper, puts the prescription on top, and ties it with a thin rope to complete the job. The price is usually written on the prescription. On weekdays, we can always get a 10% discount, and on the first or fifteenth day of the lunar calendar, we can get an extra 10% discount. Some Chinese medicine shops also give away jujubes or other sweets for free so that patients can relieve the bitterness after tasting the medicine soup. Now, there are also those who decoct the medicine on behalf of customers. They put the decocted medicine soup into two thermos bottles, and only charge five cents per dose. Chinese doctors rarely explain to patients whether the medicine soup should be drunk before or after meals, but most people believe that it is better to take it before meals. The efficacy of the medicine can be easily diluted by food. Translated from the English-language Great American Newspaper A Lady's Affair Bai Hua "Hard to Get" Produced by Warner Bros. Showing at the Nanjing Grand Theater To be honest, many of the "song and dance films" starring Dick Powell have not given me a good impression. His facial expressions and movements when singing are so mechanical. Some people say that Nelson Eddy has no facial expressions when singing, but Dick Powell is even worse. Moreover, perhaps he is too "loyal to art," he doesn't even choose the plays he acts in. "Spring Pastoral," which was shown in Nanjing a month ago, is a good example. Continuing to be so "loyal to art" will lead to decline. In "A Lady's Affair," Dick's change of style is definitely a fact. And with this attempt, he will receive greater success than with "song and dance films," although he is still less dashing compared to those so-called "romantic young men." "A Lady's Affair" is a typical Hollywood romantic comedy. "The girl Margaret drives away and runs out of gas on the way. She goes to a roadside gas station to add gas, but because she doesn't have cash with her, the gas station clerk Bill suspects her of scamming and forces her to sweep the bedroom to pay for it. After being humiliated, the girl decides to design a way to avenge this strange shame." Hollywood screenwriters specialize in writing plays for "playboys" and "young ladies in their boudoirs." This daughter of the wealthy businessman Richards, Margaret, pretends to be her father's maid and pretends to fall in love with Bill, causing Bill to take the blueprint for a national highway construction motel everywhere and run into walls... In the end, it is also a wisp of "affection" that "flies around" Bill and "binds them into a marriage." This story is both bland and absurd. However, Bill's plan for a national highway construction motel is finally achieved due to his indomitable spirit, even serving in a humble position. This "only by enduring the hardships of hardship can you become a superior person" is our best lesson; especially now that we are striving for the "final victory," we should adhere to this spirit. The "profit-only" attitude of capitalists is also thoroughly satirized. The rich man Richards and the banker Edward initially tried to avoid Bill's entanglement, but in the end, regardless of the danger, they went to the forty-second floor to compete with Bill for the contract. Moreover, because it is a comedy, the ugliness of Richards and Edward after their tuxedos are stripped is gratifying. The director Ray E. Enright has rich experience in handling comedies. He not only outlined a humorous and incomparable style for the entire film, but also every scene is full of strong humorous interest. Such as: the mother and daughter's quarrel at the beginning; Margaret's quarrel when forced to sweep Bill's bedroom and the car chain; Bill's rejection when he went to see Richards and Edward; Richards' dinner with Bill, Margaret disguised as a maid, the maid actually occupies the position of the young lady; and the final competition for the contract, all are light, fluent, combined with the liveliness of the lens and the humor of the dialogue, the director of "A Lady's Affair" can be said to be successful. What I especially like is the grasp of Richards' personality. His casualness and impatience, further rendered by many scenes of playing ball, fencing, boxing, wrestling, etc., are truly lifelike. Of course, Charles Winninger's acting skills cannot be ignored. Olivia Havilland doesn't seem to be as pretty as when she plays costume dramas, but the rich and lonely woman Margaret here is very cute. Announcement Buddha Mr. Yao Qixin, greetings: Received your letter of January 15th. This newspaper has changed its delivery address to No. 10 Zhuan An New Village, Yuyuan Road. However, according to the newspaper deliveryman, the new address cannot be found. If I am mistaken, please let me know in a letter. The Primary School Teachers of Shanghai Yi Primary school teachers, generally speaking, are the poorest in the education field. They are busy from morning to night, and what they earn is only enough to make a living. Although Shanghai is a prosperous city, the poverty of primary school teachers is no exception. The qualifications of primary school teachers include the following: (1) Graduates of normal schools, (2) Undergraduates of universities, (3) Graduates of middle schools, (4) Graduates of kindergarten normal schools, (5) Others. The middle school graduates mentioned above include graduates of high schools and junior high schools; kindergarten normal school graduates mostly take kindergarten teachers as their most ideal outlet, and they are all women. The other item includes former Qing scholars and those from general private schools. Although the treatment of primary school teachers varies depending on the situation of the school, generally speaking, in the past, public primary schools were better than private primary schools. Private primary schools vary their teachers' treatment depending on the development of the school and me. In general, the salary is determined by the number of teaching hours. Teachers in the first and second grades usually charge three corners per hour, those in the third and fourth grades charge four corners, and those in the fifth and sixth grades charge five corners. Therefore, the monthly income of a primary school teacher is usually around thirty yuan, and those who can earn forty or fifty yuan per month are very few. In general kindergartens, the monthly salary of female teachers who are usually directors can be about thirty-five yuan; that of assistant teachers is about twenty yuan. This refers to public schools. Private schools are probably less than this number. After the war, primary school teachers in Shanghai, with the exception of a very few, suffered a great blow. Most of their schools were in the war zone or adjacent to the war zone, so they could not start school for a while, and their lives became a problem. A few lucky ones were able to temporarily find a place to stay in schools that were not affected by the shelling, but most of them were unemployed and living a very miserable life. Later, when the environment calmed down a little, some primary schools borrowed one or two temporary classrooms from other schools in the concession to continue teaching, but the treatment of teachers was really miserable. Some primary school teachers only got four or five yuan a month for transportation expenses, which was really miserable, but the school fear was still sighing about the principal! Some primary schools started again from scratch in the concession, but the teachers' salaries were said to have had to be discounted due to the high rent. Those who used to be able to earn thirty or forty yuan can now only get about twenty yuan. Currently, because the population in the concession has increased sharply, the number of school-age children has also increased greatly, so primary school education has been able to develop particularly. There are also primary schools that have moved from the war zone to the concession, and there are also newly established ones. Some that were originally in the concession have even opened branch schools due to the large number of students. However, primary school teachers may not be able to live a slightly more comfortable life because of this. After the Rain, the Sky Clears Bao Tianxiao Chapter 2 Engineer Lin Solves Standardization Sub-Director Jin Talks About Equality He Peiyu said, "Where shall we go to eat?" Lin Jiancheng pointed at Miss Jin and said, "She is a guide, so we will just follow her. Moreover, she is more familiar with this place than anyone else. Of course, she will treat us today. We don't have to be polite, we'll just honestly bother her with a meal." Miss Jin said, "I can still afford this little treat." Sure enough, Jin Danyun led them to a place where the facade was not wide, only a small sign with the four words "Lingcun Restaurant" written on it. Walking in, the inside was extremely spacious. There was also a large hall, and it felt like there were already many people inside. The He sisters peeked over there, and Miss Jin said, "This is not where we eat, please come here with me." He Shuangyu looked up at the pillars of the corridor of the large hall, and there was also a tablet with a line of words written on it: "Cooperative Canteen of the Eighteenth Orphan School". So she asked, "Sister Danyun! Is this another place to eat?" Miss Jin nodded and said, "This is a place set aside in the restaurant for a school student union to eat. It's not good for us to go in." It turned out that since the end of the war, China had set up seventy-two orphan schools, all of which were organized by Chinese families, and even meals and accommodation were provided by the state. This large school was the Eighteenth Orphan School, from elementary school to high school. If they wanted to go to college, the orphan school would send them to various universities. Except for some elementary school students, who ate in the school's dining room and needed someone to take care of them. Middle school students organized a cooperative canteen here, which was managed by the student self-government association, but many teachers also ate here, so they took the name "Cooperative Canteen of the Eighteenth Orphan School". Now, Miss Jin led them to a back porch, which was quieter. Outside the windows of the back porch was a large expanse of green grass, which was also behind the cooperative canteen, an area where students played and strolled after meals. Looking over, beyond the sparse fence was a field of rice paddies. Although it was a back porch, it was very clean. There was also a horizontal plaque on it, with the words "Rice Fragrance" written on it. Below it, there was a couplet copied from two lines of Tang poetry: "Open the window to face the garden, raise the wine to talk about mulberry and hemp." First, Lin Jiancheng looked at it and exclaimed, "Looking at that couplet and this place, it's really perfect. Why haven't I been here before?" Miss Jin smiled and said, "How could you find such a good place? Today, it is also thanks to the two He sisters that I have brought you here." (21)

Free Talk Thorough Faction Wang Yin We have always clung to the philosophy of moderation, but sometimes we are so thorough that it is strange and eccentric. In the past, there was often a phenomenon in the literary world. If someone criticized a certain work as being bad, or said what kind of work should be produced, a hero would immediately jump out and shout, "Why don't you write it?" This is naturally very thorough. A critic should first write a work of his own ideal before he is qualified to criticize others. However, in fact, this is difficult to achieve. As a result, only the critic does not speak, and the work will always get worse or simply cannot be seen to completion, and finally become a thorough cancellation. There is also a phenomenon that if someone points out that a certain old-fashioned article is still "eight-legged essay", a hero will jump out and shout, "Those articles that only use Western allusions are also new eight-legged essays!" This is naturally also very thorough. But if the old is not good and the new is not good either, then what should we do? Except for everyone giving up, there is no other way. But it is not enough

### Arita Still Hopes for Understanding from Various Countries; Yonai Says "New Order in East Asia" Began to Be Established Ten Years Ago

(Tokyo) Navy Minister Yonai guaranteed in the House of Peers today that the Navy is fully prepared for the present and the future, and the entire house burst into applause, changing its usual dull atmosphere, and expressing the same enthusiastic emotions as the House of Representatives. Yonai declared that the establishment of a new order in East Asia did not begin today, but began ten years ago. The Japanese Navy will closely monitor the attitudes of the great powers towards the Sino-Japanese War, and has already drafted a practical plan to safeguard the principles of non-threatening and non-aggression on which the Japanese Navy's policy is based. Prime Minister Hiranuma and Foreign Minister Arita both answered questions from the questioner. Hiranuma replied that the newly established Asia Development Board will be responsible for handling political, cultural, and economic matters related to China, without interfering in Japan's foreign policy. Foreign policy will still be presided over by Foreign Minister Arita. Arita replied that the new order in East Asia has become Japan's unchangeable policy and must be promoted with all efforts to promote its implementation. Although there are still vast areas in China where foreigners can operate, due to the ongoing military operations and special measures required for strategic reasons, they have not been able to thoroughly investigate their losses, so they have doubts about Japan's actions in China. The government is now trying to seek the understanding of third countries regarding Japan's true intentions, and the way to do so is to restore the situation to normal as soon as possible, in order to show that Japan has no intention of excluding foreigners in the Far East. However, in order to clarify the situation, an early end to the military operations in China is urgently needed. Now, third countries are providing assistance to the government led by General Chiang Kai-shek, which only prolongs the war, and the purpose of clarifying the situation and protecting the rights and interests of all countries cannot be achieved. Baron Sakatani, a business tycoon and member of the House of Peers, asked the Foreign Minister after Arita's speech whether he believed that the ongoing fisheries negotiations in Moscow could be successful, and said that the Soviet government refused to conclude a fisheries agreement with Japan for two reasons: one was that "Manchukuo" did not pay five million yuan for the Chinese Eastern Railway, and the other was that Japan joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. He believed that the real reason for the suspension of this negotiation was not here, but should be sought elsewhere, so he suggested that the government should take fundamental measures to solve this problem, such as exchanging Japan's fishing rights in Soviet territorial waters for fishing rights in Northern Sakhalin.

### British Newspapers Advocate Investing in India to Save Trade with China

(London) The Financial News published an article stating that a few far-sighted people are now studying the possibility of investing in India in order to compensate for the loss of opportunities in China. As a result of the Far East conflict, India will receive greater attention in terms of both military strategy and economy. The only route for Western trade with China will likely be through Burma. If the West wants to maintain its trade with China, then the possibility of India as a manufacturing and distribution center should be studied. According to his opinion, the changes in Chinese tariffs initiated by Japan will hit all industries, especially the tobacco industry. Therefore, the large amount of tobacco from British and American merchants for the manufacture of cigarettes in China will be seriously affected. Since these merchants have already developed their export trade, moving the manufacture of cigarettes to India can preserve their business. As for the export trade of Chinese eggs and pig bristles, if it has been lost by the West, there is no reason why it cannot be transferred. Western financiers involved in this matter must pay attention to India's natural resources and seek ways to develop them. (Reuters telegram, 23rd)

### Japanese-Russian Fisheries Negotiations Still Deadlocked, But Not to the Point of Breaking Down

(Moscow) The issue of a fisheries agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union is still deadlocked. Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Shigemitsu Togo has informed Foreign People's Commissar Litvinov that if the negotiations fail, the Soviet government should be held responsible. According to the observations of informed sources, if no unexpected events occur before the start of the fishing season in April this year, the current negotiations will not break down irreparably. The crux of the problem is that the Soviet government plans to hold an auction on March 15 for the operation of the fishing grounds, and insists that the fishing grounds should be allocated by Japanese fishing companies and Soviet fishing agencies, so as to prevent the Japanese side from permanently enjoying the fishing concession rights. Although the Japanese side has not formally refused to participate in the bidding, it has already rejected the principle of allocation and insists on taking the Treaty of Portsmouth as the standard. (This treaty only allows Japan to enjoy fishing rights in the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Bering Sea, but not in other areas). However, the Soviet government denies that Japan enjoys any priority rights in Soviet territory and territorial waters, and is prepared to fully exercise its sovereignty. The formulation of fishing regulations is one aspect of sovereignty. Moreover, the Soviet side has also accused the Japanese government of being very jealous of the rapid development of the Soviet fishing industry in recent years, and is trying to obstruct it. Several years ago, both Soviet fishing boats and fishermen were lacking, and even Japanese fishermen were hired. Recently, the Soviet Union has built many fishing boats and trained fishermen, so it is naturally unwilling to allow Japan to continue its monopoly. As for the temporary fisheries agreement that expired last year, it was signed by the former Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, Hirota Koki, and the late Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Karakhan. In this agreement, Soviet fishing rights were greatly restricted. Japan only allowed the Soviet Union to have a certain tonnage of the fish caught each year as an exchange condition. It is now said that Karakhan was shot because the fisheries agreement lost its rights and was regarded as a traitor. The crux of the current fisheries problem between Japan and the Soviet Union is roughly like this. As for the issue of the work contract signed between the Soviet Sakhalin Japanese Commercial Oil Company and the Soviet trade union representatives, the negotiations have not yet been successful.

### Malaria is Prevalent in Various Counties in Southeastern Fujian

(Fuzhou) Epidemics are prevalent in Fujian Province. This year, from summer to winter, they have not been slightly curbed. Malignant malaria is the most serious. According to a recent survey, the number of people suffering from malaria in various counties in southeastern Fujian accounts for more than 10% of the total population. For example, in Anxi County, with a population of more than 100,000, more than 16,000 people suffer from malaria. In Dehua, more than 12,000 people suffer from the disease. In Jinjiang, 66,000 people suffer from the disease, and in Putian, more than 56,700 people suffer from the disease. The mortality rate is also very high. The spread is almost alarming. Various counties are working hard to prevent malaria, but because the entire territory of Fujian Province is mountainous, forested, and has heavy miasma and many mosquitoes, it is not easy to achieve results. Therefore, the number of people suffering from malaria in the entire province this year should reach one million. (Telegram, 19th)
