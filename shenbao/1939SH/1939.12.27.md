Editorial

### The Actions of the American President and the Pope

Before Christmas, US President Roosevelt announced the appointment of Mr. Taylor as his personal representative to the Vatican in Rome; tasked with working with the Catholic Church to strive for world peace; At the same time, in order to unite people of all faiths, to work for the restoration of peace and the relief of suffering humanity, he also sent letters to the leaders of Christianity and Judaism in the United States, inviting them to cooperate. Pope Pius XII, in addition to gladly accepting the personal representative of the American President, delivered a speech on the eve of Christmas calling for peace: Denouncing acts of aggression and violence, saying that they will inevitably be punished by God in the future; he also presented five basic principles for building a just peace: (1) All countries, regardless of size or strength, should have the right to exist and be independent. No country should sentence another to death for its own will to exist; (2) Countries should cooperate to gradually reduce armaments; (3) Reform international organizations and guarantee various treaties, (4) Consider in good faith the legitimate demands and needs of all countries, nations, and minorities, and satisfy them in a peaceful manner, and revise existing treaties when necessary; (5) All nations and their leaders must consider the simple and unshakable principles that conform to natural law, and consider the dignity of mankind. Three weeks ago, in the beginning of this month, in view of the three sets of wars internationally, we said that mankind urgently needs to be of one heart and one mind, pooling their wisdom and efforts, so that mistakes can be corrected in time and the evolution of sin can be stopped; We asserted that if the natural development of the current phenomenon is allowed to run its course in any aspect, it will eventually cause trouble; Therefore, we hope that the Italian monarch and ministers, the American President, the kings of the Netherlands and Belgium, and the Pope, who have worked hard for peace, will gather the greatest strength from all parties to promote a total solution to the various sets of wars; If a total solution cannot be achieved, any belligerents who take the initiative should be encouraged to be the first to accept reasonable settlement proposals. Now, the American President and the Pope have launched another initiative; We secretly hope that this is not a gospel to decorate the Christmas season, but that it will be a real benefit to humanity.

If war cannot be limited, it will inevitably lengthen and expand; If aggression cannot be punished, it will inevitably become more and more intense with impunity; If the calls for justice and peace cannot achieve effective consequences, then justice and peace will inevitably become more and more distant from the realization of their truth with each ineffective call, which also proves the recklessness of violence and only contributes to its ferocity. All these evil deeds, if they do not advance, they will retreat, and if they do not retreat, they will advance. This alternation has formed a certain pattern, a law that has lasted for thousands of years. Since the Shenyang Incident of September 18, 1931, to the battle between British and German warships on the neutral waters of America in the middle of this month; From the dawn movement of opposing imperialism and supporting weak nations, to the opportunism of colluding with the strong and seizing by trickery; From the League of Nations, within the League of Nations organization, attempting to save oneself by sophistry, to gain acceptance by power tactics, to openly tearing up various treaties and wantonly smearing the international map; The signs of this evolution have become more and more inferior, and more and more evil; The facts are like iron, and no one can deny them. Is it true that those who come gradually have been planned actions from the past to the present? Because the initial failure to prevent problems before they occur, followed by the failure to prevent them from developing, led to infection and spread, and everyone followed suit in doing evil, resulting in the extreme deterioration that we see today! However, today is still not the end of extreme deterioration. If all parties were to stand by and watch, allowing the natural development of the current phenomenon to continue; If the recent remarks of US President Roosevelt and Pope Pius XII were only to decorate the Christmas season; Then not only will the world's miserable scene next Christmas be far more cruel than this year, but tomorrow will also be far more fierce than today.

After these appeals from the American President and the Pope, we have something to appeal to the American President and the Pope: You are the outstanding authorities in the world, both materially and spiritually, and you have a sincere belief in justice and peace. Do not regard what you believe in as mere philosophy, but uphold this sincerity, with a sense of responsibility and proactive action, to promote and realize what you believe in tangibly? We certainly know that those who are insane have lost their reason and lost their normal state. It cannot be expected that peace and justice will be achieved merely by a call to action by those in authority, and that all the wise and foolish will respond in the same reasonable way. We certainly know that those with outstanding authority are not able to control and dominate everything. However, the resolution of international disputes, with regard to the specifics and techniques, awaits fair measurement and calm formulation; this is still a blank sheet of paper, with no way to ask the two sides about their claims, or to inquire about the ability of the two sides to integrate. With regard to basic principles, then the two sides in the dispute can be asked. Those who are happy to accept the principles will then cooperate to overcome difficulties and resolve the specifics and techniques, encouraging both sides with good intentions and expecting fairness from both sides. Those who are unwilling to accept the basic principles are cut off from civilized humanity and can be seen to be evil without repentance; Given the danger of intensification, they are public enemies of justice and peace; If the American President and the Pope cannot immediately launch a punitive expedition, they should exert their outstanding authority to absolutely isolate them materially and spiritually, and not allow them to harm civilized humanity; This, for those who have a sincere belief in justice and peace, under a sense of responsibility, is an action that cannot be shirked? If this is not done, what is the point of belief? What is the point of sincerity? Part of humanity is already in deep water and fire, and others are also in imminent danger; We sincerely hope that no nation or its leaders will refuse to accept the basic principles of fairness, but to ask each country in the war whether they are willing to accept the principles is something that the American President and the Pope should act on now!

### Japan's Lack of Sincerity in Negotiations with the United States Makes Renewal of Commercial Treaty Difficult - Inward Talk Reveals Weaknesses in Japanese Diplomacy - Says Further Communication is Needed with Military Leaders Invading China

Washington: The US government's silence on trade talks in Tokyo has given the impression that US-Japan talks are not as optimistic as Japan has reported. The Tokyo side said trade can continue as normal after the US-Japan trade agreement expires. US officials have said there is no evidence to support this claim. According to observers, the US is dissatisfied with the terms Japan has offered. US businessmen believe US Ambassador Grew and Nomura are engaging in trade talks. As for the current results, it is not enough to say that relations have been adjusted. Although Japan has agreed to open the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, and to compensate Americans for their losses, it is not enough for Japan to maintain normal trade relations after the expiry of the US-Japan trade agreement. (United Press dispatch from the 26th)

Washington: Japanese Ambassador to the United States Kensuke Horiuchi said yesterday that if the Japanese government is to make concessions in order to renew its commercial treaty with the United States, it must first consult with Japanese military authorities in China. Tokyo has sent a committee of military and business leaders to China to discuss the matter with Japanese military leaders in China. Ambassador Horiuchi also said that Japan's desire to conclude a new commercial treaty is a "true hope." Foreign Minister Nomura has already said that Japan wants a real deal and not verbal assurances. Ambassador Horiuchi then mentioned the US-Japan talks in Tokyo, saying that they had made great progress and that a satisfactory result was expected. (United Press dispatch from the 26th)

### American Legislators Call for Justice - Japan's Dream Has Not Yet Awakened - No Compromise Should Be Made

Washington: Senator King, a Democrat from Utah, said yesterday that the United States must make Japan abandon its dream of dominating East Asia, if we conclude a new commercial treaty with Japan, Japan must first abandon this dream, now is a good opportunity to promote peace in East Asia, but as long as Japan continues its aggression against China, I will never want the US government to shake hands with it, Four hundred million Chinese people have been forced to leave their families, and 100 million have been killed or injured. This is truly one of the most tragic chapters in human history. (United Press dispatch from the 26th)

### American Cotton Merchants Are Driven by Profit and Advocate Continuing Trade with Japan

Washington: McKesson, president of the influential American Cotton Manufacturers Association, told a United Press reporter yesterday that if the 1911 US-Japan Commercial and Navigation Treaty expires and the United States does not sign a new treaty with Japan, it will have a serious impact on US-Japan commerce. McKesson said the Cotton Manufacturers Association is eager to renegotiate a commercial deal with Japan. "If a new treaty is not signed, it will have a serious impact on US-Japan commerce. I don't believe US-Japan commerce will be destroyed as a result, but it will be a serious obstacle to US-Japan commerce." Since the German and Italian markets have been lost, Japan is still an important market for American cotton. Others say that the cotton merchants' groups have different positions on the Japanese commercial situation. They say that the Japanese business community deeply relies on American cotton merchants to maintain the status quo of US-Japan commercial relations, because Japan is the largest customer for American cotton. However, several important business groups and political experts say that the cotton merchants have not given Japan the assistance it deserves. One source pointed out that, according to US Chamber of Commerce statistics, US cotton exports account for only 5.7% of total US exports, while Japanese purchases of US cotton account for only 1.7% of total US exports. (United Press dispatch from the 26th)

### Anglo-Japanese Relations: Significant Developments Expected; Resolution of Tianjin Silver Issue: Understanding Reportedly Reached

London – According to information received yesterday by foreign embassies here regarding the Far East, Anglo-Japanese relations are on the verge of significant developments. It is generally believed that the British government will announce a resolution to the Tianjin Anglo-Japanese dispute after the New Year. It is widely believed that the two sides have reached an understanding on the silver issue, thus resolving the Tianjin case easily. Although the British side did not sacrifice major interests during the Tianjin negotiations, it is generally recalled that in July of this year, the British and Japanese sides had discussed ways to maintain security in the British concession in Tianjin. However, in August, the Japanese side demanded that the silver stored in Tianjin by the Chinese side be handed over to the Japanese side, leading to the breakdown of Anglo-Japanese negotiations. The agreed-upon method of maintaining security was shelved. It is reported that the future resolution of the Tianjin case will include a joint US-Japanese approach to maintaining security in the British concession. Japanese sources here hope that after a peaceful resolution of the Tianjin case, the British side will be able to engage with the planned "New Central Government" based on the principle of gradually restoring order. According to reporters' investigations, Chinese sources here are paying more attention to the United States' attitude towards Japan than to British concessions to Japan. (United Press report, 26th)

### Southern Ireland's Prime Minister Broadcasts to America, Responding to Roosevelt's Call; Advocates Convening an International Conference as Soon as Possible; British King Broadcasts Explanation of the Meaning of Christmas

Dublin – Éamon de Valera, President of the Executive Council of the Republic of Southern Ireland, recently broadcast a speech to the United States, advocating for "a meeting of the authorities of the governments of all belligerent nations to seek a peaceful solution," and stating that "the peoples of all nations suffering from the scourge of war are threatened with sympathy by the people of the United States and the Irish Republic. It must be known that as a result of modern warfare, all belligerent nations, whether victors or vanquished, must tighten their belts and suffer all kinds of hardships within a few years after the war. This alone means that all belligerent nations have a need to seek a solution as soon as possible. I believe that since the conference method must be tried again after the war, why not do it as soon as possible before the war has exhausted its destructive power?" (Havas report, 26th)

London – King George VI, who had continued his father's habit of broadcasting to the peoples of the British Empire every Christmas for two years, had once discontinued this practice. Yesterday, due to the war, after having lunch with the Queen and his two daughters at Sandringham Palace, he entered his study alone before 3:00 PM and gave a speech to the entire British Empire using the same radio that he had used two years ago. He said, "The Christmas we know is a festival of peace and a festival of family. All free people deeply love peace, for only peace can provide security for the family. Our true peace is in our hearts. At this time, there is a strong nation whose purpose and policies are based on aggression and oppression of what we regard as humanity's most precious possessions. This is the tragedy of today. My people have therefore risen up and shown a unity never before heard of in previous wars. Our hearts feel that we are fighting to unite people and resist evil. With this belief," people's strength is increasing day by day until victory is achieved. We are now preparing for everything in the future with steadfast spirit and belief in our families.

"We are filled with joy and gratitude at the loyalty and bravery of the British Navy. In the past few months, our navy has been at the forefront of the war. When I speak of our navy today, I am referring to all those who go to sea in the entire Empire, whether they be warships or merchant ships, from high-ranking officers to servants. In my own name and on behalf of the people, I express my gratitude and congratulations to those who have joined this great fleet. I extend the same gratitude and congratulations to the brave air force. Our air force, together with the navy, is our armor, and they are now increasing the glory of their ancestors day by day. I would also like to extend my congratulations to the Imperial Army, the soldiers from overseas, and the expeditionary force in France. Their work is difficult, and they are currently waiting. Waiting is a test of courage and discipline, but I know that once they engage in battle, they will fulfill their great duties and be worthy of the highest honor inherent in Britain. To all those who are preparing to serve the country at sea, on land, and in the air, I extend my congratulations at this time. Our vast empire, although men and women have different duties, has the same purpose: to be members of one big family and to prepare to sacrifice everything to preserve the freedom of the world. This is the spirit of our empire's self-governing dominions, India, and various territories. Aid is coming from all sides, for which the mother country is very grateful. The unity of purpose and effort is unprecedented in the world.

"I deeply believe that what unites my people with our loyal and brave allies is Christian civilization. Only on the basis of Christianity can true civilization be created. As we pass through the current dark age and create the peace that all humanity seeks, let us not forget this. The New Year is approaching. What will come with the New Year? We cannot say. If peace comes with the New Year, we will be endlessly grateful. If continued struggle comes with it, we will not be afraid. The writings of the 17th-century English writer Penn have something to inspire us. Before I end my words, I would like to recite Penn's words to the people of the country: 'I stand before the door of the New Year and tell it, "Give me light, so that I may walk safely into the unknown path." The person answers, "Enter into the darkness and place your hand in the grasp of the true Master. Thus, it is better for you than light, safer than the known path." ' I humbly pray that God guide us and protect us." (Reuters report, 26th)

### Belgian Socialist Party Congress Trusts the Government

Brussels – The Belgian Socialist Party held its 61st annual meeting here yesterday and the day before yesterday. It fully supported the government's foreign policy and unanimously passed a vote of confidence. The meeting agreed to praise the government's clear expression of the importance of the Netherlands' strict adherence to its neutrality policy and Belgium. The Socialist Party's annual meeting also passed resolutions on Belgium's economic, financial, agricultural, and social policies. During the discussion of the above-mentioned motions, all parties agreed that in the current difficult times, the interests of the whole society should be the premise and the interests of individuals should be sacrificed. Therefore, it was regretted that the privileged classes refused to accept this spirit of sacrifice. The meeting then called on the government to strictly control munitions and arsenals. Although it criticized the incomplete construction of Belgium's air defense, it also solemnly stated that the state's financial burden made it impossible to complete air defense construction. The socialist members of the current cabinet demanded that the government take a firm stance and support the expansion of social legislation. After the agenda of the Socialist Party's annual meeting was completed, a simple memorial ceremony was held to commemorate Vandervelde, who was one of the founders of the Belgian Socialist Party and served as its chairman for thousands of years. He passed away a year ago. (Haitong report, 26th)

Paris – According to a spokesperson for the General Headquarters, a total of 1,438 French officers and soldiers were killed in action from the beginning of the war to November 30th. 2,511 British officers and soldiers were killed in action during the same period. This shows that the German side's claim that the current war is solely the responsibility of France is a slander. (Havas report, 6th)

### Hundreds of Soviet Planes Bomb Southern Finland; Finnish Capital Also Bombed Twice; Ten Soviet Planes Shot Down

Helsinki – Hundreds of Soviet planes flew to Finland yesterday to drop bombs everywhere to celebrate Christmas. Residents of the Finnish capital were forced to spend their holiday in bomb shelters. In addition to the Finnish capital, key railway points and several major cities were bombed. It is reported that no fewer than 13 Soviet planes were shot down yesterday. One crashed outside the city of Finland. The Finnish capital was attacked twice by 30 enemy planes, which attempted to destroy the Finnish capital's airfield, but failed. One key point that received the most attention from enemy planes was the Ruohimäki railway junction. In the town of Porvoo on the coast of the Gulf of Finland, nine civilians were killed by bombing. (Reuters report, 26th)

Helsinki – Yesterday was Christmas Day. Soviet aircraft formations came twice in the morning and afternoon to bomb, mostly dropping bombs in the northern suburbs. Fortunately, there were no casualties. Until 1:45 PM today, the city issued another air raid warning. Residents went into air raid shelters, and their attitude was calm. As of the time of the dispatch, no enemy aircraft had been found, but the weather today is severely cold, and visibility is poor. Even if enemy aircraft come, I am afraid they will not be able to use their skills. In addition, many cities inland were bombed yesterday, and a large number of civilians were killed. For example, the town of Porvoo, which is only 50 miles away from here, has no garrison and no industry. It has no military value. The normal population of residents is only 7,000. Since the war, many women and children in the capital have fled to this place. It was also bombed yesterday, killing 9 and injuring 38. In other cities like Åbo, one person was killed and 13 were injured. There was no major damage to the port of Viipuri. It has been confirmed that ten enemy aircraft were shot down. (Havas report, 26th)

Helsinki – As a Christmas gift, the Soviets launched a fierce attack on the center of the Mannerheim Line at 3:00 AM yesterday. The Soviets fired 200 bullets per minute at Finnish positions. About 900 shock troops. The Finns fought hard, and the Soviets failed to succeed. The reporter spent Christmas Eve on the front line. The weather was severely cold, at minus 10 degrees. For those of you who spend the holiday in a warm, bright, and comfortable home, the reporter really does not know what words to use to write about the situation on the front line. The sky was bright with a high moon, and the ground was covered with four inches of snow. Finnish officers and soldiers were not celebrating because they were planning how to resist the Soviet offensive, as the Soviets would take advantage of this holiday to attack. (United Press report, 25th)

### Glimpse of the Battle Situation on the Finnish Front

Helsinki – Tall fir trees reach the sky, the sky shows a sad color, and the mountain slopes are covered with snow, stretching endlessly. This was Christmas Day on the northern front line of the Soviet-Finnish war yesterday. The reporter looked out over "no man's land" from a Finnish artillery fort on a high ground, and felt that the scenery was not fierce. A Finnish officer pointed to a mountain slope opposite and said to me, "There are Russian troops there. You cannot see them, but they cannot see you either. Later, you will notice their tracks." As soon as the officer finished speaking, there was an explosion in the distance. Therefore, the officer explained that this was the Russian army shelling a certain location in the forest, as the end of ten days of fierce fighting, because the Russian army is now retreating. The occasional artillery fire is nothing more than wanting us to know that they have not retreated yet. Even their retreat is not easy. The reporter asked if the Russian army would come back. The officer replied that they would not come back anytime soon. There are about one division of Soviet troops on the front line of Lake Sala, or 15,000 people. According to Finnish estimates, at least half of this division has been killed or wounded. Near the place I visited, there was a fierce battle three days ago. In this battle, 600-700 Soviet troops were killed. While we were talking, a Finnish ski commando wearing white clothes passed by us, and then we heard the sound of machine guns firing in the distance. The officer laughed and said, "What are their targets? They are only shooting elk in the forest!" However, when the reporter drove a white-painted vehicle to the front line, he saw that those killed by the Soviets were not only elk, but also Finnish soldiers. When I drove back from the front, I saw many camps, each of which could accommodate 26 people. They were all well hidden, so that from a few feet away, you would not know that they were camps for soldiers to live in. All that could be seen were branches of trees. In addition, the Finnish soldiers' ability to withstand the cold is very amazing. (United Press report, 26th)

Helsinki – Finnish officials today recounted the battle situation in the first three weeks of the war, saying that the Soviets had suffered extremely heavy losses in this war, often with entire armies annihilated. Although the enemy generals drove their troops to approach, they were blocked by the firepower of the defenders, and corpses were all over the field. More than 200 enemy tanks were destroyed or captured, and dozens of enemy planes were shot down. Dozens of artillery pieces and hundreds of machine guns were also captured. Although the Finnish army also suffered casualties, they were fewer than the Soviets. The Soviets suffered heavy losses on the Mannerheim Line and the Karelian Isthmus, paying a great price for every inch of ground they gained. The Finnish air force demonstrated its brave skills in the air battles over the Karelian Isthmus, inflicting heavy damage on the Soviet air force. The Soviets repeatedly tried to break through the Finnish lines, but failed in every place. North of Lake Ladoga, the enemy's pressure was very strong. After the Finnish army withdrew from its outposts, it was deployed along the Lomo-La area. Although the Soviets launched a fierce attack, they were ultimately ineffective. At present, the Finnish army and air force are showing their unwavering fighting spirit and are giving the enemy and the world evidence of the Finnish defenders' loyalty, bravery, and patriotism. (Reuters report, 25th)

(4) Soviet aircraft flew over our positions for reconnaissance and bombed our fortress artillery positions, but all attempts failed. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)

### Captured German Ship Flies British Flag - Sails Through Panama Canal - U.S. Authorities Take Special Precautions - Eighteen Ships of Various Countries Sunk in the Past Week

Balboa, Panama - A large crowd stood on the banks of the Panama Canal yesterday to watch the captured 4,930-ton German ship "Düsseldorf" pass through, marking the first captured prize by the British Navy to pass through the Panama Canal. The ship had previously been captured by the British destroyer "Despatch" off the coast of Chile. As it passed through the canal, the British naval flag flew above the swastika flag at the stern. British sailors with rifles and bayonets patrolled the deck. Many spectators cheered. Due to rumors that Germans on board might attempt to run the ship aground in the narrow parts of the canal, U.S. authorities took special precautions, guiding it with a tugboat. It was towed forward as it passed the Culebra Cut turn, for fear that the ship would run aground. Usually, ships passing through this turn do not require towing by other ships. (Reuters Dispatch, 26th)

### Protests Against Violations of the American Neutral Zone May Not Be Effective - Britain and France Consistently Demand the Preservation of All Rights

London - Regarding the violation of the American "neutral zone," the twenty-one American republics submitted notes to the governments of Britain, France, and Germany yesterday to protest. These notes have not yet arrived here, but well-informed political sources have just clarified the views held by Britain and France regarding the "neutral zone," stating that if the purpose of the American countries' actions is to prompt the belligerent countries to issue formal declarations explaining their attitudes, then Britain and France will exchange views in a short period of time to determine a policy, so that they can submit a reply in an appropriate manner. As it stands now, Britain and France consistently reserve all rights regarding this "neutral zone," because those countries believe that, in order to be fair to the decision of the Pan-American Conference regarding the delineation of the neutral zone, it must be applied equally to all belligerent countries. Therefore, the twenty-one American republics must take strict supervisory measures to ensure the neutrality of the 300-mile sea area along the American continent and prevent German warships from engaging in any illegal activities within this range, since Germany has always disregarded the law and "strict supervision is necessary to ensure that it respects international order." Based on this, the future of the American "neutral zone" depends on whether the sea supervision measures can be fully effective. Given that the American countries do not hold prejudices against Britain and France, a satisfactory solution can still be found. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)

New York - Regarding the violation of the American neutral zone, after the American governments lodged protests to the belligerent countries yesterday, the morning newspapers here commented on it, with some saying that its wording was too vague and others saying that it was unlikely to be effective. The New York Public Opinion Forum reported that it was unlikely that the belligerent countries would accept the note. The belligerent countries, compelled by the necessity of warfare, had to take certain actions. As the American countries had failed to take this into account, and their attitude was somewhat lacking in basis under international law, it was unlikely that it would be effective. It also argued that those who advocated setting up the neutral zone were too shortsighted about the current war, as the American countries would be in a position to fall into a state of war. The New York Times reported that the neutral zone delineated by the Pan-American Conference encompassed the sea area within 300 miles of the American continent. Its area was so vast that it would be very difficult for the American countries to carry out police duties within it in practice. "In short, whether this neutral zone can be put into practice depends on two factors: first, whether the American countries can make the belligerent countries understand that combat in the neutral zone on the sea off the coast of Asia will arouse public opinion in the American countries, and at the same time convince them that the American countries will formulate regulations so that neither side of the belligerent countries will be uniquely disadvantaged." (Havas Dispatch, 26th)

### Mobile Front Line of the Nationalist Army in Western Zhejiang - The Nationalist Army Achieves Great Battlefield Successes - The Japanese Army Has Become a Spent Arrow

Jinhua Correspondence - The alluvial plains of western Zhejiang, long known as the land of fish and rice, a wealthy area, now have twelve and a half counties and one city occupied. Counting from the day Hangzhou City was abandoned (Hangzhou City fell on December 24, 1937, the last temporarily abandoned piece of national territory in western Zhejiang), it has been two years today.

For the past two years, considering the front-line positions of the two armies facing each other, from Wuhu Digang on the left to Fuyang Yuhang on the right, with Xuan City as the endpoint in the middle, this front line has not only not changed, but in some places, the Japanese army has shortened its defensive line. Taking only western Zhejiang, the Japanese troops in Fuyang and Yuhang have been forced to retreat from some of their outer strongholds. This proves that since China's resistance against Japan for two years, it has been impossible for the Japanese army to expand its battlefield achievements, and it is difficult to maintain its occupation of the "surface" area. The end of the strong crossbow cannot pierce the Lu silk.

The Era of Guerrilla Warfare Begins

After the fall of Hangzhou, the Japanese army stopped on the north bank of the Qiantang River, facing the Nationalist army across the water, with Yuhang and Fuyang as its left and right flanks, to consolidate Hangzhou. During this period, both armies focused on internal reorganization, and both sides lived in peace. Within three months, there were no major battles on the front line, only sporadic artillery battles to punctuate the silent atmosphere. In March 1938, the headquarters of the 7th Army Group of the Nationalist Army and the military authorities of Zhejiang Province agreed on a plan to launch guerrilla warfare in western Zhejiang, and successively sent teams to cross the river to the north, leading local armed forces, distributed in areas such as Haiyan, Haining, Pinghu, and Jiaxing. The virgin guerrilla warfare of western Zhejiang began there. Every point on every highway was often sabotaged by the Nationalist army, and all waterways were blocked. Teams were also sent to cross the railway line, controlling both sides of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, and constantly attacking it. The capture of Haiyan County on May 15 can be said to have opened a new page in the history of guerrilla warfare in western Zhejiang. Later, Haiyan was lost and regained many times, and this "guerrilla city" became a county that the people of Zhejiang paid special attention to.

In total, there were more than 200 fierce guerrilla battles in the past year. A total of 9,000 Japanese troops were annihilated in various places. The roadbeds and surfaces of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, the Jiaxing-Huzhou Highway, and the Pinghu-Zha Pu Highway were damaged more than 200 times. More than 50 bridges were blown up, and 80 or 90 motorboats and ships were sunk or captured. More than 50 cars were destroyed or captured. Dozens of steel cannons and more than 30 heavy machine guns were intercepted. Except for the west side of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, western Zhejiang is mostly a plain area, with crisscrossing harbors and rivers, which is not very suitable for guerrilla warfare, so the above achievements can be considered very satisfactory. This was exchanged for the blood and flesh of heroic soldiers, and this achievement finally laid the foundation for the guerrilla area in western Zhejiang.

A New Posture for the Guerrilla Area

The guerrilla warfare in western Zhejiang in the past year has moved from the founding period to the second stage, and its strength has gradually increased, but there are still many shortcomings that need to be strengthened. Therefore, the military authorities decided to reorganize and adjust the combat troops back to the south bank in batches for reorganization and replenishment. On the other hand, after the establishment of the Western Zhejiang Administrative Office, it also made a decision on some "old-fashioned" local guerrilla teams, incorporating and training them to become elite troops. The face of western Zhejiang has been completely renewed.

Starting in the spring of this year, new military operations by the Nationalist side began again. Most of the new forces advanced to the rear of the Japanese army. The line from the south bank of the Qiantang River to the south bank of the Fuchun River, and the line on the west side of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, were more powerful than before. In April, the Japanese army's sharp edge was repeatedly frustrated between Wukang and Wuxing in the southern section of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. In June, the battle of Hushu shocked the Japanese puppet regime. In September, two Japanese military trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road were blown up one after another, and the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. In the same month, in the battle on the border of Jiangsu, Xie Zhijun, the deputy commander of the puppet pacification forces, was captured alive. In October, they rushed into Hangzhou City and achieved brilliant battle results. In November, the counter-encirclement battles of Wuxing, Chongde, and Tongxiang were successful. These were all larger battles in the past eleven months. The remaining small-scale guerrilla battles occur every day.

In the past eleven months of guerrilla warfare this year, the battle in which we rushed into Hangzhou City last month and the anti-encirclement battle in western Zhejiang in November have been somewhat successful in terms of strategy and tactics. For example, in the battle of rushing into Hangzhou City, the various troops were able to echo each other and cooperate closely. For example, in the counter-encirclement battle in western Zhejiang, the Nationalist army avoided internal operations and conducted a Go-style guerrilla war, breaking out of the encirclement and adopting a counter-encirclement formation, and also received the response of the Nationalist army on the southeast side of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and the west side of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. The Zhejiang Eastern troops also crossed the river to the north to attack Hangzhou, causing the Japanese army to be besieged everywhere, with enemies on all sides, resulting in collapse.

The Japanese Army Actively Returns With Its Wings Clipped

From March last year to November this year, the so-called "sweeping" battles adopted by the Japanese army in western Zhejiang are unknown. Among them, the larger ones include the battles of Anji, Xiaofeng, and Changxing in March last year, in which the Japanese side mobilized 10,000 people. The result was that more than 2,000 Japanese troops were captured by the Nationalist army. In early August, in the battle of Jiaxing and Haiyan, the Japanese army mobilized 5,000 or 6,000 troops and encountered a serious blow from the Nationalist army. As a result, only an empty city of Haiyan was obtained, but it was soon captured by the Nationalist army taking advantage of the vacancy. In October, the Japanese army in western Zhejiang "swept" the area and mobilized 4,000 or 5,000 troops, but the Nationalist army launched a counter-sweeping operation in 23 routes, giving the Japanese army a strong response. In March of this year, the Japanese army again "swept" the area with a mobilized force of 5,000 troops. After being severely beaten by the Nationalist army, they were forced to retreat. In November, in the battle of Wuxing, Chongde, and Tongxiang, the Japanese army mobilized 4,000 or 5,000 troops, attempting to "annihilate" a certain unit of the Nationalist army in one fell swoop, but it was counter-encircled by the Nationalist army, fought fiercely for seven days, and returned with its wings clipped.

### Japanese Army Attempts to Invade Nantian - Repelled by Nationalist Garrison

Nantian Correspondence - Nantian is an isolated island, located at the mouth of Sanmen Bay, and is the smallest county in Zhejiang Province. Since the war of resistance, although Japanese planes and warships have passed through from time to time, it has not been disturbed until now. At about 8:00 AM on the 20th of this month, two Japanese warships were discovered on the sea near Gaotang Longquan Bay in the county. At about 10:00 AM, three motorboats were lowered, carrying 30 to 40 soldiers, and under the cover of artillery fire from the warships, they forcibly landed at Jinjia Chair of Zhumen Port. The Nationalist defending forces rose up to fight fiercely. The two sides fought fiercely until about 12:00 noon, when the Japanese army was repelled and fled back to the warships. The Japanese warships also retreated immediately. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than a dozen casualties, while the Nationalist side suffered very little losses.

### Japanese Troops Retreat Almost Completely from Four Suburbs of Suzhou

Suzhou Correspondence - In recent days, the Japanese troops stationed in Suzhou have become increasingly scarce. Even during the daytime, Japanese troops are rarely seen on the main streets. As for the Japanese troops originally stationed in Chenmu, Jiaozhi, Xietang, etc., they have now withdrawn almost completely. Currently, a very small number of troops are stationed at the old site of the Huayuan Hotel outside Lumen. In addition to a hundred or so people stationed near the train station, the Japanese troops in the old barracks of the Fifth Regiment departed for other places in the first ten days of this month. At the same time, due to the emptiness of the defenses, the Japanese army ordered the Second Brigade of the puppet provincial police to be reorganized into the puppet army, under the command of the puppet pacification commander Gong Guoliang. Due to the lack of firearms, the Japanese side has now allocated 300 old-style rifles and designated them to be stationed at Xikuatang and Muduzhen outside Xumen.

### Japanese Army Spies on Qidong - Attempt to Land Fails

Qidong Correspondence - In the county's coastal Lingdian Port and Sanhe Port, the Japanese army occasionally comes to these places, attempting to land, but they have been prevented by the Provincial Security × Brigade defending forces in those places. On the 3rd of this month, two Japanese warships suddenly came outside Lingdian Port and immediately landed by motorboat, but they were still swept by machine guns by the × Brigade, preventing them from approaching the shore. The Japanese army fired dozens of artillery shells, and two Nationalist soldiers were killed and one was injured, but the remaining soldiers, seeing that the Japanese artillery fire was fierce, still vowed not to retreat, so the Japanese army was unable to land and retreated immediately. On the 4th, three Japanese warships came to Sanhe Port again, preventing merchant ships from approaching the shore and forcibly dragging away several civilian boats, landing immediately. They were swept by machine guns by the soldiers of the Provincial Security × Regiment. The Japanese army, seeing that the situation was fierce and the boatmen were injured by bullets, retreated back to the warships.

### Pudong Guard Trench Battles: Japanese Actually Use Poison Gas, Chinese Guerrillas Fight Bravely, Almost Entire Japanese Puppet Army Stationed There Annihilated

Since the beginning of this month, guerrilla forces have launched a large-scale offensive along the coastal areas of Pudong, with the fiercest fighting occurring in the Hutung area. Japanese puppet troops have suffered extremely heavy casualties, and the fighting has only recently stopped. The Japanese, realizing their strength was insufficient, temporarily suspended operations on the Shangchuan Road, transferring nearly a thousand Japanese soldiers from the city center, equipped with sophisticated weaponry, to rush to the rescue. However, the guerrilla forces led by Gu Lifeng and others fought bravely and refused to yield. In desperation, the Japanese army resorted to using poison gas, causing significant casualties to the guerrilla forces. However, during the fighting, almost all of the original stationed Japanese puppet troops were annihilated. Currently, the Hutung and Sanzhao areas are still occupied by Japanese puppet forces.

Puppet Police Expand Jurisdiction of Pudong Police

The puppet "garrison" is actively attempting to control "police powers" on the water. In addition to establishing a "Water Patrol Headquarters" on Dongchang Road in Pudong, which dispatches several unarmed "police" in sampans to patrol the Huangpu River daily, competing for authority with the existing Customs Water Patrol, it has recently expanded its influence beyond the original urban areas. "Detachments" have been established in Chongming and Minhang, one in Wusong, one in Beixinjing, one in Yangjing in Pudong, and one at Guanqiao in Nanshi, all of which were announced on the previous day. Each "detachment" has two shifts of unarmed "water police" stationed within.

Japanese Wounded Soldiers Cannot Be Accommodated

Recently, tens of thousands of wounded Japanese soldiers have been transported back from the front lines to the rear in central China. As a result, Japanese wounded soldier hospitals in Shanghai are unable to accommodate them. Therefore, in Nanshi, in addition to the Lushan Hospital on Longhua Road being occupied as a wounded soldier hospital and already filled, a portion of the Wan Zhu School building in the city has also been converted into a convalescent hospital for wounded soldiers. This is still insufficient, so over thirty civilian houses in Longmen Village on Shangwen Road, totaling over one hundred rooms, have been requisitioned, all connected, and converted into a wounded soldier hospital. Construction has now been completed, but the wounded soldiers have not yet been moved in. Furthermore, the Japanese have also built a large-scale crematorium in Paotaiwan, Wusong. According to visitors, dozens or over a hundred bodies are burned to ashes daily, placed in jars, and transported back to Japan. Recently, the Japanese have also newly opened a crematorium in the Tiantong’an area.

### International Relief Committee Emphasizes Production Work, Admonishes Refugees in Various Centers

The Shanghai International Relief Committee previously noted that refugees in the shelters had nothing to do, making them prone to developing habits of laziness. It therefore specifically formulated measures for mandatory production, which has proven effective since its implementation. Recently, due to the passage of time, instances of negligence have been discovered. Deeply concerned about failing the enthusiastic relief efforts of society, the committee issued a notice, sternly reprimanding and rectifying the situation. The committee also hopes that various factories and businesses will be concerned about the purpose of refugee production and recruit them at any time, so as to achieve the benefit of mutual relief. The notice is transcribed below. Its purpose is to reduce the burden on society, in line with the original intention of relief, and to enable refugees with the ability to work to gain a basis for self-reliance, so that when the shelters are dissolved in the future, they can use their skills to avoid starvation. This good intention should be deeply understood by all refugees. However, according to recent findings, a woman who was referred to a carpet factory for work at the time of admission actually refused to be bound by the factory, arbitrarily refusing to work without reason. These people believe that the shelters provide food and clothing, leaving them with no worries and complete freedom of action. After a careful investigation by the committee, this was found to be true. According to the previously established regulations on mandatory production work for refugees, she should have been immediately expelled from the shelter. However, considering her youth and lack of awareness of the seriousness of the matter, the shelter director has instructed her family members to record a major demerit each. From now on, if any of the above occurs with refugees who have the ability to work, not only will the offending person be immediately expelled, but their family members will also be ordered to leave the shelter as a warning to parents who indulge their children and those who are lazy and content with abandoning themselves. In addition to instructing the shelters to comply, this notice is hereby circulated for general information.

### Report of German Planes Bombing London Not Confirmed, Transmitted by San Francisco Radio Station

The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reports that rumors of German planes carrying out a large-scale air raid on London yesterday (December 25th) could not be confirmed in this city. This rumor was first transmitted to Shanghai by the Treasure Island Radio Station in San Francisco. Most people in this city believe that an air raid alarm may have occurred in London yesterday afternoon, but no German planes appeared.

### French Troops Stationed in Tianjin Withdraw to Shanghai to Return Home, French Headquarters to Move to Shanghai

Tianjin, 26th (Domei News Agency) – Approximately six hundred French colonial troops stationed in Tianjin, who are withdrawing from North China to the western front of France, departed from Tianjin at noon on the 26th on a special train to Qinhuangdao. They are scheduled to take a ship from there, passing through Shanghai and Annam, to return to their home country. Furthermore, their headquarters will move to Shanghai. The remaining troops will be commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Worno.

### Soybean and Rice Merchants Suggest Citywide Grain Registration, All Rice Arrived Domestically and Rice Arrived from Overseas Must Be Registered Within Five Days or Considered Hoarding, Municipal Council Believes Grain Storage Should Be Managed by Rice Merchants

The Shanghai Soybean Industry Association and Rice Merchants Association, recognizing that high rice prices affect security in the concession, held a joint meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM on the third floor of the Miscellaneous Grain and Oilcake Exchange at 15 Edward Road. The meeting was attended by representatives Chen Ziyi, Xing Zhigang, Zhu Yunchang, Shi Hongxun, Huang Zhihe, Jiang Hongbin, Fu Qiangeng, Zhu Xiangsheng, Yan Xiaoquan, Xing Zhigang, Zhu Zifan, Cao Xinggeng, She Bingwen, Gu Yisheng, Zhang Lizhong, Jin Zhaoyun, Pan Jibin, Lu Wenshao, Wang Tianchou, and others, a total of eighteen people. Xing Zhigang was elected as the temporary chairman. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting and the current rice market situation, followed by each attending member rising to contribute their opinions. Discussions then began on: (1) The suggestion to the Food Regulation Association to handle rice registration. It was resolved that the Food Regulation Association should publish an announcement in the newspaper that all rice arrived domestically and rice arrived from overseas, whether arrived or not, should be registered with the association within five days, or it would be considered hoarding. (2) A letter should be sent to the Food Regulation Association urging it to quickly organize discounted rice sales. It was resolved that a letter should be sent to the Food Regulation Association urging it to quickly order cheaper overseas rice and collect the existing low-quality overseas rice and broken rice in Shanghai, and immediately organize discounted sales to help the common people. (3) A letter should be sent to the Food Regulation Association urging it to quickly expand the purchase of overseas rice. It was resolved that the Food Regulation Association is already organizing group purchases of overseas rice, but the association believes that it is necessary to expand the purchases, with each trade association as a unit. A letter should be sent to the association urging it to supervise each association to consider the food needs of Shanghai residents and work hard. If each association orders several thousand bags, the Shanghai food supply can be increased by hundreds of thousands of bags, and the city will not be short of supplies. In addition, a fundraising committee was established to raise funds for ordering overseas rice. The meeting adjourned at around 7:00 PM.

Rice Market Trends Towards Stability, Market Resumes Operations

The Rice Market Tea House Market, in commemoration of National Renaissance Day and to celebrate the Christmas holiday, the market management committee resolved to close for one day on the day before. Yesterday, operations resumed, and the market opened as usual at 9:00 AM. Rice shops were weak, and trading was not brisk. Rice shops in all districts have successively resumed operations in accordance with the authorities' wishes. It is understood that there are approximately 1,133 rice shops in the city, including 302 in the British Concession, 263 in the American Concession, and 146 in the western Shanghai area. All of these rice shops are formal members of the Rice Merchants Association.

Authorities Respond to Grain Storage Proposal

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation previously suggested to the authorities of the two concessions that they purchase and store grain as a precaution, considering the serious food situation. In addition to the French Municipal Council expressing sympathy, the federation received a reply from the Public Concession Municipal Council on the previous day, stating, "In response to your esteemed letter, it has been given sympathetic consideration by the council. It is the council's opinion that the establishment of grain warehouses is a good idea and the council fully agrees if it can be realized. However, it is the council's consistent principle that the operation of any goods should be undertaken by the business community. The establishment of grain warehouses is part of the rice business, so rice merchants should be responsible for it. The council is unable to engage in grain storage plans under the current circumstances. We have heard that private organizations are already purchasing overseas rice, and the council is very satisfied. What the council dares to tell your federation is that the council will give possible encouragement and convenience to those who purchase overseas rice."

Regulation Association Registers and Orders Rice

The Shanghai Food Regulation Association has passed fundraising measures, established advisory, purchasing, and fundraising committees, and hired a secretary. It will begin operations immediately and will begin registering orders for overseas rice today (December 27th). The measures for ordering overseas rice and application forms have been printed. Any organizations, agencies, companies, or factories that wish to order overseas rice can obtain application forms from the association (59 Hong Kong Road, Room 304) and fill them out according to the instructions.

### A Certain University Staff Member, Huang Xionglüe, is Shot, Hit by Two Bullets and Seriously Injured, Reasons for Assassination Still Under Investigation

Huang Xionglüe, from Chaozhou, Guangdong, is 29 years old this year. He formerly served as the director of the Secretariat of South China University. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, he was introduced by a friend to work in the General Affairs Department of a certain university on Kangnao Road. Having been married for only three months, he rented a room on the third floor of the Ye family's house at No. 3 Hexing Lane, 42 Shanzhong Road in the French Concession. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Huang

left his residence, intending to go to the school to handle affairs. Unexpectedly, just as he stepped to the entrance of Hexing Lane, several thugs lying in wait there suddenly rushed out from the side. One of the thugs, wearing a gray suit and a black woolen coat, pulled out a pistol and fired four shots at Huang. Huang

was hit by one bullet in his right shoulder and another in his left waist. After being injured, he turned and ran back to the entrance of his residence, shouting for help. His wife heard the sound and ran out, intending to report to the patrol post. At this time, the thugs had not yet fled. Seeing Huang's wife running out, they raised their guns to shoot at her, but the bullet jammed. In fright, Huang's wife

shouted loudly and fell to the ground to avoid the bullets. At this time, passersby and patrolmen had heard the sound and gathered. The assassins had taken the opportunity to escape without a trace. The police then reported to the French Police Station by telephone, and an ambulance was immediately called to send Huang to Guangci Hospital. It is reported that Huang's bullets did not pass through

and that he was seriously injured and his life may be in danger. The police station has dispatched detectives to investigate the reason for Huang's assassination and to apprehend the criminals. It is also reported that Huang, while handling school affairs, was a patriotic person and had been threatened several times but refused to give in, which aroused suspicion from certain quarters. Before being shot yesterday morning, the thugs had tried to kidnap him but failed, so they shot him. As for the inside story, it is currently under investigation by the French Police Station.

According to the English-language "Great American Evening Post," a professor at a certain university, Huang Xionglüe, resides at No. 3, Lane 42, Shanzhong Road. This morning (December 26th), as he left his residence and had only walked a few steps, he was suddenly shot twice by two assassins. Huang was hit by one bullet in the stomach, and another bullet grazed his left arm, causing minor injuries. At the time of the incident, an elderly vendor was nearby and saw the two assassins loitering nearby before the incident, and witnessed the shooting. However, in a state of shock, he could only raise the alarm and report to the patrol after the two assassins boarded

a car parked on the side of the road and fled. The injured person was rushed to Guangci Hospital by ambulance. An operation was performed this morning. According to doctors, Huang's injuries are not serious and he should be able to recover. The case is still a mystery. Reliable sources in this city believe that there were political motives. However, Huang, when questioned by the French Concession Police Department, stated that he had no connection to politics

nor had he received any threatening letters. The motive for the shooting may be personal jealousy. According to the French Concession Police Department, Huang left his residence just after 9:00 AM this morning and was shot by assassins a few minutes later. The vendor who witnessed the event has been taken to the French Police Station for questioning.

### Certificates of Chinese Goods Must Not Be Issued Indiscriminately, Should Be Handled by the Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Has Separate Regulations

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday to various trade associations, stating, "In response to the notice, we have recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Commercial Affairs Department, No. 39679, December, which states: Regarding the matter of certificates of Chinese goods, the Ministry has previously received a telegram from your Chamber of Commerce proposing provisional measures for issuing lists of Chinese goods certificates. The Ministry has made revisions, approved the implementation, and ordered compliance. In the future, regarding the matters of Chinese goods certificates within the Shanghai city area as stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the above-mentioned measures, your Chamber of Commerce should immediately handle them in accordance with the above-mentioned measures, and inform all other trade associations and Chinese goods manufacturers' organizations that they must not issue Chinese goods certificate lists indiscriminately. You are hereby ordered to comply. "The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's provisional measures for issuing lists of Chinese goods certificates proposed by the Chamber have been reviewed and revised by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. However, the format of the certificate lists, which are related, is still under review by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Therefore, the articles of the measures for the certificate lists have not been notified to the associations in advance. In response to the above, the entire text of Article 2 of the measures is extracted and notified, hoping that you will investigate and handle them first. Attached is Article 2 of the provisional measures for issuing lists of Chinese goods certificates: For industrial products manufactured independently by Chinese factories in the Shanghai city area that have obtained certificates of Chinese goods from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and wish to sell them abroad or to various ports in China, they may apply to the Chamber for a list of Chinese goods certificates in accordance with these measures. The scope of the Shanghai city area is temporarily limited to the safe area within the two special districts and will be determined at any time depending on the actual situation. Article 3 states: For industrial products that have not yet obtained certificates of Chinese goods from the Ministry of Economic Affairs due to urgent shipping reasons, they may also apply to the Chamber for a list of Chinese goods certificates in accordance with these measures. However, within two months from the date of obtaining the list, they should apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for a certificate of Chinese goods in accordance with the prescribed procedures."

### Drawing of the National Reconstruction Bond Scheduled, Principal and Interest Over 11,540,000 Yuan, Payment Methods to be Announced by the Ministry of Finance at the Time

In order to complete the legal tender policy, improve financial organization, support production and construction, balance national treasury revenue and expenditure, and allocate funds for stabilizing the bond market, the National Government issued the 25th Year of the Republic of China National Reconstruction Bond of 340 million yuan, with the customs surplus designated as the fund for principal and interest. The Ministry of Finance ordered the Director General of Customs to allocate the principal and interest due each month according to the principal and interest repayment schedule to the National Debt Fund Management Committee account of the Central Bank for special storage and payment. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the customs of Shanghai and Tianjin fell one after another, and customs duties were intercepted by the Japanese. Therefore, the principal and interest of the bond were forced to be temporarily suspended. However, in order to maintain creditworthiness, the seventh installment of principal and interest was discounted and paid by the four banks: Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank. The eighth drawing of principal repayment is scheduled for the 10th of the month by the National Debt Fund Management Committee, totaling 1.7 million yuan for principal repayment and 9,843,000 yuan for interest payment, with a total of 11,543,000 yuan for principal and interest. Payment will begin on February 28th. As for the payment methods, they will be announced by the Ministry at that time.

### Chinese Seamen Returning Home From Abroad, Travel Expenses are High, Living Conditions are Poor

Over three hundred Chinese seamen who served on foreign merchant ships and became unemployed after the war have arrived in Shanghai one after another. According to the reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency, the seamen who returned to Shanghai have been helped by various shipping organizations to find other means of livelihood. However, during this period of sparse foreign shipping, there are few suitable opportunities. Therefore, the majority of the seamen have recently gone to Zhejiang separately and transferred to their hometowns to seek other development opportunities. It is also understood that most of these seamen have served on German and Italian ships for many years. Before the war, their average monthly income was about 100 Chinese legal tender yuan, so their livelihoods were still relatively comfortable. After the war, the ships stopped sailing, and their livelihoods were not a problem for a short time. However, the travel expenses for returning home cost an average of 1,000 yuan per person. Therefore, their living conditions are extremely poor after returning home.

### Tax-Exempt Exports Exceeded Taxable Exports Last Month, Incentives for Exports Show Obvious Results

The Customs announced the value of goods taxed and exempted for import and export in November of this year: (1) Taxable imports: 27,866,254 gold units, tax-exempt imports: 3,443,199 gold units; (2) Taxable exports: 61,975,858 yuan, tax-exempt exports: 71,739,192 yuan. The reason why tax-exempt exports exceeded taxable exports is due to the government's incentives for exporting domestic goods. Taxable imports at Jianghai Customs: 9,499,000 gold units, tax-exempt imports: 81,000 gold units; Taxable exports: 27,739,000 yuan, tax-exempt exports: 65,032,000 yuan.

### Inspection at the Gap in North Jiangxi Road, Sometimes Strict, Sometimes Relaxed, Tightened the Day Before Yesterday, Eased Yesterday

Starting the day before yesterday, the Japanese sentries at the gap in the barbed wire fence on North Jiangxi Road suddenly tightened their inspection of residents entering and exiting the gap. Those carrying heavy objects were required to open them for inspection, and those carrying heavy loads on their shoulders were prohibited from passing through the post, so the situation became tense. Starting yesterday, the above-mentioned tense atmosphere has eased. However, the Japanese sentries require those entering and exiting the gap to show "passes," but they no longer interrogate them. Furthermore, they do not restrict the month and year on the "passes" as they do at Xin Kaihe.

### Second Batch of Fractional Currency Issued, Third Batch to be Issued Consecutively, 500,000 Yuan of Subsidiary Currency Arrives in Shanghai, Distributed to British Merchants and Already Circulating in the Market

The panic over the shortage of fractional currency, subsidiary currency, and one-yuan currency in Shanghai has been addressed after the Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the Joint Office of the Four Banks, instructing the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank to find ways to adjust the situation. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday: (1) Fractional currency: The second batch of 500,000 yuan has been issued, and the third batch has been printed by the American company Yong Ning and will be issued consecutively by the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank. The method of issuance will still adopt a gradual system and will decide whether to print a fourth batch based on market needs. (2) Subsidiary currency: The 500,000 yuan previously shipped to Shanghai by the British HSBC Bank is the new edition of the 26th year of the Republic of China currency printed by the Chinese Da Ye Company for the Chinese Farmers Bank. It has already been distributed by HSBC Bank to British companies such as Yi Zhong, Lun Chang, and Yihe for paying workers' wages, and it is already circulating in the market. It is reported that this subsidiary currency was requested directly from the Head Office of the Chinese Farmers Bank by HSBC Bank on behalf of various British merchants, and was approved and shipped to Shanghai by foreign ships, and has nothing to do with the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Farmers Bank. (3) One-yuan currency: After the new currency was shipped to the Central Bank and the Bank of China by the Central Bank and HSBC Bank, it has been widely circulated in the market.

### Excess Profits Tax to be Levied from New Year's Day, Tax Rates Have Been Lowered, Collected Annually According to Regulations

The excess profits tax is an excellent wartime tax system. After the regulations were revised, they were promulgated on July 6th, 1939, raising the starting standard for the excess profits tax on business operations to 20% and the starting standard for the excess profits tax on property rentals to 15%. The tax rates have also been lowered at various times. It was stipulated that the tax would be levied from January 1, 1940. Now, the Ministry of Finance has decided to start levying the tax from January 1, 1940, that is, to collect the excess profits tax for 1939, and to collect it annually according to the regulations. After the levy begins, it will be able to increase tax revenue and provide sufficient war funds. Its important significance lies in realizing the principle of "those with money contributing money" to save the country and balancing the burden on society.

### Orphanage to Hold New Building Inauguration Ceremony and Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition on New Year's Day

The Shanghai Relief of Refugee Children's Orphanage will hold a new building inauguration ceremony on New Year's Day. A preparatory meeting was held yesterday, and the following resolutions were made: (1) Print a special issue; (2) Send a letter to the members of the Shanghai Recreational and Entertainment Association to perform programs; (3) Announce the organizational outline of the Refugee Children's Disciplinary Corps; (4) Appoint the conference staff; (5) Send a letter to the film industry to film the lives of the orphanage children; (6) Approve the conference budget. In addition, more than a thousand pieces of calligraphy and painting that the orphanage had collected to raise construction funds are all valuable calligraphy and paintings from ancient and modern times. It is now heard that they will be publicly exhibited for five days starting on New Year's Day, and June 7th is the date for drawing lots and receiving items. Anyone with the orphanage's calligraphy and painting lottery tickets can draw lots and receive one piece of calligraphy and painting. It is reported that the exhibition will be held at the orphanage, and all are welcome to visit.

### Smooth Cargo Transportation in Eastern Zhejiang, Extended Inspection Time, Eight Hours Daily

Recently, since the port of Zhenhai in eastern Zhejiang has been smoothly navigable, cargo transportation has been frequent. After a foreign ship successfully made a trial voyage to the port of Wenzhou, there is also a large accumulation of goods shipped from Shanghai to Wenzhou. There are also many domestic goods waiting to be shipped. According to shipping industry sources, in order to quickly process inspections and ensure smooth cargo transportation, the Zhejiang Customs has extended the daily inspection time from seven hours to eight hours of work. The headquarters of each defense command has also dispatched personnel to handle cargo inspection and transportation in order to promptly inspect and release import and export goods.

### Zhanghuabang Shipyard Not Returned, Huangpu River Dredging Postponed Indefinitely

The Shanghai Dredging Bureau's dredging and surveying vessels, as well as transportation launches, total more than 30. Apart from a small number that have been returned by the Japanese, most have not been returned, and the Zhanghuabang Shipyard has not been handed over. Furthermore, the above-mentioned vessels all require a considerable amount of time for inspection and repair. Therefore, the resumption of dredging work is not certain. The bureau's dredging work outside the mouth of Wusong includes various parts of the Yangtze River estuary and Shentan. Although dredging has been suspended for a long time and silt has accumulated, the bureau's dredging department has decided to start dredging simultaneously when dredging work on the Huangpu River resumes. However, there are no preparations to continue dredging the Wusong River (i.e., Suzhou Creek), as this section of the project is not within the scope of the Huangpu River dredging. Whether or not to dredge it will be considered.

### Employment Agencies Increase Referral Fees

Prices in Shanghai continue to rise, and various industries have repeatedly announced price increases. It is now learned that the employment referral industry (i.e., employment agencies) in the city will also increase the commission charged for referring jobs, starting in January. This adds another burden to the working class. The industry's announcement is recorded below: "Since commodity prices have been rising rapidly, the responsibilities borne by our industry have also increased, and the cost of living is rising daily, and expenses are increasing. We have been bearing the pain until now, and although we want to make a difficult effort, we cannot do so. Therefore, we have convened a joint meeting of the industry in the city and resolved that, starting on January 1st of the new year, the original referral fees will be: (1) Aunts and elder sisters will be increased by 10%; (2) Wet nurses will be increased by 20%; Male workers will be increased by 20%, as a means of compensation. This is a forced measure, and we hope for understanding from all sectors."

### Domestic and International Airmail: Explanation of Delivery and Dispatch; Temporary Suspension of Airmail Printed Matter

Since the Shanghai departures of the China and Eurasia Aviation Companies' routes were suspended after the August 13th Shanghai Battle, airmail from Shanghai to Ningxia, Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou provinces, and areas west of these provinces, as well as Shashi and areas west of it in Hubei province, is centrally dispatched by the Shanghai Post Office to Hong Kong, where it is transferred to airplanes to continue its journey. Due to the large quantity of airmail printed matter, except for attachments to official documents, acceptance has been temporarily suspended. However, individual airmail parcels destined for the Southwest, containing urgently needed medicines, and weighing no more than one kilogram, have resumed acceptance. The acceptance point remains on the second floor of the General Post Office on North Sichuan Road (accessible from the North Jiangxi Road Bridge or Tianhou Palace Bridge).

### Large Fire in West Shanghai Yesterday Morning: Over Two Hundred Thatched Sheds Burned; Fire Also Reported on Yidingpan Road

Over two hundred households of thatched sheds were built opposite Huayuan Village on Bailinan Road, near the intersection of Kaixuan Road in West Shanghai. The residents are all working class. The day before yesterday, the weather was very cold. Gao Xueyou, a 41-year-old resident of the sheds, was using a coal stove for heating. Around 2:00 AM, a fire suddenly broke out due to carelessness. Because the structures were thatched sheds, they were highly flammable.

The fire spread rapidly, flames soaring and darting about uncontrollably. Residents were awakened from their sleep and scrambled to escape, carrying the elderly and children. Their cries of grief were heartbreaking. The Caojiadu Fire Brigade in West Shanghai and the Public Concession Fire Brigade responded and rushed to the scene. However, the fireground was vast and the fire spread in all directions.

Extinguishing the fire was difficult, and it was not until 4:20 AM that it was put out. All of the more than two hundred thatched sheds were reduced to ashes. Fortunately, no one was burned to death, but the residents are now without shelter, waiting outside the fireground for relief. With the biting north wind, their suffering is unimaginable. Furthermore, the Jin Yuan Confectionery, located at No. 20, Yangzi Village, Lane 95, Yidingpan Road, Bailinan Road, was opened by Shen Rengeng from Shaoxing. At 11:30 PM the previous night, a fire suddenly broke out in the company's baking room. The Caojiadu Fire Brigade arrived and extinguished the fire. A total of five houses were destroyed, including No. 25, the home of Fang Daozhou; No. 23, the home of Zhu Guiqing; No. 22, the home of Xiang Chongshan; and No. 21, the home of Gu Qingxiang.

Around 12:00 PM yesterday, the French Concession Police Department suddenly learned that a large group of robbers, divided into three cars and carrying weapons, were planning to operate within the concession. They also learned the robbers' route, which was sure to pass through Caishi Road. They immediately ordered a large number of detectives wearing steel helmets and body armor to be deployed at Taiping Bridge, Caishi Road, and along Malang Road, Lafayette Road, and other locations. As a result, one car was intercepted on Caishi Road, containing several criminals carrying weapons and ammunition. One criminal was arrested on Malang Road, Lafayette Road, and a Mauser pistol and more than ten bullets were confiscated. It was also reported that a robber was arrested on Avenue Dubail, and weapons were also confiscated.

A dispute arose between Mr. Maden (transliteration), manager of the British company Gibb, Livingston & Co., and Mr. Ye Chuanfang, manager of the Chinese Shipping Company No. 2, the Bund, French Concession, regarding the sale of the vessel "Brain," leading to a breach of contract. Mr. Maden, represented by a lawyer, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court against Ye Chuanfang, demanding the delivery of the vessel "Brain" against payment of 20,000 pounds sterling, plus damages of 1,360 pounds sterling per day from October 31st of this year until the date of delivery. If the defendant failed to deliver the ship, the plaintiff further demanded compensation of 10,000 pounds sterling in addition to the aforementioned damages, and requested permission for provisional execution. The defendant, Ye Chuanfang, was represented by lawyer Jiang Yiping. After several court hearings presided over by Judge Yu Changzi, the debate was declared closed and a date was set for the judgment. All of this has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date of judgment. At 9:00 AM, Judge Li Liang, acting on behalf of Civil Court No. 7, announced the judgment: the plaintiff's claims and the request for provisional execution were dismissed.

### Assassination Attempt on Yidingpan Road Yesterday Afternoon: Assailants Used Axes to Attack; Victim Named Guo Baojin

Around 11:20 AM yesterday, an assassination attempt occurred near the intersection of Bailinan Road and Yidingpan Road in West Shanghai. The victim, Guo Baojin, 36 years old, was passing through the area when he was suddenly attacked by four assailants wielding two axes. Without warning, they hacked at both of his shoulders, inflicting about a dozen blows. Seeing that their objective had been achieved, the attackers fled in all directions. Guo collapsed to the ground, bleeding profusely and barely breathing. The Jing'an Temple police station, after being notified, immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene, but the assailants had already escaped. They immediately summoned an ambulance and sent Guo to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. His injuries are serious.

### Three Convicted of Forcing a Woman into Prostitution

Ni Wang, a woman from Tongzhou residing at No. 742, Maolin Fang, Xiaoshadu Road, had a 16-year-old daughter named Meiying. On September 7th, around 3:00 PM, Jiang Qian, an old woman from Shaoxing residing at No. 361, Haining Road, and Cai Xuzhou, Ni Wang's lover, under the pretext of introducing Meiying to work at a yarn factory in Yangshupu, colluded with Chen Liu, an old woman from Anhui, and sold Meiying to Wang Laosi, a procuress at No. 19, Rue Tenant de St. Paul in the French Concession, for 220 yuan to work as a prostitute. After the crime, Ni Wang reported to the Gordon Road police station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to arrest Jiang Qian, Chen Liu, Cai Xuzhou, and the suspect Chen Aliang from Ningbo and transferred them to the First Special District Court. Ni Meiying and Wang Laosi, the procuress, could not be found. After interrogation, they waited for the announcement of the verdict. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the court and sentenced Cai Xuzhou to four years of imprisonment and Jiang Qian and Chen Liu to one year and six months each, as a warning. Chen Aliang was found not guilty and released immediately.

### Renji Hospital Report

Overall, the figures above show a slight decrease in the hospital's workload, which is a typical phenomenon in winter. However, the number of male suicides still exceeds more than half the number from last month, which is deeply regrettable. The Music Committee of the American Community Church held a concert on November 30th, donating two-thirds of all proceeds to the hospital. The church's righteous act is inspiring for the hospital's work. The concert was a success, and the audience praised it endlessly.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor, On Friday morning, after the deadline for responding to our requests submitted to the company authorities had passed (originally limited to two days for a reply, but it was already the fourth day) without any news, we, the factory workers, immediately elected representative Mr. He Junyue to meet with the factory manager. With no results, we then implemented a slowdown. The company then requested the police station to send police to the factory to drive out the workers and used White Russian workers, using high-pressure tactics, resulting in a conflict. At the time, we were all unarmed, and it was difficult to resist, resulting in several workers suffering injuries of varying degrees. Representative He Junyue was also arrested. When the news reached the Shanghai head office and the wharves in Pudong, all employees were indignant and also implemented a slowdown in response. Around 2:00 PM, Mr. Gu Bingyuan of the Industry Section of the Public Works Bureau intervened to mediate, releasing the arrested representative and persuading the workers to return to work. The demands made will be discussed further after the company director returns to Shanghai from Japan. As a result, the employees at the head office and the two wharves in Pudong resumed work one after another, and all workers at this factory also resumed work today. This is the factual account of the events, and there was no involvement from the Fuyi Society or Japanese military police. This matter concerns the reputation of all employees, so we have specifically clarified the truth in order to distinguish right from wrong. Please publish this in your newspaper's Letter to the Editor column. Sincerely, All Workers of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, Yangshupu. December 24th.

### The Only Weapon to Control the War: British Coal Exports on the Rise (Part 1) German Coal Unable to Communicate Transport Outlets; American Coal Subsidized for Export to South America

— Quan

Since the European war began, Germany's victory over Poland has created an excellent opportunity to restore the British Empire's coal export trade. In the past, British coal exports could not compete with those of Poland and Germany. According to coal exporters, based on economic news reports, the disappearance of German ships at sea is Britain's opportunity. Only the Baltic Sea route is still open. Germany's domestic needs are great, and land transportation is very difficult, so Germany's coal exports are bound to be greatly affected.

Neutral countries currently harbor excessive expectations for coal, as coal is a wartime weapon. As a result, British coal exports are presented with an opportunity. Britain has jumped to become the central seller to various countries. At the same time, Britain especially hopes to gain a foothold in South American countries with its wartime coal products to satisfy the desire of those in need. This is Britain's recent export trade policy. The sudden outbreak of World War II caused the Allied forces of Britain and France to come to blows with Germany. Both sides consumed huge amounts of coal in the war. German coal exports fell from 18,313,000 tons in 1932 to the current 29,640,000 tons. Among those dependent on Germany, France and Italy were the largest. In recent years, 1937 saw 8,000,000 tons, double the 4,000,000 tons in 1932. Sales to Italy in 1937 were 7,930,000 tons, more than five times the 1,440,000 tons in 1932, an even greater increase. German coal sales in other smaller markets were most significant in Canada and the countries of the South American Federation, which cannot be ignored. From 1932 to last year, German coal sales to Canada accounted for 388,000 tons, and exports to the South American Federation totaled 963,000 tons. Polish coal export trade has gradually grown in recent years, and coal production has become spectacular. In 1938, Polish coal exports totaled 11,687,000, nearly half of which flowed to the Scandinavian countries and France and Italy, which were formerly British coal markets. Polish coal exports to France and Italy were the highest in 1932 and 1938. At this time, Britain could not match and fell behind. In the past seven years, due to the increase in ship freight, the export volume of Germany and Poland has invisibly increased by nearly 9 million tons, while British coal has fallen by 5.5 million tons.

1938 was the worst year for German coal export trade. The coal imported into France from Germany and Poland was only 7 million tons. The main reason for the decline was British coal gaining ground. The growing Polish coal market was also almost swept away by British coal. Polish coal exports — outside the scope of trade treaties — have been steadily increasing in recent years. In 1934, production reached 436,000 tons (or 2.5% of total European coal), while in 1938, Polish coal exports had climbed to 1,839,000 tons (or 11.4% of total European coal). In the same year, British coal fell to 3 million tons. Recently, British coal has closely followed the footsteps of German and Polish and invaded French coal trade. What we know is that British coal is making extensive progress and driving German and Polish coal out.

The situation for coal in Italy is very simple. In recent years, the production of coal in the Ruhr and Silesian regions of Italy has been high. It was shipped by ship to areas south of Switzerland. Since the outbreak of World War II, Italy has stopped shipping and is in a state of stagnation. The reasons for the stagnation are (1) Switzerland does not allow the supply of railways as a thoroughfare, (2) There are no German freight cars available for transportation, and (3) Germany itself has enough coal in storage to meet its own needs. Due to the difficulty of transportation in Poland, although Germany occupies half of Poland, it has not been able to mine Polish coal to this day. Another reason is that Germany wants to do its best to prevent coal exports and maintain its original raw materials for its own supply. The only exports are to exchange for its necessities. Trade negotiations between Britain and Italy are currently underway. Coal from South Wales in Britain hopes to be sold to Italy in large quantities, with the aim of signing a reciprocal treaty. The negotiations between the two parties are progressing smoothly.

At the same time, according to reports, Spain did not need foreign coal in the past, but since the civil war, Spain has been urgently seeking foreign coal supplies. Therefore, Britain is also a great opportunity for dumping.

As for the coal market in the Baltic Sea countries, it is quite bleak and fragile. After the outbreak of the war, Germany has no scruples about the Anglo-French front. Germany controls the Baltic Sea and has an absolute advantage. Since the outbreak of the war, they can contribute as much coal, iron, food and wartime military supplies to Germany as possible. Moreover, since Poland and Germany are connected, Germany is even more complacent. (To be continued)

### Temperatures Drop Below Freezing Again: Frozen Corpses of Beggars Everywhere; Total Reaches 51 Large and Small in Two Days

The weather in this city has recently become severely cold again, causing beggars who sleep on the streets to freeze to death everywhere, a tragic situation. According to the Datong News Agency's inquiry with the observatory, due to the cold wave of high pressure in this city, the temperature every morning from 5 to 6 AM has fallen below 0 degrees Celsius. The biting north wind is blowing and the weather is extremely cold, making it difficult for refugees and beggars to survive the severe winter. In the past two days, dozens of beggars have frozen to death. According to the Pushan Villa, the number of beggar corpses collected on the 24th was 18 large and 6 small. On the 25th, another 23 large and 4 small were collected. In the two days, there were a total of 51 corpses. The most frequently discovered locations are in the central district, especially along Shilu, Wuhu Road, and Shanxi Road. Secondly, the Jing'an Temple Road and Da Xi Road areas in the west district are also quite frequently discovered, causing the collection vehicles to travel back and forth frequently, making the work extremely busy.

### Grain: Dumi Still Lacking in Arrivals; Japonica and Indica Sold at 40 Yuan; Price Limits Ineffectively Again; Foreign Rice Market Prices Rise in Japan

Since the rice market was closed for one day in commemoration of the Yunnan Uprising of the Previous Dynasty, yesterday, general stores purchased a lot more. In the early market, the inland sources were still not much, and peddlers also sought to sell, so the transaction was very prosperous for a while. Foreign rice was still the majority, and japonica and indica rice were only ornaments. During this period of brisk sales, the market gradually increased. However, because there were plenty of chips on the market, although Saigon rice opened at 38 yuan and was gradually called to 38.5 yuan, it was difficult to do so. The closing price was still 38 yuan, only 2 or 3 cents higher than before. Broken rice initially opened at 33.3 yuan, then 33.5 yuan, an increase of 3 to 5 cents before and after. Romanian rice closed at 38.5 yuan. Tokyo polished rice was particularly special at 35.5 yuan, then 34.5 yuan. The market situation was similar to that of Qugong rice. As for the thick and thin japonica rice opened, the thick japonica was only Sutong goods. If Tongli and Lisheng japonica rice were all limited to 40 yuan. Qingsi high thin also opened at 40 yuan. Fengjia and other early and late rice opened high at 40 yuan, and the middle section was 39.5 yuan. Lu Jianzhen was particularly special at 40 yuan, with middle and second grades priced separately. Yang Jian was 39.5 yuan, 39 yuan. However, because Tokyo polished rice had reached 34.5 yuan, if the passenger tips were sold at the limited price of 33 yuan, it would indeed be a loss of 3 or 4 yuan. Therefore, general goods owners modestly sold them, resulting in no transactions. There are many ways to change the yuan, but there are not many goods on the market, so the market is particularly brisk. It is estimated that no less than 7 or 8 thousand bags were traded in the city. There are no hoarders on the market, and all are normal transactions, so although people's hearts are good, the market only fluctuates by 3 or 5 cents. However, if the inland sources continue in this way and are cut off for a long time, relying only on some foreign rice will delay the future of Shanghai rice. Therefore, it is urgent to negotiate and restore the source.

A few hundred bags of Jiangbei indica rice arrived at the port yesterday. However, because the cost of Jiangbei indica rice was more than 35 yuan, there were calls for 36 yuan. It is said that dark market transactions have been completed many times, and they have been reported and warned. However, low-grade indica rice in the market still sells at the limited price of 33 yuan, but most of them hoard and refuse to sell.

Yesterday, more than 10,000 bags of foreign rice were loaded on the Taikoo Chongqing ship, and there were also many scattered tickets transferred from Hong Kong. However, after the shop made the country guest's stomach prosperous, the prices of various rice increased step by step. Saigon and Weigao grades all reached 38.5 yuan, and high broken rice also reached 34 yuan. The original package spot price rose to 46.4 yuan, which is 5 or 6 cents higher than the spot price last week, and the original package rose by nearly 1 yuan. Foreign rice has been opening higher and higher every day, so the authorities are also planning to limit prices.

### Flour and Wheat Market Quiet

Yesterday's flour market saw no significant fluctuations. Second-grade flour remained at eight yuan and seventy cents. Demand from buyers was also very subdued, with only over twenty thousand packages changing hands. There was little activity in terms of goods returning to or leaving storage. It is said that the Japanese-made Phoenix brand flour for this month is nearing its end-of-month expiration, leading to some pressure on short sellers. The price opened at eight yuan, one dime, and three cents. The January situation remains steady.

The supply of wheat saw a slight improvement yesterday. Several thousand packages arrived over the past few days, mostly stored in warehouses awaiting higher prices. Mills are not eager to buy raw materials, nor are commodity brokers. However, sellers are holding firm. It is said that mills are asking for up to fifteen yuan for two to three thousand packages, with slight variations for medium quality. The market is stagnant.

### Soybean Speculation Revives

Given that oil prices have not suffered excessive declines, soybean speculation has generally become more active. Although market prices have not seen drastic changes, the underlying strength is evident due to limited supply, making the price base quite firm. Yesterday, statistics showed over two hundred packages of Jiangbei beans trading at sixteen yuan, over one thousand packages of Dingjia Zhou beans trading from seventeen yuan and fifty cents to eighteen yuan, seven or eight truckloads of Nanjing beans trading from sixteen yuan to seventeen yuan and one dime, and five to six hundred packages of Wuhu beans trading from seventeen yuan and fifty cents to eighteen yuan. Exports remain stagnant, with speculation accounting for three-quarters of the demand, followed by local street trade.

### Securities: Domestic Debt Stable

The over-the-counter securities market was quiet yesterday. As the two-day market closure ended, hopes for peace remained strong, boosting confidence. However, with foreign exchange and gold still suspended, morale was low, leading to very light trading. On the official exchange, activity was minimal due to a lack of customer interest, resulting in only minor price fluctuations. Some financial institutions sold off their holdings, suppressing potential gains and keeping prices flat. In the morning, Xie Da saw strong selling, and Lian Yi San Kai also saw some offloading. Hong Kang, Ding Kang, Shun Tai, and retail investors bought in, slightly strengthening prices. In the afternoon, Hong Da and Mao Tai showed some demand, but in small quantities, leaving the market flat. Ultimately, all categories except Ding experienced a two-cent increase, while Yi remained unchanged. Total trading volume amounted to just over thirty thousand yuan. A summary is provided below.

Stock trading saw thirty shares of the Commercial Press stock change hands at sixty-eight yuan per share.

### Textiles: Nanyang Cotton Goods Sought in Shanghai

Domestic Cloth: Sales of Nanyang cotton cloth were brisk yesterday. Demand from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Tianjin merchants also increased. Local traders and speculators were actively seeking supplies, pushing prices higher. Fine cloth and fine twill increased by ten to twenty cents per bolt, while bleached and printed cloth increased by one dime to five dimes. The British firms Jardine Matheson and Wheelock Marden had the best sales. Coarse cloth and bleached cloth continued to rise by twenty-five to fifty cents. Over ten thousand bolts of Hong Yang Biao bleached cloth were procured for Siam, Singapore, and other overseas locations. Zhejiang and Jiangxi merchants purchased over one hundred pieces of bleached cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. Tianjin merchants purchased nearly one hundred pieces of twill poplin. Local street trading involved over six hundred pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, bleached cloth, and twill.

Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, the market was closed due to foreign firms observing a holiday. However, due to Tianjin merchants procuring over five hundred pieces of mid- to low-grade fine cloth, the market was buoyant, and asking prices were quite high. The selling price of fine cloth increased by fifty to sixty cents per bolt compared to last week, and fine twill increased by thirty to forty cents. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth saw increasing local trading, closing at twenty-two yuan and one dime in the evening, with a very firm trend.

### Yarn and Cotton: Post-Holiday Yarn and Cotton Remain Strong, Prices Firm

The yarn market is increasingly stable, with a positive trend, but actual sales remain sluggish. However, general market sentiment is that mills cannot profit due to production costs, so those with ample capital are not bearish on yarn prices, buying in several hundred packages. Although spot yarn business is quiet, confidence remains high, and prices are rising. Overall, the underlying fundamentals are strong, but actual demand remains weak, which will limit significant price increases.

Spot yarn opened this morning with foreign cotton and exchange rates still suspended due to the holiday. Market sentiment was peaceful, with traders generally bullish. Twenty-count Double Horse opened at seven hundred and thirty-five yuan, similar to the afternoon price from the previous day. After some long positions were closed, it fell slightly by two yuan. However, a speculator, anticipating a higher market opening, suddenly bought one to two hundred packages, tightening the market to seven hundred and thirty-six yuan at closing. Statistics for half-day trading showed twenty-count Double Horse up four yuan, Tian Nv up one yuan, and Double Earth up two yuan. Yong An Factory offered thirty-two count, fifteen packages of special Jin Cheng at nine hundred and thirty-five yuan. The quantities purchased by various merchant groups are listed below: Local Traders: 1,630; Mainland: 190; Hong Kong: 130; Total: 1,950.

Cotton trading remains quiet. Mills are only packing and not buying. Trading among merchants is also less active than before, as everyone prepares to close out business during this Lunar New Year period, and business activity is somewhat relaxed. However, prices remain up by one to two yuan. Supplies from northern Jiangsu continue to arrive. During these days of market closure, a total of nine thousand eight hundred and seventy-one packages of Tonghua cotton arrived, and two thousand one hundred and eighty-one packages of Changyinsha cotton. The spot cotton situation is listed below: Bei Tai Hua: 164.00; Traded 30 packages among merchants. Huo Ji Cao: 157.00; Another 145 packages; Another 160.00; Another 420 packages. Tongzhou Hua: 170.00; Another 100 packages; Another 168.00; Tongcheng bought 300 packages.

### Finance: Gold Market Slightly Weak, Jewelry Gold Unchanged

The over-the-counter spot gold market saw no trading yesterday due to the Christmas holiday market closure. Normal trading will resume today. Over-the-counter trading did occur, with a generally stable trend. A money exchange dealer offered four thousand one hundred and forty-five yuan, but the market weakened due to rumors of Sino-Japanese peace. Securities brokers sold off a hundred and several tens of taels on behalf of multiple clients, causing the price to gradually decrease from four thousand one hundred and forty-five yuan to four thousand one hundred and thirty yuan. Jewelry stores absorbed most of the supply. In the late afternoon, there were still sellers at four thousand one hundred and thirty-two or thirty-three yuan, down about three to four yuan from the closing price last weekend.

The exchange rate for gold jewelry remained unchanged throughout the day. Da Tong Hang still quoted four hundred and twenty yuan per tael, and Xin Tong Hang quoted the same price, with a fifteen-yuan reduction for purchases.

### Discount Rate Unchanged

The discount rate for bills of exchange remained between thirty-eight and thirty-nine yuan per thousand yesterday, ultimately settling at thirty-eight yuan and fifty cents, the same as last Saturday. The Shanghai Money Dealers Association's interbank lending rate remained unchanged at 1.5 cents in both the morning and afternoon sessions.

### Sugar Market: Brown Sugar Down Five Cents

Yesterday's sugar market was flat, with little fluctuation. The Shanghai Sugar Merchant Association's benchmark price for spot raw white sugar was fifty-eight yuan and fifty cents for warehouse goods, fifty-eight yuan and fifty to thirty cents for newly arrived goods in outside warehouses, fifty-eight yuan for old goods, and forty-eight yuan for transshipment goods. Taikoo granulated white sugar B Mark was fifty-eight yuan for East Warehouse and fifty-eight yuan and fifty cents for West Warehouse. CW Mark was fifty-eight yuan and two dimes, CX Mark was fifty-seven yuan and seven dimes, DY Mark was fifty-six yuan and five dimes for East Warehouse and fifty-six yuan for West Warehouse, and HX Mark was fifty-six yuan for West Warehouse. H Mark raw red sugar was forty-four yuan and five dimes, and Dutch red sugar was forty-six yuan to forty-five yuan and five dimes, all down by five cents. The prices for local Number One white sugar and Number One rock sugar remained unchanged. Chaozhou merchants offered several tens of packages of high-quality rock sugar at fifty-six yuan and five dimes and over fifty packages of Qibai sugar at fifty yuan.

### Dried and Preserved Goods: Quanzhou Dried Longan Supply to be Disrupted

According to a telegram from suppliers of Quanzhou dried longan, stocks are dwindling, and purchase prices have increased by five yuan. Furthermore, transportation is being obstructed by certain parties, threatening to disrupt the supply. Therefore, local merchants will likely raise prices for the goods they already have in stock, starting today or tomorrow.

### Coal: Abundant Hai Feng Coal Supply

The supply of Hai Feng white coal has suddenly become abundant recently. Over nine hundred tons arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Dealers and speculators have ample stock, leading floating traders to sell off. Over-the-counter prices are somewhat weak. Hai Feng lump coal is priced at one hundred and twenty yuan per ton. Speculators' warehouse receipts are discounted by two to three yuan. Local shops are selling screened lump coal at one hundred and twenty-eight yuan, or six yuan and four dimes per dan.

### Statistics: Price Changes

—

October and November

The pace of price increases in Shanghai during October and November was significantly slower compared to September. This is because the previous price increases were excessive, and further increases would undoubtedly lead to consumer abandonment. Therefore, the price increases during these two months were less pronounced than in the previous month. The following is an analysis of the price increases during October and November:

There were a total of sixty-six price increases in October, meaning sixty-six businesses increased their prices. This is a decrease of seventy-one from the one hundred and thirty-seven increases in September. These sixty-six price increases can be categorized into thirteen groups: food and beverages, daily necessities, clothing, medicine, candles and foil, electricity, decoration, culture and printing, cosmetics, travel, civil engineering, specialty items, and packaging. Daily necessities accounted for the most increases, with fourteen, ranking first. Medicine was second with nine increases. Food and beverages and travel were third with eight increases each. Clothing and metal and electricity were fourth with six increases each. Culture and printing and civil engineering were fifth with four increases each. Candles and foil and specialty items were sixth with two increases each. Cosmetics, packaging, and decoration were at the bottom with one increase each. (To be continued)

### Overview of This Year's Unified University Entrance Examination (50)

(3) The Need for Academic Guidance: The concentration of student preferences in the unified examination reveals that, on one hand, it reflects the needs of the times and the country. On the other hand, it clearly lacks guidance for academic pursuits. Choosing good schools is naturally a common desire among students, but the selection of departments often does not align with their academic abilities and interests. The results of last year's unified examination showed a particularly large number of students applying to engineering departments, leading to high acceptance rates. However, due to poor academic interest and performance, many students requested transfers to other departments or faculties after one year. This year's situation is generally similar. Among many unaccepted students, we found that their academic performance did not match their desired departments. For example, some students scored zero in mathematics and had poor scores in physics and chemistry, yet their three choices were all engineering. Some had English scores below five, yet they applied to foreign language departments. Some had zero in chemistry, yet they applied to the chemistry department. Some had very poor geography and history scores, yet they applied to the history department. How can someone with zero in mathematics and poor physics and chemistry scores study engineering? How can someone with poor English study foreign languages? How can someone with zero in chemistry study chemistry? These students clearly did not assess their own abilities before applying and randomly filled out their choices. Some students even chose schools and departments that do not exist at the schools they applied to. They did not even understand whether their desired departments existed at the schools, let alone distinguish the merits of different departments. This shows that academic guidance for secondary school students is indeed necessary. In the future, secondary schools should conduct more individual investigations and provide detailed guidance on students' personalities, interests, academic abilities, and aspirations. Universities and educational administrative bodies should also pay attention to this issue and compile specialized books introducing university programs so that prospective students are not at a loss. Choosing unwisely, having incompatible interests, or lacking sufficient academic ability can lead to confusion and even misdirection for students and a significant loss for the country.

(4) Improvements in Examination Administration: Judging from the results of the unified examinations over the past two years, the administration and examination methods can be considered relatively rigorous and satisfactory. However, there are still many areas that need improvement. First is the issue of grading. This year's examination questions were unified, and the Ministry of Education made great efforts in sending questions and invigilators. It can be said that the establishment of the unified examination system is based on the unification of examination questions. However, although the questions are unified, the grading cannot be unified. Therefore, the leniency of grading and the adjustment of scores must still be adopted. Centralized grading, as I mentioned in the second section, is difficult to achieve due to various practical difficulties, and the method of regional grading must be adopted. Grading is the most important aspect of the examination. The selection of graders must be cautious, and the guidelines for questions and grading standards must be carefully stipulated. According to the current method, the question-setting committee drafts the grading standards for each question, and the graders grade each question separately and assign scores. This method is good, but the standards can be further refined. Ideally, the question-setting committee should create a set of model answers that specify the full score for answering the entire question correctly, a certain score for the correct theory but incorrect method, and a certain score for a partially correct method or answering a specific aspect of the question. The various possible answers for each question can be analyzed in detail, and the sum of the scores for each part of a question is the total score for that question, and the sum of the scores for each question is the total score for the subject. However, the unified examination is not a standardized test. It is impossible to achieve the objectivity of a standardized test, but the more detailed the analysis, the more objective the results can be. Second is the issue of preferences and allocation. According to the unified examination method, candidates can apply for three preferences. Those who choose departments in Group Two as their first preference can choose departments in Group Three as their other preferences. Those who apply to Groups One and Three cannot choose departments in Group Two as their preferences. The reason is that the mathematics examination for Group Two is more advanced, and physics and chemistry are required subjects, so taking Group Three is not a problem. They only need to take an additional examination in biology or foreign history and geography.

### Nanjiao Academy Sets New Year's Day for New Building Inauguration

The Shanghai Relief and Education Center for Refugee Children has been established for over a year. The center has built twenty-eight new buildings at 99, Alley 258, Wuding Road since September this year. After moving into the new location for education and care, the number of refugees has increased to five hundred and seventeen. With the diligent planning of the center's Chairman Yuan Ludeng, Director Lu Wentao, General Secretary Yuan Mingjun, and Deputy General Secretary Yu Jingqing, the center's operations have gradually developed, resulting in remarkable achievements. The center is scheduled to hold the inauguration ceremony of the new buildings on New Year's Day and will publicly exhibit thousands of collected paintings and calligraphy works for five days. Anyone holding a painting and calligraphy gift certificate can draw lots to claim the item.

### Education Briefs

Yesterday was the anniversary celebration of Zhizhong Girls' High School. A dinner was held at the YMCA, attended by over one hundred teachers, students, and alumni. Principal Chen Naiwen reported on the school's development. School board members Jiang Zhuzhuang and Shan Meishu gave speeches. It is reported that the school is scheduled to hold entrance examinations for new students on January 25.

Huaguang Amateur Night Middle School has been reorganized into a drama college, with the appointment of department heads. It will be established from the next semester. The YMCA's Boys' Department is training children leaders to promote moral, intellectual, physical, and social education.

The examination of teachers for the Poor Children's Education Relief Center has been completed and will be announced in January. The Lian Girls' Department and affiliated primary school of Jianshu Middle School held their fourth anniversary celebration on the morning of the day before yesterday.

Failure Analysis

The Hu Lian team's crushing defeat yesterday, although attributed to unfamiliar playing conditions, was not accidental. The strength of the West United team is widely recognized. Veteran Cos Tay anchored the center, displaying impressive command. Harrison and Kaimo, as the two defenders, acted as impenetrable gates. Although Robasstof was absent, Fun's inclusion still made the team very active. The blonde Frazer ran across the entire field. However, Hu Lian might have had a chance if they had prepared to meet the challenge. Unfortunately, their key defender Li Yichen was injured in the match against the Russian team and could not participate. Sun Jinshun replaced Li in that position. Sun was not accustomed to the position, and Huang Kehou was also relatively weak. As a result, the ball constantly came from that direction. With such a defense, the attack was also weaker. The five forwards must have a leader to command the army and direct the battle. The three commanders, Dai Linjing, Sun Jinshun, and Li Yichen, were either sick, injured, or repositioned. Although A Kui was good, he was not a commander. Furthermore, A Kui was injured and left the field early in the game. With this lineup, how could they not be defeated? However, the severity of the defeat was unexpected by the twenty thousand spectators. Ambassador Cole kicked off the game (photo by Zhang Hong).

A Tragic Start

Hu Lian attacking towards the sun was already a disadvantage, and it was one of the main reasons for conceding two goals within the first two minutes of the game. British Ambassador Sir Cole kicked the ball towards the West United side, where Cos Tay received it. He passed it to Thompson, who attacked along the sideline and reached the penalty area, where Zhuang Youren blocked the ball. Huang Kehou committed a foul near the center line. Kaimo took the free kick, shooting the ball straight from thirty yards. Fun jumped up and headed the ball, but Bi Gao was blinded by the sun and failed to catch it. The ball bounced and went into the goal. This happened only one minute into the game. After the kickoff at the center line, Fun dribbled and shot at the goal. Zhuang Youren dived to block the ball, but Bi Gao repeated his mistake, and the ball went straight into the net. Within two minutes, Hu Lian conceded two goals, shocking the audience. After fifteen minutes, Youliang received a pass from Qi Xiang, dribbled into the center, and Wen Kui headed the ball, but was knocked unconscious and carried off the field. Hu Lian was then forced to play with ten men, making the situation even more unfavorable.

Four Consecutive Goals

The Hu Lian team launched a counterattack. Yi Liang passed to Qiu Ting, who shot, but the ball hit Kaimo and bounced back into the Hu Lian side. After twenty-eight minutes, Parr broke past Sun Jinshun, who fell to the ground. Fun shot powerfully from twenty yards and scored, making it three to zero. Five minutes later, Wen Kui勉强 returned to the field, but did not regain his normal form. Hu Lian substituted Xu Chongru in and regained some momentum. Wen Kui passed to Qi Xiang, who passed the ball to the right. Youliang hooked a shot, but Willie blocked it. Youliang was determined and crossed the ball in front of the goal. Wen Kui headed the ball again, but Willie was already out and about to block. Everyone thought it was a sure goal, but the ball hit the crossbar and bounced down. Dou Wen trapped the ball and shot again, but it was also futile. Two and a half minutes before the end of the first half, Youren saved the ball, resulting in a corner kick. Thompson crossed the ball, and it bounced off the post and into the goal. West United led by four goals.

A Futile Struggle

As the second half began, Hu Lian continued with ten men as Xu Wen Kui was too injured to play. At the same time, Qiu Ting and Dou Wen switched positions. West United kicked off and attacked again. The ball was won by the Hu Lian side. Qiu Ting passed to Dou Wen, who shot powerfully, but failed to break through Willie's defense. The Hu Lian team struggled hard. After eight minutes, Dou Wen lived up to expectations, receiving a cross from Youliang and shooting low from twenty-five yards, scoring a clear and beautiful goal. There was thunderous applause, redeeming one goal. Shortly after, Parr crossed the ball, and Yi Liang blocked it, resulting in a corner kick. Parr took the kick, and Jinshun failed to block the ball. The ball hit the goalpost but did not move. Fortunately, Bi Gao picked it up and kicked it out. After fifteen minutes, Jem took a free kick, MacLard headed the ball to Parr, and MacFunn connected with a shot, but Bi Gao blocked all the attempts. Finally, Fun scored, making it five to two. Subsequently, Youliang, with the assistance of Qi Xiang, spun around and unleashed a powerful shot. The ball flew like an arrow, but Willie caught it and shook, but did not slip. After nineteen minutes, he built another attack, adding to the half dozen. Five minutes later, Youliang secretly passed the ball, Qiu Ting threaded a pass, and Dou Wen shot powerfully. Willie caught the ball but dropped it again. Youliang rushed in and broke the net, sealing the six-to-two victory.

### West United Wins Big 6-2: Hua Lian Suffers Unprecedented Defeat, Disappointing 20,000 Fans, The Absence of Key Players Proves Fatal

The highly anticipated Christmas charity Mailing Engineer Cup game between Hua Lian and West United took place at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon. The Chinese and Western elites gathered for a game. Fans, remembering the excitement of the last charity match, rushed to the venue yesterday, packing the north and south stands of Yiyuan, creating a sea of people. It was a scene rarely seen since the Sixth National Games, with an estimated attendance of over 20,000 people, generating revenue of around 15,000 to 16,000 yuan. Unfortunately, the Hu Lian team had bad luck yesterday, suffering an unprecedented defeat of 2-6. Conceding four goals in the first half proved fatal. Although they fought hard in the second half, scoring two goals each, it was not enough, and they ultimately suffered a crushing defeat, disappointing the 20,000 fans. British Ambassador Sir Cole personally attended the game to kick off and present the awards after the match. The shiny silver cup was retained by the West United team. The lineups for both teams yesterday were as follows: West United: Harrison, Willie, Walter, Kaimo, Pengai, Cos Tay, Fu, Jem, Walter Thompson, Fraser, Fun, MacLard, Parr. Hu Lian: Sun Jinshun, Qin Bi Gao, Zhuang Youren, Huang Kehou, Meng Yi Liang, Jiang Zhaoxiang, Luo Dou Wen, Cao Qiuting, Xu Wen Kui, Wu Qixiang, Jia Youliang.

Spring and Autumn

### A Comfort to "New Postal Workers"

— Qiang Gong

It is said that working in the post office, customs, and bank are three "gilded rice bowls." The new postal workers and other new workers who passed the postal service examination this time, in addition to feeling "happy and excited," are indeed considered, in the face of the continuously increasing unemployment and the waves of life impacting and even forcing living beings into hardship in Shanghai, as a fortunate encounter that cannot but be recognized as a cause for celebration.

In their appeals, the new postal workers have raised the issue of the unequal treatment between "those selected to work in the post office" and "those assigned to the post office." This is indeed a problem that those who rely on salaries for a living in this time and place must argue for based on reason.

However, both the Post Office and the Savings and Remittance Bureau are directly under the Postal Administration Bureau, and the Postal Administration Bureau is a directly subordinate organ of the Ministry of Transportation. Therefore, its administration and the selection of personnel are naturally governed by special regulations, so there should be no unwarranted changes that would lead to preferential treatment and discrimination against new postal workers. If promotions and salary levels are based on the rules of selection and in accordance with the legal procedures, then not only should the new postal workers abide by them, but the old postal workers should also strive to comply.

Generally speaking, working under a government-administered agency—especially in a post office, which has a reputation for rigorous evaluation and fair selection—a new employee need not have any doubts. Moreover, the original letter stated that "the postal authorities claim that there is no discrimination and that everyone is serving the country..." This should further encourage the new postal workers to serve with loyalty and dedication! Even if the authorities temporarily act in a way that seems unfair, it should not be to target individuals or "young friends." This is something that can be reassured.

The problem lies in whether to be sent to work in the interior. Most people prefer to work in Shanghai. Hearing about being sent to the interior makes them turn pale. Some are indeed due to the high expectations of their parents; others are due to their wives and children being afraid of the hardships of long-distance travel. However, the statement that "ordinary meals cost sixty to seventy yuan per month, plus twenty to thirty yuan per month for rent" is somewhat exaggerated. Even if it exists, it is not the case everywhere in the interior.

In reality, going to the interior is good, the interior is better than Shanghai. Although the cost of living in the interior is higher, many local specialties are not that high. Ordinary people are still surviving, so why can't people from urban areas live in the interior? Moreover, the postal authorities will certainly not disregard the "hardships" of those who work in the interior. Therefore, it is hoped that the new postal workers will wait for the bureau to assign them. Why appeal?

### Mr. Huang Pintang, a Colleague at This Newspaper

— Shen Fugen

Just moments before his illness, his demeanor was peaceful and relaxed. He was still eloquently discussing the domestic and international situations with me. We had been acquainted for over a decade. Amidst the changing times, one realizes that people are only destined to come and go.

### The Poor Alleys of the Metropolis

— Shui Mo

(I) "White Powder Offender"

Another "white powder" offender has died! The residents of the alley are used to seeing this. There is no sigh, no frown; every day, one or several corpses of vagrants addicted to white powder lie there, with sallow faces and bodies as thin as firewood… until the blue car carries the corpse away.

There is no need to ask about the source of the death. His background is enough to prove it. It is always the same encounter: the deceased had no job, usually curled up to sleep in the alley at night, and one day he fell ill. He could not beg, nor could he steal, so he could not get the "white powder" that was the source of his life. He could endure hunger, but he could not go a day without it. When the addiction kicked in, he struggled and convulsed once, and his life ended.

(II) Sunlight

Sunlight is scarce in the poor alleys.

These old, dilapidated buildings can still be considered apartments. Gray houses, narrow paths paved with cobblestones; the wooden frames supporting the houses are withered and rotten, the whitewash on the walls peeling off in heaps, the outlines of the houses noticeably tilted, looking old and about to collapse. The landlord does not repair it. The lives of the residents in the alley are as cheap as ants.

Inside a house, a room is divided into several small rooms like bean curd blocks using wooden boards. Even under the stairs becomes a room, as long as it can hold a bed. Every family is like this. One low building houses many families, some involved in loan sharking, some unemployed, some selling "white powder"...

The rows of houses are built very close together, and sunlight is precious.

Like a valley, or the bottom of a well, sunlight cannot penetrate. Until noon, when the sun is at its highest, which would be a good time to enjoy it, the people in the alley all like "practicality". Bamboo poles are crossed like a net, with clothes and diapers hanging...

The sunlight is blocked again, and only wisps of light like mist shine into this dark, secluded alley from the gaps.

Chapter 19: Watching Flowers and Appreciating the Moon, Activities Lead to Marriage, Cultivating Jade and Conceiving Pearls Requires Skill

Jin Danyu originally wanted to take her group of sisters on a trip together. But after careful consideration: the He sisters would not be a problem. The longer they stayed in Shanghai, the better. Shao Huihua was also easy to discuss. She had just returned from Fujian and would not necessarily be sent elsewhere again, and she was interested in everything. Only Zhu Airen, a doctor and director in a hospital, was the question. Would she be willing to stay a few more days? And the Wu sisters, one a teacher and one a student, both had lessons every day. Could they ask for a day or two off? This would have to be discussed with them before a decision could be made. That day, Wu Junsu came, and the result of the discussion was, "The He sisters and Shao Huihua are no problem. Zhu Airen heard that she had come to Shanghai this time, and Dr. Zhang had asked her to do quite a few things, and she rarely comes to Shanghai anyway, so she can probably stay a few more days. However, my sister and I cannot stay in Shanghai any longer. Junke is graduating this year, and she has hopes of being sent to study in the United States. She has been working very hard lately, even studying on Sundays. After eating your wedding feast tomorrow, she will take the night train back that night. I originally had a class on Monday, but it is in the afternoon, so I plan to go back in the morning. But when we came, we were happily talking on the train, and the two He sisters wanted to visit the newspaper office where Shao Huihua works. Shao Huihua said: they would have to get permission from the office first before they could go together. She probably won't be free on Sunday, and plans to visit on Monday. And the appointment is on Monday evening, and Shao Huihua is even inviting us to dinner in the newspaper's big restaurant. I think: the newspaper industry is closely related to the literature department I teach in. History is the news of the past, and news is the history of the present. Students in our school are even required to visit newspaper offices. Therefore, when my younger sister Junke returns to school, I will ask her to take a day off on Monday and exchange my homework with a Teacher Zhou. Because he has exchanged with me before, but I must go back on Tuesday." Jin Danyu said, "Alright! Then Junke sister, I won't try to keep her for the sake of her studies. You must go back on Tuesday, and I won't force you to stay. But every week, from Saturday afternoon to Monday morning, you are free. Can't you accompany us to play during this time? I will definitely choose this time frame to travel, and I can even have a travel car pick you up in Suzhou." Wu Junsu smiled and said, "Why do you have to match my days? Don't you already have a lot of people?" (220)

### Letter from a Cotton Cloth Shop Apprentice: Please Pay Attention to Inferior Goods in Disguise

After reading the report from a rice industry child, I truly admire his spirit. Now I will report my situation, hoping that you will correct and disclose it, and I will be very grateful.

I am an apprentice who has just left school life and entered a cotton cloth shop. Our shop deals in fancy goods, but specializes in converting inferior goods into domestic goods. The procedure is: first, bring in a truckload of inferior goods, and immediately open the boxes. This only starts after dinner. First, tear off the wrapping paper, then cut off the inferior goods trademarks and signs at the ends of the cloth, and then stamp on our own unregistered trademark, and wrap it in wrapping paper with our own sign. Finally, pack it in unused wooden boxes. After packing, we brush the sign and the number of domestic goods on the boxes. After the procedure is complete, we go to buy tax forms and transport them to the inland and overseas to deceive compatriots and overseas Chinese. Please pay attention to the Shanghainese and compatriots everywhere, and do not be fooled by unregistered trademarks, as there are many black curtain types of cotton cloth. For example, the method I saw in a certain shop is to put inferior goods into a dyeing vat and turn them into blue cloth. They also put on unregistered trademarks and fill everywhere, so I advise compatriots to pay attention.

The Entertainment World

### The Problem of Morality in Peking Opera

— Ke Yunlou Zhu

Peking opera is recognized as the national opera because it has a complete structure and is rich in historical plots. The simple and beautiful customs of our country in the past, and the stories and achievements of great men and extraordinary scholars, are brought to the stage, influencing people and benefiting them greatly. These are role models, the true spirit of drama. In my spare time, I often linger in theaters, washing away the dust of the world, and also seeking a small degree of mental and physical avoidance of evil. However, I occasionally see one or two scripts with frivolous plots and shallow language, which I deeply detest and disapprove of, because they give customers a bad impression and especially give children unhealthy thoughts, causing people grief beyond measure. Based on my past impressions, I have recorded the following, including (1) "The Talented Son-in-Law," (2) "The Drunken Concubine," (4) "Spinning Cotton," (5) "The Iron Bow Romance," (6) "The Mistake in the Flower Field"... and others such as "Capturing Zhang Sanlang Alive." Examining its plot, it also tends towards the supernatural and absurd, but it contains the meaning of karma, a startling warning, and its performance does not greatly offend and still has its merits, so it is not limited here. As this country is facing many difficulties and the environment is deteriorating, it is the time for us to strive for progress. Therefore, even if it is entertainment, we must not forget the sincerity of saving the country. Therefore, for the above-mentioned scripts that are overly exaggerated and harm the body and mind, theater owners should abandon them, which is also a way to fulfill the duties of a citizen.

### Recent News from Overseas Silver Screen

— Qiu Wen

The Chinese Theater built by the Chinese Association of New York and the Chinese Drama Association and other groups on Doyers Street in New York has been completely completed and is expected to open in February next year. It is also heard that old and new Chinese dramas will be performed in succession at the theater in the future, and most of the actors will be members of the Chinese Drama Association. When possible, various meaningful Chinese films will be shown to promote them.

Shirley Temple's new work "The Little Darling," another work after "The Little Orphan Goose," has been completely filmed. The script of the film is taken from several sections of a British mythology story script. Shirley plays a fairy, so her style in the film is obviously innovative.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has decided to produce a full-color fairy tale historical film starring male and female child stars after "The Women." The script is based on the play "Peony Empress" by French writer Ms. Yagu Na. The company is now fully preparing for production and is expected to be completed before June 1940.

Norma Shearer's only surviving seven-year-old daughter, Manlei Ful, recently made a guest appearance as the adopted daughter of Pastor Tomali in her mother's film "Marie Antoinette." It is said that her performance was very good, so soon this future child star may be under the banner of Metro.

Two years ago, the Askote Theater in England successively screened two Chinese films, one was Lianhua Company's "The Great Road," and the other was Xinhua Company's "Diao Chan." Although these two films were only screened for five days at the theater, every show was sold out, which shows that the British people have a special interest in Chinese films. Recently, the theater's preview revealed that it will soon screen a Chinese film, which is "Wang Baochuan" produced by Yihua Company, directed by Wu Cun, and starring Zhang Cuihong and Li Ying. Because this script has been performed in London several times in the past, it has already won the praise of the British people, so this screening will undoubtedly cause a sensation among Chinese film fans in the city. It is also heard that when the film is screened, it will be accompanied by the screening of the Central Film Studio's recent Newsreel No. 16, "Victory in the Battle of Northern Hunan," which will give overseas Chinese in Britain an even more enthusiastic excitement.

### For the "Motherland"

— Hua

Excited, I just watched "Regret for the Late Ming Dynasty," and then I saw "Motherland."

Both scripts tell us that under the oppression of aggressors, a heroic struggle for the motherland will inevitably be aroused! Starting from this theme, Sha Du arranged a moving story for "Motherland." In the six-act play, he controlled the audience's emotions with moving plots and suffocated the audience's breath with impassioned lines. Two years after the fall of Shanghai, "Motherland" is a sharp blade that pierces the depths of everyone's hearts.

Look: After Spain conquered Flandes, how cruelly the people of Flandes were sentenced to death: hanged with hemp ropes; when the hemp ropes ran out, they were filled in the stinky ditches; when the stinky ditches were full of corpses, large pits were dug to bury them. As for the women, they were handed over to the soldiers for free "disposal!"

Look: How Li Suer and Galuo jointly attacked with the volunteer army in coordination with Prince William's army. After the unfortunate failure, how the bell-ringing old man gave his life for the country.

Look: For the motherland, how Li Suer forgave Galuo's injustice and unfriendliness, and entrusted him with the important responsibility—loyalty. For the motherland, how Galuo killed his lover Dololai.

Looking at the firelight behind the stage, watching Galuo leave my sight with firm steps, I heard again

a familiar song:

"Life is precious,

Love is even higher in price,

But for freedom,

Both can be discarded!"

### Talking About Music in Bars

— Han Ruo

In Shanghai, if you like to listen to music, you generally need to adopt the following methods to be able to hear it: (1) Turn on the radio to listen to broadcast music programs. (2) Wait for music concerts, such as the Landex Theater, the YMCA, etc., which occasionally have concerts. (3) Go to dance halls, and finally, you can only go to bars. The several ways to listen to music, except for bars, all have imperfections. First, not every family has a radio. Even if there is a radio, not every radio is very good and can receive clearly, and the programs you listen to always feel like there is a layer of space between them, making it uncomfortable to listen to. Secondly, concerts are very good, but they don't happen often. Thirdly, the music in dance halls, some of which is good, may not be unlistenable, but the environment feels a bit noisy, because listening to music in a quiet environment is always more suitable. So, all in all, to listen to music, it's still best to go to a good bar.

Most of the musicians in bars are of high caliber, because each bar's music team only has three or four people. Their keys and rhythms are very accurate, and they must be familiar with world-famous songs to be competent, otherwise they will not be able to perform in high-end bars. The composition of Shanghai bars is based on music, wine, and women, plus beautiful and artistic decorations, and perfect personnel management, so it becomes a place of leisure for Chinese and Western people. The music in the bars on the road is not bad. Knox, Pique-nique, etc., all have quiet music to listen to, especially the music in Knox, which can make music lovers linger. The singing and playing of the three musicians, Queerdo, Jack, and James, can be called the best. If you can name a song, they will be sure to play it for you.

### Anecdotes from Outside the Peking Opera World

— Xu Muyun

Several Patrons in the Banking World

Unexpectedly, the young master of a certain chairman in the Northeast also took a fancy to her. This person not only had power, but also a lot of money. Judging by his financial resources alone, he was not weaker than a certain banker. The two not only competed to support her, but also often brought a group of people to gamble in her residence. The money she earned each month from the gambling was considerable. However, the young master of a certain chairman was also a warrior with a rough temperament. Although they knew they were walking the same path, the certain banker always avoided him as much as possible. The certain Kun opera singer was also afraid of the warrior, so of course, whenever she received a call from the certain young master, she would often issue a soft eviction order, asking the certain banker to leave. So I said that the situation of this banker and that banker who supported Shu Yan was very similar. However, then again, the banker ultimately achieved the final victory. Shu Yan's personality was such that he couldn't get along with anyone for long, but he and his banker friend had never broken up for many years, and they are still very close now. According to rumors, all of Shu Yan's deposits are placed in that bank, with more favorable interest rates and extremely convenient withdrawals and deposits. Since the two have this kind of relationship, then of course they will not be separated. As for a certain Kun opera singer's friend, he has been unique in the past two or three years. It turned out that the certain young master had long left the old capital after the incident. He went to a strong enemy, and the joy in his heart can be imagined. (167)

This time, in order to raise funds for the Shanghai Shenzhou Night School Adult Compulsory Education and the North China Flood Relief, it will hold three days of charity performances in a row at the Golden Theater in mid-January after Zhang Eyun finishes performing. It is reported that the plays are very exciting, and the famous martial arts ticket king Mr. Jin Kui will be the main attraction for three days. Mr. Zhu has stopped performing Peking Opera for several years. This time, after repeated invitations, and because it concerns charity, he agreed to show off his skills.
