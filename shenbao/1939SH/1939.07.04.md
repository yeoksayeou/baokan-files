Editorial

### American Independence and China-America Relations

July, the great July, is the month symbolizing mankind's struggle for independence and freedom. In China, there is the "July 7th" Incident which launched the War of Resistance, and three days before July 7th is the Independence Day of the United States of America; six days later is the National Day of the French Republic. These kinds of coincidences, although accidental, also symbolize the common consciousness of the three major ethnic groups in Europe, America, and Asia, and symbolize the close friendship of the three major ethnic groups, which has its innate foundation. Today, on the American Republic's Independence Day, we especially wish the United States of America prosperous and at the same time, wish China's sacred national liberation war an early victory. China and the United States are the cornerstones of peace facing each other on the east and west banks of the Pacific Ocean, and they are also the two largest democratic countries in the world that love peace. Their cooperation will inevitably lay the foundation for peace in the Pacific and even the world. Therefore, in addition to publishing a "Special Edition for American Independence Day" today, our newspaper cannot help but state something more.

We first recall the arduous struggle of the American people for independence and liberation 163 years ago, which is no different from the bloody war of resistance of the Chinese people today. At that time, the United States was in a colonial position, without a long-trained army, without fully supplied military supplies, and Britain was holding the naval hegemony, and could fight up and down the Atlantic coast; however, under the leadership of Washington, the American people gave full play to their strong resistance with their determination to strive for independence and freedom. They adopted the skirmish tactics of the Indians, scattered in the vast and boundless countryside, giving the enemy the greatest trouble, making the enemy exhausted - this is quite similar to China's guerrilla warfare strategy today. They fought heroically and arduously for seven years, forcing Britain to run out of financial resources and unable to continue the war, and finally recognized the independence of the United States in 1783. The American Declaration of Independence is the most precious and earliest document in the modern democratic movement, and the American War of Independence is an immortal page in the history of national liberation in the world. It is also a valuable guide for all oppressed nations in the world; this is especially worthy of emulation by China in the War of Resistance today. Of course, due to the differences in time and space, it is not appropriate to compare everything, but China is indeed in a more favorable condition today; the result of two years of hard work has already revealed the prospect of victory. In short, the United States has become a great democratic and independent country from hard struggle, and China is moving towards the road of independence and liberation in hard struggle; therefore, it is of far-reaching significance to commemorate American independence in China today.

Secondly, we want to point out that the close friendship between China and the United States is not only because the United States' independent and equal traditional concepts sympathize with China's resistance; it is also because the United States and China's resistance are consistent in their interests. The aggressors' rampage in the Far East tore up various treaties traditionally advocated by the United States and closed the "open door" in China that the United States insisted on; not only were the United States' interests in the Far East swept away, but also the security of the United States' territories in the Far East has been directly harmed. President Roosevelt, who believes in "big ships and big guns," naturally cannot sit idly by and watch Japan dominate the Far East. Therefore, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the United States has taken a firm attitude from the beginning, opposing Japan's invasion of China. President Luo's speech in Chicago in October of the year before last made the White House's Far East policy clearer. But why can't Washington take more measures that are more favorable to China today? One is because it is worried that Britain's Far East policy is not thorough enough; the other is because it is constrained by several forces within the United States.

Originally, American diplomacy today is dominated by three forces: the first is the isolationist faction, who are influenced by traditional isolationism and blindly believe that as long as the United States is isolated, it will not be involved in war; the second is the capitalists who have slightly more investment in China and Japan, and they are hesitant about who will win or lose between China and Japan for the sake of their own private interests; the third is the righteous supporters and collective security system supporters who can truly represent American public opinion. The United States' attitude towards the Sino-Japanese War is almost entirely dominated by the agitation of these three forces.

As a result of China's two years of resistance, the first group of people in the United States should have realized it. Today, the losses that Japan's aggression against China has given to the United States have become increasingly serious, and the United States' status and prestige have been greatly hit. Isolationists should understand that the 20th century is definitely not an era in which isolation can be achieved; as for the few capitalists on Wall Street who invest in Japan, they should understand that after Japan monopolizes the Far East market, your commercial investment interests will also be fundamentally rejected. According to the statistics of the American Public Opinion Survey Association, 74% of Americans currently advocate supporting China, 2% oppose supporting China, and 24% do not know the truth and cannot express their opinions. We hope that the 2% of the opposition and the 24% who do not know the truth can also quickly realize and understand the position of the United States in the Sino-Japanese War, and know that helping China's resistance is not only for the interests of friendly countries, but also to protect the United States' interests in the Far East and to maintain the traditional glory of the United States.

The great Republic of America and the great Republic of China are standing on the same line. Today, on the eve of the victory of China's sacred resistance, it is also the glorious Independence Day of the United States. We hope that these two great nations will further cooperate hand in hand and jointly strive to oppose aggression and maintain human justice and world peace!

### Japanese Spokesman Says No Possibility of Reconciliation in Tianjin Case; "Provisional Government" Raises Various Demands; Japan Will Use Force If Britain Refuses to Accept; Tightening the Blockade of the Tianjin Concession

(Beiping) According to a Japanese military spokesman today, there is no possibility of reconciliation in the Tianjin incident. The British side must accept the various demands raised by the "Beiping Provisional Government." Otherwise, in order to achieve this goal, the Japanese side will not hesitate to use force. (Third Associated Press Dispatch)

(Beiping) Regarding the Tianjin dispute, the "Provisional Government" recently issued a message, announcing its demands to the British and French embassies. At the same time, the Japanese army in North China also issued a message, announcing its support for these demands. The demands include: (1) The British and French concessions cooperate with the monetary policy of the "Provisional Government." (2) Allow the "Provisional Government" to inspect banks and businesses in the concession. (3) Strictly control all publications and groups that violate the sentiments of the "Provisional Government." The Japanese military message supporting these demands stated that "the start of the blockade is purely necessary to maintain peace and the survival of the Japanese army," and also stated that these demands are "the call of all the people in North China." When asked by reporters whether there is room for compromise, the Japanese military spokesman replied: "No, at least not at present." (Third Reuters Dispatch)

(Beiping) The "Provisional Government" recently issued a message, stating that the British and French concession authorities have so far refused to recognize the new situation in East Asia and have allowed the concession area to be a hotbed of political and economic conspiracies of the Chinese government and a base of activities to undermine peace and order in North China, which is regrettable. It now makes five minimum demands to the British and French embassies. If the concession authorities refuse to accept them, the Provisional Government will take the necessary steps to deal with the situation. The five demands are as follows: (1) Immediately transfer terrorists and communists to the "Provisional Government." (2) Fully cooperate with the "Provisional Government's" monetary policy, especially prohibiting the circulation of legal tender in the concession and taking out the silver in the concession. (3) Fully cooperate with the "Provisional Government" to interrogate and inspect Chinese banks, businesses, and exchange merchants in the concession. (4) Strictly ban organizations, speeches, actions, and publications that are contrary to the "Provisional Government's" policies. (5) Fully recognize the above four points, and the "Provisional Government" and the concession authorities jointly implement joint management in the concession, so that concrete results can be achieved. (Third Reuters Dispatch)

(Tianjin) On the eve of the Tokyo Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Tianjin incident, the Japanese side seems to have tightened its blockade of the British and French concessions. In addition to the incident of stripping and inspecting British citizens that occurred again yesterday, at present, only very few milk products that can be used for human consumption are transported into the British concession. As for coal, virtually none is transported in. According to a milk deliveryman, he told a Reuters reporter that he tried to transport 200 bottles of milk into the concession. After waiting in line for inspection for five hours, the Japanese ordered him to pour all the milk into a large bucket. After inspecting the empty bottles, they ordered him to refill them. By the time the filling was completed, the milk had soured due to the heat. In addition, another milk deliveryman told the same experience. At the same time, the "black market" Chinese coal vendors in the British concession, who used to sell their coal at double the price, were also feeling frightened, because several mysterious Chinese people had stayed near their coal yards and asked them in detail about the amount of coal in stock. Since the blockade of the concession, general coal vendors can occasionally transport a small amount of fuel coal from the Special No. 3 District. However, it is heard that from today onwards, two Japanese armed motorboats have been strictly inspecting coal ships leaving the Special No. 3 District. Unless it can be fully proved and guaranteed that the coal being transported is not being transported to the British concession, they will not be allowed to pass. (Third Reuters Dispatch)

(Tianjin) The restrictions on the entrances and exits of the British and French concessions here seem to have been greatly tightened today. As a result, the number of perishable foods, milk, and fuel coal imported into the concession has been greatly reduced, almost to the lowest level during the most tense blockade. The lives of the poor Chinese people in the concession were already difficult, and recent developments have made their lives even more difficult. The Japanese side is preparing to hold an anti-British mass meeting on July 7, the second anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War. It is heard that this preparation is not limited to Tianjin. Other important cities in North China are also planning to follow the same procedure. The intention of the initiators of this new anti-British movement is to incite the unrest to recover foreign concessions in China. Newspapers under Japanese control in this area all publish radical anti-British articles, and radio stations also broadcast the same content. British expatriates in Tianjin are eagerly looking forward to the future Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo, with a lot of apprehension mixed in. The general feeling is that under Japan's display of power, a compromise will be reached, and the result will damage the prestige and future of every Western power in the Far East.

### Ministry of Finance Announces Regulations for Applying to Purchase Foreign Exchange; Full Text Consists of Six Articles; Effective on the Date of Announcement; Measures for Foreign Exchange Application and Verification Will Be Abolished Immediately

(Chongqing) Ministry of Finance Order: Now formulate and announce the Regulations for Applying to Purchase Foreign Exchange for Imported Goods. This order,

Regulations for Applying to Purchase Foreign Exchange for Imported Goods,

(1) Where the imported goods operated by importers are not on the list of prohibited imports and are necessary for domestic use, they may apply to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee to purchase foreign exchange in accordance with these regulations. (2) When applying to purchase foreign exchange, the applicant shall first fill in the application form with the name, quantity, price, place of import and sale of the goods to be purchased, and submit it together with the supporting documents to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee for examination, or submit it to the bank for transfer on behalf of the applicant. (3) When the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee approves the purchase of foreign exchange, it shall fill in a special foreign exchange purchase permit and notify the applicant and the designated Bank of China or Bank of Communications separately to handle it. (4) All foreign exchange approved for purchase shall be sold by the designated Bank of China or Bank of Communications at the legal price, but the applicant shall pay a balance fee equal to the difference between the legal price and the listed price of the two banks. (5) The applicant shall, upon completion of the purchase of foreign exchange, submit the original special foreign exchange purchase permit to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee for cancellation. (6) These regulations shall take effect from the date of promulgation, and all Measures for Foreign Exchange Application and Verification and Regulations for Foreign Exchange Purchase Application and Verification promulgated on March 12, 1938 shall be abolished immediately. (Third Dispatch)

### Dr. Kong's Opinion

(Chongqing) Dr. Kong issued an opinion on the Ministry of Finance's announcement of the Regulations for Applying to Purchase Foreign Exchange for Imported Goods, stating that the Ministry has repeatedly stipulated measures and actively implemented them for the purpose of consolidating finance and stabilizing the exchange rate market. On the one hand, it stipulates measures for the sale of foreign exchange earned from exported goods in order to enrich the foreign exchange fund. On the other hand, it still supplies the necessary foreign exchange for essential imported goods. In the spring of this year, the China-UK Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee was jointly established to handle the work of balancing the exchange rate market, which has greatly benefited merchants and people. However, in this extraordinary period, all citizens should practice economy and save on all luxury goods and non-essential goods for the purpose of national construction. As for domestic products, we should strive to export them to maintain the balance of international payments and benefit the national economy. However, in recent times, transportation has been difficult, and the cost of exported goods has increased. At the same time, unscrupulous people have devised countless tricks to obtain foreign exchange, and the foreign exchange market has experienced improper fluctuations. Although the Stabilization Fund has sufficient strength, it feels threatened by this impropriety. Therefore, we should carefully consider measures under the principle of preventing arbitrage and taking into account legitimate needs to benefit the national economy. Therefore, luxury goods and non-essential imported goods have been banned. Except for tung oil, tea, bristles, and minerals, which are related to barter and debt repayment, export goods should only be sold to the Bank of China or Bank of Communications at the legal price, and then obtain the difference between the legal price and the listed price of the two banks from the settlement bank with the foreign exchange settlement certificate to encourage their active operation and seek the development of production. At the same time, taking into account the legitimate commercial needs, all foreign exchange required for the purchase of imported goods that are indeed necessary for domestic use may be applied to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee for purchase. After approval, the designated bank will sell it at the legal price. However, since export goods have already enjoyed the benefit of the exchange rate difference, imported goods should be subject to a balance fee equal to the difference between the legal price and the bank's listed market price in order to be consistent and fair. By doing so, it will not only help stabilize the exchange rate market, but also supply the necessary domestic needs, and strictly prevent unscrupulous people from obtaining arbitrage. It is a temporary and necessary measure to cope with the environment in this extraordinary period. (Third Dispatch)

### British Expatriates in Fuzhou Refuse to Leave

(Hong Kong) Japanese warships have recently been wantonly harassing the coastal areas of Zhejiang and Fujian, and demanding that foreign expatriates in Fuzhou and Wenzhou evacuate. However, so far, foreign expatriates in the two places are still staying and have not left. British warships anchored in Fuzhou have even sent sailors ashore. John Hunt, the Anglican bishop of the area, sent a telegram to the Hong Kong Telegraph this morning, firmly stating that he would not evacuate. The original telegram stated that the British expatriates in Fuzhou had refused the advice of the naval authorities to evacuate to Hong Kong and would remain there. Only one family has left this area due to health reasons. There are currently more than 100 British expatriates in Fuzhou, including 40 missionaries. (Third Dispatch)

(London) During a meeting in the House of Commons today, someone asked about the situation in Fuzhou and Wenzhou. Deputy Foreign Secretary Butler replied that measures have been taken to allow the British in Fuzhou who wish to leave to evacuate. Although there are no British ships in the port there at the moment, the Japanese naval authorities have undertaken to reserve a safe entry and exit passage for British ships before July 7. Regarding Wenzhou, he heard that all foreigners there advocated staying. There are currently eleven British expatriates in the area. Butler acknowledged that Wenzhou is virtually blockaded, and the British government has protested against this. A member asked whether the British government could send a British fleet to the Baltic countries and Leningrad for a ceremonial visit. Butler replied that the government would consider this proposal, but it is unlikely to be realized in the near future. (Third Reuters Dispatch)

### General Headquarters Establishes Transportation Agency

### Conflicts Erupt Again on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia Border

(Tokyo) Reports have been received stating that yesterday, conflicts erupted again between Japanese-Manchukuoan forces and Soviet-Mongolian forces near Buinor Lake on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia border. According to a statement released today by the Kwantung Army in Changchun, the Kwantung Army and the Manchukuoan army joined forces on the 2nd of this month to drive out Soviet-Mongolian forces that had crossed the Khalkha River and invaded the territory of "Manchukuo." It was also stated that the Japanese army captured 20 enemy tanks. This morning, Japanese artillery and aircraft heavily bombed the outer Mongolian positions on the west bank of the Khalkha River. Losses are unknown. (3rd, Haitong News Agency dispatch)

(Tokyo) According to Japanese battlefield reports today, the Soviet-Mongolian artillery positions on the west bank of the Khalkha River have been silenced by heavy bombardment from Japanese artillery and air force. It is also said that the Soviet-Mongolian forces in that area were surrounded by Japanese puppet forces at 2 PM today. The crossings on the Khalkha River have been cut off by the Japanese army, thus cutting off the retreat of the Soviet-Mongolian troops who invaded the territory of the "puppet" state. In this battle, the Japanese side captured 30 Soviet tanks. (3rd, Associated Press dispatch)

Hailar: A reporter saw three Soviet E-16 fighter planes patrolling the skies over "Manchukuo" today. However, when Japanese planes took off to attack, the three planes quickly flew back.

### US Public Opinion Poll Results The Majority of the Public Sympathizes with China Those Who Sympathize with China Account for 74 Percent, While Those Who Sympathize with Japan Account for Only 2 Percent

New York Air News: The attitude of American public opinion towards the Far Eastern situation has undergone major changes since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937. According to a public opinion research institute, in 1937, 47 percent of Americans sympathized with China, 2 percent sympathized with Japan, and 51 percent remained neutral. As of now, while the percentage of those who sympathize with Japan remains at 2 percent, the percentage of those who sympathize with China has increased to 74 percent, while the percentage of those who remain neutral has decreased to 24 percent. Therefore, if the United States were to intervene in the Far Eastern situation to benefit China at this time, it would definitely receive the support of more than half of the people. As for the issue of boycotting Japanese goods, the change in public opinion is even more significant. In 1937, only 37 percent favored it, but now it has increased to 66 percent, while those who oppose it account for only 34 percent. In addition, the Public Opinion Research Institute previously posed the question to people from all walks of life: "Do you think the United States should ban the shipment of arms and ammunition to Japan?" The results have now been revealed: 72 percent favor it, while 28 percent oppose it. Conversely, regarding the issue of banning the shipment of arms and ammunition to China, 40 percent favor it, while 60 percent oppose it. The direction of American public opinion can be seen from this. (Havas)

### Rumor that Japan Asks the US to Mediate the War

(Washington) According to rumors here, the Japanese government has asked a powerful businessman to make informal contacts with the US government, asking the United States to mediate the Sino-Japanese War and to provide loans to Japan. According to those familiar with the situation, this plan is obviously impossible, so the State Department will definitely not give it any consideration. (3rd, Associated Press dispatch)

American Carlo Village: Dr. Brock, a member of the secretariat of the Pacific Council of International Relations, stated today at the University of Virginia that, according to his observation, China will definitely win the final victory in this Sino-Japanese War. The result of Japan's invasion of China is nothing more than turning China from weak to strong. He also said that Britain and the United States should bear a major responsibility for the post-war reconstruction work in the Far East, because China's economic recovery after victory will depend on large-scale investments from Britain and the United States. (3rd, Associated Press dispatch)

### London Aid China Committee Holds "China Week" Assemblies and Parades Are Held in the Suburbs for Several Days

(London) The Aid China Committee is currently holding China Week, with the aim of arousing public opinion to aid China. A special publication called "China News" was released today, containing an editorial by the famous American novelist Priestley, saying that we must see that British policy is not to assist a barbaric aggressor, but to aid a persevering self-defender. The newspaper also contains articles by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Mao Zedong, British Consul-General in Tianjin Jameson, and important figures from India and Malaysia. On July 5, the Friendship Society will hold a mass rally to protest the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin, which will be chaired by Lord Lytton, the former chief commissioner of the League of Nations' Three Eastern Provinces investigation team. Thirty marches and rallies distributing leaflets will be held in the suburbs of London this week. Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, and Leicester will also have similar actions. China Week ends next Sunday. (3rd, Reuters dispatch)

### American Church in Xiangyang Destroyed by Bombing

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources received here today, when Japanese planes bombed Nanyang on Tuesday, they hit the Norwegian Lutheran Church, the Chinese Girls' Primary School, and the Girls' Vocational School. One hundred residential buildings were destroyed. It is also heard that when the Norwegian Lutheran Church was hit, more than a dozen Chinese civilians were bombed to death. Also, according to Mr. and Mrs. Mason, American missionaries from Xiangyang who arrived here today, the buildings of the American Church in Xiangyang have been completely destroyed. According to Mason, although the roofs of the American Church all had American flags, no fewer than 15 bombs hit the church. Also, the marketplace of Xiangyang City has been bombed by Japanese planes in the past few weeks and has become a field of rubble. However, the population has already been evacuated, so casualties are not large. (3rd, Associated Press dispatch)

### Chamberlain Reads the King's Speech Reaffirms Determination to Resist Aggression Thanks the Nation's Youth for Eagerly Enlisting Says He Still Wishes to Live in Peace with All Countries

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain made a broadcast speech last night, reaffirming Britain's determination to resist aggression, saying, "Let no one misunderstand, if we or the countries whose independence we guarantee are subjected to aggression requiring our resistance, we will not hesitate to go all out." The Prime Minister also read King George VI's edict to the nation's defense, in which the King thanked the people for enlisting in the military on behalf of the nation, and mentioned the happiness he felt when he and the Queen watched the National Voluntary Service Corps parade in Hyde Park that afternoon. He continued, "In My view, this is the most solemn expression of the spirit of service. Today, this spirit can be seen everywhere in the country. This can show the nation's determination to prepare for any emergency, no matter what sacrifices and inconveniences it will suffer. Our National Army has now been established. The call has been answered. The volunteer corps has begun its work. I want them to know how much I admire their spirit of public service, and I want to express my gratitude to their wives, because the women are willing to give up their family life and allow their husbands to serve the country in the evening. I dare to say that volunteer corps, whether men or women, will receive rewards in their conscience, because they have helped the country and made it strong and peaceful, so their hearts can be comforted. When I watched the parade, I couldn't help but think of the newly added strength of the National Defense Forces. The rapid and enthusiastic response of the youth to the call is enough to prove that the service they have joined is traditionally worthy of respect. Furthermore, reservists and National Defense Force soldiers, leaving their work and leaving their families, have come together at this time to guard our country, which also makes Me unforgettable. All of them, together with the regular army and auxiliary personnel, have consistently and firmly shouldered their great responsibilities. The country should express its gratitude to them. Our people should know that all our country's military preparations are not intended to challenge, but to maintain peace. We still hope that all countries can live together in friendship, but we will never allow any defects in maintaining national security. The contribution of the National Service Volunteer Corps to this work is particularly worthy of gratitude."

After the Prime Minister finished reading the King's speech, he added some very powerful words and a clear and unmistakable warning, saying, "We are now at a time of life and death. We ourselves are a peaceful nation and do not want to fight with anyone. But let no one misunderstand that if we need to resist aggression against us or against the countries whose independence we are responsible for maintaining, we will not hesitate to go all out." The Prime Minister mentioned the review ceremony of the National Voluntary Service Corps, saying that this is a real innovation in our history, because the people's army has been recognized as the fourth army, standing shoulder to shoulder with the auxiliary forces of the other three combat armies to form a solid part of our country's national defense, which is still the first time. The Prime Minister continued, this is a natural development, because everyone realizes that the war in the new era is no longer the same as in the past, but will be a conflict of national armed forces. In the present era, civilians should also be in the front line to assist domestic defense. Since it is the responsibility of every citizen, we ask you what kind of obligations you can fulfill in national service. You have now responded, and in a few months, about 1.25 million volunteers have joined various defense forces. The spirit expressed by the National Voluntary Service Corps cannot be praised in words. I know that many of you give up your evening entertainment and rest after a hard day's work to receive training, so that you can be summoned at any time to take on effective service in case of emergency. Our National Army is now becoming more complete, and you can enjoy the glory that has long existed in the combat army. We are deeply aware of what you have done, and it must have greatly increased our confidence in calmly coping with the future. (3rd, Reuters dispatch)

Hitler Should Understand The Change in British Public Opinion

(London) All the newspapers here have recently commented on the international situation. The Daily Express and the Daily Telegraph both said that Britain's current attitude is serious and meticulous, which should be understood by German leader Hitler. The Daily Express wrote: "The British cabinet has not been reorganized, and the cabinet members who signed the Munich Agreement are still in office, while those who oppose the appeasement policy are still in the opposition. It is reasonable that leader Hitler does not fully understand the change in British public opinion, which has a very dangerous impact. The British government should officially inform leader Hitler of the location of its national public opinion through diplomatic channels so that there is no possibility of misunderstanding. However, empty talk is of no practical help. It is also possible that the remarks made by our country's politicians will never be heard by leader Hitler. The only way is to take decisive and rapid action, act decisively and resolutely, so that leader Hitler will not misunderstand." The Daily Telegraph wrote that it is rumored that the British cabinet may be reorganized, and Churchill, the leader of the far right of the Conservative Party, will be invited to join the cabinet. In fact, what the people of the country are asking for is to reorganize the cabinet on the current basis. Not only Churchill should be recruited into the cabinet. The urgent task now is not to make rapid changes to the cabinet's foundation, but to recruit capable personnel to assist Prime Minister Chamberlain, which is enough to meet the expectations of most of the people."

The Statements of the British and French Authorities Are Completely Consistent

(Paris) The newspapers here recently commented on the international situation, saying that the statements made by the British and French authorities recently are completely consistent. They also praised King George VI's speech at the review of the National Voluntary Service Corps members yesterday. The right-wing Paris Echo published a dispatch from a reporter stationed in London stating that the British and French governments should take diplomatic action to make the statements recently made by the authorities of each country more powerful. "As far as we know, the British and French governments have solemnly provided guarantees to the Polish government, stating that if the country is subjected to direct aggression, they will definitely provide assistance." The right-wing Little Parisian newspaper wrote that Britain is determined to ensure national security without any slack. "The important British cabinet members have repeatedly issued warnings, and the King has also publicly expressed his opinion, swearing an oath and resolutely expressing his will. In essence, although the country is working for peace, it is also prepared to resist all aggressive attempts with all its strength, which is already beyond doubt." The right-wing Little Daily wrote, "Although Britain, France, and Poland are preparing to hold negotiations, they are determined to resist aggression. All humiliating concessions and humiliating compromises are unacceptable." The right-wing Times wrote, "Maintaining the current status of the Free City of Danzig is necessary to maintain the independence of Poland, and the independence of Poland is necessary to maintain the security of France. Based on this, all French citizens have the responsibility to protect the Free City of Danzig. The situation is the same in Britain. As far as our country's national defense is concerned, the port of Gibraltar is a fortress for protecting our country's mainland and the traffic lines of the colonies, while the Rhine and Vistula Rivers are both barriers to our country and are very important. In addition, the statements made by Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier and British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax have caused a profound impression on the German side. However, if the British and French authorities can further take various measures in finance and military affairs, they can fully express their interests that are vital to their survival and their determination to cooperate to maintain them, so that Germany will no longer have any doubts." The Radical Socialist Party's Business Newspaper wrote, "The Danzig issue and any disputes that may arise between Germany and Poland are sufficient to immediately cause a tense situation. This is the view of the British and French governments, which has been formally notified to Germany. Therefore, the German officialdom is still hesitating until last night as to which direction is most suitable for German-Polish relations." (3rd, Havas dispatch)

### France Explains Its Attitude to Germany

(Paris) The German Ambassador to France, Welczek, met with Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday to exchange views on the current situation in Europe. The "Times" commented on this, saying, "The firm position adopted by France is the same as that of Britain. It is determined to fulfill all obligations arising from the current agreements. All of this has been officially notified to the German government by Foreign Minister Bonnet at the most appropriate time and through normal diplomatic channels. This is an important factor for the future development of the international situation, and it is in line with the spirit and letter of the Franco-German peace declaration signed on December 6 last year (stipulating that in the event of international tensions, the two governments should immediately exchange views). The French government believes that notifying Germany of France's position at this time is very beneficial to peace. What is the position? That is, France cannot agree to any unilateral attempt to change the legal status of the Free City of Danzig or to undermine the status quo in Eastern Europe. This is the same as what is seen in Britain. The guarantees provided by the British and French governments to Poland are extremely clear and practical and will be fulfilled under any circumstances. The German government will have no doubts about this after receiving Ambassador Welczek's report. In short, Foreign Minister Bonnet's words to the German ambassador, although very humble, were very firm. He did not blame Germany, nor did he provoke it, nor did he directly or indirectly threaten it. He only officially notified the German government of the real situation for reference. All kinds of misunderstandings can be eliminated as a result. (2nd, Havas dispatch)

### Danzig Nazi Leader Announces: Local People All Wish to Return to Germany. How the Future Unfolds Depends on Hitler's Word. Hess Says the German Western Line is Impenetrable.

Danzig – The Danzig Nazi Party leader, Forster, gave a speech yesterday at the district party congress, stating that the people of Danzig are united and wish to return to Germany. They are prepared to make any sacrifice to achieve this goal, even sacrificing their lives. Forster's speech was repeatedly interrupted by cheers. Forster continued, addressing Britain and its allies, "We have taken a firm stance and wish to return to Germany. The power of the German leader's word is, in our view, ten thousand times greater than all the cries of war and false incitements in the world. The people of Danzig need not alarm each other. Poland has no means to intimidate us. If the German leader grants freedom to Danzig, the German people here will unite and pledge their loyalty to the leader and Germany, and will be prepared to make any sacrifice for the leader, not only material but also blood and life. Countries adopting an encirclement policy are now violating the principle of national self-determination they advocate and are preparing to fight. They are preparing to hand Danzig over to Poland and are unwilling to satisfy the people of Danzig's desire to return to Germany." (Reuters, 3rd)

(Berlin) The Nazi Party's mouthpiece in the Free City of Danzig, the "Danziger Vorposten," reported yesterday that "The incorporation of the Free City of Danzig into Germany is inevitable; it is only awaiting German leader Hitler's decision on the date." Foreigners here are very interested after reading this, saying that although this is only newspaper opinion, the newspaper is the mouthpiece of the Nazi Party, and the Nazi Party is, in fact, the ruler of the Free City of Danzig, so its significance is particularly worthy of attention. The Nazi Party's attempt to incorporate the Free City of Danzig into German territory has been a long-standing one, but the means it intends to take have not been announced. Today, the question lies in choosing a suitable time. In addition, Hitler's representative, Hess, gave a speech in Kaiserslautern today, saying, "Germany now looks to the future with a calm attitude, waiting for major events to come." This statement can be equated with the report in the "Danziger Vorposten." (Havas, 2nd)

(Berlin) German leader Hitler's representative, Hess, gave a speech at the Kassel Rautern Party Congress last night, sternly warning the world not to doubt the strength of Germany's western border fortifications. Although the situation is unstable, no country has any reason to drive its soldiers to commit such suicide. If anyone attempts a large-scale attack on the aforementioned fortifications, they will encounter unimaginable disaster. Germany is very confident about the future and is now calmly watching the changes. (Reuters, 2nd)

Kaiserslautern, Germany – Leaders of the Nazi Party's western branches in Germany held a meeting here today. Hitler's representative and Minister Without Portfolio Hess gave a speech, praising the strength of the German-Italian-Japanese alliance and attacking Britain's policies, the Jews around the world, and the so-called "encirclement" policy. He said that the German people and the state, as well as the leader, are now completely integrated, which is an unprecedented phenomenon in German history. The German people have a clear understanding of their own strength and have never been so aware of it as they are today. In short, the Germans have now become a politically sound nation, with a very clear understanding of various issues related to the future of the country. The world should not despise this. Our enemies are still trying to alienate our government and people, falsely claiming that they are only opposed to our government, not the people. This trick is childish and ridiculous. Britain is now uneasy on behalf of a certain country, fearing that it will be reduced to a vassal of major powers. We can answer this in one sentence: twenty years ago, Germany was also reduced to a vassal of major powers. Why didn't Britain pay attention to this at that time? As for the encirclement policy, the agreements established by certain countries are, in practice, purely forced by human effort. These countries have different interests in ideology, politics, and economics, and their internal relations have not yet been coordinated. On the contrary, the German-Italian axis shares the same interests, and the military strength of the German-Italian-Japanese triangle is extremely strong. How can the encirclement policy have any hope of success? Our western border has now been built into the "Siegfried Line," which is as solid as a rock, and no one can cross it. In short, foreigners can do whatever they want, or even listen to the international Jewish community, but Germany should look to the future with a calm attitude, waiting for major events to come. (According to the translation of the German News Agency sent to foreign reporters, this last sentence was included, but it has been deleted in the German manuscript sent to German newspapers.) In addition, Nazi Party Commissioner for the Province of Austria, Bürckel, also gave a speech, saying, "France would sacrifice peace and cede the Sanjak region to Turkey as the price for Turkey's joining the peace front. Why not make another sacrifice now and return Germany's old colonies to Germany?" (Havas, 2nd)

Mannheim, Germany – Nazi Party representative Hess gave a speech here yesterday at the Western Nazi Party Congress, explaining Germany's current position, saying that since the Treaty of Versailles was established, Germany has deeply understood that its purpose was to turn Germany into a slave of the great powers. Therefore, the leaders of Nazism took all steps to resist. Today, no matter how other countries encircle us, Germany will do its best to resist to ensure that it does not become enslaved. Hess then mentioned that British politicians criticized Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. British politicians said that the existence of a free Ireland does not endanger Britain's security. Hess refuted this, saying that only the Irish themselves know the extent of Ireland's freedom. However, if Ireland did what Czechoslovakia did to Germany, concluding an anti-British pact with another country, would Britain still be able to say it was safe? Could British politicians sleep soundly? This is why Germany established a protectorate in Bohemia and Moravia. (Haitong, 3rd)

### Berliners Deliberately Show Calm

(Berlin) Everything here is very calm. Newspapers publish short articles discussing rumors about Danzig published in London and Paris newspapers, but Berliners seem to show no surprise about this. Yesterday, Hitler attended the state funeral of General Knochinhol, commander of the Tenth Army Corps in Hamburg. (Reuters, 2nd)

### Chamberlain Reports on the Danzig Situation in the House of Commons, Expresses Support for Poland's Attitude

(London) At the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain presented a report on the situation in the Free City of Danzig, stating that, according to reliable sources, the Free City authorities have taken various military measures, and the number of Germans entering the city of Danzig is increasing. Nazi Party members are organizing volunteer teams. Given the situation, the British government is maintaining close contact with the Polish and French governments. Opposition Labor Party member Dalton immediately asked whether the government approves of the attitude held by the Polish government. The Prime Minister replied that the Polish government's attitude is highly praised by our government (all members cheered). Opposition Labor Party member Cox then asked whether the Danzig Free City authorities are currently building fortifications, and whether this violates treaty obligations. Also, if Germany uses force to change the current status of Danzig, the British government will certainly intervene, but he wondered if the government intends to notify German leader Hitler of this. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "Regarding the violation of the treaty, I would like to ask the honorable member to submit a written inquiry. Regarding Britain's attitude, Foreign Secretary Halifax has already made it clear." (Havas, 3rd)

### British Diplomacy Actively Engaged

(London) Diplomatic activities here are quite active. Prime Minister Chamberlain received the British Ambassador to Poland, Sir Kennard, this morning, and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax was also present. Ambassador Kennard immediately reported on the latest situation in Warsaw and left after half an hour. The Prime Minister then went to Buckingham Palace to see the King and report on the situation. French Ambassador Corbin returned to the country this morning to report on his duties and returned to his post this morning. In addition, the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to meet this afternoon to discuss the international situation. At that time, the report submitted by the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, on his meeting with Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov yesterday will be submitted for research. (Havas, 3rd)

### British and French Newspapers Report: The Situation is Easing

(Paris) The period that some people believed last week would be a time when incidents would occur has now quietly passed. Today, newspapers here predict that Germany will not take sudden action in Danzig immediately, as the firm stance taken by Britain and France has had a psychological effect. (Reuters, 3rd)

(Paris) Today, newspapers in Paris unanimously said that the situation in Danzig has eased. The daily headline was that the tension in Danzig has eased. The "Petit Journal" also said that the situation in Danzig is calmer, but British and French cabinet members believe that the general situation has not yet escaped the serious stage. (Haitong, 3rd)

(London) British newspapers have been widely reporting for days that Germany will launch a coup in Danzig within days. Today, they suddenly changed their attitude, saying that the situation in Danzig has eased. "As a result of the German government's final consideration, it decided to postpone the coup." The "Daily Express" stated that the British government was able to foresee this news and prevent a sudden invasion because of the speed and success of British secret operations in obtaining information. (Haitong, 3rd)

### French Vietnam to Levy Special Taxes to Fund Local Military Expenses

(Paris) Colonial Minister Mantel recently submitted a report to President Lebrun, explaining the defense situation in French Vietnam and requesting that an order be issued to levy special taxes in Vietnam to fund the expansion of military equipment there. The main points of the report stated that French Vietnam can mobilize 100,000 soldiers one month after the mobilization order is issued. Their weapons are very sophisticated, and their commanders are rich in military knowledge. At this time, the number of troops stationed in Vietnam has doubled compared to a year ago, and weapons are also very sufficient. A munitions factory is under construction, and another aircraft factory can manufacture 150 aircraft and 400 engines annually in a short period of time. The government previously issued bonds worth 400 million francs on May 24, 1938, as funding for strengthening Vietnam's defense. This amount was quickly fully subscribed, but by the end of the month, this amount was insufficient. It is now planned to levy special taxes locally to inject funds. (Havas, 3rd)

(Paris) A communiqué was issued announcing that the French government has approved the decree on the collection of special taxes on land, sea, and air transportation decided by the "Supreme Council of Finance of the Red River Delta" in French Vietnam. This tax increase is for national defense purposes, as the French government hopes that the colonies can bear some of the military expenses to reduce the burden on the mother country. It is estimated that this tax increase will allow Vietnam to collect 140,000,000 francs in taxes. (Haitong, 3rd)

### Roosevelt Reduces the Purchase Price of Foreign Silver, Intending to Prevent Speculation and Profiteering. Financial News Says the Future of Silver Prices is Bleak

(London) Although people in London want to know the clear reasons for the recent developments in American silver policy, they cannot obtain them. Financial News refers to this as silver chaos, saying that although the US Senate's rejection of President Roosevelt's request to extend the right to buy foreign silver was sudden, like a bolt from the blue, it was still something that could be understood. What is surprising is that the Treasury Department reacted to the Senate's attack by repeatedly reducing its purchase price of foreign silver, giving the world market a new blow. People in the London market believe that President Roosevelt's reduction of the purchase price of foreign silver was not motivated by a desire to prevent speculators from profiteering, but by a desire to sacrifice the foreign silver market to appease the silver faction members of Congress. This argument is not without merit, but the US authorities may feel that lowering the purchase price of silver can raise the domestic silver price, as demanded by the silver faction members of Congress. If this is indeed the case, then the future of world silver prices is truly bleak. Since 1934, silver has been manipulated by the United States. Now that the United States is no longer the supporter of the world silver market, the world silver market can only collapse with it. (Reuters, 3rd)

### US Defense Budget Breaks Records

(Washington) The full amount of the Army's supplemental budget request, totaling $293,895,547, will be used to expand the Air Force, and has been passed by both the House and Senate, and signed into law by the President today. Since then, the total amount of the US defense budget for 1939-40 has reached $1,783,187,847, breaking all previous records. According to the Army's additional funding, in addition to ordering 2,500 aircraft, so that the US Air Force's first-line aircraft will be increased to 5,500 before July 1, 1941, it will also be used to build five air force bases, one in the US Alaskan Peninsula, one on the island of Puerto Rico, one in the Panama Canal Zone, and the other two in the northeastern and southeastern states of the United States, where sites will be selected separately. In addition, funds have been allocated to consolidate the defenses of the Panama Canal Zone. (Havas, 2nd)

### Japanese Industry in Trouble

(Washington) According to US Secretary of Commerce Hopkins, Japan's industry lacks the machines, raw materials, and skilled workers it needs. Most of the machines, such as those used to manufacture automobiles and aircraft, as well as machines and tools used in rayon factories, pulp mills, and mining, must be supplied by other countries. Many factories often cannot deliver the goods ordered by customers for two years due to the lack of machines and skilled workers. (Associated Press, 3rd)

### Investigation into the British Submarine Accident Underway

(London) British Attorney General Sommerville, representing the Admiralty, began investigating the sinking of the British submarine Thetis today, saying that he intends to investigate the following matters: (1) The testimony of the four survivors regarding the circumstances of the accident; (2) The general procedures regarding the trial runs of the commissioned warships and the history and previous trial runs of Thetis; (3) The Thetis Davis safety device and its implementation training and instructions; (4) Testimony of the tugboat accompanying Thetis; (5) The steps taken when the submarine did not surface and ships and aircraft were dispatched to search for and assist; (6) The actions of the rescue ship when the location of the submarine was found; (7) Evidence of the Admiralty's policy on protecting the safety of submarine personnel. The Attorney General also said that the authorities have repeatedly given careful consideration to the best methods of protecting the lives of submarine personnel. Therefore, Thetis has two peace rooms with Davis safety devices in the hull. Thetis was making its final trial run when it sank on June 1. Some discussions were held on the arrangements in the boat that morning, which may be of great importance. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Anglo-French-Soviet Alliance May Reach Agreement Tomorrow. Molotov Received the British and French Ambassadors Yesterday, Personally Handing Over the Soviet Response to the New Proposal

(London) At the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain reported on the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, stating that the last proposal of Britain and France was sent to Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov on the first of this month, and the Soviet Union is awaited to submit an answer. If there are no unexpected delays, there will be a statement to the House by the fifth of this month. Opposition Labor Party member Strollers immediately asked what kind of issues are currently hindering the establishment of negotiations in principle. The Prime Minister declined to answer. (Havas, 3rd)

(Moscow) Regarding the issue of the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, after Britain and France put forward new proposals the other day, Foreign People's Commissar Molotov is scheduled to receive the British and French ambassadors at noon today to personally hand over the Soviet response. (Havas, 3rd)

The Hague – Regarding the progress of the current negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, officials here recently stated that the Netherlands has not participated in the negotiations in any way and is determined to maintain a neutral policy. (Havas, 3rd)

(London) Negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union have been going on for several weeks without results, and the atmosphere is very depressing. This morning, the tone of The Times suddenly became more optimistic, because Soviet newspapers published Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech at the Foreign Affairs Institute on the first page, which clearly shows their friendliness towards Britain or their emphasis on the British Foreign Secretary's remarks. (Haitong, 3rd)

### German Munitions Shipped Incessantly: Danzig Preparing for War More Urgently. High-Altitude Anti-Aircraft Guns Placed on Hilltops, Soldiers Busily Exercising. However, Both Germany and Poland Are Doing Their Best to Avoid Conflict.

Danzig – Although the situation in Danzig is superficially peaceful, the barracks are full of soldiers, anti-aircraft guns are being placed on the hills of Bishop's Hill, and the forts and barracks are being renovated and new ones built in a tense atmosphere. Large quantities of munitions are secretly landed at night. All of this reflects the tension in the dark. Soldiers in the barracks are conducting large-scale exercises in front of the residents of the Free City, which they are not used to seeing, so they often stop to watch. Polish sources claim that they are fully aware of these developments and can await them with confidence. The Nazi Party denies that anything is malicious. On the German side of the Polish-German border in the Feel district of the Corridor, ripe and unripe grains are being harvested, and barbed wire obstacles are being hastily placed there. Both Poland and Germany have ordered that small incidents that could trigger events be avoided, and everyone is carefully complying with this. Yesterday, the streets presented the usual Sunday scene, but there are no longer men of military age or comrades in military uniform strolling among the crowds. These men are all "in service." The only exception was the Free City soldiers regrouping for the 36th Regiment of the 2nd Field Artillery of West Prussia. The soldiers of the regiment marched in formation from the Hörschschel barracks to the War Memorial, where they held a brief memorial service, and then dispersed. Although German soldiers in military uniform are commonplace in the streets of Danzig, their neatly dressed blue-gray uniforms attracted a lot of attention. The current German-Polish stalemate may soon be broken by the Polish representatives in the Senate. Residents of Danzig watched last night from the Sopot pier as Polish warships, merchant ships, and fishing boats, brightly lit, passed through the bay in succession. The Polish banquet held in Gdynia was very lively. General Haller, who established the Polish Legion in the French army during the World War, was on the same ship as Cardinal Hlond and twelve bishops. (Reuters, 3rd)

Warsaw – In an extremely tense situation, light artillery, tanks, and other military supplies continue to arrive in Danzig, and several military transport ships continue to arrive at the port docks, unloading light tanks, artillery vehicles, etc. ashore. These weapons are being transported to the forts of Gischauersberg and Henkersberg. The roads leading to the two places are still closed to casual visitors. According to Reuters diplomatic correspondents, the Polish government will apparently not take swift action due to the events currently occurring, such as the continued arrival of large numbers of German tourists in Danzig. The Polish government mouthpiece, the Polish Gazette, today carried news from London and Paris that if Germany attempts to launch an attack, Britain and France will intervene. The newspaper's London correspondent solemnly declared that the British public will back this stance. The Conservative newspaper Graz wrote a message saying that its government had received information that Germany intends to launch an incident at the present or in the near future, but the newspaper had not heard anything about the above statement and said that if Germany's recent actions were purely a political tactic, then Poland should express its gratitude, because they have clarified the situation and made Poland open its eyes. The newspaper also said that Poland is now quite calm, but if Germany wants to fight with us, it will not refuse to deal with it. A non-partisan newspaper also carried news from London and Paris, including a rumor that the British and French fleets would visit Gdynia. Polish newspapers across the country attach great importance to and praise the British Labor Committee's appeal to the German people to insist on resolving all disputes with reason and not with force. Landlords throughout Poland have been ordered to build air raid shelters and complete them within two months. (Reuters, 3rd)

(London) London officials know nothing about the rumors from Warsaw that British and French warships will sail to Gdynia. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Polish Authorities Plan to Deal with the Situation, Request the Danzig City Council to Explain the Reasons for the Military Action

Warsaw – The Polish government is said to have sent a strongly worded dispatch to the Danzig City Council, requesting an explanation for the recent military actions. According to Polish newspapers, Danzig's preparations for war are now proceeding rapidly. It is said that Warsaw is completely satisfied with the guarantee given by the British government. Last night, the British Chargé d'Affaires, Norton, again visited Polish Foreign Minister Beck to discuss the latest developments in the international situation. (Reuters, 3rd)

Warsaw – Polish High Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, returned to the country the other day to report on his duties, and was received by General Inspector of the Army Smigly-Ridz and Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, who gave him instructions. When Chodacki returns to his post within days, he will enjoy special powers to deal with the situation in Danzig. It is rumored that Britain, France, and Poland intend to jointly negotiate with the Danzig authorities, either directly or through the High Commissioner of the League of Nations stationed in Danzig, to express their attitude of complete unity. Foreign observers here, however, believe that this may not be implemented and that Chodacki will only represent the Polish government and send a dispatch to the Danzig City Council, informing it that the city's legal status does not allow it to be armed, and asking what are the reasons for the various military measures taken by the city authorities recently, or a warning should be issued that if the rights Poland has in the Free City are harmed, it will be considered an infringement on Poland's independence. However, violent actions may not occur in Danzig for a while. It seems that the intention of the city authorities is to gradually equip themselves to prevent Poland from sending troops to occupy it. The German government is trying to make the outside world believe that the accidents that occur in Danzig are purely internal affairs, and Germany avoids intervening. This can be seen from the fact that the Polish government was formally notified of the German cruiser "Königsberg's" sailing to Danzig in August. (Havas, 2nd)

### Central European Currencies All Set to Devalue

(London) Well-informed sources here recently declared that Central European countries, especially Poland and Romania, whose independence is guaranteed by Great Britain, will all implement currency devaluation. The reason being that the prices of raw materials and manufactured goods produced by these countries are too high to compete with products from the United States, Africa, the Scandinavian Peninsula, or Eastern countries. The inevitable result is that they have to enter into barter agreements with Germany, thus becoming controlled by German economic power. Therefore, adjusting the prices of various products has long been necessary, and currency devaluation is bound to be effective in making these adjustments. Furthermore, Central European countries' exports to countries with free exchange are also affected by import quotas, hindering their development, which is another reason for their economic difficulties. In addition to this, there are various political considerations that are also sufficient to drive Central European countries to devalue their currencies. Poland and Romania have consulted with Great Britain about loans, but so far, the British Treasury has only granted a portion, which both countries consider insufficient. Poland claims it cannot afford the raw materials needed for its military industry, while Romania says it cannot resist German economic power. Experts at the British Treasury have therefore advocated lending to Poland and Romania to establish exchange equalization funds to protect their currency positions, while at the same time, the currency value should be reduced to increase exports. The funds they borrow can also be used to increase prices in terms of manufactured goods and wages. The British and French governments are currently exchanging views with the governments concerned, and it is hoped that an agreement can be reached in the short term. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

### Yugoslavia Advocates Neutrality Dissatisfied with Turkey's Mutual Assistance with Britain and France

The "Politika" newspaper in the capital of Yugoslavia recently published an editorial, seemingly on semi-official instructions, stating that the mutual assistance declaration signed by Turkey with Great Britain and France contradicts the Balkan Entente Pact. Article 6 of the Anglo-Turkish declaration indirectly extends Britain's guarantee to Turkey to the Balkan Peninsula. As the Balkan Entente countries have always adhered to a policy of maintaining neutrality, the measures agreed upon by Britain and Turkey are irrelevant to them. Subsequently, the content of the Franco-Turkish mutual assistance declaration is the same as the Anglo-Turkish declaration, which is contrary to our original intentions. However, the determination of the Balkan Entente countries to maintain a policy of neutrality will not be affected and will instead be strengthened. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

### Germany Woos Bulgaria and Yugoslavia

(Berlin) German political figures expressed their delight at the news of Bulgarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Koseivanov's upcoming visit to Germany, believing that it shows Bulgaria's confidence in future political cooperation with Germany. Goering's mouthpiece, the National Zeitung, also expressed the same opinion. It stated that the Treaty of Neuilly, signed after the European War, caused Bulgaria to lose land and people. Bulgaria's suffering and sacrifice are similar to Germany's signing of the Treaty of Versailles. Germany should assist Bulgaria and Yugoslavia in promoting their cooperation, ensuring that relations between Germany and Yugoslavia and Germany and Bulgaria can be established.

### Slovak Associate Makes Pro-German Speech

Professor Tuka, the Slovak associate Manliheng, delivered a speech yesterday at the German "Western National Socialist Party Congress," declaring that if those who incite war plunge the world back into chaos, Slovak soldiers will fight alongside German troops. Tuka continued that Slovakia is satisfied under German protection, so in any case, it will always be on the same side as Germany. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 3rd)

### German Government Restricts Use of Raw Materials

(Berlin) The government recently issued a new order in accordance with the Four-Year Economic Plan, restricting the use of cotton and linen. They cannot be used to manufacture bedspreads, clothing, ties, curtains, etc., and should be replaced by artificial wool. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

### Bolivia Denies Uprising

Outside the capital of Bolivia, there were reports that an uprising had occurred within the country. The adjutant to the presidential palace recently denied this, stating that the entire country is peaceful and stable. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)

### Japanese Troops Invade Chaozhou Along the Railway Direct Advance Equals a Solitary Army Deep into Enemy Territory Chinese Troops Still Hold Key Strongholds Between Chaoshan

Unheaded Communication: Japanese troops invaded Chaoshan in three routes on the 21st. The left wing advanced from Chaoyang Dazhou, the right wing advanced from Chenghai Waisha Sijiwei, and the central route used naval and air forces to break through Mayukou, directly threatening Shantou City. In addition, more than 50 Japanese warships and more than 100 motorboats traveled along the coast and infiltrated through the tributaries of the Han River to attack Chao'an. As of the 26th, the left and right wings of the Japanese army made no progress. Those who landed at Dazhou were stranded at the foot of Donghu Bogong'ao Mountain and were controlled by the Chinese army and militia. Those who landed at the north and south mouths of Chenghai only gained a coastal foothold, covering the motorboat flotilla advancing up the tributaries of the Han River. However, when passing through Ouditing, Shangpeng, and Diqian, four or five motorboats were sunk by the Chinese army. Currently, the Japanese army is using waterways to transport troops to Anbu, Meixitou, and Pengzhousuo for landings, attacking the Chinese army positions in Anbu from two directions. On the 23rd, the Chinese army had recovered Meixitou, but unexpectedly, the Japanese army made a sudden advance through the waterway, landing at Longhu Jinshishi, and cavalry was discovered attacking south of Caitang City, Chao-Shantou Railway Jinshi Guanchao Station. The Chinese army in Anbu painfully abandoned Panlong Mountain and retreated to the guerrilla base in Sangpu. The north side of the mountain overlooks the Chao-Shantou Railway, and the south side faces the major villages of PaoTaishi, Guanbu, Xilu, and Sangyuan in Jieyang. South of the mountain is the Yujiao River, which can connect to Fuyang Fengxi and Jieyang Fengkou Quxi. Both banks of the river are fertile plains. The Chinese army is controlling the plains of the three counties of Chaozhou, Chenghai, and Jieyang, relying on Sangpu Mountain. However, the Japanese army, relying on its superior equipment, knowingly braved the threat from the Chinese army on the left and right sides and still risked advancing north. The Chinese army successively retreated along the railway to Wuyang Mountain near Fuyang. When the Japanese cavalry, the Mori unit (advancing north along the embankment road), came out of Meixitou Anbu, rushed straight from the front of the railway, and met with the Imai unit that landed at Longhu in Ganlin, Jinshishi, a great bloody battle broke out on the morning of the 26th. Corpses of men and horses filled both sides of the railway. The Japanese aircraft Okada unit bombed the rear of the Chinese army in Fuyang City in turn, dropping more than 300 bombs. The Chinese army had no choice but to abandon Wuyang Mountain and retreat to the Qingmao Mountain, a key point on the Baoan Jie Road. Although this place is not steep, it can still flank the railway line. The Japanese troops of Orita and Masaki also went up the West River on the 26th, landing on the opposite bank of Jishuitabao, one way forcing the attack on Chunchhenglou outside the South Gate of Chaoan, and the other way crossing Fengxi to prevent the Chinese army from Jieyang from rescuing Chaoan. The position was only three miles away from Chaoan City, and artillery fire was heard in Chao City at noon. The people of Chao City quickly left through the North Gate to Dengyun in Guihu, heading to Tiandong and Liuhuang in Fengshun. Most of the military and political organs moved into the mountains. At this time, a large force of the Chinese army had gathered in Jieyang. Outside the North Gate of Chaoan were Zhugai Mountain and Hulushan, where the Chinese army had pre-built solid positions, holding the Xiangzi Bridge waterway. Heavy troops were also gathered on Bijiashan and Fenghuangshan on the east bank of the Han River. The current situation is that the Japanese army's central breakthrough strategy seems to have succeeded on the surface, but it is actually equivalent to a solitary army penetrating deep into enemy territory. Jiaoshi Chaoyang on the opposite bank of Shantou, as well as Pengzhousuo and Ouding Township in the suburbs of Shantou, Sangpu Mountain and Qingmao Mountain beside the Chao-Shantou Railway, and Aotou Yinhu and Longdu to Bijiashan on the east bank of the Han River are all held by the Chinese army. The Japanese army is only directly advancing, fiercely attacking undefendable plains and river areas. The momentary changes are common in military affairs. The final success or failure still depends on the decisive battle on Sangpu Mountain.

### Chinese Troops Surround Japanese Forces in Jiangmen and Xinhui Deng Longguang Deploys Large-Scale Counterattack Large Chinese Army Advances Sharply Along the Highway

Shiqi Communication: It has been almost three months since the Japanese army occupied Jiangmen and Xinhui. Initially, they planned to penetrate deeply into Kaiping, spy on Heshan, and then attempt to bypass and invade Gaoming, flanking Zhaoqing and shaking the base of the Chinese army in Xijiang. However, several attempts to spy on Heshan were repelled by the Chinese army. Since the Japanese army's conspiracy failed, they had to hold on to Jiangxin and use aircraft and motorboats to disturb the villages in Xinhui, Kaiping, and Taishan. During this period, the Chinese army intercepted the Japanese army from fleeing inland and actively deployed a large-scale counterattack against Jiangxin. The person responsible for the military affairs of that area was the Commander of the 　 Army, Deng Longguang. Deng appointed Brigade Commander Deng Bohan as the commander of the counterattack against Jiangxin line. Deng Longguang's troops had been arriving at the front line in a steady stream. The New-He Highway's Duruan, Mulang, Jinggen, and Jiushe, the New-Kai Highway's Daze, Niuwan, Sanjiang, and Muzhou, and the area along the Jiang-Fo Highway were crowded with troops and high morale. Before June 15, the vanguard had reached the Dayao and Xiaomei Mountains, approaching the Japanese army step by step, making contact. The Jiang-Hui war, which had been silent for a long time, was about to unfold again.

Fierce Battles Near Jianghui for Days

According to the investigation, at about 9 a.m. on the 15th, three Japanese tanks and 50 to 60 puppet troops attempted to attack the Chinese army's Tangxia position. The Chinese army immediately engaged the Japanese army in fierce fighting. At about 10 a.m., four Japanese aircraft flew in to provide cover and strafed the Chinese army's position with machine guns. The Chinese army calmly responded without fear. Fighting until 3 p.m., the Japanese army could not withstand it and fled back to Jiangmen. A small part of the Chinese army pursued, seizing twelve boxes of bullets near Dongjing. In this battle, the Japanese army suffered more than 20 casualties. Also, at about 2 p.m. that afternoon, a certain platoon leader of Yang Regiment's 　 Battalion of the Chinese army led dozens of guerrillas to attack the Japanese army near Jiangmen. At about 3 p.m., they arrived at Duruan Xiangshan and discovered hundreds of Japanese troops. The Chinese army immediately dispersed and calmly attacked. In a panic, the Japanese army drove dozens of water buffalo to cover their advance. The guerrillas fired intensively, and the Japanese army collapsed again. In this battle, more than 20 Japanese soldiers and more than a dozen water buffalo were killed. At 9 a.m. on the 16th, the Japanese army again used three tanks and 200 to 300 infantry to attack Ganzhu'ao along the Jiang-Fo Highway and were defeated by the Chinese army. One Japanese tank was destroyed, 20 to 30 Japanese soldiers were killed, and countless Japanese weapons and ammunition were seized. On the same day, the Chinese army 　 Unit also destroyed two invading Japanese tanks in Jinggen. After suffering a disastrous defeat, the Japanese army sent a large number of plainclothes agents, along with tanks, from Jiangmen along the Jiang-He Highway to Tangxia at 11 a.m. The unit of the Chinese army fought bravely, fighting for several hours. When the Japanese army went deep, the Chinese army surrounded and annihilated them. Under the four-sided encirclement, the Japanese army's formation was disrupted, and they fled in panic. In this battle, the Chinese army again killed dozens of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army in Xinhui City also launched attacks on various lines of the Chinese army, but were all defeated. As for the Chinese army's attack troops, on the morning of the 16th, they attacked the Japanese army in Dayun Mountain (near the West Gate of Xinhui City), Qibang (East Gate of Huicheng), and Baisha (southwest of Jiangmen), killing and capturing many. Also, on the river surface from Jiujiang to Jiangmen, there were two Japanese warships frequently traveling back and forth. On the river surface of Ganzhushakou, there were also two Japanese shallow-water warships patrolling back and forth, but there was no abnormal movement. On the evening of the 17th, the Chinese army team in Xinhui County, after 6 p.m., while sending out forward sentry to guard the coast, suddenly discovered many Japanese boats cruising in the river. They were detected by the Chinese army team, so they remained calm and the Sanjiang water enemy annihilation team launched an attack on the Japanese boats in the dark. As a result, five Japanese boats were sunk. All the Japanese puppet troops fell into the water and none survived. After the Chinese army team completed its mission, it returned to the defense area that night without any losses. Also, the Japanese army in Jiangmen Town is now extremely impoverished, and their uniforms are tattered. They collected the yellow uniforms worn by the Chinese army on a certain day in Jianghui and turned them over to the Japanese army. Therefore, the uniforms currently worn by the Japanese army in Jiangmen are mostly the yellow uniforms of the Chinese army team. On the morning of the 19th, Deng's Chinese army fought fiercely with the Japanese army near Mulang on the Xin-He Highway, killing 60 to 70 Japanese soldiers and destroying a Japanese tank. At 5 p.m., they were still in a cannon battle on the Xin-He Road. That night at 9 p.m., the Chinese army guerrillas lurking in the near suburbs of Beijie responded to the Chinese army's counterattack against Jiangxin and attacked Beijie, killing a Japanese officer and more than ten Japanese soldiers. The guerrillas on the Baisha side also attacked Gangzhou Highway and also made gains. On the same day, the Chinese 　 Fang's new air force dispatched to bomb the Japanese positions. At about 8 a.m., a team flew to the Jiang (men) Hui (cheng) line to bomb, dropping multiple bombs in the suburbs of Huicheng, killing many Japanese soldiers, and then flew to the coast of Heshan for reconnaissance before returning to the team.

The Puppet Advance Army Has Been Defeated

In order to implement the poisonous trick of "using Chinese to control Chinese", the Japanese army specially recruited local ruffians and bandits in Shunde, Foshan, Jiangmen, and Xinhui, calling them the "Advance Army" to act as pioneers in plundering villages in various counties. However, the members of this puppet "Advance Army" are complex. They were originally outlaws in the area, usually intolerable to the villagers. They temporarily willingly served the Japanese side, aiming only to make a fortune and take the opportunity to burn and loot. A few days ago, when the Japanese army invaded Sanjiang Muzhou, they drove more than 400 of these puppet troops as the vanguard. At that time, the Chinese army team responded with guerrilla tactics. As a result of the fierce fighting, more than 100 puppet advance troops were annihilated, and more than 100 were captured. Among them, some drowned while swimming, and some were wounded. The Chinese army team escorted a large number of prisoners back to 　 overnight for interrogation. The Puppet Advance Army Battalion Commander Zhao Yanxuan (also known as Zhao Xizhuo, from Sanjiang Township), Puppet Chief of Staff Li Xinyong, and another puppet staff officer were all captured by the Chinese army team. Gu Dinghua, the administrative commissioner of the first district, greatly praised the bravery of the self-defense people and sent personnel to escort the prisoners to a certain place for personal interrogation before sending them to the Xijiang × military headquarters for investigation. Afterwards, the Japanese army still led the remnants of the puppet army to invade Sanjiang Muzhou several times, but they were still defeated by the Chinese army team in Niubikong and Niuguyi. Since then, there have been no traces of Japanese puppets in the Sanjiang Muzhou area. It can be seen that the Japanese army is exhausted and cannot fight a protracted war. Also, the Japanese army, which had been rushing into the inland rivers in the Siyi area, has been hiding and dared not come out for half a month since the Sanjiang Muzhou battle. However, a few Japanese shallow-water warships have been remotely shelling the villages in the Muzhou area, and the purpose is only to harass and is not a cause for concern. As for the transportation between Siyi and overseas, it can still proceed unimpeded.

Regular Chinese Troops Surround Jianghui

The regular Chinese army units on the Xin-Kai, Xin-He, and Jiang-Fo highways are now approaching Jiangmen Huicheng, and there are fierce battles at various stations on the three highways. The Chinese army on the Jiang-Fo Road has crossed Licun Shuanglong and reached the northern suburbs of Jiangmen. The Chinese army on the Xin-He Road has been in artillery battles with the Japanese army in Foziao in recent days. The villagers of Duruan and other townships have risen up to participate in the war, assisting the guerrillas, causing the Jiangmen Japanese army to be overwhelmed. As for the Chinese army on the Xin-Kai Road in Huicheng, they have been appearing between Shatidi Bridge and Xinkui recently, flanking the Japanese army. Shatidi Bridge is in the western suburbs of Huicheng and is close to the city. It can be seen that the Japanese army in Huicheng is already in an urn. Until the 21st, the Japanese army suddenly landed in Shantou, and the Japanese army in Guangzhou moved a lot. The Japanese army in Shunde and Xinhui was also transferred, and most of them went to Shantou to participate in the invasion. The Chinese army, knowing this situation, will take the opportunity to launch a general attack on Jiangxin, and it is expected that it can be recovered in one fell swoop.

### Japanese Army Forces Suzhou Residents to Make Slogans The So-Called Peaceful National Salvation Movement Completed

Suzhou Communication: The Japanese army stationed here recently ordered the puppet police station to complete the so-called peaceful national salvation movement within two weeks, extract ten absurd slogans, publish them in newspapers, and order residents to make and post them immediately. Those who fail to make them after the deadline will be charged as anti-Japanese elements.

### Northern Jiangsu Chinese Army Recovers Lianshui County Japanese Army Retreats Outside the South Gate

Xinghua Communication: A certain unit of the Northern Jiangsu Chinese Army Jia Division was ordered to counterattack Lianshui. On the 26th, it distributed its forces into three routes and set out in a encircling shape toward Lianshui. At night, it reached the outskirts of Lianshui City with a rapid march. The Japanese soldiers fought desperately and responded in a panic. The Chinese army followed one after another, launching cloud ladders and climbing the city walls. They immediately seized the city walls in the northeast and west and engaged the Japanese army in street battles and hand-to-hand combat. The Japanese puppet army initially resisted stubbornly, but then the Chinese army took advantage of the situation and poured in. The remaining Japanese puppets could not support themselves and fled out of the city. By the Huanghe Embankment outside Nandou, they held on to the danger. Lianshui County was recovered by the Chinese army at four o'clock that night. On the 27th, the Chinese army had increased its forces to surround the Japanese puppet army outside the South Gate. The Japanese army in Suqian Daomian sent aircraft to bomb in order to reinforce Lianshui, but their bombs mostly fell in the villages opposite the Lianshui River.

### The Husband's Carelessness and Weakness Are Obstacles to Love

Being bold and careful is the key to success in all endeavors. Although the love between husband and wife is an extremely ordinary thing, it cannot escape this principle. A careless husband is often ignorant of the subtle changes in the female physiology and psychology. Imagine how sad it is for a delicate and beautiful flower with dew to be ignored. Therefore, when a wife tosses and turns repeatedly and her husband still sleeps soundly, she may not say it, but she must regard him as a pig in her heart. How many pig-like husbands there are! This is the material for after-dinner conversations among ladies.

However, if a clumsy husband is healthy, then the ladies can train him. There are many real-life examples that the ladies can report. If a man has damaged his body due to early self-pollution, nocturnal emission, or early marriage and indulgence, then symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, and neurasthenia will be endless. Such a husband may be able to keenly observe the characteristics of his wife, but it is of no use. It is futile to train him. The wall of dung cannot be carved. The best method is to fundamentally treat it. According to world-renowned doctors and my own experience, endocrine replenishment therapy using reproductive glands is the most effective treatment. However, the surgical procedure for this method is quite difficult. Fortunately, today's medicine is flourishing, and the Austrian medical saint Staner and numerous medical experts around the world have spent more than 30 years of arduous experiments. They extracted reproductive gland hormones from robust animals and replicated them into a scientific preparation, namely the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Shengzhisu". It is an effective oral medicine with a simple method of administration, and its function is exactly the same as endocrine replenishment therapy. After taking it, it can produce essence, replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish life within one day and night. The above-mentioned symptoms can be completely cured.

Patient Mr. Gao Yifeng, 31 years old, from Guangzhou, (self-reported) had self-pollution and nocturnal emission when he was young, and had premature ejaculation and impotence after marriage. He had been married for five years and had not been able to have children. His wife was three years younger. They had intercourse about once or twice a month, but each time he could ejaculate at most half a minute or sometimes he could not even get an erection, so he felt extremely bored, and his wife also resented him! He came to me for treatment, and I instructed him to purchase a dozen "Shengzhisu" from Wuzhou or Zhongxi Pharmacy. Before he finished taking it, in just a month, his illness was completely cured! His younger brother had severe nocturnal emission, which led to brain weakness and insomnia, greatly hindering his studies. I instructed him to purchase "Ximituo's Seizing Essence Pills" and "Shengzhisu" to take at the same time. In a short time, he also fully recovered his perfect health. This is a recent fact that can be used to prove it.

### No Need to Worry About Shrunken Breasts

— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Why so worried with furrowed brows!

Difficult to confide your concerns to companions,

Know that today there is a miraculous medicine,

Self-purchase, self-treatment, what is there to fear?

Concealing illness: Is a common ailment among Chinese people, especially women, who are unwilling to speak of even the most ordinary ailments, let alone physiological changes or peculiarities. They would rather frown and fret inwardly, resulting in a curable illness becoming a lifelong regret! A happy family becomes chaotic, what suffering is this really for?

Know that the present age is the age of scientific omnipotence. Not to mention women's menstrual pain, amenorrhea, irregular periods, leucorrhea, frigidity, infertility, and uterine malformations. There are targeted treatments or special medicines that can cure them in a short period of time. Even previously overlooked—and considered most difficult and without remedy—shrunken breasts now have a very targeted medicine for women called "Germinal Essence" that can cure them radically. This medicine was developed by the former Austrian physiology master Dr. Stener, who accumulated over thirty years of painstaking experimentation, extracting the essence of the reproductive glands and ovaries from animals such as orangutans, macaques, seals, and female rabbits, and combining it with brain-boosting and blood-enriching components such as phosphorus and calcium from minerals and plants, prepared through scientific methods. Therefore, its efficacy is great. It has been proven by famous doctors in Europe and America to not only regulate menstruation, invigorate metabolism, and eliminate uterine diseases, but also to have a particularly effective effect on shrunken breasts. The main reason for shrunken breasts is the impaired function of the reproductive glands and ovaries. Now, by taking the reproductive gland ovary secretion preparation "Germinal Essence" for women, it is just like touching the belly of a pufferfish, which will naturally swell up immediately. It is said that this medicine has been sold in our country for seven years, and all women who have lost their beauty due to shrunken breasts, leading to marital discord, have achieved their wishes and are endlessly grateful after taking this medicine.

Beauty-loving women: Ladies with shrunken breasts. If you want to be a healthy and beautiful woman of the new era and do not want to be slaughtered by demons, then there is no need to frown and sigh! You only need to immediately purchase a few boxes of female "Germinal Essence" from any major pharmacy such as Wuzhou, Zhongfa, or Zhongxi and treat yourself at home. Then you can not only keep it secret but also achieve your wishes in a short period of time. Isn't this the best of both worlds?

### Seminal Emission Patients Are Like Being Possessed by a Bloodsucking Demon

— Venereal Disease Specialist Physician Zhan Nianceng

I really do not understand why people are more afraid of losing blood than seminal emission. In fact, according to medical experts' verification, one drop of semen is as precious as eighty drops of blood. One seminal emission is as dangerous as losing one pound of blood! Then losing blood is indeed terrible, but is this painless seminal emission not even more terrible! According to physiological research, semen is the secretion of the reproductive glands, including various secretions from the pituitary gland, thymus gland, kidney gland, and testicular gland. Part of this gland is stored in the seminal vesicles through the external ducts, controlled by the seminal gate, and the sexual nerves control its opening and closing, waiting for the role of reproduction. Another part directly seeps into the blood to irrigate the whole body, to operate the arousal of emotions, the adjustment of metabolism, the promotion of developmental functions, and the nourishment of various nerves. Therefore, the preciousness of the reproductive gland fluid is truly equal to the source of life.

We have repeatedly warned young people against masturbation and indulgence. Because this kind of activity not only consumes semen but also easily injures the nerves, causing the seminal gate to loosen and causing seminal emission. Seminal emission that is not treated is like being possessed by a demon, and symptoms such as brain decay and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation and impotence, incomplete development, sallow complexion and emaciation, and mental weariness will follow one after another. It is impossible for such people to use their brains, and it is not appropriate to exert themselves. The future is bleak, and nothing is accomplished. At the same time, in married life, the wife is dissatisfied, and the family is plunged into a miserable situation! To seek remedy, seminal emission must be radically cured. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Himitot's Semen-Consolidating Pills" is the most targeted and effective. After taking it, it can consolidate the seminal gate and calm the nerves. Seminal emission can be stopped immediately on the same night. If seminal emission has already caused the above symptoms, then take "Germinal Essence," a preparation of reproductive gland essence, to nourish the brain, kidneys, essence, blood, and nerves, promote development, and adjust metabolism. Continue to take it for half a month, and the above symptoms can be completely cured, and the body will be exceptionally healthy. If patients can come to this clinic for electrotherapy and injections, a cure can be guaranteed.

White Turbidity Forum

### Radical Cure for Chronic Gonorrhea

Symptoms of Chronic White Turbidity

There are many characteristics of chronic white turbidity, and reduced pain is one of them. Other changes occur more frequently, the poisonous atmosphere spreads, the disease becomes deeper, and treatment becomes more difficult. Without a clever and knowledgeable doctor using the most scientific methods for treatment, it is rare to achieve complete success. The number of patients with chronic gonorrhea is increasing every day, so when doctors tell gonorrhea patients that they have entered the chronic stage, it is like a prisoner hearing a sentence of life imprisonment. In fact, this is a misunderstanding. Generally, the transition from acute to chronic white turbidity must be due to the failure to thoroughly eradicate the acute gonorrhea. Often, in the two or three weeks after contracting the disease, the condition is mistreated or not treated at all, the pain gradually decreases, the pus gradually decreases, and the urine also changes from turbid to clear. All the symptoms of acute gonorrhea gradually disappear. In terms of pain relief, it is certainly a temporary physical pleasure for gonorrhea patients, but in reality, the internal hidden dangers are very deep.

New Policy for Radical Cure

Changing from painful but easy-to-cure acute gonorrhea to stubborn chronic gonorrhea, a new targeted treatment must be adopted, and the primary conditions are three. One is sterilization, the second is virus filtration, and the third is correction of the disease state. The ideal treatment that can meet these guidelines is the German Filtrate-Flush Electrotherapy, as well as the injection of German Heese Serum and the Jemin operation, which can quickly and radically cure it. All chronic gonorrhea prostatitis, cystitis, arthritis, orchitis, seminal vesiculitis, and urethral stricture can be radically cured within a limited period of time, and because Filtrate-Flush Electrotherapy can filter and remove gonorrhea toxins, it is especially effective for neuralgia caused by gonorrhea toxins.

Specialties

Also treats syphilis, buboes, chancres, and painless new method circumcision.

### Silver and Money Exchange Businesses Reopen Today; New Funds Transfer System Implemented; List of Custody Committee Members Announced; Funds Transfer Deposits Ready for Gradual Cash Withdrawal

In order to adjust the capital of the Shanghai same-trade businesses and supply the needs of industry and commerce, the silver and money exchange businesses have decided to handle the receiving and spending of same-trade funds transfer for each shop and bank, with a total amount of 50 million yuan in national currency, effective today. At the same time, it will begin circulating in the market. The funds transfer deposit in the preparatory treasury of each shop and bank will be exchanged for legal tender by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. The details are recorded below:

Issuing Checks

Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired from the Bank Joint Preparatory Committee that each shop and bank has provided property reserves (including main goods, company bonds and stocks with formal market prices in the Shanghai market, and real estate with rights and interests in the Shanghai Concession) to receive same-trade funds transfer from the Bank Preparatory Committee. Yesterday, the committee began distributing checkbooks to those shops and banks that have provided property reserves, and today, each shop and bank will be allowed to issue new funds transfer bills to fully circulate in the Shanghai market. The paying agency specified on the bills is the Bank Joint Preparatory Committee. At the same time, the Preparatory Committee announced the funds transfer interest rate and the funds transfer deposit interest rate.

Custody Committee Members

The property reserves provided by each shop and bank to receive same-trade funds transfer are handed over to the Custody Committee for safekeeping by the Bank Joint Preparatory Committee. The Custody Committee members are: Song Hanzhang, General Manager of the Bank of China; Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications; Qian Xinzhi, Manager of the Joint Savings Society of the Continental Bank, the Jin City Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and the China South Bank; Mr.枢民, Manager of the British HSBC Bank; Mr.何柏根司, Deputy Manager of the British Mercantile Bank; and Mark Kay, Manager of the American Citibank. As for the Valuation Committee, it is divided into Real Estate Shares, Securities and Stocks Shares, and Goods Shares. The committee members are experts hired by the Bank Preparatory Committee.

Exchanging for Legal Tender

The funds transfer deposits previously deposited by each bank and money exchange in the Bank Joint Preparatory Committee and the Money Exchange Joint Preparatory Treasury will be converted into legal tender by the Bank Preparatory Committee at 95 percent in twelve weeks for circulation. It is said that the total amount is 22 million yuan. Legal tender is supplied by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank. Therefore, the Shanghai financial market will not only increase the 50 million yuan in new funds transfer chips but also increase the 22 million yuan in legal tender chips. In addition, the Bank Preparatory Committee has sent letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Silver and Money Exchange Association, and other groups to recommend representatives to jointly organize the Funds Transfer Reserve Inspection Committee.

Increased Chips

Yesterday, the person in charge of the Bank Joint Preparatory Committee told a reporter from the New Voice News Agency that the balance of funds transfer deposits in the Bank Preparatory Committee of each shop and bank is about 22 million yuan, which has been converted into legal tender in full by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications starting today. At the same time, each shop and bank can provide considerable property to receive funds transfer head positions from the Preparatory Committee starting today. Both legal tender and funds transfer chips in the Shanghai market have increased. After this, the turnover of commercial funds will be more flexible.

Industry Request

The Pawnshop Association stated that it could not maintain its business due to the restrictions of the Ma Telegraph and telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting that the special accommodation policies for the industry be granted in accordance with the financial stability measures promulgated in August of the 26th year (1937). All members of the association, after having their single copied and notified to the silver industry by the Chamber of Commerce in advance, should be allowed to continue to be accommodated in accordance with the previous approval to meet the needs of the pawnshops.

Various Industries Reopen

Today is July 4th. The Shanghai silver and money exchange industries have completed their semi-annual settlement period and are allowed to reopen for business today. The preparatory treasury market, acceptance office, and exchange office to which they belong will also resume operations at the same time. As for the bean, rice, miscellaneous grains, and flour markets, they reopened yesterday. The securities, gold, and cloth industries will reopen today. However, after the Ministry of Finance's Ma Telegraph restricted deposits and withdrawals and the silver and money exchange industries implemented the new funds transfer system, the chips in the Shanghai market increased, and the entire financial market will become more stable after this.

### Northern District Becomes Japanese Military Zone

This picture shows the development of Japanese military affairs in the Shanghai area. According to witnesses, the new barracks are of a permanent nature, with walls made of bricks and roofs made of tin, capable of accommodating 50,000 to 60,000 troops (resembling concentration camps). In addition, there are buildings near Wusong, but outsiders are not allowed to go there. It is also heard that the Japanese are now planning to connect the Suzhou Creek and the Wusong River to move the important waterway transportation of the concession into the area controlled by the Japanese. (Translated from the Moody’s Review).

### Silver and Money Industries Implement Centralized Clearing of Bills; Money Treasury Participates Through Entrusted Agency; Time Changed for Convenience of Clearing

After the Silver and Money Industry Association decided to concentrate the clearing of bills starting from July 4th, the bank clearing house has compiled the clearing numbers for the money treasury and each member money exchange and has changed the clearing time and promulgated the clearing methods for convenience of clearing. The details are recorded below:

Centralized Clearing

Bank Joint Preparatory Committee Circular No. 153 regarding bills states: "Greetings. In accordance with Article 5 of the Bank's Agency Clearing Method, we have compiled the clearing numbers for the Money Industry Preparatory Treasury and each member money exchange to participate in clearing and included them in the clearing stamp affixed to the bills submitted by the Money Treasury and each shop for verification. This circular is hereby issued, along with a table of clearing numbers for the Money Treasury and each shop. Please check and take note."

Changed Time

The committee also Circular No. 152 regarding bills states: "Greetings. The Money Industry Preparatory Treasury will participate in the clearing of bills through entrusted agency starting from July 4th. In order to facilitate clearing, the daily clearing time of the committee will be changed to start at 3:30 PM starting from July 4th. The time for each shop and bank to collect bills from outside and the time for the committee to collect bills from fellow banks and foreign banks outside the scope of clearing will remain the same. This circular is hereby issued. Please check and take note."

Clearing Methods

The bank clearing house's regulations for the Money Treasury's entrusted agency clearing are designated as Clearing No. 50 (Quan). Each money exchange entrusts a bank to collect bank bills, which will be concentrated in the Money Industry Preparatory Treasury in the future, opening both legal tender and funds transfer accounts and fully entrusting the Money Treasury to handle them. The clearing of bills among money exchanges will still be carried out by the Money Industry Clearing House itself, stipulated to start at 1:00 PM every day. This centralized bill clearing method is one of the sound financial organizations and will have great benefits in the future.

Clearing Numbers

Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired from the bill clearing house. The table of clearing numbers for the Money Industry participating in clearing is as follows: No. 50 (Quan) 1. Dade, 2. Dalai, 4. Yuansheng, 5. Wufeng, 6. Renchang, 8. Shenyuan, 11. Ankang, 12. Anyu, 13. Cunde, 15. Tongrun, 17. Tongyu, 18. Zhiyu, 20. Junchang, 21. Jintai, 22. Huichang, 23. Chengyu, 24. Yida, 25. Hefeng, 26. Xinfu, 28. Xinyu, 34. Chunyuan, 35. Yida, 39. Zhixiang, 40. Zhentai, 43. Shuntai, 45. Huifeng, 47. Yichang, 51. Fukang, 52. Fuyuan, 54. Gengyu, 55. Jukang, 58. Zikang, 59. Zifeng, 60. Qingda, 61. Qingcheng, 62. Dingkang, 64. Weixiang, 65. Hengjiu, 66. Hengtong, 68. Hongsheng, 71. Baofeng, 76. Jianchang.

### After Lowering the Value of Foreign Exchange, Import Trade Plummets; Value of Foreign Goods Increases - Merchants Telegraph to Return Goods; Japanese Merchants Refuse to Accept Funds Transfers - Resisting Goods is More Effective; The Goal of Lowering Foreign Exchange Has Been Achieved

According to a Shanghai dispatch in the French-language Peiping Political News, since the legal tender was lowered to six and a half pence, some import merchants in Shanghai have telegraphed abroad to cancel their contracts to purchase foreign goods, and a few merchants have refused to pick up foreign goods that have arrived in Shanghai. As a result, import trade has greatly decreased. Recently, with the restrictions on bank withdrawals, the number of people purchasing foreign goods has declined even further, because foreign merchants have always refused to accept funds transfers. However, some foreign firms are willing to accept funds transfers as a form of payment for the sake of doing business, but they slightly increase the price of their goods because funds transfer bills can still be discounted on the market to exchange for legal tender. Therefore, the value of foreign goods has risen significantly due to the sharp decline in foreign exchange and the high premiums. Chinese domestic goods have also risen accordingly, which has created the current phenomenon of rising living standards in Shanghai. However, from the government's perspective, its goal of restricting the import of foreign goods can be said to have been achieved, especially for resisting Japanese goods, which has been even more effective because Japanese merchants have always refused to accept funds transfers.

### Public Concession Strictly Prohibits Assemblies

According to the news agency, in order to maintain security within the Concession as the July 7th Anniversary approaches, the Public Concession Police Department, in addition to searching pedestrians on key roads and taking strict precautions, will strictly prohibit any assemblies from being held from today until the 10th.

### Japanese Build Airfield in Dinghai; Chinese Army Resolves to Destroy It; Hundreds of Japanese Troops Invade Guanyin Ao; Retreat After Being Fiercely Attacked by Chinese Garrison

Since the Japanese troops landed in Dinghai on the 23rd of last month, fierce guerrilla warfare is still ongoing. The Japanese side is building an airfield in Daxiao Field in an attempt to occupy it for a long time. Since the authorities strengthened the blockade of Wenzhou and Ningbo, the local situation has been extremely peaceful. Japanese puppet troops attempted to land at Guanyin Ao in Fuzhou a few days ago but retreated after being fiercely attacked by the Chinese army. The Moufu ship anchored outside the blockade line of Ningbo completed unloading last night and is scheduled to return to Shanghai tomorrow. Rumors that the ship was detained by Japanese warships are inaccurate. The details are as follows:

Japanese Build Airfield in Dinghai

The Japanese Navy landed at Shenjiamen and Dinghai Dadao in the Zhoushan Islands on the 23rd of last month. After fierce resistance from the Chinese army, they immediately abandoned the county seat and retreated to the Qingling area to continue fighting because there was no danger to defend. Fierce guerrilla warfare has been launched for days, making the Japanese troops exhausted. According to a reporter from the Daguan News Agency inquiring from the shipping industry yesterday, after occupying the county seat, the Japanese troops are rushing to build an airfield in Daxiao Field, forcing local coolie civilians to serve as laborers. Their intention is obviously to occupy it for a long time, but it is learned that the Chinese army is determined to take the opportunity to launch a surprise attack and carry out forceful destruction.

The Situation in Wenzhou and Ningbo is Peaceful

After the Chinese military authorities ordered the blockade of traffic at Zhenhai Port in Ningbo and Ou River Port in Wenzhou and deployed defensive works, defense has been strengthened. All foreign merchant ships sailing on these routes, such as De Ping, Ende, Kang Shayi, Haifu, Baoli, Hana, Liangzhou, Luzhou, Suzhou, Ganzhou, Yingzhou, and Feikang, have been suspended. Taikoo ships have changed course to Hong Kong. Although Japanese warships are patrolling the Zhejiang Sea, the situation in Shanghai and Ningbo is still as peaceful as ever. All urban residents have been evacuated to the countryside one after another.

### Chinese Guerrillas Attack Yantai Customs; News Arrives Late in Shanghai Due to Japanese Inspection; Pass Through Japanese Defense Lines Safely; Take Away Many Rifles and Bullets

According to the Continental News, on the night of June 21st, a team of Chinese guerrillas boldly attacked the Japanese-controlled Yantai Customs under cover of darkness. This delayed news was received in Shanghai yesterday (2nd) from reliable sources in Yantai. The news was delayed because the Japanese strictly inspected all news coming out of the city. The attack was not discovered until the customs officials returned to work the next morning and saw the watchman bound and his mouth gagged. After investigation, it was found that the attackers had searched the entire building, especially the armory.

Search Especially Detailed

Ten rifles and many rounds of ammunition were taken away. When the watchman was interrogated by the Japanese gendarmerie investigating the case, he claimed that the guerrillas numbered ten to twenty, each armed, and rushed into a room, bound him, and gagged his mouth before searching the entire building. According to the Japanese interrogation, the guerrillas departed from their nearby mountain headquarters on the night of the attack, sneaked through the Japanese lines, and cautiously passed through the supposedly defended streets.

Go Straight to the Beach

Near midnight, they reached their destination, searched all the rooms of the customs building, spent more than an hour, and safely withdrew before dawn. After the Japanese discovered the attack, they thoroughly searched the city for the daring attackers but only captured a few innocent residents, who were soon released. Two days after the attack, the Japanese-backed municipal government held an anti-British demonstration, forcing schoolchildren and hiring hundreds of coolies to participate.

Parade Through the Streets

At the same time, the puppet regime posted slogans with anti-British slogans on road intersections and billboards, forcing the marchers to carry cloth flags with words criticizing Britain and the British. However, the march itself was a failure because the participants did not seem very enthusiastic. For fear of possible violence against the British, the British ships Birmingham and Duncan berthed in Yantai on the same day. It was not certain here yesterday whether the two ships were still berthed there.

### Formalities for Filling Vacancies for Executive and Supervisory Committee Members of the Paint Industry; Replacements Should Be Made According to the Order of Alternate Committee Members; No Need to Go Through Assembly Formalities

The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Western Paint Industry Association asking whether an assembly or executive and supervisory meeting should be convened to fill vacancies for executive and supervisory committee members who have lost their representative qualifications due to closed shops, resignation, or death, or whether replacements should be made in order from the alternate committee members. The Chamber of Commerce immediately replied, "According to Article 2 of the Provisional Measures for Maintaining the Status Quo of Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Groups during the Extraordinary Period, only the re-election of officials is postponed. There are no restrictions on filling committee vacancies in the provisional measures. Executive and supervisory meetings can still be held to make replacements from the alternate committee members in accordance with the law. The members' assembly should not be convened because Article 2 of the provisional measures clearly stipulates a postponement, and it is impossible to violate the order to convene it. Moreover, the order of the alternate committee members for filling vacancies can be verified from the results of the 25th year (1936) re-election. It only needs to be handled according to the verification and does not need to go through the formalities of the members' assembly."

### Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods: Implementation Issues at the Jianghai Customs House. The Inspector General of Customs Instructs All Customs Houses to Comply. The Shanghai Customs Commissioner States That Implementation is Difficult. The Prohibition of Goods for Re-Export Can Reduce Imports.

In order to maintain the balance of international payments, reduce trade deficits, and promote exports, the Ministry of Finance has promulgated measures for prohibiting the import of goods during this extraordinary period, as well as measures for the settlement of exchange and receipt of exchange rate differences for exported goods. The Inspector General of Customs, Mr. Maze, was ordered to forward these instructions to all customs houses for compliance. The details are recorded as follows:

Implementation of Prohibited Import Goods

The measures for prohibiting import goods cover a total of eighteen groups and two hundred and thirty-four tariff items. Upon investigation of customs import goods, there are a total of thirty-two groups and four hundred and eighty-three tariff items. The prohibited goods now account for half of the import goods. These prohibited goods include foreign wines, white sugar, canned foods, meat dishes, vegetables, as well as luxury fur goods, cotton goods, timber, paper, bamboo and wood, rattan ware, stone products, and liquid fuels for which substitutes can be found. Since the ban was issued, re-export is also prohibited. However, if needed to adjust market prices in the rear areas, for special purposes, or for other legitimate reasons, and approved by government agencies, the Ministry may, after considering the actual needs, issue special purchase and transportation permits.

Implementation Difficulties in Occupied Customs Houses

A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from customs officials yesterday that Inspector General Maze, after receiving the order from the Ministry of Finance, has instructed all customs houses nationwide to comply. Regarding customs houses in occupied areas, such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Hankou, Kowloon, and North China's Tianjin, Yantai, Jiaozhou, Qinhuangdao, Weihaiwei, Longkou, etc., implementation may be difficult due to the fact that these locations have already fallen under occupation. As for the Jianghai Customs House in Shanghai, Customs Commissioner Mr. Lowford is said to have reported the difficulties in implementation to the Inspector General. As for customs houses in non-occupied areas, such as Mengzi, Simao, Tengyue, etc., they will comply with the Inspector General's order and implement it immediately.

Shanghai and Tianjin Become Import Surplus Customs Houses

Regarding the difficulty of eliminating import surpluses in customs houses in occupied areas, where government authority does not extend, from January to April this year, the import surpluses of customs houses in occupied areas were: (1) Shanghai Customs 72,316,000 yuan; (2) Tianjin Customs 74,300,700 yuan; (3) Jiaozhou Customs 14,951,000 yuan; (4) Yantai Customs 5,000,090 yuan; (5) Qinhuangdao Customs 2,886,000 yuan; (6) Xiamen Customs 1,838,000 yuan. The total import surplus of the above customs houses is approximately 171,300,700 yuan. The imported goods are mainly luxury goods, with Japanese goods accounting for the largest proportion. Since the government has ordered the prohibition of imports and the prohibition of re-export, the import volume of these non-essential goods is bound to gradually decrease.

Promoting Exports to Replenish Foreign Exchange

As for the import of essential goods, those specially approved by the government will continue to be supplied with the official exchange rate of one shilling and two and a half pence by the Central Bank. The Central Bank will continue to process applications from various industries every week as usual. In addition, in order to promote the export of domestic goods and replenish foreign exchange reserves, the Ministry of Finance requires that foreign exchange be settled with the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications for the export of major domestic goods. It also stipulates measures for the settlement of exchange and receipt of exchange rate differences for exported goods. Except for tung oil, tea, bristles, and minerals, which are related to barter for debt repayment and material storage and should be purchased by government trading agencies, merchants are allowed to freely trade other goods and receive exchange rate differences.

### Guerrilla Officers Heroically Sacrificed After Being Betrayed by Spies in Fengjing

It is rumored that three guerrilla officers from the suburbs of Songjiang, Jin Deming, Jin Xiaoxian, and Jin Lixian, were suddenly contacted by Japanese spies in Zhuqiao Town, and the three were captured by the Japanese army. They were taken to Fengjing and killed, heroically sacrificing their lives.

### Armored Vehicles of the Police Department Strictly Patrol Western Shanghai Providing Cover for Uniformed Police Officers. Shooting Incident in Zhuanhong Lane Causes Disturbance.

Details of the shooting incident in Zhuanhong Lane on Yidingpan Road in Western Shanghai were reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to the "China Press", there are slight differences between their report and ours. The translated version is as follows: Yesterday (2nd) afternoon, a search team from the Public Concession Police Department, consisting of one Western and three Chinese officers, was searching pedestrians on Yidingpan Road. They saw six suspicious Chinese men emerge from Zhuanhong Lane on the west side of the road and attempted to search them. The six men fled across the road and entered a lane, where they received assistance from other thugs and opened fire on the search team,

Firing Shots

About twenty shots were fired. The search team, unwilling to injure innocent pedestrians, took refuge in a rice shop and a pawnshop on the east side of Yidingpan Road and reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station by telephone. This was at 4:30 PM. Ten minutes later, a large number of armed police officers arrived. The thugs then fled into the lane. Police officers were unable to pursue them because the area was not within their jurisdiction. A large number of armed police officers remained at the scene for about half an hour before leaving, without finding any shell casings, because the thugs had

Picked up All the Shells

Before fleeing. District Police Chief Smith and Assistant Police Chief Samson also arrived at the scene and then returned to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. The Police Department has lodged a strong protest with the responsible officers of the Japanese Military Police in the area and has convened a meeting of Japanese Military Police officers and senior Police Department officers scheduled for 9:30 AM today (3rd). Two armored cars of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps were ordered to patrol the area along Yidingpan Road, carrying Shanghai Volunteer Corps

Machine Gun Teams

Two members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, as well as two Western police officers, each equipped with a portable machine gun. The reason these two military vehicles were dispatched for service is that uniformed police officers can obtain necessary cover. If they walk, ride horses, or bicycles, they are easily targeted by gunfire, while the thugs are dressed in plain clothes and can easily hide among pedestrians. Although many believe that the Police Department knows which organization is involved in yesterday's attack, no information has been obtained on this matter. Some sources believe that these thugs are protecting

Gambling Dens in the Area

Many believe that in view of the recent series of shootings in the area, which endanger the lives of residents of the Public Concession, the Police Department should take a strong stance in this morning's meeting and request the "Dadao" authorities to carefully guard all alleys connecting to the roads of the Public Concession to prevent armed individuals from leaving the "Dadao" area.

### Increased Security in Wusong Ferry Services Suspended

The ferry services from the concessions to Wusong have been suspended since the 3rd. The ferry across the river from Gaoqiao to Wusong is also closed. Therefore, those traveling between the concessions and Wusong are experiencing difficulties and must detour through Zhabei. The inspections along the way are very strict. It is rumored that rumors have been rife in the Wusong area for days and security is tight. The Japanese army frequently conducts searches of residents' homes, and residents dare not go out, creating a sense of panic.

### Dr. Bader Said: A Patient is Not Just a Body of Flesh and Blood: An Interview with the Director of Renji Hospital (Part Two)

— E.L.

"How to manage a hospital to maximize its efficiency?" This was the second question I hoped Director Bader could answer for me.

"Personally," Dr. Bader replied, "First, I want to clearly understand all the matters."

Then he added, "It's not that I have to participate in everything myself, but I must know the progress of everything related." This is very clear, because he is at the top of the whole situation, and of course, he must maintain a very keen sense.

From the issue of personnel and business management, I asked Dr. Bader about the "manpower" of Renji Hospital.

He said that the total number of staff in the entire hospital, including nurses, is 285. There are four foreign doctors, ten Chinese resident doctors, and five non-resident doctors. There are 150 nurses, including students from the nursing school. In addition, there are several honorary consultant doctors and doctors from the Lester Institute of Pathology.

Q: "Is the current 'strength' of doctors sufficient to cope with the huge number of patients?"

A: "As far as medical services are concerned, there is no urgent need for more doctors." I then asked, "Isn't it troublesome to manage the team?"

Dr. Bader stood up from his chair, walked to the wall, and pointed out a large form pinned on the wall. This form was as large as the "emergency notice" posted on the road by the Public Works Department, with many grids dividing it, filled with the dates of the week and the surnames of many doctors.

Dr. Bader said modestly that this was one of his tasks, that he wanted to enable every doctor to handle their work happily and without worries; at the same time, if necessary, he could transfer them at any time to achieve a well-managed effect.

From where I was sitting, I could clearly see the hospital gate and the yard inside the iron gate. At this time, a white ambulance was parked there. I immediately thought of many unfortunate events in society, such as suicide, feuds, gunshots, and accidental dangers. Seventy or eighty percent of the injured or victims are sent to Renji Hospital. The gatekeeper, regardless of the weather, the cold or warm seasons, or the time of day, would naturally open the door upon seeing the car; after the patient in the car was unloaded, the gatekeeper would open the door again, seemingly without feeling, preparing to serve again when the second accident occurred. Twenty-four hours a day, seven hundred and twenty hours a month... coming and going countless times, doing very loyal transportation work for the "emergency room."

"Is the work in the emergency room very troublesome?" I asked.

"Yes," Dr. Bader said, "Compared to other things, most of the patients with various accidents, such as suicide, vehicle accidents, etc., are sent here to receive emergency treatment."

"Then there must be a doctor on duty all day long."

"There are always resident doctors waiting, day and night, usually one chief physician and three assistant physicians; because emergency often requires surgery; and when a doctor is working, it is difficult to ensure that a second new event will not happen," Dr. Bader replied.

According to the Renji Hospital Annual Report for 1938, the service statistics for the emergency room last year are as follows: 1,840 vehicle accidents; 2,983 various fights; 261 gunshot and bomb injuries; 4,554 accidental dangers such as burns, falls, and machine injuries; 4,755 internal and surgical emergencies; 974 attempted suicides, 464 arriving at the hospital already dead; the above totals 15,832 cases, an average of 44 cases per day.

We talked about the handling of patients from unfortunate events in society, and the atmosphere became a little serious.

"How can we reduce the pain of patients and make them recover easily?"

Dr. Bader believes that this question is worth discussing and has a lot of room for development. I will summarize the essence of his reply as follows.

He said that most of the patients admitted to Renji Hospital are from the middle and lower classes, and the living conditions of these people are mostly below the standard. If a person is unfortunately ill, the physical pain is aside; but the mental worries must not be ignored. Especially among the poor, the suffering of these patients is truly unimaginable.

"For example," Dr. Bader continued, "a patient who has broken his leg, in addition to the pain he suffers, has many worries in his heart: he is afraid of losing his job due to disability, and therefore, in addition to the physical pain, he must also worry about his family, his wife and children!"

"Therefore, in addition to treating the physical pain, we must also find ways to comfort him mentally," Dr. Bader said solemnly when mentioning the "social service" spirit of the "Women's Relief Association" in his hospital.

### Japanese Military Police Officer Arrested by British Soldiers. Released After Misunderstanding is Explained. Jewish Refugee Children Prevented From Entering Summer Camp.

According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury", on Saturday afternoon, pedestrians passing through the obstacle on Great West Road saw a noisy crowd and slight disturbances. Eventually, a Japanese military police officer in plain clothes was arrested by British soldiers, and a group of Jewish refugee children was prevented from going to the summer camp prepared for them. Both matters have now been resolved. The cause was a misunderstanding. The travel permits of fifty refugee children issued by the Japanese Consulate had not been signed by the Japanese army controlling the Hongqiao area, so they were prevented

From Entering.

At the time, two Japanese military police officers were traveling towards Hongqiao in rickshaws. When they reached the obstacle, the rickshaws stopped on the side of the road in the British military zone. One military police officer walked to the Japanese military headquarters on Lincoln Avenue, while the other plainclothes military police officer stood and chatted with the Japanese sentry. Shortly after, the military police officer who went to the headquarters returned. The plainclothes military police officer then went to the road, stood in front of the British sentry, and called for a rickshaw. The British sentry asked him to move because he was obstructing traffic. The Japanese soldier

Ignored the Request.

A British sergeant approached and spoke to him, but because the Japanese soldier paid no attention to him, he slightly tapped him on the shoulder. The military police officer became angry and turned around to hit the British sergeant in the chest. The British guards immediately arrested him. After confirming the soldier's name an hour and a half later, he was released. As for the Jewish refugee children, they were greatly disappointed and had to be taken back. However, permission has now been obtained from the Japanese army, and the camps can be opened as originally planned.

### American Residents Celebrate Independence Day. Traditional Celebrations Held as Usual.

Today is American Independence Day. The American Consulate is closed for the holiday. The American residents of this city are holding traditional celebrations as usual. A flag-raising ceremony will be held at the American School at 10 Peitang Road at 9:00 AM this morning. Commander Fegan, a Navy Captain, will make a brief congratulatory speech. American Consul Gauss will distribute flags to American children present. At 12:30 PM, the American Consul will host a banquet at the Xiejiao General Assembly Hall to formally entertain guests. Members of the American General Assembly and guests will hold a luncheon at the American Club on Fuzhou Road. American warships in the Huangpu River will also fly flags to celebrate. In the evening, there will be a grand musical performance. A baseball game will be held at the racecourse stadium at 5:00 PM to compete for the trophy. Post offices across the region will also sell commemorative stamps to celebrate. However, whether the American School venue can be used today due to rain will be determined at the last minute.

### Rice Market Opened Yesterday Rice Prices Continue to Fall

After the price of rice in the Shanghai market was fixed at a maximum of 21 yuan for white rice, the rice market, which had been tense for a time, gradually calmed down. However, because manipulators deliberately did not offer high-grade japonica rice for inspection, all rice transactions were for medium and lower grades. Although it has been raining continuously in recent days, sources from various places continue to arrive in an endless stream, and the stock is abundant. Yesterday,

Sources From Downriver Were Strongest

With the Nanhang gang being the most numerous. A total of more than 4,000 bags were transported to Shanghai by both land and water. The rice market was closed for two days from July 1st due to the settlement of accounts by the silver industry. Yesterday (3rd), it reopened as usual. The wooden streets were not smooth, and most of the hoarders also stopped buying, causing the market to soften.

Market Prices Fell Back

By 10 to 20 cents. About 4,000 bags were traded in the morning market. According to a leader in the rice industry yesterday, Shanghai's dense population and increased number of citizens mean that

Daily Rice Demand

Is about 10,000 bags. At this time of year, when the new crop is not yet available, the rice-producing areas in the interior, such as Wuhu, Changshu, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, etc., are all seeing a reduction in their stockpiles. Farmers are taking advantage of this to raise prices, and general traders are not actively purchasing because they have no profit to make. Moreover, Wuxi and other places still strictly prohibit grain from leaving the territory, so the recent

Reduction in Sources

Is due to this reason. However, Shanghai's stocks are abundant, and there is no need to worry about food for the people. However, the fluctuating market prices are causing much hardship for ordinary people. Fortunately, standard prices have also been set for medium and lower grades of rice. As for the 14th survey of rice stocks in rice warehouses, it could not be organized due to the two-day market closure and will have to be postponed until today or tomorrow.

### Shaoxing Compatriot Association Solicits Opening of the General Assembly

The Shaoxing Seven Counties Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, in response to the needs of the actual situation, is holding its eighth membership solicitation campaign. Preparations have been underway for quite some time. Yesterday (July 1st) was the opening day of the association. At 2:00 PM, the opening ceremony was held in the assembly hall of the association on Aierjin Road, North Shanxi Road. A total of more than 200 people attended, including Captains Pei Yunqing and Hu Chunxiang, Deputy Chiefs of Staff Wang Juru and Huang Yuzhai, Team Leaders Shou Xiaotian, Yan Dayou, Wang Miaoda, Cen Zhiliang, He Wuliang, Feng Meixue, etc. During the meeting, Pei Yunqing, Huang Erzhai, Cen Zhiliang, and others gave speeches, with many words of warning. This was followed by a discussion of important proposals such as the membership solicitation target method and the improvement of association affairs, which lasted for three hours before adjourning. After the meeting, the number of points pre-subscribed and already paid by the team leaders reached more than 6,000, setting a new record for the association's previous membership solicitation conferences.

### Large Japanese Fortress Built Near Tiantong'an

According to a person from Zhabei, north of the railway near the Japanese Naval Headquarters in Tiantong'an, the Japanese are employing a large number of laborers to build a large fortress, about 22-33 feet high and about 10 feet wide, on which machine guns can be mounted to prevent guerrilla activities. It is also reported that similar fortresses will be built in other important locations. The bricks and stones used are all being transported from the Zhabei railway station.

### Continuous Heavy Rain in This City for Days Stagnant Water Forms Canals, Affecting the Market Rainfall Reaches 1824.1 mm, or 4.89 Inches

Since 0:00 on the 1st, there have been showers and torrential rains in this city. The rain only stopped at 2:30 PM yesterday, but the weather has not yet become refreshing. According to a report from the Datong News Agency from the Xujiahui Observatory, the heavy rain in Shanghai started at 0:00 on the 1st and only stopped at 2:00 PM yesterday, with a total rainfall of 1824.1 mm, or about 4.89 inches. Therefore, the rainfall was extremely heavy, with the sound of rushing water constantly. The rain was interrupted for only a few short moments. Yesterday's rain was especially heavy from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM, with a rainfall of 40.8 mm, or about 1.61 inches. As a result, all roads were flooded, with water depths ranging from several inches to more than a foot. Areas with standing water include Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, Yinhua Street, Alabastard Road, Jiangxi Road, and Marong Road, Sapo Sai Road, Popp Road, Guba Road, etc. In these areas, vehicles passed as if sailing on land, splashing waves, and pedestrians had to wade through the water barefoot. Those dressed in smart attire could only rely on rickshaws to ferry them across. The number of pedestrians in the rain yesterday was significantly reduced, and business in stores was greatly affected. Shops with standing water in front of their doors were even more deserted. Although the rain stopped after 2:00 PM and the sun shone briefly, it quickly became overcast again. According to reports, the weather in the Yangtze River basin has turned sunny since yesterday, so there is hope that the weather in Shanghai will also clear up. However, it is currently the plum rain season, and weather changes are unpredictable, so it is difficult to predict whether it will clear up.

Heavy Flooding Blocks the Badlands of Western Shanghai

According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury", the Xinkang Lane next to Bailinan Road in the badlands of western Shanghai, the center of second-class opium dens and gambling dens, was flooded with three feet of water today (3rd), effectively cutting it off from the outside world. In the past few days, excessive rainfall has caused several sections of Jessfield Road to be two feet deep in water. Xinkang Lane was already two feet deep in water yesterday (2nd), greatly impacting addicts and gamblers. Opium dens and gambling dens immediately erected temporary "floating bridges" to facilitate customers. Due to the heavy rain that continued yesterday and this morning, the water continued to rise, and the "floating bridges" were completely submerged in the water this morning, preventing many addicts from entering the opium dens to get their fix this morning. The opium dens in the area have been more severely affected by the flooding than the gambling dens. They recently closed and went on strike to protest the "Reformed Government" and the "Shanghai Anti-Opium Bureau" for collecting higher taxes, resulting in losses. They only resumed business a few days ago and are now forced to suspend operations, at least temporarily, due to the flood.

Standing Water Forms Canals in Low-Lying Areas

Several sections of Jessfield Road are flooded, with water forming canals up to two feet deep. In lower spots, there are pools of water. The water in front of the Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade on Yuyuan Road is one and a half feet deep, but the fire trucks have not been submerged because the ground has been raised in recent months. Car garages are quite busy today, as car parts cannot move freely due to the humidity. However, the engines of public buses have not been affected. Several places in the French Concession are flooded. At noon, the intersection of Nanjing Road and Guizhou Road had become a swamp. The water accumulation at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Matheson Road was especially deep. Stores used planks and other materials to prevent water from flowing in. Further west, near Hartung Road and Hede Road, there was also a vast expanse of water, causing great inconvenience to residents.

Today the Battlefield is a Vast Expanse of Water

In recent days, this city has experienced continuous heavy rain, day and night. At times, there were torrential showers, and at other times, there were intermittent drizzles. As a result, the rooms were very humid and stuffy. Objects were moldy. At around 12:00 yesterday, a gentleman braved the rain to Zhabei, passing through Xin Zha Bridge, Datong Road, and Zhongxing Road. He saw that pedestrians had disappeared everywhere, and the roads were deserted. The rubble piles along both sides of the road were covered with green grass, and the scorched earth was no longer visible in some places. The wasteland along the Jiaotong Road railway line to the Maigen Road station had become a vast expanse of water. The section of Zhongxing Road from west to the Dayang Bridge was full of puddles due to disrepair. Looking northeast towards the area between Zhonghua Xin Road, Pushan Road, Datong Road North, Zhijiang Temple Road, and Gonghe Xin Road, everything had turned into a water-covered grassland. The tomb area behind the Wing On Company warehouse on Zhongxing Road was originally very low-lying, and standing water had formed canals. However, the green grass was several feet high, so the standing water could not be seen from a distance, only the green grass. There was a nunnery that was not destroyed at the intersection of Song Park Road, and there was a Japanese soldier sentry post at the corner. The Japanese soldiers were standing in the post with guns, conducting strict inspections, because the area was a garrison area. Then he went through Zhiyuan Road, Xiangshan Road, Yongxing Road, Huiwen Road, and Qiujiang Road, returned over the bridge on North Sichuan Road.

The French Police Department Strictly Prohibits Splashing Water

The continuous rain has not stopped, and the tide of the Huangpu River has also risen sharply, causing standing water in the low-lying areas of the concessions, and pedestrians are complaining. At the same time, in the water on the roadside, there are often mischievous children barefooted in the water, who take pleasure in splashing water on passing pedestrians. The passersby are indignant, but there is no way to reason with them, so they can only sigh helplessly. In view of this, the French Concession Police Department specially dispatched detectives in trucks to patrol the flooded roads yesterday in order to prohibit this behavior. Therefore, after the above situation occurred on Maitre Road yesterday, the detectives rushed to dissuade the children.

### Public Bus Catches Fire

At the intersection of Xinzha Road and Datong Road, at around 11:00 yesterday, a public bus No. 15032, operating on a certain route, caught fire due to excessive friction in the engine, which generated heat. Flames shot up from the front of the bus and the braking system. The passengers and ticket collectors in the bus hurriedly escaped. The police officers on duty arrived after hearing the news and summoned the fire brigade to come and help extinguish the fire. Only a portion of the front of the bus was burned, and the loss was minor.

### News from Singapore Road: Thugs Attack Car, Firing Several Shots that Miss; Silk Factory Manager Greatly Startled

Yesterday at 11:15 AM, a shooting at a black-plated car suddenly occurred on Singapore Road in West Shanghai. After the incident, the Public Concession Police Department immediately dispatched officers to the scene for investigation. It is understood that the black-plated car, number 3893, belongs to Li Mingzhi (from Ningbo), the manager of the Wanbao Silk Weaving Factory at number 53 on that road. Before the incident, Li, along with Liu Qingyi, an engineer from Wuxing at the factory, and Tao Youchuan, a friend of Li's and the manager of Wanlong Silk Store at number 4, Lane 244, Ningbo Road, left the factory, intending to go to the Wanbao Distribution Office at number 15, Lane 324 (also known as Xiangfen Lane) on Nanjing Road. Unexpectedly, after traveling only a few steps eastward, a man suddenly jumped out from the roadside, shouted for the car to stop, and fired a shot at the car. However, Li's driver was exceptionally alert and immediately accelerated forward. Seeing this, the man fired two more shots at the rear of the car and fled, but because the distance was too great, he missed. Afterwards, Li reported the situation to the Gordon Road Police Station. The case is currently under investigation to determine the truth.

### The So-Called Infant Relief Center: Stealing Under the Guise of Charity, Defrauding for Money, Boasting and Collecting Donations to Enrich Oneself; Wang Guangdao Sentenced to Five Years in Prison

A man from Chongming named Wang Guangdao, taking advantage of the opportunity after the outbreak of the Shanghai war, independently organized a so-called "Infant Relief Center" starting around January of last year. Its office was initially set up on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, and later temporarily located within a certain women's university. He widely distributed leaflets and falsely used the Dalae Radio Station to

Boast Extravagantly

claiming that since the outbreak of the war, displaced residents had been scattered and separated from their families, with orphaned children and infants seen everywhere in the streets. Because he could not bear to witness this, he organized the Infant Relief Center with the aim of taking in infants, but due to limited financial resources, he appealed to ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life to enthusiastically donate, and claimed to have famous people as sponsors. After this advertisement was published, people from all walks of life, being

Unaware of the True Situation

donated generously, totaling approximately five to six thousand yuan. However, Wang, apart from hiring one nurse and a clerk named Du Jiaju, did not make public any information about the donations or their use, and even moved the location to Room 519 of the Pudong Native Place Association on Avenue Edward VII. The matter came to the attention of the Public Concession Police Department, which considered Wang's behavior to be

Fraudulent Acquisition of Money Under the Guise of Charity.

The police department then ordered detective Cui Chengke to arrest Wang and the clerk Du Jiaju, and escorted them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the court continued the interrogation. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted them for embezzlement and fraud. After Judge Meng interrogated them clearly, he sentenced Wang Guangdao to five years in prison for continuous embezzlement of items held for public welfare, while Du Jiaju was released. The two children were sent to the Jiliang Institute for care.

### Plainclothes Japanese Inspect Hotels

Last night at 10 PM, three plainclothes Japanese individuals suddenly visited the Grand Shanghai Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, inspecting all parts of it. Then, they left the hotel in a car and went to Room 62 of the Southeast Hotel on Xizilaihuo Street for inspection. Because all the guests in that room were farmers from the countryside, they immediately left. However, both hotels were greatly startled.

### Japanese Man Hirose Stabbing Murder Case: Japanese Claim Principal Culprit Apprehended; Xia Ganquan Arrested

According to news agencies, Hirose Jinpei, a 45-year-old Japanese clerk at the No. 2 Factory of the Neiwaimian Mill on Rue Robert in West Shanghai, went out fishing at 5:30 AM on the 29th of last month. However, he never returned. After the Japanese side discovered his disappearance, they searched everywhere. Only the next day was his body found by a small riverbank in Gujiaku, Dachang. Upon examination, it was discovered that he had seven fatal wounds from a shovel. After the body was taken back and claimed by his family, the Military Police Corps, Marines, and the puppet "Police Bureau" investigated separately. The details have already been recorded in this newspaper. Now, according to a Japanese announcement, after a considerable investigation following the occurrence of the case, they have obtained clues, and claim that the two puppet bureaus arrested Xia Ganquan (age 21, residing at No. 3, Zhangjiazhai, Dalutong Road, Shanghai), who killed Hirose, at a noodle shop at No. 107, Rue Robert in West Shanghai at 4:40 PM on the 2nd. He is currently under strict interrogation.

### Second Special District Prison: Vigorously Streamlining the Prison; Currently Detaining 1,500 Inmates

The Jiangsu Second Special District Prison on Avenue Massenet in the French Concession has recently become overcrowded due to holding over 2,000 inmates. Therefore, it is vigorously implementing measures to streamline the prison, namely, earnestly implementing parole and bail measures, and adopting new measures of extraordinary parole and serving sentences outside of prison. For example, inmates sentenced to life imprisonment who have served 12 years of their sentence and have not violated prison regulations may be granted parole. Those with sentences of around 10 years who have served half of their sentence may also be granted parole. Those with sentences of less than 5 years who have served one year of their sentence will be granted extraordinary parole, and those with sentences of less than 3 years who have served 3 months of their sentence will be granted permission to serve their sentences outside of prison. It is understood that the prison's vigorous streamlining measures have yielded good results. There are now approximately 1,000 convicted inmates and approximately 400 to 500 unconvicted inmates, totaling no more than approximately 1,500.

When they checked Room 222, they saw three men and three women inside looking panicked, so they searched them. They confiscated a Ning-brand pistol with three bullets from the bed in the room and immediately

arrested the six men and women,

namely Hu Zhiyuan, Zhang Yingwei, and Yuan Zhengya, and the women Sun Huifang, Xu Meiling, and Jin Lingbao (Jin lived at No. 5, Songbaili, Li Mei Road). They were all brought back to the police station. After interrogation, they confessed that the pistol had been obtained from Yu Zhongyue at No. 48, Lane 478, Xinzha Road. The detectives then arrested Yu as well. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Tribunal of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi approved their detention for further interrogation at a later date.

Hu Zhiyuan confessed

that he was introduced by a friend and intended to work for Wang Jingwei, so he borrowed the pistol from Yu to go and join him. Yu Zhongyue confessed that when Hu Zhiyuan came to borrow the gun, he said that copper coins were extremely scarce in the market today, due to speculation by unscrupulous merchants, so he intended to use the gun to warn them, and that is why he lent it to him. After reviewing the confessions, Judge Xiao Fan ordered all the defendants to be returned to prison for further interrogation at a later date.

### Sleeping Outdoors, Suddenly Stabbed to Death

Zhang Gougou, a 28-year-old man from Tongzhou, lived in a straw shed at the old site of the stove room at No. 82, Xianchengfang, Lane 16, Rue Pére Robert in the French Concession, paying a monthly rent of one yuan. Zhang pulled a tiger cart at a slaughtering company, and as was his habit, he went to work at the company at 2:00 AM every day, returning home at 6:00 AM. Last night, because the weather was muggy and there were many people in the house, Zhang and two of his roommates used the tiger cart as a bed and slept next to the bamboo fence at the door. Suddenly, while they were snoring, a thug came and first stuffed Zhang's mouth with incense ash to prevent him from calling for help, then stabbed Zhang in the throat with a sharp blade. The murderer took the opportunity to escape. By the time the two roommates woke up, Zhang had already died. Someone reported it to the police station, who dispatched detectives to investigate.

Education News

### Zhejiang Local Education: Past Situation and Improvements (2): Guerrilla Areas Establish Senior and Junior High School Remedial Schools

4.  If each county uses all of its education funds to run primary schools and social education, it still feels insufficient. The social education funds have not yet reached the 20% standard set by the ministry. If secondary schools are established and funds are distributed, it will hinder the development of local education and have a huge impact. For example, the New Chang County High School’s funding accounts for 41% of the county’s education funding, while others are 30% or 20%, with the lowest being 9% for Pingyang County Middle School. If we look at the situation in countries with developed education, one middle school per county is not too many. However, in our country, where national education has not yet been popularized and education funding is so stretched, the establishment of county-level middle schools is not urgently needed. To raise cultural standards to adapt to the war of resistance and nation-building, not only should the establishment of county-level middle schools be restricted in the future, but schools that have already been established but have not achieved much should be merged into provincial middle schools to avoid the crude and mass production of middle school students and save money. Therefore, the establishment of county middle schools should be restricted to maximize the development of local primary education.

5.  If teachers and funding are reasonably resolved, and the county's education administrative structure is not sound, considerable results cannot be achieved. The Education Section of the county government is responsible for all education administrative matters in the county. The responsibility of the head of the Education Section is extremely heavy. However, since the change of the Education Bureau to the Education Section, the section chief often advances and retreats with the county chief. A county’s education plan changes when the person in charge changes its methods. Also, the office staff of the Education Section are often not suitable for the education business. Although the school directors and assistant school directors in the school district have their positions, they have no salary or only a meager allowance, and no office expenses, so they cannot fulfill their due duties. Therefore, adjusting the administrative structure is also an important step in developing local education.

The above is only about the general situation in the counties in the rear. If we talk about education in the guerrilla areas, there should be different developments. Education in the struggle for offense is actually an important task of offense. Moreover, some people in the occupied areas have implemented slave education to anesthetize our young students. We have no choice but to catch up quickly, to actively promote education work with an offensive posture. The original 40 mobile schools in the guerrilla areas should be greatly increased and vigorously restored to the original schools at all levels, and subsidized with their expenses. For the difficult children who have no food or clothing, set up a children's education and care garden to provide relief to them. Unemployed youth should be recruited as much as possible and trained. The teaching materials for schools at all levels should be printed and distributed by the province, and an education supervision office should be set up in the Zhejiang West Administrative Office to guide and inspect the facilities of schools at all levels. Its personnel should be directly dispatched by the Education Department, so that the education in the guerrilla areas can be developed and the Japanese slave education can be broken.

### B. Key Points for Improvement

In summary, I now propose ten points:

1.  The province should be divided into five normal school districts, each with a model school. The number of grades should be appropriately increased according to the needs of teachers in the counties in the model district. The senior high school normal school departments and simplified normal classes in the original provincial middle schools should be transferred to the normal schools for management.

2.  The principals of county-level primary schools in each county should be organized by the province to conduct centralized training in districts. The teachers of county-level primary school groups and the principals and teachers of district, township, private primary schools, short-term primary schools, and public schools should be trained in batches by the county in stages, and regulations should be established for teachers and staff in each level of school to continue their studies every semester.

3.  Normal school graduates should be assigned to serve in each county by the Education Department in a unified manner, with the same treatment. In poor counties, if the teachers' salaries cannot reach the prescribed standards, they should be subsidized by provincial funds.

4.  The treatment of primary school teachers in each county should be standardized according to qualifications, experience, and other standards, and the grade should be uniformly increased and implemented starting in the 29th year.

5.  The education funds of each county (excluding provincial allocations) should be stipulated to account for at least 25% of the total county funds. The funds for primary schools in each district, township should be supported by the district education funds production committee, or the district and township governments should increase the funds for private primary schools as much as possible. The board of directors should find ways to plan and follow central laws and regulations to protect their independence.

6.  The province and the county should jointly plan to develop new sources of revenue to increase education funds, and petition the central government to give the province and county a percentage of the income tax according to regulations to fully fund education.

7.  County-level middle schools in each county should be restricted or merged according to the education funding situation of each county and the operating conditions of each school.

8.  The head of the Education Section of the county should be filled by a qualified person and should not be replaced arbitrarily. The number of supervisors and staff should be determined according to the complexity of the education business in the county. The Education Department should separately stipulate the number of staff members. School directors and assistant school directors should stipulate salaries and office expenses, which should be paid from the county's administrative expenses.

9.  In the guerrilla areas, in addition to the provincial direct management, the education business should be expanded as much as possible, and senior and junior high school remedial schools should be widely established in each county to widely accommodate students who have dropped out of school in the war zone. Those established by the county itself should be subsidized with their expenses as much as possible by provincial funds, and should be treated more favorably than those in the rear. If teaching materials cannot be purchased, they should be issued by the province.

10. The Zhejiang West Administrative Office should set up a guerrilla area education supervision office, which should be organized by three to five supervisors selected by the Education Department to inspect the education in each county in the guerrilla area. (End)

News from Lixin Accounting College:

Mr. Pan Xulun, the director of the Lixin Accountant Firm in this city, and the other accountants in the firm, have always strived to promote accounting scholarship in our country. More than ten years ago, recognizing the shortage of accounting talent in our country, they established the Lixin Accounting Tutoring School, which has graduated nearly ten thousand students who are now spread throughout the country. Later, recognizing that accounting scholarship in our country had not yet developed rapidly and universally, they also began editing the Lixin Accounting Series, entrusting the Commercial Press to distribute it. To date, more than thirty types have been published. In 1937, in order to further cultivate advanced accounting talents, Mr. Pan and others donated over ten thousand yuan to establish the Lixin Accounting College, and additionally invited Chen Qicai, Song Hanzhang, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Yunwu, and Jiang Hengyuan to join as members of the school board. At that time, the school board was approved and filed by the Ministry of Education, and the school was approved to open. However, just as preparations were being actively made and after the first student enrollment, the August 13th Incident broke out. The school site was located north of the Suzhou Creek, making transportation inconvenient. And as the situation in Shanghai at that time was extremely unstable, the school decided to temporarily suspend operations. Recently, the school board, recognizing the large number of students seeking education in Shanghai, and the critical need for accounting talents in our country's future reconstruction efforts, again petitioned the Ministry of Education to approve the reopening of the school after the summer vacation this year. The approval has been granted. Currently, the school is temporarily using the Lixin Accountant Tutoring School site at 18 Jixiang Lane, Henan Road, as a temporary classroom, and the office is temporarily located in the Lixin Accountant Firm at 406 Jiangxi Road. It is reported that efforts are being made to actively find a suitable site in the downtown area of the city, with the aim of using existing funds to build school buildings within the shortest possible time, for long-term use. All regulations of the school will be in accordance with the laws and regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education, and the formal registration in the future should not be a problem. All graduates will be as readily employed as certified public accountants and take various higher examinations by the government as graduates of ordinary university business schools. It is also reported that, in order to facilitate the implementation of rigorous education, the school has decided to only enroll freshmen in the first grade this semester, and will not accept transfer students from the second and third grades. Admission requirements are graduation from a public or private high school, or equivalent qualifications (only one-ninth will be admitted), and passing the entrance examination. The first entrance examination is scheduled for the 10th and 11th of July.

However, not all members of the team are blind. The pitcher is partially blind, and the umpire cannot be blind. The results of the game are very satisfactory. This is another unique news story after the football team for the mentally ill.

American Independence Commemorative Special Edition

### Foreword

— A. Leman

The American "Declaration of Independence" has been regarded as one of the greatest turning points in history. Not only because it announced the birth of a new independent American nation, but also because it is a permanent challenge to autocratic politics and theocratic rule, it forever reminds people that "governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed."

This "Declaration" can be divided into three parts: The first part explains the equality of human beings and the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It also explains that the just power of government comes from the consent of the governed. When any form of government is harmful to the above rights, the government should be reorganized or overthrown. The second part of the "Declaration" is a table that lists twenty-seven types of abuses by the King of England. The third part is the formal "Declaration of Independence," as detailed in this publication.

This "Declaration" was drafted by a committee of the "Continental Congress," but it was actually drafted by Thomas Jefferson. The formal issuance date of this "Declaration" was July 4, 1776, and it was signed by fifty-six members of the "Continental Congress." However, this does not mean that this was only the opinion of fifty-six people. In fact, all the "colonies" had discussed it and had the support of a large number of people.

At that time and place, this "Declaration" created a new country, not by force, but by the development of an idea. Although war was inevitable after the "Declaration" was issued, the result was the realization of this idea.

Needless to say, the establishment of eighteen republican governments in North and South America was also influenced by this "Declaration."

Washington, the founding father of the Republic and the first President of the United States of America (born in 1732, died in 1799, and served as President for two consecutive terms from 1789).

### Symbol of Freedom – The Statue of Liberty in New York, USA

— Weixiang

As the mail ship sails into the port of New York, USA, new tourists always stand on the deck or lean against the window, looking into the distance at the world-famous dozens of skyscrapers in New York City. In addition to this, they are also filled with longing emotions to admire the symbol of this great free and democratic country—the Statue of Liberty.

The American Statue of Liberty is one of the greatest buildings in the United States and also the most gigantic bronze statue in the world. Her whole body is made of copper and part of iron, with a total weight of about 225 tons.

This Statue of Liberty is not the creation of the Americans themselves, but a gift from the freedom-loving French nation, symbolizing the indelible friendship between the two great democratic countries, and given to the United States. The designer and builder was the famous French sculptor Auguste Bartholdi.

Bartholdi began sculpting the Statue of Liberty in 1874. After two years of hard work, he completed the first part of it—the hand of the goddess holding the torch. The French first transported this hand from Paris to the United States, where it was exhibited in Philadelphia and New York. The Statue of Liberty was not completed until 1883. At this time, the base on which the Statue of Liberty stood began to be built in the port of New York, USA.

The Statue of Liberty is indeed rare in the world: From the goddess's heel to the top of the torch in the goddess's hand, it is 151 feet and 1 inch high. If the base on which the goddess stands is included, it is 305 feet and 6 inches high! In addition, the goddess's left hand is 16 feet and 5 inches long, the fingernails are about 1 square foot, the head is 17 feet and 3 inches long from the chin to the top of the head, the nose is 4 feet and 6 inches long, and the eyes are 2 feet and 6 inches long. The right hand holding the torch is as long as 42 feet!

Both the base of the Statue of Liberty and the Statue of Liberty itself have delicate and wide ladders built inside, which tourists can climb step by step. The most interesting thing is that the goddess's right hand, which is raised high, also has ladders installed inside, allowing people to climb all the way to the top of the torch! The head of the goddess can accommodate forty people standing; the exquisite platform built around the torch can also accommodate twelve tourists. When we look at the full picture of the Statue of Liberty, we feel that the torch she is holding in her hand is very small, but who knows that it is actually so big. This is really one of the great wonders of the world! (See photo)

The torch held by the goddess in her hand emits bright electric light at night. The electric light shines directly on the ground, bathing the entire goddess in bright and beautiful light, illuminating the surrounding area like daylight. Mail ship passengers entering the port at night can see this feature of New York City from miles away—the Statue of Liberty, symbolizing the land of freedom.

### Sino-American Friendship and Cooperation

Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the U.S. Far East Naval Fleet: On this American Independence Anniversary, it is worth recalling that since the first contact between the United States and China in 1784, the relationship between the two countries has been one of traditional peace and friendship. The United States is deeply willing to treat all parties with the principles of freedom and justice, so the earliest relationship with China was based on a policy of sympathy. This friendship and cooperation are increasingly integrated and become a sincere friendship, which will last for a long time. I sincerely wish and deeply believe that any incident between the two countries in the past will never change this harmonious and pleasant relationship, which will continue without interruption.

### Congratulations from Admiral Glassford of the U.S. Navy

— Xin Feng

On the 150th anniversary of American Independence, I wish the long-standing friendly relations between China and the United States will become closer and continue to be maintained forever.

### President Wilson's Speech on the American Flag

How bright and solemn is our national flag! It is a symbol of freedom and independence and the crystallization of the blood of countless martyrs. Now that we respect this bright and solemn national emblem, everyone should completely abandon all selfish and self-interested ideas; we should remember our unified will and the goal of great unity at all times. Today, I see that not all of you (referring to the audience) are wearing small national emblems on your clothes, which makes me feel a little unhappy. Now, I sincerely ask you, although you are not wearing the national emblem in form, you must always engrave this precious national emblem in your hearts!

### To Gain Freedom, One Must Sacrifice

U.S. Court Assessor in China, Hamilton Milk

The American people celebrate the anniversary of the signing of their Declaration of Independence as the most solemn festival, calling it "Independence Day," which has a long history. However, the American people celebrate this day because this day was the beginning of their decision for freedom; and what we must remember is that decisions cannot bring freedom with them. Freedom can only be truly achieved after a long period of time. Therefore, in order to make this decision effective, the American people endured a difficult and arduous war that lasted for seven years. The American people also endured all kinds of unfavorable trials, and finally, with the passage of the Constitution, the United States was truly established.

The lessons learned from the American nation's experience show that merely declaring lofty principles is not enough to achieve freedom and nobility. One must be prepared to endure great sacrifices, and in times of darkness, one must have unwavering determination, an independent will, and an unyielding spirit in order to succeed, and then permanently maintain and preserve what one has gained.

### U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss

### Wishing Chinese People to Share Independence and Freedom

The current President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, Smith, and other American residents in China, jointly held a National Day celebration today. Recalling the 163 years since the founding of the United States, the friendly relations and trade between China and the United States have always been maintained without change, and they are especially filled with ardent and sincere sympathy for China's current period of hardship and difficulty. We Americans are fortunate to be citizens of a free republic, and our joy is self-evident. What all people from business, industry, education and other sectors in China sincerely hope for is that the citizens of the Republic of China can also maintain their national independence and freedom and enjoy all their happiness.

### Sympathy and Understanding Amidst Joy

Richard, President of the American Junior Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai

Today, American citizens all over the world are celebrating the 163rd anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and the 150th anniversary of the implementation of the Constitution of the United States, truly grand events.

All American citizens in Shanghai are undoubtedly elated and celebrating, but amidst the joy, they all express their sympathy and understanding for the hardships encountered by the people of this great sister republic.

### Historical Facts About the American Declaration of Independence

The Declaration of Independence of the thirteen American states was formally passed by Congress on July 4, 1776. However, at the beginning of that year, representatives of the states were ordered to decide on the issue of independence by voting. At that time, the strongest advocate for establishing a permanent democratic government was Mr. Adams (John Adams). The passage of two resolutions by Congress on May 10 and 15, 1776, urging the states to unanimously organize independent governments, was also the result of Mr. Adams' advocacy. Subsequently, as declaring complete independence had already become a practical necessity, two committees were appointed on June 10, one responsible for drafting the declaration and the other responsible for planning the alliance. The drafting committee consisted of five members: Jefferson, Franklin, John Adams, Roger Sherman, and R. R. Livingston. The draft of the declaration was completed on June 28. After several days of delay, it was finally unanimously passed by the representatives of twelve states on July 4. New York also formally expressed its support for this declaration after convening a meeting on July 9.

According to a congressional resolution on July 19, the Declaration of Independence was written in beautiful calligraphy on parchment, and fifty-three representatives who were present at the time jointly signed it on August 2. As for the names of Matthew Thornton, Elbridge Gerry, and Thomas McKean, they were added later.

The Declaration of Independence was drafted by Mr. Jefferson and was not significantly modified. The original declaration was designated to be carefully kept by the State Department. In 1841, it was collected by the Trademark and Patent Office, as that office was part of the State Department. It was not returned to the State Department until 1877. In 1894, because the original faded and the parchment deteriorated daily, it was no longer exhibited and was carefully preserved. According to an order issued in 1823 by then-Secretary of State John Quincy Adams, a copperplate was engraved and printed with a woodcut image, which was distributed to each of the original signatories and their families. Now, a copy of the declaration, reduced from the authentic image, has been found, and a copperplate has been urgently made and printed as above.

### China's War of Resistance and the American Revolutionary War

— Hu Shih

Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, gave a speech in New York entitled "Japan's War of Aggression in China," comparing China's War of Resistance to the American Revolutionary War. His words were insightful and his language brilliant. We have excerpted the main points of his speech and disclosed them below, partly to commemorate the American Revolutionary War and partly to encourage the Chinese people who are continuing their War of Resistance.

I believe that China's current War of Resistance is a revolutionary war, with the same meaning and similar circumstances as the American Revolutionary War. The hardships that Washington's troops encountered at Valley Forge evoked boundless sympathy and praise from historians. It was the dead of winter. The soldiers had no shoes or socks to wear, and they marched barefoot, leaving only bright red bloodstains on the white snow. Washington reported to Congress that he now had only two thousand or so remaining troops, all of whom were scantily clad and no longer had the strength to fight. The number of people falling ill from hunger and cold was increasing day by day, the hospital was full of wounded and sick soldiers, and the equipment was pitifully inadequate, even lacking straw mats to lie on. Many wounded soldiers were dying on the frozen ground.

At this extremely critical juncture, Britain proposed peace talks, willing to unconditionally abolish all unequal laws. This was indeed a glorious peace proposal, and if the founding fathers of America had accepted it at that time, the bloodshed and sacrifice of the next four years could have been avoided. But in that case, they would have forever lost the even more glorious independence, and there would never have been a United States of America in the world.

At that time, the founding fathers of America resolutely rejected this peace condition and continued the War of Resistance for another four years without yielding. During those four years of bloody battles, the situation of danger and hardship was like spending a terrible winter in Valley Forge. They suffered countless military setbacks, the territory they lost grew day by day, internal disputes and difficulties arose frequently, and even acts of treason and betrayal emerged one after another. The value of paper money plummeted. Washington himself said, "A cartload of grain requires a cartload of paper money." At the beginning of 1780, one yuan of paper money fell to two cents; by the end of the same year, ten yuan of paper money was only worth one cent. Under such circumstances, it was simply impossible to maintain the soldiers' clothing and food.

But no matter how dangerous the situation, Washington and his comrades were determined not to give up the War of Resistance. They went through another four years of arduous struggle and finally won the final victory at Yorktown in January 1781.

From this perspective, the situation of the American army led by Washington at that time was not much better than that of the Chinese army resisting Japan today. Originally, all revolutionary wars are fought by people with inferior military strength, inspired by ideals and justice, against oppressors and aggressors with superior military strength. Their final victory always belongs to the invaded and the oppressed, because their unwavering belief in their cause, their loyalty and bravery, are enough to overcome all dangers and hardships!

### China is Sure to Achieve Satisfactory Results After This Crisis

Fessenden, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council

The friendly and long-standing relations between China and the United States have become a tradition. The years of contact in commerce, religion, and culture have indeed been a source of benefit to both countries. In other words, commercial progress has benefited both countries. China, in view of the sacrifices and efforts of American missionaries, is sincerely willing to accept their teachings, and the United States is inspired by the arduousness of their work and is thus spurred to greater effort. Chinese people also welcome our modern science and Western civilization, and we in turn learn from the ancient culture of the East and use it for our own benefit. All of this is indeed mutually beneficial.

Having lived in Shanghai for nearly eighteen years, based on my knowledge and experience of Chinese affairs, I am confident that I can confirm that China will achieve satisfactory results after this crisis. Shanghai is the meeting point of East and West, and East and West will determine the destiny of this world metropolis. I look forward to the future, and I am very pleased that Shanghai will become even greater, more prosperous, and more developed.

The new remittance system will be implemented today. Previously, banks and native banks each had their own remittance reserves. To facilitate the transfer of bills between the two parties, starting today, the native bank reserve and the bank joint reserve have agreed that the native banks will participate in the exchange through entrusted agency exchange. The United Banking Association has drafted measures and notified all member banks. The measures are as follows:

(1) Starting from July 4, for payment bills of banks entrusted for exchange by member banks and the Association's own payment bills, the various native banks should deposit them into the native bank reserve, and the native bank reserve should deposit them into the Association (i.e., the various native banks should directly deposit the corresponding numbers from their deposits with the Association under the name of the native bank reserve). Except for the Association's own payment bills and other payment bills of entrusted banks for exchange by the Association, the Association will handle the exchange on their behalf.

(2) Starting from July 4, for payment bills of the various native banks received by the exchange banks and the banks entrusted for exchange, the various banks should submit them to the Association for exchange at the exchange. For banks entrusted for exchange, the various banks should deposit the corresponding numbers from their deposits into the Association. The payment bills of the native banks exchanged back by the Association at the exchange, together with the payment bills of the native banks deposited into the Association by the entrusted banks, will be sent to the native bank reserve, and the native bank reserve will forward them to the various native banks.

(3) In addition to the provisions in the preceding paragraphs, all procedures for the native bank reserve to participate in the exchange shall be handled in accordance with the Association's measures for the exchange of bills of member banks.

(4) The exchange of bills between native banks shall still be handled as usual.

Measures for Receiving and Paying Returned Checks of Members

Regarding the measures for receiving and paying returned checks between the exchange banks, banks entrusted for exchange, and various member native banks, the following regulations are hereby stipulated and will be implemented starting from July 4:

(1) If there are any returned checks for bills submitted by the various banks to the various native banks, the various banks should send them to the Association with deposit slips, and the Association will directly return them to the original submitting native banks.

(2) If there are any returned checks for bills submitted by the various native banks to the various banks, the various native banks should send them to the Association with deposit slips under the name of the native bank reserve, and the Association will directly return them to the original submitting banks.

(3) Other procedures regarding returned checks shall still be handled in accordance with the Association's notice on checks.

Revised Time for Bill Exchange

The time for bill exchange between banks and native banks has also been revised and announced by the United Banking Association, stating, "The native bank reserve is scheduled to participate in the Association's bill exchange by means of entrusted agency exchange starting from July 4. In order to facilitate the exchange, starting from July 4, the Association's daily exchange time will be changed to 3:30 PM. The time for various banks and native banks to collect bills from outside and the time for the Association to collect bills from fellow banks and outside banks beyond the scope of exchange will remain the same."

### Amidst the Auxiliary Coin Panic, Let's Look at the New Auxiliary Coin Notes

The copper auxiliary coins in this city have almost disappeared from the market due to the purchase by a certain party. In addition to using stamps and stamp tax as temporary substitutes, trams and public buses issue vouchers and tokens for circulation. Foreign banks generally do not pay for the fractional amounts of checks. The current value of one-cent auxiliary coin is between 60 and 70 cents (i.e., one yuan of legal tender can be exchanged for 60 to 70 one-cent auxiliary coins), and it is still not easy to exchange. Because stamps and stamp tax are light in weight and easily lost, and easily soiled, they can only be used temporarily and cannot last. The city is eager for the Ministry of Finance to order the Central Bank to issue fractional auxiliary coin notes to facilitate the circulation of various industries and to comply with the Ministry of Finance's purpose of unifying the currency system. Now, I have obtained two auxiliary coin notes of one cent and five cents of the Zhejiang Local Bank, which are generally used in Zhejiang Province, from a friend. The design is good, so I made a plate and printed it below for reference. The front of the one-cent note is light blue, and the back is light green. The front of the five-cent note is red, and the back is light blue. However, it is generally believed that it would be more convenient to have two-cent auxiliary coin notes, and it is hoped that they will also be issued in Shanghai.

### Closing Accounts and Holidays: The Financial Industry Remains Stagnant

Yesterday, July 3, was the second day of the bank's mid-year closing and holiday. The cash and foreign exchange markets were still closed and there were no reports. The price of pure gold in the native bank exchange industry was still around 2,600 yuan, with no transactions. The selling price of gold jewelry in gold shops was also flat and unchanged. Major firms quoted 263 yuan, new firms quoted 261 yuan, and the purchase price was 255 yuan. There were no market prices for overseas silver markets and exchange rates due to the Monday holiday.

### Grain: Supply is Uninterrupted; Rice Market Continues to Decline; Hangzhou Restricts Selling Prices, and the Purchase Price of Ke Xian Rice is Very Harsh

Ke Xian Rice: Although transportation by truck is hindered, transportation by ship is still uninterrupted. The inventory in this city is still abundant. However, since various gangs from Hangzhou, Xia Shi, and other inland villages transported rice at low prices, the market has become quite active. Yesterday, transactions could have expanded after the two-day holiday, but due to the local price restrictions in Hangzhou, the highest price for polished rice cannot exceed 16 yuan, and machine-milled rice is also restricted. Therefore, although the demand from inland gangs is strong, the purchase price is very harsh, and they only select low-priced rice. The highest price offered for polished rice is 14.1 yuan, and the lowest is 13.67 yuan. Machine-milled rice is mostly offered at prices below 16 yuan. High-end rice is mostly handled by local merchants, and the market price is reduced by a small amount. Local merchants sold 1,500 to 1,600 bags.

Imported Rice: The spot price is affected by village customers. Although the sellers claim that the inventory is exhausted and refuse to sell at low prices, there are few inquiries from importers. The market remains quiet. However, it is said that the foreign production price is low and appropriate, and continuous transfer is still planned. In recent days, foreign firms are still selling in the market.

Du Geng Rice: Yesterday was the first day of trading after the two-day holiday on the first and second days of the month. Due to the heavy rain, few people came to the market. Moreover, there were more arrivals from various routes, including 14 ships of goods from Hexia to the southern gang, and nearly 3,000 bags of goods from Che Lun Baozi also arrived in Fengjing and other places, causing the market to suddenly weaken. Moreover, the sales of local merchants were poor, so sellers mostly reduced prices to sell, hoping to sell. However, the results were still ineffective. Except for special goods, the prices of both thick and thin japonica rice remained stable, while the prices of medium-grade and old-stock rice all softened. The price of Du Bu Jian rice also fell by one or two cents. A lot of foreign-produced rice has arrived, and because the rice was damaged by rain on the way, the sellers' morale is quite low, and they are all seeking to sell quickly. However, due to the lack of counterparties, the price fell sharply and it is difficult to say the standard. The price of upper-middle-grade goods has only sold for around 19 yuan.

Bian Yuan: The stomach is still not recovering, so it is still showing fatigue. The same is true for Hong Kong glutinous rice, which has opened at 19.67 yuan.

On the 4th, 3,300 bags of flour will be shipped to Tianjin.

### Oil Cakes: Soybean Oil Rises by Three Cents; Soybean Cakes Increase by Six Cents

Soybean Oil: Yesterday, the market continued the bullish trend at the end of last month, rising by another three cents, but the buying interest was still not strong enough. Moreover, the supply is uninterrupted, so although people are determined to be bullish, the overall situation has not seen drastic fluctuations. There was also little excitement in peanut oil. Yesterday, the total market opening was 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, priced at 33 yuan for the original disk, 300 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, priced at 31.8 yuan, 50 pieces of Qingqi oil, priced at 32.2 yuan, 100 pieces of Yanqi oil, priced at 33.6 yuan, and 50 barrels of Kobe-Lian oil, priced at 47.3 yuan.

Soybean Cakes: The market situation is entirely at the mercy of people's minds. First, because the Little Heat solar term is approaching, sales may be lively. Second, the Soviet attack has expanded, causing the selling price to suddenly become tense. However, in actual transactions, only 3,000 pieces of Dalian Yuanji cakes were settled, priced at 2.98 to 3 yuan, and 2,000 pieces of miscellaneous brand cakes, priced at 2.978 yuan, all of which rose by six cents compared to before the holiday.

### Sugar Market: Taikoo Sugar Rises by Two or Three Cents

According to the London telegram, the sugar market continued to rise yesterday. August was 8 shillings, 4 and three-quarters pence, up 1 and a quarter pence. December was 6 shillings, 5 and a quarter pence, up a quarter pence. March next year was 6 shillings, 5 and three-quarters pence, up half a pence. The local association’s price opening: Spot 24 coarse white sugar had no change, transit goods rose by one cent to 21.6 yuan. Taikoo chariot white sugar rose by two or three cents, West Wharf B Mark 30.3 yuan, 200 bags were traded. East Wharf 30.1 yuan, West Wharf CW Mark 30 yuan, CX 29.6 yuan, DY Mark 29.2 yuan, HX Mark 29 yuan, spot Dutch red sugar 20.8 yuan, transit 15 yuan. Local refined sugar and No. 1 water sugar had no changes. National sugar followed suit and opened with several hundred bags of miscellaneous Lu Qing sugar, priced at 16.45 yuan, and more than 300 bags of Diao Qing sugar, priced at 16.7 yuan.

On the 3rd, 1,000 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong and 1,290 bags came from Xiamen.

### Yarn and Cotton: The Cotton Market Has Been Full of Twists and Turns in the Past Month

Foreign Exchange Tightening

The Price of 20-Count Raw Cotton Once Exceeded 100 Yuan

Restrictions on Cash Withdrawals

Manufacturers Negotiate with Foreign Firms to Postpone Payments

Since the tightening of foreign exchange, general traders have had to sell their cotton quotas to spinning mills to settle their accounts. Calculated at the foreign exchange rate, the combined price is very high. They have had to buy back from those who have spot goods in hand to offset their positions. As a result, the market price once soared, coupled with the soaring yarn prices, and the raw cotton, which is closely related, became even better. The bullish trend was rampant, and new records never seen in the history of the cotton industry were recorded. The highest price for 20-count Indian cotton raw materials once reached 1034 yuan. However, there was little money for new orders of various cotton types from factories and firms because foreign exchange positions were not easy, and there was no new development. Unexpectedly, after the government implemented new measures to stabilize finance, bank credit suddenly became tight, and the market was once in a state of chaos. It was neither as welcome as before, nor were the discounts reduced. Moreover, with the semi-annual settlement period approaching, those who were short of cash on hand had to reduce prices to seek cash. The market price suddenly trended downward, and the price of 20-count raw materials fell below 100 yuan, to a price of 978 yuan. By the end of the week, because the closing period was over and the squeezing of positions had passed, the market state showed signs of recovery. However, the matter of firms reselling and reselling in the market is still difficult to sort out. As for the postponement of payments for cotton purchased by factories from foreign firms, the negotiations between the two parties are approaching and should be resolved soon.

There is still no trading in spot yarn and cotton.

The spot yarn market was closed yesterday, but after inquiring around, there was no trading. Most people are waiting for the situation to emerge before making an entry or exit. According to people in the industry, the market is still in a stable state.

There is also no market price for spot cotton. There are sources of goods on the wharf, but there is no report. It is expected that it will be known today.

### After the Restriction on Cash Withdrawals, the Method of Trading Cotton Yarn

Chinese textile industry has now become exhausted, and the golden age has passed. Inwardly, the purchase of cotton raw materials must be sought from imports; outwardly, the yarn and cloth markets of coastal hubs have successively fallen, or have been blockaded, such as only the Guangzhou Bay defense and Hong Kong lines are left. Also due to the congestion of goods, the way out is delayed, so the isolated island market of Shanghai has become the world of hoarders. Each warehouse is full of people, and speculators are pulling hard. Since the Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram restricted withdrawals, people were panicked for a while. In the yarn and cloth market, the original transaction required customers to prepare 70% remittance and 30% cash. To do ten or twenty pieces of 20-count yarn, you have to pay 1,450 yuan in cash immediately. Where can you get it? Go to the remittance to discount, and you will lose 15% of the discount fee. Both sides hold on, and it is difficult to solve. Recently, both buyers and sellers, because holding on is not a good policy, during the financial industry's closing settlement, and before there is a remedy before the customs closure, they implemented off-market transactions, that is, it is clear that 1,000 yuan of remittance is required (spot yarn). If it is impossible to collect and deliver cash, you can pay 1,100 yuan in remittance. Customers are unwilling to suffer this 10% loss, so the market price has to fall invisibly! It is said that the Shuangma brand (20-count) yarn only sells for 484 yuan for spot goods, and the warehouse order goods only sell for 476 yuan. The transaction volume is not large, and it is expected that it will be possible to do open trading again after the financial industry opens customs on July 4 and discusses a solution! (Zhao)

### North-South Goods: Hainan Longan Pulp is Out of Stock, and the Market Price Soars

Hainan longan pulp has not been continuously arriving recently, and the inventory in the market is gradually feeling the shortage. Therefore, the market is getting tighter day by day. Yesterday, it was heard that those who have a little stock on hand are raising the price by as much as six or seven yuan. Moreover, it is still far from the new season, and the market is bound to be strong.

### Coal and Charcoal: 20,000 Dan on the Way, Charcoal Merchants Already Raising Prices

Recently, there have been widespread rumors in the market that the Min River and Wenzhou are experiencing tense situations, and various ports along the coast have been blockaded. Consequently, people are guarding against shortages, and the charcoal trade has suddenly become lively, with prices rising sharply by four or five jiao. Top-grade charcoal from Wenzhou is now being quoted at three yuan and five jiao per dan. In reality, this is typically a slow season for sales, and the current sales volume is limited. Much of this activity is the result of speculators hoarding and manipulating the market. Furthermore, the city has ample reserves and there is no need to worry about shortages. It is reported that over 20,000 dan of charcoal are already loaded on sailing ships and en route. When they arrive, the price will surely ease.

### Metals: Rebar Sales are Considerable

Rebar sales have traditionally been most extensive among construction companies in this city, with demand from out-of-town groups also being significant. Recently, although prices of various goods have soared, trading has generally felt sluggish. However, rebar sales remain active due to strong demand from construction companies, causing prices to climb steadily. Currently, the market price is over 370 yuan per ton, a significant increase of 50 to 60 yuan compared to previous prices. It is reported that the volume of transactions yesterday reached 60 to 70 tons. Despite the heavy rain all day yesterday, actual transactions remained robust.

### Analysis of the New Exchange Draft (Xin Hui Hua)

— Ying Jun

(1) The Nature of the Old Exchange Draft

Shanghai's exchange drafts have traditionally been cashed the day after issue, a practice with a long history. Originating from Qianzhuang (traditional Chinese banks), permanent members of the Qianzhuang (now members of the Shanghai Money Trade Association, commonly known as "Exchange Draft Qianzhuang") established a general clearinghouse to facilitate interbank clearing. Each day, member banks would issue official receipts for funds mutually received and cleared at the general clearinghouse. If a Qianzhuang received funds that day and did not wish to cash them out, it would lend the funds to another Qianzhuang, a practice known as "splitting official receipts." If a Qianzhuang did not wish to lend out funds and preferred to cash them out, the Qianzhuang paying the funds would deliver the cash that night. However, for non-members (including foreign banks), cashing out was only allowed the day after issue. For example, if a customer wanted to buy goods from a foreign firm and needed to provide cash to the foreign bank, they would first obtain an exchange draft promissory note from the Qianzhuang and deliver it to the foreign firm. This method allowed the Qianzhuang to estimate the amount of unpaid drafts for the day and plan for the cash required to be delivered the next day. Therefore, silver and money businesses typically treated exchange drafts and clearing accounts as a single category on their books, without distinction.

(2) The Rising Exchange Draft Discount Rate

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident on August 13, 1937, the market has been extremely tense. The Ministry of Finance issued seven measures to stabilize the financial system and implement a monetary contraction policy. However, since its implementation, the market has urgently needed funds. The two associations of silver and money businesses, in order to increase the amount of circulating funds in the market, revised the exchange draft promissory note measures, presenting them to the Ministry of Finance for approval in the form of four measures. The first measure stipulated that "all promissory notes issued by silver and money businesses must be stamped with the interbank exchange draft mark. These notes can only be used for interbank clearing in Shanghai and cannot be used to pay legal tender or purchase foreign exchange." This measure utilized the exchange draft system to separate legal tender and exchange drafts into two different currencies. In the beginning, it was quite convenient. However, as the amount of exchange drafts in the market increased and the demand for legal tender grew, the supply of exchange drafts exceeded demand, while the demand for legal tender exceeded supply. Due to the relationship between supply and demand, the practice of discounting exchange drafts for cash emerged. This underground market trading was handled by small Qianzhuang (i.e., opium dens). The discount rate gradually rose from 6 or 7 yuan per thousand to 30 or 40 yuan. On June 7, 1938, it reached as high as 79 yuan. At that time, people were alarmed. Through the intervention of the Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee, commissioned by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, the situation was stabilized through coordination with member banks, and the discount rate stabilized at around 50 yuan. In November, due to the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, people's anxiety rose again, and the rate temporarily surged to over 60 yuan before quickly returning to normal. By the end of 1938, it had fallen to around 38 or 39 yuan, and the market had stabilized. From January to March and April 1939, the price remained between 20 and 40 yuan. From March 6, the price rose again to around 50 yuan. In April and May, there were no changes, and the market was considered stable. After the Ministry of Finance's telegram restricting withdrawals in Shanghai, the market experienced an extreme shortage of yarn tickets (Sha Piao). On June 22, the exchange draft discount even reached over 200 yuan, the highest price ever recorded, but there was little actual trading. On June 23, formal trading began with a price of 120 to 130 yuan. By June 30, the opening price was 90 yuan, but the closing price had already fallen to 72.5 yuan. Therefore, the exchange draft system implemented after August 13 to stabilize the financial system differed significantly from the previous system of cashing out the day after issue.

(3) The Issuance of the New Exchange Draft Certificate

The Shanghai Silver and Money Trade Associations, due to the Ministry of Finance's restrictions on withdrawals to prevent capital flight, stipulated that, starting from June 22, silver and money businesses in Shanghai, when paying out legal tender deposits made after August 13, would pay out legal tender for withdrawals up to 500 yuan per week, except for wage payments. Withdrawals exceeding 500 yuan would be paid out in exchange drafts. The public, already concerned about the shrinking foreign exchange reserves and wavering faith in legal tender, was further alarmed by this measure, leading to panic and rumors. Therefore, starting from June 22, banks and Qianzhuang experienced a run on deposits, and banknotes became extremely scarce. In addition to requesting the Ministry of Finance to instruct the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China to provide as much legal tender as possible to facilitate circulation, and to coordinate interbank funds to meet the needs of industry and commerce, they held meetings for several days to discuss the issue, resulting in the issuance of new collateralized certificates, namely the New Exchange Draft Certificate, to be handled by the Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee for interbank clearing purposes. Eighteen measures for interbank clearing and six rules for the Preparatory Inspection Committee were established (details in the June 27 newspapers). Ten simplified rules for the New Exchange Draft Certificate were also issued, attached below:

Rule 1: The Association issues Exchange Draft Certificates based on the resolution of the joint meeting of the Shanghai Banking Association and the Shanghai Money Trade Association.

Rule 2: Exchange Draft Certificates are backed by assets deposited by each bank or Qianzhuang with the Association.

Rule 3: The assets mentioned in the previous rule are limited to the following types:

(1) Primary Commodities;

(2) Securities with formal market prices in the Shanghai market;

(3) Income-generating real estate within the Shanghai concessions.

Rule 4: The total amount of Exchange Draft Certificates issued shall not exceed 70% of the total value of the assets.

Rule 5: Exchange Draft Certificates are issued in four denominations: 500 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, and 10,000 yuan.

Rule 6: The Association will pay for exchange draft checks with Exchange Draft Certificates, except for transfers.

Rule 7: Holders of Exchange Draft Certificates may not write or stamp seals on the certificates.

Rule 8: If Exchange Draft Certificates held by banks or Qianzhuang become soiled, damaged, or torn, they may apply to the Association to destroy them and reissue new certificates.

Rule 9: Only the issuing banks or Qianzhuang may report Exchange Draft Certificates as lost and request a stop payment order.

Rule 10: These simplified rules will be implemented upon resolution of the Standing Committee of the Association and sent to the Shanghai Banking Association and the Shanghai Money Trade Association for record. Amendments will be handled in the same manner.

(4) Collateral for the New Exchange Draft Certificate

(1) During this critical period, banks and Qianzhuang have adopted a tight credit and mortgage lending policy (perhaps not entirely so). This new Exchange Draft system promotes the increase of collateralized currency to coordinate interbank funds, making bank and Qianzhuang funds sufficient to meet the needs of industry and commerce, so as to promote the development of industry and commerce and the activity of the market.

(2) The total amount of Exchange Drafts to be issued by silver and money businesses is temporarily set at 50 million yuan, all of which must be collateralized. Banks and Qianzhuang must not excessively increase the amount of Exchange Drafts issued, leading to an oversupply, in order to reduce speculation and manipulation of the underground market for Exchange Draft discounts, and to stabilize the Exchange Draft system.

(3) The collateral for Exchange Drafts includes (1) primary commodities, (2) securities with formal market prices in the Shanghai market, and (3) income-generating real estate within the Shanghai concessions, but not cash yarn tickets (Sha Piao) and public bonds. This is because the New Exchange Draft Certificates serve two purposes: (1) to compensate for the shortcomings of restricted cash withdrawals, hence the minimum denomination of 500 yuan, as withdrawals below 500 yuan can be made in cash. (2) The old Exchange Draft was a credit currency for banks and Qianzhuang, while the New Exchange Draft Certificate is a collateralized currency, intended to increase credit to facilitate circulation among Chinese and foreign businesses. (3) If cash yarn tickets and public bonds are included as collateral for the New Exchange Draft Certificate, it would contradict the original intention of the silver and money businesses to alleviate the shortage of cash yarn tickets, as it is not currently intended to be a substitute for restricting cash yarn tickets. Furthermore, the issuance of the New Exchange Draft Certificate should be distinguished from the financial institutions that received 1 yuan cash yarn tickets based on the Ministry of Finance's April 1938 announcement of measures to improve local financial institutions, which allowed 20% of legal tender, public bonds, and real estate as collateral. Moreover, the issuance of the New Exchange Draft Certificate with a unit of 500 yuan has led to rumors of issuing small-denomination New Exchange Draft Certificates, which caused continued crowding for withdrawals on June 29 and 30. If cash yarn tickets and public bonds are used as collateral again, it would be misunderstood as a disguised form of circulating currency (if the decision is made to issue circulating currency, it should be considered separately as an initial trial).

(5) Handling of Old and New Exchange Drafts

In order to alleviate the shortage of legal tender among member banks and Qianzhuang, the Shanghai Silver and Money Trade Associations decided that the total amount of exchange draft deposits previously held in the Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee and the Qianzhuang Reserve Fund, amounting to 22 million yuan, would be converted into legal tender by the Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee in consultation with the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, based on 95% of the balance as of June 30 (equivalent to a 5% discount), starting from July 4 and ending on September 25, to be circulated over 12 weeks. However, for deposits of 10,000 yuan or less, due to need, they may be paid out in one lump sum after consultation. Furthermore, before September 25, member banks and Qianzhuang who receive New Exchange Drafts may use the unclaimed balance of legal tender converted from the original Exchange Draft as collateral, without the need for other collateral.

For example, if a bank has a balance of 1 million yuan in Exchange Drafts deposited with the Joint Reserve Committee as of June 30, it should submit a transfer application for 1 million yuan of Exchange Drafts, dated July 1, after the market opens on July 4, to the Joint Reserve Committee. The Joint Reserve Committee will convert it into 950,000 yuan of national currency at 95%, and deposit it into the bank's separate national currency account (newly opened account). The bank needs to withdraw the 950,000 yuan of legal tender in the separate account in 12 equal weekly installments, with each installment amounting to 79,166 yuan 6 jiao 6 fen 6 li. For convenience, the amount below 10 yuan in each installment will be included in the final installment. Therefore, each installment from the first week to the eleventh week will be 79,160 yuan, and the twelfth week (i.e., the last installment) will be 79,240 yuan. It is also stipulated that Tuesday of each week is the day for each withdrawal transfer. Each bank and Qianzhuang should submit a separate national currency account application to the Joint Reserve Committee, which will then transfer the funds to the bank's national currency current account for use.

As for exchange drafts deposited by general depositors after August 13, they will still be paid in exchange drafts in the future and cannot be converted into cash yarn tickets at 95%.

(6) The Origin of Rumors about Circulating Currency

Recently, due to the Ministry of Finance's telegram restricting withdrawals and the implementation of the system of providing real collateral by silver and money businesses to receive interbank Exchange Drafts from the bank reserve committee, increasing the new currency, some who did not understand this mistakenly believed that circulating currency would be issued starting from July 4. This led to general depositors rushing to withdraw legal tender from banks to store at home or in bank safety deposit boxes. According to reports, banks and Qianzhuang experienced withdrawals amounting to the full value of deposits on June 22 to 24, due to a misunderstanding of the Ministry of Finance's telegram. From June 26 to 28, after the true meaning of the telegram was clarified, the withdrawals subsided. However, on June 29 and 30, rumors spread again, saying that silver and money businesses would issue circulating currency after a three-day holiday for the semi-annual settlement, so another wave of withdrawals began. It is estimated that the total amount of legal tender paid out by silver and money businesses from June 22 to 30 was approximately tens of millions of yuan, which is a truly alarming figure. It is important to understand that, according to Rule 6 of the Joint Reserve Committee's simplified rules, the Joint Reserve Committee will pay for exchange draft checks with Exchange Draft Certificates, except for transfers. Under the current circumstances, all sectors that receive checks from silver and money businesses drawn on the Joint Reserve Committee convert them into promissory notes that circulate in the market and are transferred to banks or Qianzhuang for collection. Since banks and Qianzhuang all conduct transfer transactions with the Joint Reserve Committee, the circulation of Exchange Draft Certificates in the market will be very limited in the future. Therefore, the purpose of the Ministry of Finance's telegram is to contract the currency, and the implementation of the new Exchange Draft system by silver and money businesses is to centralize reserves and facilitate circulation. The aim of both is to stabilize the financial system. It can also be said that the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China are lowering the current high discount rate, converting legal tender to member banks and Qianzhuang at a price of 50 yuan per thousand, to be withdrawn in 12 equal weekly installments.

However, what we hope for is that all responsible parties will exercise caution in manipulating financial measures in the future, so as not to create the same rumors as today. Who knows if the rumors will become reality in the future? As for all parties involved in publicity, they should recognize the facts, the times, the circumstances, and the overall interests (not focusing on one aspect) when speaking. Although there were sophists in ancient Greece, there is no shortage of repeating machines in the modern world. The facts cannot be denied in the end.

Discourse

### On Chinese Medical Art (5)

— Zhang Feng

How to Treat

Medicine, after all, is not philosophy. The six-number concept derived from the concept of the six directions resulted in the ancient medical theory of the six excesses (六淫) as causative agents. Chinese medicine has been based on this and has been developed and interpreted throughout the ages without ever undertaking a process of summarization. This has led to confusion and complexity that is difficult to unravel. So, how can hundreds of diseases be cured? Of course, this requires discussing therapeutic efficacy and drug efficacy. The issue of drug efficacy is beyond the scope of this article and can be skipped. But what about therapeutic efficacy? The therapeutic efficacy of Chinese medicine is not a miracle. It is simply an ordinary and peaceful efficacy, so ordinary that it is no longer ordinary, and even verges on being ineffective. What a joke! Talking about efficacy but starting with ineffectiveness is too humorous! We still hope that it is effective.

Its efficacy first requires finding the source of the disease. Finding the source of the disease is no easy task. It uses a therapeutic outline, or a general therapeutic framework. This framework is constructed using the above-mentioned six fu organs and six sensory organs (plus five zang organs, four limbs, nine orifices, hundreds of bones, etc.), six excesses, six causes, six symptoms, six meridians, six methods, and seven emotions and six desires, etc., to form a systematic diagnosis. This requires relying on experience, skill, knowledge from books, and historically transmitted formulas, and then adding, subtracting, increasing, or decreasing them, and determining the order of their administration. There are also the so-called seven, ten, or twelve doses, weighing their importance, measuring their length, and quantifying their amounts. Chinese physicians rely on this to complete their tasks. Those who understand it with utmost clarity can demonstrate the supreme artistic skill of "transcending the image and capturing the essence." Medicine at this point can be said to be unscientific, but it cannot be said to be unartistic. Even if Chinese medicine opens its doors wide and integrates foreign medical techniques, such as those from ancient Qin, Yue, the Western Regions, India, and Mongolia, and the more recent European medicine, the more it is integrated, the more unscientific it becomes, but the essence of art cannot be erased. Two idioms are quoted to praise it: "Its transforming influence covers plants and trees, and its benefits reach all directions." Is this excessive?

Organization is Essential

Although art is complex, intricate, and full of confusing threads, if it is abandoned and ignored, it will become increasingly chaotic and overwhelming, and the uninformed will view it as magical. In this day and age, there must be people with new knowledge and old acquaintances who are not stubborn, not corrupt, and are willing to organize it calmly, so that there is hope for the continuation of its legacy. Otherwise, Chinese medicine, unable to uphold the old ways and unable to start anew, will be practiced by ignorant village doctors who only know a little addition and subtraction, and pharmacists who rashly engage in it. Alas! What about medicine? What about art? Knowing me, blaming me, I write this article, I fear for the present age, fearing that I will be a sinner against medicine! And also fearing that I will be a sinner against art!

A Slogan

Theories are not entirely trustworthy! Because there are incomprehensible theories. Believing them will lead to death by theories. Experience is not entirely reliable! Because there is distorted experience. Relying on it will lead to death by experience. Only the wisdom of art, acting between theory and experience, coupled with talent and learning, can make it complete. (End)

Popular Medical Talks

### Talking About Trachoma

— Shi Zeyong

"With eyes, paradise; without eyes, hell." These two sentences describe the importance of eyes to a person. So, why does a person "have eyes" or "not have eyes"? The so-called "without eyes" here refers to the loss of their inherent function due to illness. Because humans, except for a very small number who are oppressed during the embryonic stage or cannot fully develop due to other reasons, all have complete visual organs.

"Since 'without eyes' is caused by disease, then if we want to enjoy the pleasure of 'paradise', we should treat or prevent diseases. However, there are many types of eye diseases, and it is impossible to describe them all at once. Therefore, this article can only discuss trachoma, which accounts for the majority of eye diseases:

We often hear people say that nine out of ten Chinese people suffer from trachoma, which is a bit of an exaggeration. When I worked at a certain hospital last year, I did a statistical analysis of patients, and those with trachoma accounted for about 50% to 60% of eye diseases.

Depending on the speed of symptom onset and the duration of the course, trachoma can be divided into two types: chronic and acute. In acute cases, if treated properly, recovery can be expected soon. However, most cases result in only temporary reduction of inflammation due to improper or inconsistent treatment, and the inflammation does not disappear completely, eventually transitioning to chronic cases.

In the early stages of trachoma, there are no significant subjective or objective symptoms. Slightly later, the conjunctiva of the fornix (i.e., the uppermost part of the conjunctival surface of the upper eyelid), the semilunar fold (i.e., the crescent-shaped red structure attached to the bulbar conjunctiva at the inner canthus), the conjunctiva at the inner and outer canthi (i.e., the conjunctiva at the junctions of the upper and lower eyelids), and even the entire tarsal conjunctiva (i.e., the conjunctival surface visible when the eyelid is everted, especially the upper eyelid conjunctiva) become thickened and red, and become turbid, so that the blood vessels can no longer be seen clearly. In addition, there is proliferation of papillae, making the surface rough, like red velvet, with small granules visible among them. At this stage, subjective symptoms are also very obvious. The patient's eyes often feel itchy, uncomfortable, and tired after reading or working for a short time. There is also increased eye discharge, and perhaps suddenly blurred vision! In medical terms, this is a temporary visual disturbance.

Further on, the tissue surrounding the granules enters the granules, so the granules then become scarred. The area becomes depressed, forming a white, opaque tendon-like structure with unclear borders, like a cloud. If the lesion further invades the deep layers, and the levator palpebrae superioris muscle (i.e., the muscle that raises the upper eyelid) becomes paralyzed, ptosis (drooping eyelid) occurs. If the scar contracts, the palpebral fissure (eyelid opening) narrows, and entropion (inward turning of the eyelid) and trichiasis (ingrown eyelashes) occur. At the same time, the inverted eyelashes rubbing against the cornea cause photophobia (sensitivity to light), tearing, foreign body sensation (as if something is in the eye), dryness, and pain. Subsequently, because the cornea is constantly rubbed by the eyelashes, the cornea also develops various lesions, such as blood vessels entering from the bulbar conjunctiva, or elliptical or kidney-shaped corneal ulcers, or diffuse fine turbidity points on the superficial layer, or lipid deposition in the central part, so that the transparent cornea becomes turbid and cannot transmit light, greatly reducing vision, or even leading to blindness. How dangerous that is!

In addition to the above-mentioned changes in the conjunctiva and cornea, the mucous membrane of the lacrimal duct is also affected. Due to scar contraction, nasolacrimal duct obstruction occurs, leading to epiphora (constant overflow of tears from the eye socket). Furthermore, chronic dacryocystitis often develops. Therefore, the harm of trachoma is truly terrible! I will briefly describe several methods of prevention below:

(1) Towels should be for individual use and their cleanliness should be maintained at all times.

(2) The washing utensils of patients should be separate from those of healthy individuals.

(3) When the towels or washing utensils commonly used by patients must be given to others, they must be washed thoroughly and then boiled or rinsed with boiling water.

(4) Clean eye discharge with a clean towel or handkerchief.

(5) Keep fingernails short at all times, and always pay attention to the cleanliness of your hands.

(6) In public places such as barber shops, bathhouses, amusement parks, restaurants, etc., it is best not to use public towels to wipe your hands or face. If unavoidable, keep your eyelids tightly closed to prevent intrusion into the eyes.

(7) When using public bedding and pillows during travel, bring your own sheets and pillowcases to cover them.

(8) Do not shake hands with patients.

Common Knowledge of Diseases

### Stomach Disease (4)

— Zhuang Weizhong

B. Gastric Ulcer

Gastric ulcer is a very common disease, caused by many factors, often with a genetic relationship. Meat-eaters are relatively more likely to suffer from this disease. In addition, this disease is related to occupation, such as shoemakers often compressing the pit of the stomach during work, thus easily leading to this disease. In addition, external trauma to the stomach, burns over the whole body, can also cause this disease, and tuberculosis, syphilis, anemia, and cardiovascular diseases can contribute to this disease.

Gastric ulcer patients are mostly middle-aged, with no significant difference between men and women.

The most common sites for gastric ulcers are the posterior wall of the stomach, the lesser curvature, and the pyloric region, because the action of gastric acid is most vigorous in these areas, and the cause of this disease is actually the erosion of weakened gastric tissue by gastric acid.

There is usually only one ulcer, but a small number of people may have two or more.

Many people already have this disease, but they do not know it themselves. Some may not have any symptoms during the course, and suddenly experience severe bleeding or even perforating peritonitis. Others may only have chronic gastritis symptoms for a long time, mistakenly believing it to be chronic gastritis or hyperacidity.

That being said, most cases have very obvious symptoms:

One is ulcer pain, which is further divided into stomach pain, back pain, and tenderness: (1) The nature of stomach pain is like stabbing or burning, located in the pit of the stomach. Ordinary people often mistake it for heart pain, but heart pain only occurs during heart attacks. This disease is very dangerous. What is commonly called heart pain is actually still stomach pain. The pain occurs after eating something and is related to the quality and quantity of food. Generally, eating things that are too hot, too cold, or too hard is particularly likely to cause pain. In most cases, pain occurs half an hour to an an hour after eating. If there is too much stomach acid, then there may even be pain immediately after eating, and some may even have pain on an empty stomach. Here, I also want to say something of great research value, that is, in women with gastric ulcers, if the menstrual flow is heavy during menstruation, the stomach pain may be relieved, and if the menstrual flow is very light, the stomach pain is even worse. During pregnancy, stomach pain attacks are less frequent and often stop. Also, the stomach pain of this disease often occurs regularly throughout the year, for example, every spring and autumn, there are one or two weeks when stomach pain often occurs after eating, year after year, which is called periodic attacks. (2) Back pain is also an important symptom, like being bitten. (3) Tenderness means pain upon pressure; the location of tenderness is the pit of the stomach, with a fixed point of tenderness.

Common Knowledge of Diet and Nutrition

### Scientific Research on Diet and Nutrition (Continued from Issue 20)

— Zhou Zhenyu

Since the structural formulas of sugars are different, their uses are also different. Glucose is the only carbohydrate that can meet the needs of the human body. Therefore, when treating typhoid fever and other severe diseases, doctors can inject a solution of this sugar into those who cannot take food or drink, which not only does not consume the digestive capacity of the gastrointestinal tract, but also maintains life, saving countless people. The development of science cannot be said to have no contribution to mankind.

Glucose is sweet and soluble in both hot and cold water and alcohol. It has reducing power. Reducing power is a chemical action that can decompose compounds of silver, mercury, bismuth, and copper, etc., and turn them into their original forms of silver, mercury, bismuth, and copper. Therefore, doctors use it to test whether there is glucose in the liquid.

Fructose is mostly found in fruits, but we mostly extract it from sucrose, because fructose is one molecule of its structure.

Lactose is found in the milk of mammals and is one molecule of lactose, hence the common name lactose. It is related to the development of nerves in infants, so it is found in milk. It combines with glucose to form lactose.

Disaccharides are carbohydrates formed by the combination of two sugar atoms. Their structure is C12H22O11, and there are three types: sucrose, lactose, and maltose.

Sucrose is the most widely distributed, because the amount produced by sugarcane is the largest, hence the name sucrose. However, it is also found in other plants, such as radishes, melons, and honeycombs. It is the sweetest and soluble in both hot and cold water, but more difficult to dissolve in alcohol. Its decomposition becomes glucose and fructose, C12H22O11 + H2O = C6H12O6 + C6H12O6. In the human gastrointestinal tract, it also turns into glucose and fructose through fermentation. Fructose then undergoes a further change and also turns into glucose. As such, this substance has no waste for the human body. The creation of nature is truly infinite.

Lactose is the most important carbohydrate in milk, and its decomposition becomes lactose and glucose. Milk is generally the only fuel for mammals. It is not very sweet, not easily soluble in water, and has a weaker reducing power. In the gastrointestinal tract, it undergoes decomposition through fermentation, becoming glucose and lactose.

Maltose is the carbohydrate in grains that produces disaccharide glucose through fermentation.

Polysaccharides are starches in grains. Their structure is more complex, often written as (C6H10O5)n, because it has not yet been determined how many (C6H10O5) combine to form starch, so n is used as its index. Its decomposition is also more complex. Now, the process of its decomposition is listed in the table on the left.

Cellulose is the texture of plants, more solid than other starches. Its decomposition also turns into glucose. It is not easily digested in the human gastrointestinal tract. Eating too much causes diarrhea. Herbivores have a kind of yeast in their gastrointestinal tract that has the ability to digest cellulose, so eating it does no harm. Although humans can eat the cellulose of vegetables, it must be heated to soften its nature before it can be eaten. In this way, it can avoid harming the gastrointestinal tract. Dextrin is a substance produced by the decomposition of starch. When it meets iodine, it appears red. This type of dextrin is called red dextrin, and the colorless one is called white dextrin. It is sticky but not sweet, so it can be used as paste. (To be continued)

### Describing the Circus

Last night at nine o'clock, I went to see the Italian Chiarrini Circus. The horses were all handsome and well-trained. The acrobatic leaps and jumps on horseback were swift and agile, beyond what other countries could achieve. The most crowning act was that one person inserted a wooden pole more than two fathoms long into his abdomen, and without holding it with his hands, was able to stand tall without swaying from side to side, which was already remarkable. Then, another person climbed the pole to the top, like a monkey climbing a tree. He then performed skills on the tip of the pole, suddenly falling forward with his abdomen on the tip, so that his whole body was prostrate on the ground. Suddenly, with one hand gripping the tip of the pole, his whole body hung horizontally in the air, as if lying on a couch. Now somersaulting, now spinning, displaying various skills for about an hour, then climbing down the pole. And this pole was placed on the ground, as if firmly inserted into the ground, with no shaking or tilting, which can be called an extraordinary skill. The venue is located on the west end of Four Horse Road. The seat prices are: box seats 5 yuan, first class 1 yuan, second class 50 cents, third class 25 cents. There are 25 performers, 30 horses, and a guanaco monkey, which is also good at performing. There were many spectators, but few upper-class guests. Western venues are lively, relying on courtesans to add to the fun. Courtesans cannot move without their maids, and now having the maids come along requires additional fees, so courtesans are not encouraged to come. Young masters can also save a little money. Moreover, the programs are all in Western characters, which the Chinese do not understand, making it difficult to know the reason for the plays. This shows a lack of understanding of Chinese customs and culture.

### Official Note on Collecting Boat Fees

Twenty-two store owners at the old bridgehead on the Suzhou River submitted a petition to Minister Chen, requesting notification to the consuls of the concessions to prevent the people of the Municipal Council from collecting boat fees from the small boats coming from the inland, in the hope that business would improve and all industries would prosper. However, the Municipal Council said: "The small boats that come to Shanghai all use the wharves, and we must send people to take care of them. Since people are sent, expenses will increase, so we have to collect donations to make up for it." However, those who abuse their power to collect fees illegally have been strictly investigated and prohibited.

### Ostentation

— Moye

In the city, especially in the metropolis, everyone pays attention to ostentation.

From a personal perspective, the saying "Respect clothes, not the person" means that clothes are a person's ostentation. Mencius said, "If Xishi were covered in filth, everyone would hold their nose and pass her by." Most of us are not beautiful like Xishi, so how can we not pay attention to this? Thus, "Lotus Young Masters" or "Osmanthus Young Masters" are born; if their pockets are empty, they simply call a taxi to a friend's place to borrow money; if they suddenly become rich and become officials, they especially want to be extravagant, drinking and watching plum blossoms, etc., are naturally given priority.

These people, and generally everyone, look down on simple and honest people, especially those who are "rich in poetry and books, but have a natural elegance" who are "unshaven and unkempt." These people certainly have some who are actually starving, and some who really have nowhere to rest their heads at night, but they regard these as secondary and try their best to develop their personal ostentation.

The development of personal ostentation naturally easily leads to the development of family ostentation. I know for a fact that there are several great men who have no fixed assets or permanent occupations, but their family ostentation is very grand. They live in Western-style houses, ride in cars, and eat [large dishes] in front of guests. When they call out in the hall, there are at least three or four responses from below. Their ostentation, if not like that of high officials and nobles, is at least like that of wealthy merchants. They sometimes beg their creditors or complain to close friends, saying that expenses are too high. However, if you advise them to be thrifty, they have their own reasons to answer you: the greater the ostentation, the more ways to make a living; the smaller the ostentation, the fewer ways to make a living.

This philosophy of life is of course not only applicable to individuals or families, but seems to be applicable everywhere, especially to the shops of today.

We often hear bosses say that seven tenths of the capital is used for the decoration of the facade, and only three tenths is used for the goods. Thus, when we sell candy, we have to spend a lot of money to buy the boxes or paper bags that hold the candy; when we go to a restaurant, we have to pay for the restaurant's rent and equipment; as for seeing a doctor and having to pay for his black-plated car, or taking medicine and having to pay for the pharmacy's huge advertising fees... that goes without saying.

These bosses plan this way, and the facts prove that they are not acting recklessly: the greater their ostentation, the better their business, otherwise it won't work. We can also often see old shops that have been passed down for hundreds of years renovating their facades, and goods that are famous far and wide beautifying their appearance. In order to survive and develop, they have no choice but to pay attention to ostentation.

Why is ostentation so successful? It's all because everyone is paying attention to ostentation. Why does everyone want to pay attention to ostentation? It's all because everyone is not objective and only likes the false. The current world is a world of "false" beauty and goodness. False is beauty, is goodness, so everyone yearns for it, like water flowing downwards, unstoppable. Oscar Wilde said it well, art is false, false is art. People come to me with falsehood, and I have no choice but to respond with falsehood. One falsehood leads to universal falsehood, and thus ostentation is valued.

Ostentation is equal to pretense. Pretenses can be made of rosin, or used to place tofu. Knowing that they are unreliable and powerless, one still cannot help but build them up to seek success. Thus, a great nation often brandishes swords and draws bows, seeming to swallow other countries in one gulp; when they suffer, they do not reverse the facts, but try their best to exaggerate their own contributions. …

If the nation pays so much attention to ostentation, why blame individuals for doing the same!

### Ancient War Song

— Yu Liu

Who says there are no wonderful war songs in ancient China? Who says China is full of romantic and lyrical poems? Wu Yi's "Essentials of Ancient Yuefu Themes" says: "Chiyou led monsters to fight the Yellow Emperor in the wilderness of Zhuolu. The Emperor first ordered the blowing of horns in the sound of dragons to resist them. Later, when Wei Wu (Cao Cao) led his troops north to conquer Wuhuan, they crossed the desert. The soldiers heard the sound and became sad and homesick, so it was reduced to the sound of cows, which was even more sorrowful." This may be considered the origin of war songs. But the ancients feared war, so they avoided talking about such tunes. Moreover, the ancients thought that literature should not be used for war, but should be used instead. Therefore, there are more poems of abandoning war than poems of resisting war.

The so-called poems of abandoning war mostly write about the hardships of expeditions; poems of resisting war mostly write about the joy of fighting and joining the army. Every dynasty in ancient times had wars. Although there was no national consciousness, the heart of loyalty to the emperor and serving the country existed since ancient times. Imagine fighting once to pacify the northern barbarians, fighting again to subdue the Xiongnu, singing victory songs on the return journey, the elders of the capital welcoming you to the suburbs, granting you ten thousand miles of land, enfeoffing you as a marquis with ten thousand households, and your portrait hanging in the Lingyan Pavilion, is this not the joy of war!

Since they were loyal to the emperor, they regarded war as a way to repay his kindness. Yu Shiji's "Leaving the Frontier" says: "The high general's three strategies are far-reaching, the commander-in-chief's nine mandates are revered. I remember the integrity of my old friend, and think of repaying the kindness of my wise lord." Wang Wei's "Marching Song" says: "The sun sets over the desert, the sound of battle is in the dust. Use the head to repay the king's favor, and report to the Son of Heaven with victory." They all prioritize the emperors of the world, fight for the emperor, and kill the enemy for the emperor. In fact, the country in the hearts of the ancients was the private property of the emperor. This kind of loyalty is not a foolish idea, but is actually a major case of loving the country.

There are many such examples in Tang Dynasty literature. Gao Jiao's "Expressing My Feelings" says: "I regret the lack of strategies for pacifying the Rong, and I am ashamed to ascend the altar of generals. Holding cold gold and iron in my hands, and wearing cold iron clothes on my body. It is easy to support the emperor, but difficult to repay the deep kindness. The three borders are still not quiet, how dare I retire from my official position?" This truly shows the great sense of responsibility, which is still valuable even if moved to today.

Liu Xiaocheng's "Poem of the Water of Longtou" says: "I often see the Hu cavalry drinking, and I am always ashamed for the Han country. I tie my wife's hair into two swords, and sacrifice my son to the iron hook. I take the skull of the fierce Loulan, and seize the fur of Zhizhi." Although it is a feudal national idea, it ultimately aroused the concept of patriotism under the feeling of self-respect for the sacred Chinese nation. Not only are they "not afraid to die outside the border," but they also "tie their wife's hair" and "kill their son" without hesitation. They resolutely fight for the country, and what is their personal affairs worth!

Du Fu's Songs of Leaving the Frontier have their literary value, and other war songs related to war, except for a few with slightly inferior writing skills, can also be discussed. For example, Zhang Zhongjing's "Song of the Frontier" says: "The north wind flutters open Yanmen, and the flat sand rolls up the roots of tumbleweeds. I am ashamed to count the number of captives, and I will directly slay Loulan to repay the country's kindness." Li Xizhong's "Song of Jizhou" says: "I save the distant borders with my own body, and the beacon fire connects to Jizhou. The birds fly across the vanguard, and the fighting dust is dim. The cold sun makes the drum sounds urgent, and the chieftain's night fire rushes. I must always sacrifice loyalty and righteousness, and die to repay the country's kindness." These are all good epoch-making works.

Of course, everyone has selfish desires. Although they say they are rushing to the battlefield for two countries, they have some desire for fame and fortune in their hearts. Although "I am a visitor from You and Bing, and I do not discuss loving to establish merit" (Xue Qizhong's "Song of the Frontier"); although "Life is moved by righteousness, who can discuss fame?" (Wei Zheng's poem); however, "If there is no face of a marquis, it is in vain to be a visitor from You and Bing!" (Gu Kuang's line from "Marching Song"). Establishing merit and enjoying fame, although it cannot be said that everyone has this ambition, it is still inevitable for most people. And see Wang Ya's "Song of Marching": "The Yan jaw has many strange appearances, and the wolf friends dare to invade the border? Tell Ban Dingyuan, this is the year to establish merit." Liu Jia's "Sending Off the Conscripts": "In the past, sending off the conscripts was bitter, but today sending off the conscripts is happy. Although you bring cold clothes with you, you should look at them when you return. The emperor is waiting for you to achieve merit, and will build the Lingyan Pavilion separately." Zhang Hu's "Picking Mulberry": "There have been many conquests since ancient times, and they come out still wearing armor. They drive thousands of miles away, and in one fell swoop pacify the Western Barbarians. They hold their swords from the desert, and songs and ballads fill the imperial capital. Tell the generals of the world, they must establish military merit and fame." They all take the marquis of ten thousand households as a fantasy, take the Lingyan Pavilion as an expectation, take the inscription of merit on Yanran Mountain as hope, and take the reputation of being recorded in history as the goal. Then, the brave men rush to righteousness, with good reason to entrust their lives.

When they return victorious, they are even more overjoyed. They sing war songs loudly, and their voices raise in victory. The heroic spirit of war, all is in their throats and under their pens, as sound and as poetry, arousing the strength for the long-term survival of the country.

### Performance of the Umbrella Policy

— Ma Wen

### John Bull's Cleverness

— Zhi

I have never been willing to praise John Bull. After seeing John Bull's response in a certain place recently, I cannot help but say: John Bull is clever—

"Don't be surprised by strangeness, and the strangeness will defeat itself," this is what we all know. But it is easy to say, but to truly achieve the point of "not being surprised" requires great determination and patience. John Bull has actually "not been surprised" in the face of provocation, insult, and all kinds of unbearable actions. John Bull has already achieved half of the success, although complete success still depends on future efforts.

If John Bull "got angry," things would be a bit uncertain. Imagining it: first, causing a stir in a certain place, and then those with ulterior motives forcing their family to admit the established fact and support them in fighting with John Bull's entire family to the end. In this way, the goal of those with ulterior motives who only want to cause trouble in the world would be achieved.

Now, John Bull is "not angry," and the family of those with ulterior motives is not willing to turn their faces and truly have a hard time with John Bull. They can only deal with John Bull perfunctorily. Although John Bull has suffered some small losses on the surface, in fact, he has picked up a big bargain, so I say that John Bull is clever.

However, if John Bull wants to rely entirely on cleverness to cope, then it may not be so clever. In today's world, after cleverness, strength should follow closely. Clever John Bull, rise up quickly!

### The Life of the Great Ukrainian Poet, Shevchenko (Part Two)

— Bare Hands

Needless to say, Shevchenko was also a member of this organization. This organization was originally secret, but because of a traitor within, all the key figures were arrested at once. The day Shevchenko was arrested was precisely the day Kyiv University officially offered him a position.

The prisoners were all escorted to St. Petersburg. After a severe trial, most were sentenced to life imprisonment. Fortunately for Shevchenko, because he had only recently returned to Kyiv, the evidence was not very strong, and the charge against him was only that he had slandered the Tsar in his poetry. Therefore, the sentence was relatively light: only being sent to a military service in the deserts of Central Asia.

During his military service, he left behind many letters, almost all of which were excellent literary works. On several occasions, he wrote to his friends asking them to send him Gogol's works. He loved Gogol as much as he loved his Ukraine. He understood Gogol's satire and recognized the common ground between his own lyricism and Gogol's. In a letter to Gogol, he once left behind a famous saying: "You are laughing, and I am crying!"

Several times, he asked his friends for old Ukrainian annals. Several times, he reported to his friends how happy he was when he received a history of his homeland written by Kulish…

Year after year passed, and finally, in 1857, he was pardoned and returned to his country. By then, ten years had passed, and his spirit and body had been ruined on the shores of the Aral Sea. But time had not been wasted for him; he wrote his famous ten-year diary. In that record of what could be called a great life, every page was filled with his fiery passion for Ukraine.

His name had already penetrated deeply into the Ukrainian people. Some of his poems had become Ukrainian folk songs, sung by everyone morning and evening. Yet he was still the same as before, or even worse: lonely, poor, wandering everywhere. To make a living, he continued his profession as a painter. He specialized in painting portraits.

But he continued to attack the Tsarist government; ten years of exile had not weakened his will. However, he also received his reward in Russian society at the time: in contrast to his native Ukraine, the citizens of St. Petersburg or other cities of Imperial Russia took a cold or even hostile attitude towards his poetry.

What happened to him afterward? — He was unable to develop his talent further for a longer time after his exile, like Dostoevsky. Only three years after his return, he fell ill. Before he passed away, he had returned to Ukraine, intending to live there permanently, but to recover his health, he had to return to St. Petersburg, where he finally died. He died in 1861, on February 25th, the same day as his birthday.

His most famous collection of poems is entitled "Kobzar." The meaning of this title is "blind poet." All the poems that Ukrainians often recite are included in this collection. Unfortunately, it is not possible to introduce it in detail here; perhaps there will be another opportunity next time. But this collection of poems now has a Russian translation, and friends who understand Russian will not find it difficult to have the opportunity to come into contact with it.

### In Shanghai

— Wu Baolin

For some reason, I had to come to Shanghai to continue my studies. Soon after, I received letters from several friends; some said that I was escaping reality, because the social environment in Shanghai was too bad, and that living in a state of ease under some protection, although there was an opportunity to study, my life might degenerate, and my mind would become numb. Others said that I was bravely facing reality, because although the environment in Shanghai was bad, only in adversity could one gain true knowledge and undertake important work.

These two opposing opinions gave me some thoughts: Talk, no matter how flowery, is ultimately empty. In fact, I think this is entirely a matter of "will," and not about whether society is good or bad. Indeed, there are too many temptations in Shanghai, and under the rule of some evil forces, the degree of darkness is simply unbelievable! The various material and spiritual oppressions make every person in the "isolated island" feel bored, painful, and decadent. Thus, they go to extremes, committing suicide. Some of them delve into the dark dead ends, shouting about boredom, and wine and women become their means of relieving boredom; but what lies before them is even more unwarranted darkness. Their "will" languishes in the darkness, because they suffer from severe "nearsightedness." They see the darkness before their eyes and conclude that it is eternal darkness. They do not see the bright side in the distance, and their will becomes a sacrifice to the darkness; the most pitiful thing is that they do not even know the word "brightness" until they die and are forever buried in darkness.

My experiences over the past six months have told me that "will" can overcome everything. Although the reality is so dark, this darkness certainly did not begin today. Doesn't past history tell us how many brilliant lights of ancient and modern times have been produced from darkness? Only in darkness do we feel the preciousness of light, have the determination to pursue light, and can produce brilliant light; and the only weapon to open up light is "will," to use a strong will to overcome all darkness, believing that light will come one day.

Recently, I replied to my friends like this:

"I am very ordinary, but I dare not live in ease under the protection of others. Although, strictly speaking, I do not have the courage to face reality directly, I am fortunate to have something to comfort myself with: that is, I have the opportunity to temper my 'will.' Although I am in the midst of darkness here, I have not forgotten to seize the bright side... I feel that this is a touchstone of 'will,' and I am very interested, because I will be able to know what my 'will' is like."

Shanghai is originally a touchstone of "will"!

### The Motherland is Advancing

— Shi Feng

Passing through gloomy days,

Treading a difficult journey,

Motherland! You shoulder a great mission,

To walk to the end of this long night.

True happiness for humanity is created by you,

The bright milestone for humanity is completed by you.

Advance, advance, advance!

The land of freedom beckons ahead:

Where the beautiful sunshine shines,

Where there is vitality and youth.

Passing through gloomy days,

Treading a difficult journey;

Motherland: The dawn has surged upon all fields,

Our steps advance with you!

Spring and Autumn

### Water Country Spring and Autumn

— (Fan Meng)

Originally, yellow plum season weather is sometimes sunny, sometimes rainy, and mold grows everywhere. At this time, everyone hates the "drip, drip, drip" of this weather. However, this year's plum season is very different from previous years. Sometimes it is "fine rain," and sometimes it is a "downpour." Looking at the torrential rain, one suddenly forgets that it is "plum rain." This abnormal phenomenon is a bit like a "thunderstorm" in the hot summer.

Wanting to see the scenery of the flood on the streets of Shanghai, I set off from Baker Road in the heavy rain, passed Ningbo Road, the New Kwong Theatre, walked along Guangxi Road, crossed Nanjing Road, passed Zhejiang Road, turned into Jiujiang Road, and then went to Nanjing Road through Yinghua Street.

The Kingdom of Rickshaws

The New Kwong Theatre is currently showing "Transfiguration Girl," but unexpectedly, a heavy rain opened a small river in front of the door, almost surrounding the New Kwong Theatre. It seems that business will be affected to some extent, right?

Going out through Guangxi Road, you can see the scene of the flood. On one side is the Sincere Company, and on the other side is the New World Company. Wooden boards are set up in front of both stores. Six or seven rickshaws are standing in the middle of the water. The water is up to their knees. This short distance, though less than thirty yards, is their "kingdom." They turn back and forth at the entrances of Sincere and New World. As long as there are well-dressed ladies and gentlemen who want to cross, they stretch out two fingers and say to you: "Twenty cents!" Although it hurts, looking at the heavy rain, you certainly don't want to sacrifice your shoes, socks, clothes, and pants to go into the water. So, you have to "sacrifice painfully."

Building a Yellow Mud Embankment

Going through Guangxi Road to Nanjing Road, in front of the pedestrian steps of the Sincere Company, the water is three or four inches deep. Cars are like boats traveling on land. The wheels fly over, and waves splash everywhere. In the heavy rain, the streetcars are filled with water in the tracks, and the speed is as slow as a wheelbarrow.

In the ditch in front of the Sincere Company, the muddy water of the Huangpu River is gushing upwards. There is a water pump, and three or four workers are doing the work of pumping water, but the heavy rain is pouring down. Pumping water on one side and raining on the other side is really of no avail.

Near the entrance of the Sincere Company at the intersection of Zhejiang Road, someone has built a small embankment three inches high with yellow mud, which looks like it wants to block the flood from entering the entrance of the Sincere Company. However, as soon as a car drives over this small embankment of rotten yellow mud, it immediately rushes out a piece of yellow water, and the small embankment of yellow mud three inches high is slowly eroding away.

A Child's World

Walking around the New Wing On Company, passing Tianyun Tower, the water here is four or five inches deep! As soon as the rickshaw drivers see the pedestrians hesitating, they immediately come over and ask you: "Want? Want?" Asking the price, just to cross over, costs ten cents.

Turning from Jiujiang Road into Yinghua Street, every alley on this road is filled with a foot of water. Many alley shops have become Venice's waterfront shops.

Seven or eight street urchins are gathered at the entrances of the Great Eastern Ballroom and the Wing On Company. When foreign gentlemen and ladies come out of the company, they immediately cleverly call for cars for them. When the car arrives, they help them walk from the long gangplank to sit in the car. Poked out through the glass window, there is at least a dime, and the children laugh when they get the money.

Today, Yinghua Street should be the world of these children.

Leaving Money for the Road

This business is naturally doing well. Before long, many "brokers" came to the entrance of the company. Although there were not so many cars, there were still many customers coming out of the company. Looking at the water in front of them, these "brokers" rushed to solicit business, carrying people from this side to the other. Two cents for a crossing. Except for the young ladies and grandmothers, the men were carried back and forth like children going to school.

Someone said: "This seems like leaving money for the road in martial arts novels."

### This Year's Xiangyun Yarn

— Xin Liang

Xiangyun yarn, also known as ge yarn, is produced in Guangzhou and other places. This year, all stores in the city are using inventory to meet the market demand.

Xiangyun yarn was launched when the weather began to get hot.

In these few days, as long as you go to the street to take a look, you will definitely find that all the silk shops and cloth shops are competing to sell Xiangyun yarn, and the clothes worn by men, women, old, and young are all Xiangyun yarn clothes. In the hot summer, in addition to various silks and fabrics, Xiangyun yarn can be said to be the most common and popular fabric.

The reason why Xiangyun yarn can be welcomed by so many people in society is, of course, because it has its reasons for being welcomed. First, it is easy to wash. When we wash Xiangyun yarn, we don't need leather soap like washing other fabrics, and we need thorough scrubbing. We only need to soak it in water, and after a while, we can take it to cool on a bamboo pole. Second, we have to talk about the color. In summer, most of the colors of general fabrics are white, but only this kind of Xiangyun yarn is black. Because it is dark, its second advantage can be said to be dirt-resistant and durable. Today, almost every family rarely does not have Xiangyun yarn clothes, and fashionable women have even worn a kind of Xiangyun yarn cheongsam; under this circumstance, the sales of Xiangyun yarn have also expanded to an amazing degree.

Speaking of Xiangyun yarn, its alias is Liang yarn, also called Pabu silk, which is a kind of silk fabric, and the warp and weft are all woven with raw silk. There is also so-called cooked Xiangyun yarn, which is woven with a mixture of raw and cooked silk. It is originally produced in Guangdong, especially in Guangzhou, Nanhai, Chencun... and other places around, which are simply the base camp of Xiangyun yarn. All the Xiangyun yarn on the Shanghai market is transported from there.

In Sanheli on Jiangxi Road and Qingyuanli on Beijing Road, we can see that they are full of signboards of Pabu silk shops. The most famous ones are Guangdelong, Heyulun, Guangyulun... and other shops. They mostly get their goods from Guangzhou, and then distribute them in batches to various cloth shops and silk shops in Shanghai. In previous years, their transactions in the summer solstice season alone can be said to be huge.

Since the war broke out, the major coastal cities have been ravaged one after another. As a result, Guangzhou, the base camp of Xiangyun yarn, has also fallen under the invaders' artillery fire. Due to the inconvenience of transportation and the interruption of the source, Shanghai's Xiangyun yarn has also been greatly affected this summer. Some families are only selling inventory, and some large stores are directly getting goods from Hong Kong, but because Hong Kong goods are more expensive than Guangdong goods in terms of cost and all expenses, the price of Xiangyun yarn in Shanghai this year is also not cheap.

"This year, the population of Shanghai has suddenly increased a lot, so the sales of Xiangyun yarn can be said to be quite good," a shop assistant in a cloth shop told me: "But its source is pitifully small, not even half of what it was in previous years."

"Now," the shop assistant continued to say to me: "We are all relying on inventory to do business. If these inventories are all sold out, we will have to watch helplessly as a good business cannot be done."

### Burning Red Pine Forest

— Qi Hua

Romance of The Redwoods

Produced by Columbia Pictures, Showing at the Grand Shanghai Theatre

"Burning Red Pine Forest" is the original work of Jack London brought to the screen. Through a romance, he cleverly wrote about the sincere friendship of mankind, and that labor and capital should work hand in hand closely. Although Blake and Malone are rivals in love, when fighting, they even want to put each other to death, but when there is a danger at work, they abandon their personal interests and go to rescue each other's lives. The capitalists only know how to seek profit, and are unwilling to repair the old machines. The lives of the workers are sacrificed as a result. Although Blake witnessed the tragedy, and madly destroyed the machine, when the factory owner was caught in the burning forest, he still risked guiding them out of danger.

The director, Erfan, was unable to firmly grasp the center of gravity of these two aspects. For example, Malone took away Blake's lover. After the fight, he did not effectively connect their friendship. Also, the factory owner's failure to repair the machine, etc., was only filled in Blake's anger after Malone's death. These are the two biggest flaws in the film, so that the scene after Malone's death seems very stiff.

The scene where Blake and others reported Malone's death to Lanehen, who was about to be a bride. He only wrote about Blake's anger, and ignored Lanehen. What was handled better was Blake's being neglected by his companions, which prompted him to decide to leave. For example, when Blake was eating, no one helped him get a salt bottle, and no one accepted the potatoes he sent over. So he let go of his beloved little animal, and prepared to slip away. In many subtle actions, Blake's emotions were written very delicately.

The final forest fire, of course, cannot be compared with "Chicago Fire Record." Many pictures show that the fire and the forest are separated. Blake rushed into the forest through the fire, and drove away quickly in a car. It can also be seen that there are gaps isolated in the middle of the fire. However, the editing is still quite compact, and with the help of color, it can add to the tense atmosphere.

Charles Bickford's Blake is the best performance. He is very able to grasp the character of this role. Joan Pike failed in both the scene where she received the news of Malone's death and the scene where she persuaded Blake.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Episode 13: Advising on Learning Agriculture, Storing Materials for the Country; Keeping the Strong and Eliminating the Weak, Selecting Seeds in the Field

After looking at the silkworm rearing room, they also looked at the room where they stored the silkworm rearing tools. There were quite a few various tools. During the silkworm rearing season, nothing was missing. When not rearing silkworms, they were all stored away. When storing, they must be disinfected one by one, and when they are taken out for use, they must also be disinfected one by one. On the east side of the silkworm rearing hall, there is a building, Jianmingxuan Factory, which was newly built not long ago. The most important thing there is the seed selection chamber. Almost every silkworm egg must be inspected, saving the good ones and eliminating the bad ones. In humans, it is called eugenics, selecting seeds and keeping the good ones. Isn't it the same in silkworms? This group of sericulture experts are doing the work of this eugenics. Not to mention silkworms, since the end of the war in our country, many scholars have advocated eugenics. Because China was originally the most populous country, and after recuperation, the population will increase even more. There are also many inferior seeds among the Chinese people. It is better to find ways to eliminate them, and then keep the good and eliminate the bad, and preserve excellent seeds. However, our ruling class and research scholars do not agree with this statement. They say: Our nation is not inferior, not weak. It was shown in the last war. Although at this time, there are also many bad elements who have become scourges, that is due to the underdevelopment of education and the social environment. However, those people are still a minority among minorities. Only those aggressors, dictators, the so-called fascists of the past, used the theory of eugenics to make arbitrary decisions. They thought that only their race was the best, and other races should be eliminated. Naturally, human beings are not uniform, there are intelligent and foolish, strong and weak, but the foolish can be made intelligent, as long as there is education; the weak can be made strong, as long as there is health. Our Chinese god is a broad-minded and benevolent great nation, and has never adopted this kind of tragic and narrow attitude. Let's not be verbose, we want to say that at this moment, Director Ge led them to the seed selection chamber. All the people doing seed selection work were young women. On each person's table, there was a microscope, a green magnetic-shaded electric lamp, and they were all working carefully. Director Ge introduced a lady with a graceful beard and two deep dimples on her face when she smiled, and said: "This is Ms. Li, the director of our seed selection department." Ms. Li quickly stood up to greet her. Before Director Ge could say that this was Village Chief Zhu, seeing an old man with white hair and sleeves fluttering, with only one arm, she knew that this was Village Chief Zhu. Director Ge also introduced two Miss Zhus and two Miss Hes. Ms. Li had long heard of the name of Zhu Airen, and said: "Dr. Zhu is very busy with medical affairs, it's rare for you to come!" (152)

### The Life of a Towel Weaving Girl

— Guo Tianzhong

Because of my job, I am with towel weaving girls every day, so I know that they sit in the towel machine all day, burying their heads and weaving towels. Life is quite hard!

The towel weaving girls are all provided with accommodation by the factory, and the factory handles the meals on their behalf. Therefore, they get up to work every day from 5:00 or 4:30 in the morning, and work until 10:00 in the evening before resting. In addition to three meals a day, there is simply no moment to rest. After they finish work at night, they still have their private lives, such as washing clothes and bathing, and they are very busy. They can only sleep at 12:00 every night.

A girl's output can be four dozen or more towels a day at most, three dozen on average, and only one dozen for those who are slow. If there are weavers who are faster, in addition to their wages, they can get a little bonus. The bonus is divided into three cents, five cents, and even three yuan.

The wages for weaving towels are calculated by the piece. The wage for each towel is about 1.5 cents in national currency. Wages are calculated every half month. A girl who works quickly can earn twelve or thirteen yuan after deducting food expenses. The average can earn ten yuan or eight or nine yuan. A girl who works slowly can also have an income of five or six yuan. However, this is a very small number. Girls who are slow at work on weekdays will not only have less wage income, but also be suspended by the factory. Therefore, on average, each girl can earn about twenty yuan a month.

### The Recent Situation of the Quintuplet Sisters

— Hua Zhi

The world-famous Canadian quintuplet girls, namely Yvonne, Annette, Cecile, Emilie, and Marie, have increased in value a hundredfold since they saw the King and Queen of England last month. European and American newspapers headlined on the front page, "Quintuplet Girls Kiss the Queen of England, Not Shy at All" "The Girl Played with the Buttons on the British Emperor's Naval Uniform," as breaking news. The following are some interesting facts about them recently:

Growing Fatter

The five girls will be exactly five years old as of May 28 of this year. When they were born, the five children weighed a total of thirteen pounds and six ounces, and each was twelve inches long. Now they weigh more than two hundred and twenty pounds in total, and average forty-three inches in length. The speed of their development is praised by their nurse, Dr. Dafoe. Recently, they took a train to London to see the King, traveling seven or eight hundred miles, and did not suffer at all.

Greedy and Lazy

According to the nurses, the five girls are only greedy and send everything they grab into their mouths, which is very troublesome. Recently, they have been allowed to eat ice cream, but candy is still not suitable. Because they had a serious illness last winter, and two of them almost died, and their mouths still can't open very wide. The time for public viewing is only a short period from 10:00 to 10:30 in the morning every day. In summer, it is possible to add another time in the afternoon, but since the opening of the New York World's Fair, tourists from all over the world have gathered there, and only two or three hundred people visit the girls every day. Ticket revenue has been greatly reduced.

Firing the Doctor

The so-called Dr. Dafoe has been the nurse of the five girls since they were born. However, the Canadian "French Language Society" has recently proposed to dismiss this doctor. One of the reasons is that he is an infidel, which is different from the five girls who have always believed in Catholicism, and he loves to speak English and does not know French, which has a great impact on the future of the five girls. The girls' parents also felt that Dr. Dafoe was acting on his own, allowing the five girls to shoot movies, make advertisements, and broadcast, seeking personal gain in private. Therefore, they decided to move out of Dafoe Hospital and take back "self-management" soon.

Insuring Teeth

Many people who have little to do with the five girls are also busy every day. For example, the Canadian government's Ministry of Education is carefully considering how to let them go to school to study. Dr. Mesen, the director of the Dental Graduate School of London University, recently submitted a report to the Dental Association, saying that he has been focusing on the teeth of these girls for the past three years. The result is that the teeth of these girls are developing healthily and are unmatched in the world. I dare to guarantee that their mothers need not step into a tooth extraction hospital.

### Recent News from the Peking Opera Scene in the Former Capital

— Yan Yan

Since Hou Yulan of the Zhongxin Society, known for its famous beards, followed Yan Jupeng to Shanghai to perform the "Golden Drama", the role of Qingyi has been vacant. Recently, there are plans to invite Jin Heming to join the performance, and it is said that the matter has been negotiated.

Shang Xiaoyun, one of the four famous Dan performers, is famous in the opera world for his hard work. He does not take a summer break even during the hot summer. It is said that he has decided not to take a summer break this year, but to change to performing one night a week, in order to maintain the livelihood of the poor opera troupe.

Wu Sheng (male martial role) Sun Yukun has made a comeback. Due to the Lianxian troupe's successful performances, Yang-style plays such as "Changban Slope" and "Yanyang Tower" will be rehearsed successively.

Zhang Eyun was unable to perform in Tianjin, and there is news that she will come to Peiping (Beijing) soon. After Yang Baosen comes to Peiping, he will cooperate with Zhang Eyun for a long time. Ma Sili has also returned to Peiping from Tianjin.

Since Song Dezhu formed the Yingguang Society to perform, the results have been mediocre. Now it has been reorganized for the second time to strengthen the lineup. Although there is talk of going to Shanghai, it is still too early.

Li Wanchun went to Harbin to perform at the Central Theater, and Li Shaochun went to Harbin to perform at the Huale Theater. The two sides will perform competing shows. "Eighteen Arhats Fighting Wukong" and "Eighteen Arhats Subduing the Demon" will also be performed against each other in Harbin.

The weather in Peiping is not good, and many famous actors are suffering from colds. Among them, one "bearded man" is particularly serious. First, Tan Fuying, then Xi Xiaobo, and then Yan Jupeng, who went to Shanghai, fell ill one after another. A few days ago, Kun Ling Xu Dongming, who plays male roles, also returned to the theater due to illness. It is truly a rare coincidence.

### Mary Pickford

— Gu Buwen

Returning to the Silver Screen — Changing Her Style

Charlie Chaplin's unsteady, twisted, and contorted walk on the screen has left an immortal impression on everyone. Mary Pickford also gives people a similarly profound impression. Twenty years ago, she was a unique silver screen lover. At that time, she was in her youthful years, naturally gifted, with delicate expressions and overflowing youth. Because of her dedication to art and her enterprising spirit, she has been affected by the changing times and the competition of many stars, and she laments that her youth is gradually fading, and she has become outdated. Her graceful figure and youthful appearance are hard to maintain, so in her thirties, she was forced to consider the age issue on the screen, which had an impact.

She has performed in "Kiki", "Secrets" and a few other films, which have not been subjected to the carping of film critics and cannot be regarded as failures, but she has never continued to perform, which shows that she is hiding her clumsiness and has no intention of moving forward. Afterwards, rumors of her comeback often arise, but after many years, they have not been realized. It turns out that she has devoted herself to the business of film production, which is very suitable for her temperament.

She and Jesse Lasky formed a film production company that was completely independent, and she served as the director, and she has produced three films. Unfortunately, it was not very successful, so the company stopped immediately.

Currently, there is new news that Mary Pickford will return to the screen, which is very popular. It is said that she will play Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Christian Science Church. Therefore, the outside world has learned that Mary Pickford has recently seriously changed her style and turned to basic faith issues. After she returns to the screen, it is predicted that if she continues to struggle with this kind of subject matter, she will surely be able to regain the cold welcome of the public.

### Joy and Suffering (3)

——Writing Some Experiences and Thoughts from the Industry

(3) The Difficulty of Costume Dramas In this period, I have successively filmed several costume dramas – "Diao Chan", "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian", "Wu Zetian", etc. Many people ask about "How do costume dramas compare to modern dramas?" My feeling is that: performing in costume dramas is more interesting, and performing in costume dramas is more concealable of clumsiness. Characters like Diao Chan and Pan Jinlian have already left a deep impression in old novels, and the plot is very tortuous and wonderful; performing the role feels particularly exciting. Regarding performance, modern dramas must strive for naturalness, and excessive imitation of Western films is not very good, which is inevitably very restrictive; the actions in costume dramas are "done with intent" without accurate targets, and everything is surreal, which feels much broader to perform, as long as it is generally acceptable, it will probably not be as easily criticized as modern dramas. However, precisely because there is no accurate target, this "doing with intent" also has more difficulties; therefore, in addition to carefully studying the book and script in terms of personality, I also purchased many picture albums of ancient beauties and various statues, which were displayed in the bedroom for observation; although this is a rather childish and ridiculous behavior, it also provides some objects, and in fact it is always somewhat helpful.

There is another difficulty in performing in costume dramas, regarding clothing: for the role of Wu Zetian, the hair was tightly bound with a hair set on her head, and her body was like an actor singing Peking opera. First, she had to wear a thick cotton vest with wide shoulders, and then add a robe, a brocade dragon robe, and two skirts below. The weight of the whole set and decorations is probably more than ten catties, and the whole body seems to be pressed down straight, and walking also loses its freedom. It is an even greater hardship to film in the summer.

(4) A Comparative View of Joy and Suffering Filming is really a troublesome thing. However, to be dedicated to a meaningful struggle for a career, it is essential to have the spirit of enduring hardship and hard work; in other words, it is often the necessary process of enjoying it and reaching the realm of success. In the studio, sometimes performing a few very satisfying good scenes, I feel infinitely excited, but it is just some joy of self-satisfaction. The greatest pleasure that can be gained in the spirit is: after the new film is released, the reviews are good and the box office is good, then you are really full of joy, indescribably happy, and feel more pleasure.

However, the measurement of this joy and suffering is actually just a comparison of one to nine, and only one-tenth of the harvest of joy is such a difficult thing to ask for? (End)

### A Week in the Film World

— Yinyi

Yihua's large-scale costume film "Wang Baochuan" has already started filming. The actors have been decided as Li Ying as Xue Pinggui and Diao Banhua as Princess Daizhan. However, the role of Wang Baochuan has not been completely finalized.

Wang Yin's directorial debut "Desperate Gambler" was once planned to be renamed "New Fugitive", but Wang Yin disliked it for being too suggestive, so the film title has not yet been officially decided. Someone suggested the title "Lovebirds in the Devil's Den" for him, which is still under consideration.

Long Qiuxia has joined Huaxin Film Studio and has signed a contract for several films. The first film is Xu Xinfu's second Chen Charles mystery case "The Flying Corpse of Lanmin".

Shao Zuiweng is staying in Shanghai and has no intention of going to Hong Kong. Shao plans to restore Tianyi Company and is asking Datong Studio for the same house, and Datong is looking for a new location.

Chen Yiqing's comedy will be released at the Jincheng Grand Theater after "Li Sanniang". This film stars Han Langen, Liu Jichuan, Yin Xiucen, and Bai Hong.

Pina Bena wears a gypsy-style outfit in Paramount's new film "Man about Town", which is said to be the most popular fashion this year.

### Zhang Shankun is Really Becoming a Director "One Night Queen" Listed as His Debut

— Yin Di

The Story of "Meilong Town" Brought to the Screen Waiting for Chen Yunshang to Come to Shanghai to Star in This Film

When Wang Cilong was directing "Night Rain in Manjiang" for Xinhua Company, Zhang Shankun had a plan to direct the film himself. The planned Cast was named "Zhang Shankun and Wang Cilong Joint Directors", but finally because Zhang was too busy, the plan was not realized, and "Night Rain in Manjiang" was still directed by Wang Cilong alone.

Now, however, Zhang's own direction has been conceived and materialized. Initially, he was preparing to direct "Spring Colors of the Palace", but now "Spring Colors of the Palace" has been temporarily shelved, and "One Night Queen" will be filmed first. The story is adapted from the Peking opera "Meilong Town". The script is being rushed by Chen Dubei, and Zhang is preparing to use this film as his trial directorial work, and has designated Chen Yunshang and Mei Tai to star. Chen Yunshang's performance of the delicate and silly expression of a young girl in "Fairy Yunshang" was unexpectedly successful. In "One Night Queen", playing a waitress - Li Fengjie, a humorous performance can be imagined that she will definitely be able to make people intoxicated.

In addition, Zhang Shankun is also preparing to direct "The Creation of Heaven and Earth" himself, with Fang Peilin assisting him, and the heroine is probably Chen Yunshang.

### Anecdotes from the Peking Opera World

— Xu Muyun

Film Companies Should Invite Shang Heyu to Make Films

In the North, there is a Zhu Xiaocai, who is proficient in both Kun and Luan operas, and is also a disciple of Heyu. His artistic skills are indeed above Han Lin, and he has followed Lao Shang for a long time. Sometimes when Lao Shang takes a long rest, Xiaocai joins Han Shichang, Bai Yunsheng, and Gao Yang's Kunyi troupe. This person's skills are exceptionally agile, and short fights are even better than long armor, as if he has never been to the South. This time Lao Shang is coming to Shanghai, I wonder if he will come with him.

In the early years of the Republic of China, when talking about the Yu school of martial artists in Peiping, Yang, Shang, and Yu (Yuting) were always mentioned together. Later, Lao Shang realized that both Yang and Yu had considerable foundations, and at the same time, their seniors Yang Yuelou and Yu Jusheng were all people in the Peking opera world, and regardless of age or status, they all had friendships and relationships with both families. As for those who had a master-disciple relationship, they were even more numerous. Therefore, Lao Shang decided to leave Peiping, and was willing to be subordinate to the Huang school of martial artist Li Jiru (who was actually just a hollow name). Sometimes he assigned him an unimportant supporting role, and he had no objection. At that time, because he had no place to use his talents, even Gao Fuan's reputation was above him and much louder than him. In the past ten years, after Gao died and Li retired, he returned to the old capital. Coincidentally, Mei Lanfang's troupe lacked a martial artist (at first, Li Wanchun was mostly used), so he invited Lao Shang to cooperate. At that time, few people sang the full version of "Universe Peak", often only performing the two scenes of "Feigning Madness in the Golden Palace", so the name of the play was often confused. In the restaurants, nineteen out of ten wrote "Universe Madness", but in fact these three characters are very incomprehensible. When Lanfang arranged the full version of "Universe Peak", with Shang as the marshal and Feng Qing as Kuang Hong, starting from Qin Ershi's imperial gift of the Universe Peak to Kuang Hong, and then with Heyu using his position as Prince and Yuan Shi to plead for the Kuang family, and with many fights, the audience realized that "Universe Peak" was originally the name of a precious sword, and the "madness" in the "Feigning Madness in the Golden Palace" should never be confused with the character "peak". In the past, when I saw the miswriting of "Universe Madness", I simply suspected that the universe was going crazy, which was very ridiculous. People say that Lanfang's troupe is very good at promoting people, and there is a considerable reason for this. Take Ershun for example. He had no great name before, and even Zhang Wenbin was louder than him. Once he joined the Mei Theater, everyone knew Xiao Changhua's name. Lao Shang certainly appreciated Dr. Mei's kindness in taking care of him for ten years, but if his skills were not authentic and truly amazing, even if the person who promoted him was more famous, it would be useless.
