### Hua Army Recaptures Xiangyin County Seat; Fierce Fighting on the North Bank of the Miluo River; Japanese Forces on the South Bank, Except for Ying Tian and Xin Shi, Completely Eliminated; Several Japanese Divisions Encircled in the Mufu Mountains, Facing Starvation

Changsha: The Hua army, having captured Jinjing this morning, advanced victoriously northward and recaptured Jiangpu (west of Pingjiang County) at 1 PM this afternoon. Simultaneously, another unit of the Hua army captured Shapu (north of Fulinpu), and Hua guerrilla forces, taking advantage of Japanese unpreparedness, captured Xiangyin County at dawn on the 4th.

Changsha: The Hua army in the Xiang region has been advancing continuously for days. After eliminating and routing the Japanese forces in the areas of Shangshih City, Qiaotouyi, and Fulinpu, the Hua army is now engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese forces in the area north of the Miluo River. (Telegram, 3 PM, 4th)

Changde: The battle on the outskirts of Changsha is about to come to an end. The Japanese forces that crossed the Miluo River southward along the railway and highway lines have been routed after the Hua army’s continuous suppression efforts over the past ten days. They are retreating in disarray towards the north bank of the Miluo River. Strongholds such as Shangshih City, Qiaotouyi, and Guanlinpu have been retaken by the Hua army in recent days. The Japanese forces in Jinjing have also been eliminated. The Hua army, except for a part encircling and annihilating the remaining Japanese forces entrenched in Ying Tian, is mostly clearing the battlefield along the Miluo River and pursuing northward in separate routes. According to reports, this battle was launched when Itagaki of West Kun came to China to take command. His intention seemed to be to gather the main forces in central China to take Changsha in one fell swoop, threatening Zhuzhou and Hengyang. However, through the calm command of Hua military officers and the fierce attacks of loyal and brave soldiers, not only is Greater Changsha still safe, but many Japanese cemeteries have been built north and south of the Miluo River. The Japanese situation has become like the withered leaves of late autumn, and its decline is becoming increasingly obvious. (Telegram, 3 PM, 4th)

Chongqing: Today, this city received military news from the Hua side in Changsha stating that several Japanese divisions are currently encircled in the Mufu Mountains in northeastern Hunan province, and their food supplies are only sufficient for five days. Yesterday morning, the Hua army recaptured Fulinpu, a crucial village northeast of Changsha. A unit of Japanese forces that had infiltrated the mountains between Xiushui (transliteration) and Tonggu, attempting to encircle Changsha from the southeast, is now encircled on three sides, north, south, and east, by the Hua army. The fate of Changsha may be decided by the battle currently taking place in the Mufu Mountains. (Reuters telegram, 4th)

Fulinpu: The war situation in northern Hunan is indeed turning in favor of the Hua. Most of the remaining Japanese forces on the south bank of the Miluo River have been encircled and annihilated by the Hua army. As of Shen time on the 4th, only a few strongholds, such as Xinshi, Miluo, and Ying Tian, still have some remaining Japanese forces holding out for reinforcements. The Hua army is sending powerful units to search and advance. The thousand-strong Japanese forces entrenched in Qiaotouyi have had their supply lines cut off, and it should not be difficult for the Hua to annihilate them all within days. (Telegram, 4th)

Changsha: Jinjing (east of Fulinpu) on the Xiang-E Highway has also been recaptured. There were originally over a thousand Japanese soldiers stationed there. After Fulinpu and Liqiao were successively captured by the Hua army, the Japanese forces in Jinjing felt increasingly isolated. Yesterday, the Hua army launched a pincer attack and annihilated most of them. The Hua army then recovered the stronghold on the morning of the 4th. In recent days, the Japanese forces invading southwards have been forced to retreat northwards. The Hua army is pursuing swiftly, with the vanguard already approaching Bijimiao, and a part has crossed the north bank, intercepting the retreating Japanese forces. Japanese corpses are scattered all over the fields, and the Hua army has seized countless war spoils. (Telegram, 4th)

Chongqing: According to Chinese military authorities, some of the soldiers currently fighting on the outskirts of Changsha are farmers from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces who only started training after the fall of Wuhan last winter. In the past few days, thanks to the loyal and brave resistance of these men and other troops, Changsha, which was already in a dangerous situation, has turned from danger to safety. According to Chinese military authorities, the residents of Changsha and all public and private institutions and materials have been evacuated. Therefore, even if the Japanese forces were to capture Changsha, it would have no military value. Useful houses have been burned by the Hua side, and telegraph and telephone lines, as well as all kinds of scrap iron and wooden pillars, have been transported away. The bridges in Changsha have all been demolished, and the Yuehan railway tracks have been dismantled to several miles south of Changsha. Therefore, even if the Japanese forces were to capture Changsha, they would gain nothing. (Associated Press telegram, 4th)

Foreigners in the Kaifeng area claim that a small number of Japanese troops and a large number of puppet troops are stationed in Bian City.

### No Red Army in Xinjiang

Chongqing: Regarding the news from foreign sources in Shanghai that Soviet troops have entered Xinjiang, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here has no knowledge of it.

### The Situation in the Balkans

The European war has been raging for only a little over a month, but the Soviet Union's power in Europe has already seen astonishing growth: it has annexed a large part of Poland's territory, Estonia has become its protectorate, and it is said that Lithuania, Latvia, Finland, and other countries will successively fall within its sphere of influence. At the same time, it is also encircling the Balkan Peninsula, which is known as the world's powder keg. Recently, the foreign ministers of Turkey and Romania successively visited Moscow. It is said that Turkey proposed the formation of an expanded Balkan consultation group to maintain genuine neutrality. This proposal was even supported by Yugoslavia, which has never had diplomatic relations with the Soviet government. Although there are rumors of an impending initial signing of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey, which will slightly affect Soviet ambitions, the Soviet Union has not abandoned its designs on the Balkans. Moreover, in the current situation, the Soviet Union has not adopted a hostile attitude towards Britain and France, and Britain and France, for wartime interests, are naturally unwilling to interfere with Soviet activities in the Balkans. It goes without saying that Germany is trying to please the Soviet Union. The military strength of other countries such as Romania and Bulgaria is definitely not enough to compete with the Soviet Union, and it will not be difficult to yield with a little pressure from the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is highly likely that the Soviet Union will try to create a new situation in the Balkans.

In the past, the Balkans were the breeding ground for world wars. It has extremely complex ethnic relations, which have often been exploited by the great powers to expand their economic and political influence. Especially because of its geographical location in the heart of the Mediterranean, it is a very important military stronghold; for the Eurasian continent, it is also the main transportation hub. For these reasons, the great powers each have the ambition to possess it. Since Germany annexed Czechoslovakia and Austria, it would be most convenient to invade the Balkans. However, now, in order to stabilize the rear, Germany had to give up this opportunity. Moreover, due to international maneuvering, it also wants to promote the Soviet Union's ambition in the Balkans. The key is not only to win over allies during the war or to support the so-called peace offensive, but also to use this to cause direct and lasting contradictions between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, forcing the Soviet Union to stand on the same line as Germany against Britain and France. Because if the Balkans were controlled by the Soviet Union like the Baltic coast, it would affect military operations in the Mediterranean during wartime; even in peacetime, it would affect land and water transportation between Europe and Asia, and could threaten the colonies of Britain and France. Therefore, if the Soviet Union controls the Balkans, it will make Britain and France restless, and eventually absolutely intolerable. So far, the Balkan issue is still brewing, and has not yet been launched; but the side-by-side contest is already undeniable. For example, the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey is directly related to the passage of British and French warships through the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits; and the Soviet Union's hope to cooperate with Turkey is nothing more than hoping to maintain the absolute neutrality of the two straits. This so-called neutrality is aimed at Britain and France sealing off the two straits!

Germany's strategy is to please the Soviet Union, forcing it onto a battle line, so that it has no choice but to take the same actions as Germany. However, on the other hand, it also affects the interests of Italy, another Axis power. Italy and the Balkans do have close relations. Since Italy occupied Albania, in addition to stepping up its political relations with Yugoslavia, it has also been actively involved in Greece and Bulgaria; this is an expansion in the front, and on the reverse is an attempt to prevent the extension of Pan-Germanism and Pan-Slavism. If the Soviet Union controls the Balkans, this will not only shatter Italy's hope of developing towards Eastern Europe, affect the Adriatic Sea, which Italy regards as an inland sea, but also make Italy directly feel the threat of a strong neighbor, causing both losses and danger. This is why Italian Foreign Minister Ciano accepted Hitler's invitation to go to Berlin. On the surface, it was for a peace offensive, but at least the disposition of the Balkans was what Italy was eager to clarify. It can be said that what Italy is most concerned about at present is nothing more than the status and rights of the Balkans.

The new situation in the Balkans is now developing. How it will change is difficult to predict at present; but Germany pulled the Soviet Union to issue a statement, hoping to seek peace based on the established facts. Britain has already resolutely rejected this through Prime Minister Chamberlain in Parliament. Last night, a dispatch from Rome stated that Italy is unwilling to mediate peace talks at this time. The hope of a sudden turn in the European war has become a clear trend. The extension of time will inevitably lead to the expansion of space. In our observation, when the flames extend to the Balkan Peninsula, it will become an important stage in the sudden expansion of the war!

### Germany's Policy on the European Situation: Hitler to Announce Policy at Week's End; Mussolini Denies Plans to Launch Peace Movement; Daladier Scheduled to Clarify France's Position Today

The Hague: The "Telegraph" recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that Führer Hitler will convene the Reichstag on the 6th of this month to announce his policy on the European situation. French Premier Daladier is scheduled to deliver a speech tomorrow. Its content will definitely be closely watched by Führer Hitler. In addition, after Italian Foreign Minister Ciano returns home, he will immediately attend the State Council to report on his talks with Führer Hitler. The decision of the State Council is still unknown, but it is said that the suggestions of Führer Hitler will be conveyed to the British government through diplomatic channels today. (Havas, 4th)

Berlin: The German official news agency received a dispatch from Rome today stating that Italian authorities have denied rumors that Mussolini is currently studying a peace conference plan, calling it unfounded, and saying that Italy will not take such an initiative in the current environment. (Reuters, 4th)

London: Rumors are circulating that the British government has received a document from Rome containing peace proposals. Official sources here have firmly denied this. (Havas, 4th)

Paris: There are many rumors about Führer Hitler's upcoming peace offensive. Responsible officials here have stated that the British and French governments have not received any suggestions. Although Hitler has tried to persuade certain neutral countries to act as mediators, it seems that they have all declined. Therefore, Hitler probably no longer hopes to submit a concrete plan to Britain and France through neutral countries, but will only state it when he delivers a speech in the Reichstag. If so, then Britain and France do not have to regard it as a direct or formal proposal from the German government, and the response to it will naturally be simpler. (Havas, 4th)

Berlin: German political figures believe that Führer Hitler will deliver a speech to the Reichstag at the end of this week, discussing the military and political results after the Polish war. Now that the Polish war has ended, Berlin political figures say that Germany will exert efforts on political and diplomatic activities in the coming days to determine whether the Central Powers want to engage in war or restore peace. Berlin sources point out that although there are widespread rumors that Germany has no intention of "Germanizing" Poland, nor of ruling Poland by "force," it should be known that Poland was originally a country comprising several ethnic minorities, with Poles accounting for only half of the total population. To forcibly unite the various ethnic groups would be a violation of the principle of national self-determination. (Haitong, 4th)

Berlin: Today, a certain high-ranking official of the German Foreign Ministry stated that Chamberlain's speech did not provide a clear and incisive answer to our political debate on the issue of war and peace. Authoritative sources here solemnly stated that Germany's attitude towards the current situation was clearly expressed weeks ago. In a nutshell, Germany's wish is for peace. Therefore, there is no need for Germany to issue special peace proposals. Führer Hitler will deliver a speech in the Reichstag this weekend. The German side's opinions on the situation, which have not yet been expressed, will be delivered by Hitler himself. German authoritative sources say that the Foreign Ministry does not intend to take any action before the Führer delivers his speech. (Haitong, 4th)

Paris: Judging from the news received here after Italian Foreign Minister Ciano returned to Rome from Berlin, Hitler's peace offensive will be launched in an extremely clever manner, which at first glance will make people think it is acceptable. Representatives of neutral countries will present Hitler's attempt to seek peace in the form of a victory belonging to democratic countries. The fait accompli of Poland will be "explained" in a way that appears not to contradict the victory of Britain and France. However, news from Rome says that well-informed Italian sources predict that the Italian government will not immediately launch any peace movement, as Italy is unlikely to devote itself to a futile action that has no hope of success in the current situation. Italians admit that it is difficult to imagine that Germany's peace proposals can be accepted by Britain and France. (Reuters, 4th)

Berlin: Nazi Party sources stated last night that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, while in Berlin, jointly studied the possibility of European peace with the German side. Germany expressed its gratitude to Italy for maintaining its friendship with Germany in the prolongation of the war. The cooperative power of the Berlin-Rome Axis will become stronger in the future.

### French Cabinet Meeting: Premier Attends to Report on Military and Diplomatic Situation

Paris: The cabinet held a State Council meeting at 10:00 this morning, which ended at 12:15. Premier Daladier immediately reported on the diplomatic and military situation. Its content has not been published, but according to reliable sources, Daladier not only expressed his approval of the firm statement made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons yesterday, but also reiterated that Britain and France have a completely consistent understanding of the peace offensive that Germany may take diplomatically, militarily, and economically. If Germany formally puts forward peace proposals, Britain and France will exchange views in order to take a common countermeasure. In addition, Premier Daladier is scheduled to attend the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon to deliver a speech and report on the current situation. In short, Premier Daladier's repeated statements have been unanimously supported by the country. This statement regarding Germany's peace offensive will also be approved by the British government. In other words, any peace proposal that is based on the fait accompli created by German aggression, or is guaranteed by Führer Hitler's empty words, will be rejected by the Central Powers.

London: Moscow Radio last night admitted that although Warsaw has fallen, Polish forces continue to resist Soviet and German aggression. "Polish guerrillas" are attacking behind the Soviet troops, especially near Pinsk. Polish guerrillas are "desperately attacking Soviet troops and supply teams," and the announcement admits the difficulty of eliminating the guerrillas, because they are hiding in the eastern swamps. The Soviet Union is working to clear the Polish guerrillas in the swampy areas to prevent future troubles. (Associated Press, 4th)

On the western front, the battle situation was calm, with only some artillery battles in the Saarbrücken area. In terms of economic warfare, 72 merchant ships have been intercepted since September 30. Some merchant ships were forced to enter German ports because they were transporting contraband. (Haitong, 4th)

Berlin: It was announced here that a grand German military review will be held tomorrow in the suburbs of Warsaw to commemorate the end of the Polish war. Important German military and political figures will participate in the parade. (Haitong, 4th)

### Soviet Union Actively Expanding Power: Moscow's Diplomatic Activities; Mutual Assistance Treaties Agreed with Lithuania and Latvia; Baltic Sea Gates Completely Controlled

Berlin: According to the German news agency, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys arrived in Moscow today. Urbšys's trip is related to the reported Soviet desire to conclude a mutual assistance or non-aggression treaty with Lithuania. (Reuters, 3rd)

Moscow: Molotov and Lithuanian Foreign Minister Urbšys held talks last night. Stalin, Potemkin, Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Lithuania Pozdnyakov, and Lithuanian Minister to the Soviet Union Nakevičius were all present. The two sides had a cordial conversation for more than two hours. (TASS, 4th)

Kaunas: Foreign Minister Urbšys returned here by plane from Moscow this morning. He will immediately report to the government on his talks with the Soviet authorities and listen to instructions before returning to Moscow. (Havas, 4th)

Tallinn: The Soviet military delegation recently arrived here and will immediately discuss the establishment of land and sea military bases in Estonia in accordance with the mutual assistance treaty recently concluded between Estonia and the Soviet Union. It is reported that the Soviet Union intends to build fortifications on the southeastern coast of the island of Vormsi in Estonia and on the northern coast of the island of Hiiumaa, so as to control the port of Riga (Latvia) and the Gulf of Finland. (Havas, 3rd)

Moscow: Pravda published an article today discussing the status of Estonia, stating, "Estonia is strategically important due to its geographical location and has always been coveted by imperialist countries attempting to expand their economic and political spheres of influence. In 1919, the British Navy used it as a base to attack Kronstadt, resulting in the loss of 21 ships and a humiliating retreat. Britain attached particular importance to the Moonsund Islands and negotiated with Estonia to purchase Vormsi Island among them, hoping to establish its naval base in the Baltic Sea there. After the war, the British Navy sailed to Estonian waters every summer. All of this is extremely noteworthy. Since the signing of the Soviet-Estonian Mutual Assistance Pact, the Soviet Union has obtained the right to establish several naval bases and airfields in Vormsi Island, Hiiumaa Island, and Paldiski Town. From then on, the possibility of using Estonia as a base for operations against the Soviet Union has been eliminated. This pact has greatly changed the balance of power in the Baltic Sea. The possibility of the Red Banner Baltic Fleet protecting the safety of the Soviet Union's sea borders has been greatly increased, and at the same time, Estonia itself has been further guaranteed." (TASS, [date])

Moscow: Regarding the issue of Romania's Bessarabia province (which belonged to Russia before the last European war), it is widely rumored here this morning that the Soviet Union will immediately make a request to the Romanian government.

### Results of Soviet-Turkish Negotiations of Deep Concern to Britain: Turkish Foreign Minister Remains in Soviet Capital Awaiting Instructions; Soviet-Bulgarian Negotiations to Conclude Broad Commercial Treaty

Moscow: Well-informed sources here recently stated that Turkey intends to provide guarantees to the Soviet government that it will strictly adhere to neutrality in the current European war, even if the Soviet Union and Italy are involved in the war. Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu will stay in Moscow for four or five more days to await instructions from his government. (Havas, 4th)

Milan: According to the Popolo d'Italia, British political circles are extremely concerned about the Soviet-Turkish negotiations. Reports from Moscow have even caused consternation among the British. Even the most optimistic British people must now admit that the extension of the Moscow negotiations shows that the Soviet Union has not yet made its final statement. The Soviet Union may force Turkey to adopt strict neutrality. In other words, the Dardanelles Strait (the translator refers to the gateway to the Black Sea) is determined to be closed, and a neutral group with real strength will be established. Britain's plan to encircle Germany will be overthrown. (Haitong, 4th)

London: The Turkish military delegation arrived here yesterday and will begin discussing the affairs of concluding a mutual assistance treaty with Britain. It is believed that the British-Turkish mutual assistance treaty will be signed in Ankara within a few days. (Associated Press, 4th)

Although the negotiations between the three countries are progressing smoothly, the mutual assistance agreement cannot be initialed until Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu returns from Moscow. (Havas, 4th)

Berlin: The Frankfurter Zeitung recently published an article commenting on the situation in the Balkan Peninsula, stating, "The Soviet Union and Bulgaria are currently negotiating a broad commercial treaty. The friendly relations between the two sides can be seen from this. In Yugoslavia, diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union will be established within a short period of time (note: Yugoslavia has not recognized the Soviet Union since the Russian Revolution). All of this is a good omen, but how to deal with the large number of White Russians residing in the Yugoslav capital may cause some difficulties in the negotiations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union." (Havas, 3rd)

Moscow: Colonel Baitev of Bulgaria, who is responsible for concluding the Soviet-Bulgarian aviation treaty and opening an air route between Moscow and the Bulgarian capital, has been in Moscow for many days.

Paris: The General Headquarters recently issued War Bulletin No. 59, stating, "The enemy repeatedly attacked our side east of the Moselle River and the Saar River today, but were all repelled. The artillery teams of both sides also bombarded each other in that area." (Havas, 3rd)

Paris: A French military expert summarized the strategic importance of the areas gained by the French army on the western front in the Petit Parisien, saying that the French army has occupied 100,000 acres of German territory, and a part of the outposts outside the Siegfried Line are now also owned by the French army. There is a narrow strip of land several kilometers wide between the current battlefield and the Maginot Line, which serves as a barrier to the Maginot Line to prevent long-range German artillery fire. Therefore, German artillery does not damage the Maginot Line. If the German army wants to launch a large-scale offensive, it must first attack its lost land. Even if the French army retreats, the German army must still conquer the defenses recently built by the French army and suffer the fierce fire of French machine guns. The German army will see the Battle of Verdun again. A war bulletin from the French Command Headquarters recently stated that the enemy's strong attack east of the Moselle River and the Saar River has been repelled. Artillery teams of both sides are active in the area. (Reuters, 4th)

Zurich: After the government received news yesterday that German troops were concentrating on the Swiss border, it ordered the recall of all army personnel on leave and reinforced the border. The Swiss government fears that after the Anglo-French rejection of the Soviet-German peace proposals, German troops will attack France via Switzerland. (Associated Press, 4th)

### German Midget Submarine Appears: South American Waters, British Ship "Clement" Confirmed Sunk by German Submarine

Bahia. It is now definitely confirmed that the British ship "Clement," which was sunk in South American waters a few days ago, was indeed sunk by a German warship.

(Reuters, 3rd)

### US Naval Training Fleet, Blocking Japan if Necessary, Hawaii-Based Fleet Strong, Commanded Personally by Rear Admiral Andrews

Washington. The United States' attitude towards Japan is becoming increasingly tough. Naval officials are ignoring Japanese newspaper reports that the US action is an "armed demonstration against Japan" and are vigorously defending the US government's right to send a fleet to Hawaii without prior consultation with Tokyo. The Navy Department claims that the purpose of establishing a security patrol fleet is for training, but Washington officials point out that the naval action may cause diplomatic disputes. The Navy Department confirmed that the 45 warships sent to Hawaii last night are under the personal command of Rear Admiral Andrews, a strategic expert. The fleet will be stationed in the central Pacific on an indefinite basis. Naval circles announced that Rear Admiral Andrews has broad authority and may increase the fleet's strength at will if he feels it is necessary. If the naval bases of San Diego and San Pedro are "too crowded," the Navy Department plans to continue sending other fleets to Hawaii to participate in the security patrol fleet. The fleet consists of a total of 45 warships, including 8 cruisers, and the aircraft carrier "Enterprise" carrying 80 aircraft. In addition, there are 34 destroyers and 2 destroyer tenders. Naval officials in San Pedro stated yesterday that the establishment of the security patrol fleet is to protect the west coast of the United States, from Alaska to the equator. Unofficial sources here indicated that the fleet sent to Hawaii, if supplemented with submarines and aircraft currently stationed in Hawaii, would become an ideal "blockade" fleet. This fact can be seen as highly significant, as rumors here suggest that the government plans to impose an embargo on arms and raw materials to Japan after the expiration of the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty, which will be abolished next January. The security patrol fleet may be training along these lines to be able to implement a blockade at that time. This view is widely considered possible, as naval authorities have announced that Rear Admiral Andrews has the authority to continue to deploy fleets to Hawaii if he feels it is "necessary." If the current fleet is only for routine training, the original fleet would be sufficient for the exercises, and there would be no need to add other warships. (Associated Press, 4th)

Hong Kong. It has been learned here that after 15 US heavy bombers flew to the Philippines last week, the strength of the US Asiatic Fleet will soon be increased by at least six submarines and one supply ship. However, some quarters here say that these submarines are only replacing the original ones. It is expected that three submarines will arrive in the Philippines from Hawaii on the 15th of this month, and the other three will depart from the west coast of the United States on the 15th of November. (Reuters, 4th)

Tokyo. The "Kokumin Shimbun" today published a commentary on US Secretary of State Hull's recent statement refusing to recognize the Soviet occupation of Polish territory, condemning the United States for hypocrisy and irresponsibility, and stating that President Roosevelt should bear some of the responsibility for the European war, because he once declared that the border of the United States was on the Rhine, which in fact implied aid to Britain and France. If the Rhine was indeed the border of the United States, as Roosevelt declared, then the United States should have joined the war, but the United States declared its neutrality and remained aloof. The newspaper also said that the United States is strengthening its fleet in Hawaii and Manila at a time when Chiang Kai-shek's policy is about to collapse, which is tantamount to diverting Japan's attention and providing spiritual assistance. The "Asahi Shimbun" also criticized the matter, saying that it is noteworthy that the United States and the Soviet Union, who often united in the peace front, have now suddenly become estranged. The newspaper also mentioned President Roosevelt's congratulatory telegram to Stalin, saying that the US President's shock at the Soviet occupation of Poland is only natural. The newspaper concluded by saying that according to Moscow news, the United States wants Japan to go to war with the Soviet Union, which is similar to the attempts of Britain and France to conspire to promote a war between Germany and the Soviet Union. This shows that the United States' indifference to the Soviet-Japanese armistice agreement is not without reason. According to the "Mainichi Shimbun," it is natural for Britain and France to refuse to recognize the German and Soviet occupation of Polish territory, but Hull's statement has indeed given the final blow to all peace movements in Europe. The US government determined its attitude towards Poland after consulting with Britain and France, but the result is only to prolong the European war. In short, Hull's statement is a further indication of the United States' intention to participate in the European war. (Reuters, 4th)

Honolulu. In addition to sending 49 naval vessels to the Hawaiian Islands, the United States is now also planning to strengthen Hawaii's air defense equipment. A large number of aircraft are expected to arrive in Hawaii this month. The fighter planes will be capable of flying 300 miles per hour, and the bombers will be comparable to those currently used in Hawaii. In addition, the aircraft carrier "Enterprise," carrying 80 aircraft, will arrive first among the 45 warships. (Associated Press, 4th)

Washington. Congress is very satisfied with the government's dispatch of 45 warships to Hawaii to establish a "security patrol zone." According to diplomatic circles, the United States' dispatch of a part of the Navy to Hawaii is a clear attempt to enhance the United States' position in the Pacific, and at the same time to express the United States' attitude that, although neutral, the United States is also a world power, and if its legitimate rights and interests are violated, the United States certainly has the right to take military and diplomatic action. Democratic Senator Gerald Nye, a member of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, stated, "The sailing of our warships to Hawaii is purely a domestic matter and has nothing to do with international affairs." Moreover, our sea defense is based on the Aleutian Islands, Hawaii, and Panama as lines of defense. The movement of ships in this area is purely our domestic affair and need not alarm others. The opinions of others, such as Ellen T. and Bapuo, are also the same as Bora's. (Associated Press, 4th)

Washington.

### Pan-American Conference Concludes, Three Declarations Adopted

Panama City, Panama. At a plenary public meeting held last night, the Pan-American Conference voted to adopt the declarations drafted at several secret meetings, namely the Declaration of Economic Cooperation, the Declaration of Neutrality, and the Panama Declaration (on the establishment of a continental sea around the Americas as a safety zone). The work of the conference was then concluded. (Havas, 4th)

Panama City, Panama. The "Panama Declaration" adopted by the Pan-American Conference, namely the declaration on the establishment of a "continental sea" around the Americas as a safety zone, is about to be published. Observers from various neutral countries here stated that this declaration should include various provisions against submarines. In other words, American countries will henceforth prohibit warships, submarines, and even armed merchant ships of belligerent countries from entering the "continental sea" in order to ensure navigational safety. In addition, the declaration should also prohibit cargo ships from sending radio messages from American ports in order to avoid violating neutrality. (Havas, 3rd)

### Britain and Japan to Reopen Negotiations on Tianjin Issue

London. Regarding the issue of the British concession in Tianjin, China, well-informed sources here have announced that Britain and Japan may reopen talks in the near future to discuss solutions to local incidents. In other words, only the issues of concession administration and police affairs will be discussed. As for the financial policies that various countries are pursuing towards China, Japan will not put pressure on Britain. The British government will soon instruct its ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, to reopen negotiations with the Japanese authorities. According to Japanese sources, the country's attitude towards all four countries is completely in line with the neutral policy recently announced by its government. Regarding this matter, certain observers believe that if Japan were to change its attitude, the United States would exert pressure on the country, which has already had a considerable impact. (Havas, 4th)

### Ambassador Guo Refutes Japanese Rumors

London. Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi, when interviewed by Reuters today, strongly denied the Japanese claim that China is in danger of being controlled by the Communists. He stated that this rumor is nothing more than propaganda aimed at confusing world public opinion about the true dispute between China and Japan and to give importance to the puppet regimes they intend to establish. The fundamental fact is that China has clearly been fighting for the survival of justice and freedom in the past two years, which is also what Britain and France are fighting for today.

### Japanese Government Passes Establishment of Ministry of Trade

Tokyo. Yesterday afternoon, the Cabinet met and approved the organization of the Ministry of Trade. Today, Prime Minister Abe entered the palace to report this matter to the Japanese Emperor. The new Ministry of Trade will begin operations at the beginning of next year, and all preparations will be made this year. The new ministry will unify commercial administration and promote foreign trade. The affairs handled by the Commercial Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Foreign Exchange Bureau and the Maritime Affairs Section of the Ministry of Finance, the Silk Export Department and the Dairy Products Export Department of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Textile Bureau, Trade Bureau, and Chemicals Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the Korean Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs will all be taken over by the new ministry. However, diplomatic negotiations related to commerce will still be handled by the Commercial Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The newspapers here deeply believe that Abe's organization of the Ministry of Trade will be able to achieve success through harmonious compromise among the relevant ministries. (Reuters, 4th)

Tokyo. The Japanese government's plan to establish a new Ministry of Trade was passed by the Cabinet on the 3rd. According to financial circles, since the outbreak of the China Incident, Japan's trade institutions have gradually changed. At a time when the international situation is about to change, it is necessary to have an ideal organization to manage all trade affairs. The Ministry of Trade established this time is the organization to achieve this goal. However, it will take time for this organization to smoothly implement its tasks, so it is worth paying attention to how the authorities will investigate trade administration.

### Difficulties Exporting Manchurian Soybeans

Tokyo. According to Japanese sources in Changchun, exporters are finding it very difficult to transport soybeans by sea to Germany and Italy due to the European war. Therefore, they are currently inquiring with the Soviet government about the possibility of transporting soybeans to the Axis countries via the Siberian Railway. Soybeans are the main product of Manchukuo, and Germany and Italy are the largest buyers. Last year, Manchukuo exporters exported 23.909 million tons of soybeans and soybean cake, and 60,000 tons of soybean cake. This year, soybean exports decreased by 93,000 tons compared to the same period last year, and soybean oil exports decreased by 1,000 tons, but soybean cake exports increased by 226,000 tons.

It is reported that the ship was sailing from Saigon to Mumbai. (Reuters, 4th)

### UK Parliament Discusses the Situation - Lloyd George Makes Remarks - Any Peace Agreement Should Be Considered Carefully - The House Denounces it as a Sign of Surrender

London - After British Prime Minister Chamberlain firmly declared in the House of Commons today that Britain and France would not abandon their determination to wage war, key figures from various parties spoke one after another, largely welcoming this determination, even the opposition. Labour Party leader Attlee stated, "I agree with the Prime Minister that any peace agreement must be carefully studied, but we must face reality. Speaking of peace when there is no peace is of no help. Merely restoring the situation to what it was a year or two ago will not bring peace to the world. This war has been going on for a long time, not just since the formal declaration of war. What is needed now is action, not empty words, and then there can be peace. The international situation is still chaotic, and it is currently impossible to determine the impact of the German-Soviet agreement." Attlee mentioned reports from the Ministry of Information and broadcasts, saying that the people need more information and that they heard more in Churchill's broadcast speech. Attlee expressed appreciation for the contributions of the people of Newfoundland and Southern Rhodesia to Britain, saying that the astonishing unity of the British Empire is the result of the free association of free people.

Liberal Party leader Sinclair said that while they urgently hope for peace, they are not prepared to sacrifice freedom and the moral values of civilization to purchase this peace, so they must continue to fight until Hitlerism in Germany is broken. Sinclair also reiterated his proposal to hold a non-public parliamentary meeting.

Former Prime Minister Lloyd George then took the floor, advising Parliament not to make hasty judgments, saying that if the entire situation regarding peace depended on Hitler's word, then he feared they would have no other choice but to continue until they had better and more stable guarantees. Judging from news reports and discussions during the Italian government's meeting with Hitler at his invitation, someone will now present detailed conditions to the British government for consideration. Generally speaking, the Italian government has expressed goodwill toward us. He believes that they should not make overly hasty judgments but should give it very careful consideration. This is very important. If they accept the conquest of Poland as a fait accompli and conclude a peace treaty based on this condition, it would be their shame. It is now clear that they will obtain many things far beyond this range, and there are several issues that they should consider, not only the Polish issue but also the Czech issue and the colonial issue. He believes that when the Prime Minister receives a proposal, he should consult with Parliament and hold a non-public meeting to discuss it. The fate of this war does not depend on Britain, France, and Germany, but on the neutral countries. Italy and the Soviet Union should both declare neutrality, and the United States is also a neutral country. Even if they are impartial, they are either our friends or our enemies. The United States, as a neutral country, can help us. They know this, and the United States also knows this. As for Italy and the Soviet Union, within the scope of neutrality, they can change the world between friendly and unfriendly neutral countries.

Prime Minister Chamberlain replied that in the current situation, holding a secret meeting of Parliament does not seem to have any special value. What they have heard so far regarding peace is only a suggestion or an indication that one will be made.

George said that he anticipated this proposal, but it may not come to pass.

Chamberlain said that if any proposal is put forward, the British government does not intend to reply hastily. He sees no reason why Parliament should not have a full opportunity to consider any proposals that may arise in the future and to hear the government's proposed response. He would welcome any proposal that can be genuinely considered to have achieved the war aims of the British government, as he has explained before, more eagerly than anyone else. But at this time, it would be too early to make any hopes for such a proposal to be put forward. Members of the House then discussed the possibility of a peace proposal appearing soon. Former First Lord of the Admiralty Cooper said that Lloyd George's proposal for a secret meeting of Parliament would likely be misunderstood in Europe as a sign of surrender, but Lloyd George certainly did not mean this. He fully supports Chamberlain's statement that "peace cannot be established with the current German government because the current German government will never abide by any peace it signs."

Lloyd George interjected, saying that he would never want to propose surrender. Labour Party member Grenfell and Conservative Party member Croft both spoke after George, criticizing George's inappropriate remarks. Independent Labour Party member Buchanan and Labour Party member Ballach, both known for their anti-war views, then spoke in favor of opening peace talks, saying that the issues currently in dispute are not worth sacrificing the lives of millions of people. Liberal Party member Morris Jones spoke, being very disrespectful of George's words, asking whether George would dare to make these remarks again in his Welsh constituency. Conservative Party member Keyser stood up and said that George's words were misunderstood, and even at this time, Prime Minister Chamberlain was still striving to seek a peace for Europe that could preserve civilization. Several Labour Party members then stood up to speak. Tinker advocated that the British government continue to fight until it obtains better conditions than are currently available, and Labour Party members Silverman and Cohen both advocated that Britain should state the conditions under which it could negotiate peace and make them public, and not give others the initiative.

In his speech, Prime Minister Chamberlain (referring to the Ministry of Information, said that as a result of reviewing the methods of disseminating news, it has now been decided to restore all the pre-war habits, with newspaper reporters directly contacting various government departments, each department having its own method of issuing news to journalists. As for the mechanical facilities in the Ministry of Information building for receiving and sending government news, there is no intention to abolish them. The new method will be implemented from Monday of next week. The inspection of materials submitted to newspapers will continue to be carried out by inspectors as usual. The government has now appointed Sir Monckton as the Chief Censor and will monitor the method of supplying news to newspapers. It is reported that Monckton is 48 years old and is a well-known figure in the legal profession. (Reuters, 3rd)

The "New York Times" reported that the intense emotion caused by Lloyd George's remarks in the British House of Commons yesterday, suggesting that German peace terms should be carefully considered, is further evidence that democracy is still working in Britain. Important events concerning Britain's war aims can still be questioned and answered as usual. It is not difficult to imagine what would happen if such events occurred in the German Reichstag or the Supreme Soviet. (Reuters, 4th)

### British Intelligence Department Activities in Japan

### Poland Was Fooled by Britain and France - Berlin Claims to Have Evidence to Support This

Berlin - The Polish ambassador to France denied that former Polish President Mościcki and General Śmigły-Rydz had several conversations with a prominent figure in a church in Romania. Authoritative sources here today revealed details of these conversations. Śmigły-Rydz said that he had decided to negotiate peace the day after the start of the war. The British told him that under no circumstances should he negotiate peace and promised to use the full strength of the British army, navy, and air force to assist Poland. It was also said that the British government had officially informed the Polish government that 1,500 British aircraft had departed for Poland, but Poland never saw the British aircraft arrive. British officials also assured the Polish government that two points of the German Siegfried Line had been breached and that French troops had penetrated deep into German territory. President Mościcki said that the German army did not use poison gas or drop poison gas bombs during this operation. People in Berlin stated that the prominent figure in the church who had spoken with Mościcki and Śmigły-Rydz belonged to the Greek Orthodox Church. It can be seen that although the Vatican's claim that no prominent figures in the Catholic Church had spoken with Mościcki and Śmigły-Rydz is true, it still cannot disprove the existence of this conversation.

Another report said that authoritative sources here also presented equally important news of a similar nature that a certain Polish diplomat had also revealed. This news, reported by Italian newspapers, was a report from Beijing. According to the report, Colonel Beck, a former Polish official, was also willing to consider Germany's proposal at the end of August, but because Colonel Śmigły-Rydz informed him that Britain had firmly assured Poland that the British Air Force would provide assistance to Poland, Beck did not say much. Later, Beck again asked Chamberlain to confirm this guarantee. Chamberlain still confirmed it, saying that the French Air Force would also be dispatched and would cooperate with the British Air Force to assist Poland. After the outbreak of hostilities, Chamberlain refused to send the air force to Poland. The facts are all there, and there is no need to say more. German authoritative sources solemnly declared that if anyone doubts our words, we can prove them in an appropriate way. All the data or arguments regarding the above-mentioned conversations are indeed in German hands. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

### New York Exchange Market Situation - Pound Sterling and French Franc Firm

New York - In today's New York foreign exchange market, the prices of neutral countries' currencies plummeted. Foreign exchange market participants are studying the remarks made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons. Trading is still very light, but the British pound and the French franc are still firm. The British pound opened today at $4.0175 and closed at $4.03125. The French franc opened at 2.28 and closed at 2.2875. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Chinese Troops Repeatedly Attack Guangzhou - Plainclothes Units Annihilate Thirty to Forty Japanese Soldiers - Japanese Fuel for Baiyun Airport Set Ablaze - Japanese Ammunition and Supplies at Shiwuitang Burned

(Hong Kong Correspondence) - The situation in Guangzhou is becoming increasingly chaotic. Chinese guerrilla forces are rising up and active, and they have already achieved significant results. The Japanese army is finding it extremely difficult to cope. The situation is recorded as follows:

In the past half month, the Japanese army in Guangdong has been actively strengthening its inner line of defense in Guangzhou because it has been suffering repeated defeats in the Northeast. In the past ten days, it has forcibly captured more than 2,000 strong young men in the city and driven them to the Guangzhou-Huaxian and Guangzhou-Conghua lines to build fortifications for them or forced them to serve as cannon fodder. Chinese guerrilla forces have also taken the opportunity to mix into the conscripted people and become active. On the morning of September 16, several dozen plainclothes members of a certain unit, disguised as civilians, were captured by the Japanese army in Xiguan and sent to Xicun to serve as coolies. That night, at 12 o'clock, taking advantage of the Japanese soldiers' sound sleep, they responded from within and without, and surrounded and annihilated more than 100 members of the Japanese Ando unit. The Japanese soldiers resisted desperately in a panic. After a fierce battle lasting more than an hour, thirty to forty Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and two Japanese barracks were burned down. The Chinese army seized more than ten rifles. The Chinese air force Shenying team has repeatedly conducted reconnaissance raids on the Japanese positions in Guangzhou recently. On the 18th, Chinese planes entered the city twice for reconnaissance. The first time was at around 11 a.m., with a total of eight aircraft, arranged in formation, entering the city from the Huangsha Railway Station. They dropped a large number of leaflets and slogans in the city center and the Henan area, and conducted reconnaissance over the Baiyun and Tianhe Japanese airfields in the northeastern suburbs of the city before leaving the city at 12 o'clock. The second time was at 2 p.m., with a total of three aircraft flying along the Guangzhou-Huaxian highway and circling over the city before retreating at 2:30 p.m. No bombs were dropped. The propaganda materials dropped by the Chinese planes that day were about the significance of the "September 18" anniversary and explained the National Government's determination to persist in the war of resistance, and stated that the Chinese army would soon launch a major counteroffensive. The people in the city were very excited to see this.

At around 11 p.m. on the night of the 19th, dense gunfire was suddenly heard in the northern suburbs, like a string of firecrackers. Local residents were alarmed when they heard the news and panicked. Near Niulangang, the sound of fire and explosions was heard one after another. The sounds stopped at around 3 a.m. After investigation, it was learned that Chinese guerrilla forces had attacked Baiyun Airport and burned the Japanese army's fuel depot, causing a major fire. It was found that the Japanese army had transported hundreds of cans of fuel oil on the 18th, which were all burned to ashes that night, resulting in a great loss. The Japanese army panicked as a result of this battle. On the 20th, it ordered martial law, and all traffic in the northeastern suburbs was cut off. That night, plainclothes members of a certain Chinese army unit suddenly appeared again near the Shuangshan Temple when the Japanese army's guard was relaxed. They rushed straight to the Guangzhou-Huaxian highway station at the foot of Guanyin Mountain. The Japanese army was caught by surprise and became even more panicked. Chinese guerrilla forces beheaded fifteen Japanese sentries along the way. Seeing more than a dozen transport vehicles parked at the station, they destroyed three of them, killing or wounding several Japanese drivers.

At around 4 a.m. on the 21st, the dare-to-die team of the Chinese army's Liang unit gathered to attack the Shiwuitang Railway Station on the Guangzhou-Sanshui Railway. Since the Japanese army in Guangzhou has been replenishing ammunition and supplies to the Sanshui area recently, a large number of military supplies were stored at the station. The Chinese army mixed into the platform through clever action. First, they killed four railway policemen with broadswords, and then set fire to two train cars full of military supplies. The flames blazed for a while. The Japanese army rushed out in a panic, but the Chinese army had already retreated towards Huadi. The Japanese army disturbed the area until dawn before regretfully returning to the team.

### Japanese Troops in Chao-Shan Lose Contact - Japanese Troops in Chao-an Repeatedly Try to Break Through Without Success - The Middle Section of the Fuyang Railway Has Been Cut Off

Shantou Correspondence - The Chinese army's Wu Qizhi unit recently advanced eastward from Jieyang Fengshun and recovered Fe'e Ridge and Zhugao Mountain, the northern suburbs of Chao'an City. Han Mountain Dongjin, across the river, was also recovered on September 19. As the troops advanced east along the dike, the vanguard of a certain brigade passed Raoping Longdu and bypassed the Jishuitou Pagoda. The local militias of Chao-Shan-Rao responded when they heard the news. On the 22nd, the Chenghai Zhanglin team recovered Chenghai City. The Chinese army on the front of the An-Jie Road captured Fuyang Station on the Chao-Shan Railway on the 23rd and then attacked the southern suburbs of Chao'an from Fengxi. The Chinese army in Longdu also crossed the river by bamboo raft and regained the Yunbu, Yinhu, and Han River tributary traffic on the levee highway, which was also cut off. On the 22nd, another 2,000 puppet troops from Shantou arrived, mostly from Wuxi and Yixing in Jiangsu, along with more than 2,000 Taiwanese troops, who were divided into more than 20 speedboats. One part went to Chao'an City to reinforce, and the other part went to Anbu to reinforce, carrying a large amount of ammunition and grain. That morning, the artillery battle outside the northwest gate of Chao City was very fierce. The Japanese army's position on Hulu Mountain was fought over with bayonets by both sides, with gains and losses decided several times. More than 300 Japanese recruits and five tanks rushed out of the west gate and headed straight for Fengxi on the An-Jie highway, hoping to relieve the siege of the northeast gate. Seeing that the Japanese army was coming too fiercely, the Chinese army retreated to the northwest mountainous area of Yunbu Terrace and fought fiercely with the Japanese army all day long. On the 23rd, the Chinese army on Zhugao Mountain and Bijia Mountain held their positions and did not retreat. The battle moved to the outskirts of Chao'an again. Fuyang was reoccupied by the Japanese army. At 2 a.m. on the 24th, taking advantage of the Japanese army's unsteady footing, the Chinese army attacked Yangyang from the side of Wuyang and recaptured Fuyang, Gezhou, and Yunbu, killing more than 50 Japanese soldiers. That afternoon, the artillery battle on the Yunbu side was extremely fierce. The Japanese army began to retreat towards Chao City at around 1 p.m. Traffic between Chao and Shan has been cut off to this day. The Japanese army from Shantou to Chao by water now has to move to Chenghai and does not dare to dock above the Xiangzi Bridge. On the 21st, the Chinese army sank seven or eight Japanese speedboats and rubber boats near Yixi. Later, the Japanese speedboats changed their berth near the Banana Garden in the South Gate, using the Anji Saint King Temple and the Chuncheng Building Station, and the Guandi Palace in the South Teaching Ground as military stations. Zhang Weichen's puppet maintenance association has also moved out of the city. On the 25th, the sound of artillery in Chao City moved to the southwest wilderness. The Chinese army team in Chenghai City automatically retreated to the Fengshan Henglong River surface to intercept the Japanese speedboats coming and going on the river. After the Japanese army in Anbu City was attacked by the Chinese army's Wu Shaowu team on the evening of the 20th (the Japanese army camp in a certain shrine in Dahebu was burned, and more than 110 Japanese soldiers died), they changed their encampment to the high ground outside the railway line, preferring to sleep in the open rather than occupy civilian houses. Above Anbu, such as Huamei, Caitang, Hechao Wuyang, Fuyang, and Fengxi, have all been recovered by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in Chao'an is trapped in the city, and water and land traffic have been cut off. There is no way to break through. The Chinese army is conducting operations to annihilate them.

### Japanese Army in Xiamen Attempts to Issue Counterfeit Currency in Xiamen - The People Resolutely Refuse to Use It

Xiamen Correspondence - The Japanese army in Xiamen is actively planning to establish a Xiamen branch of the puppet Huaxing Bank and issue counterfeit currency in order to disrupt the finances of South China. For the past month, the Liaison Department of the Japanese Army's Asia Development Board in Xiamen has repeatedly summoned the section chiefs of the puppet municipal government, the committee members of the puppet municipal chamber of commerce, and various traitors in the city to discuss the establishment of a Xiamen branch of the Huaxing Bank. There was a lot of discussion at the first meeting, and no consensus could be reached. The economic minister of the liaison department, ××××, who attended the meeting, saw that the puppet mayor, Li Sixian, was hesitant and asked him about it. Li immediately expressed his opinion, saying that Xiamen is a small island, Gulangyu is dominated by foreign powers, and the mainland regime still belongs to the Kuomintang government. Even if we issue banknotes, they will only circulate on one island. Not only will we not make a profit, but we will also lose money. The minister then announced the adjournment of the meeting. Three or four days later, five-colored small slogans and announcements suddenly appeared successively in the streets and alleys of the city and in the villages and towns of Heshan, detailing the Japanese conspiracy to deceive and exchange legal tender and the worthlessness of counterfeit currency, and asking the people of Xiamen to refuse to use counterfeit banknotes. Four or five days later, slogans and leaflets of the Xiamen-He All Circles Refuse to Use Counterfeit Currency Grand Alliance flew all over the city. However, on August 18, the minister still did not give up and summoned the committee members of the puppet municipal chamber of commerce and traitors to a meeting to detail the situation of raising operating expenses, setting the amount at 170,000 yuan, which would be apportioned among the merchants. The traitors were shocked and jointly proposed to use the public property of the Tongshan Hall and the unreturned real estate as a discount. The minister was furious and rebuked them, and they dispersed in disappointment. That night, the Refuse to Use Counterfeit Currency Grand Alliance intensified its activities, and there were more slogans on the streets. However, the next day, ××××, the head of the Xiamen Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, issued a statement, saying that no matter how bad the environment, the "Huaxing" branch must be established, but the people's refusal to use counterfeit currency is very firm.

### Education News - Able-bodied Young Men Studying in Primary and Secondary Schools Will Not Be Granted Deferment - Various Wartime Training Classes in Various Provinces Should Be Submitted to the Ministry for Approval Based on Their Nature and Needs

(Fangyan News) - The Military Control Zone Command recently interpreted five items of the revised Provisional Regulations for the Implementation of Military Service, which are very important to the future of military administration. The details are as follows: (1) Article 29 of the Revised Provisional Regulations for the Implementation of Military Service states that those who are still subject to mobilization and conscription into the camp for military service during wartime refer to the conscription specified in the Provisional Rules for Army Conscription. The meaning of the original text is very clear. The implementation of this conscription should still be carried out in accordance with the implementation of the national conscription and lottery in times of emergency. As for how to conscript and enlist those whose physical condition is not suitable for active service, it should be handled in accordance with the regulations at the time of implementation of the conscription. (2) What is the definition of the two words "director" in the phrase "director of official affairs"? The government has already sent a telegram to the Ministry of Military Affairs to explain it and ordered compliance. (3) Able-bodied young men studying in senior high schools, junior high schools, and primary schools will not be granted deferment in the future. As for the students receiving training in various wartime training classes in various provinces, they should be submitted to the ministry for approval based on their nature and needs. (4) Although the word "old age" is not noted by age in the revised regulations, judging from the general point of view and the principles of legislation, it should be determined by the fact that old age requires the maintenance of their children, and it can be handled according to the actual situation. (5) The revised parts of the Revised Provisional Regulations for the Implementation of Military Service should be implemented from the date of the order.

### Trends in Teacher Education in Various Countries (6) – Instrumentalist Approaches in Japan and Russia

Some people compare Guizot of France with Mori Arinori of Japan because they both laid the foundation for national education in their respective countries. That is, they created a rigorous, complete, and compulsory teacher education system. Since the Meiji Restoration, Japan's education system has been modeled after France. To this day, with the exception of the university district system, which was abolished early on, other aspects such as the teacher education districts and elementary education districts remain the same. Even the two national higher normal schools for men and women stand in distant, echoing opposition to each other. Therefore, Japanese teacher education is similar to that of France in form, but each has its own focus in spirit. The emperor-centric ideology in Japan was originally a call to overthrow the feudal clans, but it was able to establish its foundation and deeply penetrate the hearts of the people. Discerning individuals should recognize that the credit for this should be given to the elementary and secondary school teachers. Because they possess the spirit of missionaries, they are able to concentrate the people's centripetal force towards the emperor and link the emperor's connection to the people. They have already become political propagandists or active cells. In other words, they have transformed into tools of the state. As for the effects of teacher education in Soviet Russia, they have not yet been fully revealed, but it is precisely using role models of advanced workers of the branch labor movement and believers and practitioners of communism to mold its elementary and secondary school teachers. From the understanding and application of teacher education in Japan and Russia, they share similar views, which is to regard teacher education as a political tool.

(1) Japan: In 1886, Japan promulgated the Teacher Education Ordinance, dividing normal schools into ordinary and higher levels. It also mandated that each prefecture establish one school and declared the training objectives to be the three virtues of obedience, trust and love, and dignity and respect. Military training and management were used as means to achieve these goals. In 1887, the Teacher Education Ordinance was revised, removing the word "ordinary" from ordinary normal schools and allowing each prefecture to establish multiple schools. In 1907, the Regulations for Normal Schools were promulgated, with subsequent partial revisions. The current normal schools are divided into regular courses and specialized courses. The regular courses are further divided into Part 1 and Part 2. The admission qualification for Part 1 is the completion of the second year of higher elementary school, with an age of 14 or above, and the duration of study is five years. Part 2 requires a secondary school qualification, with graduates of secondary schools or those with equivalent academic qualifications studying for one year. However, women entering Part 2 study for one or two years. The specialized courses are for graduates of the regular courses of both Part 1 and Part 2, or those with equivalent academic qualifications, and the duration of study is also one year. The current system allows for the non-establishment of Part 2. In fact, Part 1 is the main body of the normal schools, so reformers debate whether Part 1 or Part 2 should be the main focus. The enrollment quota is based on the number of school-age children in the prefecture, as determined by the local governor. The graduates are granted elementary school teacher licenses by the local governor upon application by the school principal. The main points of their education are to make loyalty to the emperor and patriotism a necessary condition for teachers. Therefore, their daily life should clarify the great righteousness of loyalty and filial piety, and invigorate their ambition and integrity as citizens. Furthermore, cultivating the spirit, encouraging moral character, obeying rules, maintaining order, and developing habits of self-study are considered necessary qualities for teachers. Therefore, in the curriculum arrangement, the subject of moral cultivation is included every academic year, with an average of two hours of lectures per week. The subject of civics is only included in the fourth and fifth academic years.

The teachers of secondary education in Japan are in fact divided into what is known as the Meikei system and the Akamon system. Generally, the Meikei system is dominant in normal schools and higher elementary schools, while the Akamon system is dominant in general middle schools and high schools. The Meikei system refers to the Tokyo Higher Normal School, while the Akamon system refers to the Tokyo Imperial University. Because Japan established two higher normal schools for men and women to cultivate teachers for secondary schools, there is one higher normal school for men and one for women in Tokyo, and others are located in Hiroshima for men and Nara for women. Initially, in 1894, the Regulations for Higher Normal Schools were revised, dividing the schools into departments of literature and science, placing the natural history department in the science department, and setting the duration of study at four years. Although there have been changes since then, the basic structure remains the same. Currently, the higher normal schools, in addition to the departments of literature and science, also have a physical education department at the Tokyo Higher Normal School and an education department at the Hiroshima Higher Normal School. Furthermore, the Tokyo and Nara Women's Higher Normal Schools have a home economics department. In addition, there are specialized courses and elective courses. To enable graduates of general universities to obtain secondary school teacher qualifications, special research courses have been established. The Tokyo and Hiroshima Higher Normal Schools are further divided into four divisions in the Department of Literature: (1) Moral Education and Civics, (2) Japanese Language and Chinese Literature, (3) English, (4) Geography and History. The Department of Science is divided into three divisions: (1) Mathematics, (2) Physics and Chemistry, (3) Natural History. The Department of Physical Education is divided into Group A, which includes gymnastics and athletics, and Group B, which includes judo and kendo. The Department of Home Economics is also divided into two divisions: (1) Home Economics, (2) Sewing. The undergraduate course lasts four years and admits graduates of normal schools, middle schools, and higher girls' schools. Tuition is not charged, and graduates are obligated to serve for a certain period as designated by the Ministry of Education. In 1933, the Tokyo and Hiroshima Higher Normal Schools were upgraded to Universities of Literature and Science, but they retained their original Higher Normal Schools as affiliated institutions. This paved a new path for high school graduates to advance into the education field, and at the same time, it could expand the influence of the Higher Normal Schools to high schools and specialized schools. Because graduates of the Universities of Literature and Science can obtain not only general secondary school licenses but also high school and specialized school licenses. The entire secondary education system in Japan is almost entirely interconnected. The Higher Normal Schools monopolize the normal schools, and the normal schools monopolize the elementary schools. This kind of mechanism seems to turn elementary and secondary school teachers into grassroots active cells of emperor-centric ideology. Of course, there are also secondary school teachers who come from "certification" or "examination," but in the reality of the education field, they are probably as insignificant as a grain of millet in the vast ocean and do not occupy an important position at all.

### Ministry of Education Establishes Student Guidance Office in Kunming to Guide Students Arriving in Kunming from Various Regions

(Chongqing, 4th) In order to guide students and graduates coming from the occupied areas to Kunming to participate in the unified entrance examination and to further their studies or serve in the rear, the Ministry of Education established the Student Guidance Office in Kunming last month. Cha Liangzhao was appointed as the director, and Wu Chunwu was appointed as the deputy director. The office is responsible for taking care of student accommodation, guiding student life and thought, and assisting students in solving problems related to further studies or transfers. The office's main task recently is to register students who have lost their schooling in the occupied areas and high school graduates who have recently arrived from Peiping, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Nanjing and did not have time to participate in the university entrance examination. The office will send a letter to Southwest University requesting a special examination. It is said that the National Southwest Associated University will hold the examination soon.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Tightens After Initial Easing, US Dollar Reaches 8 Yuan in the Morning, Buying Spree Leads to Sudden Reversal

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the official HSBC exchange rates. The unofficial market for British and American currencies experienced dramatic fluctuations, with frequent ups and downs that were difficult to grasp. The overall situation shifted from weak to strong. Initially, there was selling pressure from Hong Kong and other locations via telegraph, and Western merchants like Sassoon and smaller Chinese and Western speculators also tended to sell. Although HSBC and Wah Hsing took the opportunity to buy, the trend continued to be downward. At one point, the British gold rate eased to 4 shillings and 75 pence, and the US dollar rate strengthened to 8 yuan. The British rate reached its lowest level since July 20th of this year, and the US dollar rate reached its highest level since breaking through the 8 yuan mark on August 5th. Later, rampant and unsubstantiated rumors spread in the market, including reports of improved relations between Britain and Japan and the resignation of a certain minister. In addition, Japanese silk factories had significant cotton settlement needs, and Chinese merchants also urgently shifted their focus to buying. The British bank HSBC also absorbed a large amount, so the situation immediately became tight. The lowest British gold rate was 4 shillings and 40.625 pence, and the US dollar rate was 7 yuan and 40.625 pence. At noon, the buying spree subsided slightly, and the rates returned to normal, closing at 4 shillings and a half and 7 yuan and 52.5 pence. As a result, the British rate was tighter and the US rate was looser than the previous day. The British rate tightened by 1.875 pence, and the US rate loosened by 0.25 pence, due to the increase of 1.375 pence in the exchange rate between the US and British currencies. As for the October futures, the trend was similar to the spot market, and trading was still active in the morning.

In the early morning, large orders from London drove up the short-term rate by 375 pence and the long-term rate by 4375 pence. New York silver prices rose by 25 points, and London gold prices remained unchanged. The exchange rates for British, American, and French currencies remained flat, while the exchange rate against Shanghai rose by 1.5625 pence. The US dollar rate rose by 1.375 pence against the British currency, increased by 10 cents against Shanghai, and rose by 1 cent against the French currency. The central bank's official exchange rates remained the same. In the morning, banks opened with spot selling prices of 4 shillings and 68.75 pence for British gold and 7 yuan and 87.5 pence for the US dollar, which was the same for the British rate and 0.0625 pence higher for the US rate compared to the previous close, due to the increase in the exchange rate. After the opening, a sudden selling order arrived from Hong Kong via telegraph, and Western merchants like Sassoon and smaller Chinese and Western speculators also followed suit, so the situation continued to loosen. It is estimated that foreign telegraphs and Chinese and Western speculators sold to HSBC, Wah Bi, Chase, certain foreign banks, and Chinese banks. The spot British gold rate rose from 4 shillings and 71.875 pence to 75 pence, and the spot US dollar rate strengthened from 7 yuan and 90.625 pence to 8 yuan. The HSBC official exchange rate remained unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced to be 1.5 fen higher. Afterwards, foreign banks became more willing to buy, and the Japanese bank Zhengjin also suddenly became active, so the market immediately softened. It is estimated that the Japanese bank and foreign banks, with the help of Chase, bought spot British gold from Chinese merchants and foreign banks at 4 shillings and 62.5 pence, softening it to 56.25 pence, and the spot US dollar rate loosened from 7 yuan and 87.5 pence to 62.5 pence. Later, selling orders arrived again from overseas via telegraph, and certain banks also expressed a strong intention to sell, so the market situation turned weak again. It is estimated that foreign banks absorbed spot British gold from foreign telegraphs and certain banks at 4 shillings and 62.5 pence and 65.625 pence, and spot US dollars at 7 yuan and 68.75 pence and 78.25 pence. At that time, rumors suddenly spread that a certain minister had resigned. In addition, Japanese silk factories had numerous cotton settlements, and Chinese merchants also urgently followed suit, and it was difficult for banks to sell, so the situation turned tight again. It is estimated that Japanese silk factories and Chinese merchants settled and sold spot British gold to foreign banks at 4 shillings and 56.25 pence, narrowing it to 40.625 pence, and spot US dollars tightened from 7 yuan and 68.75 pence to 40.625 pence. At noon, the situation was slightly calm. Extended to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price was 4 shillings and a half for British gold and 7 yuan and 56.25 pence for the US dollar. The British gold rate for the current month was 4 shillings and 43.75 pence, and the US dollar rate was 7 yuan and 43.75 pence. As a result, compared to the previous day's spot price, the British rate returned to a tight level by 1.875 pence, and the US rate loosened by 0.25 pence. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday. The situation was slightly calmer, but the trend was still strong. The securities firms and certain money exchange firms resumed raising the price, opening at 4,045 yuan and raising it to 4,060 yuan. As a result, it closed at 4,058 yuan, an increase of 43 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was still active in the morning, but turned light in the afternoon, with a total of about 1,200 taels. Gold jewelry stores raised their prices by 5 yuan accordingly. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.

### More Foreign Currencies Rise Than Fall

Yesterday's foreign currency market saw most currencies rise except for the Hong Kong dollar, which continued to fall by 5 cents, and the Singapore dollar, which fell by 20 cents. British gold certificates rose by 80 cents following the exchange market. US dollar certificates once reached 13 yuan and 75 cents, but ended at 13 yuan and 65 cents, resulting in an increase of 35 cents. The British pound rose by 2 yuan and 50 cents, the US dollar pound rose by 1 yuan, the French franc certificate rose by 1 cent, and the Annam dollar and Philippine dollar certificates both rose by 10 cents. The Canadian dollar certificate rose by 30 cents, the Japanese yen certificate rose by 1 cent, and the Korean won certificate rose by 8 li. All other currencies remained unchanged.

### Both British and American Silver Prices Rise, Indian Silver Falls Sharply

(3rd, London) According to a telegram from London, the silver market was firm due to Indian purchases and speculator selling. After closing, it turned flat. Buyers were satisfied. Large silver bars, near term, rose by 375 points, and long term, rose by 4375 points. According to a New York silver telegram, US spot prices rose by 25 points. Also, according to a Bombay silver telegram, the Indian silver market was inclined to be weak. Both spot and futures prices fell sharply by 1 rupee and 8 annas.

### Discount Rate Remains Steady, Call Loan Rate Marked Down by 0.02

Yesterday's bill discount rate for exchange drafts was initially around 70 yuan per thousand, but it was unsustainable and fell to 67.5 yuan. It only rebounded in the afternoon, ending at 70 yuan, which was the same as the previous day's price. The call loan rate of the Money Dealers' Association was suddenly marked down by 0.02 to 0.18 yuan.

### Cash Rebounds After Attempted Decline

Yesterday's spot market for cash ingots fluctuated rapidly, rising and falling sharply. The market opened weak in the morning and then strengthened, entirely depending on the tightness or looseness of foreign exchange. Initially, the market was quite loose, and sentiment was weak. Certain money exchange firms aggressively sought to sell, and demand from guest merchants was sluggish, causing the market to open sharply lower at 3,970 yuan and then fall further to a low of 3,950 yuan. Then, sudden rumors spread in the market, including baseless reports of improved relations between Britain and Japan and the resignation of a certain minister. At the same time, foreign exchange also tightened sharply, causing sentiment to turn around. Securities firms and certain money exchange firms aggressively bought at the low, and certain gold firms also followed suit initially, but then exited to take profits. However, the market price once rose to a peak of 4,085 yuan. At noon, foreign exchange returned to a slightly flat level, so the price fell to 4,047 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market was closed, and the situation became slightly calmer, but the trend remained strong. Securities firms and certain money exchange firms resumed pushing up the price, opening at 4,045 yuan and raising it to 4,060 yuan. As a result, it closed at 4,058 yuan, an increase of 43 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was still active in the morning, but turned slow in the afternoon, with a total of about 1,200 taels. Gold jewelry stores raised their prices by 5 yuan accordingly. Customs gold and other items remained unchanged.

Ingots Rebound by 43 Yuan

From the beginning of the morning, the situation was quite weak. The exchange rate was loose and strong, and the buyers were waiting and hesitating. The price immediately dropped by 45 yuan, a certain money dealer sold 30 taels to the securities firm for 3,970 yuan. After opening, a certain money dealer still had a strong intention to sell. It was reduced by 20 yuan to sell to the same industry for 10 taels and the cash store sold 20 taels to the money dealer for 3,950 yuan. At that time, it was heard that the exchange rate had softened. A certain money exchange firm bought it hard on behalf of the customer, although the silver building gang came to sell, the position still felt insufficient for distribution, so the trend suddenly became firm and immediately returned to 80 yuan. The gold store bought 20 taels from the silver building gang, which became 4,030 yuan. Later, due to the sale of cash shops, the price was reduced to 4,015 yuan. The speculators suddenly came to absorb and raised it by 20 yuan, and the money exchange industry traded 30 taels, which was 4,035 yuan. Later, the exchange rate became weaker, and a certain gold store suddenly made a profit and exited, so it fell again, and the gold store traded 10 taels to each other for 4,000 yuan. Afterwards, there were rumors of a minister's resignation, and the exchange rate tightened sharply, and people's hearts rose. The securities gang and a certain money dealer rushed to make progress on behalf of their customers. For a while, sellers were quite scarce, and the price soared by 85 yuan. The gold store mutually traded 20 taels for 4,085 yuan. At noon, because the exchange rate was slightly firm, the price rose sharply by 38 yuan. The securities gang sold 30 taels to the money dealer, which was 4,047 yuan, as the midday market. In the afternoon, the situation was quite flat. The opening price was reduced by 20 yuan, and the gold store sold 10 taels to the money dealer, which was 4,045 yuan. Later, the securities gang and a certain money dealer successively absorbed more than 100 taels, raising it by 15 yuan. The money dealer made 10 taels to the gold store for 4,060 yuan. Then the money exchange industry mutually traded 10 taels for 4,058 yuan for the evening closing price. As a result, it rose 43 yuan compared to the previous day. The whole day rose and fell by 135 yuan. The selling price of the current gold brand of the cash store was 10 yuan higher than the current price, and the purchase was reduced by about 30 yuan. The current gold price is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there are few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Was Listed 5 Yuan Higher Yesterday

At the beginning, Datong Hang still suspended 405 yuan for each tael of jewelry gold, but at 11:08, it was listed 5 yuan higher. After that, there was no change. As a result, Datong Hang changed to suspend 410 yuan. The new industry is the same as the previous price, and the purchase must be reduced by about 20 yuan.

### Securities: Government Bonds See Active Buying in the Morning, but are Thwarted by Rumors in the Afternoon

The securities spot market was in a hovering state yesterday. However, many in the market were optimistic, so the market price was easy to rise but difficult to fall. In the morning, continuing the previous day's rising momentum, it continued to rise. Grade C once rose to 46 yuan and 80 cents, and Grade A broke through the 54 yuan mark. The situation was excellent for a time, and buyers were quite active. There were many buying interests from the 20th issue. Yongkangtai, Yuanyuan, and other firms had considerable volume. Later, Runheng suddenly sold a large batch, about 300,000 or so, and the rising momentum was frustrated. However, the noon closing was still about half a yuan higher. In the afternoon, there were sudden rumors of the resignation of a certain minister, and the selling sentiment in the market turned strong, and the market price fell by about half a yuan. Later, the 20th and 38th issues still had buying interest, so they were able to rebound slightly. As a result, they fell by a slight 5 cents to 20 cents. Only Grade E was good for 10 cents, and 96 was also good for 15 cents. The total turnover was about 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock trading: 150 shares of China Merchants Electric Power were traded at a price of 5 yuan and 31 cents.

Also, the Public Industry Association reported that the only feature of yesterday's stock market was the silent rise of Rui Rong shares and its rare phoenix-like transaction. At the close, buyers were bidding 11 yuan and 50 cents, and sellers were demanding 11 yuan and 70 cents. Yesong United Shipyard shares also soared to 145 yuan and a half. China Reclamation shares were slightly weak. Other stocks saw little change.

### Yarn Flowers: Current Sales Hopeless, Cotton Yarn Once Plunged

The yarn market continued to trend downwards, but most people in the market held an optimistic view, and there were quite a few who were willing to speculate and buy, so the market dynamics were unstable, rising and falling suddenly, which was very inconsistent. The result was still a decline, which was really due to the weakness of current sales. Hong Kong's exchange control was strict, and silver funds could not be remitted at will, which greatly affected procurement in South China. However, operators in this port were very enthusiastic, so the situation presented a hesitant appearance. However, during the period of falling prices, buyer activity was particularly intense, so as soon as good news was encountered, the false momentum disappeared. Currently, from the perspective of its trend, it is feared that it will not be easy to rise sharply for a while.

The opening of current yarn this morning was very discouraging, because current sales were hopeless, and the industry also held a wait-and-see attitude. The opening price fell by eighteen yuan, and the spot price of 20-count "Changing Horse" yarn was 750 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 728 yuan. However, after the decline, it triggered the activity of short covering, and everyone rushed to buy, and the market slightly rebounded. Near the close, buyers suddenly crowded in, and it was rumored that a certain minister had resigned, and a surge suddenly rose, jumping ten yuan. According to statistics, the turnover in half a day was 980 bales. Yesterday, British factories opened 2,650 bales of 20-count "Five Blessings," "Shepherd," "Three Stars," and other yarns. The total turnover for two days was 3,630 bales. The price of 20-count "Double Horse" yarn fell by six yuan, "Heavenly Maiden" did not move, "Double Globe" fell by six yuan. Hong Tong Factory opened 100 bales of 10-count "New Solid Yi," with a price of 612 yuan. An Da Factory opened 600 bales of 10-count "Flying Tiger," with prices ranging from 585 yuan to 590 yuan. Today, there were 2,045 pieces exported to Tianjin, and another 20 pieces exported to Yantai. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:

Mainland: 160, Fellow Traders: 685

Ningbo: 35, Yunnan: 100

Total: 980

Another report: Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions. This morning, due to the long exchange period, the trading intentions among the industry were quite weak, so the market transactions were very quiet. In the afternoon, the exchange rate suddenly tightened again, and transactions were slightly looser. There were also many inquiries from all parties, although there were not many actual transactions. The selling price of West Indian cotton was 180 yuan, "White Lock" was 170 yuan, and "Pingguoer" was 136 yuan, it is said.

Foreign cotton market prices: New York cotton market was weak from the beginning of the morning. News from Liverpool was bad, falling by 35 pound tones. Later, due to the weakness of the stock market and the active selling by Southern merchants, the closing price fell by more than 10 pound tones compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market rose slightly by more than 2 rupees, the Egyptian cotton market fell by 670 pound tones, and Liverpool fell by 8 pence.

### Grain: Arriving in a Rush, Japonica Rice Declines, Wuhu Indica Rice Continues to Be Sold Off by Japanese Merchants, Prices Slightly Lowered Again, Only Lushan Indica Rice is in Short Supply and Rises by Six or Seven Corners

Yesterday, the arrival of national rice in wheelbarrow packages was relatively strong, with four or five thousand packages. People's hearts were more and more uncertain, and there were few visitors from the hometown. Transactions were sluggish, so the opening situation in the early market was weak. Those who had a lot of goods on hand sought to sell them quickly, and everyone lowered prices to attract buyers. The market for all goods was downstream all the way, and there was no big demand even until the livestock market. The downward trend became more and more intense, and each japonica rice fell by about two yuan, and new japonica rice also fell by one yuan to one and a half yuan. "Kejian" rice fell by more than one yuan, while "Yangjian" rice was slightly depreciated by half a yuan because it was easier to sell. "Dulujian" rice was quite popular due to its shortage, rising by six or seven corners each. It is estimated that special regular japonica rice is 42 yuan, medium is 40 yuan, special tin japonica rice is 41 yuan, high is 40 yuan, medium is 39 yuan. Su Tong Kun japonica rice is priced at 10 yuan to 39 yuan, new japonica rice is 37.5 yuan to 38 yuan, Fengjing Baige is 39 yuan, early rice is 36 yuan, Yangjian is 28 yuan, settled at 25 yuan, Lujian is 28.3 yuan, settled at 27.5 yuan, Jiangbei new rice is 22.2 yuan, settled at 21.8 yuan, Wuhu rice is 22.6 yuan, settled at 21.5 yuan, Yu rice is 21 yuan, variable yuan is also small yuan pu, opening at 334 yuan. It is estimated that the total turnover in the city is more than 4,000 packages.

Another report: After the slightly rebounded a few days ago, goods sellers took the opportunity to spit it out again, and the Wuhu indica rice patented by Japanese merchants continued to be sold off in batches. Although indica rice is welcomed by middle and lower-class food households due to its low price, the countryside and villages also exchange indica rice for japonica rice, and sales are particularly strong. The low price of 212 yuan could have been stabilized, but because the inventory is the most abundant and the number of arrivals is high, there are still three or four thousand packages arriving by wheelbarrow yesterday, and there are also warehouse goods in the Hongkou district seeking to be sold off. Therefore, the high and medium grades continued to be lowered by three, five, or seven corners.

### Loss Fee Still Being Sorted Out, Reclaimed Flour's Downward Trend Slightly Abates

Flour: Yesterday's flour market was mediocre and without any special features. The plates of the No. 2 flour mill still stood at the original price of 7 yuan, and the downward trend of the reclaimed goods market also slightly subsided. This is because the sales of the Nanyang gang have been quite active recently, and there have been repeated shipments to Hong Kong, Xiamen, and other places. It is also said that the incident of Fuxin Factory collecting loss fees is being sorted out, so people's hearts are becoming more stable. Yesterday, the retail transactions in the Japanese street were as usual. The Beiyang gang paid attention to the by-product flour, and the sales of No. 2 flour were mediocre. The "Battleship" brand presented a situation of being rejected. The opening price of "Red and Blue Car Cannon" was 6.85 yuan, and the opening price of "Red and Blue Fuxin" was 6.83 yuan. The total number of transactions was estimated to be more than 30,000 packages.

Wheat: Yesterday, the source of wheat arrived but not much, because the production price has not been relaxed and cheapened, and the owners' intention to sell is still firm. However, the sales market is still lacking in development, and the market temporarily has no power to advance. The city only purchased five carts from hoarding households. Fufu and Liang factories purchased 1,600 packages, and the prices were both flat and weak.

### Piece Goods: Flannelette is in Season, Transactions are Booming

National Cloth

Yesterday, affected by the fall in the price of cotton yarn in Dongpi, people's hearts were slightly soft, and new transactions in Guangdong and Hong Kong showed a wait-and-see attitude. Dyeing factories and Sui offices purchased grey cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill, and transactions suddenly became clear. The market was very chaotic, falling by one corner to two and a half corners per piece. However, coarse cloth and flannelette were still firm and expensive because the sales markets in this street and inland gangs were lively. Due to the increased bleaching and dyeing fees, the price of grey cloth that was bleached and dyed slightly fell, but the opening price was still flat. This street and hoarding corpses traded more than 1,000 packages of coarse cloth and coarse twill. The wholesale shops at the storefronts were busy with adding flannelette goods to sell. 7,000 to 8,000 pieces of lining flannelette, twill flannelette, and patterned flannelette were sold. Subei Taizhou and other places purchased 50 packages of fine cloth and coarse cloth, and more than 3,000 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. The Yunnan gang purchased more than 30 boxes of crepe and woolen cloth, and more than 2,000 pieces of colored cloth and printed satin goods. New transactions in Guangdong and Yongbang were slightly clearer, and ordering and shipping were still extremely crowded.

East Piece Goods

White goods were all trending downwards yesterday due to sluggish customer sales. Fine cloth and fine twill continued to drop by 2.5 to 5 corners per piece. The leading fine cloth in the morning market fell to 22 yuan, and the market was slightly higher in the afternoon, but the transaction was sparse. The dyed sales and industry traders in the entire Japanese street were only dealing with 500 to 600 pieces.

Export

On the 5th, 21 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Yantai, and 871 pieces were shipped to Tianjin.

### Sugar Market: Raw Sugar Has Arrived in Shanghai, Foreign Sugar Transactions Turn Prosperous

According to the Dutch telegram, the price of raw white sugar that is being loaded is up to 9.70 Dutch guilders. Hong Kong telegram says that the set price of "B" Mark "Car White" sugar is 15.75 Hong Kong dollars. The association's plate was initially flat and then tight, and the situation was better. Transactions have also increased. The spot price of "24 Raw White" sugar is 54 yuan in this warehouse and 52.5 yuan in other warehouses, later reaching 54 yuan, with a total turnover of 7800 packages. Transit goods are at a small discount of four corners, and 400 packages were traded at 40.6 yuan. The price of "Taigu Car White" B Mark East Warehouse is still 57.8 yuan, and the West Warehouse was initially 58 yuan, then rose to 8 yuan and a half, with a total turnover of 1,200 packages. The remaining marks are refunded as usual. "H" Mark "Jun Chi" is 42.7 yuan, up one yuan, Dutch Red is 43.5 yuan, up five corners. Local cotton white sugar is up one yuan, No. 1 is 55 yuan, No. 2 is 54.5 yuan, No. 3 is 54 yuan, and No. 4 is 53.5 yuan. Local ice sugar is up by the same degree, No. 1 is 66.5 yuan, and "Jingming" ice sugar is 68 yuan. A total of 6,000 to 7,000 packages of local Xinghua red and white "Mountain God Guang Yongli" etc. have been shipped and are being reported. The number of plates will inevitably be slightly loose, and there will be a formal market soon.

### Seafood: Dried Scallops and Mussels See Sharp Rise

Dried Scallops: Due to the scarcity of sources and the strong sales, the market situation has risen sharply. Recently, Ningbo goods are sold at 40 yuan, an increase of 56 yuan compared to before. Zhoushan goods are even rarer, at 80 yuan, and Yantai goods are 75 yuan, an increase of more than 10 yuan.

Mussels: Also due to the lack of arrivals, the current market price for small mussels is 170 yuan, and for those from Shangzhuang is 200 yuan. If they are slightly larger, three or four "gong" already require 220 yuan, an increase of about 560 yuan.

### North-South Goods: Hainan Longan Rises by 10 Yuan

Hainan Longan: Recently, due to the limited number of arrivals, the market situation has tightened again. Yesterday, the number of plates for high-quality goods opened at 128 yuan, which is nearly 10 yuan higher than before. There are still some guest goods in the guarding. If there are no more arrivals in the later market, it is still expected to tighten again.

### Hardware: White Lead Wire Prices Rise Late and Sales are Stagnant

The white lead wire market is gradually improving along with the new lead wire. Local manufacturers have no interest in buying and foreign merchants rarely inquire, so the market is very clear. However, due to the high cost of arrivals, the industry holders of this product are asking for prices that are more than 34 yuan higher than before. For example, No. 1 to No. 6 are sold at 40 yuan per load, No. 7 to No. 10 are priced at 42 yuan, No. 12 to No. 16 are priced at 45 yuan, No. 17 is 46 yuan, No. 18 is 48 yuan, No. 19 is 49 yuan, and No. 20 is priced at 50 yuan.

### Coal: Haifeng White Coal is Forcibly Calming

Since Hongji's price drop a few days ago, people's hearts and market sentiment have declined, leading to a standstill in transactions. Buyers are all watching. However, Haifeng white coal, which is used by restaurants and stoves, has to be forcibly calmed because the sellers have thrown out too many empty bills of lading. It is heard that the storefronts send customers every ton at 140 yuan, and every basket at 17.5 yuan, adding car force to customers as appropriate.

### Transactions are Light, Cotton Prices are Difficult to Loosen

The transaction of current cotton has slightly reduced in color. The purchasing appetite of factories is not as fresh as it was the previous day, and only Shenxin and Xinsheng factories purchased a little. Other factories did not do much. The buying and selling between fellow traders is also light. Cotton prices still cannot be loosened, because the selling price of seed cotton in the countryside is already high, transportation on the road is difficult, and donations and taxes are heavy, which increases the cost of transportation merchants. Therefore, the situation is still firm. There were no arrivals from Subei in the morning, and 1,300 packages arrived in Shanghai in the afternoon. 600 packages arrived in Changyinsha in the morning and 1,500 packages in the afternoon. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.

### British Merchant Ships on the Far East Route Have Been Ordered to be Equipped with Weapons, Queen Ships Have Been Equipped, Each Ship is Equipped with Giant Guns and Anti-Aircraft Guns, British Navy Issued a Ban on Merchant Ships, Singapore Has Implemented Inspection

In addition to the strict protection of the ships by the Far East Fleet, the British merchant ships sailing on the Far East route are also implementing an armed merchant ship policy, prohibiting the public from announcing the sailing dates of the ships and issuing a ban on merchant ships sailing at sea. The details are as follows:

Implementing Armed Merchant Ship Policy

British merchant ships sailing on the Far East route, such as Changxing, Taikoo, and Jardine Matheson, etc., after being ordered to implement the armed merchant ship policy, today the Queen, Asia Queen, Canada Queen, and other ships have been fully equipped. Each ship is equipped with two anti-aircraft guns and two giant guns. The armament of each ship is installed in London and other places. The gun positions are usually hidden and not easily exposed unless necessary. The Singapore Naval Dockyard has been ordered to undertake the armed equipment of each merchant ship. As for the smaller Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships sailing along the Chinese coast, they have not yet had this kind of armament preparation. The purpose of the installation is to protect the safety of navigation in peacetime, and to provide the government with micro-use in necessary times, and to undertake military transportation.

Issuing a Ban on Merchant Ships Sailing

The British Navy issued a ban on merchant ships, (1) Without the order of the chief officer, no wireless electricity shall be sent, no reply shall be made to any report, no report shall be sent by wireless electricity, and no report shall be made by wireless electricity to foreign war personnel about the dangers of water mines or other defenses, but wireless electric warnings may be sent if the safety is enforced; (2) All British merchant ships, when at sea, must reduce or dim the navigation lights at night, extinguish all lights inside the ship, and try to reach the port at dawn, and avoid approaching armed areas at sea; (3) From September 5, all ships must not pass through the east and west banks of the Gambia River. The above-mentioned ban has been notified to the licenses of all British merchant ships by the Straits Settlements Shipping Office.

Singapore Inspects Incoming Ships

Singapore has implemented the inspection of incoming ships, and the methods are as follows: (1) All incoming ships that want to enter the port of Singapore must first sail to the Kusu Island Inspection Office to moor, and can only enter the pilot after being inspected; (2) From today, the pilot system will be implemented for those entering or leaving the harbor, and the pilot launch will be stationed near Kusu Island; (3) All ships that want to enter the wave-breaking dike must first sail to the inspection office. After the goods are unloaded, they must sail from Sitang Xinji to the west to the south, and then pass through the Great Island (4) Before the ship arrives at the inspection office, the special flag must continue to be flown. The inspection ship is blue, with a special inspection flag hanging high on the bow. At night, three white lights are hung high on the ship, each about six feet apart. This inspection is to prevent the entry of enemy spies and dangerous goods into the area.

British and French Cruise Ships Postponed to Shanghai

The schedule of ships is most accurate with postal ships. Except for accidents that are beyond human control, there is no delay at any time. However, recently, due to the impact of the European War, the voyage schedules of postal ships of the belligerent countries have also been inaccurate. In addition, because each company strictly keeps the import and export schedules secret, the outside world is unusually isolated. Here is the recent postal ship dynamics record. The Russian Queen of Changxing Company decided to come to Shanghai from Vancouver. According to the schedule, it should have arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month and sailed to Nanyang on the 3rd. It only arrived yesterday morning and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. It is scheduled to set sail from today to Hong Kong and Xiaoluson. The French Postal Ship Company's Felix Roussel postal ship should have arrived in Shanghai on the 29th of last month. The scheduled change is today to import, also stopped at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. It is said that the ship will not go to Japan this time, but will stay in Shanghai for a few days and return to Europe on the 10th. The new postal ship of the Dutch Java Postal Ship Company, Zhizhayun Jia, has an accurate schedule. The third decision to come to Shanghai arrived the day before yesterday (2nd) and is now moored at the 13th and 14th pontoons to load goods. It is scheduled to set sail this afternoon and return to Java.

### Japanese Radio Station Disrupts American Broadcasting

Dalu News reported that yesterday (3rd), according to foreign residents who are equipped with wireless electricity in this port, a new Japanese radio station was established, broadcasting news in English for the past two nights, completely disrupting the news broadcast by the United States from San Francisco Baodao. The call signs of the Japanese radio station are JZK and JZJ. When the United States began broadcasting news to the East, it began broadcasting at the same time, and its radio waves were the same as the radio waves legally maintained by the San Francisco American General Electric Company, so that Shanghai could not receive the American news broadcast. The Japanese radio station also interfered with the news broadcasts transmitted from London via Hong Kong. American residents in Shanghai who like to receive American news broadcasts from San Francisco are now urging the American Consul General in Shanghai to pay attention to the Japanese radio station and immediately write to Ms. Smith, the American trade commissioner. Before yesterday evening, Ms. Smith had prepared an official detailed report and sent it to Washington, urging the relevant American authorities to pay attention to this matter.

The Huajun is Active on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, the Longtan Railway Track is Bombed, Locomotives and Freight Cars are Overturned and Traffic is Interrupted, and the Japanese Army Suffered Another Terrible Defeat in the Yangshuyuan Area

Due to the activity of the Huafang guerrillas along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, the railway track was destroyed twice and vehicles overturned last month. It is reported that near Longtan Station on the 2nd of this month, another freight car was bombed and derailed, causing traffic on the Nanjing-Shanghai road to be blocked again. The details are as follows:

Longtan Railway Track is Bombed

On the 12th of last month, the railway track between Xinfeng and Zhaze was destroyed. Following that, on the evening of the 28th, the Huafang guerrillas installed anti-mines between Henglin and Qishuyan, causing a train full of military cargo to overturn. The Japanese also confirmed these two incidents, but did not announce the extent of the losses. Yesterday, it was reported that on the morning of the 2nd, a freight car departing from Nanjing was traveling near Longtan Station when the railway track was suddenly bombed, causing the locomotive coal water car and three freight cars loaded with wheat to overturn at a small bridge near the site. As a result, passenger cars between Nanjing and Shanghai and Japanese military supply cars were again blocked on the day. Although the Japanese tried to repair it, they were temporarily unable to restore traffic due to engineering reasons.

Japanese Army was Annihilated in Yangshuyuan Town, the Japanese Army realized that there were occasional accidents along the line, and after the Henglin vehicles derailed, they tried to investigate all the clues of the landmine, and then sent a team to search the area south of the canal. On the 27th, they met the Huajun Self-Defense Regiment near Hutai in Wuxi County, and opened fire for two hours. The Japanese army immediately retreated because they were outnumbered. On the 30th, 30 or 40 Japanese troops from Luoshe took a ship to Yangshuyuan Town to search. The matter was learned by Zhou Hanliang, the special task force of the West District of the Huajun Self-Defense Regiment, and immediately led his troops, Xu Meichu and others, to meet them and opened fire at the Shao of North Street. The Japanese army was caught off guard. As a result, a Japanese small ship was sunk, 20 Japanese soldiers were killed, 5 were captured, and the rest were injured. The next day, the town was set on fire by the Japanese army and several houses were burned down.

Attempting to Entice the People to Protect the Road

According to reports from the Dakwangshe reporter yesterday who inquired about the transportation industry, the Japanese are quite anxious because the Nanjing-Shanghai transportation is often damaged, so they set up a so-called "Road Loving Class" by the "Huajun Railway Company", with a Japanese named Inamoto as the head of the class, trying to persuade residents along the line to jointly maintain the railway, and at 7:12 a.m. the day before yesterday, a special car was sent from the North Station, full of a large number of daily necessities, and Inamoto was in charge of directing the train to sell various items at low prices at stations along the line, taking the opportunity to promote to the people and persuade them to jointly maintain railway traffic, and report to the stations at any time if they find someone destroying it. However, the general public knows the righteousness, and most of them despise the Japanese move, and they only see the Japanese's hard work and failure.

### Armed Japanese Students Were Blocked from Passing Through the French Defense Zone, Stalemate for Two Hours, French Army Did Not Accommodate, Then Allowed to Pass by the British Army to Return to School

The English Damei Evening News reported that 100 Japanese students from the Dōbun Shoin, each carrying a rifle, departed from the school building on Haig Road on Sunday in a parade and headed towards the Hongqiao Golf Club area. Without permission, they passed through the British military defense zone on their own. When they returned to school, they attempted to pass through the French military defense zone, but the French army did not allow it, because they had not obtained permission either. These students waited outside the French military defense zone for two hours, and finally the British army came out to mediate and escorted the Japanese army through the British military defense zone to return. However, they were prohibited from passing through the British military defense zone again in a military parade. Japanese newspapers in this port today criticized the French side for summoning two armored vehicles and machine gun teams. The school building of Jiaotong University in the Dōbun Shoin was destroyed in 1937 when the Chinese army retreated, so the school building is now located there. Although the Dōbun Shoin school building is outside the boundary road, it is actually outside the British military defense zone and the original French military defense zone. However, Japanese newspapers criticized the French army for "not effectively defending the school building in 1937." The Japanese students paraded in a military parade on Haig Road and Lujiazai Road on Sunday. Although Japanese newspapers said that the students were not carrying military equipment, they were actually carrying rifles. Although these people did not ask the British authorities for permission to pass in a parade, the British army still allowed them to exit the defense zone. On the way back, the Japanese students attempted to pass through the area taken over by the French army after the Chinese army withdrew in 1937 and return to school via Hongqiao Road. The French sentries did not allow them to enter the country, because they had not obtained a parade

Pass Permit

Also, the Japanese students did not attempt to return to the original route through the British military defense zone, the French army then asked them to leave their weapons behind before granting permission, but the Japanese students refused to comply. After a long stalemate, following the advice of the British army officer, they returned to school via the British military defense zone. The British military commander of Shanghai, Major General Simons, then received a thank you from the Japanese military commander of the area.

### The Puppet "Unified Tax Bureau" is Scheduled to be Handed Over on Double Ten Festival

Shao Shijun, the "Director" of the "Unified Tax Bureau of the Three Provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui" under Japanese control, has accumulated a lot of wealth since taking office. The puppet "Vichy Government" has repeatedly thought of getting its hands on this lucrative position, but to no avail. It has recently been learned that the "Bureau" will be handed over to the jurisdiction of the "Vichy Government" on the Double Ten Festival. It is said that the Nanjing puppet organization has sent puppet officials from Nanjing by car to Shanghai to handle the handover matters.

### American Asiatic Fleet Commander Hord Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, McReynolds Plans a Formal Banquet to Welcome Him, Plans to Visit the South China Sea for Inspection in Mid-November

The flagship of the American Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, bearing the three-star admiral's flag, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 4th) at 3:00 PM from Qingdao. It is anchored in the river near the new Customs Wharf and plans to stay in Shanghai for a month. In mid-November, it will proceed to the South China Sea for its customary winter inspection. After Admiral Hord arrived in Shanghai, he has not yet visited the American Consul General Gauss, nor has he received any guests. However, according to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the US Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, the McReynolds Detachment, has scheduled a grand banquet at the French Club on the 12th of this month to welcome Admiral Hord and his staff. The McReynolds Detachment is also preparing for a parade in the Racecourse, to be inspected by Admiral Hord. At that time, senior American officials stationed in Shanghai, as well as foreign military officers and commanders stationed in Shanghai, may be invited to observe the parade. As for the foreign warships outside the Huangpu River, since the successive departures of the American warship Marblehead, and the British warships Grasshopper and Dragonfly, they have become sparse. Yesterday, due to the arrival of the flagship Augusta, the scene became spectacular again.

Adopting Active Measures Hereafter

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, an officer of the American Asiatic Fleet stated this morning (the 4th) that the American authorities are now adopting more forceful methods than those announced earlier this week. In the future, no information about the movements of American warships in the Far East will be disclosed. This latest order also applies to the wives of naval personnel, who will only be notified when the warships actually arrive. Regarding the flagship of the Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Qingdao at 3:00 PM this afternoon, no changes have been announced. However, whether the Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Hord, arrived in Shanghai aboard the Augusta, or remained on his private yacht, the Isabel, could not be ascertained due to the latest order announced this morning, as the authorities have not released the Isabel's planned itinerary.

### Philipps Denies Continued Negotiations with the Puppet Regime, News in Japanese Newspaper Completely Groundless, Shanghai Municipal Council Declares It Will Not Relinquish Rights, Japanese Puppets Occupy More Houses

Negotiations regarding the issue of road construction beyond the boundaries of the Settlement have recently been conducted by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the British Defense Forces authorities, the Japanese side, and the puppet municipal government. Due to a major point of contention, the military authorities are unwilling to concede, causing the negotiations to become deadlocked. Meanwhile, the actions of the Japanese puppet regime in Western Shanghai are becoming increasingly bizarre. After setting up numerous puppet police stations, encroaching on police posts, and managing traffic, many houses were occupied yesterday, causing panic among nearby residents. Many have been considering moving away as the best option, posing a hidden threat to the Settlement issue. How this will develop in the future is difficult to predict. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council made a solemn statement yesterday: (1) it will not relinquish its rights to road construction beyond the boundaries of the Settlement; (2) it will not recognize any actions taken by the puppet regime in that area. The details are recorded below.

Authorities Determined Not to Relinquish Rights

A spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council stated on the 4th, "The Shanghai Municipal Council has no intention of relinquishing its rights to road construction beyond the boundaries of the Settlement. Although the facts show that the [Japanese] side and the puppet police are indeed challenging these rights, the Council is still in negotiations with the Japanese puppet regime, but these are currently deadlocked. The stationing of puppet police along the roads beyond the boundaries of the Settlement and the requirement that residents of the area pay house taxes to the puppet municipal government will not be recognized by the Shanghai Municipal Council." A reporter from the Datong News Agency also learned from reliable sources that this issue will soon be closely discussed by the Shanghai Municipal Council and the leaders of the defense forces of various countries within the Public Settlement. However, all parties involved have maintained a firm silence, so the details could not be disclosed.

Philip Has Not Met Recently

A Western newspaper reporter visited Philip, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, yesterday to inquire about the progress of negotiations regarding road construction beyond the boundaries of the Settlement. Philip refuted the Japanese spokesperson's claim that Philip had recently met with the puppet mayor, Chuan Xiao'an. Philip stated, "We met in the city center a month ago. Since then, we have not met. What the Japanese spokesperson is referring to may be the event a month ago." When asked about the Japanese side's request for the Shanghai Municipal Council to allow them to lease the slaughterhouse on Zhaoqin Road, Philip said, "This case must be decided after discussion by the Board of Directors. The content of the Japanese request cannot be disclosed at this time. However, this matter is very important because most of the meat supply for the Settlement comes from that slaughterhouse." The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury also reported that Philip, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, refuted the remarks made recently by a Japanese spokesperson at a press conference this morning (the 4th). According to Philip's statement to reporters, since he and Mayor Chuan Xiao'an met in the city center a month ago, no further meetings have been held. The Japanese spokesperson may be referring to the meeting held a month ago. Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council receiving an application from certain private Japanese parties to lease the Shanghai Municipal Council slaughterhouse on Zhaoqin Road, Philip stated that this matter must be submitted for discussion at the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting. The details of the Japanese application could not be disclosed this morning, but Philip considered this matter to be quite important at present because most of the meat supplied to the Public Settlement comes from this slaughterhouse.

Puppet Consolidated Tax Bureau Established in Western Shanghai

Number 11, Jessfield Road, was originally the clubhouse of the Hanyeping Coal and Iron Company. After the "August 13th" Incident, the Cilian Relief Society established the 31st Refugee Shelter there. Since it was occupied by the Japanese puppet regime on the 9th of last month, no incidents had occurred, except for the transfer of a portion of the building for the use of the Japanese puppet regime. However, yesterday, the shelter suddenly received a notice from the landlord, stating that the building had been leased to a puppet organization to set up a Consolidated Tax Bureau and that they were required to vacate the entire building within three days. Upon hearing this news, the refugees were filled with sorrow, but there was no way to reverse the situation, and they could only lament their helplessness.

Western-Style Residence Occupied Yesterday

On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, more than a hundred Japanese military police and puppet police, traveling in trucks, arrived at Number 99, Jessfield Road (west of Connaught Road), and occupied the residence, evicting all the residents. However, the 33rd Refugee Shelter of the Cilian Relief Society, which was attached to the building, was not interfered with. Yesterday, approximately twenty more Japanese military police and puppet police were added. Currently, four military police are guarding the main gate, and a side gate has been opened for refugees to enter and exit. It has been verified that the building is a Western-style residence located diagonally opposite the Western District Command of the Japanese military police, with a large square inside.

Special Service Team, Third Brigade Established

Number 1103, Connaught Road (near Jin Situ Temple), originally the Sheng family property, has been sealed off by the court for a long time. Recently, the Cilian Relief Society built three new reed mat sheds on the vacant land inside for use as the 34th Refugee Shelter. Yesterday morning, the building (which is in excellent condition) was suddenly occupied by the so-called "Third Brigade of the Special Service Headquarters." The entire team consisted of over a hundred members, most of whom were dressed in plain clothes. Those who were armed wore grass-green uniforms, leggings, and round straw hats with the Blue Sky White Sun emblem in the center. It is evident that they belong to the same organization as the headquarters established at Number 121, Route Tenant de la Tour (inside Gan Gong Elementary School).

School Forced to Close

The Qian Cao South Elementary School at Number 93, Route Tenant de la Tour, was not only used as the 3rd refugee shelter of the Cilian Relief Society, but it also ran a popular literacy school. A group calling themselves the "Shanghai Special Municipality, Western Shanghai Caojiadu Self-Defense Corps" went there the other day to occupy the premises and forced the school to relinquish them. When the school refused, the group piled a large number of hand grenades and Mauser rifles in the classrooms. Unable to maintain operations, the school has already closed down. However, the refugee shelter has not yet been affected.

### Japanese Banks Sell Off Vigorously, Foreign Exchange Tightens, Rumors Resurface in the Market, Black Market Gold Prices Soar

The Shanghai foreign exchange, gold, and securities markets have been subject to severe fluctuations due to speculation and profiteering. Recently, with the gradual dissipation of market rumors and the stabilization of public sentiment, the black market for foreign exchange eased, the black market price of gold fell back, and the securities market experienced a sharp rise in national bonds. The entire financial situation improved uniformly. Yesterday, the market experienced a sharp contraction in foreign exchange as Japanese banks vigorously sold off foreign exchange and rumors spread simultaneously. The British exchange rate was 4.4375, and the US exchange rate was 7.375. As a result, the black market price of gold soared due to the sharp contraction in foreign exchange. The morning closing price was 4,047 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 4,058 yuan. The black market for securities saw continued weakness in the Unified Public Bonds. The afternoon closing prices were: Class A, 53.55 yuan; Class B, 46.70 yuan; Class C, 46.25 yuan; Class D, 45.00 yuan; and Class E, 45.55 yuan.

### Portuguese National Day Commemoration

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury, the Portuguese Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Melo, and his wife have invited the local Portuguese community to attend a garden party at Number 15, Rue Joffre, from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM tomorrow (the 5th) to celebrate the 29th anniversary of the declaration of the Portuguese Republic.

### Military Performance in Western Shanghai Under Japanese Command, Organized to Protect Yamada and Others Visiting Wang, Tense Situation Completely Resolved Yesterday

According to the Continental Times, "Great Way" police officers, armed and in full military attire, were stationed along Yu Yuan Road yesterday (the 3rd) to protect the guests invited by Wang Jingwei, turning the "Wild West" area of Western Shanghai into an armed camp. The "Great Way" police, under Japanese command, engaged in this kind of military performance, causing some alarm to the outside world and giving rise to many astonishing and absurd rumors throughout the day. However, the special patrol of the "Great Way" police had mostly withdrawn by last night, and Yu Yuan Road had returned to its peaceful and normal state. The purpose of this unprecedented show of force yesterday was because a team of Japanese military officers, led by Lieutenant General Yamada, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese forces in Central China, went to the heavily guarded residence of Wang Jingwei on Yu Yuan Road to have lunch with several officials of the new "Kuomintang." The military performance began before 11:00 AM, when a column of about fifteen cars carrying Japanese military officers traveled along Nanjing Road via Jing'an Temple Road to Wang's residence.

Each car

was escorted by Japanese soldiers on motorcycles, and junior Japanese officers with guns in hand. Armed detectives from the Public Settlement Police Department also accompanied them for protection. Before the motorcade reached the intersection of Yu Yuan Road and Jing'an Temple Road, "Great Way" police officers in dark green military uniforms practiced saluting under the command of police officers and Japanese supervisors. The new "Great Way" police underwent a final minute of inspection as the cars carrying Wang's guests were about to arrive.

From the intersection of

Jing'an Temple Road, armed "Great Way" police officers were stationed every fifteen yards along both sides of Yu Yuan Road, saluting as the cars passed. The banquet at the residence began to disperse at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The Japanese military officers and their armed teams returned to headquarters via Yu Yuan Road. The "Great Way" police once again guarded the roadside.

Socialist League Theater

News last night stated that when Yamada arrived at Wang's residence, he was welcomed by a "guard of honor" composed of young members of the "Dare to Die Corps" of the new "Kuomintang," hired by Wang. Yesterday morning, the "Great Way" police were concentrated in front of the Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade, with the largest number, eighty, lined up in a team. It is estimated that more than two hundred puppet police officers were deployed yesterday.

### Three Indian Youths Travel the World Together, Departed from Mumbai Seven Years Ago by Bicycle, Passed Through Dozens of Countries, Now Arriving in Shanghai, Carrying Indian Goodwill to the World

According to the Continental Times, three Indian youths, who set off from Mumbai seven years ago, are traveling the world by bicycle. Climbing mountains, crossing deserts, enduring heat and cold, and experiencing hardships, they have traveled through six continents and dozens of countries. Yesterday (the 3rd), they arrived in Shanghai and will take the route through Australia and East India to return home in 1943. According to Mr. Khara, the leader of the three, who is 36 years old and an insurance salesman, his companions Gandhi, 32, and Xu Luofu, 31, are both electrical engineers. All three of them hope to become educators, so the purpose of this trip is not to sell insurance but to carry Indian knowledge and goodwill to various countries around the world and bring back a broader knowledge of other nations to benefit their compatriots.

They Have Used Up Eight Tires

According to Mr. Khara's statement to reporters yesterday, they feel that they have gained a great deal that can be utilized in India, but they have certainly not obtained everything, as learning is endless. To date, they have used up eight bicycle tires and two bicycles. They do not know how many more tires they will use up traveling through the Philippines and Australia. However, they are confident that their specially made bicycles are strong and durable. They plan to stay in Shanghai for about two weeks and then take a boat to Hong Kong.

Published a Book in England

Mr. Khara and his group started their journey seven years ago and first entered the mountainous country of Afghanistan, where they were received and entertained by the country's monarch. They then went to Iran, Turkey, and the Balkan Peninsula countries. By the end of 1935, they had traveled through most of Europe. However, due to the long journey, they were short of funds and had to make a living by giving lectures and writing articles for magazines. While in England, they published a book describing the latest experiences of their journey.

Encountered War on the Way from Europe to Africa

When they went from Europe to Africa, Italy was invading Abyssinia in central Africa. The three of them had to travel around the borders of Abyssinia. Although they encountered many refugees fleeing the war along the way, they did not encounter bandits. However, one night they had to take refuge in a thorny tree due to a herd of elephants passing by, and they were uneasy all night. Then they packed their bags and set off from Cape Town in South Africa, heading to Argentina and South America, and took a boat to Panama City, followed by Jamaica, Cuba, Mexico, the United States, and Canada in the West Indies.

Backward Nations Are Openhearted

They have decided to return home. On the way, in addition to Australia, they will also pass through the Malay Peninsula, Java, and Burma. Each traveler carries luggage weighing an average of 120 pounds, containing tents, blankets, stoves, cooking utensils, and typewriters. When a reporter asked Khara yesterday what he had been most impressed with during the entire journey, Khara replied without hesitation, "Generous treatment." It seems that hospitality depends on the state of civilization. Backward nations are very openhearted, but their hospitality is slightly inferior to that of more civilized nations. Khara and his party are being hosted by the Indian Zoroastrian community here and will give a lecture at 6:00 PM on the 11th of this month.

### French Police Bureau Cracks Down on Lottery Dens, All Criminals Severely Punished

After the lottery king Mao Axiang and Li Xiaobao, etc., established the Yiji Lottery Headquarters in Caojiadu under the protection of a certain faction, they secretly dispatched their henchmen to set up listening posts and "boats" in the two settlements. Their business was quite prosperous, and even after the police authorities of the two settlements severely arrested them, it was still difficult to achieve results. Recently, a Ningbo native named Yu Minggao was assigned to set up a large-scale lottery organization at Number 7, Lane 126, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, and distributed his accomplices at Number 1, Lane 400, Rue Conty; Number 110, Route Ratard; Number 7, Lane 237, Avenue Alber; and a bungalow at Number 270, Route Frelupt, to set up "boats" and listening posts, specializing in enticing ordinary people to participate. This was discovered by the Gambling Arrest Squad of the French Police Bureau. On the morning of the 2nd of this month at approximately 11:00 AM, a large number of Chinese and Western detectives, including Detectives Liu Kunbao, Quan Wenwei, Zhang Jianyun, Zhang Huaiqi, and Chen Tinghuai, rushed to the addresses and arrested the main culprits Yu Minggao, Wu Chongzhou, Jiang Dequan, Sun Xizi, Ling Shanglian, and Zhou Panqin. More than three hundred yuan in gambling funds and a large number of lottery tickets were confiscated and taken to the police station, and then transferred to the Second Special Court. After interrogation, each was sentenced to six months imprisonment.

The kidnapping for ransom was unsuccessful, and Xue was shot to death. Afterwards, Hou went into hiding at the Liangxi Hostel on Hubei Road in Shanghai. On the morning of August 2nd, he was encountered by the deceased's wife, Xue Dai, who called for his arrest. He was brought to the First Special Court for trial and detained, pending a further trial after the High Court designated jurisdiction. It is now learned that the High Court has designated the First Special Court to handle the case. Therefore, yesterday, the police station continued to send the accused Hou Genxiang to the Criminal Division of the court to be prosecuted for murder. Judge Feng presided over the interrogation. The accused's testimony was cunning, and he was returned to detention pending further investigation and interrogation.

### Tenants in Yuqing Lane Oppose Landlord's Rent Increase

Yuqing Lane on Robison Road and Moab Road in the Public Settlement has more than eighty houses. The landlord, New Sassoon & Co., recently announced that it would increase the rent by 30% from September, citing increased land damage and water costs. Otherwise, they would ask the tenants to move out. The entire group of tenants then convened a meeting a few days ago and established a Tenants' Union. Yesterday, they commissioned lawyers Qian Shusheng and Wang Xian'gu to send a letter to the landlord, requesting that it withdraw the order to increase the rent.

### Li Tong Returns to the Philippines Today After Visiting Shanghai to Investigate National Products

Li Tong, a Chinese businessman from Nanyang who came to Shanghai to investigate national products, is scheduled to return to Manila in the Philippines today on the Chiginigara wheel. More than thirty national product manufacturers, including Shanghai Taiyi Malt Extract Powder Factory, Yong'anxiang Store, and Taikang Canned Food Company, have jointly organized a farewell.

### Gasoline Barge Carelessly Catches Fire, Japanese Oil Completely Destroyed, Intended for Use by the Central China Automobile Company, One Boat Saved, the Other Sank

According to the Continental Times, at around 7:00 PM on Sunday night, a cargo ship carrying gasoline suddenly caught fire in the Huangpu River near the Asiatic Petroleum Company's oil station. The flames were raging, illuminating the Huangpu River. The ship then sank. It was found that the cargo ship was carrying Japanese-made gasoline, intended for use by the Central China Metropolitan Automobile Transportation Company, which is run by the Japanese. It is said that the fire was caused by the smoke from the shipmaster's cooking stove.

The English-language Shanghai Evening Post & Mercury also reported that detectives from the Water Police Department are still investigating the cause of the major fire on Sunday night involving two gasoline barges in the Huangpu River, but have not yet discovered the reason. After the two barges carelessly caught fire at 9:00 PM, the fire boat Hu Ning immediately sailed to extinguish the blaze. However, the flames were so intense that the Hu Ning had to spray water from a distance. After an hour and twenty minutes of firefighters' efforts, one barge was eventually saved, but the other was completely destroyed.

### Reckless Police Officer, Assaults Women, The Assault Occurred When an Attempt to Harass a Woman Failed, The Two Police Officers Have Been Dismissed, and the Woman Has Filed a Lawsuit After Undergoing a Medical Examination

Zhang Qiu, a widow from Fujian residing at Number 81, Anshun Lane, Route Conty in the French Concession, is forty years old. Her late husband served under Du Xigui, the former Minister of the Navy, and was an officer in the Naval Survey Bureau. On the afternoon of the 26th of last month, at 8:30 PM, Qiu, accompanied by her eighteen-year-old daughter, Xiuyun, was returning home from Rue Moliere. As they walked in front of Number 307 at the intersection of Route Conty and Rue Bayle, a reckless Chinese police officer with badge number 1118 (name unknown)

Reached Out His Hand

to touch Qiu's shoulder and caress her face, making frivolous advances. Qiu rebuked him. The police officer, feeling ashamed and enraged, used his police baton to beat her all over her body. He also summoned his companion, a Russian police officer with badge number 9, to help with the assault. Qiu's daughter, who was standing beside her, was greatly shocked by the sight. Unable to help her mother resist and not daring to shout for help, she ran home and brought her neighbor, Mrs. Huang Wang, to drag Qiu home. Qiu was

Covered with Injuries. The next day, she reported the incident to the police station, requesting a thorough investigation. After questioning, the police chief ordered that the victim be sent to the hospital for examination, which confirmed that she had been injured. The Chinese and Russian police officers who caused the incident were then dismissed, without further prosecution. Thereupon, Zhang Qiu submitted a written statement to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special Court, requesting a medical examination and then filing a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing the Chinese police officer with badge number 1118 and the Russian police officer with badge number 9 of assault and battery, requesting that they be prosecuted according to law. The court accepted the statement, and Judge Jiang Fengquan opened the trial yesterday morning. The accused did not appear. Only the plaintiff, Zhang Qiu, appeared. After questioning her about her age and origin, the judge ordered the court police to send the summons to the police station, but because both accused had been dismissed, it was impossible to deliver the summons. The hearing was rescheduled to the 11th of this month to investigate the case and summon the accused to appear for interrogation.

### Head Injured by Falling Iron Plate

Xu Sansan, a local resident, aged twenty, used to work as a sailor on the Shanghai Electric Power Company's No. 5 small steamer. He was recently dismissed from his job due to some incident. Yesterday at 10:15 AM, Xu, having nothing to do, went to the ship in Yangshupu to visit a friend. While they were chatting, a piece of iron plate from the top of the ship's flagpole suddenly fell down, striking Xu directly on the head. He was seriously injured, and his head was covered in blood. He was taken to the Hudong Hospital for treatment by car.

Woman Jumps from Building

At 12:30 PM yesterday afternoon, Mrs. Huang Xu (30 years old), a resident of Number 455, Racecourse Road, Public Settlement, jumped to her death from the second floor of her home, for reasons unknown. She fell to the ground and was seriously injured. Her family discovered her and took her to the hospital by car. It is reported that her injuries are extremely serious.

### Renowned Doctor Qin Bowen Sued for Rent, Defendant Requests Payment in Installments

Renowned Shanghai physician and expert in gynecology, Qin Bowen, rented a house at No. 2 An Village, at the corner of Route des Soeurs, Rue Amiral Bayle, and Avenue Edouard VII in the French Concession from Zhengda Company on June 12 of this year. He intended to establish the Western District branch of his Chinese medicine sanatorium under a long-term lease. Apart from the rent already paid, he still owed 4,000 national currency. Due to being troubled by the Ministry of Finance's Ma Dian Stabilization Financial Measures, he was unable to withdraw bank deposits to pay.

Therefore, another contract was drawn up, pledging the lease right of the house as collateral, with a deadline for paying off or settling the full amount in installments before August 1 of this year. However, after the contract was signed, only 200 legal tender was paid, along with a draft of 300 yuan. After deducting the discount, the creditor only received 261 yuan and 50 cents, leaving a balance of 3,538 yuan and 50 cents. As Qin failed to deliver the payment by the deadline, and after unsuccessful reminders, the creditor, Zhengda Company, through its legal representative Tong Tiyan, requested the Special Second Court to issue a

payment order, urging the debtor Qin Bowen to repay the arrears. Due to objections raised in the case, the debt remained unfulfilled. As a result, Zhengda Company appointed lawyers Li Guozhen and Li Yujun to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Special Second Court against Qin Bowen to recover the rent. Based on the complaint, the court held a hearing yesterday morning presided over by Judge Yu Changzi. Both parties were represented by lawyers. The plaintiff requested the court to order the defendant to

settle the outstanding amount in one lump sum and grant provisional execution. The defendant requested the court to reject the plaintiff's claim and continue with the installment payments previously agreed upon by both parties. There was also a dispute over the deduction of the discount from the 300-yuan draft. Witness Qin Chunfang was also brought to court to testify. After reviewing the situation, the court declared the debate closed and scheduled the verdict for the seventh day.

### Fall from Fourth Floor Results in Death

Jiang Dabao, a 46-year-old plasterer (female), fell from the roof of the four-story building at No. 145 Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession at 9:30 yesterday morning while repairing a leak at the Tongyanxiang Cotton Cloth Store. Due to loss of balance, she fell, hitting her head and dying instantly. Patrol officers reported the incident to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the mortuary for examination.

### Young Traveler Attempts Suicide by Poisoning

A young traveler, whose name was Heng, at No. 2 of the Detai Inn on Zhejiang Road in the International Settlement, suddenly attempted suicide by poisoning in his room at 6:45 yesterday morning. The tea server discovered him and rushed him to the hospital for treatment. Wang Gentao and Sun Tusheng, shop assistants at the Dahua Leather Goods Store on Yuqiaqing Road, stole leather goods worth 140 yuan on January 11 of this year and fled after selling them off. After the owner, Shen Mogu, reported the theft to the police station, they took a pistol with them the next day and went to Shen to intimidate him. Shen jumped out of the building due to fear, injuring his foot, which has not yet fully healed. Afterwards, they wrote

threatening letters

accusing Shen of selling Japanese goods and attempting to extort 500 yuan, threatening to endanger the lives of his entire family. Xue Youwen, a Chinese detective inspector from the Old Gate Police Station, arrested Wang Gentao, Sun Tusheng, and their accomplice Zhou Zhimao and handed them over to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. After being arrested, Wang and others confessed that their theft and intimidation were instigated by Gu Fusheng, the owner of the Zhongxing Leather Goods Workshop at No. 310, Lane 799, Nanjing Road. The police then

investigated Gu. Gu also surrendered to the police and submitted certificates from the Leather Goods Trade Association and the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, proving that he was indeed an upright and legitimate businessman. He claimed that the accusations were malicious slander by Wang and others. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide held a preliminary hearing in the First Criminal Division. Shen Mogu, due to his unhealed foot injury, appointed lawyer Wu Peng to appear in court and filed an incidental civil suit. The defendants also hired lawyers Tao Wuzhi and others to defend them. The police lawyer Ru Baozhen

recounted the incident. The three defendants, Wang and others, were charged with theft under Article 320 of the Criminal Code, and obstruction under Articles 305 and 346 of the same code. It was also alleged that on January 22, they robbed Zhu Xingchang's Leather Goods Workshop at No. 43, Lane 685, Gordon Road, of 20 yuan. Therefore, they were also charged with robbery. It was also stated that regarding the defendants' claim that they were instigated by Gu Fusheng, after a thorough investigation by the police,

the police found that the defendants' confessions were accurate and there was no reason to doubt them and proved their claims were facts. Therefore, it had been decided not to prosecute Gu. Wang Gentao and others confessed to the theft, intimidation, and attempted extortion. After reviewing the confessions, Judge Feng Shide adjourned the case for further hearing.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor, In the local news section on page three of your newspaper on the 2nd of this month, there was a report about a case where the pawnshop manager, Lu Jidong from Anhui, sued the accountant, Xu Hualiang. It was stated that Xu Hualiang currently resides on the second floor of No. 5 Fushou Fang, Huanlong Road. I found this to be very perplexing, as the above address is currently my residence, and there is no one named Xu Hualiang living here. The Special Second Court sent a summons on the 20th of last month, which was signed and returned by the sublessee, Mr. Chen, as proof. Moreover, Lu Jidong is from Chongming. He visited me out of hometown friendship on the 20th of last month and knew that Xu Hualiang did not live here. What was his intention in deliberately misleading the court? In addition to personally reprimanding him, I earnestly request your newspaper to publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Huang Yutao, October 3rd, Address: No. 5 Fushou Fang, Huanlong Road. To the Editor, Regarding the news item published in your newspaper on the 1st of this month, "Hua Wen She" reported that Baotai Pawnshop suffered a fire and refused to compensate, and on the following day, lawyer Wang Heng Gu, representing the pawnshop, sent a letter requesting a correction, stating that my law firm was not involved in the matter. After the Baotai Pawnshop fire, lawyer Wang issued a notice stating that except for a portion of the jewelry that could be redeemed, the pawnshop would not be responsible for the remaining pledged items, citing force majeure. After seeing the notice, the pawnshop customers were unwilling to accept it and came to entrust my law firm to represent them. They requested a notice to be sent to all Baotai Pawnshop customers who had not yet participated in the registration, urging them to register as soon as possible for verification and negotiation. Currently, there are over a hundred registered customers, with pledges amounting to several thousand yuan or more. My law firm has already negotiated with the pawnshop, but there has been no response. We are now preparing to formally proceed according to the law. As for the correction stated by lawyer Wang on behalf of the pawnshop, it is absolutely untrue. I am deeply concerned that it may cause confusion, and I am hereby writing to correct the facts. I hope it will be published in the "Letters to the Editor" section of your newspaper. I eagerly await this. Sincerely, Lawyer Ji Chao, October 4th.

### From "Emotional Expression" to "Thief" (Part 2)

— Xiao Ren

It is permissible to praise those who died for the Ming Dynasty, and even to mourn the Ming emperors, because the "Great Qing" also encourages loyal subjects and wants to show the "magnanimity" of "our dynasty." This can be understood by looking at how the Qing Shizu is said to have cried at Chongzhen's imperial tomb in the "History of the Ming Dynasty." However, there is one thing that the "Great Qing" considers most important: you must vigorously denounce the cruelty of the "thieves," because that way everyone will remember that the "Great Qing" quelled the internal rebellion, and it will also show that it was the "thieves" who destroyed the Ming Dynasty, not the "Great Qing." But this policy happened to suit the tastes of those "recluses" of the early Qing Dynasty. Some of those "recluses" actually lived on the Qing dynasty's official salaries, so this method was extremely suitable for their status: on the one hand, they expressed their loyalty to the previous dynasty, and on the other hand, they did not offend "our dynasty." Therefore, they tried their best to dress the Qing soldiers in ceremonial robes and paint the "thieves" with flowery faces in their writings.

However, the "thieves" did not give up fighting for the fallen Ming Dynasty. The "righteous people" of the time, although disdained by our current young literary men, were, after all, figures who sacrificed themselves for the nation. But the masses they summoned were the restless peasants, who were also the "thieves" who were always spoken of, and in fact, many of them came from Li Zicheng's ranks. The "thieves" were not the kind of "robbers" we have always understood who only knew how to kill and set fires.

But our young literary men insist on faithfully copying the writings of the "recluses" of the early Qing Dynasty. Apart from making people think that they are inheriting the literary tradition of the "emotional expression" school of literary men, one cannot imagine what other purpose there is.

What the consequences will be for these literary men in the future is still "under observation," let us see what the facts will be in the future.

### Printing Workers in the Yan'an Border Region

— Ye Fen

A Glimpse of Life in Twenty-Four Hours

The night has not yet faded completely, and the sunlight has already revealed a corner of its head. A few charming rosy clouds lightly cling to the sky, so gorgeous.

Faint morning shadows gradually painted the surroundings of the earth, showing the contours of mountains and rivers, and the shallow grass by the stone was gently stroked. On the southwest corner of Qingliang Mountain, hundreds of people, like little birds, began to become active. These were the printing workers of the border region printing factory learning the scenes of field warfare. They moved nervously, busy advancing, stabbing, ambushing, and encircling, as if stubborn enemies were waiting for them in front.

Their shadows swept over this hilltop, and then over that hilltop. Then, they heard the sound of majestic singing, which meant they had completed this lesson. Everyone wiped the sweat hanging on their faces with a handkerchief, and with relaxed smiles, they happily stepped back to the foot of the mountain. Looking at the eastern corner, the sunlight had unknowingly revealed its entire face, taking care of their return route so clearly and refreshingly.

As the sunlight gently climbed into the cracks of the windows, the clang of the machines began to rise from the Great Buddha Hall, carrying the clamor of labor. This group of warriors had stored up the enthusiastic emotions and unrestrained postures they had at dawn, and turned into such composure, as if they were sucked in by the lead type trays and machine parts, using their thick hands to deftly grab bright star-like letters and fold piles of printed materials like snowflakes—here it was "Selected Works of Lenin," there it was "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union," and also "Liberation Daily," and "New China Daily," which were sent in large batches to the binding room by several logistics comrades; in that binding room, a dozen female workers were toiling away; because there were no new-style binding machines here, they mostly used their two small hands to replace them, doing "trimming," "punching," and "tieing wires" to complete the appearance of these books and newspapers.

The noisy sound turned to the wasteland at the foot of the mountain, where the sunlight was striking at a right angle. Like a group of construction workers building a road, they were scattered into several small piles, each pile surrounded by one or two cans of green vegetables and bean sprouts, standing and hurriedly eating their lunch. They chewed happily, laughing and joking... After the meal, they rested. The pause was right here, and then playing ball began—"basketball" and "football."

The ball was rolling, leaping, and their hearts were even more lively, clashing with each other like fierce tigers out of a cage. The ball was as round as the scorching sun, so tenacious. They just kept pushing and playing with it. They sweated, chasing non-stop, having fun, feeling fully happy, and then smiling at each other.

The sunlight was like drilling into a bottomless deep hole, going from bright to dim, and then to hazy, and the surroundings of Yan'an were so immersed in deepness.

If there were a borrowed light object in the sky tonight, you could see their shadows in groups of three or five on the diameter of entering Wanfo Temple. If the sky happened to have nothing at all, that would of course make you feel very mysterious, right? If you have a curious heart, you might as well go grope around on that road and give your feet a step-by-step climb. (Note 1) When you slowly grope to the end, you will see a dim light accompanying them sitting in a circle, quietly listening to one person "speaking."

The pattern is somewhat like the storytelling place in the southern village, the speaker is so vivid and the listeners are so absorbed, but there is no sound of chewing melon seeds here, and no aroma of cigarettes. Yes, if you get closer, you can faintly see them still constantly drawing quickly on the paper with pencils.

They were having class! This is everything in their twenty-four hours, in addition to practicing field warfare in the morning and working during the day, there is also such a course in the evening——"United Front Course".

Note 1: The road there is built
gradually rising in the hillside

### A Little Song

— Xu Ye

The Sound of the Qin

In the dead of night, where does the poignant sound of the ancient Greek qin come from?

Not only do my ears hear the sound of the qin, but just mentioning the name of the qin gives me an inexplicable feeling.

This feeling gnaws deeply at my heart, and I will never forget it. For the qin, for my beloved qin, I have been longing for it during the long days.

The qin came from Singapore. A friend brought it back to the motherland from Malaysia. This friend was a singer who had studied Western music for many years.

He liked to sing Beethoven's songs, the Russian Boatmen's Song, and he happily howled the famous songs of ancient Rome. Moreover, in Southeast Asia, he learned the March of the Volunteers.

The memory is exactly the autumn night scene, with a bright moon and shooting stars. He walked alone by the small river.

Singing a powerful song from his throat, the qin moved in his fingers, attracting a group of children who liked this music they had never heard before.

"Can you sing? Follow me, the first sentence is Rise..."

"Rise, rise..."

Soon, the children sang, following the sound of his qin, forming a team, and in the dusk, this sound was like thunder, like a tsunami, as if the wind had swept over the calm lake, suddenly causing countless waves, surging and rushing.

"Sing the Boatmen's Song, no, the Marseillaise!"

"Oh! It's always best to have our March of the Volunteers come to a conclusion!"

In this way, I sang, and kept singing through many days and nights.

In October, our singer disappeared. He left me only this violin from Malaysia.

I cherished the qin and hid it away. He told me to go to Yunnan and Sichuan. I know he is now healthy in the ancient city of Yan'an.

But what about the qin? Is it resting peacefully on my bookshelf in my hometown? Is it covered with a thick layer of dust? Are the strings and bow perhaps being eroded by bookworms? But, who can tell the whereabouts of that violin under the smoke of cannons and bullets? What is hoped for is the battle of the qin, that it will not become the instrument of shameless people, but will be the ready-made horn of the masses, and in the hands of warriors, it will roar out the march and the Marseillaise!

The ancient Greek-style sound of the qin in the late night gradually became quiet, and I carefully looked at the crescent moon pinned on the clouds, suddenly longing for the lost violin.

Let the qin I lost be lost

"Each has its own characteristics"

### Two Miscellaneous Thoughts

— Lan Wen

Cross

One cross connected to another, but my thoughts stretch left and right to infinity.

Are these the days bought with bones? That resolute loyalty, that passionate dedication, should always be an encouragement and a greeting, right?

The era has cast the cross for the residents of this ancient land. For the sake of survival, we all have to carry it, right?

You and I must all be martyrs.

The Weather is Cold

The west wind blows down the paulownia leaves, and also sways my emotions, the weather is cold!

We live in such a city, and colorful pieces of paper have confused people's minds. Conscience is already a superfluous noun.

Raising my head, I saw a beautiful bird in a cage on a branch—I can't say its correct name. Its chirping calls are singing the fulfillment and comfort of life, right?

Poor thing, don't you dislike the smallness of the world in the cage? Don't you have the melancholy of not being able to fly?

Bird? Human? Look up and look around! Our place is also a world of barbed wire!

However, outside the barbed wire, people who are unwilling to live in slavery are doing solemn and great work. For the sake of freedom, they shed blood.

The weather is cold! I remembered the warrior's clothes. What should I do?

### Coming Goose

— Yang Di

Is a green grass in the desert,

temporarily breathing from suffocation,

inspiring the natural thoughts of loving beauty,

to rush to the boundless wilderness.

Like lightning in the darkness,

even if it's just for a moment,

I also saw the sky and the earth groping forward, relying on memory.

A white pigeon flew from afar,

giving me a heartfelt excitement,

"Can you let me get on your back,
and take me back to the source of light?"

### A Great Contribution to the Film Industry—"Explanatory Headphones" Will Be Available at Grand Cathay

— Shu Xiaochun

Chinese people love to watch foreign films, but those who do not have a deep understanding of foreign languages often cannot grasp the subtleties of the plot, and can only observe the actions and expressions of the actors. Therefore, when the characters in the film make humorous and lighthearted remarks, the Westerners in the audience laugh heartily, while the Chinese who do not understand foreign languages are dumbfounded and do not know what they are saying. This is truly a flaw. Therefore, good films with intricate plots and many dialogues often do not sell as well as ordinary films with mediocre plots and more action, perhaps for this reason. In order to remedy this regret, film companies often add Chinese subtitles to the films, but the procedure is troublesome and must be shipped to Japan for printing, as China currently does not have such equipment. On the theater side, some theaters project explanatory slides next to the screen, but these are often brief, and whether subtitles are added to the film or explanatory slides are projected, the audience feels that they have to choose between one or the other. Recently, I heard that the Grand Cathay Theater, in order to thoroughly improve this point, has spent a lot of money to install the latest type of "explanatory headphones" first. If time permits, I heard that they plan to start supplying them in the short term.

The so-called "explanatory headphones" are similar to wireless radio headsets that are worn on the head. When using them, simply insert the wire into the "plug" next to the seat, put them on your ears, and you can hear the Mandarin explanation and dialogue, in detail and clearly, without obstructing the vision of your eyes. When listening to songs, simply take off the headphones, and the original sound of the film can still be heard, as the film is always playing sound. As for the Mandarin explanation in the "explanatory headphones," the theater will translate and broadcast it at any time according to the plot. Audience members who can understand foreign languages can choose not to use these headphones, and there is no extraneous noise to disturb their hearing. Therefore, this equipment has only advantages and no disadvantages, and it is truly a great contribution. I am writing this in advance to record it.

### Recent Hong Kong Film News

— Cui Ping

Hu Die and Chen Yuanyuan. The subject matter of Hu Die's new work was initially said to be "Yang Guifei," then "Philippine Islands Blood Case," and later there was talk of filming the story of Chen Yuanyuan. Now I hear that because ancient costume films are easier to collect box office revenue in the current film market, it has been decided to film Chen Yuanyuan first. The script has already been written and renamed "Peerless Beauty." This film will still adopt the "Rouge Tears" method, filming both Mandarin and Cantonese sound versions. Xinhua Company is cooperating with South Yue Company here, directed by Wang Juelong, starring Wang Naidong, Tang Huaiqiu, Peng Fei, and others.

China's Mount Tai Completed. The film "China's Mount Tai" (renamed from "Adventures on Mount Tai"), which was produced by Xinhua Company in Hong Kong, directed by Wang Juelong, and starring strongman Peng Fei, Li Zhuozhuo, Wang Naidong, Bai Yin, and others, has been completed. This film largely takes the famous natural scenic areas of Hong Kong as its background. The towering mountains, deep rivers, and vast marshes create a majestic atmosphere. Among them, one of the giant trees where the Mount Tai people nest is four people cannot fully encircle the tree trunk. The tree is named Banyan and is over a thousand years old. The branches and roots are interconnected, as if they were artificially connected and supported. The dense shade covers an area of about one acre (it is said that if the tree were felled for timber, it could be sold for more than 10,000 Hong Kong dollars). The Mount Tai film is greatly enhanced by this. Peng Fei, who plays Mount Tai, is re-entering the film world. At the beginning of the establishment of Yihua Company many years ago, Peng starred in "Flames" and "National Survival." This time, playing China's Mount Tai, his strong physique is on par with the Western Mount Tai, Weissmuller, and his skills in somersaulting and jumping are also particularly outstanding. Wang Naidong, Li Zhuozhuo, and others also have unique performances, and the director's use of skills is also unique. I heard that they will continue to film in succession in the future.

Lu Cuilan Marries the Cowherd. Lu Cuilan is starring in a costume film based on the folk tale "Cowherd and Weaver Girl," adapted by Xia Yan, in Hong Kong, co-starring Tang Huaiqiu and members of the China Travel Drama Troupe. It has recently been completed. It was originally scheduled to be released during the Mid-Autumn Festival, but because it could not be completed within the scheduled time, it has now been changed to be screened on Double Ten Day. I heard that this film has a strong sense of the times. It was initially named "Flower of the Earth," but it has now been renamed "New Milky Way Match."

### Talking About Wu Suqiu's Lantern Festival Riddle

— Mei Yi

"Lantern Festival Riddle" is one of the unique famous plays of Xun Ruisheng of Xiaoliuxiang Pavilion. Its popularity in Tianjin is as great as Mei Wan Hua's "Phoenix Returns to the Nest," Cheng Yu Shuang's "Wild Mountain Tears," and Shang Xiao Yun's "Lady of the Lantern Festival." When Wu Suqiu entered Xun's school, Liuxiang immediately presented the "Lantern Festival Riddle" script as a gift. He told her: "This script is one of Mr. Chen Moxu's masterpieces. The complexity of the singing and acting, and the beauty of the plot, can be compared with "Hairpin Head Phoenix" and will be passed down immortally. I give it to you now. I hope you will cherish it forever. If you perform it in Shanghai in the future, you will definitely return with honor." Suqiu respectfully thanked him. I heard that Wu Ling plans to use this play as a breakthrough, but because the arrangement takes time, it has not been possible to fulfill her wish. After a week of rehearsal, all the supporting roles in the play are skilled. In the shortest time (approximately this Friday), it can begin its public performance. The plot of this play is sometimes tragic and sometimes happy, bringing the ability of extremely sad emotion and stubborn beauty to the fullest. The following is a summary of its outline:

Lü Zhaohua is the daughter of Gang Zhong, the Minister of Rites. Her name is Guo Shengtianzhang. Before she was married, Tianzhang's father died. The Guo family was very poor. Gang Zhong was afraid that Tianzhang would lose his education, so he housed him at his home. During the Lantern Festival, Gang Zhong went out at night and returned to Tianzhang's place, where he saw a man and a woman sleeping on the same pillow, resembling Zhaohua and Tianzhang. He was shocked and angry, but considering the reputation of his family, he restrained himself and turned away. The next day, he rebuked Tianzhang. Tianzhang was not humbled, so Gang Zhong was furious and drove Tianzhang away, and blamed his wife, Zhao, and forced Zhaohua to die. At that time, an imperial envoy came to summon Gang Zhong by order of the emperor. Zhaohua still wanted to commit suicide, but Lady Zhao could not stop her, and her uncle, Zhao Banhou, arrived just in time. Banhou had previously stationed troops on the border as a general and entrusted his daughter, Xiuying, to Lady Zhao. At that time, he was going to take up the post of Admiral of Guangdong and was coming to pick up his daughter. At this point, he left Xiuying to serve Lady Zhao and took Zhaohua with him, reporting her death to Gang Zhong. Tianzhang, when he was driven away, was very angry and sent a letter to break off the engagement. However, Banhou saw it and, fearing that he would seriously hurt Zhaohua's heart, secretly kept his letter and calmly chose a marriage for Zhaohua. After a while, a new school commissioner, Zhang Lingge, came, a young man who had passed the imperial examination and was unmarried. Banhou then betrothed Zhaohua to him, and an agreement was reached, but Zhaohua refused. She became ill from sorrow, and Banhou went to Guangdong to invite Lady Zhao to comfort Zhaohua. While traveling, she saw Zhang Lingge, who was her former husband, Guo Tianzhang, and she had no objections. Tianzhang changed his name and passed the imperial examination because Gang Zhong was in charge of the civil service examinations. When they were about to get married, Gang Zhong also returned from Guangdong after being sent to Ryukyu. Banhou invited him to attend the wedding, and the father, daughter, and son-in-law met in the same hall, and then they were able to explain the previous misunderstandings.

### Unofficial Anecdotes from the Pear Garden (Opera World)

— Xu Muyun

Actors and Opium

Qingkui and Shuyan both had smoky voices, but their methods of using them were quite different. Qingkui liked to exert himself vigorously when performing on stage, using all his strength, to the point that later he would run out of breath and his voice would get softer and softer. When he was recording "Crying at the Qin Court" for Victory Records, one *daoban* (a type of aria) took up more than a minute. The engineer was not very satisfied, saying that each record cost a thousand dollars, with only three minutes per side, and the company spent five hundred dollars to buy only two lines of singing, which seemed too unworthy. As for the other one, his voice was close to Liu Bo's style. If he could specialize in learning Hongsheng's (a particular style of Peking Opera), and not also sing Sun Pai's (another style) "Xiaoyao Jin" with forced effort, his voice would definitely not have deteriorated so quickly. Whenever Shuyan performed on stage, his voice was extremely low and soft, sometimes even with a hoarse sound, but afterwards it would become brighter and brighter, clear and full, without showing any strain at all. This showed the value of a "skillful voice." At the same time, Shuyan's ability to use his voice was unmatched by others.

Later, I heard people say that Qingkui had returned to smoking opium, but his voice still had not recovered. From this, it can be seen that the relationship between opium and an actor's voice is even closer and more important. As for why his vocal cords suddenly became hoarse and unable to produce sound after he quit smoking opium, we still need to ask experts in medicine to study it carefully.

I have a classmate, a doctor with the surname Wu, who studied medicine in Germany and specialized in pulmonary tuberculosis. According to him, many famous German doctors admit that it is beneficial for people with lung disease to smoke opium. The reason is that opium has astringent properties. It cannot be said that it can cure lung disease, but it can maintain the original state and prevent people with lung disease from progressing from the first stage to the second or third stage. Furthermore, the thing that people with lung disease fear the most is coughing too severely, which can damage the heart and lungs, and wouldn't the condition worsen day by day? Since opium has the effect of stopping coughs and relieving asthma, it is not only beneficial to people suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, but also allows actors to avoid coughing and asthma when performing on stage, preventing them from hindering their singing and modulating their voice.

"Four Feathers"

"The Four Feathers" is a production of the British Alexander Korda Company. It consistently promotes the glorious achievements of the British army in conquering the natives of Africa. However, it encourages the public to bravely stand on the front lines and serve the motherland. From our perspective "here and now," the story of "The Four Feathers" is also worth promoting.

The story is as follows: On the eve of the British North Surrey Regiment's departure for Egypt, Harry suddenly requests to resign. His colleagues Willoughby, Burroughs, Durrance, etc., mock him for his cowardice and retreating at the last moment, and each present him with a white feather. To clear his name, Harry decides to go to Egypt alone: to rescue his three friends and help the British army defeat the natives.

The production of "The Four Feathers" is like "The Drum Beats." The director devoted all his efforts to several large-scale war scenes, such as: (1) When the British commander-in-chief ordered Burroughs, Willoughby, and Durrance to lead a small number of British troops to lure the natives, the natives besieged them, the British army resisted, cavalry galloped, rockets shot everywhere, and the British army was eventually captured due to being outnumbered; and (2) Harry secretly handed a steel file to Burroughs and conspired to escape. At that time, the British army happened to attack in large numbers, so they cooperated from the inside and the outside to defeat the natives. The tight editing and the grandeur of the scenes in these two scenes all show the director's outstanding skills. The scene where Harry rescues Durrance is even more moving. For example: After Harry wakes up, he helps Durrance back to the camp; Durrance intends to kill himself with a gun, Harry takes away the gun and supports him with a cane; they search for water on the desolate sandy land; by the river, he plunges into the water. Here, the director uses the black shadows of the hawks flying in the sky to set off the danger of the two living people on the ground, and uses various difficult and arduous scenes to strengthen their sincere friendship. This exquisite and meticulous technique is more lovely than his handling of large scenes. Other scenes, such as Harry dressing up as a native and using singing and whip sounds when pulling the boat along the river, and ten years ago, when Harry fell asleep, he held a candle, and the candlelight reflected on heroic photos, are also exquisite and lovely.

Ralph Richardson, who plays Durrance, is the best actor. After his eyes were damaged by the poisonous sunlight, his acting became very serious. John Clements (Harry) is also calm and powerful.
