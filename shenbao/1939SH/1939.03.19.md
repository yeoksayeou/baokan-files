Editorial

### On the Recent War Situation

In the past two or three weeks, the situation on the European continent has been extremely tense, and the situation in the Shanghai concessions has been very serious. At the same time, the fighting in various parts of China has also been intense for a while, but has now eased down. This ebb and flow of the situation illustrates that although the Japanese military in China will not collapse immediately, it has already reached the end of its strength. At the same time, it also confirms the correctness of the theory of China's protracted war of resistance. In fact, the Chinese military already has a considerable grasp of victory. However, this ebb and flow situation will continue to occur frequently in the future, and China's heroic fighters must continue to endure great sacrifices in order to drive the enemy away step by step until the complete restoration of the country.

The recent war can be divided into several aspects: In the Hubei area, the Japanese army attempted to seize Xiangfan. If Xiangfan were captured, not only could Wuhan be consolidated, but also Yunyang could be approached to the north, Guanzhong could be viewed in the northwest, and Jingyi could be pointed to the south, controlling the key roads into Sichuan and the upper reaches of Dongting Lake. However, the Japanese army attacking Xiangfan was stranded in Zhongxiang, confined to the east bank of the Xiang River, and has become a defensive position. Another route in the Xihe area encountered strong resistance, with casualties reaching more than 30,000, and currently cannot take any action, so the attempt in this area has obviously stalled. In the Shanxi area, the Japanese army used the railway line of Taiyuan, Linfen, Xinxing and other places as a base, attempting to advance westward across the river in two routes, north and south, to capture the northwest. However, repeated attacks were frustrated, and the rear flanks were severely attacked by the heroic guerrilla troops, with heavy casualties, resulting in a retreat to the original location without any progress. In the northern Jiangsu area, the Japanese army attempted to open up the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, attacking Huaiyin by land and sea from Tongshan and Lianyungang. Although Huaiyin has fallen, the Japanese army in Yangzhou in the south was blocked at Zhaoguanba, and the Japanese army in Nantong was wandering around Rugao and Taixian, unable to establish contact to the north, and recently there has been news of the recapture of Siyang and Lianshui, then the Japanese army in Huaiyin is simply isolated and the attempt to control northern Jiangsu is very difficult to succeed. In the Guangdong area, although Hainan Island is in a special situation, the Japanese army has never been able to penetrate inland; as for the Yuejiang River basin, although the Japanese army is frequently dispatched, the role is only to defend against the counteroffensive of the Chinese army, and there is no positive significance. In addition, in the northern Jiangxi area, the Japanese army has attempted to bypass the east of Poyang Lake to attack Nanchang, but the Chinese army's preparations have been very sufficient, and the war has not made much progress in recent days. In the eastern Zhejiang area, although the Japanese navy has repeatedly declared that it will attack Linhai, the purpose is only to contain the Chinese army's forces to counterattack Hangzhou, so there is no fact of the attack at all, but only a bluff.

In the recent war situation in various places, several characteristics can be clearly found: First, the Japanese army can no longer coordinate in all directions like before, and jointly attack a certain point, but only launch local attacks in various places. And the targets of the launch are also very inconsistent, rather than actively preparing for a new offensive, it is better to say that it is a passive defense of the military strongholds that have been obtained, which is enough to prove that the Japanese army has turned from an active to a passive stage. Second, the various parts of the Japanese army have lost their coordination. For example, when the Japanese army in central Hubei attempted to capture Xiangfan, the Japanese army in eastern Henan did not have any intention of responding to the west; and when the Japanese army in Xuhai attacked Qingjiangpu to the south, the Japanese army in Tongyang did not actively coordinate. Here, it can be seen that either the Japanese army's own orders cannot be unified, or their deployment has already revealed embarrassment. Third, China's guerrilla warfare has gradually produced positive effects. For example, when the Japanese army in Wuhan attacked north, the guerrilla warfare in eastern and southern Hubei was greatly launched, containing the Japanese army's advance, and as soon as Huaiyin in northern Jiangsu was lost, guerrilla troops were immediately deployed on the east and west sides of the Grand Canal, making the Japanese army fall into isolation. In addition, guerrilla warfare is widely developing in various places in southern Shandong, eastern Shandong, western Zhejiang, and southern Hebei, containing a lot of the Japanese army's forces and making them exhausted to deal with it; as for the control of the situation in northern China by the guerrilla forces in the highlands of Shanxi, preventing the Japanese army's attempt to invade the west, it has been more than a year ago, and now it is becoming more and more effective, and there is even the possibility of completely annihilating the Japanese army. Fourth, the combat effectiveness of the Chinese army has been gradually strengthened. In the decisive battle of Zhongxiang, the number of casualties of the Chinese and Japanese armies has become a one-to-one ratio. Summarizing the above points, we can see that judging from the military situation alone, China's war of resistance has turned into a favorable stage. What's more, in addition to the military, there are various aspects such as diplomacy and economy, and the rise and fall between China and Japan are all in the key to transformation!

China is currently grasping this favorable situation of military, diplomatic, and economic coordination, and in the near future, it will launch a large-scale counteroffensive scene. Heroic fighters, should rejoice for the expected great victory!

### Assassin of Fan Shisheng Surrenders

The Assassin is the Son of Deceased Officer Zhen; Yang Weiqian Confesses that He Took Revenge for His Father

(Kunming) In the case of the assassination of Fan Shisheng, it is reported that the assassin has surrendered himself to the police station and issued a confession of revenge for his father. The police station has now transferred the assassin to the court for trial. Fan's body was moved to his private residence for encoffining on the evening of the 17th. His family has telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Chairman Long Yun, reporting the circumstances of Fan's assassination and requesting that the assassin be punished according to law. Fan was 53 years old, graduated from the special class of the Yunnan Suoying School, and served as the captain of the 1st Battalion of the Northern Expeditionary Army Artillery, director of the Yunnan Kaiwu General Office Advisory Office, commander of the 16th Infantry Regiment of the Army, commander of the 2nd Army of the Yunnan Army stationed in Guangdong, commander of the 16th Army of the National Revolutionary Army, commander of the Xiangfan Garrison, and commander of the 51st Division, and member of the National Anti-Smoking Committee. His mother is over eighty years old and still alive, and his wife is currently living in Shanghai, leaving behind two daughters and one son (only four years old). His posthumous affairs are extremely desolate. (17th Telegram)

(Kunming) After the Fan case occurred, the local authorities here paid great attention to it. According to the assassin Yang Weiqian's father, the late officer Yang Zhen, was Fan's classmate and comrade. When Yang was a regimental commander, Fan served as his regimental adjutant. Until the 14th year of the Republic of China, Yang was the front-line commander of Fan's troops stationed in Nanning. Fan and Yang lived in the same room. Yang was assassinated by mutinous soldiers, but Fan survived unscathed. Therefore, Yang's son suspected that his father's death was instigated by Fan. This is the motive for the assassination. According to his confession, it was purely revenge for his father. (17th Telegram)

(Chongqing) Minister of Military and Political Affairs He Yingqin today telegraphed Chairman Long to express his condolences to the family of Lieutenant General Fan Shisheng on his behalf. The original telegram is recorded as follows: To Chairman Long Zhizhou of Kunming, I am grieved to hear the news that Lieutenant General Fan Shisheng, a member of the Military Commission, was assassinated and killed in Yunnan. Fan joined the revolutionary work early in his career and made remarkable achievements. In recent years, he has devoted himself to healing the sick and saving the world, which is particularly commendable. He was killed unexpectedly, and I deeply mourn his loss. Please send someone nearby to express condolences to his family on his behalf. It is heard that the assassin has been apprehended, and I hope that the details of the interrogation will be shown.

### Japanese Troops in Xian County Killed Over a Hundred

(Beiping) The Japanese garrison in Xian County, central Hebei, requested the dispatch of a troupe of prostitutes to "comfort" the soldiers. Japanese in Baoding then hired thirty Chinese prostitutes and twenty Korean prostitutes, guaranteeing their safe return with a deposit. The prostitutes were paid two yuan per day, with meals provided. A Baoding guerrilla spy obtained the information and reported it to the guerrilla headquarters, estimating that the prostitute troupe would arrive in Xian County on a certain day. The guerrillas anticipated that the Japanese garrison would be less vigilant after the arrival of the prostitute troupe, so they attacked Xian County at that time. As a result, one-third of the 300 Japanese soldiers were killed. Some of the prostitutes were killed by the Japanese army, some joined the guerrillas, and others remained in Xian County.

### Japanese Troops in Dongting Lake Harass Changbutai

### Chairman of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce Still Held by Bandits

The Kidnapping of Mr. Otte

Mr. Otte, the 52-year-old Chairman of the Tianjin British Chamber of Commerce, was kidnapped yesterday afternoon from his residence in the former German concession by three Chinese men. He is still in the hands of the bandits. Previous reports that Mr. Otte had escaped were inaccurate, caused by a misreport from a village 12 miles away on the Tianjin-Gugu Highway. The actual situation is that around 3:30 PM yesterday, Japanese sentries in that village saw a car carrying one foreigner and three Chinese men, driven by a Chinese chauffeur. They ordered it to stop, but the chauffeur sped up and raced through the village gate. Major Mayne of the British Army in Tianjin, escorted by 30 Japanese soldiers, went to the village to search for Mr. Otte and learned the details. Initially, it was planned to have British police conduct the search, but at the last minute, the plan was changed, and Major Mayne was assigned the task. The 30 Japanese soldiers accompanying Major Mayne carried two machine guns. According to the Japanese sentries, they were under orders not to fire at vehicles carrying foreigners, so they could not stop the car carrying Mr. Otte. A phone call was immediately made to a village six miles away to inquire about the car's passage, and the Tianjin authorities were informed. The misunderstanding of these phone calls led to the false report of Mr. Otte's escape. When Major Mayne arrived at the village, he questioned the Japanese sentries and police, but could not obtain any further information. He then went with the Japanese guards to the village six miles away, but the villagers said they had not seen a car carrying a foreigner. Major Mayne and his party traveled between the two villages, but in the dim light, it was difficult to determine if the car had driven off the main road, although it was considered difficult, as there were deep ditches on both sides of the road. Major Mayne and his party conducted a search as far as Dazhan, but without any results. No one said they had seen a car pass in the afternoon. Major Mayne returned to Tianjin this morning.

(Tokyo) The government, following the recommendation of the Central Price Committee, has implemented Article 19 of the National Mobilization Law today. According to the provisions of this article, the government controls prices, freight, storage fees, insurance fees, rent, and handling fees. Previously, prices were controlled by orders from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Previously, an order was issued based on the Emergency Ordinance for Controlling Import and Export Trade, and violators could be sentenced to imprisonment for up to 12 months or a fine of up to 1,000 yuan. However, now that Article 19 has been implemented, it automatically involves Article 30 of the National Mobilization Law, according to which the imprisonment will be increased to three years and the fine will be increased to 5,000 yuan.

### Where Is the Good Faith in Breaking Promises? Chamberlain Warns Hitler

The Use of Violence Will Inevitably Backfire. Britain's Policy Toward Germany Turns Tough

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in Birmingham tonight, saying, "The major events currently taking place in Europe have made all other matters secondary. I believe that what you all want to hear is an expression of the British government's views on these disputes. There is no doubt that world opinion is now more shocked than ever by the actions of the German government. What kind of impact this turbulence will have is unpredictable, but I am certain that its future consequences will be far-reaching. On Wednesday, due to insufficient information, I had to make cautious and restrained remarks on what I considered at the time to be an inconvenient situation to criticize, and my words were slightly calm and objective, leading to misunderstandings that I was not very moved by this event. This is actually wrong, and I want to correct it tonight."

### First, Defending the Policy of Appeasement

Critics say that the occupation of Czechoslovakia was a direct consequence of my trip to Germany last autumn, and that the result of recent events, the tearing up of the Munich Agreement, proves that my trip to Germany was a complete failure. It is further said that this is the Prime Minister's personal policy, so the Prime Minister must bear the responsibility for the fate of Czechoslovakia. The above conclusions are completely unfounded. My trip to Germany, its first main reason, was that the situation at that time was extremely dangerous, and the only opportunity to save the European war seemed to be here. The first objective of my trip to Germany was finally achieved, and European peace was preserved. Without this trip, I don’t know how many hundreds of thousands of families in Europe would be crying today. Of course, I don’t need to defend my trip to Germany. If it hadn’t happened that day, I ask, what would the situation be like? What Britain, France, and Russia could have done may not have been able to protect Czechoslovakia from aggression and destruction. From our sending troops to fight Germany, and finally winning victory after terrible losses, we would never have created Czechoslovakia as stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles. I went to Munich to promote the so-called European appeasement policy. For this policy to succeed, the great powers must abandon their ambition to dominate Europe, and focus on seeking reasonable conveniences, so as to develop their own interests, consolidate their own international trade, and improve the conditions of their own people."

### Germany's Solemn Promises Are Still in My Ears

At that time, Hitler made a promise in Munich, stating that his territorial ambition in Europe would not extend beyond the Sudetenland. Hitler also reiterated this in Berlin. I feel that this repeatedly stated guarantee can be hoped to solve the Czech problem from now on, because the situation in Munich that day seemed to be able to proceed with the appeasement policy. However, I will not prepare to relax my vigilance until the appeasement policy has been established and accepted by other countries. Therefore, after the Munich Conference, our national defense program was actually carried out and expanded, in order to remedy certain weaknesses found in the crisis. I firmly know that after the Munich Conference, most of the people in the United Kingdom shared the same hope as me, and were eager for the appeasement policy to proceed without stagnation, but today this hope has been completely shattered, and this is what I and most of my compatriots are disappointed and indignant about. How can the recent events be reconciled with the guarantees I just mentioned? I am one of the signatories of the Munich Agreement. If Hitler thought that he should cancel the previous one, he should have consulted me in accordance with the Munich Declaration, but he didn't do this. Hitler acted arbitrarily.

### The Czech People Were Actually Poisoned

When the Czech President had not yet received the German demands that he could not refuse, the German army had already set out on the way and entered the Czech capital in a few hours, forcibly making Czechoslovakia its vassal state. Then, the brave Czech people were suddenly poisoned, their freedom was cut, and their independence was dead. How can we not sympathize with them? Where is the so-called no more territorial ambitions now? Where is the so-called never absorbing the Czech people into Germany now? Where is the principle of self-determination that Hitler strongly argued to me when he advocated the separation of the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia in Berchtesgaden? Such solemn guarantees, repeatedly stated, were ignored. If a good reason can still be easily found to cover up its wrongdoings, then any other guarantee from the same party, how can the question of how to trust it not arise? The events of this week were caused by the German government's complete disregard for its own principles.

### The Starting Point of a New Adventurous Attempt

We cannot help but ask ourselves, is this the end of the old adventurous attempts, or the beginning of new adventurous attempts? Is this the last blow to the weaker countries, or will there be successors? Is this a step in an attempt to dominate the world by force? These are serious and urgent questions. Please forgive me for not answering them tonight. However, I am certain that not only Germany's neighbors, but also other countries that are farther away, even countries far beyond Europe, will give serious and urgent consideration to these questions. Judging from the existing scene, this trend has already begun and will obviously progress rapidly.

### Taking the Maintenance of Freedom as a Vocation

As far as we ourselves are concerned, we must of course first pay attention to the various parts within the British Empire, and definitely to France, which has close relations with Britain. We must now review the situation with the practical responsibility required by the seriousness of the situation. All matters related to national security must be included in the review. We must look at the points on which our national life depends from the standpoint of national security. For the sake of peace, nothing cannot be sacrificed, but there is one thing that cannot be sacrificed, that is, the freedom that we have enjoyed for thousands of years, and we will never give it up. I am certainly not prepared to subject our country to new and unlimited restraints, but if outsiders say that our country is not prepared to participate in actions to resist challenges with all its strength, then their mistake is nothing more than this. When I say this, I am sure that I have not only obtained the support, sympathy, and trust of all the people in our country, but also the approval of the entire British Empire and other countries in the world that love peace, but love freedom even more. After the audience heard Chamberlain's last paragraph, applause and cheers continued incessantly. The audience then thanked the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister replied, "We do not need to be saddened. Britain is a powerful country, even stronger than it was six months ago. All acts of violence and injustice will be repaid sooner or later. Every act of aggression by Germany has brought new dangers to Germany's future. I dare to predict that Germany will deeply hate what its government is doing now." (Reuter, 17th)

### Positive Reviews from the United States and France

(Washington) The speech delivered by the British Prime Minister in Birmingham yesterday has been praised by political figures here, who all say that Britain's attitude has changed and that it is no longer compromising with Germany. In other words, Chamberlain has frankly admitted that the "appeasement policy" previously pursued was indeed a mistake, and has expressed his willingness to follow President Roosevelt and present himself as a defender of democracy and freedom, which is gratifying. As for American public opinion, there were originally those who supported the appeasement policy and those who supported President Roosevelt's policy, but now that the British policy has changed, there will inevitably be a significant impact on American public opinion. In addition, there is one more thing to mention, that is, when Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered his speech last night, most of the important figures in the United States listened remotely via radio, and deeply felt that his tone revealed his being fooled by Hitler. (Havas, 17th)

(Paris) The French newspapers generally believe that the importance of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham yesterday must be judged by focusing more on Chamberlain's well-known conservative nature than on the rather serious words used in the speech. Le Petit Journal said that Chamberlain had previously made remarks that Germany would deeply regret the actions of its government. Chamberlain's making this statement is because he deeply knows that he must treat force with force, and all reconciliation efforts are considered cowardly. (Reuter, 18th)

### Impressions of Germany and Italy

(Berlin) The newspapers here have not yet carried a single word of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech. A spokesman for the officialdom told a Reuters reporter that German officials did not have time to thoroughly study it, but another spokesman for the political circles said that in terms of the situation, Chamberlain's speech was extremely radical and unfair. Chamberlain's attitude is probably due to the influence of Roosevelt's remarks. The extent to which Britain and France welcome this kind of discussion has made a deep impression in Germany. (Reuter, 18th)

(Rome) After the British Prime Minister delivered a speech in Birmingham yesterday, severely criticizing Hitler, people from all walks of life here, although seemingly not paying much attention to it, were actually unable to remain unmoved. Diplomatic figures said that this speech is of great significance, and the future impact is incalculable. What is noteworthy is that the United States has already reacted, and the current neutrality law in that country will be amended in the short term. (Havas, 18th)

### Romania Is Relieved

(Rome) It is heard here that the speech delivered by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in Birmingham yesterday was greatly relieved, because Chamberlain stated that Britain will not give up its interests in southeastern Europe. (Reuter, 18th)

### Britain and France Recall Their Ambassadors to Germany

(Berlin) British Ambassador to Germany Henderson has been recalled home to report on the situation in Central Europe and is scheduled to leave for home today. (Haitong Telegraph, 18th)

(Paris) Responsible officials here recently announced that the government has telegraphed Ambassador to Germany Coulondre to return home on the morning of the 20th of this month to report on his duties. (Havas News Agency, 18th)

(Paris) Some newspapers here expect that the French government will visit the British government's actions and recall its ambassador to Germany to report on his duties. Everyone feels that although this move does not sever diplomatic relations, it is a good way to express dissatisfaction with the act of breaking promises. (Reuter, 18th)

### British Cabinet Meeting

(London) After holding a temporary meeting today, Prime Minister Chamberlain invited the High Commissioners of the various autonomous territories stationed in the United Kingdom to discuss the international situation. (Havas, 18th)

(London) US Ambassador Kennedy visited the British Foreign Office at 12:30 noon today to hold talks. It is generally believed that the talks must be related to the Central European situation. (Havas Telegraph, 18th)

### Britain and France Protest to Germany

Do Not Recognize the New Situation in Central Europe

(London) British Ambassador to Germany Henderson has been ordered to declare to the German government that Britain believes that the recent events are completely in conflict with the Munich Agreement, and that the changes caused by German military actions have no legal basis. (Reuter, 18th)

(Paris) The French Ambassador to Germany has been ordered to inform the German government that France does not recognize Germany's intervention in Czechoslovakia as legal. (Reuter, 18th)

### Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union Join Hands in Governing the Country

There is a Possibility of Forming an Anti-Dictatorial Front. Frequent Diplomatic Contacts in London

(London) At 5 PM today, the British Cabinet convened a special meeting. It is heard that the British Cabinet will consider protesting against Germany's violation of the Munich Agreement. If the Cabinet passes the protest to Germany, it must be postponed for the time being, because the British side is currently waiting for Hitler to issue a reply to Chamberlain's speech. It is rumored that Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union will form a common front against totalitarian countries. Judging from Italy's serious attitude towards Germany's invasion of Czechoslovakia, this move is not impossible. (Associated Press, 18th)

(London) Political figures here recently declared that the representatives of the governments of Britain, France, the United States, and the Soviet Union are conducting talks in London. Although this has not been confirmed so far, the British authorities are indeed planning to invite Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Litvinov to London. In addition, political figures also commented on the speech delivered by Prime Minister Chamberlain in Birmingham yesterday, believing that the Prime Minister has fully recognized the lessons learned in this decisive incident, and therefore should replace the "idealistic policy" with a "realistic policy." (Havas Telegraph, 18th)

(London) Foreign Minister Halifax met with French Ambassador Corbin, US Ambassador Kennedy, Soviet Ambassador Maisky, and German Ambassador Dirkson this morning, and instructed Ambassador to Germany Henderson to make representations to the German government regarding the decisive incident in Czechoslovakia, stating that the actions taken by Germany are in conflict with the Munich Agreement. (Havas Telegraph, 18th)

### Hitler Returns to Linz

Linz: Leader Hitler arrived in Linz this afternoon and stayed at the Wan Xin Ge Hotel. (Haitong Telegraph, 18th)

(Berlin) Leader Hitler departed from Vienna at 11 AM this morning, but his destination is still unknown. It is expected that he will return to Beijing tomorrow afternoon. Preparations are being made for a grand welcome ceremony. As for the annexation of Czechoslovakia, Leader Hitler is unwilling to express his position until he understands the attitudes of various countries. Therefore, the House of Representatives may not convene a meeting for the time being. (Havas Telegraph, 18th)

Vienna: Leader Hitler, accompanied by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Army General Keitel, Director of Political Affairs of the Prime Minister's Office Lammers, Chief of the Political Police Himmler, and Director of the Foreign Intelligence Office Dietrich, returned to this city from Brno at 5 PM yesterday. (Havas Telegraph, 17th)

Thousands of National Socialist Party members cheered for Hitler along the way to show their welcome. The enthusiasm was even greater than when Hitler came here during the German-Austrian merger last year. Planes circled in the sky, and National Socialist Party youth demonstrated and marched through the streets. (Associated Press, 18th)

### Polish People Demonstrate Against Germany

Warsaw: More than a thousand people here held an anti-German demonstration this afternoon, which was extremely intense, and shouted slogans such as "Down with Hitler" and "Long live democracy." They then wanted to march to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but were dispersed by mounted police, and many were injured. At night, the glass windows of several German stores were smashed, and the police authorities had to send more police officers to patrol the streets to maintain order. (Havas Telegraph, 17th)

### Portugal and Spain Sign a Non-Aggression Treaty

Lisbon: Portugal and Spain signed a Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression between the two countries at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here today. The signatories were Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar and Spanish Ambassador Nicolas Franco. The Spanish Ambassador is the brother of General Franco, the leader of the Spanish National Government. (Reuter, 18th)

### Beneš Urges Democratic Nations

Do Not Recognize Germany's Annexation of Czechoslovakia

Chicago – Former Czechoslovak President Edvard Beneš recently telegraphed President Roosevelt, French Premier Daladier, British Prime Minister Chamberlain, and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, stating that Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia is an international crime and urging them not to recognize it. (Havas, 17th)

(Geneva) The telegram was also copied to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, ending with a note stating, "I deeply believe that no member state of the League of Nations will recognize this crime. I hope that all member states will promptly fulfill the various obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant." Avenol immediately replied, acknowledging receipt of the telegram. (Havas, 18th)

### US Government Issues Declaration Condemning Germany's Actions as Illegal

Peace Can Only Be Maintained Through Respect for International Law and Order; President Roosevelt Believes Neutrality Law Needs Revision

(Washington) US Under Secretary of State Welles, with President Roosevelt's permission, issued a statement yesterday condemning Germany's actions as outrageous and illegal, stating, "The US government has repeatedly stated that it firmly believes that world peace can only be maintained if all countries in the world respect and support world order and the rule of law. The US government cannot but denounce the action of eliminating the freedom of an independent nation by force. The US government's position has long been declared to the world, that is, the US has always emphasized the sanctity of treaties and promises, has always advocated non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and has repeatedly expressed its condemnation of military aggression. Actions that disregard international law and actions of force are actions that endanger world peace and the foundation of culture. The events of the past three months have fully demonstrated the absolute accuracy of the US's claims, that is, world peace must be effective only if all countries can abide by the principles of world peace." (AP, 18th) Simultaneously, President Roosevelt, after Welles issued this statement, also told reporters that the US, due to changes in the European situation, must enact a new neutrality law and indicated that this matter is currently being discussed with congressional leaders and national defense leaders. According to the President's message to Congress on January 4 of this year, the current neutrality law is not applicable because it not only does not help peaceful countries but also helps belligerent countries. According to the President at the time, to curb the rampant flow of aggression, the US has more powerful methods than empty words, apart from using war. The President also stated last night that the US is not prepared to recognize Franco. At the same time, the US Treasury Department also announced the revocation of the preferential terms previously granted to Czechoslovakia. Thereafter, imports of Czech goods will be subject to the same high US tariffs as German goods. As for the Guam port project development case, the President stated that it will be incorporated into the river and sea port project for handling, which shows that the US will still proceed with the defense of Guam to warn aggressive countries in the Far East. (AP, 18th)

Judgmental Tone; Extremely Worth Pondering

(Washington) According to sources here, Under Secretary of State Welles' formal statement today condemning the German government's outrageous and illegal remarks intentionally abandoned polite diplomatic language and used a judgmental tone. According to a spokesperson close to the government, we no longer need to make pitiful justifications for aggression. At the very least, the world can now see our position. Democratic Senator King delivered a speech in the Senate today, stating that Britain and France's attitude towards the robbery of Czechoslovakia was to stand by and watch. He wants the US to sever all relations with all aggressor nations. The news that the British ambassador to Germany has been recalled is very welcome here, saying that although this move is a bit late, it can still connect Britain with President Roosevelt's actions last November. (Havas, 17th)

Righteous Assistance to the Weak

(Washington) Under Secretary of State Welles' formal declaration on the Central European incident stated that Czechoslovakia's freedom was "temporarily extinguished." Responsible persons here recently commented that the US government does not intend to directly or indirectly recognize Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia as a legal act, as can be seen from the word "temporarily." Political figures also said that the government does not intend to recognize the new situation in Central Europe for a long time. The State Department will still recognize Hurban, the Czech ambassador. So far, the German government has neither formally offered an explanation nor stated its intentions. The current tense relationship between the US and Germany will inevitably be intensified by this. People in the State Department recently issued a statement saying that the US government has expressed its indignation at Germany's further act of aggression, so the spiritual strength of the democratic countries in Europe can be reunited. In addition, it is said that the US government intends to fully support the Czech people in restoring independence and has informally encouraged Czech Ambassador Hurban to maintain a stance of resistance. (Havas, 17th)

Czech Loans to the US Subject to Additional Taxes

(Washington) Responsible persons recently declared that after Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, the US government does not intend to directly or indirectly recognize it as a legal act, but when goods from Moravia and Bohemia are imported into the US in the future, they should be required to pay additional taxes, just like goods from mainland Germany. (Havas, 17th)

Czech Embassy in the US

Refuses to Hand Over to Germany

(Washington) Czech Ambassador to the US Hurban recently received instructions from Foreign Minister Chvalkovský to hand over the embassy to the German embassy, but Ambassador Hurban, because President Hácha's surrender to Germany was a violation of the constitution, refused to obey. (Havas, 17th)

### Mirror of National Subjugation: Over 10,000 Czechs Arrested

Prague – According to sources here, since the German army invaded Czechoslovakia, the number of Czechs arrested by the Germans has reached 12,000. The number of Jews and Czech soldiers who have committed suicide in the past three days is very large. Now, wherever the German army has arrived in Bohemia, Moravia, and Slovakia, it has fallen into a state of terror. (AP, 18th)

### German Troops Gather on the Czech-Hungarian Border

Unfathomable Motives Cause Anxiety; Is It a Preparation for the Invasion of Hungary?

Prague – In the past two days, the number of German troops passing through this city has been very large, far exceeding the troops needed to occupy Moravia and Bohemia. Observers here are extremely worried, fearing that Germany will have some major military action. Some even said that if there is further military action, its target will be the Hungarian capital. For two months, Germans in Bratislava have been using "Long Live March 15" as a slogan, and now they have changed to "Long Live April." This slogan may be a signal to advance into the Hungarian capital, or it may not be known. It is said that German troops were once concentrated west of the Hungarian border a few weeks ago. The Hungarian government immediately inquired about the reason, and the German government replied that it was an exercise and immediately withdrew the troops. Although this news has not been confirmed, given the current situation, how can we know that Germany's intention is not on the Hungarian border, assessing the situation and considering it as a future attack step. (Havas, 18th)

Bratislava – It is rumored here that the Slovak government will cede this city to Germany, and Hungary will return Košice (originally belonging to the Slovak province and assigned to Hungary in early November of last year) to this state for compensation. It is heard that Hungarian troops have begun to withdraw from the city. In addition, German troops have occupied most of the important cities of this state, and some have reached the suburbs of this city and are scheduled to enter the city in the evening. (Havas, 17th)

Central European Region

Completely Transformed

Other Countries' Territories Are Violated; Hitler Does As He Pleases

Prague – Today's "Czech Capital Daily" stated that the entire Central European region will be transformed according to the political will of the Führer, and Bohemia is only one part of it. The newspaper also said that the borders near the German center that were in danger have now fallen and explained that the Germans have the right to occupy territories sufficient to accommodate their large population and cultural achievements. (Reuters, 17th)

(Berlin) After the disintegration of Czechoslovakia, the borders of the Moravia and Bohemia protectorates and the Slovak state, the border between the state and the Carpathian Ukraine province, have not yet been formally delineated. It is heard that Germany has decided to order the protectorates to incorporate some areas into German territory and for the Slovak state to cede some areas as compensation. At the same time, some areas will be ceded from the Carpathian Ukraine province to compensate the Slovak state. (Havas, 17th)

Czech Parties Merge into One

(Berlin) Führer Hitler has instructed Czech Fascist leader General Gajda to merge the Czech parties into one according to totalitarian principles, with Czech President Hácha as the leader. Various institutions and organizations, such as the Bar Association and the General Federation of Trade Unions, have begun to exclude Jews.

In addition, according to news from Prague, former Czech Defense Minister General Syrový is still residing there and met with Führer Büttler yesterday. Rumors that he has fled to the UK are not accurate. (Havas, 17th)

Slovak People Anxious

Břeclav – The Slovak people are all anxious about the future status of the state. People are buying large quantities of leather, textiles, and other goods, implying distrust of the Czech currency. Banks have been temporarily closed for three days. Although it has been decided to reopen today, withdrawals are restricted. All traffic in the country will be changed to driving on the left side of the road from today. (Haitong, 18th)

Japan Cheers

Congratulates Germany on the Success of the Invasion of Czechoslovakia

(Berlin) Ambassador Oshima telegraphed the German Foreign Minister (currently in Vienna), expressing congratulations on the annexation of Czechoslovakia, stating, "Your government has recently achieved unprecedented victory. I am now ordered by my Foreign Minister to extend my congratulations on behalf of my country. Your Führer Hitler's courageous decision is unparalleled and greatly beneficial to the pacification of the European situation and the establishment of world peace. Please convey this intention to your government." (Havas, 17th)

### Germany Appoints Neurath as Governor of the Bohemian-Moravian Protectorate

(Berlin) Hitler has appointed Privy Councilor and former Foreign Minister Neurath as the German Governor of Bohemia and Moravia. (Havas, 18th)

(Berlin) It is widely believed that former Czech President Hácha will be appointed President of the new protectorate, and General Gajda, the so-called "Czech Führer," will be appointed Prime Minister. (Reuters, 18th)

Italy

Feels Depressed

(Rome) Although Italian government officials have expressed joy after Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, considering the overall situation, the Italian side also feels depressed. When Germany and Austria merged, there were signs of anxiety here. Now, Germany did not consult the Italian government and directly placed the fait accompli of the annexation of Czechoslovakia before Italy. Therefore, it is conceivable that Italy, in the midst of forced smiles, inevitably feels a hidden pain in its heart. People generally say that Germany's actions are not aboveboard, so trust in Germany has naturally decreased sharply. Moreover, watching Germany's territory expand day by day and becoming the dominant force, Italy's future has also been threatened by its de facto threat. Moreover, Italy has repeatedly been disappointed in Central and Southeastern Europe, so it plans to develop elsewhere and seek compensation in the Mediterranean and Africa. However, the difficulties Italy will encounter in the Mediterranean are greater than the obstacles Germany encountered when expanding into Central Europe. Therefore, the Italian government is waiting for Germany to provide assistance to achieve its goals. (Havas, 18th)

French Government

Enabling Act

Expected to Pass the Chamber of Deputies; Opposition Motion Defeated

(Paris) The government's proposed enabling act was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for discussion this morning. Opposition parties immediately proposed motions to oppose it. As a result of the discussion, the motion was defeated by 334 votes to 258, and it was decided to submit the original bill proposed by the government for a vote in the afternoon. (Havas, 18th)

(Paris) French Prime Minister Daladier submitted a resolution to the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, requesting the Chamber to grant full military and other powers to deal with the European situation, which was reviewed and passed by the Chamber's Finance Committee by a vote of 26 to 17. (AP, 8th)

(Paris) After the Chamber of Deputies met this afternoon, Prime Minister Daladier immediately submitted a bill requesting that full powers be granted to the government to take various measures to strengthen France's strength. The bill was submitted for discussion tomorrow afternoon. Members of various parties then delivered speeches, condemning Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia and saying that the agreement signed by Führer Hitler was equal to waste paper and had no value. France must be united to cope with external threats and will never give up an inch of land. Socialist leader Blum said that national unity is a top priority, but he also criticized Prime Minister Daladier's current policies and asked the Prime Minister to step aside for the worthy. Communist member Béry also expressed the same opinion. Then Prime Minister Daladier delivered a speech saying, "I now want to quickly strengthen the country's strength and take appropriate military measures so that the country can act quickly when necessary and not be weaker than the totalitarian countries." (All members cheered. At this time, the whole country must bury their heads in work.) "If my resignation is beneficial to the country, I will not cling to my position for a day, but if I firmly believe that the people want me to continue to work hard, I will stay in office. No matter whether other countries threaten us with force or deceive us with fraud, we will never give up the rights and land we possess. Our country has spared no major sacrifice to maintain peace for twenty years. Now, disappointed, we have to strengthen our strength to cope with the current crisis. We love peace, but we also love our country. Only with a country can we be free people and should do our best to serve it." (Government parties all stood up and cheered) Members of other parties also almost unanimously echoed. (Havas, 17th)

### Germany Makes Economic Demands on Romania

Presented in the Manner of an Ultimatum; Denied by Romania

Bucharest – The claim that Germany has made economic demands on Romania has been denied by responsible parties and denounced as absurd. It is said that German-Romanian negotiations are proceeding in a friendly manner. (Reuters, 18th)

(London) The diplomatic correspondents of The Times and the Daily Telegraph published a message today about Germany presenting Romania with an economic ultimatum. It is said that Huldtart, the leader of the German economic delegation in Romania, in the name of the German government, sent a memorandum to the Romanian government requesting: (1) Romania should issue an order to stop its efforts to transform Romania into an industrial country and limit itself to agriculture; (2) Germany should have complete patent rights to Romania's various exports, such as oil, grain, timber, cattle, and food, etc., and Germany will guarantee Romania's territorial integrity and the independence of its people in return. It is heard that this request has been completely rejected, and all Romanian political parties have therefore abandoned their differences and joined a common front. (Reuters, 18th)

### Carpathian Ukraine Completely Occupied by Hungarian Troops

The Carpathian Army Will Resolutely Resist; Hungarian Regent Personally Inspects

Budapest – According to reliable sources, Hungarian troops have occupied the entire Carpathian Ukraine province. (Havas, 18th)

Budapest – According to a statement issued by the Hungarian General Staff today, Hungarian troops, for the purpose of occupying Carpathian Ukraine, had 37 deaths and 115 injuries. The enemy troops resisting in various places were all defeated and are being cleared. A part of the Hungarian army has reached the Polish border and is in contact with the Polish army. (Haitong, 18th)

Budapest – Regent Horthy arrived in Kaspol this morning, located in the southern part of Carpathian Ukraine, and immediately held a military parade and will continue to inspect various places in Carpathian Ukraine. (Haitong, 18th)

Warsaw – According to news received here, when Hungarian troops advanced into Beregszász in Carpathian Ukraine, there was a fierce bloody battle with the Ukrainian "Sich" Defense Forces and the Czech army. After a bloody hand-to-hand combat, the town was occupied. According to statistics from Warsaw newspapers, the Ukrainian "Sich" Defense Organization has a total of 40,000 officers and soldiers, not including the Czech army. (Haitong, 18th)

Bucharest – News has been received here that the Ukrainian militia is continuing to fight fiercely with Hungarian troops. Both sides are vying for the city of Sevľuš, which is very intense, winning and losing each time, a total of three times. (Havas, 17th)

Warsaw – According to today's collapsed newspaper, the Carpathian Ukraine's "Sich" Defense Organization is currently using the area near Kasyna and the Romanian border as its base to resist the invading Hungarian troops. Carpathian Ukraine's Prime Minister Vološin, before going to Romania, authorized Colonel Jefremov to be responsible for military command. Colonel Jefremov then made various arrangements and obtained the service of some Czech officers, preparing to fight to the death with the Hungarian army. It is heard that the Hungarian army has suffered setbacks in its advance, and in the east, it can only drag on to the vicinity of Kasyna. Ukraine is now concentrating its military power around Mount Pyetros, which is 7,000 feet high. The terrain can be used to give the Hungarian army a head-on blow. News from Khust states that only thirty people died and sixty were injured in the battle today. (Haitong, 18th)

### The Soviet Union Is Prepared and Fearless

Military Strength Enhanced; Economic Self-Sufficiency; Enough to Give Provocateurs a Fatal Blow

(Moscow) The 18th National Congress of the Soviet Communist Party continued yesterday. Deputy Chairman of the People's Committee Kaganovich first delivered a speech, stating that the Federal Government and Stalin are working diligently with a clear goal, that is, to seek remedial methods for the backward sectors of the national economy to ensure that the Soviet Union maintains an independent position economically, is able to cope with the blockade without worry, and the army is fully equipped and confident of victory. It is now comforting to inform you that our country has already possessed this kind of power. Some kinds of our heavy industries have had important progress year by year since 1933, and the national defense industry is the most important. In addition, the efficiency of railway transportation has also doubled compared with 1933. When necessary, our army will definitely receive sufficient and swift supplies." At the meeting, many officers of the army, navy, and air force from various places attended the congress to express their respects to the party representatives. Among them, an army lieutenant who participated in the Zhanggufeng Incident spoke to the congress, saying, "Japanese samurai are arrogant and recklessly waged war last year. We immediately gave them a lesson. In the future, those who incite war will also be given the same lesson. In short, the ability of our nation will be displayed by our border guards." A naval officer then took the floor, saying that Stalin is very concerned about the navy, which is very grateful. Our cruisers, submarines, and torpedo boats in the Baltic Sea, the Pacific Ocean, and the Black Sea are heavily guarded, and safety can be guaranteed. A representative of the Air Force pilots then spoke, saying, "Our Air Force is the best in the world. When necessary, we will do our best to destroy those who incite war." Finally, representatives of the cavalry, mechanized units, and artillery successively spoke, all claiming the strength of the Soviet army. All the representatives at the meeting applauded warmly.

Soviet Development

Far East Fishing Industry Plan

(Moscow) People's Committee for Fisheries Minister Zhemtchuzhina (wife of People's Committee Chairman Molotov) today submitted a report on the Far East fishing industry development plan to the All-Union Congress, stating that this plan stipulates the construction of a large number of fishing boats, refrigerated ships, and cold storage, which will inevitably require the establishment of new bases in the Far East, such as Nikolayevsk, Vladivostok, Sakhalin Island, Khabarovsk, Petropavlovsk, and Komsomolsk. Among them, the cold storage in Khabarovsk, Petropavlovsk, and Komsomolsk should be completed quickly. In addition, 20 cold storage should be built along the coast of Primorsky Krai. It is generally believed that at a time when the fishery disputes between the Soviet Union and Japan have not been resolved, the Soviet government's active development of the Far East fishing industry is noteworthy. (Havas, 18th)

### Stalin's Report (Continued - Part 4)

Stalin continued to state the various tasks of the Communist Party's domestic policy as follows:

First, to continue the policy of developing industry, increasing labor productivity, and improving production technology, so that the Soviet Union, having surpassed the major capitalist countries in production technology and industrial development rate, can further surpass them economically within the next ten to fifteen years; second, to continue the policy of developing agriculture and animal husbandry, so that within the next three to four years, the Soviet Union can produce 800 million poods of grain annually, increase the average yield to 12 to 13 quintals per hectare, increase the yield of industrial crops by an average of 30 to 35 percent, and increase the number of livestock, doubling the number of sheep and pigs, increasing cattle by 40 percent, and horses by 35 percent; third, to continue to improve the material and cultural living standards of workers, peasants, and intellectuals; fourth, to resolutely abide by the socialist constitution, thoroughly implement the democratization of domestic political life, strengthen the moral and political unity of Soviet society, and the harmonious cooperation of workers, peasants, and intellectuals, promote the friendship of all nationalities in the Soviet Union, and cultivate and develop Soviet patriotism; fifth, to pay attention to the surrounding capitalist world, to pay attention to the fact that foreign spy agencies will continue to send spies, assassins, and saboteurs to infiltrate the Soviet Union, and to pay attention to strengthening socialist intelligence agencies to help them systematically crush and eradicate the enemies of the people.

Regarding internal party matters, Stalin pointed out that from the observation of political policies and daily practical work, this period is indeed a period of thorough victory for the Party's general line. After crushing the enemies of the people and purging the corrupt elements of the Party and Soviet organizations, the Party has become more unified politically and organizationally, and more united in supporting the Central Committee. Stalin particularly elaborated on the issue of selecting and promoting cadres, pointing out that the most important aspect in this regard is the bold and timely promotion of young and new cadres. Stalin said, "I believe that some members of our Party still do not fully understand this point. Some people believe that in selection, we should mainly rely on old cadres, while others, on the contrary, believe that we should mainly rely on young cadres. I believe that both are wrong. The question is not whether to rely on old cadres or new cadres, but to properly combine old and new cadres, so that they can blend together to guide the work of the Party and the country. One of the most important achievements of our Party in strengthening Party leadership in this period is the success of the line of combining old and new cadres from top to bottom in the selection of cadres. During this period, the Party has promoted more than 500,000 Party members and young Bolshevik elements close to the Party to national and Party leadership positions, of which more than 20 percent are women."

Stalin then discussed certain theoretical issues, general national issues, and special socialist national issues, as well as the issue of Soviet intellectuals. Stalin strictly criticized the following theory, namely, that the socialist state will wither away, because socialism has been mainly established in the Soviet Union, and the exploiting classes have been eliminated. Stalin pointed out that the creators of this theory underestimated the current international situation, underestimated the fact that the Soviet Union is surrounded by the capitalist world, and underestimated the importance of the bourgeois state and its agencies, because they are sending spies, assassins, and saboteurs to infiltrate the Soviet Union, and are waiting for an opportunity to launch a military attack on the Soviet Union. At the same time, this theory proves that its creators have underestimated the significance of the socialist state and its military, special, and intelligence agencies in defending the Soviet Union and resisting foreign aggression." Stalin continued to point out that since socialism has only triumphed in one country, and that country is surrounded by capitalist countries, there is always a danger of being subjected to military aggression, and that country must have a well-trained army, a tightly organized special agency, and a powerful intelligence agency, and must have its own powerful state apparatus to resist foreign aggression and defend itself. Stalin continued to point out that after the October Revolution, this socialist country experienced two main stages. The task in the first stage was to crush the overthrown classes, organize national defense to resist foreign aggression, restore industry and agriculture, and create conditions for eliminating the remnants of capitalism. The second stage was the period for thoroughly eliminating the remnants of capitalism until the complete victory of the socialist economic system and the adoption of a new constitution. In this stage, the role of domestic armed suppression has become a thing of the past, because the exploiters have been eliminated, and there is no one to suppress. Stalin said that the main tasks of the Soviet Union internally are now economic, organizational, cultural, and constructional peaceful work, while the targets of the army, special agencies, and intelligence agencies are not domestic, but foreign enemies. Stalin then mentioned the question of whether the state will be preserved in the communist era, answering, "Yes, if the capitalist encirclement has not been eliminated, and the threat of foreign military aggression has not been removed, the state will still be preserved." Stalin then discussed the issue of Soviet intellectuals, pointing out that although the Party's position on Soviet intellectuals is very clear, there is still a trend within the Party that is hostile to Soviet intellectuals, which is contrary to the Party's position. At this stage of Soviet development, intellectuals have fundamentally changed in composition and status, have become closely aligned with the people, and are therefore fundamentally different from the old bourgeois intellectuals. Stalin sternly rebuked Party workers who showed an unfriendly attitude towards intellectuals, elaborated on the importance of Soviet intellectuals, and demanded that a friendly and cooperative attitude be adopted towards intellectuals.

Finally, Stalin pointed out that the Soviet working class has proven in practice that the masses can work just as well without exploiters, proving that they can not only destroy the old system, but also build a new and better system, namely, the socialist system, a system free from panic and unemployment. The bourgeois elements of all countries have strongly claimed that peasants cannot take the socialist road, but the collective farmers of the Soviet Union have proven in practice that they can not only take this road, but also succeed greatly. At the end of the report, Stalin congratulated the working class, the collective farmers, the socialist intellectuals, all the harmonious nationalities of the Soviet Union, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. After speaking, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause. When Stalin stepped down from the podium, all the representatives and attendees cheered and paid their respects, warmly expressing their love and support. (To be continued)

### Anti-Communist Axis: Japan Plans to Occupy Hainan Island for a Long Time

To Invade French Territories in South China

Hong Kong Communication, March 14th, English-language Ta Mei Evening Post: According to an International News Service telegram released here, the Japanese army in Hainan Island has hired several German engineers and military experts to draft plans for the island's industry and defense. This may indicate that the Japanese army will

Occupy the island for a long time. The German military experts recently departed from Hong Kong for Haikou, the key port of Hainan Island, to carry out their work. It is reported that some German weapons and new military aircraft are also being unloaded in Haikou to strengthen the Japanese army's position on the island. According to well-informed sources here, the rumor that the Anti-Comintern Pact only unites against communism may be confirmed by this. They have also received

Alarming News from Chongqing regarding the Japanese army's conspiracy to occupy Hainan Island. According to this news, Germany, Italy, and Japan have agreed to strike against Britain and France in Europe and the Far East, supplying General Franco with large quantities of weapons and bombers to launch a sudden attack on France. Meanwhile, the German and Italian fleets in the Mediterranean would harass the British Navy, preventing it from sailing to the Far East. After seizing Hainan Island, Japan would use the island as a base to attack British and French colonies and concessions in South China, such as Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, and Vietnam. Therefore, Japan brazenly invaded Hainan Island, but its axis allies did not implement the plan. This is because Franco suddenly

Changed his mind. Because British Prime Minister Chamberlain had convinced Franco that it would be more valuable to obtain British economic assistance than to conspire against British interests in Europe and the Far East. This conspiracy has failed. The Axis powers are quite disturbed by the premature demise of this conspiracy. This statement may have come from Chinese diplomatic circles overseas, and although it cannot be verified, its impact on South China is significant. Therefore, this intelligence is being critically examined here.

Huang Shaohong Leads Troops

Preparing for a Counteroffensive

Japanese Army Panicked in the Suburbs of Hangzhou

Hangzhou Communication: Huang Shaohong, Chairman of Zhejiang Province, convened a Western Zhejiang Guerrilla Military Conference on the 15th. As a result of the conference, it was decided that he would personally lead the troops of Liu Jianxu and Zhu Xi to launch a joint encirclement of Hangzhou. At the same time, Liu Zuhan, the former Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Water Police Bureau, was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Taihu Lake Water Guerrillas to coordinate operations. Therefore, in the past week, the Japanese army in Hangzhou has become increasingly busy with security in the suburbs of Hangzhou. Collecting materials and rushing to build gun emplacements and dig trenches in the areas of Chenghuang Mountain, Yuhuang Mountain, Jiuhua Mountain, Taohua Mountain, and Houchaomen. Mortar teams from Chuan Yuan are stationed in Mantou Mountain, Nanxing Bridge, and other places. Strong fortifications have been built in front of each camp gate. The puppet police department is registering West Lake yachts and designating the Hubin Pier as a mooring place. Except for two bridges, the Su Causeway has been cut off from traffic. The public is checked daily, and even their clothes are stripped off.

### The Chinese Army in Northern Jiangsu Fights Bravely in Counteroffensive, Continuing to Recapture Huaian and Funing

Fierce Battles in Xiannvmiao and Shaobo. The Japanese Army Transfers Back to Zhenjiang from Yangzhou

Taixian Communication: In recent days, the war in Northern Jiangsu has become more and more intense. A certain unit of the Chinese forces is fighting very bravely. The army first recaptured Siyang and Lianshui, and then surrounded Huaiyin and Huaian overnight. On the 10th, they recaptured the county seat of Huaian, and the Japanese army retreated to Huaiyin. The battle in Funing has also intensified. The Japanese army intends to open up the Tongyu Provincial Highway and actively invade southwards. A certain unit of the Chinese army, in coordination with the guerrilla forces, is blocking them closely. For days, they have been fighting bravely in the heavy rain, annihilating many Japanese soldiers. The Japanese side then sent planes to bomb various towns in Yancheng and arbitrarily strafed fleeing civilians. As for Yangzhou and other places, the Japanese army has made no progress. On the 11th, the Chinese army again launched a fierce attack on the Japanese positions in Xiannvmiao and Shaobo, fighting fiercely through the night in the rain, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Japanese headquarters in Yangzhou is now urgently requesting reinforcements from Zhenjiang. On the morning of the 10th, more than 400 reinforcements from Zhenjiang set off for Yangzhou to transfer to Shaobo to provide support. At 2:00 p.m., more than 100 Japanese soldiers crossed the river to Xiannvmiao to reinforce the Japanese soldiers in Xiannvmiao. The Japanese soldiers in Xiannvmiao are now forcibly sealing small carts and recruiting many civilian laborers, and their intentions are unclear. Also, on the 12th, it was confirmed that a certain division commander led his troops to recapture the county seat of Funing, and the entire Japanese army fled to Shuyang. According to an investigation, there are many bandit troops such as Li Shouxin and Liu Guitang in this invading Japanese army, and their strength is simply不堪一擊 (unable to withstand a single blow).

Chinese Guerrillas Attack Zhenjiang. The Chinese guerrilla forces in Jiangnan took advantage of the Japanese army's current attention to the war situation in Northern Jiangsu to launch a large-scale guerrilla war to strike the Japanese army, causing the Japanese side to be overwhelmed. At this moment, the guerrilla army has launched a fierce battle with the Japanese in the area of Zhenjiang. On the previous day, the Japanese Central China Army in Zhenjiang had transferred four or five hundred men to Yangzhou and Xiannvmiao in order to invade Gaoyou Zhaoguan Dam to provide support. The Japanese army in Northern Jiangsu suddenly heard this news and suddenly returned to Zhenjiang on the 11th and 12th. On the 12th, dozens of cavalrymen also crossed the river from Yangzhou to Zhenjiang, dragging two heavy artillery pieces with them. The situation was unusually hurried and flustered. For a time, the situation in Jiangbei also became relatively relaxed.

The Army Forcibly Drafts Laborers On the Spot. Because of the difficulty in replenishing troops domestically, the Japanese side had set up recruitment offices in the Zhenjiang area last year to lure young people in the guerrilla areas to serve as puppet soldiers. However, the young people in various places were all deeply aware of righteousness, and the Japanese side had no way to do anything. Starting from this month, they began to check households in various cities and towns in Yangzhou and Zhenjiang, forcibly conscripting them into the army. The situation is extremely tense. At present, most of the young people in the cities and towns of Zhenjiang and Yangzhou have fled to other places out of fear. The Japanese headquarters has ordered the heads of each baojia (administrative unit) to be responsible for retrieving them, and has tightened the defense of the city gates. All men between the ages of 16 and 45 are only allowed to enter, not to exit. The Yangzhou Japanese Yi Fu Ban (pacification unit) has also notified the puppet organization of the county, limiting them to demolish the civilian houses outside Nantou within a few days to build a large-scale training ground.

Chinese Army in Nanhui

Repels Japanese Army

Pudong Communication: At 7:00 a.m. on the 10th, hundreds of Japanese soldiers attacked Nanhui County by land and water from Zhuqiao. At that time, the defenders of the city were Li Wenyuan of the First Battalion and Tao Zengzhi of the Third Battalion of the Fourth Detachment of the Zhongyi Jiuguo Army (Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army) under Yu Taosheng. Seeing the arrival of the Japanese army, they were immediately directed by Captain Li Wenyuan to guard the four gates and resist bravely. The Japanese army used small steel cannons and machine guns to concentrate their firepower, and although the attack was fierce, they were ultimately unable to make any progress due to the solid city walls and the dedicated defense of the soldiers. Detachment Commander Yu Taosheng immediately ordered Deputy Commander Zhai Pengkui to lead a special service battalion to outflank the left wing, the Fourth and Sixth Battalions to attack the right wing, and the Bao Wei Tuan (Defense Corps) to attack the rear. After a fierce battle of more than four hours, the Chinese encirclement troops were getting closer and closer, charging and fighting hand-to-hand, killing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers and capturing many weapons. This was an unprecedented victory in the Pudong guerrilla warfare. The Shanghai gentry from Pudong are planning to慰勞 (comfort and reward) the troops.

### Guangdong Social Service Center Handles Traveler Registration

Qujiang Communication: The Guangdong Provincial Social Service Center, in view of the fact that many people have been displaced since the outbreak of the war in South China, often sees notices in newspapers and busy streets of transportation hubs seeking missing persons. However, this has had little effect. In order to facilitate people from all walks of life to easily inquire about the news of relatives and friends, a Traveler Communication Registration Office was established on March 1st in the Personnel Consulting Office of the center to handle the matter. People from all walks of life, if they arrive in Shaoguan (i.e., Qujiang County) or leave the country, and want to make it easier for relatives and friends to inquire, can register their communication address at the center. At the same time, a Traveler Inquiry Office was established at the Qujiang Station of the Yuehan Railway. Any merchants and travelers who arrive in Shaoguan, Guangdong Province for the first time and are unfamiliar with the place and various situations and need to inquire, the center is responsible for providing guidance and various conveniences. Since its establishment, it has been convenient for merchants and travelers, and they do not feel difficulty even if they are unfamiliar with the place.

### Qingpu Opium Public Sales

Puppet County Office Forcibly Conscripts Laborers

Qingpu Communication: The Qingpu puppet county office, recently realizing that the Japanese army stationed in Qingpu is weak, in order to curry favor and benefit itself, forcibly conscripts laborers to organize the Bao Wei Tuan (Defense Corps) to deal with the guerrilla teams in the surrounding villages. It ordered the puppet baojia (administrative unit) heads to be responsible for the conscription, with 30 people as a small squad and three small squads as a large squad. Each large squad is led by six to twelve Japanese soldiers and will be stationed in various towns in the suburbs after the conscription is completed. Each town must pay a monthly 保衛捐 (defense donation), stipulated to be from 30 yuan per village, 50 yuan per township, and 100 yuan per town. Wang Daoxing, the puppet director of the Qingpu Unified Tax Bureau, and Xu Bainian, the puppet director of the Finance Bureau, have been dismissed one after another. They contacted a group of local ruffians and established more than 30 opium sales and smoking dens in various places in the city and suburbs. In the Tang family residence in the Yuhang Bridge area in the city, a special goods store was set up, openly selling drugs. The puppet county office collects taxes from each sales and smoking den on a monthly basis.

### Picturesque Scenery: Song Zheyuan Recuperates in Yangshuo

County Magistrate's Paltry Salary Makes for a Meager Life; Zhang Guoquan Discusses Li Bai's Valor in Battle

From a Regular Correspondent in Yangshuo

Yangshuo Correspondence, February: It is precisely the season when the rains return to the southern lands. At the invitation of an international friend stationed in Guilin, I stole away for a visit to Yangshuo. The car drove out of Guilin's south gate, heading towards the road to Yangshuo. The suburbs of Guilin and the mountain mists gradually dissolved into the heavy morning fog. Damp clouds in the sky pushed out from the dense peaks, drifting like fathers traveling to another group of mountains and forests. Sometimes they brought a misty drizzle, sometimes accompanied by slightly cold droplets of water. A thin layer of yellow mud floated on the highway. Some shallow bumps reflected the mountain shadows, occasionally causing the heavy car tires to splash up yellow, muddy water. The busy wartime transport gave the highway a sense of hardship. From both sides of the road, farmland and pine forests extended directly to the nearby foothills. If it was a loess hill, then the hardworking Guangxi farmers would cultivate the land from the foot of the hill to the mountainside. The crops, which could not be seen clearly, were firmly facing the wind and rain. Nearby, rapeseed flowers, like gold scattered on the ground, swept past the car in large patches. The broad beans in the paddy fields had also blossomed with purple petals. This was just like the rural scene of late spring in Jiangnan, evoking the homesickness of this Jiangnan native. The car caught up with the First Regiment of Guangxi Student Soldiers who had departed from Guilin to work in the south. These more than one thousand young men and women, after three months of training in Guilin, were now going to mobilize and organize the people of the south, preparing to defend the country and protect the people when necessary. Fully armed, they marched on the muddy roadside and in the fields. This green youth team was treading the battlefield to protect the mountains and fields behind them. From Guilin to Yangshuo is sixty-four kilometers, or one hundred and twenty Chinese miles. The closer to Yangshuo, the more one felt a clear distinction between Yangshuo and the mountains near Guilin. The mountains of Guilin are undeniably strange, their strangeness lies in the stone, while the mountains of Yangshuo are mostly draped in a thorny cloak, lush and green, concealing the rugged rocks, especially showing a kind of ancient and elegant demeanor. The highway, within thirty or twenty miles north of Yangshuo, almost winds back and forth between the strange rocks.

Glimpses of Governance: Yangshuo is bordered by the Li River to the east, and surrounded by layered mountain peaks on the west, north, and south sides. The county town is limited by the mountains and rivers, and the area may not even reach four square miles. The population is only over three hundred families. Apart from the market days on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th of each month, there is no commerce to speak of. The Baisha Market eighteen miles north of the county town, the Fuli Market in the southeast, and the Xingping Market thirty to forty miles northeast surround it. These market towns have several times more people than the county town, and have livelier streets that the county town lacks. They make the county town isolated and desolate. I met with County Magistrate Zhu Mo and Deputy County Magistrate Liu Biguang several times. They maintained the simplicity and sincerity of Guangxi administrative officials. The county magistrate, in the past, and even now outside of Guangxi, is still the "lord of a hundred miles," the so-called "parent official," but County Magistrate Zhu's monthly salary is 150 Guangxi dollars (75 legal currency). Although the government stipulates that the county magistrate can get one percent of the reward from the land tax revenue each year, he is, after all, a county magistrate, with many unavoidable expenses and social engagements. Therefore, he is still unable to bring his family from his hometown in Hubei to Yangshuo. Currently, the county government's monthly office expenses are only 200 yuan. The cost of lamp oil alone is more than 100 yuan, which forces him to restrict the hours the county government lights are on. He often has to instruct the clerks to save on paper and pens to balance income and expenses. From this, I believe that his life is hard. Yangshuo County is full of mountains and few villages, a poor fourth-class county with an annual balanced income and expenditure of 120,000 yuan. The largest income is the land tax surcharge. The land surcharge and local product tax account for three-tenths, and public property income accounts for one-tenth. Administrative and education expenses each account for three and seven-tenths of the total expenditure. There is one county high school, over forty central primary schools, and over one hundred and sixty primary schools. According to County Magistrate Zhu, there are no school-age children out of school in the county. Adult education is also actively promoted, and the illiteracy rate has been reduced to the lowest number. Comparatively, the illiteracy rate among women is still higher than that of men, because Guangxi women work longer hours than men. As for the rural women living in remote mountains and poor valleys, there are more inconveniences in both promoting and receiving education, but in general, it can be said that illiteracy has been eliminated. The county has sent over one thousand men to war, and there are still over seventeen thousand reserve soldiers under the age of thirty and thirty thousand under the age of ten, all of whom have been trained by the village chiefs and know basic tactical knowledge. Deputy County Magistrate Liu is a graduate of the Japanese Military Academy. His hair is already gray, but he still retains the spirit of a young soldier. I saw him braving the rain to give a speech to six companies of militia in the public sports field. Those militia members were recommended by the villages, five from each village. They provided their own guns, ammunition, and clothing, and brought their own food to the county to receive a month of guerrilla warfare training, and then brought what they had learned back to teach the other able-bodied men who had received ordinary military training. When Deputy County Magistrate Liu led me to visit their dormitory, I felt that they got along like family members. What impressed me most was that Yangshuo County now has several guerrilla warfare bases. Those projects were completed under the guidance of the two county magistrates in cooperation with the people.

A Landscape Like a Painting: I did not have much time to enjoy the Li River by boat, so I could only wander around the suburbs with a cane. Guangxi Province originally had a plan to develop Yangshuo into a scenic area. Yangshuo County also had an organization to manage and construct the scenic area. In fact, the scenery of Yangshuo does not need any further "construction." The so-called construction is just to add some pavilions and terraces to the cliffs and bays. After County Magistrate Zhu took office, in view of the fact that both the province and the county had no surplus funds to carry out everything, he was preparing to invite celebrities at home and abroad to donate money for construction, and name the buildings after them to commemorate them. However, after the Lugou Bridge Incident, this matter could only be postponed until after the victory. In the valley west of the city and east of the highway, the two hundred-foot-high Old Man Mountain and the Solitary Beauty Peak stand like bonsai. Around the two strange peaks, the prototype of Yangshuo Park has been completed. Old Man Mountain is only a few hundred steps around. At the foot of the mountain, there are caves that can be traversed and a "Stream Viewing Terrace" from which one can overlook. Climbing up the mountain on the steep and winding stone steps, there is a pavilion halfway up called "Meeting Immortals," probably because it faces a cracked human-shaped rock. The top of the mountain is less than two square feet, and there is a pavilion called "Gathering Talents," from which one can have a panoramic view of the city. The highway, close at hand, meanders softly into the narrow valley of Ma'anshan. In the distance, the flowing water of the Li River quietly reflects the undulating mountain shadows. Opposite, several mountain crows, with an air of being independent from the world, fly and perch on the Solitary Beauty Peak that cannot be climbed. It is truly a landscape like a painting. Bilian Cave is the largest stone cave in Yangshuo, with stalactites stacked upon each other, deep, dark, and grand. The north entrance is being renovated by stone workers hired by Song Zheyuan, who is recuperating in Yangshuo, and the four characters "Zhong Shan Xian Ji" (Gathering of All Virtues) are engraved on the cave wall. It can accommodate hundreds of people to avoid air raids. The scenery along the Li River is relatively bright and open, with a small stone road rising and falling southward, leaning against the cliffs above and facing the rapid currents below. The river water from the north turns here, colliding with the stone bank and forming countless whirlpools, creating patches of white foam that slowly dissipate along with the flowing water until it reaches the "Paoshui Ferry" crossing. Someone has written a large character "Dai" (Belt) on the cliff, which is a vivid depiction of the Li River passing through Yangshuo.

Visiting Song Zheyuan: In the past, standing at the entrance of the Ma'anshan valley, one could see a large area of sugarcane fields and a local sugar mill on the west bank of the Li River. Now, part of the sugarcane field is surrounded by a new bamboo fence. Under a few tall palm trees, three single-story houses are scattered on the land. That is "Jinde New Village," and every resident of Yangshuo knows that it is General Song Zheyuan's villa. Walking through the fence gate, bypassing a row of bamboo screens, is a small hall, with a guard room and a garage on both sides. Turning a bend, one sees a guard carrying a holster and holding the famous broadsword of the Twenty-Ninth Army. He handed my business card to Song's chief secretary, Gao Zihou, who immediately extended his welcome. After ending his mission as Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the First War Zone, Song had recuperated in Hengshan for some time. In the second half of last year, he bought land here and built a house because he loved the mountains and rivers of Yangshuo. He is now suffering from mild hemiplegia and can only barely walk in the garden. His family watches over him, and politely declines visits from guests on his behalf. Chief Gao is a rigorous Shandong man who once served as the Secretary-General of the Chahar Provincial Government. We had a very pleasant conversation. People who have lived in the north for a long time are not used to the humid climate in the mountains of Yangshuo, where the sun has not been seen for months, but wandering in the mountains and rivers in the morning and evening, apart from the busy schedule of war, is not without its pleasures. According to Chief Gao, "Song has recently taken up the post of member of the Military Affairs Commission in Yangshuo, and has telegraphed Chairman Chiang for leave. As soon as he recovers, he will go to Chongqing to attend meetings. In addition to Madam Song, his sons and daughters, and several secretaries and clerks, there are more than sixty guards here. Song sometimes gives speeches to his subordinates, hoping that they will become useful to the country. Song is currently taking Chinese medicine and is expected to recover in a month, which should be enough." Song gets up at eight in the morning and rests around ten in the evening. His daily life consists of writing, reading scriptures, and taking walks. The new village covers more than thirty mu, and the land cost more than one thousand yuan. Although Song cannot live in Yangshuo for a long time, the construction of the houses is still very solid, costing more than one thousand yuan each. In the future, he plans to give this new village to the county government as local property. Song is fifty-six years old this year. When Chief Gao sent me out of the village, I caught a glimpse of him wearing casual clothes, holding a cane, and chatting with his wife and daughters in the courtyard. He looked very healthy. Song is very optimistic about the future of the war of resistance. He believes that Wu Peifu will never be fooled. (To be continued)

### Eight Thousand Fans Cheer Enthusiastically: Lido Wins the Scott Cup

Defeats the Westerners 4-3 with a Wonderful Performance, Only Glorious Achievement of This Year's Football Season

The Lido football team, with an extremely wonderful performance, perfect cooperation, and a fierce battle of ninety minutes yesterday, finally defeated the fierce Westerners 4-3 in the final, regaining the Scott Cup that had been separated from the Chinese for years. In the first half, Lido took the lead with 4-2. Yesterday, the weather was sunny and the more than eight thousand spectators at the amusement park cheered like thunder. After the game, Mr. Borge, the acting chairman of the Western Football Association, personally awarded the Scott Cup, which had been held by the British Army Doum team, to Lido captain Li Yichen, and delivered a congratulatory speech. According to the Scott Cup, which has been held since 1902, only in 1935 and 1936 did Donghua hold it for two consecutive years. The rest were all held by Western teams. Since it fell to the French Chamber of Commerce in 1937, it fell into the hands of the British Army Doum last year. This season, Lido, with the qualification of a C-level team, defeated strong enemies and won the championship, winning a lot of glory for the Chinese.

### Besieging the Westerners' Goal

— (Photo by Zhang Hong)

Fierce Battle Decides the Winner: Yesterday, the two sides were evenly matched, with many wonderful moments. Lido's Xu Wenkui performed the best, and he deserves the first credit. Li Yichen also worked very hard. Cao and Zhang on the wings had good constructions from time to time. Zhang Mingsheng's corner kicks were accurate and unparalleled. Wang Kehou was less impressive. The center back line was not strong. Sun Jinshun was stationed at the rear, repeatedly saving dangerous balls, with more merit than demerit. Zhang Lingen was still barely satisfactory. Goalkeeper Lu Zhongen still inevitably had a tendency to carelessness. Westerner goalkeeper Willie's performance was far above Zhongen's. His position was particularly good. The four goals conceded were really difficult to save. The center and back guards were all abnormal, and the ball was often kicked to the rear, and loopholes frequently appeared. The key to failure lies in this. Forward Qian is still called active. The central forward's shots were very fierce. Right winger Hutlai had many brilliant moments. Left winger Huo Gengsheng already felt old and weak. Lido's victory did not come easily.

Each Score One Goal: The Westerners attacked first, with Huisihute kicking remotely. Changjiaolu received the ball and passed it forward. Wang Kehou dribbled the ball and approached, passing it to Cao Qiuting. Cao hooked towards the center. Turner pulled his foot to save, and the ball flew backwards. Willie jumped up and pressed it down, avoiding a major mistake. Fengdu sent troops to attack the enemy camp. The Westerners saved a corner kick. Zhang Mingsheng kicked it in. The angle was very good.

Jinshun fouled, and Tefe kicked two free kicks in a row from twenty yards away, both missing. Xu Wenkui got a pass from Zhang Mingsheng and picked it up, but Wang Kehou failed to intercept it and also missed a good opportunity. At the tenth minute, Tefe came from the middle, picking up Hutlai. Hu hooked in, and Greenburg took a shot, and the ball entered the bottom corner. Changjiaolu did not save it, and it became a tie.

Xu and Wang Both Make Contributions: The Westerners launched another attack. Hutlai hooked and sent it to Greenburg.

Tielitui saved the ball carelessly, kicking it into the hinterland. Peida lightly passed it to Hutlai, who passed it to Greenburg again. Greenburg's shot was too soft. Zhongen lay down and扑住了。离上半场休息仅五分钟，活更生从左窜进，妙钧门前，培特额角有眼，西捕卒夺回一球。继培达得杰勃逊遥送，铁腿出阻落空，培于十码处攻门幸偏斜未中。李义臣高射敌门，威利扑空再扑，始吿脱险。迨上半场终了前一分钟，曹秋亭主开角球，李义臣顶上开花，亦得一功，上半时丽都以四对二佔先。

Lido Wins the Silver Cup: Changing sides to fight again, within a minute, Hutlai, with lightning speed, dribbled to the baseline and crossed. Zhongen touched it, and the ball hit the crossbar and bounced down. Greenburg stepped forward and greeted it, touching it into the door. The Westerners had already created a situation of 3 to 4, only one goal behind, and the attack was more urgent. The Westerners' hinterland was full of enemy cavalry. Huo Gengsheng got the ball kicked by Sun Jinshun, rushed forward and hooked it in. Zhongen was tall and hugged the ball out of danger. Peiter got Hutlai's pass and swept angrily, fortunately hitting the goalpost. Lido saw that the situation was not good and changed from defense to attack. Wenkui fired, and Willie lay down and扑住了滑去。迨义臣冲上，球巳被威利将身压住。杰勃逊远射，格林堡头顶，均被钟恩救出。卅六分钟，王克厚得李义臣派司，传递许文奎，许杀入禁区无人来挡，怪脚起处，竟吿偏逸，西捕虽极图挣扎，无奈心餘力绌，时间吿终，丽都以叫对三荣膺冠军。

### Soy Bean Industry Announcement: Suppressing Private Transactions

Implementing Regulations on April 1st, Making Every Effort to Dredge Grain Sources

After seven groups including the soybean industry formed a grain evaluation committee, the committee has sent personnel to investigate the total amount of rice stored in the city, evaluate the market price of rice at any time, and make every effort to dredge the sources. The market announced to suppress private transactions, and those who violate it will be punished. The details are as follows:

Suppression of Private Transactions in the Market

The Soybean Industry Association announced in the market that in order to ensure the stability of the business of all parties, the association has repeatedly stipulated that the photos should be affixed to the admission cards of all brokers and salespersons, and advised non-members to organize formal firms. The above methods have been announced and implemented successively. Now, the scope of business of brokers and the methods of guarantee and punishment are discussed and decided as follows. The seal of the broker's guarantee firm must be affixed with the official firm's seal, and a deposit of 20 yuan must be paid. The business scope of the broker shall be limited to selling to firms of the same industry in the market. In the future, those who engage in private transactions shall be punished. The penalties are as follows: (1) Those who violate the regulations for the first time shall be fined 20 yuan in national currency, the second time shall be fined 50 yuan, and the third time the person's admission card will be revoked. The fines shall be paid in full within three days, and if overdue, the deposit will be used to offset the amount. If the amount is insufficient, the guarantor shall be responsible for making up the difference. (2) Half of all fines shall be used for charitable donations and half shall be used as rewards for reporters. The above measures will be implemented from April 1st of this year. It is imperative to record and announce it, and all brokers and their guarantor shall abide by it. This is very important and hereby announced.

Allocation of Stored Rice and Dredging Sources

The Grain Evaluation Committee has designated Jin Shiquan to investigate the amount of rice stored in various rice firms and warehouses in the city as a reference for evaluating the price of rice. As soon as the investigation form is printed, it will be started immediately. The rice price evaluated by the committee must be uniformly observed by all firms, and those who violate it will be severely punished. At the same time, measures will be taken to suppress hoarding and manipulation. As for the rice and grain in the producing areas, after the various groups advised the vendors to purchase, the goods have been arriving in recent days, and the market price of rice has dropped. However, yesterday it was rumored in the market that the Japanese puppets controlled the food in their occupied areas and stopped issuing permits for moving goods from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. At the same time, Wuhu prohibited the transportation of rice and grain to Shanghai, which caused the market price of rice to suddenly rebound by one corner. However, the above rumors remain to be confirmed.

### Japanese Side Arrests German Ship Passengers Again

Six People Arrested in Two Days, All by Japanese Personnel

Liulu Bao reports that according to responsible sources yesterday (17th), six Chinese people were arrested by Japanese personnel active in the Public Concession in each of the past two days. It is reported that three of them were passengers on the German ship Hanna, and were arrested on the ship when the ship was about to dock at the Bund of the French Concession. The other three were reportedly arrested by the Shanghai Municipal Police at the request of the Japanese side and handed over to the Japanese side yesterday. A team of plainclothes Japanese personnel boarded the Hanna for a search. It is believed that these Japanese people belong to the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces. After they arrested the three Chinese people on board, they took a motorboat and sailed to Hongkou.

### Jardine Matheson's Suiwo Steamer Damaged by Izumo Battleship

Suiwo Entered Port Izumo Headed Straight, Gun Barrel Touched Second Deck, Deck Completely Destroyed

Jardine Matheson's Yangtze River steamer Suiwo, with a deadweight of more than 2,000 tons, has been sailing the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to Xingan, Zhanghuanggang, Niantuo Port, Hupu and other ports since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War and the blockade of the Yangtze River. Yesterday, the ship came to Shanghai from Zhanghuanggang and Niantuo Port, loaded with war pigs, cattle, chickens, eggs and other goods. When it entered port at about 2 p.m., it saw the Japanese warship Izumo heading straight at it when it passed the Yushichang Poomian at 2:30 p.m. The Izumo left the Mitsubishi Wharf at the northern end of Baidu Bridge at 2 o'clock and was about to leave the port. When the two ships met there, the Suiwo

Saw the Izumo Heading Straight

It was extremely dangerous, so it sounded a whistle to give way. Unexpectedly, there was a Japanese small transport ship on the right, with its bow facing the west bank and its stern facing east, lying across the river, so it could not give way to the right. It quickly stopped, but the Japanese warship still sailed straight down. The Suiwo slightly moved its bow to the right to block it, and the Japanese warship sailed past on the left. The warship was equipped with gun emplacements on both sides, and the gun barrels

Exposed Outside the Hull

Therefore, when passing the Suiwo, the gun barrel touched the second deck of the Suiwo, and the left side of the plank berth and the two rooms of the account room and officer's cabin in the steerage passenger cabin were scratched by the muzzle of the gun, and completely damaged. The railings and iron pillars on the side of the ship were also knocked down. A Taiping sampan on the upper deck was also damaged, and a passenger was slightly injured in the head. After the accident, the Suiwo sailed to Shanghai as usual and docked at the Bund Wharf of Beijing Road at about 3 p.m. The crew immediately

Reported to the Company

After the Izumo damaged the Suiwo, it also docked at the Junpu Bureau Wharf near Wusong to see if the ship was damaged. It is said that after receiving the report, the manager and chief shipowner of Jardine Matheson went to the Izumo to negotiate. The outcome is unknown. The Suiwo was originally scheduled to leave port this morning, but due to the serious damage, it needs to be repaired and will be temporarily suspended.

### Japanese Planes Bombing Foreign Industries Triggers Serious Accusations

Western Reporters Ask Questions, Japanese Representatives Equivocate

The mainland reported that at the reception for reporters held by the Japanese side last night (17th), reporters questioned the Japanese planes' attacks on Nanchang and Pingjiang. The Japanese spokesman replied that the foreign flags and marks placed on buildings adjacent to Chinese military institutions had no value, and even if they did, they were very small. A reporter asked the spokesman to provide details of the attack on Pingjiang. At that time, a long discussion began about Japanese pilots bombing foreign industries.

The spokesman replied that we have not received further details, and the army spokesman was absent. He did not know that there were Chinese military institutions near the US Methodist Church school bombed on Wednesday. A reporter asked whether Japanese air force reconnaissance personnel had discovered any British industries in Pingjiang marked with flags or marks. The spokesman replied that he had not received any news that foreign industries had been bombed during the air raid on Wednesday, so this question was not valid. The reporter who asked the question replied that he was not asking whether

There Are Foreign Industries

Was bombed, just asking whether the authorities knew about the foreign industries in Pingjiang. The spokesman replied that there was no news. In reply to another question, he said that the Japanese army and navy authorities consulted the maps provided by the foreign consulates before starting the attack. However, these maps were not very detailed, so the Japanese side repeatedly asked the foreign authorities to provide detailed information about the location of foreign industries. A reporter asked, the Japanese authorities have repeatedly stated that the destroyed industries were not clearly marked, so foreign industries

How Should It Be Marked

So that it will not be bombed? The spokesman replied that this matter needs to be investigated, and the weather conditions are very different. A reporter asked, why did the Japanese side destroy three clearly marked American industries in three air raids? The spokesman replied that Chinese troops often set up military institutions near foreign industries, and said that there was an air raid shelter for General Chiang Kai-shek under the Central Bank Building in Hankou. A reporter asked,

Is General Chiang Kai-shek

A military target? He also asked whether there were any military targets near the British Church industries in Pingjiang. The spokesman replied that since it had not been heard that the foreign industries in Pingjiang had been damaged, these questions did not need to be discussed. A reporter asked, there are four American industries in Yichang, and three of them were bombed. This is a special example, and we would like to know the details. The spokesman replied, we have not received sufficient information, but it is possible that anti-aircraft fire forced the Japanese plane to fly high. A reporter asked, did the Japanese side not say that the air raid on Yichang

Did Not Encounter Anti-Aircraft Guns

The spokesman replied that it was the first time, and the Japanese plane was attacked by anti-aircraft guns during other air raids. A reporter said that in one air raid, American industries were hit by seventeen bombs, four of which nearly hit the 20-foot-long American flag. The spokesman replied that if this was true, it would need to be investigated. The reporter again mentioned the American industries in Yichang.

During an Air Raid

Being hit by seventeen bombs, he said that this was either indiscriminate bombing or the bomber's skills were poor. The spokesman replied to other questions that bombing could not be accurate if the weather was not clear. All these problems require further study, but as mentioned above, the only target of Japanese bombers is the military.

### Japanese Side Secretly Sets Up Plainclothes Headquarters in Concession

Concession Authorities Pay Serious Attention, But Japanese Side Vigorously Denies

Modern News Agency reports that according to reliable sources on the foreign side, the Japanese side, on the pretext of preventing terrorist incidents in the concession, has set up a plainclothes headquarters in a certain hotel on Hankou Road since the establishment of an agreement with the Public Works Department, and has recruited a large number of ruffians to engage in investigation and arrest work. The concession authorities learned of the matter and believed that the Japanese side's move was completely illegal and had no basis in the signed agreement, and obviously hindered the administration of the concession, so they negotiated with the Japanese side to ban it. However, the Japanese side vigorously denied that there was an incident of setting up a plainclothes headquarters, and said that the rooms opened in a certain hotel were entirely for entertainment and recreation, and there was no other purpose. At present, the concession authorities are still paying serious attention to this and investigating all its actions.

### Mr. Ma Xiangbo's 100th Birthday Today

Fudan Alumni Association to Hold Celebration Tonight at Xin Xin

The Fudan University Alumni Association, as Mr. Ma is the founder of the school, is celebrating his longevity, and has decided to hold a celebration at the Xin Xin Restaurant on Guizhou Road at 6 p.m. today. Those who wish to join can request temporarily. The association will also publish a special issue celebrating Mr. Ma Xiangbo's 100th birthday and distribute it to the participants. Outsiders can also send a letter to the association to request it. Mr. Ma recently sent a letter to the association saying, "To my fellow Fudan students, I have learned from the newspaper that your association will hold a celebration in Shanghai for my 100th birthday, which shows that you have not forgotten me from afar. However, since the outbreak of the war, the country has been in turmoil and the people have been struggling. Why should an old man like me be wandering in a foreign land? I am ashamed of my lack of virtue and merit, and I am afraid of living a long and disgraceful life. I am ashamed to be celebrated. Thinking back to the establishment of your school, talents have emerged in large numbers, excelling in all fields. You have both devoted yourselves to self-cultivation and vowed to govern the country. I am truly honored. I would like to express my gratitude and wish you all progress in your studies. Your elder, Xiangbo." Mr. Xiangbo's recent photo and original letter are printed above to express our admiration.

### Fu Cheng Linsheng Is Also Willing to Be a Puppet

Going to Hankou to Serve as a Puppet "Mayor," Leaving Shanghai Quietly with Di Feiyuan

Modern News Agency reports that Cheng Linsheng, a real estate businessman in this city, was originally a well-known wealthy businessman with a large amount of accumulated assets. After the January 28th Incident, the real estate business in Shanghai failed, and Cheng fell sharply, getting worse and worse, and eventually sold his private residence on Maitehesi Road. His experience was quite tragic. For several years, he lived a difficult life and was no longer noticed by people. According to sources from relevant parties, Cheng, due to his desolate situation and boredom, disregarded his integrity and was willing to be a puppet. He had close contacts with the puppet organization, trying to take up a puppet position to make a fortune. Soon, he was attracted by Chen Fumu and met with the conspirator Doihara, who promised him the position of puppet "Mayor of Hankou." Cheng was flattered and left Shanghai quietly with Doihara and Chen Fumu a few days ago to engage in activities.

Japanese Long-Term Government Bonds

Astonishing Amount

More Than 16.9 Billion Yen

The mainland reported that the Japanese government's long-term government bonds had reached 16,914,719,000 yen at the end of last month, an increase of 29,344,000 yuan compared with January. In addition to these interest-bearing perpetual loans, the Tokyo government's short-term government bonds issued in the name of rice coupons reached 468,612,000 yuan, and those issued in the name of silk coupons reached 7,025,000 yuan. At the end of February, Japan's total domestic debt amounted to 15,635,004,000 yuan, an increase of 301,167,000 yuan compared with January. The total foreign debt was 1,279,715,000 yuan, a decrease of 3,733,000 yuan. The increase in domestic debt was mainly due to the issuance of the China Incident National Treasury Bonds and the 3.5% interest National Treasury Bonds to make up for the shortage of military expenses.

### Japanese Military Authorities Indulge Soldiers in Rape and Murder

If Not, They Cannot Fight, Chinese Women Suffer Trampling

Mainland News Agency reports that Agnes Smedley, a well-known writer who is currently with the New Fourth Route Army, wrote an article in this week's Millard's Review of the Far East explaining that the massacres, rapes, and looting committed by Japanese soldiers in China were caused by the brutal treatment of these people by their officers. According to Ms. Smedley's article, it is now fully proven that senior Japanese commanders deliberately savage their soldiers, and if not, the war cannot continue, because the general

Japanese soldiers are concerned about the poverty of their families at home. Many Japanese officers lead and command their troops to burn, loot, rape and kill. If you read the captured Japanese letters and diaries, you can see that the Japanese army is now gradually becoming savage in their diaries. The only thing that Japanese soldiers do in the entire Nanjing and Zhenjiang area where I am now is either kill people or

Chase Women

It is not true to say that the Japanese army only uses Chinese prostitutes to vent their desires, because the prostitutes in the whole of China are not enough to fill the Japanese brothels in Hongkou, Shanghai. Most of the women in the "Imperial Army Comfort Station" are captured women. Civilized people cannot turn a blind eye to this today and say that the women raped by the Japanese army are prostitutes. This statement is not true. If the Japanese army wins this war, then what Chinese women

Are Suffering

Women in other countries will also suffer. The intellectual and spiritual development of the Japanese army is almost the same as that of Genghis Khan's troops hundreds of years ago. The only difference is the mere appearance. In fact, the Japanese army is fighting in China today, which is quite like the barbaric Mongolian army at that time.

Japanese Warships in Sanmen Bay Are

Repelled by Garrison

East Zhejiang Coast Is Peaceful, Population Is Being Evacuated. Three Japanese warships were discovered on the sea off Jiantiao, Sanmen Bay on the 15th. They first strafed the shore with machine guns, and then released a small boat carrying more than ten Japanese soldiers, who drove to Maotou Mountain in Ninghai County, attempting to

Forcibly Land

To search for food, chickens, pigs, sheep, etc. from the people. Later, the garrison and self-defense forces in the area worked together to resist, and the landing Japanese soldiers fled back to the ship in their original boat. The three ships have already sailed away. Sanmen Bay is one of the important ports in eastern Zhejiang. After the war, all ships were prohibited from entering, and the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters sent

Heavy Troops Stationed

The coastal ports have been fortified by the Ningbo and Taizhou Garrison Commanders, and heavy troops have also been stationed there, with strict precautions. The Yong River, Jiao River, Ou River, Ao River, etc. have all been blocked, but the Yong River and Ou River are

To Maintain Navigation

Ships are still allowed to enter the blockade line. The coastal bandits have been gradually wiped out after being rounded up. However, Japanese planes are often discovered in various parts of eastern Zhejiang, and Japanese warships patrol the sea from time to time. Because of the strict precautions taken by the garrison, the Japanese side's attempts to land will definitely be difficult to achieve. All places are still as peaceful as usual. The population of Haimen and other places has been evacuated.

### Japan's Destruction of North China's Finances: A Direct Retaliation is Warranted

Legal Tender is also Considered Foreign Property; Destroying the Puppet Currency is Not Difficult

Japan Disregards the Repercussions of Anglo-American Protests

Continental Press reports that the nominal abolition of Chinese legal tender and the partial control of export foreign exchange have been in effect in North China for a week. According to all news coming from North China, these measures have met with the same results as developments of a similar nature in the past. Regarding currency, the prohibition of legal tender has

Clearly Failed

Because not only has the legal tender not depreciated or disappeared from the market, but the premium for exchanging it for the puppet currency of Peiping continued to increase this week. In other respects, this new method of attacking Western commerce in North China has been temporarily successful. European and American export trade in the ports of the Bohai Sea and Qingdao has temporarily come to a standstill. The Japanese and puppet authorities even forbid Western commercial firms from fulfilling previously agreed upon commercial agreements in violation of the new control system. According to a Reuters dispatch from Tianjin, it is clear that this new economic measure in North China is backed by the Japanese army. Japanese soldiers search Chinese and foreigners at the entrance of the former German concession for anyone carrying legal tender. This act is a barbaric military

Rude Action

And completely violates the treaty rights enjoyed by Westerners. Consular jurisdiction should protect foreign property not only legally but also in fact, regardless of Japan's wishes. Chinese legal tender is also considered foreign property. Many Western merchants in China deeply regret that their national authorities have not confronted the Japanese army in North China. Most of them want to know what would happen if Western troops protected the loading of export goods on foreign ships outside of Dagu, and foreign gunboats escorted them, disregarding the orders of the Peiping puppet government. Of course, the whole matter is not yet over. The British House of Commons has issued sharp words on the matter, and, together with the United States, has lodged a

Formal Protest

With the Tokyo government. According to Japanese newspapers, the Japanese side will not pay attention to these protests. However, Western civilized nations will not remain silent when they see their protests rejected, and they will likely take some kind of retaliation. However, it is generally hoped that retaliation will not be directed at North China itself, because this would harm the foreign interests in the area and might be indirectly manipulated by the Japanese side. Therefore, retaliation must be directed directly at Japan. The new measures in North China are being implemented by the Japanese side, and Western countries must make the Japanese feel that these measures are

Rash and Reckless

Only then will it stop. Whether the Japanese-puppet economic and monetary legislation in North China will succeed or not depends not only on the attitude of Western countries, but mostly on the Chinese people. The Chinese people in the cities of North China controlled by the Japanese army do not use direct methods of force, but continue to resist passively through non-cooperation, gradually rendering the Japanese efforts ineffective. If the Chinese people cooperate, then the exchange of legal tender for puppet currency today will not succeed. If the Chinese people continue to be united and resolute, then the special institutions of the Chinese banking industry and its numerous exchange shops can be used to

Continue to Destroy

The puppet currency of Peiping. A friend who has just returned to Shanghai from North China repeatedly urged reporters to pay attention to the price issue. He solemnly stated that the Japanese side has obviously ignored the seriousness of the price equalization issue in promoting the implementation of the new currency measures. It must be known that the price of one shilling and two pence for one yuan of puppet currency must be greatly reduced before it is feasible. In other words, the exchange rate for foreign currency quoted by the Peiping puppet bank is currently about 60% higher than it should be. The Japanese hope to be able to reduce the price equalization, but there is no sign of price reduction, and it is continuing to rise. Even in Peiping itself, the puppet authorities have established numerous regulations on official prices, but

Unable to Stop

The continued rise in prices. Earlier this week, the price of Saigon rice in Peiping jumped to an average of 25.5 yuan per bag. The price of North China's export products has also increased in proportion to the increase in the amount of puppet currency in circulation. The price of various imported goods has also increased, because the new currency measures have created new obstacles to imports and made the shortage of imported goods even worse. The Peiping puppet bank announced that it would sell foreign exchange to pay for imported goods, but no foreign merchant has purchased foreign exchange from it for private transactions. The puppet bank also established a so-called list of imported goods with priority rights, first supplying foreign exchange for the goods on the list, and then handling foreign exchange for other goods. The list includes Japanese military supplies

Accounted for the Majority

Under these circumstances, the first week after the implementation of the new measures in North China was not encouraging. This move failed to solve the major economic and financial problems, but instead made these problems more unstable than before.

Bountiful Bamboo Shoot Supply in the Market

This year, the bamboo shoot market in this city has been quite expensive due to the scarcity of supply. In the past ten days, the weather has turned warmer, and the goods have been crowded, and the market has seen a price drop. Currently, the selling price of bamboo shoots is ten to eleven yuan per hundred market catties, and mao bamboo shoots are seven yuan. In the future, the market will change with the changes in the weather.

### Joint Performance by Changzhou and Wuxi Opera Troupes for Fundraising

Broadcasting to Raise Funds for Education and Upbringing; Youth Association Holds Children's Competition

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Hometown Group is sparing no effort in its work to relieve refugees. The Changzhou and Wuxi Hometown Associations of this group, in view of the large number of refugees in Shanghai and the vast amount of supplies needed, have specially organized a joint performance of seven Changzhou and Wuxi opera troupes. After repeated efforts, they have invited famous actors from various troupes to rehearse and perform improved, wonderful, and high-minded famous plays. The actors have enthusiastically participated, using entertainment for charitable purposes and art performances to relieve refugees. It is scheduled to be performed at the Hushe Theater for three days from April 7th to 9th. Tickets are priced at one yuan and one yuan each. It is hoped that enthusiastic philanthropists from all walks of life will participate in this good cause. Ticket sales for the Changzhou and Wuxi Opera Troupes Joint Performance Art Show are located at No. 6, Lane 102, Middle Section of Tongfu Road, Changzhou Hometown Association, telephone number 34128.

Broadcasting to Raise Funds Declares Opening

The Shanghai First Special Municipal Joint Association's Refugee Relief Committee held a broadcasting ceremony to raise funds for the Women and Children's Education and Upbringing Institute yesterday at noon. Zhou Bangjun and Tao Leqin delivered opening speeches. Zhang Yichen, Liu Zhongying, Song Shixiang, and others reported on the significance of educating and raising women and children. All sectors of society cared for the distressed women and children and donated money for their adoption, which was quite enthusiastic. The association's broadcasting dates are until the 21st, for a total of four days. During the broadcasting period, in addition to the unanimous mobilization of all members of the Art Performance Broadcasting Committee, the committee's director Zhang Ye'er and others will be responsible for reporting. Zhou Bangjun's opening speech briefly stated that the association is holding a fundraising event for the Women and Children's Education and Upbringing Institute at the Washington Radio Station today. He would like to first talk about the purpose of the Women and Children's Education and Upbringing Institute. Relief work in Shanghai has been carried out for nearly 20 months, but it still focuses on the passive aspects, which is unavoidable because there are too many refugees, and it is already very difficult to raise supplies. It is difficult to fully organize the active work of educating and raising refugees for production. Recently, the Refugee Association has been stepping up planning for the resettlement of refugees, striving to make young and strong people engage in production and support themselves, and the elderly, weak, women, and children will also be educated. The association's Women and Children's Education and Upbringing Institute will pay special attention to education and vocational training, so that refugees can avoid laziness and prepare themselves for independence in the future. It is hoped that all sectors of society will support it and jointly promote its success.

Efforts to Promote Piggy Bank Movement

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Township Organization Solicitation Committee, in order to launch a piggy bank relief movement, resolved to organize a Piggy Bank Promotion Movement Committee, and appointed Chen Jicheng and fifteen others as committee members. The first resolution meeting is scheduled to be held this afternoon (19th) to discuss the implementation methods.

Youth Association Holds Children's Competition

The Shanghai Youth Association has always been dedicated to serving the society, and has made many contributions. In the past year, it has been particularly effective in relieving refugees. Recently, the association has considered the education of children in shelters, in order to develop their talents, and promote the four educations of morality, intelligence, physique, and community for children. In order to arouse the attention of people in the society, it plans to hold a four-education competition for children. Detailed methods are being planned and will be held in the association's building early next month.

### This Year's Tea Loan: 20 Million Yuan

Provinces Establish Tea Management Offices; New Tea Picking Begins During Qingming Festival

Tea is a unique product of China. After the government encouraged production and the Trade Commission implemented controls, exports after the war have increased. This year's new tea picking will begin during the Qingming Festival. The commission will work with various provinces to handle this year's loan of 20 million yuan, and will establish management offices in the tea-producing provinces. The details are as follows:

Encouraging Production and Compiling Exports

Anhui, Zhejiang, Hunan, and other provinces are the largest tea-producing areas in China. The production is mainly exported to Russia, the United States, and the United Kingdom. After the war, the Trade Commission implemented controls, concentrating exports through Hong Kong. Last year's production did not decrease due to the war. On the contrary, due to government encouragement and assistance, and the enthusiastic lending of the silver and money industries, tea production increased. All of them were purchased by the China Tea Industry Company and the Fuhua Company and various foreign tea houses. The Trade Commission assessed the prices and implemented them, which was quite effective. Last year's exports totaled 416,246 quintals, worth 33,054,085 yuan in national currency, an increase of 3 million yuan compared to the 25th and 26th years.

This Upper Year Loan of 20 Million

In order to increase production, the Trade Commission has promoted tea planting in various border provinces, and has worked with the governments of Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Hunan provinces to handle joint venture loans. The total amount is determined to be 20 million yuan in national currency. The Trade Commission assumes 80%, and the rest is assumed by the provincial governments. It is designated as a loan for the 28th year, and tea management offices are established in the tea-producing provinces, responsible for registering tea shops and tea factories, guiding tea farmers, improving quality, and increasing production. As for this year's new tea, which will begin to be picked around the Qingming Festival, it will all be purchased by the government, concentrated in Hong Kong, and then shipped out. Various foreign tea houses in Shanghai have established offices in the production areas to prepare for purchase.

### Shanghai Refugee Relief Association (Continued) (Yesterday) Management Policy of Shelters

All of us who have come to participate in the relief work of the association should take the relief of refugees and service to the society as our purpose. As long as it is beneficial to the refugees and the society, we will not hesitate to sacrifice personal happiness. As far as I know, many of you present have done great things, but recently I have found that a few colleagues feel the bitterness of life because the association was just founded, and all the organizations and equipment have not been fully realized, and even their work is not as hard as when they first came. Since Ren Bao took over as the head of the shelter, he has insisted on using talent as the most important thing for the staff, and never uses private individuals, so most of the staff have been recruited. Before being assigned to a position, everyone has an individual talk, the most important of which is to tell them that the service of the association must be able to endure hardship and work hard, and everyone has expressed that they will serve the refugees as their purpose, and are willing to endure hardship and work hard. I also told them that the association's treatment is meager, and everyone's answer is that they will serve the public and will never care about the amount of salary. Even if someone is introduced to the association and submitted to me by the secretariat for screening, they will never be hired casually because of the relationship of the introduction, and they must also pass a considerable assessment and hire them according to their talents. There is no omission in the above talks, and everyone must find a guarantor and fill in a guarantee form. The guarantee form also clearly states that "if there is any misconduct, embezzlement of public funds, borrowing money in the name of..., bribery, or private acquisition of public property, manipulation of the hands, deduction of relief grain, injury to refugees, violation of office rules, and all kinds of illegal acts, etc.," the guarantor must be fully responsible. The guarantor is so heavily responsible, how can the colleagues not be vigilant at all times? (To be continued)

### Adulterer and Adulteress Murder the Husband

Taking Advantage of the Husband's Sleep, They Chopped Him to Death with an Ax and Moved the Body, Which Disappeared Without a Trace. The Case Was Only Solved a Few Days Ago. The Adulterer Was Arrested and Awaiting Capture, and the Adulteress Was Under Investigation.

Dou Youqing (24 years old, road worker), a native of Funing living in a bungalow on Hangzhou Road, Yangshupu, recently married a fellow villager named Zhang Er Guniang as his wife. The couple's relationship was not harmonious, and they often quarreled. At about 1:00 AM on the 21st of last month (that is, the Lunar New Year's Day), he was chopped to death with an ax and the body was moved, disappearing without a trace. His wife, Zhang Er Guniang, falsely claimed to her neighbors and her own biological mother, Zhang Zhou Shi, that her husband, Dou Youqing, was sipping tea at a nearby tea house and was taken away by someone to work.

He Never Returned Home. The neighbors believed it to be true and did not ask. She then took the opportunity to move her family to Yaoshui Lane, Roberts Road. The case was only solved by Yangshupu Police Station Chinese Detectives Zhang Guanying, Jin Wanrong, Ji Xiucheng, and others at about 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. At that time, they were passing by the intersection of Hangzhou Road and Lan Road and saw a group of children surrounding a pond. The detectives went forward to investigate and saw a rotten male corpse

Floating on the Water. A rope was tied around his waist. The police immediately tried to pull the corpse up, and at the end of the rope was a lead bucket filled with pebbles. The face of the corpse, with an ax mark, was very deep on the left cheek. The corpse was sent to the police hospital, where a doctor examined it and found that the injuries to the neck and left cheek of the corpse were quite severe. They were transferred to the Jiaozhou Road corpse examination center, waiting for the court to send officials to examine the corpse. At that time, a passerby, Xu Faxi, and a woman, Li Jiang Shi, recognized the corpse as their former neighbor, Dou Youqing, and went to report to his mother-in-law, Zhang Zhou Shi, at No. 8, Taishun Lane, Pingliang Road. She was unaware of

The Inside Story, her son-in-law was actually killed by her daughter, Zhang Er Guniang, and her lover, a fellow villager, Pang Kaibao (22 years old), together with an ax. Therefore, after learning about it, she rushed to Roberts Road to find her daughter, but had already fled after hearing the news. Afterwards, Chinese detectives arrested the murderer Pang Kaibao, took him into the police station for detention, and yesterday sent him to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, filed a public prosecution for murder under Article 271, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, and said that the investigation in this case revealed that

The Deceased's Wife, Zhang Er Guniang, had been in a relationship with the defendant for some time. The first time she wanted to kill her with an ax was on New Year's Eve of the Lunar New Year last year. Because Dou was sleeping peacefully in bed at the time, he suddenly woke up and failed to start. The second time was late this night, when Zhang Er Guniang stole a firewood ax from her neighbor, Li Jiang Shi, and handed it to the defendant. He chopped her husband to death with an ax while he was asleep, and then moved the body and threw it into Hangzhou Road (a pond dug by someone to build a house and filled with water to this day). In this case,

Zhang Er Guniang is at large, please postpone it, etc. Then the Chinese and Western detectives stated the process of solving the case, and presented the rope and the lead bucket for inspection. According to the deceased's mother-in-law, Zhang Zhou Shi, her daughter and the defendant conspired to kill her son-in-law, Dou Youqing, and she did not know, please appreciate. According to Li Jiang Shi's proof, the ax presented in the case was indeed stolen from her home, etc. Judge Huang Risheng questioned the defendant and ordered him to remain in custody and reschedule the hearing.

### Passengers Drown at Sea on the Tangsai Ship Bound for Ningbo; Two Suicide Notes Have Been Sent to Family Members

The Tangsai ship left Shanghai for Ningbo on the 14th. In the middle of the journey, a passenger jumped into the sea and committed suicide. The ship has now returned to Shanghai. The details are recorded as follows:

Drowning at Sea in the Deep Night. The Tangsai ship departed from Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 14th for Ningbo. In the third-class cabin of the ship, a middle-aged passenger suddenly jumped into the sea and committed suicide when the ship arrived in the waters of Daji Mountain. Although the ship was stopped to search for the body, it was too late. Afterwards, two suicide notes were found by the tea room on the passenger's bunk. It was then learned that the deceased's name was Han Zongyu, 25 years old. His boat insurance policy was guaranteed by Huifeng Tea House at No. 151, Beile Road.

Two Suicide Notes. The two suicide notes, one to his sister and one to his brother. Here is his letter to his sister: "Dear sister Zhuang Ci, I haven't seen you for days, I miss you very much. Your little brother has left Shen and left the world. Alas, heaven does not allow people, there is nowhere to live. I wish you good health and a happy family. I believe you have received the previous letter with a photo attached. Your little brother has been buried in the belly of a fish, don't be sad, please take care of everything. Please take care of my mother at home and comfort her. People live for a hundred years, it is a death, see you in the next life. I wish you good health and longevity, your little brother Han Zongyu, on the ship on the evening of March 14th." The above suicide note has been sent by the ship's tea room to He Xiuzhen at No. 99, Hengkang Lane, Aiduya Road.

### Young Woman Forced into Prostitution Sues to Escape the Fire Pit

For the sake of future happiness, she is determined to extricate herself and accuses Hua Linmei of obscenity.

Wang Lili, a woman from Xiangshan, Zhejiang, is now 21 years old. Recently, she hired lawyer Yin Tinghua to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court, accusing Hua Linmei, who lives at No. 2, Yuancheng Lane, Pingjili Road, Lafayette Road, of obscenity and other crimes. Her lawsuit briefly stated that since the plaintiff's parents died early, she was taken to Shanghai by someone in the 25th year of the Republic of China to live with the defendant. Who knew that the defendant would force the plaintiff to work as a prostitute, ordering an old woman to lead her to various hotels such as China, Dadong, Yipinxin, and Dongya, and various amusement parks such as Wing On, to be ravaged by men. Since October of last year, she was forced to enter the Qingyi Guidance Agency. For several years, the income from her nightly fees and guidance fees has been received by the defendant, amounting to a considerable amount. Usually, if she is slightly displeased, she will be privately imprisoned, which is very painful. Recently, she asked the defendant to restore her freedom, and was illegally detained in the attic, until recently, she was able to go out. The investigation shows that the plaintiff has reached adulthood and has the capacity to act according to law. For the sake of future happiness, she is determined to extricate herself, escape the fire pit, and restore all the freedom granted by law. However, the plaintiff has suffered this pain, and her life's happiness has been buried, and the harm is real. The defendant uses the detention of women to engage in adultery with others for profit as a regular business, and obviously commits the crimes of Article 231, Sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law, and should be summoned and tried according to law, etc. This morning, Judge Xiao took the seat in the Second Criminal Court to summon the defendant, Hua Linmei, but she did not arrive. It was ordered to wait for the defendant to arrive and reschedule the hearing.

### Huge Amount of Medicine Stolen on the Kunming Ship

Jin Xinmin, a 25-year-old from Shaoxing, recently colluded with fleeing accomplices Xiao Jiangbei and Xiao Wuxi to steal 3,100 bottles of 606 precious medicinal powder (62 boxes, 50 bottles per box), worth 6,880 yuan, from the cargo hold of the Kunming ship at the Taikoo Wharf on the 19th of last month, and converted it into money for distribution. The Water Police Station has now arrested Jin and recovered one box of the original stolen goods, and transferred it to the French Police Station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Second Special District Court, where lawyer Chen Ming of the French Concession Administrative Authority stated the case and requested a rescheduling of the investigation to arrest the accomplices who were at large and interrogate them. Then the detectives of the Water Police Station reported the circumstances of solving the case. Jin confessed to the theft after being interrogated. Judge Qiu ordered the hearing to be rescheduled to the 22nd and the defendant to be detained.

Yitaixing Coal Shop Robbery Case; Four Thieves Separately Sentenced; Should Also Compensate the Owner for All Losses

Yang Chengcai, a Chinese detective from the Laozha Police Station, previously learned that a gang of thieves was hiding in Room 223 of the Laodongfang Hotel on Zhejiang Road, so he went to arrest the thief Li Jianming (aka Amao) at the address on the 15th of last month. Unexpectedly, Li's accomplices suddenly opened fire and resisted arrest at that time, causing Detective Yang to be injured and Li to escape. Afterwards, Chinese detectives Huang Siming and Yang Fusheng of the Xinzha Police Station arrested Li again at No. 219, Yunnan Road, and confiscated bank passbooks, cash, and clothing. They also successively arrested three accomplices, Chen Baosheng, Huang Xingyang, and Sang Rongxiang. It was found that these people were related to the robbery of 32,000 yuan from Yitaixing Coal at No. 184, Xinzha Road on January 15 of this year. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and brought to justice. Yesterday morning, Judge Fu Lin took the seat in the Second Criminal Court and announced the verdict. Li Jianming was sentenced to 11 years of imprisonment for joining forces to carry weapons and robbing at night, and 3 years of imprisonment for jointly damaging equipment and escaping. The imprisonment was 13 years. Chen Baosheng was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment for robbery. Huang Xingyang was sentenced to 9 years of imprisonment.

The cash that has been handed over to the case and the items obtained by using the stolen goods will be handed over to the original owner by the police station first.

### Two Coal Shop Runners Collude to Embezzle Huge Amount of Coal Money

One Criminal Arrested; One Criminal at Large; Hearing Rescheduled After the Case is Clarified

Lu Yili, a 36-year-old from Changzhou and a runner for Huacheng Coal at No. 33, Sichuan Road, Public Concession, claimed to Wu Jitong, the manager of the shop, on the 4th of this month that the Dachunghua Overshoes Factory needed to purchase 200 tons of Hongji coal dust. Wu asked Lu which coal shop in Shanghai had this coal dust for sale, and asked Lu to find a way. Lu replied that Yuanxiang Coal at No. 10, Gansidong Road, French Concession, still had

Hongji Coal Dust

Stock in stock, which can be purchased to replenish, etc. Wu Jitong sent shop staff Weng Shaoyou and Zheng Changgen, together with Lu Yili, to Yuanxiang Coal to purchase the goods the next day (5th) according to the market price. Weng brought 4,680 yuan in cash, and Lu brought 2,000 yuan in cash, totaling 6,680 yuan. Weng, Lu, and Zheng hired a Yunfei car to go to Yuanxiang Coal on Gansidong Road. After arriving at the destination, they contacted Chen Kangyuan (34-year-old Ningbo native), a runner for Yuanxiang Coal. Weng handed the 4,680 yuan in cash to Lu Yili, who went to

Yuanxiang Coal's

Upstairs to inspect and deliver, with Chen Kangyuan. Weng and Zheng waited downstairs. Later, Chen and Lu went downstairs and handed Weng Shaoyou a bill of lading for 200 tons of Hongji coal dust from the same industry's Tongchang Coal's Pudong Sanjing Coal Stack. On the 7th, Wu Jitong, the manager of Huacheng Coal, sent someone to Pudong Sanjing Coal Stack to pick up the goods but was unable to find them. He went to Lu Yili to negotiate. It was known that Lu had already fled with his wife on this day, and there was no place to find him. He then negotiated with Chen Kangyuan of Yuanxiang Coal. Chen

Flatly Denied

That there was such a transaction. At this point, Wu realized that he had been cheated, and Lu had no place to track down. He then entrusted lawyer Wang Henggu to report to the French Police Station, Chen Kangyuan defrauded him of his property, and requested that he be arrested and investigated. The police chief approved the word and sent detectives to arrest Chen Kangyuan and send him to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu Huanxun continued the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court. Lawyer Yuan Jiahuan of the French Concession Administrative Authority stated the case and filed a lawsuit according to law. The prosecutor Wu Jitong entrusted lawyer Wang to represent the collateral civil suit, seeking to recover

The Cheated Money

6,680 yuan. The defendant Chen Kangyuan still firmly denied that there was such a transaction, and the witnesses Weng Shaoyou and Zheng Changgen testified in court that Lu Yili contacted the defendant to purchase the goods and handed the money to Lu Yili, who went upstairs with the defendant to inspect and deliver, and handed it downstairs, and the defendant handed over the bill of lading of Tongchang. The process was vivid. After the court verified the confession, the case needed to be investigated in detail, and it was announced that the hearing would be rescheduled to the 25th.

### Lawyers Association News

-

The Shanghai Lawyers Association had a total of 1,300 members before the outbreak of the August 13th Incident two years ago. During the tense period of the Shanghai war, most lawyers left Shanghai to work in the rear, and there were not a few of them. With the westward movement of the National Army and the fall of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, a small number also turned into upstarts in the puppet regime. Therefore, at the end of that year, less than half of the lawyers remained in Shanghai. Later, due to the expansion of the war zone, lawyers from various places gathered in Shanghai and successively applied to join the association as members to practice law in Shanghai. By the end of last year, the number had recovered to 1,300. Recently, the association, upon the order of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, has reported the expulsion of lawyers who have been clearly confirmed to have participated in important positions in the puppet organization, and their lawyer qualifications have been revoked. The association is now reprinting the membership directory and has included more than twenty new members who joined this year, such as Huang Zhenqing, Yu Zhewen, Chen Rongfa, Shan Zonglu, Ying Shulin, Chen Xintian, etc., in the new membership directory.

### Yu Zhendong's Residence and City Properties to be Sold at Auction by the Court for Over One Million

No Bids Received; Litigation Arises Over Movable Property

The Western-style house at 43 Gu Bai Road in the French Concession is the residence of Yu Zhendong from Haimen. The city properties and residences nearby are also owned by Yu. Previously, they were mortgaged to the British firm Taylor &amp; Little for one million National currency. Later, they were mortgaged to the Japanese firm Yatani &amp; Co. for 100,000 yuan. Upon maturity without redemption, the Special Second Court ruled that Taylor &amp; Little were the preferred creditor. The execution court auctioned the properties according to law, with a minimum price of 1.47 million yuan, but no one bid. Regarding all the movable property in the house, Shimada Mannosuke, a Japanese merchant, recently hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special Second Court, suing Taylor &amp; Little and Yu Zhendong, requesting confirmation of the mortgage right and opposing Taylor &amp; Little's disposal of the movable property. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Wu Xiaoke in the Seventh Civil Court. Both parties were represented by lawyers who appeared in court. The court noted that both parties intended to reconcile, so after a brief hearing, it was announced that the hearing would be adjourned to March 29th.

Police Department

Spot Check in Central District

Tea Houses and Brothels Not Spared; Over Sixty Arrested

According to the Continental Daily, police officers in the Public Concession conducted operations last night (the 17th) in the old Zhabei district, the commercial center, searching warehouses, tea houses, and brothels in the alleyways.

### Public Works Bureau Rushing to Build Shanhai Pass Road

Xinzha Road to be Repaired

The section of Xinzha Road in the Public Concession from North Chengdu Road westward to McTaggart Road has been damaged, and there are many vehicles, which often causes danger. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau ordered the Xinzha Police Station in charge to prohibit rickshaws from traveling on it. Construction has been underway for more than half a year. Now, except for a small part of the road from Datong Road eastward to Chengdu Road, which is still under construction, the rest has been repaired. Currently, rickshaws, handcarts, and bicycles are allowed to travel eastward from McTaggart Road, but are still not allowed to travel westward from Chengdu Road. Because since rickshaws were banned from Xinzha Road last year, a group of heavy-loaded flatbed carts, "tiger" carts, handcarts, rickshaws, and bicycles, whether from west to east or from east to west, had to detour via Shanhai Pass Road to the south of McTaggart Road and Chengdu Road, and via West Suzhou Road along the river to the north. Therefore, these two roads suddenly became lively. However, heavy-loaded vehicles found West Suzhou Road inconvenient to travel on and had to travel via Shanhai Pass Road. As a result, the road surface there was severely damaged. Although it was repaired from time to time, it was repaired and destroyed immediately due to the large number of vehicles, which was of no help. Recently, the Public Works Bureau specially dispatched a large number of coolies to remove the damaged road surface and carry out major repairs. Moreover, there is a small vegetable market there, and pedestrians are very busy, so construction is being rushed.

### Finance  European Situation Tense  Gold Price Plunge Spreads

Closed at 2066 Yuan

Yesterday, the cash market situation was dim and lifeless, its momentum also weak and sluggish, thus the downward trend gradually expanded. This was mainly because China, benefiting from British aid, established the Exchange Equalization Fund. Consequently, the legal tender base became increasingly solid. Moreover, it was reported that the British Parliament was expected to pass the stabilization of the Chinese legal tender plan within the next week. In addition, the European situation became increasingly tense as German forces encountered resistance from a small number of Czech troops. Therefore, operators generally believed that foreign exchange had the potential for long-term appreciation, leading to extreme anxiety. Jewelry shops sold off in droves, and money changers fiercely competed to unload on behalf of local clients. As a result, the price plummeted, reaching the day's low of 2,066 yuan. However, the price briefly rose mid-day due to purchases by gold firms, but ultimately, demand could not keep up with supply, and it was difficult to sustain the increase. Consequently, the price plunged 18 yuan. Trading volume was thin as Tianjin and Hong Kong traders remained on the sidelines, totaling only 700 taels. Silver jewelry also continued to fall by one yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Plummeted 18 Yuan

In the early morning, sellers initially quoted 2,085-86 yuan per bar (ten taels), while buyers bid 80 yuan, leading to a stalemate until 9:45 am. Trading finally commenced with a cash dealer buying 50 taels from a money changer at 2,082 yuan, 2 yuan lower than the previous day's close. Subsequently, a broker bought another 50 taels at 81 yuan. Although jewelry shops and some money changers tended to sell, the situation remained relatively stable due to strong absorption by gold firms, hovering around 80 yuan. A gold firm bought 100 taels from jewelry shops at 80 and 81 yuan. A broker then bought 50 taels from a money changer at 80 yuan. Jewelry shops traded 50 taels among themselves at 81 yuan. A gold firm bought 50 taels from jewelry shops at 80 yuan. Then, a gold firm bought 50 taels from a money changer, also at 80 yuan. Later, the gold firm bought another 50 taels from a money changer at 78 yuan. After this, the gold firms ceased buying and stepped aside, while sellers became more eager, leading to a sudden weakening and the price breaking through the 70 yuan barrier. Money changers traded 50 taels among themselves at 69 yuan, and soon after, another 50 taels at 67 yuan. Then, a gold firm resumed buying, triggering a rebound. The gold firm bought 50 taels from a money changer at 69 yuan, and later another 50 taels at 75 yuan, which was the noon close price. In the afternoon, demand further weakened, causing the price to fall back into the 70 yuan range. Trading was limited to money changers trading 50 taels among themselves at 2,066 yuan, which was the evening close price. Consequently, the price plunged 18 yuan compared to the previous day (having fallen for two consecutive days, totaling 30 yuan), with a daily range of 16 yuan. The cash firm's selling price for its own brand gold was 2,075 yuan, and the buying price was 2,060 yuan. The current gold spot price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed price, with no trading activity.

Jewelry Gold Reduced by One Yuan

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael initially remained unchanged. However, around 11:07 am, due to the weakening trend of cash gold, it was also reduced by one yuan. Da Tong Heng lowered its price to 210 yuan, while Xin Tong Heng lowered it to 208 yuan, with a buying price of 202 yuan.

Pure Gold Remained Unchanged Yesterday

London, 17th. British pure gold remained unchanged, staying at £7 8s 6d per ounce. Consequently, the Central Bank of China's cash buying price also remained at 1,212.3 yuan. The listed customs gold price also remained unchanged, at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold spot price also remained at 1,207.6 yuan.

Most Foreign Currencies Fell

Yesterday, British pure gold remained unchanged, and British-American exchange rates continued to decline by 0.25. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms continued to actively settle accounts, and banks provided ample supply, stabilizing market prices. Cash gold opened weak, with frequent selling of long positions. Jewelry shops also supplied from time to time. Gold firms and money changers did not absorb the supply smoothly, leading to a sharp plunge at one point. Later, gold firms and money changers took advantage of the low prices to absorb the supply, gradually stabilizing the market. Afternoon trading was sluggish, with long positions continuing to be unloaded and few buyers. Market prices continued to weaken. Tianjin and Hong Kong traders purchased very little this week due to high remittance rates in Tianjin and falling gold prices in Hong Kong, making it difficult to profit. The demand for British and American gold pounds had decreased. However, wealthy individuals purchased a significant amount of British gold notes. Foreign banks also sold American gold notes. Due to the weakness of cash gold, most market prices declined. Canadian dollars rose due to the trend of equalization between the Canadian and American exchange rates. Public Association transactions were rare. Cheng Tai sold 300 yuan of American gold notes to Chang Tai, and Yong Tai sold 200 yuan of American gold notes to Chang Tai. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds fell by 0.35 yuan, British gold notes fell by 0.05 yuan, American gold pounds peaked at 0.20 yuan, American gold notes fell by 0.02 yuan, French franc notes rose by 0.0075 yuan, Annamite piastres fell by 0.01 yuan, Canadian dollars rose by 0.09 yuan, Italian lira rose by 0.005 yuan, German gold notes fell by 0.01 yuan, Australian gold notes fell by 0.10 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.

If they are transported to Central China or South China, it is necessary to first obtain a certificate of exchange sale from the "Foreign Exchange Management Office" established by the so-called "Joint Reserve Bank," otherwise the customs will not release the goods. Therefore, production prices have risen. Raw peanuts have risen by 1.89 yuan compared to the beginning of this month. The Zhongzhuang grade is priced at 12.80 yuan, and 1,600 packages were handled by foreign firms. Large-grain peanuts are priced at 13.80 yuan, with 3,100 packages traded. Fresh fruit has risen by 1.12 yuan. Gaomi raw fruit is priced at 10.56 yuan, and Wangtai raw fruit is priced at 10.20 yuan, with 3,200 packages traded. The import of sugar goods included 1,220 packages shipped from Hong Kong and another 1,570 packages shipped from Shantou to Shanghai.

### Yarn and Cotton  Actual Demand Slightly Moving  Yarn Prices Rise by More Than Ten Yuan

20-Count Yarn Alone Without Honor

The yarn market is calm, with a slightly tightening trend. The South China, Hong Kong, and Shantou traders have slightly increased their demand, resulting in a solid bullish sentiment. As for the eastern Zhejiang region and the Hunan-Jiangxi areas, they are procuring fine yarn and thread for summer use. Therefore, a certain firm in the industry is actively absorbing supply in the market, closing off sales. The market situation is tighter, with even more artificial maneuvering. As a result, the upward trend is unstoppable. However, upon examining actual transactions, they are indeed slightly weak, but trading among peers exceeds customer sales by several times. The inventory of this commodity is quite low, making it easy to stir up waves. Therefore, the 20-count yarn supply is relatively abundant, and the momentum is moderate. The 20-count yarn market was flat in the afternoon, but thread prices continued to rise sharply, with 32-count yarn soaring by more than ten yuan.

Current Yarn Situation: The market opened relatively peaceful in the early morning, but thread prices were more active due to increased inquiries from Zhejiang traders, leading to bullish sentiment. Everyone was holding tight and unwilling to sell, making the market even more bullish. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn remained at 394.5 yuan. However, the price of 32-count thread jumped by ten yuan. The price of fine yarn and thread then rose sharply, pulling up yarn prices. The market remained flat until the close. The yarn market remained plain and unremarkable when it opened in the afternoon, but 32-count thread prices were mutually bid up, due to some procurement from Wenzhou and Hunan. However, factories released several hundred packages of thread during the price surge, resulting in a total transaction volume of 1,289 packages. Prices for 32-count and 42-count yarn soared by 5 to 15 yuan. There was not much change in 20-count yarn. Zhenhua Factory released 50 packages of 16-count Double Dragon yarn at a price of 325 yuan. Shenxin No. 9 Factory released 250 packages of 32-count Double Horse yarn at a price of 550 yuan. Xinyu Factory released 150 packages of 32-count Earth yarn at a price of 540 yuan, all for April delivery. Today, 45 pieces of yarn were shipped to Tianjin and 400 pieces were shipped to Quanzhou. The amounts purchased by each trader are listed on the left: Shantou 310, Hong Kong 130, Inland 45, Ningbo 79, Hunan 55, Yunnan 120, Wenzhou 150, Xiamen 30, Peers 730, Total 1289. The yarn market remains firm because the northern Tianjin region has reported strong demand for textiles recently, boosting the yarn market. The current spot price for 20-count Water Moon yarn is 339 yuan, and it has reached 40 yuan. The current spot price for 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 329 yuan, and it has reached over 30 yuan. It is said that it was bought again at the close.

Application to Import 1,000 Bales of Indian Cotton

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market is exceptionally uncertain. It fell in the early morning due to a telegram from Liverpool. News from Washington indicated that a plan to encourage cotton export subsidies was in progress. It was reported that the Department of Agriculture had recommended that the government immediately release 1 million bales of loan cotton, but the details were difficult to ascertain. According to Congressman Smith, he will strongly oppose the Department of Agriculture's proposal. Yesterday, New York's near-term prices rose by 3 points, and distant-term prices fell by 2 points. Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose by 1 rupee, due to the instability of the European situation and the issue of the release of American loan cotton. There are concerns that Indian cotton may face slight setbacks. Egyptian cotton fell by 3 points. Yesterday's exchange rates did not fluctuate much. Converted to legal tender, cotton prices increased by 0.2 yuan per dan for American cotton and Brazilian cotton, increased by 0.3 yuan for Indian cotton, and remained unchanged for Egyptian cotton.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: Recently, there has been more trading of 10-count and 20-count yarn, so the cotton purchased by various factories is mostly for the raw materials for yarn spinning. Shenxin again imported 1,000 bales of Indian cotton, Bai Luo District yesterday, with the combined factory delivery price being 75.5 yuan. Japanese factories are refraining from placing orders due to the difficulty in securing Indian cotton, so Japanese factories have stopped ordering Indian cotton for many days. Public attention has shifted to American cotton. However, there may be inconveniences in purchasing American cotton if the American loan cotton is not released yet. Yesterday's cotton prices are listed below:

### Tongzhou Cotton Rose to 80 Yuan

The local cotton business is less active. Although the trading volume is small, there are many transactions. Chinese and Japanese factories did not handle a single package because the actual green prices are too high and are rising endlessly. In short, although the inventory in various production areas has not been exhausted, transportation is hindered, and the source is lacking, so market prices are advancing step by step. New high prices are emerging one after another. The current peak price for Tongzhou cotton has reached 80 yuan, up another yuan from the previous day. The price of Fire Machine Mustard cotton remains the same. Tongzhou cotton arriving from northern Jiangsu is only 268 bales. Today, 200 pieces of organic cotton were exported to Ningbo and 70 pieces were exported to Hong Kong. Yesterday, 4,680 pieces of Yao cotton were imported from Ningbo. The current cotton situation is recorded below:

Metals

Tinplate

Selling Offers Increased Sharply

After Tianjin traders and a certain organization received a large quantity of tinplate, standards rose sharply. Although overseas firms have placed quite a few orders, the market has suddenly surged. For example, the price for No. 24 is fixed at £4 8s 6d per box, and the price for No. 26 is fixed at £3 10s per box (both German goods), both up 5 shillings compared to before. These are forward goods, which cannot supply the immediate needs of this port. Therefore, the market atmosphere is increasingly strong. The most recent selling offer for No. 24 is 145 yuan per box, up 5 yuan from before, and the price for No. 26 is 130 yuan per box, also up 4 yuan from before. Sales are very smooth to textile mills, toy factories, and customer traders in this area. It is said that more than a hundred boxes were sold in the past two days. Indian newspapers have also arrived in Shanghai.

Imports and Exports

Tea and Tobacco Leaves Arrived in Shanghai in Large Quantities

Indian Newspapers Also in Shanghai

Yesterday's imports included 120 pieces of tea leaves shipped from Ningbo, 40 pieces of tobacco leaves also from Ningbo, 1,100 tons of tobacco leaves shipped from New York, another 250 pieces from Wenzhou, 485 pieces of fresh eggs from Ningbo, 14,570 pieces of stationery paper from Wenzhou, another 5,800 pieces from Ningbo, and 369 pieces of Indian newspapers from New York.

Seafood

Arrowroot Flour Sells Well

Arrowroot flour inventory is thin, and local merchants' appetite for it is strong, so selling offers have become stronger. Currently, the market price for the Flying Unicorn brand is 16.5 yuan, the 3× brand is 16 yuan, and the Person and Gun brand is 18.4 yuan, with each brand up 0.3 to 0.4 yuan respectively.

### Securities  European Storms

British Far East Stocks Declined Continuously  Domestic Debt Market Also Unsettled

Securities dark market: Yesterday's market situation continued to fluctuate and failed to calm down. Due to the brewing European storms, there was fear of an incident, and people were unsettled. Throughout the day, the most notable was the continuous buying by No. 4, whose background also belonged to large institutions. Tong Kang also continuously absorbed supply. No. 5 sold Class C and E shares and switched to Class A shares, obviously with other plans. On the selling side, there was much inconsistency. In the morning, Yong Kang, Tian Sheng, and Zhong Yi sold. In the afternoon, Le Mao, Yong Kang, and retail investors sold. Buyers also included sporadic numbers like No. 5, No. 42, and Mao Da. Therefore, the market price fluctuated due to the choices of various traders. The market initially weakened and then rose in the morning, ultimately declining again. The market initially fell and then recovered in the afternoon. The market price changed several times a day, demonstrating the anxiety of the people. Consequently, it continued to decline by a small amount of 0.57 yuan, with a chaotic trend that was difficult to grasp. The total transaction volume was approximately 600,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below:

Stock trading included 50 shares of Chinese Electric Power Company, priced at 5.425 yuan. London British Far East companies' stocks had listed market prices on the 17th (Friday). Affected by the development of the European situation, they continued to decline. HSBC Bank's British registered shares continued to fall by £1, priced at £86. Hong Kong registered shares continued to fall by £2, priced at £84. Kaiping Coal Mine shares continued to fall by 3 pence, priced at 18 shillings. The Gulangyu Rubber Company shares continued to fall by 1 shilling and 3 pence, priced at 18 shillings and 9 pence. Only Mercantile Bank shares slightly recovered by 2 shillings and 6 pence, priced at £8 17s 6d. There were no other changes.

London Chinese foreign currency bonds listed market prices on the 17th of this month (Friday): The Sino-French American 5% loan, with printed debt tickets, plummeted by £1.5, priced at £67.5. The Shanghai Railway loan, with printed debt tickets, rose by 0.5 pound, priced at £16.5. All other bonds remained unchanged. The supply and demand for physical goods in London was also sluggish.

Bitter Almonds

Tianjin Restricted Exports Local Prices Continue to Rise

The restriction on bitter almond exports from Tianjin came into effect on the 10th of this month. Therefore, goods shipped out before the 10th are still arriving, resulting in a soaring trend. The price for higher quality goods has been quoted at 70 yuan to 60 yuan. Yesterday, northern goods merchants arrived with more than 50 pieces of slightly inferior goods, but only 30 pieces were offered at 65 yuan, with the remaining merchants insisting on 70 yuan or more before making a further offer.

Grains

Soybean Trading Declined

Yesterday, the soybean sales market was particularly sluggish. Export traders were inactive, and only local merchants showed some interest. The total market trading volume included 20 packages of Pudong Du soybeans, priced at 10 yuan; 200 packages of Chongming sand soybeans, priced at 8.45 yuan; 160 packages of Dalian spot soybeans, priced at 8.43 yuan. Warehouses resold two cars for April delivery, priced at 8.36 yuan and 8.37 yuan. The market price, except for sand soybeans, which fell by 0.05 yuan, experienced slight declines of 0.01 or 0.02 yuan.

Today, 1,340 packages of beans were shipped to Quanzhou.

Coal

White Coal Quietly Declines

High-grade white coal fines have suddenly appeared abundant since the beginning of the year. Currently, another foreign vessel has arrived with 5,000 tons of large shipments of Hongji fines. As factories' demand gradually diminishes, it is difficult to see improvements in trading, resulting in a market situation that is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. However, sales of No. 2 fines are still smooth, as coal ball factories are cheap and easy to sell. The high-resolution goods that were recently sold totaled over 600 tons. The quoted price for No. 1 fines is 28 yuan per ton, No. 2 fines are 22 yuan per ton, and Xin Hong fines are 21.5 yuan per ton. Warehouse delivery, with merchants adding extra.

### Silk and Tea: Unraveling the Reason for the Continued Rise in Japanese Silk Prices

Due to the impact of inflation, Shanghai silk prices have soared, turning it into a sales ground for Japanese silk, which has further led to a prolonged closure of the export silk market.

The Yokohama silk market experienced another surge in prices the day before yesterday. Spot prices opened at 1070 yen, up 35 yen, and forward prices at 1025 yen, up 40 yen, setting unprecedented records. During the first sharp rise in Yokohama silk prices, the Yokohama authorities suppressed speculation and ordered the suspension of auctions. Furthermore, it was rumored that East Market silk prices would be restricted to within 1000 yen by some regulations, which led to a decline in Japanese and American silk prices. However, since the 11th of this month, when Yokohama had fallen to 960 yen, the East Market silk prices have been rising for the past seven days, soaring by 110 yen, almost exceeding the 'regulation' by 200 yen, without any apparent intervention. Therefore, Shanghai silk market understands this price surge as follows: the initial restrictions on Japanese silk prices have been lifted, allowing prices to rise freely, which is attributed to the issue of Japanese currency value. The surge in hoarding and speculation is due to the recent announcement by the Japanese Finance Minister about the decision to implement inflation. This kind of price surge is more valuable within Japan, but in the global market, it still needs to go through exchange rate relations, which will reduce the impact of its sharp rise; this is the first point. Recently, although Yokohama silk prices have risen sharply, the increases in spot prices and near and far-term prices are very uneven, and it is also reported that spot prices are rising while forward prices are falling. This is probably due to the reason for covering shorts when silk prices fell the week before. In addition, New York's spot supply is scarce (silk inventory decreased by 10,000 bales at the end of February), making the need more urgent, and the arrival of raw silk shipments to the United States in March is delayed, creating a situation of scrambling for spot goods; this is the second point. Therefore, this surge can be inferred to be due to fewer supporters from consumers and more due to other special reasons, and there is no significant difference in the nature of this surge from the previous one.

The New York silk market also saw a strong price surge the day before yesterday, with near-term prices up 3.5 cents, far-term prices up 5 cents, spot Japanese silk up 7 cents, and Shanghai and Guangdong silk up 5 cents, still not exceeding the previous highest record (short by about 2 cents). Furthermore, due to the recent lengthening of exchange rates, the combined price of Shanghai silk in the American market is still at 1700 yuan, making it difficult for local port exports to approach.

In this surge of overseas silk prices, the local silk market clearly did not see the enthusiasm of the previous surge. People are hesitant, and there is still little buying or selling. The excessive surge in local silk prices in the previous period, followed by a sudden reversal, has not yet fully recovered from the negative impact. For example, silk factories using rayon instead of real silk has reached 60%, which is a very serious problem. It can be seen that the excessive increase in domestic silk prices (a surge that is divorced from actual sales) not only cut off the domestic sales outlet for raw silk but also objectively opened up a vast market for large quantities of Japanese rayon. This directly damages the foundation of the war of resistance and increases the capital of fascist aggression; this is the first point. Secondly, the prolonged closure of the export silk market has also led to sluggish silk sales and a loss of strong support for silk prices. This not only makes speculators reap the consequences but also leads the entire silk industry onto a path with many pitfalls. All of this is sufficient to confirm the conclusion in the previous article in this publication, "Why Have Silk Prices Surged Excessively Recently?" namely, "Those under the pressure of this surge are still our own people," which is truly regrettable.

At this point, the author would like to raise this question again and sincerely ask the silk industry to learn from the lesson of this excessive rise in silk prices to avoid repeating the same mistakes. (Yang)

Grains

Ke Xian [a type of rice] Production Areas Send Telegrams Prohibiting Long-Distance Transport; Prices Jump Two or Three Jiao

Ke Xian rice has received telegrams from Nanjing and Wuhu, stating that exports are prohibited in those areas, and existing rice cannot be fully loaded. Therefore, the cargo owners are again holding out for higher prices and unwilling to sell cheaply. Prices immediately jumped two or three jiao. Wuhu Xian has risen to 13 yuan, and Nanjing High Xian has reached 13 yuan and 2 jiao, with middle and lower grades following suit.

Foreign Rice Prices are High; People's Sentiment is Also Lifted by the Rise in Local Ke Xian Prices. Currently, Saigon No. 1 foreign rice has risen by one or two jiao, with 300 to 400 bags sold at prices ranging from 17 yuan and 2 jiao to 17 yuan and 1 jiao and a half, and 17 yuan and 1 jiao. The market price is rising, and rice merchants are again focusing on placing orders, but transportation is temporarily difficult. Even the report that Ningbo and Shaoxing have placed orders has not been confirmed.

The source of domestic rice has suddenly become scarce after a certain party in Changshu, Wuxi, and other places prohibited the issuance of transportation permits. Although there are 17th and 18th grade rice arriving at Hexia, only 1000 to 2000 bags are transported by train. Market sentiment has therefore recovered, with most hoarders buying in. The street also followed suit, and sellers took the opportunity to raise prices, resulting in a tight market. As a result, the price of thick and thin粳 rice has risen by one or two jiao, and Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian have also risen by a jiao or so. Bian Yuan has not seen a change because the prices are already high.

Today, 8,500 bags of wheat flour were shipped to Tianjin, 200 bags to Ningbo, 4,400 bags to Fuzhou, and 12,400 bags to Quanzhou.

In addition, 250 bags of wheat were shipped to Ningbo, and 9,000 bags of wheat bran to Quanzhou.

Oil Cakes

Oil Market Turns Steady

More Than 20,000 Pieces of Soybean Cake Shipped to Quanzhou

Yesterday, the oil cake market was peaceful because it was the weekend and there was not much change in the daily quoted prices. Yesterday, it was estimated that 10 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were sold at 31 yuan original price. 100 barrels of Dalian current soybean oil were sold at 32 yuan and 5 fen, and 1 jiao and 5 fen; 50 barrels for delivery in 7 days at 31 yuan and 9 jiao; 100 barrels for delivery in the lower half of March at 31 yuan and 8 jiao and 8 jiao and a half; and 500 barrels for delivery in April at 31 yuan and 8 jiao and 5 fen to 31 yuan and 9 jiao and a half.

Only 5,000 pieces of Dalian soybean cake for May delivery were offered at 3 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen.

Today, 22,750 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Quanzhou, and 1,100 pieces were shipped to Ningbo.

### Piece Goods: Spring and Summer Goods Sales Are Flourishing Daily

White Shirting Flannel Inventory Sold Out; Dong Piece Fine Cloth Dyeing Sales are Strong

Domestic Cloth: Due to the short spring and early hot weather this year, the sales of spring and summer goods in this street and nearby areas have started exceptionally early. Therefore, the demand for spring and summer goods is widespread, and the supply is difficult to meet due to the limited bleaching and dyeing factories. Yesterday, the sales of Southwest Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong merchants gradually improved. In addition to buying bleached and printed goods, 4,000 to 5,000 pieces of raw grey autumn fragrance twill blue cloth were also added. Therefore, the selling price of grey cloth suddenly increased by 1 jiao to 2 jiao and a half. The street is seeing flourishing sales of dark and light-colored cloths, and the price per piece has also increased by about 2 jiao. Although the factory prices of white fine twill coarse cloth are firm, the actual sales performance is mediocre and remains weak. Fine cloth is most popular from the Yongan Factory's Dapeng brand. It is very difficult to find spot goods. Fugui fine cloth has increased by more than 5 fen. Due to weak actual sales, the rebound in the products of various factories is weak. Guangdong merchants purchased more than 100 pieces of Fugui Ai Zi fine cloth and fine twill. Zhejiang and Jiangxi merchants purchased 120 to 130 packages of fine cloth and fine twill from various brands. Spring sales at the street's retail stores are very active. The current goods, such as foreign yarn poplin, bleached cloth, and light-colored cloth, are in high demand. Last year's inventory of white shirting flannel has been sold out. Very few factories produce it. The market price is increasing. Yihua shirting flannel has increased in price to 4 jiao and 5 fen per yard, while the red market was only 3 jiao and 7 fen and a half.

Dong Piece Fine Cloth and Fine Twill: Due to the continued strong dyeing sales in this street, yesterday's spot trade volume reached a huge 1,500 to 1,600 pieces. Market sentiment is soaring, and the price per piece has increased sharply by 1 jiao and a half to 2 jiao. Various foreign firms have also placed orders for more than 1,000 pieces of fine cloth futures for next month. The asking price for fine twill is too high, making it difficult to approach. The April futures price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is 12 yuan and 1 jiao and a half. The price for Wufu Trumpet per piece is 12 yuan and 1 jiao. The opening amount is the largest for Flying Fish fine cloth, totaling more than 700 pieces, with a price ranging from 12 yuan and 2 jiao to 12 yuan and 2 jiao and a half per piece.

Today's piece goods exports: 210 pieces were shipped to Tianjin, 7 pieces to Xiamen, 200 pieces to Quanzhou, and 670 pieces to Ningbo.

Spring and Autumn

### The Life of Female Office Workers

— Hai Xiao

In the current surging wave of unemployment, female office workers in women's professions are indeed a very important occupational sector. In the currently abnormally prosperous Shanghai, although the total number of female office workers has not been accurately counted, a rough estimate suggests that there are at least around 100,000! Most of them work in smaller department stores. However, what the author knows and wants to report on here is still about the larger department stores. Let's first talk about their treatment.

The treatment of female office workers may be imagined by people as being very wealthy. They are hidden in tall skyscrapers, surrounded by luxurious decorations. In the bitterly cold winter, they have the warmth of hot water heating, and in the hot summer, they also have the coolness of air conditioning. Their clothes are also fashionable: they have permed airplane-style loose hair, and they wear high-heeled leather shoes. Indeed, in appearance, everyone thinks that female office workers in large companies are very affluent! Their salaries are quite considerable! But the reality is beyond our expectations, and they have endless grievances to tell!

I once heard a female office worker's complaint: "Eating company food is like sitting in a long-term free prison!" From this complaint, we can already understand their situation.

The daily business hours are usually from 9:00 am to 8:00 pm. Excluding meal times, they spend almost ten hours a day rigidly guarding the "counters" (which may be the prison bars in the eyes of female office workers). Even during idle times, they cannot sneak out for a moment, because customers may visit at any time. If you happen to be away, you must be careful of the supervisor's "scolding," unless you are good at flattering and the supervisor will not forgive you. Therefore, even when you are extremely bored every day, you must stick to your post and can only pace back and forth like a polar bear within the confines of the counter, waiting for customers to arrive. When your legs are sore and tired, you cannot sit on a cold bench for too long, because you must pay more attention to the occasional inspections of the boss and manager.

The busiest time of day is usually around three or four o'clock in the afternoon. When customers swarm in, your hands and brain must be agile, without being flustered or slow. Otherwise, if you miscalculate the money for the day, you must pay for the mistake at the price, which is an undeniable responsibility. If you are a little slow, you may escape the supervisor's "scolding," but the customers' "scolding" may be unavoidable.

Serving customers requires being attentive and considerate, with a welcoming smile on your face; you must be gentle and polite. Only in this way can you attract the customers' money into your hands and then transfer it into the boss's pocket. If you serve customers always stiffly, taking one step for each instruction, answering one question for each question, then frankly speaking, you are not qualified to be an ideal female office worker in the eyes of the boss's business.

Customers who come to the counter do not always make a purchase. Some find the price too expensive and cannot afford it, while others do not buy because of poor service. But there is another type of customer who deliberately does not buy and looks for trouble, which is the most troublesome type of customer for every female office worker. They wear well-tailored Western suits, shiny leather shoes, and glasses, and they walk up as if they are important, asking you to take out this and that. This is not good, and that is not good. Their eyes dart back and forth like mice, and they chatter and harass you for a long time before shamelessly running away. What kind of customers are these? To be honest, they are just the general "Hu Tiao" friends in Shanghai, who are the insults that every female office worker often suffers. In the mouths of these "Hu Tiao" friends, the term "female office worker" has been replaced by something like "vase," which is such an insult! How malicious!

However, in the minds of the general young customers, the service of female office workers seems to be more favorable than that of male office workers, and the attraction is greater. Therefore, female office workers have unconsciously become a type of advertisement utilized by general clever businessmen. (To be continued tomorrow)

### Opening Chapter of National Heroes

— Sun Choucheng

A certain elder, the former director of the Wu County Library, seeing that after the fall of his hometown, a portion of the people had been anesthetized and recognized the invaders as their fathers, willing to be puppets, narrated the stories of national heroes from the past and composed an opening chapter, asking ballad singers to broadcast it through stringed instruments so that the audience would know whom to admire. The words are earnest and sincere, and worthy of promotion. The narratives are generally in vernacular Chinese, so they can be widely disseminated. Two excerpts are recorded below, which patriotic compatriots will also be happy to hear.

(1) Shi Kefa

Mr. Shi Kefa was from Xiangfu County, Henan Province. His courtesy name was Xianzhi, and he was also called Daolin. He was a Jinshi during the Chongzhen reign of the Ming Dynasty, and his official position reached Minister of War. After Li Zicheng invaded Beijing and Emperor Chongzhen hanged himself on Coal Hill, Mr. Shi fainted several times in grief. He then raised troops and crossed the river to prepare to resist the Manchus. Ma Shiying, Ruan Dacheng, and others used force to support Prince Fu and resented Mr. Shi's loyalty and integrity. They appointed him as Grand Guardian of the Heir Apparent and Minister of War, and sent him to Yangzhou to supervise the army, serving as the commander-in-chief of Huaibei, Sishui, Linhuai, and Luzhou, to restrain him. Dorgon, the regent of the Manchu Qing, wrote a letter persuading him to surrender. Mr. Shi replied, refusing. Later, the Qing army besieged Yangzhou. After five days, the city of Yangzhou fell. Mr. Shi was captured and refused to submit, so he was killed by the Qing soldiers. The Manchus hated Mr. Shi and hated the people of Yangzhou, so they sent troops to slaughter them for ten days. After the city of Nanjing fell and Prince Fu fled, the people of Yangzhou commemorated Mr. Shi and buried his clothes and hat on Meihualing outside the Tianning Temple gate. Don't you think Mr. Shi is very admirable?

Ten thousand cold plums bloom with blood, Commander Shi, the pillar of the Central Plains, a great general. Look at the record of the ten-day massacre, a terrible disaster for Yangzhou. In those years, after Emperor Chongzhen ascended the throne, a group of courtiers were mediocre. There were many corrupt officials. It has always been said that military officials want their lives, and civil officials want money. Once the rebel Li Zicheng raised troops, capturing the capital, it was indeed dangerous. The soldiers were exhausted and the pay was cut off, and no one cared whether the Jingyang Palace was hit several times. Alas, Emperor Sizong hanged himself on Coal Hill, the earth shattered and the sky collapsed. Minister Shi heard the news and cried loudly, and the loyal army crossed the river to rescue the emperor. National heroes rose up together, the sound of war drums like thunder. How hateful, Ma Shiying, Ruan Dacheng, and a group of traitors fought for power, supporting Prince Fu and brewing disaster. And Wu Sangui borrowed Qing troops, a great traitor who opened the door to invite the enemy. Causing him, the heroes had no place to use their strength, and Shi Kefa was surrounded. The Ming Dynasty's empire disappeared. So many loyal ministers and righteous people sacrificed themselves. To this day, on Meihualing, his spirit and soul are buried forever, lingering outside Tianning gate.

### "On the Usefulness of Scholars"

— Ge'er

"Scholars are useless," the "uselessness" of cultural people is not just now. "Life begins with recognizing characters confused," therefore, "characters" cannot be truly "recognized," which is a clear annotation to "scholars are useless." Everyone knows that "confused" people are "useless."

Now is the time of the War of Resistance, "abandoning the pen and joining the army" is admired by everyone, which is another clear proof that the "pen" is ultimately inferior to the "gun." Therefore, some people, looking at the cultural people who are making grand pronouncements in newspapers and magazines, cannot help but despise them and say, "If you have the guts, go to the front line, staying in the rear and nagging is verbal resistance, this is the depravity of cultural people!" Therefore, "scholars" are still "useless," but the tone has changed.

However, are "scholars" really "useless"? I say "yes" and "no." Isn't this a contradiction? In fact, everything in the world is contradictory. There is a "good" side, and there must be a "bad" side. Some "scholars" are "useless," but it cannot be denied that some are also "useful." Otherwise, why did Mr. Lu Xun, who was studying to be a doctor, abandon medicine and engage in literary work? Just with a copy of Chernyshevsky's novel "What Is to Be Done?" in my hand, it is said to be an "apocalypse" for young men and women in 19th-century Old Russia. This is only in the literary aspect, and the same is true for social sciences.

Picking out the uselessness of cultural people, despising the "pen" and valuing the "gun," such people can be said to have only one eye and only see one side of everything in the world, and there is a real need for correction.

In fact, some cultural people are indeed "useless." What they write under their pen is not only not beneficial to the country and society, but is actually harmful, which can be said to be beyond "useless." There is also a kind of "bookworm" who holds books and reads to death, nitpicking and pedantic, displaying a complete "scholarly air." The phrase "life begins with recognizing characters confused" is perfect for them. Because such people only see the "dogma" on the books and do not see the turbulent world outside the books. Using "dogma" to measure the turbulent world, their eyes are blurred, and they feel a bit "confused." If a pedantic old man uses Confucius and Mencius's doctrines to evaluate modern women, he will definitely be "confused" and will definitely "begin to worry," shaking his head and sighing, "The world is going downhill."

Such "cultural people" can be said to be "useless." And in the War of Resistance, I don't think there is any need to seek any help from them. However, this is only the "bad" side, and to erase the combativeness of all cultural people from this "bad" side is either "ignorance" or "malice."

The Guilin telegram of the 15th of this month said that General Bai Chongxi, the director of the Southwest Military Headquarters, hosted cultural figures on the 10th and gave a speech, stating that "this war against Japan is a war of resistance and a war of response. We are in a semi-colonial position, and the way to win depends on total war in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture, fighting against the enemy. The work of cultural people, although biased in the rear, is no less helpful to the War of Resistance than the heroic soldiers shedding blood on the front lines." The "usefulness" of cultural people can be said to be a clear proof from General Bai. General Bai also pointed out that in the second phase of the War of Resistance, our side takes a defensive stance in military affairs and an offensive stance in political affairs. Therefore, this shows that the pen of cultural people can be said to be the most excellent weapon in strengthening the spirit of the people.

We will not be "useless" "scholars," nor will we be "confused" by recognizing characters. We will not listen to other people's "nonsense." We will shoulder our "pens" and unleash our fighting spirit. In short, we are "cultural people" who are no less than the heroic soldiers shedding blood on the front lines!

### Thoughts on "The Honolulu Murder Case"

— Li Zhihua

Produced by 20th Century Fox, playing at the Grand Light Cinema

After Warner Oland passed away, the so-called "Chinese detective Charlie Chan" also had two versions. One is our "domestic product," Mr. Xu Shengyuan, and Mr. Xu Xinfu's "The Pearl Shirt" was promoted with "Charlie Chan's First Major Murder Case in China"; the other is Mr. Sidney Toler, whom 20th Century Fox specially sought out as Warner Oland's "successor." These two gentlemen have different nationalities and appearances, but their makeup is consistent, based on Warner Oland, as if Warner Oland was the real "Chinese detective Charlie Chan."

We have seen Xu Shengyuan's Charlie Chan, so let's not mention it. How about that Mr. Sidney Toler? Is his style, like his makeup, inheriting Warner Oland's consistent style?

The answer is: yes, but also no. What does this mean? Yes, he tries very hard to learn Warner Oland's slow, deliberate movements and pronunciation (is this a characteristic of Chinese people? Wrong!). No, because he is ultimately not Warner Oland, so all movements and pronunciation are faster than Warner Oland, but he also loses Oland's depth. From the perspective of our own Chinese people, he seems even less like Charlie Chan.

"The Honolulu Murder Case" begins with a family reunion at Charlie Chan's home, starting with the imminent birth of his eldest daughter, and ending with the birth of his eldest daughter's son, with a "murder case" inserted in between. The Charlie Chan detective series, based on its title and cast, was originally destined to be a "continuous good show." Now that we have been introduced to his sons, daughters, wife, and sons-in-law, and with his personal affairs as the beginning and end, it seems that there is a trend towards writing a biography of Charlie Chan. Naturally, this is based on a "business perspective." If there is business, then "Little Charlie Chan's birth" may not be impossible to turn into a script, because in "The Honolulu Murder Case," there are already two sons with their father's aspirations.

The background of "The Honolulu Murder Case" is on a ship, so the characteristics of Honolulu, where the murder occurred, are absent. In addition to the "detective" as the backbone of the whole play, there are some elements of horror and grotesqueness interspersed, such as Dr. Cardigan, who studies human brains, the wild beast locked in a cage, and the lion-taming crew.

The scriptwriting and directing techniques are not particularly strong. There are some red herrings in the detective film (such as the somewhat grotesque Dr. Cardigan, but based on the experience of watching many detective films, we know that the more suspicious a character is, the less likely they are to be the killer, so our interest in Cardigan decreases). However, there are no clues to solve the case, waiting for a hidden camera to take photos, and then Charlie Chan explains it, which is not enough.

Sun Yong, who plays Charlie's son Jamie, has no other tricks besides flicking his eyes. His face is terrifying, which is contrary to the style of his father, Mr. Charlie; on the other hand, Charlie's fifth son, although small, seems more natural in his performance.

### Rain After the Storm

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Six: Praising a Prodigy, One Seed Bears Three Blossoms; Narrating Friendship, Two Scholars Meet Among Heroes

He Shuangyu asked, "Are those three children still here?" Zhu Airen replied, "Of course they are. We're giving them special care. When they were born, although they were a little smaller than other babies, they still weighed between five and a half and five and three-quarters pounds. It's really amazing how their mother's belly could hold them all. After these triplets were born, as soon as it was published in the newspaper, many people were stirred up and wanted to come and see them. Later, we politely declined everyone, not allowing anyone to visit. Imagine how troublesome it would be if people were coming to visit all day long, and it wouldn't be good for the babies either. Actually, there's nothing much to see. It's just that normally, one person gives birth to one child, but this time she gave birth to three. These three are just like ordinary people, they don't have extra hands or legs. But people are always curious. Some who know Doctor Zhang Yi or know me have asked to see the children. Under the condition that it doesn't bother them, we have to lead people to see them, so they've received quite a few gifts!" He Liyu said, "Don't say people are curious, I want to go see them too. Where are the three children now? When were they born? How old are they now?" Zhu Airen said, "When they were first born, they were originally in our hospital. After they turned one month old, the mother and children were supposed to go home. But Officer Fang's wife's health wasn't very good after the birth. How could she manage to raise three children on her own? It's not just about breastfeeding them, even just looking after them would be very tiring. And their family doesn't have the extra resources to hire wet nurses and caregivers. At this time, the local community thought that triplets were an unusual occurrence, so the village self-government association was willing to subsidize the cost of raising them every year. Our old Doctor Zhang also believed that these triplets were born in our hospital, and that our hospital's nursing care was excellent, ensuring the safety of both mother and children, which is an honor for our hospital. If Officer Fang and his wife were willing to entrust the children to our hospital for care, it would be good because we have an infant care center here, and we would be willing to fulfill our duty. Later, it was decided that the village self-government association would subsidize half of the cost, and our infant care center would fulfill half of the duty. Now, the three children are already eighteen months old. They can walk and talk, they're very lively and cute, and everyone who sees them likes them. Their parents come to see them once or twice a month. At first, they felt like their own children were now being raised publicly, as if the children didn't belong to them. Later, our Doctor Zhang guided them, saying, 'The children are still your children. We're just helping you raise them to save you trouble.'" (64)

The Entertainment World

### A Record of an Interview with Wang Xianzai, an Artist Who Fled with the Long March in Sichuan and Yunnan, Upon His Return to Shanghai

— Xin Shi

Mr. Wang Xianzai, the leader of the "Shanghai Film Actors Troupe," who engaged in drama propaganda work during the Long March into Sichuan the year before last, has recently returned safely north to the isolated island after enduring hardship and experiencing a year and a half of exile in Chengdu, Chongqing, Yunnan, and Guizhou. The day before yesterday, I shook hands with him, exchanged news of our separation, and rejoiced that we were both unharmed. I couldn't help but feel a sense of detachment from the world. Mr. Wang has been famous in the film industry for nearly twenty years. He is a veteran villain, whose image has been deeply engraved in the minds of every audience, and he is known for his superb acting skills. The details of his journey are naturally of concern to every moviegoer. We had previously described the troupe's journey in an article titled "Sun Min Returns from Kunming" a month ago, so this interview will only cover some of Mr. Wang's thoughts and other related topics.

Playing the Villain Causes Disadvantages Everywhere

After the "Shanghai Film Actors Troupe" arrived in Chongqing in October of the year before last, almost all of the troupe's external affairs were handled by him alone. Because in Sichuan, the films of the Mingxing Film Company have always been the most popular; only he and Gong Jianong are the well-known veteran actors; others such as Ms. Bai Yang and other newcomers are generally unfamiliar to the locals. Therefore, for the sake of convenience, he could only take on the title of leader and do more work. But because he often plays villains on the screen, the people of Sichuan really regarded him as an "unpardonable" treacherous figure, which sometimes made them wary of him, hindering his actions and making things difficult. In a state of both anger and amusement, he himself believed that he was getting his just deserts for playing so many evil roles on the screen. Therefore, he suffered a lot in his work, which was a great joke.

Disagreements Arise, Troupe Splits

When the large group of film actors first set out on their expedition to Sichuan, everyone had a passion, intending only to fulfill their duties, and no one had any desire for fame or fortune. Therefore, everyone in the troupe, from the leading actors to the laborers, shared the hardships and enjoyed the rewards together, and there was no distinction in treatment. Everyone's initial desire was only to maintain a minimum standard of living. Later, the performances were surprisingly successful, and after deducting all expenses, the troupe even had a surplus of more than one hundred yuan per month, which was a pleasant surprise and made them even more excited. But after finishing the performances in Chongqing and moving on to Chengdu, the performance of the patriotic play "Thirty Million Refugees" went beyond the ordinary and caused misunderstandings with the local authorities, leading to a great deal of trouble. After that, disagreements arose within the troupe, and it split into two organizations. Bai Yang, Shen Fu, and more than twenty others reorganized into the "Chengdu Troupe." Wang Xianzai, Sun Min, Gong Jianong, Ma Shouhong, Yuan Zhuru, Zhu Manhua, and other seven men and women withdrew and formed the "Sullivan Troupe." Both groups continued to perform in Chengdu, gradually deciding to perform more professional dramas. After performing like this for more than two months, and resting there for a long time, this small troupe of seven finally made its way to Kunming in early winter of last year. The "Chengdu Troupe," with the exception of Bai Yang and a few others who immediately joined the Central Film Studio, later merged with the "Amateur Troupe" and gave long-term performances.

Yuan Zhuru Finds a Good Match on the Journey

Ms. Yuan Zhuru, a female troupe member, was originally an old colleague of his at the Mingxing Film Company. During the perilous journey of thousands of miles, they took care of each other along the way, and their feelings grew closer, gradually leading them to fall in love. Miss Yuan is dignified and serene, and a young unmarried woman; he is also an old widower who has been "celibate" for thirteen years. Therefore, their "heaven-made match" resulted in a wedding comedy in Chengdu on January 15 last year. At that time, they held a grand banquet for their guests, and the scene was extremely lively. Miss Yuan's family is from Kunming, Yunnan, and later, after arriving there, she even returned to her hometown with him to sweep her parents' tombs and pay respects, which was considered fulfilling a little of her filial piety. Recently, after the couple returned to Shanghai together, many friends in the film industry celebrated their good fortune and asked them to treat them to wedding wine. They have also prepared to host a banquet at a set time, but in the current environment, they will absolutely not make any extravagant displays.

Thoughts of Home Stirred by Local News in the Entertainment World

From Chengdu, they went to Kunming, where they performed at the New Yunnan Opera House for more than seventy days, performing seven plays including "The Luminous Cup," "Drunk Life, Dream Death," "Thunderstorm," and "Sunrise," and the situation was very good. Originally, after Sun Min and Gong Jianong finished performing there and returned to Shanghai first, they were planning to go to Guiyang again. At that time, Guiyang was bombed by enemy planes on February 4, and the city was affected, so everyone was quite hesitant. Also, they happened to see the article "Sun Min Returns from Kunming" in the "Entertainment World" section of the Shen Bao, and knowing that there were no obstacles to returning to Shanghai, they couldn't help but feel homesick. That's when they decided to travel with Miss Zhu Manhua and two others, taking the route through Haiphong and returning to Shanghai via Hong Kong. According to Mr. Wang, the only Shanghai newspaper available in Kunming was the "Shen Bao," which was very popular; but it always arrived ten days late, which made the travelers anxious and constantly longing for it.

Various Parties Compete for His Services, Future Undecided

Mr. Wang is the only master at playing villain roles on the silver screen. For more than ten years, no one has been able to compete with him, and he still maintains the highest position in this field. In the current situation where monsters and ghosts are rampant, these negative portrayals that expose evil are precisely what he needs to depict on the screen to show the greatest power of leaving nowhere to hide. Regarding his future plans, he is being courted by various parties and is finding it difficult to decide. On the one hand, he was contacted earlier by "Xinhua" and "Mingxing" and doesn't want to refuse them; on the other hand, he feels it would be difficult to break off the long-standing relationship with his old hosts. Therefore, he is hesitant and has not yet been able to make a decision.

### Performers' Activities

The Truth Behind Huang Guiqiu's Suspension of Performances: Since the appearance of the famous Dan Huang Guiqiu on the Tianchan Stage, business has been mediocre. To remedy this, the stage owner, Gu Zhuxuan, specifically reduced seat prices to make them more accessible to the common people and easier to attract audiences. Guiqiu, however, believed that this was detrimental to her reputation because she had not been consulted beforehand. Thus, the other day, she suddenly claimed to be unwell and in need of rest, refusing to perform and moving out of the actors' dormitory at Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, to a friend's place on Aigre Road in the French Concession. After receiving this news, Gu sent Zhang Jianfei and Chang Yunheng with 2,000 yuan in performance fees to Huang's place to negotiate, but they returned without success. That evening, the play "June Snow," which had been scheduled to be performed, was replaced by Kun Dan Xue Youqin. Xue Niang's artistry has long been appreciated by the people of Shanghai, and no accidents occurred. The applause was endless, and she was a great success. It is said that Guiqiu, after suffering such a miserable failure in Shanghai, cried like Ruan Lang, vowing never to perform here again. However, Tianchan is still in negotiations with her, hoping that she will continue to perform after she recovers.

Wang Fuying Reported Back to Work Yesterday: Since leaving the Gongwu Stage and joining Tianchan, the martial artist Wang Fuying has been very popular with audiences. When asked about his future, he replied, "I'll just muddle through wherever I am." Recently, he caught a slight cold and felt unwell, so he applied for a day off from the authorities the other day to rest. He has recovered slightly and reported back to work yesterday, performing in the play "Jiaxing Prefecture." Zhou Xinfang and Others Busy with Spring Banquets: Zhou Xinfang, Gao Baisui, Wang Xichun, Jin Suwen, Liu Wenkui, Zhang Huicong, and others from the Yifeng Troupe at the Carlton Theater held a dinner party at Jinjiang Restaurant at 5 p.m. the day before yesterday. Zhou Xinfang is scheduled to host a spring banquet for all the performers at the Daya Restaurant today, and leading actors such as Gao Baisui are also planning to take turns holding celebratory events.

Zhang Meiying Returns to Shanghai by Ship: Zhang Meiying, the eldest daughter of Zhang Liankui, the backstage manager of the Dajing Troupe at the Xianshi Amusement Park, has been studying under the tutelage of Wu Yaoqing in Peiping for several months. She returned to Shanghai from Peiping on the Shuntian ship the other day and visited old friends backstage at Xianshi that evening. It has not yet been decided whether she will return north.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (124)

— Xu Muyun

When Zhuge Liang Executed Ma Su, He Also Brought Along the Interrogation of Li Qi

One year, when Lao Tan performed "Empty City" and "Executing Ma Su," Li Shoushan played Ma Su. While Lao Tan was putting on his makeup backstage, he smiled and said to his colleagues backstage, "Today I'm singing 'Executing Ma Su,' and I'm also bringing along an interrogation of Li Qi." Everyone was baffled. Who knew that when it came time to push Ma Su out for execution, Old Li Qi laughed loudly three times to the sky. Lao Tan then called him back and asked, "General, why are you laughing?" Shoushan never expected Lao Tan to ask such a question and was immediately dumbfounded, unable to answer a single word. How could he not be booed? Fortunately, Lao Tan said, "Quickly push him out and execute him," which saved Li Qi. If not, he would not have been spared until he answered the reason for his laughter. But at this time, Ma Su regretted his carelessness and deserved to be punished. He also thought about his eighty-year-old mother at home, whom he could not take care of. In this situation, he couldn't even cry, let alone laugh loudly three times. Moreover, Ma Su's killing was because he admitted his guilt and died without resentment, which was very different from the execution of Shan Xiongxin in the "Locking the Dragon" (Wu Chang mistakenly written as Wu) play. Xiongxin had a vendetta against Li Shimin for killing his brother and repeatedly disrupted the Tang Dynasty. After he was captured, the brothers of Wagang Village all came forward to offer wine and sacrifices. Xiongxin deliberately made a heroic statement: "In twenty years, I will be reborn again." Therefore, Xiongxin could laugh three times when he was executed to show that he didn't care about life and death. His laugh was directed at his great enemy Li Shimin and everyone else, as if to say, "Your Grandpa Shan doesn't care about this knife." Therefore, his laugh was appropriate and in line with the plot. In the play "Executing Ma Su," no matter who played Ma Su, no one had ever heard of laughing three times. Only this restless, rule-breaking Big Li Qi, at will, arbitrarily added three laughs to this play. In the past, when he sang with other old Sheng, people didn't bother to argue with him and let him mess around. Today, he was unlucky and ran into Old Tan, who was serious about acting and full of tricks, who deliberately and suddenly called him back twice to ask him the reason for his laughter, which made him a big cripple. This was something he never expected in his dreams. Lao Tan first said "Executing Ma Su' bring an interrogation of Li Qi,'" everyone was confused and didn't know what was going on. It wasn't until the play was over that everyone understood that Lao Tan's "interrogation of Li Qi" was actually interrogating Big Li Qi.

### This Year's Wishes of Hollywood Movie Stars

Shirley Temple: This year, I want to work hard to make myself interested in mathematics and study it well.

Sonja Henie: I will vigorously promote various sports such as swimming, tennis, and skating, so that people all over the world can become interested in sports.

Warner Baxter: I wish to have a noble soul and a pure body.

Peter Lorre: I hope to speak American correctly this year and eat less sausage (Note: fearing obesity and damage to his appearance).

John David: I will try to let my colleagues know that I am a dignified person.

### Reading and Hygiene

— Wei Hua

Children: You must have heard your parents or teachers tell stories like these: Studying by the light of snow! Studying with fireflies in a bag! Chipping a hole in the wall to steal light! Hanging one's head from the beam and stabbing one's thigh! These people's diligence in studying is certainly admirable, but should we learn from them? Children: I must tell you: We should never learn from them, because these studying methods are the most unhygienic! That is to say, they are most harmful to the body!

Let's talk about studying by the light of snow first! Although the color of snow is white, it must still be blurry when it shines on the words at night. This is very harmful to our eyes. The eyes are the most important thing in the human body. If your eyes are damaged, that would be such an unfortunate thing! That brother who studied by the light of snow did so because he didn't have money to buy oil for a lamp. If you can study under an electric light now, that's certainly very good; otherwise, you'd rather not study. Damaging your eyes is not a good thing!

In addition, borrowing the light of fireflies to study is also not good. It's not easy to catch many fireflies, and even if you can catch them, the light is likely to be very weak.

Let's talk about chipping a hole in the wall to steal light. If you don't have lamplight to study by, you can try to sit by a street lamp and read, or you can go somewhere else to find lamplight; chipping a hole in the wall is always not a good thing. Just imagine how unsightly it is to have a hole dug in the wall!

Finally, let's talk about "hanging one's head from the beam and stabbing one's thigh." Do you understand the meaning of these six characters? This means that a person in the past studied very diligently and didn't sleep at night. But after working for a long time, people will always be tired; their eyes will naturally close, and their heads will naturally lower. To prevent his head from lowering, this person tied his hair to the beam with a rope, and to prevent himself from falling asleep, he often stabbed his buttocks and thighs with an awl. Look how foolish this person is! What's the use of such diligence? We know that adults need eight hours of sleep every day, and children need at least ten hours of sleep every day; not sleeping is absolutely not allowed, and our knowledge is not only in books—nature is our greatest school!

### The Founder of the Boy Scouts, Baden-Powell

— Yang Chunlü

Children who have been Boy Scouts all know Baden-Powell. He is the founder of the Boy Scouts, so every Boy Scout remembers him deeply. The day before yesterday, when we commemorated Chinese Boy Scout Day, we especially couldn't forget him.

He was a very brave and intelligent British soldier who lived a hard life in the army, exposed to the elements and sleeping in the open. But he had a spirit of endurance and hard work, and didn't feel the hardship of life.

When the war between Britain and South Africa broke out in 1899, he stepped onto the battlefield. Although Britain had an advantage in this war, he always felt that the British soldiers were far less hardworking and enduring than the African soldiers. He also knew that this habit of hard work and endurance needed to be cultivated in childhood.

So, in 1907, he gathered a group of lively children and formed the Boy Scouts; on a secluded island, he began to conduct various training exercises. In just a few months, the results were very good. Everyone became strong and healthy children who could serve society, and they became known to the general public. The Boy Scout movement spread from Britain to the whole world.

Children: Please tell your friends who can't afford to go to school. Hurry up and register for classes at the Obligatory Elementary School on the second floor of No. 4 Fuxingli, next to the World Book Company on Simalu. Tuition is free, and books and stationery are provided.

### Precious Morning

— Zhong Yan

Dear children, do you like "sleeping in"? I think you must like it. Especially on winter mornings, sleeping in a warm bed is so comfortable! But children! Do you know the ancient sayings "The plan for a year lies in spring, the plan for a day lies in morning"? Morning is the most precious time of day, because the air is exceptionally fresh at this time, and our minds are very alert after a night's rest. If we read or write at this time, we will make progress very quickly, and getting up early every day to breathe some fresh air is also very beneficial to our health. Children! Are you willing to waste such a precious morning? If you're not willing, then start forming the habit of getting up early from today onwards, don't be greedy for the warm bed, and let the precious morning be wasted in vain.

Many children like to read or write at night, which is very bad, because after a day of work, a person's energy is very exhausted by the evening. If you read at this time, no matter how hard you work, your progress will definitely be very slow. For example, sometimes you can't figure out a difficult math problem no matter how hard you try, but if you think about it again tomorrow morning, you can easily figure it out. This proves that the mind is much more alert in the morning than in the evening, so children who like to read at night! Quickly change your habits, go to bed early at night, get up early in the morning, and do the homework you need to do at night in the morning. If you can follow the above instructions and continue to do so, I think your knowledge will definitely improve very quickly. Perhaps you can get first place this semester. When you take the prize and the certificate home and receive praise from your father and mother, will you feel happy in your heart at that time?

Dear children! Do you want to get prizes and certificates? Hurry up and study hard in the precious morning!

### Being a Little Wireless Radio Enthusiast (5)

— Xi Ren

3. Antenna and Ground Wire

"So, what is an antenna made of?" Wang Min, after looking at the antennas on the roofs of the houses around the small garden for a while, asked his cousin. Wang Min had this habit; when he didn't understand something, he had to ask until he understood it clearly.

"You can buy antennas in wireless radio shops; we don't need to make them ourselves. But I can tell you what things are used to make an antenna: An antenna is made by twisting many copper wires (about seven to eight strands) together into one, then attaching the previously mentioned insulators to both ends, and then stretching it out on the roof."

After Wang Min's cousin finished that long explanation, he paused for a moment, rubbed his hands together, looked up at the sky, and suddenly remembered something, saying urgently to Wang Min: "I almost forgot to tell you, there's another style of antenna."

"What style is it?" Wang Min asked quickly.

"Slow down, let me tell you slowly. When it comes to installing a wireless radio, it also depends on the location. For example, in Shanghai, every street is filled with dense buildings, making it very difficult to string up an antenna, unlike in the open countryside, where there's open space on all sides, making it very easy to string up an antenna. In such a situation, we have to think of a small and space-saving antenna. Because this antenna is placed inside the house, we call it an indoor antenna, and because its shape resembles a spider's web, we also call it a spider web antenna.

"I've never seen this kind of antenna before!" Wang Min said.

"How would you see it? People keep them in their rooms. Look, there's a picture in this book that shows this spider web antenna." Wang Min's cousin casually picked up a book and pointed to a photo inside for Wang Min to see (see Figure 5).

"There's also a frame in this picture."

"Yes, the entire antenna body is mounted on a frame, and this frame is movable, able to turn around in all directions."

"Why does it need to turn around? Wouldn't it be better if it was fixed?" Wang Min always asked about things he didn't understand, but his cousin didn't find it troublesome and always patiently explained to him with a smile.

"Yes, it could originally be fixed and not moved, but you have to know that an antenna installed inside a house will receive less electricity than one outside. So we must make this antenna movable, turning it around in all directions until the loudest sound comes out of the radio, and then fix it in place." He paused, then said, "As for antennas, I think that's all I can say. Now we can talk about ground wires."

"There's a ground wire after having an antenna?" Wang Min found it very strange.

"A ground wire is also an important component in a wireless radio, especially in the crystal radio we'll be trying to assemble soon. It can make a big difference in loudness."

"The antenna is installed in the air, so the ground wire must be installed underground?"

"That's right!" his cousin said. "The ground wire is installed underground. The common way to install it is to drive a long iron rod into the ground, and then connect a wire from that iron rod to the radio."

Spring Special

### Spring Has Come

— Zheng Benren, 6th Grade Student at Early Spring Elementary School

The god of spring has descended! All living things in the universe are joyfully welcoming it. It adorns the withered and haggard earth, making it as beautiful as a woman. God of spring! How great is your power!

Listen! The lovely and lively little birds are singing spring songs on the branches, seemingly urging people to quickly get to work and not waste this joyful spring.

Look! Many plants are sprouting fresh leaves and blooming beautiful flowers. All these sights express the joy of spring! Ah! Gentle weather, beautiful scenery, how lovely spring is!

This lovely spring brings such beautiful scenery, presenting scene after scene for us to see, making our bodies and minds comfortable and our spirits happy. How should we thank it?

Classmates! The year's plan lies in spring. Now that spring has arrived, let us quickly work hard in a timely manner!

### Spring and Reading

— Guo Yusheng, 4th Grade Student at National Light Elementary School

The withered grass of winter is now thriving, and the old trees on the roadsides are also sprouting new buds. The insects and birds are also stirring and lively. Humans, known as the most intelligent of all creatures, naturally feel very happy in this spring. However, lovely spring still passes like a fleeting moment. The ancients said, "The year's plan lies in spring," so we should study with extra diligence in this gentle and warm spring. Otherwise, we will have to wait another year to have this bright spring light.

Among the seasons of the year, the one in which we find reading most interesting and make the most progress is none other than spring, right? In summer, there is sultry sunlight; in autumn, there are noisy insect sounds; in the depths of winter, there is piercing north wind. So, let's work hard at reading. Besides spring, what other season is there?

Work hard! Friends! Don't waste this spring.

### Thoughts on Spring

— Yang Sheng, 6th Grade Student at Shanghai Elementary School

Spring has come again! The warm spring sunlight has driven away the cruel winter! We are listening to the birds singing melodious songs under the bright sunshine and watching the flowers and plants gradually grow in the soil. Ah! How happy we are!

But I have gained a thought from the arrival of spring:

The cruel cold we encounter is just like the setbacks we encounter when doing things. The arrival of spring is just like the success we achieve in doing things. We endure the cold, and then we can enjoy the warmth of spring. This is telling us that "when doing things, overcome all difficulties and endure all failures, and then you will get a satisfactory result."

Little friends! Don't play anymore! Wait until your own or your country's career gets a satisfactory result, and then celebrate greatly!

### Spring in My Hometown

— Ma Yuanyong, 6th Grade Student at Zhendong Elementary School

The spring of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1939] has descended upon the world. Undoubtedly, another year has begun. Spring is like a gentle maiden, and also like a loving old mother. She gives us warm wind and gentle sunlight. All living things on the earth, after being nurtured by spring, grow vigorously and sprout. People also receive the baptism of spring light and feel a hundred times more energetic. Spring has no bias at all, and it steps equally into my hometown, which is trampled under the iron hooves [of the Japanese invaders]. Thinking of my hometown cannot help but make me feel sorrowful. I remember on this day two years ago, a group of us children, under the protection of the god of spring, went on a spring outing in the suburbs. At that time, the peach blossoms were red and the willows were green; how beautiful it was! But now? The beautiful hometown only has some broken bricks and tiles and a scorched earth left. It's not as lovely as before. Moreover, several of our little friends have either died or run away. There is no chance to meet again. Heavens! Who has deprived us of all the rights of spring? The spring of my hometown cannot be appreciated anymore.

### Small Things

— Ci Kai

A very high wall is built of many bricks. A very long journey is completed by taking many "steps," one after another. If there were no bricks, there would be no high wall. If you are unwilling to take even one step, you cannot complete even a short journey.

Let's use even bigger things as metaphors: A high mountain is formed by accumulating many pieces of soil. If there were no pieces of soil, where would the high mountain come from? The water in the vast ocean is accumulated drop by drop. If there were no drops of water, where would the vast ocean come from?

Some children say: One copper coin can't buy anything significant, so it's better to spend it casually. Some children say: Getting up twenty minutes early every morning still doesn't allow me to get any work done, so it's better not to get up early at all. But one copper coin every day, accumulated for a year, amounts to one yuan and two jiao. Reading two pages of a book every day allows you to finish a very thick book in a year.

The ancients said: "Do not fail to do good because the benefit is small, and do not do evil because the harm is small." This means that if there is a good deed, even if the benefit from doing it is very small, you should not fail to do it because the benefit is small. If there is an evil deed, even if the harm from doing it is very small, you should not do it because the harm is small.

Seeing a banana peel on the ground, picking it up, although the benefit is very small, may have saved an old person. Donating one cent to the refugee donation, although the benefit is very small, may have prevented a refugee child from starving to death. Spitting phlegm on the ground, although it seems that the harm is very small, may have caused many people to get sick because of your phlegm.

### Jiangshan Boat

— Bai Zheng

—Ming'er's Refugee Diary, No. 16—

That huge boat sailed towards the upper reaches of the vast Qiantang River. The small trees on both sides of the river, far away, were short and uneven. Ming'er looked at them and felt a little blurry, as if the trees were spinning and receding backwards. This was because the boat was moving forward. The river water kept hitting the hull of the boat, turning into snow-white waves, and in an instant, they disappeared without a trace, while also emitting a burst of splashing sounds.

It was the first time for Ming'er to live on a boat, and he had never ridden on such a large boat that used manpower to move forward. After asking his father, he learned that it was called a Jiangshan boat. Therefore, he felt that this opportunity was very rare. If it weren't for fleeing the disaster, who would be happy to ride on such a clumsy and slow boat?

The boat was made of fir wood, and the boatmen cherished it very much because it was their only lifeline. Therefore, they painted a layer of yellowish tung oil all over the boat, and there was not a trace of mud on it. This showed a very clean and simple appearance. The boat shed was made of reeds and bamboo strips, and it covered the boat in a semi-circle. This was the boat cabin. The front was fitted with door panels, and there were even glass windows, which was very elaborate. Inside the cabin, there were six low bunks. Above the bunks, there were wooden shelves, one after another, where all the necessary utensils for the boat were placed: bamboo poles, oars, bamboo hats, raincoats, etc. In one corner of the stern of the boat, there were two most important things: firewood stoves. The tinplate around them on the boat panels was scrubbed as white as new. Further past, there were rows of bamboo tubes hanging, filled with oil, salt, soy sauce, and other things, hung high up, truly not taking up any space. Everything on the boat could be said to be clean and simple, arranged in an orderly manner, with every inch of space utilized according to the so-called principle of economy.

On the stern of the boat stood an old man with white hair, not very tall, with a complexion that was coarse yellow and dark. Fine wrinkles like spider webs were densely spread on his forehead. His clothes were very clean and simple, and his cheeks were full of short, coarse whiskers. He had a pipe in his mouth and one hand on the rudder, looking very comfortable. It was said to be the boat boss's father.

A woman was holding a rice basket, bending over, with almost half of her body outside the boat, her rough hands washing rice. Because the boat panels were very high, it was necessary to do this. She wore a large bun, dressed in dark blue calico, and her body seemed very sturdy, but her feet were bound small. This showed that it was not easy to change this deeply rooted custom in the inland.

On the bow of the boat, a mast that went straight into the clouds seemed to be leaning on the boat shed. The boat boss stood at the bow and poled, and four boatmen were lined up on both sides, each using their strength to pole. The bow of the boat was very pointed and high, very much like a dragon boat. This could reduce the resistance of the water.

Ming'er looked at everything so carefully because he was really too bored. After being tired of looking in the cabin, he walked out of the cabin, stretched his head, and looked at the surrounding scenery. After looking at it for too long and finding it too boring, he walked back in, either lying down or asking his mother for something to eat. Ming'er felt that he had more freedom than on the small boat to Hangzhou, but he didn't know how many days it would take to get to Tunxi. The boat was moving so slowly, and it was unbearably stuffy.

### Trachoma

— He Gongchao

For the past few weeks, Ying'er had been feeling like there was something rubbing in his eyes when he reviewed his lessons at night, and he couldn't open his eyes in the light and would tear up. However, Ying'er didn't tell his mother about this, thinking it was because his eyes were tired from reading too much. Later, the rubbing in his eyes became more and more severe day by day, and it became more and more uncomfortable day by day.

Ying'er became afraid and said to his mother:

"Mom, lately, it feels like there's something rubbing in my eyes, and I tear up often. What's going on?"

"Why didn't you tell me earlier?" his mother complained. "This must be trachoma. I'll take you to an ophthalmologist tomorrow."

"What's trachoma? I don't understand."

"Trachoma is a contagious disease. If you get infected, small, granular things will grow on the inner eyelid, like grains of sand. If you don't treat it, it will get worse year by year, and you might go blind. In the future, you must never use their towels to wipe your eyes in public places such as barber shops, theaters, and restaurants, because these towels are carriers of trachoma."

The next day, Ying'er's mother took him to an ophthalmologist, and the doctor treated him carefully. After a month, Ying'er's trachoma was cured, and he no longer felt rubbing or tearing up.

### Snow White (11)

— Tian Sun

But Snow White, with both persuasion and deceit, took them outside to the water trough in the yard and began to bathe them. When she returned to the house, she saw them splashing water all over themselves, wiping and rubbing, very happy. Only Old Stubborn still refused to wash.

He still stood by and mocked his companions: "Hehe, you are a good bunch of beautiful little lotus flowers! You just wait. She will even get a red ribbon and tie up your beards, and even sprinkle some perfume behind your ears! I want to see who has the ability to make me take a bath. Only then will I admire him!"

As soon as he said this, the other dwarfs immediately rushed over, lifted Old Stubborn to the water trough, and prepared to push him into the water.

Just then, they suddenly heard Snow White shout, "Dinner is ready!"

They threw Old Stubborn out of the water, as if throwing down a hot sweet potato. The six dwarfs happily returned to the house for dinner.

In that palace, however, evil things were going on. The queen, having learned from the magic mirror that the huntsman had disobeyed her order and had not killed Snow White, but had secretly let her go, was furious. She swore to Heaven that if she did not kill Snow White in one day, she would not sleep or eat for one day. This determination could not be shaken by anyone. So she hurriedly prepared everything, intending to go to the seven dwarfs' house herself tomorrow morning.

The queen first grabbed a tattered book, and spiders were crawling out of the dust-covered, yellowed pages. She seemed not to see them, but just eagerly flipped through the book page by page. Finally, she turned to the page about disguise, which she found satisfactory, and decided to follow it.

Then she said to herself, "This is exactly what I was thinking, to disguise myself as an old peddler woman! That little Snow White will definitely fall for it and will never drive away a poor old peddler woman. I have to sell her some good things, all very beautiful things! Hmph, yes, I also have to sell her 'death'!"

At this time, the queen was truly like a madwoman, running back and forth between those curved-necked distillers and glass bottles, looking here and looking there. Finally, she picked up a pale blue cup carved in the shape of a skull, poured several strange liquids into it, and stirred them together.

After stirring it well, she brought the cup to her mouth and drank the entire cup of liquid in one gulp. Strangely enough, after a short while, the queen transformed into an old woman with a terrible appearance. Her hands and claws were like animal claws, and her laughter sounded like a ghost's cry, very frightening. Her beloved crow perched on a skull, watching her frantically prepare everything, preparing to end Snow White's life. The queen let out a sinister and terrible voice, saying very triumphantly to herself, "Hehe, this time it couldn't be done more cleverly. One bite of a poisoned apple is all it takes to fall asleep as if soundly sleeping, and never wake up again. Those dwarfs will have to bury that little Snow White alive! As for the antidote, it's not that there isn't one. It must be the first kiss of a lover to wake her up, but where does she have any lover? Who will go and wake her up? Hehe, hehe, hehe!"
