### UK Drafting Tough Demands to be Raised in Tokyo Negotiations; Urging Japanese to Lift Tianjin Blockade and Suppress Anti-British Movement in Various Regions

(London) The British government is today drafting several extremely tough counter-demands to be presented to the Japanese side during the Anglo-Japanese negotiations to be held in Tokyo this week. These will include the following: (1) Reopen all ports in China and allow foreign merchants to trade and navigate freely; (2) Open Japanese-occupied areas, especially the Yangtze River basin, and allow foreign trade; (3) Immediately lift the blockade of Tianjin and guarantee that British citizens will not be subjected to the same 'intolerable' insults in the future; (4) Immediately suppress the anti-British movement in Japanese-occupied areas; (5) Immediately release British military officer Lieutenant Colonel Spear, who was detained by the Japanese army in Zhangjiakou on May 26 and has not been released despite repeated British representations. (Dispatch of 2nd by Mr. Miller, European Manager of the Associated Press)

(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese negotiations on resolving the Tianjin dispute are scheduled to be held on the 4th. Japanese politicians and journalists have initiated the convening of mass rallies to lecture on Anglo-Japanese relations. Japanese newspapers are also extensively promoting the idea that Japan has achieved great victories in the past two years and that all its gains may be forfeited should the negotiations with UK go wrong. Therefore, the Japanese people must unite and struggle on the same political front to make Britain fear Japan. (2nd Haitong Dispatch)

(Rome) The Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Tianjin incident will be held in Tokyo within days. Renowned reporter Gayda (considered the mouthpiece of Prime Minister Mussolini) recently commented on the matter in the Italian Daily, believing that the two sides may not be able to reach an agreement. He stated that Japan's goal is to cut off supplies to the Chinese army, which it must achieve. As for Britain, with the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union still inconclusive, it is feigning a desire to conclude an agreement with Japan in order to intimidate the Soviet Union. Based on this, Japan's attitude towards Britain is understandably one of suspicion. (2nd Havas Dispatch)

### Another Englishman Humiliated in Tianjin

(Tianjin) Today, a British resident of Tianjin named Anderson encountered an obstacle on Wilson Street and entered the Japanese Concession to see his mother. Anderson lived in the British Concession, while his mother lived in the Japanese Concession, and they had not seen each other for many days. At the obstacle, he presented his passport to a Chinese policeman, who then passed it to a Japanese officer. The officer ordered Anderson to remove his hat, saying, "I cannot speak to you while you are wearing a hat." Anderson immediately removed his hat. The Japanese officer asked if he could speak Chinese. Anderson replied that he could. The officer then ordered him to remove his glasses and strip off his clothes, leaving only his shirt and pants. Anderson obeyed carefully. The officer then said, "Do you think you have nothing to fear just because you are British?" and struck Anderson's face twice with his passport, throwing it on the ground among Anderson's clothes. Finally, he allowed Anderson to put on his clothes and pass through the obstacle. Anderson returned to the British Concession via another obstacle in the afternoon, without being disturbed. Anderson was born in Tianjin and is a young man currently working for the Tianjin and Beijing Times newspaper. After the British Consul-General in Tianjin warned British residents not to leave the Concession lightly unless there was a special reason, things remained quiet for several days until today's incident.

### Importance of the Burma Road

(Singapore) Song Zi'ang, younger brother of former Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen and director of the Southwest Transportation Company, which operates thousands of trucks on the Burma Road, passed through Singapore by plane en route to Rangoon and told reporters that the original purpose of the Burma Road was as a commercial road between China and Britain. All of China's products, such as tung oil, bristles, and leather, which were previously shipped down the Yangtze River for export, will now pass through the Burma Road. In addition to the sea route, the road has provided Britain with a new route for trade with China. Once the Yunnan-Burma Railway is built, Rangoon will become even more important, as products from all of southwestern China will pass through it. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)

### Bishop Norris Returns to Beiping from Shanxi

The property is worth 400,000 yuan, but the Japanese side is only willing to pay 75,000 yuan. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)

Editorial

### Tension in Danzig and the Overall Situation

Germany's scheme to seize the Free City of Danzig, in terms of political arrangements, is that German officials and the Danzig authorities have openly and unreservedly admitted to their collusion; in terms of military planning, German combat personnel and large quantities of light and heavy weapons are constantly pouring into Danzig, almost openly; overall, the recent developments have indeed reached the stage of revealing the final intentions. As a result, those concerned about world affairs are asking whether there will be war in the future.

No war means temporary peace. War, however, would affect almost all of humanity in space and future centuries in time, which is no small matter. As things stand now, there are indeed some reasons to say that there will be no war, but there are many problems blocking the way and hanging unresolved, and the mutual stimulation and turbulence cannot be prolonged; moreover, the arms race is intensifying without end, and no war is no solution either. If it is said that war is inevitable, then Hitler is full of hope that things will fall into place without war; Chamberlain hopes to prevent the outbreak of war with the determination to go to war; that is, neither side wants war. Therefore, it is impossible to answer whether there will be war or not today.

Moreover, the essence of the problem is not in the so-called war or no war. It lies in how each country can revise its attitude and restrain its desires in order to resolve disputes; it should also be based on establishing long-term peace and stability, and not spare some reasonable sacrifices; for example, the recent agreement between France and Turkey, which makes the situation in the clarified Mediterranean region more moderate and stable, can indeed be called a representative work of modern human civilization. Therefore, the current crux is where the path to peace lies. If this is not the plan, either the independence and freedom of other countries will be disregarded, and the pursuit of gain will be taken as pleasure; or they will aspire to an immeasurable future with excessive self-esteem, or they will take the historical fragments of the past as the standard, vying for hegemony and seeking the ultimate and unrivaled supremacy of vanity and material benefit without end; or they will seek to gain as much as possible where there is an opportunity and a gap to be exploited, or they will seek to keep as much as possible when the temporary environment is favorable to them, using all means possible to borrow from their own strength and even the strength of others, calculating every penny; all these, their consciousness fundamentally does not value peace, and if such friction does not lead to war, it is not that there is no way to avoid war, nor that there is a fork in the road between war and no war, but only a lucky avoidance of war. Tracing back to the international disputes since the Spanish Civil War, through the Munich Agreement; in between, there were changes such as those in Czechoslovakia, Austria, Memel, and Albania; nothing could not be fought, and each time there was a reason to start a war; although no war has been started so far, the tension is increasing, and the main problems in Europe remain unresolved. With the path to peace vague and distant, the question is not whether to fight, but only when to fight. If Danzig is indeed seized by Germany, it is a common trick for Germany; if this leads to a major war, it is not surprising in terms of the principle of the matter.

Therefore, in view of the evolution of the Danzig issue and the tension in Europe, and paying attention to the development of the Danzig issue in the coming weeks, as well as the actions of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, the actual question that exists is how long the temporary peace can be maintained? Hitler's ambition is the driving force of war, and his private desire for a non-war solution is not enough to guarantee temporary peace; Chamberlain's determination to go to war is enough to delay the war, but his thought of war and his hope to avoid it will induce the reckless to advance. Although the result of the reckless advance may be that the League of Nations commissioners of the Free City of Danzig will not only do nothing but also express indifference, or that Poland will abandon Danzig in time without resistance, or that Britain and France will not fulfill their commitments due to any theoretical basis and factual reasons, there is still a one in a million chance that there will be no war; however, under the leadership of Hitler, Germany's national power is increasing day by day, and its desires are insatiable. Therefore, even if Danzig is settled without war, the European situation's no war is still only a matter of time. Moreover, silently observing the international situation, there are those who fear that the world will not be in chaos, who wish to stay out of it, reap the benefits, and engage in superficial compliance and secret incitement, there must be such people. In short, all international disputes need to be resolved, and the foundation of peace needs to be established, which cannot be achieved without the most active action. Without resolving disputes and establishing the foundation of peace, the scourge of war cannot be eliminated. The outbreak of war is only a matter of time, and the form of war will be an indiscriminate melee. The so-called active action is not appeasement of flattering the strong and suppressing the weak, not passive mutual assistance and response to war, but holding justice in one hand and a sword in the other, forcing the aggressor to submit!

### Ministry of Finance Announces Measures for Prohibiting the Import of Goods During Extraordinary Times - Statement from the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance

(Chongqing) The Ministry of Finance announced the following measures for prohibiting the import of goods during extraordinary times: (1) According to the eighteen groups and two hundred and thirty-four tariff headings of imported goods listed in the attached table, the Ministry of Finance shall order the Chief Inspector of Customs to instruct all customs offices to uniformly prohibit imports. (2) After the issuance of the aforementioned prohibition of import goods, the re-export of goods shall also be prohibited simultaneously. (3) If the prohibited imported goods are for regulating post-market prices, for special purposes, or for other legitimate reasons, and have been verified and requested by government agencies, the Ministry of Finance may examine the actual needs and issue special purchase and transport permits, and separate measures shall be established for issuing permits. (4) These measures shall also apply to prohibited imported goods that are sent by mail from overseas or re-exported from domestic ports. (2nd dispatch)

(Chongqing) The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance recently made a statement on the significance of announcing the measures for prohibiting the import of goods during extraordinary times, as follows:

"Maintaining a balance of international payments is essential in the economic policy of any country. During wartime, trade tends to be adverse, and the government should adopt various methods to maintain balance, so as not to affect the national economy and hinder the progress of the war. China has long suffered from a large trade deficit, and the defense products and industrial and transportation equipment needed during wartime still rely heavily on imports. If the adverse trend of international payments is not reversed, it will inevitably

affect the exchange rate

market and hinder the economy. In view of this, the Ministry drafted the "Outline of Measures for Promoting Production and Adjusting Trade" in September of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], established three adjustment committees for agricultural, industrial and mining trade, and allocated additional funds to establish war risk insurance, which are essential economic strategies during wartime. At the same time, it also drafted a management plan for prohibiting, limiting, and permitting imports and submitted it for approval. Due to various reasons, the import management plan was not approved for implementation. Later, when foreign exchange management was implemented in March of last year, an import management plan was proposed again, selecting certain types of luxury goods and non-essential luxury goods, planning to separately

prohibit and limit imports

Items needed for the war of resistance, reconstruction and daily use were approved for the government bank to sell foreign exchange at the legal price. However, due to external doubts and obstruction, it could not be put into practice. In the past year or so, the enemy and puppets have used our tax revenue and plundered our resources to exchange a large amount of legal currency for foreign exchange, which has caused unprecedented drastic changes in the foreign exchange market in recent years. Since the establishment of the Exchange Stabilization Fund and the participation of British banks in the stabilization work, which was originally a kind intention of British assistance and also a way to facilitate international trade, the stabilization work has been

difficult

During the War of Resistance, the people should practice thrift, reduce unnecessary consumption, and increase the purchasing power of essential goods, in line with the principle of military first and victory first. After careful discussion, it was agreed that prohibiting the import of some goods is a necessary measure during wartime and will surely be understood by Chinese and foreign people. That is, all items that are not essential for the War of Resistance, national construction, and daily life, or have partial needs but can be replaced by domestic products, or are mostly produced and imported from enemy countries and are easily counterfeited and sold, should be prohibited from import.

Prohibited goods

The Ministry drafted a prohibition plan according to the above standards. For example, foreign wine, foreign cigarettes, seafood, silk goods, cosmetics, ornaments, toys, musical instruments, some sugar products, prepared foods, canned fruits, vegetables, as well as luxury wool and cotton goods, wood, paper, bamboo and rattan products, earth and stone products, and liquid fuels that can be replaced, totaling two hundred and thirty-four tariff headings, are all on the prohibited list. The Ministry has telegraphed the Chief Inspector of Customs to telegraph to the customs offices to uniformly prohibit imports from the date of the order. After the above items are prohibited from import, according to the import amount in the 27th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], it is estimated that more than 230 million yuan can be saved, equivalent to 68 million US dollars and 13 million British pounds.

Huge amount of foreign exchange

This expenditure can be used to purchase materials necessary for the War of Resistance and national construction. In China, this is just a change in the use of foreign exchange. In other countries, it is just a conversion of imported goods. In essence, the statistics of its trade with China will not be greatly reduced, and it should be able to obtain the full understanding of friendly countries. The measures for prohibiting the import of goods during extraordinary times are recorded as follows:

(1) According to the eighteen groups and two hundred and thirty-four tariff headings of imported goods listed in the attached table, all customs offices shall uniformly prohibit imports.

(2) After the aforementioned prohibition of import goods, the re-export of goods shall also be prohibited simultaneously.

(3) If the prohibited imported goods are for regulating post-market prices, for special purposes, or for other legitimate reasons, and have been verified and requested by government agencies, the Ministry of Finance may examine the actual needs and issue special purchase and transport permits, and separate measures shall be established for issuing permits.

(4) These measures shall also apply to prohibited imported goods that are sent by mail from overseas or re-exported from domestic ports. The detailed list of names and tariff headings of prohibited imported goods will be announced in the newspapers separately. (2nd dispatch)

### Measures for Settling Foreign Exchange for Export Goods and Receiving Exchange Rate Difference

(Chongqing) The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance recently made a statement on the significance of announcing the "Measures for Settling Foreign Exchange for Export Goods and Receiving Exchange Rate Difference," as follows: Regarding the significance and measures for prohibiting non-essential imported goods, a statement has already been issued separately. At the same time, the Ministry has always considered the issue of promoting export trade to be extremely important. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, it has formulated the "Outline of Measures for Promoting Production and Adjusting Trade," organized trade adjustment agencies, and promulgated various adjustment measures. In June of last year, it also promulgated

Maintaining production

Measures to promote exports, in addition to using methods such as exempting donations and taxes, providing war risk insurance, facilitating transportation, and financing funds to assist merchants in operating export trade, government trade agencies also purchase as much as possible in order to increase exports and revitalize production. However, in recent years, due to traffic difficulties, domestic products cannot be exported in large quantities, and the number of exports has decreased accordingly. Under such circumstances, merchants have increased costs and insufficient funds, and they inevitably doubt and fear operating exports.

Foreign firms

which have been operating exports in the country also hinder exports due to non-normal trade, which is not the intention of the Ministry to maintain the national economy. In addition, due to recent foreign exchange market changes, in order to assist the stabilization work and reduce its difficulties, the Ministry has drafted the "Measures for Settling Foreign Exchange for Export Goods and Receiving Exchange Rate Difference." Except for tung oil, tea, bristles, and minerals, which are related to barter debt repayment and material storage, the foreign exchange obtained from other export goods should be settled at the legal price and sold to the national bank. At the same time, the Central Bank will give an amount equivalent to the difference between the legal price and the bank's listed price. By doing so, most export goods can be

freely transported and sold

The huge amount of exchange rate obtained can be used to pay fees and still obtain the remainder. The government has solved all the difficulties of the merchants. The foreign exchange needed by the government can still be largely concentrated in maintaining the legal currency and stabilizing finance. It can also promote exports and increase production, which is a comprehensive consideration for the national economy and people's livelihood. The measures for settling foreign exchange for export goods and receiving the exchange rate difference are recorded below:

(1) All export goods should be settled in foreign exchange. Except for tung oil, tea, bristles, and minerals, which are related to barter debt repayment and material storage and should be purchased and sold by government trade agencies at preferential prices at any time based on production and sales conditions and international market prices, other goods, whether sold by government trade agencies or traded by commercial firms themselves, must sell the foreign exchange obtained to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications at the legal price. The legal currency to be obtained from the sale shall be paid by the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications at the designated inland location with the consent of the exchange settler.

(2) After the actual settlement of foreign exchange amount for the export goods settled at the legal price in the preceding paragraph, the exchange rate difference between the legal price and the bank's listed price may be received from the settling bank upon presentation of the settlement documents. The bank may charge the settling party the usual handling fee that the bank should obtain, but it shall not exceed three percent.

(3) The aforementioned difference shall be paid by the original settling bank at the designated inland location with the consent of the settling party. (2nd dispatch)

### US House of Representatives Passes New Neutrality Act - Hull Considers it Unsatisfactory - Arms Embargo Clause Must Be Removed - This is Greatly Related to Preventing War

(Washington) Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to reporters, saying that it is regrettable that the neutrality bill sponsored by the government has failed. Efforts should be continued to ensure that the arms embargo clause is not included in the new neutrality bill. "I previously sent letters to the chairmen of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives on May 29 of this year, listing six points for the peace and neutrality plan. I firmly believe that it is sufficient for our country to maintain peace and not be dragged into the vortex of war. The legislative method containing the arms embargo clause or other similar clauses is more effective. Before submitting this plan, I repeatedly talked with the members of the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives and members of various parties, and then sent it to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee for review. Initially, the international situation was such that even if this plan was not completely satisfactory, it should be accepted by a majority of members of Congress. Unexpectedly, it failed by a few votes. For the sake of maintaining the interests of peace and for the most valuable interests of our country's international relations, it is regrettable. In fact, my plan is not only the best way for our country to maintain peace after the outbreak of war, but the most important point is that it helps prevent the war, which is far better than the current neutrality law or other similar laws. It is even more a matter of course to be fully in line with the universally recognized international law. Therefore, I should continue to work hard to ensure that the recommendations I have put forward can be adopted by Congress," he said. (1st dispatch from Havas)

(Paris) Regarding the resolution passed by the US House of Representatives the day before yesterday prohibiting the supply of arms to belligerent countries, the astonishment of French people can be seen in today's newspapers. Disappointment and worry are overflowing in words. All newspapers said that if war breaks out, President Roosevelt will probably be unable to do anything about supplying arms to Britain and France except to supply food and raw materials.

### Although US President's Financial Power Has Expired - The US Dollar Remains Stable - The Tripartite Monetary Agreement Operates as Usual

(Washington) The bill to extend the term of President Roosevelt's powers in the monetary and financial system failed to pass due to the delaying tactics of opposition senators. According to people in the Ministry of Finance, although the government cannot use the $2 billion US dollars of the exchange stabilization fund in the future, after the banks resume business after the three-day holiday this month, the Ministry of Finance can purchase gold at appropriate prices when necessary, and the Federal Reserve Bank can also buy and sell foreign exchange to maintain the stability of the US dollar. Therefore, although the president's financial power has expired, causing various difficulties, the tripartite monetary agreement between Britain, France and the United States can still operate as usual due to the cooperation of the Ministry of Finance and the Federal Reserve Bank. (1st dispatch from Havas)

(Washington) President Roosevelt's struggle to obtain monetary power came to a temporary standstill at the end of this week. It is still difficult to predict the outcome of this monetary struggle between the government and the opposition (including the Republican Party and the conservative Democratic Party). Even the vote on Wednesday may not be able to decide. The US President returned to his private residence in Hyde Park last night, planning to attack his "monetary enemies." US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau also returned to his private residence to rest last night, which is not far from the President's private residence, so it is expected that he will discuss with the President how to deal with the enemy. According to the President's friends, the President was extremely dissatisfied with the two defeats in Congress this week, and continued to study countermeasures until late Friday night. The House of Representatives accepted the recommendation last night to restore the President's power to devalue silver dollars, and set the domestic silver price at 71.1 cents per ounce.

### British Government Prevents Aggression Policy - All Parties in the Government and the Opposition Unanimously Firmly Support - Simon Says the Situation is Serious and Britain's Attitude is Absolutely Unhesitating - Eden Says the Future is Dangerous but Not Hopeless

(London) The British government and the opposition unanimously advocate taking a firm stand to resist aggression. All parties in the parliament are prepared to support the government's policy of resisting aggression. All these can be seen in the speeches made by the government cabinet members and the leaders of the parties.

Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon gave a speech in Sheffield yesterday, explaining the views of the British government, saying that the speech made by Foreign Secretary Halifax the day before yesterday not only represented the government and the people of the whole country, but also said what the rest of the world wanted to say. Although the content was very clear and firm, it was not provocative. Today, the position of the United Kingdom is very clear and leaves no room for doubt. In a nutshell, its purpose is to maintain peace. If world peace is destroyed and there is a need to rebuild the foundation, it is also determined to make the necessary sacrifices.

Sir Stafford Cripps, the leader of the extreme faction of the Labor Party, said in a speech in the Indian region, "We cannot tolerate anyone who attempts to control us, deprive us of our freedom, and interfere in our affairs. We must unite the whole country, unite all allied countries, and concentrate all our strength to implement self-defense."

Sir Archibald Sinclair, the leader of the opposition Liberal Party, declared in Bedford City that there is no defeatism in Britain. The hearts of the people are extremely firm, the military strength is extremely strong, and its resources are extremely abundant, which must be understood by the aggressor countries. At this point, Prime Minister Chamberlain must resign, and Churchill and Eden should be allowed to enter the cabinet. Minister of Mines Lloyd George said in a speech in Birmingham, "Although Britain hates war, it will fight to the end for Britain's freedom and independence when necessary."

Former Foreign Secretary Eden also gave a speech in Ealing, saying that if Britain's foreign policy can be understood by foreign countries, war can be avoided. The attitude of the British people is now very clear and has an unshakable determination. In the past, even if aggressive actions were not curbed, it is absolutely impossible in the future. The speech made by Foreign Secretary Halifax the day before yesterday has frankly explained the position of the British people, and his warning to all the powerful countries has been supported by the whole country. In a nutshell, the British people are determined and will not hesitate to face any threat and will no longer give in to force.

Sir Muirhead, chairman of the executive committee of the opposition Liberal Party, gave a detailed account of the current situation in Hyde Park, London, saying that if a new crisis occurs in the Free City of Danzig, no one will say that this matter has nothing to do with Britain. At that time, we will fight to defend freedom and democracy.

Conservative Party members held a meeting in Birmingham today and read out a letter from Prime Minister Chamberlain, saying, "I will continue to work hard to maintain peace in Europe, and at the same time, I am determined to resist all attempts at aggression or control. You can trust that at this moment, if other countries attack, the strength of our country's defense line is unprecedented." The far-right member of the lower house, Amery, then delivered a speech, saying that at this point, making frank words is of no use. Only by taking various practical measures can Hitler believe that our country's words and deeds are consistent and will fulfill its commitments. Although peace is not hopeless, we should immediately mobilize the navy and air force, and send aircraft to France when necessary, the number of which should be equal to the number required for combat. If this can be done, Germany will be alerted to our country's serious attitude. (1st dispatch from Havas)

(London) Greenwood, the acting leader of the Labor Party in the House of Commons, today expressed his views on the international situation to a Reuters reporter, saying that Britain is unwilling to go to war and will only fight to defend the principles on which its independence and freedom depend. Britain is determined to resist continued aggressive actions similar to those that have recently led to turmoil and fear in Europe. These actions destroy the dignity of the law and replace it with the power of the iron fist, which has endangered the foundation of civilization. Therefore, the willingness of peace or war is now entirely in the hands of potential aggressors. He hoped that the German people could grasp this fact and the disputes it contained. Greenwood reiterated that there is no struggle between the British and German people. The conflict now lies between the policy of aggression and the principle of free negotiations to resolve demands and disputes. (2nd dispatch from Reuters)

(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon said in a speech in Sheffield today that the general political situation is now very serious. Britain's position is now undoubted. Foreign Secretary Halifax's remarks are not only the opinion of the British government but also the public opinion of the British people and most of the world outside the British Empire. His words are not provocative, but firm and clear, so that the world understands Britain's position. As far as he knows, the British people have never been so united on such a big issue. Anyone who wants to know Britain's purpose can now understand it more clearly than before. (1st dispatch from Reuters)

(London) Former Foreign Secretary Eden said in a speech in Ealing tonight that the recent prospects are serious and dangerous, but not hopeless. If Britain's purpose is firm and understood by foreigners, war will not occur. Today, the attitude of the British people is neither fanatical and warlike nor willing to fail, but calm, firm and unshakable. The era of endless aggression has now ended. Foreign Secretary Halifax has explained the position of the British people in clear words. The British people support and welcome this warning. Once Britain has spoken, it will never go back. The British people love peace very much, but they have learned the lessons of brutal facts. The methods of force that have been used before are now showing signs of re-enactment. The only way for countries that wish to enjoy peace is to show their willingness to sacrifice what they most want to maintain in order to enjoy peace. The British people are now determined not to hesitate in the face of threats and not to give in to violence. (1st dispatch from Reuters)

(London) Liberal Party leader Sir Archibald Sinclair said at a Liberal Party rally near Bedford today that if anyone fights against Britain or against a country whose independence Britain guarantees, they will see that there is no one in Britain who is afraid of war. Britain's military equipment is formidable, and Britain's strength is infinite. The British people would rather resist than submit to violence. Munich has made peace difficult to maintain, so cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union is especially necessary. However, if Chamberlain does not step down one day, the firmness of Britain's purpose will never be believed by foreign countries. Therefore, he advocated reorganizing the government and recruiting Churchill and Eden into the cabinet. (1st dispatch from Reuters)

(London) Minister of Munitions Burgin said yesterday at the celebration meeting of the establishment of the unified government in Rothesay, Scotland, that "In 1939, a small part of the world's population of 200 million people wanted to intimidate and blackmail the entire civilized world, and the whole world has rejected this attitude. Britain and its empire are now joining hands with friends who speak the same language on the other side of the Atlantic, and represent a very large part of public opinion. Except for the small and weak countries that only want not to be involved in any whirlpool, the entire British Empire and the United States have been combined. We have now reorganized our military equipment, but not entirely for our own defense, but because the weak countries have discovered that the regimes they hate often use sweet words to achieve their ambitions of aggression and annexation. Burgin continued, "Anyone who plans to attack Britain is tantamount to signing his death certificate. Some people mistakenly believe that the peace group advocated by Britain is a encirclement. He now especially explains to the German men and women that Britain is not their enemy, but it can never listen to others' orders. We have the world's largest navy, the expansion of the air force has exceeded people's imagination, and we have a well-trained and mechanized army with the most modern weapons. In addition, there is a great national spirit that will never show weakness and be intimidated. Although we are determined to seek peace, we also have limited concessions to any external interference." (2nd dispatch from Reuters)

### French Wine Festival - President Lebrun Explains Determination - If the World Sees War Again, France Will Fight Resolutely - We Will Also Cooperate Sincerely with Those Who Maintain Peace

(Montpellier, France) Today is the "National Wine" festival. The local winemakers specially set up a grand banquet to entertain President Lebrun. Interior Minister Sarraut delivered a speech on the spot, saying that the independence of free nations in various provinces has been threatened. "French factories are working day and night to strengthen national defense. We must now have a firm national soul and an unshakable will to resolutely hold high the torch of freedom and continue to carry forward its destiny." President Lebrun then delivered a speech, the words of which roughly said, "If the world is hit by misfortune again and war is seen again, France will once again rise up to fight for freedom, justice and the rule of law, which is no different from what it did in 1914. When those who maintain civilization decide the country with destroyers, France has already made up its mind where to go. In essence, France will provide assistance to those who can cooperate internationally to maintain the rule of law, and will resist those who want to promote military politics and destroy the independence of small countries. We very much hope that all disputes between nations can be resolved peacefully. Peace is beneficial to mankind and is trusted by us, but for the sake of ensuring national security and fulfilling international commitments, sacrifices are necessary. At this point, if the nations of the world can be open and honest and hold a referendum, I know that the majority will agree with the democratic countries of Western Europe without a doubt. Premier Daladier once encouraged the people to "unite and wait in readiness." I would like to encourage you to share it. (2nd dispatch from Havas)

### Germany Denies Rumors

(Berlin) Foreign newspapers are filled with alarming rhetoric regarding the future of Danzig, but local people here are observing it with indifference and remain unmoved. There are rumors that Hitler will visit Danzig in early or late July and declare the annexation of the Free City of Danzig. Political circles here consider this unlikely. Furthermore, there are malicious rumors that many German soldiers have already infiltrated Danzig and will take some action on Saturday night or Sunday to make Poland feel that it cannot stand idly by, but also make intervention inconvenient. If there is any intervention, Poland will be placed in the position of an aggressor, and there will be no justification for its actions. In this way, Germany can hope that the British and French governments will not honor their promises to help Poland, etc. All these are unfounded rumors and not credible. The German General Newspaper solemnly declared last night that German political figures and the residents of Danzig are unconcerned about the spreading rumors. (Haitong Telegram, 1st)

### Poland Will Explain Its Position on Danzig

Warsaw – Polish Foreign Minister Beck received Chodacki, the Polish High Commissioner to Danzig, this afternoon. Chodacki came here from Danzig to report to the government on the state of military preparedness of the Danzig National Socialist Party. It is expected that they discussed sending a note to the Danzig Senate, requesting an explanation regarding the military deployments in the demilitarized zone. Well-informed sources do not believe that these deployments are a prelude to a sudden event, as British Foreign Secretary Halifax has already issued a warning, and Germany may not be willing to be the first to resort to arms. According to public opinion, Germany is currently employing a strategy of pinpricks, none of which can be considered serious enough to endanger Polish independence, but its aim is to gradually exclude Poland from the Free City and then present a fait accompli to Europe without resorting to war. However, Polish officials have repeatedly stated that Poland will never allow its rights in Danzig to be undermined. (Reuters Telegram, 1st)

Warsaw - Well-informed sources here recently declared that after the Free City of Danzig council took various military measures, a novel situation has been created. The Polish government is closely monitoring its development and will formally state its position at an appropriate time, which will not be far off. Political figures also stated that the measures taken by the Danzig City Council are illegal actions with provocative nature. The semi-official Iskra News Agency issued a message stating that Germany's intention is to force Poland to intervene, so that the world sees Poland as an aggressor. "This attempt will definitely fail. It must be known that if the current status of our country's territory on the Baltic Sea coast is to be changed in practice, whether in the Free City of Danzig or elsewhere, regardless of the method used, our country will immediately respond without reservation." The Times reported, "We are ready and believe that if Germany forces our country to fight, the Battle of Grunwald in 1410 will be reenacted today." (Havas Telegram, 1st)

### The King of England Reviews Serving Youth

(London) The King of England, accompanied by Queen Mary, reviewed 20,000 men and women in Hyde Park today, representing the two million people in the National Service Volunteer Corps.

In the morning, the King and Queen went to Westminster Abbey to offer prayers of gratitude for their safe return from Canada, Newfoundland, and the United States. The Cabinet was represented by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Inskip, and others.

### Anglo-French Diplomatic Activities Deny Warning Germany French Foreign Minister Meets German Ambassador, Both Sides Explain Attitudes Toward Poland

(Paris) German Ambassador to France, Welczek, has just returned to his post here from Berlin and met with Foreign Minister Bonnet yesterday afternoon (the first time in six weeks), informing him of his government's views on the European situation. Foreign Minister Bonnet also explained to him the attitude that France would take if Germany were to invade the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor. As for rumors that the British and French governments have issued a warning to Germany, stating that if Germany annexes the city of Danzig, Britain and France will not tolerate it, responsible figures here have denied this. They said that it is true that the British and French governments have been intensifying the exchange of views and have summoned their ambassadors to Poland back to their countries to report on their duties, but they have never made any representations to the German government, nor have they issued any warnings. The reason is that, as of now, Germany has not overtly interfered in the Danzig situation. The current tense situation is occurring within the city of Danzig. In this regard, if the Free City authorities do intend to declare annexation to Germany, then the counterparts of negotiations for the British and French governments will be the Free City authorities, not the German government. This is clear. (Havas Telegram, 2nd)

(Paris) Foreign Minister Bonnet received British Ambassador Sir Phipps today to discuss the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union and the general international situation. According to information received here, these negotiations are progressing smoothly, and the views of both sides are significantly closer than before. The date of completion should not be far off.

### Germany's Internal and External Arrangements for Danzig Proceed Simultaneously Old Ships Carry Guns and Ammunition East Prussia Repairs Bridges and Roads

Danzig - Although it has not been confirmed that German leader Hitler will visit Danzig at the end of July to personally receive the honorary citizenship of Danzig, which the city will present to him on his birthday, all preparations are now underway. The National Socialist Party's publication, the Danziger Post, criticized the British-French relationship in the Danzig situation, stating that Danzig must be returned to Germany, and when this will be realized will be decided by Hitler. The current arrangements seem to have presented Poland with the difficult problem of whether to preemptively strike or wait until the National Socialist Party completes its arrangements before acting. Although the National Socialist Party denies conducting military plans, information to the contrary is often leaked. National Socialist Party shipyards have been closed for two nights, and even night watchmen are not allowed to enter. It is reported that war materials are being landed there and transported away by trucks. German soldiers are often seen driving trucks openly through the city. A hotel opposite the railway station has been requisitioned as a military dormitory. Horses were requisitioned at the beginning of last week, and now various automobiles are being investigated. The owners of the cars have received notices to be ready for immediate requisition. The Elbing Road in East Prussia is strategically important and is now closed to private traffic for repairs. It is reported that bridge-building materials have been prepared to create a pontoon bridge at Los Buden within an hour to cross the Vistula River. Although rumors of currency devaluation have not been confirmed, they have not been denied, causing increasing anxiety in the business community. However, both the Poles and the National Socialist Party are now carefully avoiding open provocative incidents. The National Socialist Party is not yet prepared to take decisive action, and Poland is currently standing still. Yesterday, British newspapers were confiscated, as they wanted to keep the people from knowing the truth about foreign affairs. However, people from all walks of life now know that Germany's military actions in Danzig will inevitably lead to direct action from Britain and France. (Reuters Telegram, 2nd)

Warsaw - Various newspapers here recently continued to publish news stating that several old ships, fully loaded with guns and ammunition, were secretly transported from East Prussia, Germany, to the Port of Danzig to unload.

Warsaw - The Daily Pictorial here recently reported that, in addition to establishing a "Volunteer Corps" in the Free City of Danzig, a special border defense team has also been formed. In addition, 3,100 military blankets used by the Volunteer Corps were made by a factory in Upper Silesia Province, Poland, and this matter should be thoroughly investigated. (Havas Telegram, 2nd)

### German Cruiser to Visit Danzig Date in Late August

Warsaw - Responsible sources here recently confirmed that the German government has notified the Polish government that its cruiser "Königsberg" will arrive at the Port of Danzig in late August to hold a memorial service for the German cruiser "Magdeburg," which sank in the waters of the port during the European War. It is reported that the Polish government has not raised any objections to this matter. (Havas Telegram, 2nd)

Warsaw - Regarding the German cruiser "Königsberg" scheduled to sail to the Port of Danzig in late August, the general public here believes that it is not of great significance. In recent years, it has not been the first time that German warships have sailed to the Port of Danzig. In 1936, the German cruiser "Leipzig" sailed to the Port of Danzig. At that time, the captain of the ship only visited the authorities of the Free City and did not visit the High Commissioner of the League of Nations to the Free City of Danzig, which caused a dispute. Then, in 1937, six German mine-laying ships sailed to the Port of Danzig. The captains of each ship visited the Chairman of the City Council and the Polish High Commissioner, and also visited the High Commissioner of the League of Nations. This time, the "Königsberg" has precedents to follow. (Havas Telegram, 2nd)

### Germany Prepares to Build New Ships Supply Ships and Repair Ships

(London) The naval reporter of the Sunday Times claimed that, in view of the recent development of the German Navy, it is certain that Germany is now planning to prepare several supply ships and repair ships sailing at sea to compensate for its lack of overseas naval bases. These warships can be used as activity bases for submarines and small ships operating in the North Sea, and can enable them to operate for a long time after leaving the main base, and can also maximize the use of the ports of allied countries. The reporter also said that the German Navy's preparation for these supply ships has only recently begun. Because the German naval authorities have assigned this work to various shipyards, the construction of other warships will inevitably be delayed, so although several ships have been ordered, on the other hand, some merchant ships will be converted for application. According to reports, Germany currently has eight submarine supply ships and two motor torpedo boat supply ships, while the British Navy, whose mission covers the world, has only eight such supply ships that can sail at sea. A comparison of the two is worthy of attention. (Reuters Telegram, 2nd)

### Italian Newspapers Warn Britain and France Not to Cause Trouble and Start a War

(Rome) The Italian political magazine "International Relations" published an unsigned article today stating that Britain and France's attempt to maintain the status quo in Danzig will inevitably lead to a European war. The Axis powers will automatically use their military force to prevent the democratic countries from interfering in the Danzig issue. Italy will also take this opportunity to satisfy its demands on French territory. This article was clearly authorized by the government to warn Britain and France and Turkey not to get involved in Balkan affairs. (Reuters Telegram, 1st)

(Rome) The attitude taken by Britain and France towards the current international situation has recently been commented on by various newspapers here. They all said that the current policies of these countries are only aimed at intimidating Germany. However, the annexation of the Free City of Danzig to Germany is inevitable. This kind of intimidation is of no value. In addition, the titles used by the newspapers all fiercely attack the democratic countries of Britain and France, or say that the "anti-peace movement is developing," or say that "Britain and France are trying to prevent inevitable events, only to see their efforts wasted."

### Anglo-French-Soviet Negotiations Optimistic in London New Anglo-French Proposals Agreement Can Be Reached

(London) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, diplomatic circles here today expressed optimism. They all said that new proposals from Britain and France have been sent to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, and an agreement is expected to be reached quickly. The contents of the proposal have not been published. According to people close to the government, European countries whose territorial integrity and sovereign independence are of vital importance to the survival of one of the three countries, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, although their names are not listed, the nature of the proposal is quite broad and sufficient to deal with all situations. As for the details of the talks between the representatives of Britain and France and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at noon today, the official here strictly adhered to secrecy, but judging from the fact that the French Chargé d'Affaires in Britain had contacted officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs specializing in Eastern European affairs twice at noon and in the evening, it can be seen that Molotov may still have put forward some opinions on the new British and French proposals. Fortunately, the situation in Europe has recently become tense again, especially the Danzig issue. The negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have been affected and can be accelerated to reach an agreement as soon as possible. (Havas Telegram, 1st)

### Japanese Devastation of Chinese Fisheries

(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, since the Japanese announced the implementation of a blockade of the sea off Guangdong Province last September, Chinese fisheries have suffered 10,000 deaths and assets worth 20 million yuan due to the devastation of Japanese warships, including more than 1,000 fishing boats. It is reported that more than 30,000 fishermen are now unemployed and unable to make a living. Li Han-hun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, is paying close attention to this matter. It is reported that the provincial government has ordered fishermen to switch to agriculture or other occupations. If they still have to make a living by fishing, they should pay attention to avoiding Japanese warships to avoid being bombed. Although counties such as Zhongshan are very close to the sea, there are currently no marine fish for sale. (Reuters Telegram, 2nd)

### Impact of Japanese Blockade on Foreign Trade

(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesman today criticized the Japanese blockade of the southeastern coast of China, especially the operations in Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. These battles will not affect the import of weapons and ammunition into China, nor will they affect export activities, because since the military, China has stopped using the southeastern coast for these purposes. On the other hand, the Japanese blockade will affect foreign trade in China. (Reuters Telegram, 2nd)

### The Situation of the Chinese Army Withdrawing from Shantou City Taiwanese Ronin Provided Internal Support British and American Nationals Determined Not to Leave Shantou, Chenghai, and Anbu in Intense Fighting

Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese army began to invade Shantou City on the evening of the 20th. All military police teams mobilized to fight. By the morning of the 21st, before dawn, the rumbling sound of airplanes was already heard in the low sky. A total of forty-two airplanes, in groups of three or five, were scouting the suburbs of Shantou and bombing refugees who were fleeing, dropping bombs like rain. At this time, most of the fleeing people were bombed to death at Zhongshan Park and the Chenghai Road intersection. Those hiding in the shops were unharmed. A large aircraft, rarely seen in peacetime, scattered absurd leaflets in the sky and then landed in the port. Its length was equal to that of a ship, and it seemed to be manufactured in Germany. After the Japanese aircraft landed, the traitors in the city revealed their true colors and began to move in groups of five or six. The police security team and volunteer team were no longer seen in the city, but they all took off their uniforms, lay on the roofs, or hid in the ditches, holding firearms, preparing for everything. At about 8:00 in the morning, six traitors ran to the clock tower of the Customs Inspection Factory in front of the customs and raised the Japanese flag. Another Japanese flag was planted on the highest tower of the Central Hotel, and a flag was also planted in front of the city government gate by traitors. Another traitor was holding a flag and signaling at the China Merchants Bureau pier. Fifteen Japanese warships outside Mazi Island, along with more than twenty steamships and speedboats, rushed in like they were entering an unmanned territory. At this moment, the blockade had been broken, and they sailed into the Port of Shantou. The Japanese marines first used more than ten speedboats to sail to the Rong River and landed near Pengzhou, Dajing, with the aim of attacking Anbu and cutting off the retreat of the people of Shantou. As soon as the Japanese warships entered, gunshots rang out in the city, and fires broke out in two places. All the machines in the Jinshan Street power plant were destroyed by landmines, and the Tongji Bridge was blown up. The traitors all had white cloths wrapped around their right arms. They were all Taiwanese ronin who used to live in Shantou. They ran to the Jieyang Pier and saw five "Daba Jiang" boats parked there, loaded with bean cakes (each cake worth five yuan). They called on unemployed vagrants and hooligans in the shantytowns to move the bean cakes away. In less than half an hour, all the bean cakes were robbed. The Japanese speedboats towed the boats away and transferred cavalry ashore. At noon, the artillery fire became more urgent. Airplanes flew rumblingly over Shantou City and scattered leaflets again, limiting all merchants to open their shops within three days and resume business as usual.

After the Japanese army controlled the entire Shantou, the Chinese army was still near the Qilu Airport and at Stone Fort, Zhaoshagang, Zhaoshang Street, Wubridge, Xialing Port, and in front of the railway station, still fighting to the death with the few against the many. On the evening of the 21st, the sound of gunfire and artillery did not cease. On the 22nd, the Chinese army quietly withdrew after it was said that Anbu in the rear was attacked and occupied. At that time, the Japanese army, which had landed from Dahao, had reached Jiaoshi, and the Japanese cavalry landed at the end of Shenzhao Road in Qilu. The horses were produced in northern Mongolia, and there were about 300 cavalrymen who chased the Chinese army along the Hudi Road to Anbu Meixi. The Fukuda unit of the Marine Corps suffered considerable losses when landing at the Airport on the 21st. They were stationed at the Japanese Consulate, the Da Dong Ice Factory, the Dongying School, the Japanese Elementary School, the City Government, the Lingdong Commercial School, and along Waima Road to the Customs Inspection Factory. The Aodong Garrison Headquarters was established at the Chaozhou Customs. It was said that more than ten steamships and eleven Japanese warships were parked on the sea to protect the newly established headquarters. Sentries were placed in front of the Post Office at Juping Road intersection, Yongping Road intersection, and Yushan Street intersection, prohibiting pedestrians from entering or leaving. The sentries held pieces of paper with the words "No traffic allowed here" written on them. Pedestrians who were slightly suspicious were shot. The ferry boats to Jiaoshi were moved to the Xidi Tongjin Street intersection, allowing only people to cross over to Jiaoshi, and prohibiting people from Jiaoshi and the suburbs from entering Shantou City. All 300 foreigners were in Jiaoshi. The warehouses of European and American foreign firms in Shantou City have been closed since then. A certain automobile company had about 200 new cars being assembled in the factory on Zhongshan Road, which were completely confiscated by the Japanese army. There were also five foreign ships parked on the sea. The refugees hurriedly got on the ships, not able to bring much luggage. The fare was 40 yuan per person to escape Shantou. Japanese Navy Commander Kondo Akria issued a notice to the British and American consuls in Shantou, limiting foreign ships, foreign vessels, and foreign nationals to withdraw within 24 hours, otherwise he would not be responsible. British and American merchants had been doing business, preaching, and running schools in Shantou for nearly 70 years. Their rights and properties were countless. They expressed indignation at the ultimatum-like notice. They exchanged opinions in Jiaoshi and vowed not to retreat. In order to accommodate the situation, the British and American consuls additionally transferred two warships to Shantou and decided not to give in. Foreign ships also continued to come and go to Shantou as usual. However, whether passengers and goods can be freely loaded and unloaded after import is very questionable.

The important buildings in the city have been occupied by the Mauri and Tianshan units, among others. There are not many people. The personnel, horses, and artillery vehicles carried by the Japanese transport ships, after being sorted out ashore, set off one after another. Outside Mazi Island, there are more than 100 various types of ships parked, especially many rubber speedboats. It seems that they are focusing on the line of North and South Port Donglong, Zhanglin, and want to use the floating corps to drive up Chao'an. Now there is fierce fighting in Chenghai Anbu. The Chaozhou Yangjiaoshi area is very quiet. Only a few hundred Japanese troops are making a feint attack. On the 23rd, the fire in Shantou City was extinguished. About twenty shops were burned down in the Jinshan Street area. The Six County Guild Hall has now become a den of foxes and rats. Smuggling traitors have come forward to form a false local maintenance association, and Chen Juemin has been appointed as the false chairman. A false organization will soon appear.

### Western Newspaper Reports: Japanese Army's Anti-British Movement in North China - Beiping Residents Forced to Participate in Failed Demonstration

The "China Mail" Beiping correspondent reported on June 28th: In addition to blockading the British Concession in Tianjin and insulting the British there, the Japanese are now using Chinese newspapers under their strict control, along with posters, parades, rallies, and all other old methods, to incite anti-British sentiment throughout North China. So far, the Japanese efforts in this regard cannot be considered particularly successful. We still remember the intense and widespread anti-British demonstrations incited by the Communist Party and Kuomintang in 1925 and 1927. Currently, the attitude of the Chinese people towards this movement is

Completely Different

Clearly in contrast to the past, the people of Beiping were easily incited to participate in any anti-foreign demonstrations. However, in the current instance, they simply show no interest. The British should not flatter themselves and assume that the ordinary Chinese people do not participate in the current demonstrations because they love the British. The fact is that the people of Beiping dislike the Japanese even more than they dislike any other foreigners. This may surprise the Japanese. The experiences of the Chinese people under Japanese rule for two years have not inspired them to love the Japanese. The Japanese have used fraudulent tactics in the currency system, causing a sharp increase in the cost of living. The Japanese military police and the Chinese police controlled by the Japanese use oppressive measures. Even low-class Japanese people pour into Beiping, acting arrogantly and violently. Furthermore, the Japanese constantly regard themselves as conquerors. All of this has made it impossible for the Japanese to gain even a little goodwill from the people of North China. As a result, the Chinese are now suspicious and distrustful of anything the Japanese initiate. Moreover, in the past two years, the Japanese have engaged in so-called "voluntary" demonstrations, which, although numerous, have

All Ended in Failure

The Chinese are therefore tired of participating, so as not to continue making fools of themselves. The extensively publicized "All-China Anti-British Association" conference, held in the Forbidden City on June 23rd, is a clear example. The conference was a complete failure and became a laughingstock. From the beginning, the conference could not be called "voluntary," because only Chinese people with special red badges were allowed to attend. Foreigners had to be introduced and their business cards carefully examined before being allowed in. When reporters went to observe, they saw the usual groups of elementary school boys and girls and representatives, about a hundred flag bearers outside the venue, and no more than five hundred other attendees. People were constantly entering and leaving the venue, and no one seemed to pay any attention to the speeches. The speakers stood high on the platform behind microphones,

Speaking Incoherently

The place was far from where bombs could be thrown. Most of the audience wandered aimlessly in the square, while the schoolchildren roamed through the crowd, chasing each other for fun. The indifferent tone of the speakers was, of course, very different from the passionate and eloquent speeches of the anti-British rallies in 1925 and 1927. After the conference, a convoy of trucks carrying official participants drove through the main streets of Beiping, waving flags, shouting slogans, and distributing leaflets. These people showed ridiculous expressions of shyness. The overall impression of what the writers described as such a grand demonstration was only that the participants were indifferent,

Unwilling

The Chinese "hosting" this anti-British movement were people from the Chamber of Commerce, the Beiping Municipal Government, and Beiping educational institutions. It is not surprising that these people felt uneasy, because, as the reporter knows, some of them have indeed sent private letters to Chinese and foreign friends, saying that this action was actually contrary to their wishes. Because they were intimidated by the Japanese, they were forced to participate in this movement. Whether this is true or false, it is indeed a fact that those who are forced to engage in pro-Japanese propaganda and participate in political activities attract attention, and in this chaotic era, personal lives are often in danger. At the same time, Chinese newspapers in North China engage in fierce anti-British propaganda every day. These newspapers are all under strict Japanese control, so they cannot add their own opinions. Whether newspaper propaganda can be more successful than rallies and demonstrations remains to be seen in the future. So far, the entire movement has achieved something

The Opposite Result

The Chinese are now also secretly laughing at the Japanese, saying that because they cannot defeat General Chiang Kai-shek, they are trying to win a victory over Britain. This kind of talk that the Japanese are actually in a difficult situation was previously only heard among enlightened Chinese, but now it has spread among people of all levels.

### Japanese Army Stirring in Northern Anhui - Repelled by Chinese Army at Wuhe, Puppet of Sicheng Captured

Bengbu Dispatch: On the morning of the 18th, about two hundred Japanese soldiers in eight ironclad boats landed on the opposite bank of Wuhe from Linhuai Pass and attacked Shijiaxiang. They were surrounded by the Chinese army's XX Detachment. After several hours of fierce fighting, two Japanese soldiers were killed and six or seven wounded. Afterwards, under the cover of artillery fire, they retreated along the original river channel to Linhuai.

Gao Xiuzhang, chairman of the puppet maintenance association outside Xiguan in Sicheng and concurrently head of the puppet Sixian Police Bureau, has now been captured by the Chinese army and escorted to a certain place, ready for execution.

### Japanese Troops Invading Hainan Island Suffer Losses in Ambushes - Losses in Jiaji and Danxian, Japanese Air Force Harassing Guangdong and Guangxi from Hainan

Beihai Dispatch: On Hainan Island, except for the coastal counties that can be reached by roads, most other areas are mountainous and densely forested. If the Japanese army ventures deep, they are often in danger of being ambushed. For example, in the battle near Zhongyuan, near Jiaji, six or seven hundred Japanese soldiers and more than ten tanks were surrounded by the Chinese army. Along the way, they also hit landmines, destroying six tanks. The Japanese army suffered casualties of more than half. In the Danxian area, Dana City was once invaded by the Japanese army, but later the Chinese army sent hundreds of troops to besiege the city. The Japanese army in the city ran out of food. Although the Japanese army used airplanes to transport food to the city to supply them, the Northeast soldiers in the Japanese army had no intention of fighting and defected one after another. The Japanese army's supplies in the city suffered considerable losses. In early June, the Japanese army at Wanshan Ridge in Qiongshan County invaded Tengchaling. There were more than a thousand Chinese soldiers at the ridge. When the Japanese army advanced to nearby villages, they intended to occupy the high ground and set up artillery positions to strike the Chinese army from a distance. However, the Chinese army recognized that the time had come and launched attacks from different directions, eventually capturing most of the Japanese army and seizing many artillery pieces. The ports of Qiongya usually have many local products. Since the coastal areas were occupied by the Japanese army, the fishing industry in each port has fallen into the hands of the Japanese. Recently, hundreds of Japanese soldiers in Xingying Port have been watching a certain mine in Danxian County and once invaded the area. However, the mine had long been infiltrated by the Chinese army, and when the Japanese army arrived, they launched interception attacks from different directions. Many Japanese soldiers were killed and wounded, and they abandoned their guns and fled in a panic. In the Haikou area, there are about a thousand Japanese soldiers. According to statistics from all counties, there are no more than five thousand soldiers in total. Most of them are from the Northeast, Taiwan, or Korea. Having been stationed in a foreign land for a long time, they harbor war-weary thoughts. If the Japanese commanders force them to fight, riots often break out. The commander of the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army, Ando, believes that the morale of the Japanese army stationed in Hainan is declining, so he sent three Japanese judges, Setada and others, to Haikou to discuss countermeasures with the heads of the Japanese army stationed in Hainan.

The Japanese army, unable to make any progress in Hainan, is now instructing its subordinates to choose key points and hold them to the death, so that the air force can carry out so-called "sweeps" from the air. Therefore, in recent days, the Japanese side has been rushing to build huge airfields in Wenchang, Ding'an, and Chengmai counties, and more than a hundred aviation trainees have been transferred from Taiwan and assigned to various airfields to serve. This batch of aviation personnel has been practicing for several months, and accidents and crashes occur from time to time. However, this batch of personnel has gradually graduated and is quite familiar with the air routes to Gaolei, Qinlian, and other places, as well as the routes to invade Guizhou Province. In preparation for aggression, the Japanese air force headquarters recently transported dozens of bombers and fighters to supplement the airfields of Haikou and Weizhou Island. Since then, Japanese aircraft in the south have been conducting reconnaissance flights more frequently than in the past, or crossing the border to invade Guangxi. According to investigations, there are currently eighteen aircraft at the Chengmai Japanese airfield, twenty aircraft at the Haikou and Wenchang airfields, and nine aircraft at the Weizhou Island airfield. On June 6th, fifteen Japanese aircraft took off and split into two batches. One batch of eight aircraft entered Yongchun via Qinlian and flew to Nanning in Guizhou Province, dropping more than twenty bombs. Bombs landed in places such as Delin Road Special Zone, outside the North Gate of Nanning City, and Hejing, killing six or seven civilians. A steamboat on the riverbank north of the city was also hit by a bomb and destroyed. Another batch of eight Japanese aircraft detoured through Lianzhou and ravaged Guixian in Guizhou Province for about two hours before joining the group and heading out to sea through Qinlian. On the 9th, twelve Japanese aircraft flew to Leizhou and circled over Anpu, without dropping bombs, only conducting reconnaissance and secretly photographing the terrain. They did not leave for the sea until 4 p.m. On the 10th, another twenty-four Japanese aircraft took off from Haikou, passed through Xuwen in Leizhou, and along the Leizhou Strait to Lianjiang. They then split into two teams, one team of twelve aircraft passed through Liangyang, flew to Xijiang, and attacked Zhaoqing. The other team of twelve aircraft turned into Guizhou Province and bombed Nanning again. It was not until about 4 p.m. that the Japanese aircraft were seen flying through Lianjiang back to Hainan one after another.

### Xiangxi Garrison - Organized into Two Divisions to Participate in the War of Resistance - People of Twenty-One Counties Bid Farewell Separately, All Sectors of Yuanling Hold Flag Presentation Ceremony

Yuanling Dispatch: The Xiangxi area has always had a special regional situation, forming a traditional force. Since the Hunan Provincial Government actively developed it last year, national consciousness has generally developed in the local society. All the previously existing military forces have been completely unified through the collection and reorganization by Chen Quzhen, the director of the Xiangxi Pacification Office. Currently, they have been organized by the central government into XX Army, concentrated in XX for training, and participating in the second phase of the War of Resistance. Chen is the army commander, with Shen Jiucheng as his deputy. Dai Jitao and Long Yunfei are appointed as the commanders of the XX and XX divisions respectively. All the troops have been dispatched along the Xiangchuan and Xiangqian highways to designated locations for concentration. The people of twenty-one counties in Xiangxi held farewell ceremonies on the spot. On May 29th, all sectors of Yuanling held a flag presentation ceremony. More than a hundred representatives from the Third District Commissioner Wang Shi, County Magistrate Wang Qianheng, County Party Secretary Wu Xueyao, and various organizations jointly presented two embroidered flags. The two division commanders, Dai and Long, respectfully accepted the flags amidst the sounds of military music and firecrackers, and gave farewell speeches to the representatives, stating, "It is undeniable that the Xiangxi region has always been isolated from the central government. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the people have also been stirred by the high tide, and they have no hesitation in taking up arms to defend the country. We are willing to lead the brave soldiers of Xiangxi to fulfill our responsibility to defend the country and win glory for Xiangxi. We are determined to make XX also know that the people of Xiangxi cannot be insulted." The speeches were慷慨激昂, unprecedented. Currently, all the troops have arrived at designated locations for concentrated training. The Xiangxi Pacification Headquarters was abolished at the end of last month, and the defense was taken over by the central government's XX Army. As for the bandit troubles in various places, they were declared cleared a month ago, and local armed forces have also formed anti-Japanese self-defense groups, which are being trained separately. From now on, the impression of the Xiangxi Special Zone will never exist in the minds of the Chinese people, and Miao education is also being implemented in districts. Recently, the Miao people may also have the possibility of mobilizing.

### Decline of Guangdong's Silk Industry Under Japanese Control - Silk Merchants Subjected to Restraints and Suffering Heavy Losses, Now Closing Down One After Another Due to Inability to Maintain Operations

Hong Kong Dispatch: Guangdong silk is one of its special products. The most abundant production is in Shunde, followed by Nanhai, and then Panyu and Sanshui. More than ten years ago, during the heyday of the silk industry, the annual output was worth more than 20 million yuan. In Shunde County alone, there were more than eighty silk reeling factories, employing tens of thousands of silk reeling women. The mulberry, cocoon, and silkworm seed markets in the towns of Daliang, Rongqi, Guizhou, Leliu, and Longjiang were everywhere, making Shunde in its golden age. At that time, Guangdong silk was sold to the United States, with prices of more than a thousand yuan per hundred catties. Guangdong silk was of exquisite quality and smooth color, far superior to the products of Japan and Italy. Later, due to imperfect manufacturing methods and uneven fibers, it was gradually overwhelmed by Japanese raw silk in the American market. Afterwards, the invention of rayon had a major impact on the world silk market, and the impact on Guangdong silk was particularly significant. As the value of raw silk plummeted, those who planted mulberry trees and raised silkworms were unable to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, mulberry fields in various counties were mostly abandoned and used to grow other plants. The silk industry in Guangdong Province plummeted. In the past two or three years, the world raw silk market has recovered slightly. Although Guangdong silk has not been able to restore its former glory, it is not as bad as it was in the previous decade. A few months ago, Shunde fell, and silk merchants and silk reeling women fled one after another. The silk factories in Daliang and Ronggui all stopped operations. Recently, the Japanese army, which occupies Shunde, is trying to restore various industries and businesses in order to plunder resources on the spot for their own supplies. In particular, the silk industry is regarded by the Japanese as the largest part of foreign trade, so they pay special attention to it. As soon as the Japanese army occupied Daliang, they issued a notice to encourage the factories and silk merchants to resume business, with the Japanese army taking responsibility for protecting the start of silk reeling, as well as transportation and sales. The silk merchants were all concerned that there were rampant bandits in the inland, the order was chaotic, and the transportation was blocked and difficult. Most of them hesitated to move forward. Later, the Japanese army used coercive methods to intimidate the silk merchants, ordering them to reopen the silk reeling factories within a month, otherwise they would all be confiscated and confiscated. Under the lure and coercion of the Japanese army, in order to preserve their property, the silk merchants had to resume business with pain. Moreover, with the new cocoons coming on the market, the price was cheap, and they thought that resuming business by taking advantage of the opportunity would not be without great profits. Therefore, the first silk factories in Daliang and Ronggui to resume business were Guangjinglun, Lunchang, Daxing, Guangsheng, and Yuji. At that time, business was quite lively. Before long, the Guangzhou puppet organization's finance department raised funds from the silk factories, forcing them to pay self-defense group fees, self-defense fees, business taxes, and transportation protection fees. The names were cleverly established, and the exploitation was heavy. The silk merchants suffered, but there was nothing they could do. The daily output of each silk factory was quite abundant, and the exchange rate was high. In addition to paying various levies to the puppet organization and protection fees along the rivers, they could still make a small profit by shipping directly to Hong Kong for sale, which could also be done reluctantly. It is said that the Japanese believe that the silk industry in Guangdong Province can compete with the world silk market, so they have been plotting to seize it. Last month, Japanese merchants from Osaka, Kobe, Nagasaki, and Taiwan organized a South China Industrial Inspection Group to Guangdong. The name was to inspect various industries, but in fact, they hoped to seize the silk industry. As soon as the group arrived in Guangdong from Taiwan, the Guangzhou puppet organization first welcomed them and led them to the market towns of Daliang, Rongqi, Guizhou, Leliu, and Guanshan in Shunde to inspect the silk reeling factories and mulberry and cocoon markets. They investigated in detail the operating capital of each factory, the number of female workers, the output of raw silk, the business situation, and the types of machinery, made a list, and took it away. Before long, the Japanese army headquarters in Guangdong issued two orders: one was the order prohibiting the export of materials. In all areas under the control of the Japanese army, all industrial products, agricultural products, and various minerals, hardware, and appliances were not allowed to be privately exported and sold, and those who violated the order would be confiscated and severely punished. The second was the order to control the transportation and sale of raw silk. Silk merchants were not allowed to transport and sell privately. Raw silk produced in the areas occupied by the Japanese army was purchased by an agency specially established by the Japanese headquarters, and 600 military tickets were issued for every 100 catties. The current price of raw silk in Hong Kong is about 800 Hong Kong dollars per 100 catties. After the Japanese army took control, they bought it at a low price, packed it, and shipped it back to Taiwan and Japan on Japanese military ships, and then transferred it to Europe and the United States. The silk merchants knew that it would be very difficult to do business under the oppression of the Japanese and puppets. In addition, the puppet organization extracted heavily, and the costs were very high. However, by taking advantage of the high exchange rate in Hong Kong, they could still make a small profit if they could transport and export freely. However, once the Japanese army controlled and bought at a low price, not only was there no profit, but also losses. Therefore, there was no business to operate. In May, the silk merchants jointly used smuggling methods, colluding with the puppet organization's military police, and transported more than 500 dans of raw silk out of the occupied area by secret routes. When they sailed to the waters of Lingdingyang, they were unexpectedly detected by a Japanese patrol ship, intercepted, and escorted back to the naval headquarters for confiscation, worth more than 400,000 Hong Kong dollars. After this major loss, the factories in Daliang and Ronggui closed down one after another and ceased operations in June. There is a small amount of raw silk smuggled to central China, passing through the defense lines of the Chinese army for export. However, this route is also subject to customs inspection. According to regulations, for raw silk to be exported, foreign exchange must first be purchased at the National Bank, otherwise it cannot be exported. Currently, the silk industry in various counties in the occupied area is not only oppressed and plundered by the Japanese army, but also restricted by the customs. With so many restrictions, there is no opportunity to do business.

### Japanese Restriction on Foreign Ships to Shantou: British Ships Firmly Reject; Shanghai Japanese Consul-General Notifies Consular Corps Yesterday that Foreign Ships are Limited to One Entry per Week; Japanese Troops Attempt Another Landing at Yuhuan, Still Unsuccessful

The *North-China Daily News* reports that a Japanese naval spokesman stated yesterday (the 1st) while hosting newspaper reporters that the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Miura, notified the consular corps yesterday that the Japanese side would allow third-country ships to sail to Shantou once a week, provided that the Japanese Navy be notified 24 hours in advance. The Japanese authorities will only temporarily allow two types of items to be unloaded in Shantou to supply the people of third countries: food and mail. For nationals of various countries residing in Shantou, only one or two persons remain; the authorities have requested the relevant countries to deliver the mail of those persons via the ship sailing to Shantou once a week, or inquire whether the Yunnan, which set sail from Tianjin and is scheduled to arrive in Shantou on Saturday or Sunday, has arrived. The spokesman replied that he was seeking to receive this information, but if the ship had notified the Japanese authorities, it might have already been allowed to enter. He also stated that naval operations against Fuzhou had not yet ended, and that the evacuation of third-country nationals seemed to have been agreed upon locally.

**British Ships Insist on Continuing to Sail to Shantou**

In order to maintain navigation in Fujian and Guangdong, British firms Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson are dispatching the new Beijing from Shanghai to Quanzhou in Fujian. Ships sailing between Shanghai and Hong Kong will also serve Shantou in Guangdong. British ships departing from Shanghai include the Guangdong on the 4th, the Yosho on the 5th, the Kweesheng and Chengdu on the 7th, and the Kiungchow and Wosheng on the 8th. They are determined to reject Japanese obstruction. British warships are currently stationed in Shantou, Quanzhou, and other locations to protect the navigation of merchant ships.

**Fierce Battle at Yuhuan: Japanese Troops Fail**

According to news from shipping circles in this port, after the Japanese troops who landed on Yuhuan were reported to have been recaptured after a large number of reinforcements from the Chinese side arrived to counterattack, at around 3 p.m. on the 1st, five Japanese warships anchored off the coast of Yuhuan suddenly fired over forty shells at the shore, launching more than ten motorboats full of Japanese soldiers, attempting to land under cover of artillery fire. The Chinese army waited for the Japanese motorboats to approach before unleashing a fierce machine-gun barrage, engaging in a fierce battle. Ultimately, due to the Chinese army's thorough defense, the Japanese troops failed to succeed. On the morning of the 2nd, two more Japanese warships arrived and shelled the shore. Chinese losses were very minor.

**Japanese Planes and Warships Continue Bombing Zhejiang**

Japanese warships are now constantly launching motorboats to patrol, while the Chinese army remains on strict alert. (2) Six Japanese planes invaded Wenzhou and dropped bombs at around 7 a.m. on the 1st, dropping five or six bombs in Yueqing as well. (3) Two Japanese warships anchored off Chuanshan fired over ten shells at the shore at 9 a.m. on the 2nd. (4) Eight Japanese warships are currently anchored outside the Min River estuary, shelling Guantou on the morning of the 1st. The local defense forces also returned fire. It is reported that the merchant ship Kang Sha Yi, owned by Yi Chang Kang, returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou the day before yesterday and berthed that evening. When the ship passed the Yuhuan River, the Japanese warship inquired with flag signals but did not encounter any obstruction.

**Japanese Warships Reconnoitering Jiaojiang, Alert Raised**

According to news from shipping circles, five Japanese warships arrived at the port of Haimen in Zhejiang on the morning of the 1st, launching motorboats to patrol and reconnoiter along the coast, seemingly with intentions. However, the Haimen Jiaojiang estuary had already been blockaded by the authorities, prohibiting navigation, and heavy troops were stationed for defense. If the Japanese army attempts anything, it will definitely not succeed. It is also reported that the Zhejiang Provincial Military Affairs Bureau has issued orders to be on alert to prevent the Japanese army from launching surprise attacks in various coastal areas.

**Evacuations Continue in Fuzhou and Wenzhou**

A large number of Japanese warships are anchored off the coast of Fujian and Zhejiang. Apart from occasionally shelling the coast, there has been no concrete action. Elite Chinese troops are continuously arriving to deploy defenses, and the defenses are extremely tight. Currently, residents of Fuzhou and Wenzhou are being evacuated by the authorities, and the situation remains peaceful.

**Wenzhou Compatriots Negotiate to Send Ships**

The Wenzhou Association of Shanghai issues a public notice: "Since the situation has become serious and transportation between Oujiang and Shanghai has been disrupted, many of our Wenzhou compatriots may urgently want to return home to handle affairs, but they are suffering from a lack of means due to the interruption of shipping. In view of this, the Association has specially requested a certain shipping company to send ships to stop at Shacheng in order to facilitate travel back home. Compatriots who wish to return home should come to the Association to complete the registration procedures before 12 noon on July 3rd in order to negotiate future arrangements. Special notice." The Association's office is located at No. 10, 3rd Floor, Tianlun Building, Paocqiu Chang, Nanjing Road.

**Guangdong to Sail from Shanghai to Shacheng Tomorrow**

The British firm Butterfield & Swire has agreed to the request of the Wenzhou Association of Shanghai and has scheduled the Guangdong (2,626 gross tons, 1,572 net tons) to sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong on July 4th, also stopping at Shacheng in Fujian. Passengers going to Wenzhou can take this ship, disembarking at Shacheng, then take the road through Fen Shui Guan, Pingyang, and Ruian to Wenzhou. There is a highway from Fen Shui Guan to Wenzhou. Rumors that the ship will also call at Wenzhou are inaccurate. The ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Shantou today.

**Moufou Unloading Not Yet Completed**

The German firm Melchers & Co.'s Moufou, which sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 30th of last month, was blocked from entering after the Zhenhai estuary was blocked, and has been delayed for three days. The ship's passengers and cargo have been presented to the authorities for approval by the shipping company to arrange for unloading. A reporter from the New News Agency learned from the shipping company yesterday that the ship continued to unload remaining cargo yesterday and is expected to return to Shanghai today or tomorrow.

**New Beijing Arrives in Quanzhou**

The British firm Butterfield & Swire is maintaining its shipping rights in China and continuing to operate ships to various coastal ports as usual. The New Beijing sailed directly to Quanzhou in Fujian province on the morning of the 1st. According to a telegram received by the company, the journey was very peaceful and is scheduled to arrive this morning. However, the Chinese military authorities have prohibited all ships from entering or leaving Quanzhou, so it can only anchor outside the port, with passengers and cargo transferred by lighter.

**Shenhua Arrives in Shanghai, Shenai Arrives in Sanduao**

A reporter from the New Voice learned from a British firm yesterday: (1) The Shenhua, which returned to Shanghai from Wenzhou, arrived in Shanghai at 2 p.m. yesterday and berthed at buoys 30 and 31 in Yangshupu. (2) The Shenai telegraphed Shanghai, reporting that it had arrived safely in Sanduao after loading stones. (3) The Shenyou and Shenfu are temporarily berthed in Shanghai. (4) The Shenguang is still berthed in Chuanshan, with 1,400 tons of cargo still not unloaded. As for navigation between Shanghai and Min, there are currently no ships sailing because the situation in Fuzhou Chuanshan remains serious.

**Two British Ships Pass Shantou Without Entering Port**

The *North-China Daily News* reports that according to news received in Shanghai yesterday (the 1st), when the British ships Guangdong and Westistan anchored eight miles from Shantou on June 28, Shantou did not appear to be blockaded. Apart from one Japanese destroyer, no other Japanese warships were seen by the passengers of the two ships. However, the two ships were blocked off Sand Island by the British destroyer Searcher. According to the captain of the Searcher, he had received instructions to block British ships while negotiations between the British and Japanese authorities were still in progress. The wife and children of the Swedish consul in Shantou, who were passengers on the Guangdong, another Western woman, and an American passenger from the Westistan, all transferred to the British warship Searcher and went ashore in Shantou. Both ships had armed guards, four sailors each.

**British Naval Authorities Advise Leaving Shantou**

After being anchored off Sand Island for nearly eight hours, the ships were advised to leave Shantou by the British naval authorities, who stated that because negotiations were delayed, they would have to wait another 24 hours. The two ships left Shantou at 2 p.m. on the 28th. Although there were about 20 Japanese transport ships in the port of Shantou, passengers on foreign ships anchored off Sand Island did not see Shantou blockaded or Japanese naval patrols, only one destroyer and six armed motorboats. There was no air force activity, only one Japanese seaplane flying low over the port to Cape of Good Hope, fifteen miles south of Shantou. (Translated text) Public opinion believes that the British naval authorities did not want any unfortunate incidents to occur while negotiations were in progress, so they blocked British ships from entering the port.

### Hongqiao Sanatorium Borrowed for Jewish Children's Summer Camp

The buildings of the Hongqiao Tuberculosis Sanatorium, established by the Shanghai Municipal Council, have been empty for a long time. Now, an organization for the relief of Jewish refugees has borrowed them for a summer camp for Jewish refugee children. The camp's woodworking section is located on private property somewhere, but its buildings are insufficient, so it plans to borrow the empty buildings of the sanatorium. At a meeting on the 28th of last month, the Council Board decided to allow the organization to borrow them free of charge.

### Ministry of Finance Approves Filing, New Remittance System to be Implemented Tomorrow; Inspection Committee Formed, Increasing Market Funds; Eliminating Speculation, Stabilizing Shanghai's Financial Market

Shanghai's banking and money exchange industries have implemented a new remittance system to regulate interbank funds and supply commercial and industrial needs. This has been approved and filed by the Ministry of Finance. In the future, measures to eliminate speculation, stabilize the financial market, and concentrate bill exchange will be implemented simultaneously after a decision is made. Details are recorded as follows:

**Provide Guarantees to Obtain Remittance Allocation**

The banking and money exchange industries jointly decided to handle the allocation of new interbank remittances starting from July 4th. All banks and firms have provided property as collateral and registered with the Bank Union Reserve Committee. After the Committee has assessed the value and approved the allocation, it will transfer the interbank accounts of each bank and firm and issue checkbooks for use. These checks, which are the new remittances, are issued by each bank and firm with seals and signatures, and the Reserve Committee pays upon presentation of the checks. Holders of these new remittances can exchange them for remittance certificates from the Reserve Committee when necessary, which have the same effect as banknotes from the Silver Reserve Committee. Foreign banks have agreed to use them as collateral for clearing and have endorsed this new remittance system.

**Elect Committee Members to Form Inspection Committee**

A reporter from the New Voice learned from the Bank Reserve Committee yesterday that regarding the organization of the Interbank Remittance Reserve Inspection Committee for the banking and money exchange industries, after the Free Bank Reserve Committee sent letters requesting the nomination of committee members, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Money Exchange Industry Association, the Foreign Bankers' Association, and the four major Chinese banks (Central, China, Communications, and Agricultural) have all internally determined the candidates. The first committee meeting will be held after the nominations are reported, and its establishment will be announced. As for the date for inspecting remittance reserves, it is planned to be at the end of each month, and the types, amounts, and numbers of collateral pledged for interbank remittances will be announced separately to ensure credibility.

**Legal Tender Shortage Increases Remittance Allocation**

Shanghai's situation is unique. Although it has become an isolated island geographically, the influence of its financial power is still sufficient to influence part of China's financial situation. For example, international exchange rates are still centered in Shanghai. The Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that if legal tender were supplied as before to increase market funds, then too much legal tender would flow out and fall into the hands of unscrupulous people, which would only fuel speculation, has made every effort to tighten the supply of legal tender in Shanghai, such as restricting the carrying of legal tender to Shanghai and unifying the payment of various debts in Chongqing. In order to meet Shanghai's current needs, the banking and money exchange industries are implementing interbank remittance allocation, which is a good way to solve the problem of market funds.

**Ministry of Finance Approves Filing**

Regarding the new remittance system, the banking and money exchange industry association submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance, which has been approved and filed by the Ministry. According to a reporter from the New Voice who interviewed the banking and money exchange industry, remittances after 8/22 are different in nature from the previous remittances that were cashed the day after tomorrow. However, because legal tender is generally used in the market, and the large population of Shanghai requires legal tender for daily life, the remittances after 8/13 are not sufficient to meet Shanghai's current needs. After the new remittance system is implemented, it can be widely circulated and can also be used to remit funds to the interior to purchase local goods, so it can be said to be used in the same way as legal tender.

**Banking and Money Exchange Industries Centralize Exchange**

After the banking and money exchange industries decided to centralize the clearing house, the money industry reserve bank adopted a entrusted agency exchange method to participate in the banking clearing house. The library's 42 member money houses all entrust the money library to act as an agent. The banking clearing house specially set up booth number 50 (Spring) (that is, representing the money industry reserve library) for exchange, and the 42 member money houses represented by the library are listed as numbers 1 to 42. It is tentatively scheduled to be implemented from July 4. As for the original exchange of money industry, the exchange of bills of various money houses is still handled as usual, the time is from 1 pm to 2 pm every day.

**Second Step: Issuing Remittance Certificates**

According to a reporter from the New News Agency who interviewed the banking industry, the procedures for banks and money houses to receive and use remittances are: (1) The receiving banks and money houses first provide property as collateral. (2) The evaluation committee evaluates the price of the collateral. (3) The Bank Union Reserve Committee transfers the interbank remittance accounts of each bank and money house according to 70% of the price assessed by the evaluation committee, and issues checks for use. (4) All checks issued by the banks and money houses are paid by the Bank Reserve Committee. These checks are interbank remittances and can circulate in the market. However, in order to facilitate the transfer between industries, the Bank Reserve Committee will prepare to issue interbank remittance certificates in the second step and is currently drafting regulations, which will stipulate the amount and types of issuance.

**Suppress Premium to Eliminate Speculation**

After the Ministry of Finance's Ma Telegram restriction on withdrawals and the banking and money exchange industries' measures to stabilize the market are implemented, Shanghai's financial market will become more stable in the future, which can (1) eliminate the speculative boom in the Shanghai market and stabilize the market; (2) encourage the transfer of funds inland and strengthen the foundation for resistance. The premium on remittance bills may disappear on its own in the future. In addition, a reporter from the New Voice learned from the Money Exchange Industry Association yesterday that the number of money exchange houses in Shanghai has surged after the war. Many have joined as members of the Association, but there are also many who are unable to join or have not joined. Most of the money exchange houses that operate remittance premiums are not members of the Association. The Association has advised its members to pay attention to this remittance premium in order to avoid fueling speculation.

**Market Stabilization Restores Normalcy**

After the new remittance system is implemented, Shanghai's market will increase new funds, enabling all industries to no longer feel a lack of funds. Therefore, markets such as securities, grains, flour, yarn, beans, rice, sugar, and northern and southern goods will all open on the 3rd or 4th. Due to the increased funds, market transactions are gradually returning to normal. In addition, the rumors of new circulating notes in Shanghai in the past week have been confirmed by all parties as inaccurate, because under China's current legal tender policy, which is extremely stable, there is no need for them, and the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, and instead cause market fluctuations.

### French Concession Health Department Actively Prevents Epidemics; Forcibly Injects the Public, Starting from the First District

The weather has been alternately cold and hot in recent days, so various seasonal epidemics are emerging and the numbers are increasing sharply, especially typhoid fever and cholera. Although the health departments of the two concessions have notified citizens to go to the various health departments to receive epidemic prevention injections, the general public often avoids them. For this reason, the French Concession Health Department has had to take decisive measures, dispatching a large number of personnel, together with the police, to the first district (i.e., the Bund to Avenue Foch, Avenue Edward VII to the boundary of the Puyuan Chinese district) to forcibly inject the public along the way to ensure the safety and health of citizens. This work will continue until all citizens have been injected, and then will proceed to other districts.

### Silver and Money Industry Friendship Association Charity Sale Opens; Mrs. Sun Ruihuang Cuts the Ribbon, Scene at the Venue is Extremely Lively

The Silver and Money Industry Friendship Association of this city held a charity sale of national goods to aid the disaster. The opening ceremony began at 9 am yesterday. Lin Kanghou, Sun Ruihuang, Pan Yangyao, and other members of the presidium, as well as more than 200 people from the silver and money industry, arrived. First, Sun Ruihuang gave an opening speech, and Lin Kanghou and Pan Yangyao gave instruction speeches. Mrs. Sun Ruihuang, Huang Guoxiu, performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony, and then visited the venue. The scene was extremely crowded. In just one hour, more than 500 yuan were sold. It is reported that the association has changed the duration of the event to two days of charity sales in advance.

### Lu Ying Assassination Case Involves Coolies; Japanese and Puppet Police Conduct Extensive Searches, Accusing Suspects and Detaining them for Interrogation

The puppet "Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Chief" Lu Ying, on the other day, took his own car from his residence in Hongkou to the puppet "Bureau" in the central area of the city to handle official business. When the car drove to near the Maojiazhai on Qimei Road (now renamed Matsui Road), it was suddenly ambushed by seven or eight people lurking in the weeds on both sides of the road, who jumped out and attacked Lu's car with pistols. Because the driver was alert and accelerated, speeding away, they managed to escape. After the incident, the Japanese and puppet police mobilized everywhere and conducted extensive searches, searching house by house in the areas of Gongmei Road, Baoan Road, and Linping Road, causing residents to feel uneasy. On the other day, several coolies of Jiangbei origin, including a Zhang, who lived in a corrugated iron shed on Miaohou Road, were arrested and interrogated, accused of being involved in the Lu assassination.

### After the Fall of Dinghai City; Chinese Troops Firmly Defend the Suburbs of Wangcheng; Counterattacked All Night That Evening, Both Sides Suffered Casualties; Battles at Baiquan, Dazhan, Qingling, and Baihushan

Since Dinghai was landed on by Japanese troops on the 23rd of last month, the battle is now still unfolding in areas of Baiquan, Qingling, and Baihushan, Dazhan. Here are the continued circumstances recorded:

**Prisoners Released**

After the Japanese troops landed three times at Shenjiamen, Yancang Road, and Daotou, the situation inside Dinghai City became very urgent. In addition to ordering the police force to quickly resist, County Magistrate Su also issued an order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, ordering Director Lu of the prison bureau to release all new prisoners in the county prison and detention center in order to avoid injuring the innocent.

**Investigation of Civilian Casualties**

He Asheng, a farmer from beside the Tanshudian Temple outside the East Gate of Dinghai County, carried firewood into the city to sell on the 23rd. On the way, when passing the Tongsoutai Wine Shop on the Xinqiao Bridge in the East Gate, he suddenly encountered several Japanese soldiers who, without asking about the situation, shot him in the neck, causing him to bleed profusely. His life is not in danger. In addition, Gao Liangcai (23 years old), a member of the wartime political work team, was shot and broke his left arm while on communications duty, passing through Japanese military defense area. He has now been transported to an island for medical treatment. In addition, there are four or five unnamed men and women who were injured by stray bullets and sought treatment at the Catholic Church Hospital.

**Japanese Troops Weary of Fighting**

After our army retreated in tears to the suburbs of Wangcheng on that day, they began to counterattack at 12 o'clock that evening. On the North Gate side, it was led by Zhang Fucheng, the first battalion commander of the Resistance and Defense Team, and the West Gate was personally commanded by County Magistrate Su. We used machine guns and grenades to attack the Japanese soldiers in the city, and the Japanese army responded with machine guns and small steel cannons. The fierce battle lasted all night, and the sound of gunfire was endless. The local armed civilians' volunteer police force and police officers also participated in the battle. It only stopped at 5:00 am at dawn. Both sides suffered casualties. There are still battles in Baiquan, Dazhan, Qingling, Baihushan, and other places. The Japanese army has not been able to rest and will soon be weary of running around.

### French Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; French Consul-General and Others Go to Wharf to Welcome; Also Sent a Team of French Soldiers to Protect Along the Way

The French Ambassador to China, Cosme, arrived in Shanghai on the 30th of last month, taking the President Cleveland of the American President Lines. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 12:30 pm yesterday, berthing at buoys 12 and 13 in Yangshupu. The French Ambassador took a special ship from the Jianghai Customs and arrived at the New

### Chen Guangzong and Jiang Hechang to Regain Freedom; No Political Suspicion Found

Chen Guangzong (former chief of the first section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau), director of the Datong Business Company on the upper floor of the Guangdong Bank at 353 Kiangse Road in the Public Concession, and Jiang Hechang, the chairman of the company from Ningbo, were arrested at 11 am on the 9th of last month by five plainclothes Japanese agents, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the police station. At that time, the Japanese side accused Chen and Jiang of political activities in Shanghai, but after a thorough investigation by the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, they were confirmed to be legitimate businessmen with no political activities and no criminal behavior. Therefore, Chen and Jiang were treated with great courtesy, but the Japanese side repeatedly requested extradition to be taken for questioning. As a result, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department approved their transfer to the Japanese side on Monday of last week for investigation at the Japanese Military Police Headquarters in the Waitan Water Hotel. It is now known that the Japanese side has completed the investigation and found that Chen and Jiang are innocent, so they were sent back to the Police Department on the 30th of last month. At that time, the office staff had already left, so they were released by the police authorities at 12 noon on the other day and regained their freedom.

### Unceasing Drizzle All Day; Vegetable Transportation to Shanghai Sharply Reduced; Vendors Use This as an Excuse to Increase Prices, Ordinary People Suffer Greatly

In Shanghai, due to the unceasing drizzle these days, the soil is muddy and slippery, and those who make a living by transporting vegetables dare not move forward. In addition, local taxes are heavy and inspections are strict. The quantity of various vegetables transported to Shanghai has been sharply reduced. Although local goods stores have tried to purchase them to meet market sales, they have ultimately not been able to increase the source due to transportation difficulties. According to news from local goods stores yesterday, the market in Shanghai for these goods has increased sharply since the outbreak of the 8/13 war due to the concentration of population and the increase in sales. Therefore, after the source is scarce, the inventory has been reduced, and the market price has risen. Those who eat vegetables are the most affected. They are advised to purchase them from the place of production as soon as possible to meet market sales. At a time when all prices are rising, the livelihood of ordinary people is becoming more difficult. Although they have already saved on expenses, their income is small, and they are truly unable to make ends meet.

### Japanese Warships Harass Beisha; Warfare is in Progress; Garrison Troops Calmly Respond to Japanese Landing Attempts, Foiled

According to shipping industry sources, Japanese warships and motorboats are daily shelling the various ports of Beisha. The Chinese army calmly responds, and Japanese attempts to land have been foiled. However, Japanese warships continue their harassment. At night, they dare not anchor in the sea areas of these ports, but instead sail back to anchor outside Qinglong Port. The Chinese troops stationed at each port have strengthened their defenses and are on high alert to ensure safety. The local situation is as calm as usual, and the people are also very calm. Passenger ships to and from Shanghai and Beisha continue to operate as scheduled, but cannot directly reach Shanggang.

Foreign Ships Continue to Sail to Qinglong Port

Since the Japanese navy has been obstructing foreign ships from sailing the Beisha route, the Jianghai Customs has agreed to the Japanese request, refusing to clear ships to and from Haimen and Qidong. Therefore, ships sailing the Beisha route have changed to Qinglong Port for customs clearance and continue to dispatch ships. Currently, except for the British Swire Company's Wanto, which is temporarily suspended, and the Portuguese Deya, represented by the Italian Yihua Shipping Company, which is undergoing repairs, other ships, such as the British Jardine Matheson's Yihe, the German Hende Lisha Jiangding Haiyi, and others, are operating as usual. Their customs clearance location is Qinglong Port.

Temporary Docking at Various Ports in Shanggang

As for Xin Port, Lingdian Port, Sanhe Port, and Dong No. 1 Port, they have temporarily suspended docking due to Japanese notification of obstruction of navigation. However, whether Huxun Port, Niuhong Port, Shuji Port, Songji Port, and Lao Hong Port, Jian Bay will be docked is yet to be determined. If there is no Japanese warship obstruction upon arrival at these locations, they will continue to dock as usual. Otherwise, they will also temporarily suspend docking. Due to the Japanese obstruction, the business of each ship has declined daily, and there are very few passengers and goods.

### City Federation Requests Improvement of Sanitation on North Fujian Road

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Public Works Department's Sanitation Department yesterday, stating: "Regarding the previous letter from the 37th District Branch of the Federation, stating that due to the numerous night soil carts passing through North Fujian Road from morning to noon, many of which are broken and leaking, hindering sanitation, the Federation requested three points from the Public Works Department's Sanitation Department: (1) Disperse the night soil carts to avoid excessive concentration on the road; (2) Shorten the passing time; (3) Ban broken and leaking vehicles. It has been a long time since the request was made, and it has not been implemented. At this time of scorching heat, it is very likely to cause epidemics. Therefore, we specially request your department to forward the letter to the Public Works Department's Sanitation Department for prompt improvement, etc. Upon investigation, the broken and leaking night soil carts on North Fujian Road and the excessive passing time have caused great suffering to the citizens on the road, which is indeed the truth. Accordingly, we request your department to consider the importance of public health and promptly improve the situation, and we hope that more water sprinkler vehicles will be dispatched to spray on the road to clean the streets and emphasize sanitation."

### Japanese Soldiers Open Fire in Suzhou Creek, Wounding Boatman

The Mainland News reports that Dong Jiyao, a 25-year-old Ningbo boatman hired by Yitaixing Coal in Xinza Road, was rowing a small boat to the mouth of the Suzhou Creek at 1:30 PM yesterday (the 1st) when he arrived east of the Waibaidu Bridge. Suddenly, a motorboat carrying Japanese soldiers approached. One of them fired a shot from a rifle, hitting Dong's right arm. The reason is unknown. Dong tried to land on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek and asked a Chinese policeman for help. He was first taken to the Central Police Station and then rushed to Renji Hospital. It is reported that his injuries were satisfactory last night. It is believed that the Japanese motorboat was trying to navigate the crowded waterway, and Dong was slow to give way, provoking the anger of a Japanese soldier, who then fired a shot.

### Gunshots Ring Out in Zhuanbang, Western Shanghai; Reason Unknown

In a certain lane in Zhuanbang, Western Shanghai, a shooting incident occurred at around 4:00 PM yesterday. Upon receiving the news, the public concession police authorities dispatched armed detectives in patrol cars to be on guard because the area is a road-building area beyond the concession. When the police arrived, gunshots rang out again, lasting for a long time before ceasing. Whether there were any injuries is still under investigation. It is reported that there is a Heli gambling den in the area. The reason for the shooting is difficult to determine at this time.

### Enhanced Security in Chapei, Western Shanghai

Recently, security has been tightened at the borders between the Chinese areas and the concession areas of the city. Pedestrians passing through the entrances and exits of Hongqiao Road and Daxi Road in Western Shanghai are required to present passes and epidemic prevention certificates, and the items they carry must be thoroughly inspected. At the railway crossing of North Xinjing and Caojiadu, passage is not allowed without a pass from the local military police headquarters. The family return permit issued by the Japanese Naval Landing Forces Headquarters is only valid for travel within the areas of Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Zhabei. Security at the Mint Bridge was also tightened yesterday. Pedestrians are not allowed to carry items. The Xinza Bridge only allows items to be carried from the concession to Zhabei, and not from Zhabei to the concession. Pedestrians are subject to individual inspection. Part of the traffic on Wuzhen Road Bridge is still allowed. Inspection of pedestrians on Sichuan Road Bridge and Waibaidu Bridge is also stricter than usual.

### Dr. Paterson (Part 1) - The Three Difficulties of Renji Hospital

— EL

"To be honest with you, I'm very sorry," Dr. Paterson lowered his voice and said to me, "In the last seven years, I can't remember taking a single portrait except for taking a group photo in the state funeral." These were the words spoken to me frankly and humbly by Dr. Paterson, the president of Renji Hospital, when I asked him for a photo before leaving after my visit, as he flipped through a photo album.

Anyone who has seen Dr. Paterson (Dr. J. Lee H. Paterson, M.B., Ch.B.) before or recently—and there are probably many people in Shanghai who know him. Moreover, it is not necessary to be sick to have the opportunity to meet him. For example, the nursing students who have graduated from the nursing school attached to Renji Hospital are not among the patients—can always remember what kind of person he is. At least, they have a respectable, friendly, and responsible impression of the white coat worn by doctors, which represents his noble profession.

Stepping onto Shandong Road (going south)—the foreign cemetery adorned with broken monuments and remnants of the old garden; the Shen Bao, founded in the eleventh year of Tongzhi, with a daily circulation of 150,000 copies; and the Lester Chinese Hospital (Renji Hospital) in Maijiaquan, Shanghai's oldest and second-largest, run by the Christian Church—one of the three "old" things, I couldn't help but feel very grateful: I was neither "sent in"—which is almost a daily occurrence in the local news—nor "visiting"—I went at 2:30 PM, which is when everyone visits their sick relatives and friends—but "visiting" President Paterson in the white coat.

…Inquiry desk, registration desk, accounting office, dispensary, operating room…doctors, nurses, hospital staff…newly recovered patients leaning on crutches and walking, patients with extreme pain covering their heads with bedsheets and coming for treatment, seriously ill patients lying on stretchers being pushed into elevators and going up…Isn't that Dr. Paterson over there!

Under the armpit of his left arm, which had a red background with three white-letter LCH armbands, he was holding a board with the patient's medical records on it, and he was busy talking to a staff member. The pencil in his right hand was constantly poking at the record paper; in the middle of their conversation, he either used the tip of the pen to write or gently and rhythmically tapped the record paper with the tip of the pen. It seemed that all the surrounding disturbances had been conquered by order, training, and experience.

"Ah, Mr. S, please come this way," Dr. Paterson led me into the president's office on the second floor.

Simplicity and rusticity are intertwined in this room, which is neither large nor small. While Dr. Paterson was making a phone call, I looked around and felt that it could not be simpler. In the center was a large desk with some stationery, a telephone, an ashtray, and some books; near the window was a small desk with several books, one of which was open—undoubtedly a foreign "spiritual essence" or something similar; on the four walls hung seven or eight landscape photos of various sizes, which were also simple and not heavily colored; in addition, there were one or two bookcases, several chairs, and one washbasin.

Doctors' time is like a young girl's spring, so we skipped the pleasantries and started talking:

"I was born on May 15, 1884, and I am 54 years old this year."

"I first entered Condall Middle School, then entered Rutherford College (Dr. Paterson explained to me that it was in Newcastle-on-Tyne—Tyne is the name of the river, he said). I graduated from the University of Edinburgh in 1906 with an M.B., Ch.B. degree."

"I married Miss C.M. Brown in 1912."

"I usually like to play tennis, and I used to play hockey."

I asked Dr. Paterson about his date of birth, education, marriage, and sports in order.

"Then, in what year did you come to China, sir?"

"In February 1908," Dr. Paterson replied, "I worked at this hospital from 1908 to 1910; in Wuchang from 1910 to 1912; and in Zao City, Tianmen, from 1912 to 1926. During the Great War from 1916 to 1919, I returned to my country and served in the Royal Army Medical Corps (R.A.M.C.); I returned to Shanghai in 1927."

Indeed, Dr. Paterson has a long history with Renji Hospital. Because after returning to China in 1927, he succeeded Dr. Davenport as the president of the hospital, and has been in that position ever since.

After ten minutes of conversation, I had almost obtained a rough outline of Dr. Paterson's past. During the pauses in our conversation, I silently observed the person being interviewed sitting across from me. He had a deep and resolute attitude and a bright spirit; his rich and rosy face was set off by a pair of bright eyes, and his head was covered with hair that was half silver-gray and half brown silk; during the conversation, he would occasionally lean back in his chair, revealing a broad and generous mind from his peaceful and natural laughter.

"Dr. Paterson," I asked, "What is the most difficult thing you have felt in managing the hospital for so many years?"

"Difficult?" Dr. Paterson replied, "Too many patients, too little space, and not enough money… those are the few difficult problems to solve."

From the "three difficulties" mentioned by Dr. Paterson, he provided me with several numbers. He said that in terms of patients, the number of outpatients at Renji Hospital averages between 800 and 1,200 per day; the number of inpatients is between 280 and 300. Currently, because everything is expensive, especially affected by the soaring exchange rate, the expenditure on medicines is particularly considerable.

As if talking to Dr. Paterson about the seven daily necessities, the wrinkles on his forehead inevitably tightened gradually. I then asked, "On average, how much does it cost to maintain one inpatient per day?"

"About 2.6 yuan per day," Dr. Paterson said slowly, "including all expenses, even the doctor's service fee."

If an average patient has to pay 2.6 yuan per day for medical expenses, wouldn't that be 78 yuan per month? This would become a very serious problem for families below the middle class, who are at the salary level.

"Then is it completely free?"

"In terms of percentage, free patients account for 45%; those who pay only 6 cents per day account for 40%; in addition, those who can pay 1 to 3 yuan or more than 3 yuan per day account for 15%," Dr. Paterson replied.

"So, nearly half of the patients can't afford their own medical expenses," I said.

"That's what I'm saying," Dr. Paterson said as he stood up and took two annual reports of Renji Hospital from 1937 and 1938 from the bookshelf to show me.

The entire working performance of the hospital and its economic situation are included in this 40-page report. According to a paragraph in the report by Sir Marshall, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, when he served as chairman at the annual meeting of Renji Hospital in mid-April this year, "Expenditures on almost every item under the regular account have increased; however, due to the careful and cautious management, the increase in this ratio is not as great as the increase in the income ratio. As a result, the expenditure exceeds the income by less than 2,500 yuan…"

It is certainly not an easy task for such a large hospital to have such achievements in terms of regular income and expenditure. According to Dr. Paterson, because the hospital has some property, it can barely manage to get by in terms of regular expenses. However, temporary expansion expenses are impossible to come by for the time being.

"Because there are too many patients and the location is too small, we very much hope to add a floor on the roof," Dr. Paterson pointed upwards at the house outside and said, "But the estimated cost is at least 25,000 yuan. Not only is the money unavailable, but we also need to purchase equipment and the usual maintenance costs." Speaking of this, he couldn't help but look at me with an unavoidable "bitter" smile for a moment.

We took the opportunity to end the question about the word "difficult." (To be continued)

### Foreign Concessions in China Must Establish a Common Front to Cope with Japanese Danger; Concessions Affect All Trade; Japanese Demands are Endless

The China Weekly Review states that the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin and the Gulangyu concession, the isolation of the French concession and other special zones in Hankou and the Shamian concession, and the Japanese pressure on the Shanghai Municipal Council have made everyone familiar with the true situation in the Far East. The Western concessions in China are all encountering a common danger, and Japanese pressure is rapidly infringing on Western rights and interests. Although the Japanese actions against these special zones vary in motive, and the methods of oppression in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Hankou, and Gulangyu are also slightly different, there is no doubt that militarist Japan has engaged in a

Huge Movement of Encirclement, Isolation, Boycott, Blockade, and Economic Severance

against all non-Japanese concessions in China. All Westerners are now in the same boat. There is no longer any illusion about the possibility of permanent arrangements with Japan regarding these special zones. Japan's attitude on this point has fundamentally changed. Even after the start of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan still enthusiastically supported the existence of concessions in China, whether they were Japanese concessions or not. Tokyo still used these areas as arrowheads to invade China. However, the current situation is completely different. The concessions are all in Japanese-occupied areas and are used as bases for opposing the concessions. Japan no longer regards the concessions as its own convenient "springboards," but as gateways for others to invade its occupied territories. Closing these gateways has become Japan's established policy. This policy has been repeatedly stated by the current Japanese Foreign Minister. In the name of the various puppet governments established by Japan in China, Japan demands the so-called "return" of the concessions. This demand has not yet taken the form of a real demand and has been formally submitted to the relevant Western powers, but it is expected to be submitted in the near future. Japan's current "purification war" against the special zones is preparing to

Strike the Final Blow

when it realizes its plan to weaken Western resistance one day.

Since Japan has this policy, there is little or no possibility of compromise. Painful experience has shown that every gain Japan makes from the concessions is followed by more demands, and there is no end to them. It is now repeatedly creating pretexts to take actions to reduce the independence of the special zones. No matter what concessions the concession management authorities make to Japan, the Japanese militarists will regard each new benefit as a stepping stone to achieve their ultimate goal of abolishing foreign-managed special zones in China. The Western powers have considered the final return of concessions in China more than once, but what they have considered is only the return to an independent Chinese national government. No

Western Power

has ever considered transferring its rights in special zones in China to non-Chinese powers, especially not to Japan. "Returning" the concessions to the puppet regimes created by Japan is no different from ceding them to Japan. These puppet regimes are entirely controlled by Japan and have fully proven that they are merely tools in Japan's hands for anti-Western discrimination.

Transferring the concessions to these regimes would cause great losses to American and European commercial interests in China. Japan itself may abandon its concessions in Tianjin and Hankou, because the entire

Japanese-Occupied Area

is already like a large Japanese concession. However, Westerners cannot do this. Their concession rights have now become the main rights to continue commerce in Japanese-controlled areas. However, although Japan is clamoring for the return of the concessions to China, the Japanese militarists have taken no action to hand over their concessions to the puppet regimes. This point is worthy of attention. The entire trading position of the Western countries is largely dependent on the continued existence of their concessions, so there is a close relationship between the two. This is especially true for the public and French concessions in Shanghai and the British and French concessions in Tianjin. According to trade statistics, the

Commercial Transactions

in these two ports have declined less than in ports entirely controlled by Japan, largely because of the existence of concessions in these two cities. In the first four months of this year, Chinese imports traded through Shanghai and Tianjin accounted for nearly 80% of the total. Of these imports, Shanghai accounted for no less than 46.76% and Tianjin accounted for 27.4%. More than 90% of the goods imported by Western countries into the Japanese-occupied areas enter China through Shanghai and Tianjin. The reason why these imports can be maintained is that there are concessions in Shanghai and Tianjin, which maintain an independent and open money market where foreign exchange can be freely purchased to pay for imported goods. If these circumstances change, the trade in Shanghai and Tianjin will be destroyed. If the public and French concessions are

Once Abolished

what will happen to Western commerce in Shanghai can be imagined. At that time, the entire city will become a "Greater Zhabei," where Japan dominates everything. "Permission, licensing, banning, and control" will emerge one after another. Exporters will have to obtain foreign exchange according to the arbitrary and fictitious exchange rate set by the Yokohama Specie Bank, and importers' foreign exchange will have to be determined according to the bank's opinion. Western ships in the Huangpu River will encounter the same situation as in Qingdao. We will only use the "Hongkou Bridge" or the Japanese yen. Our mail will be subject to strict inspection, and overseas mail will be

Newspapers and Books

will be detained, and the Nanjing puppet government will tax everyone. No one is unaware of the danger, but what is the countermeasure? Have those who can do anything done their best? There is no room for argument that foreign concessions and their residents are in the same boat. But have they cooperated to the extent required by the situation? The answer is no. If these areas had cooperated closely from the beginning of the war and dealt with Japan with a firm and common policy, everything could have been properly handled by now. Unfortunately, the opportunity has been missed, and it is too late to regret. However, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Gulangyu still maintain a position where they can offer united resistance, rather than just passively endure suffering. The administrative organs of these concessions should

Cooperate Closely

in terms of mutual communication, exchange of opinions, and mutual assistance. Even today, what should be done is not limited to this. When facing a common danger, they should unite, resist and manage together, and make the closest possible cooperation without delay. In recent weeks, Western diplomats in the Far East have established some direct contacts and cooperation between the aforementioned special zones, but this is by no means sufficient. Western diplomats must implement the instructions received from their respective governments, but their governments' policies towards the concessions are often passive, and the policies that diplomats are required to follow do not seem to be based on the interests of the concessions. From this point of view,

The Concessions in China

must have closer cooperation. Their interests urgently require the establishment of a common front to resolutely deal with the dangers of Japan and the policies of their respective governments. If there were a group of people today, whether in an official or non-official position, who could be generally regarded as the spokespersons for all special zones in China, their united statements, resolutions, and actions would have more influence on Japan and the Western home governments than the passive complaints of Western merchants in the special zones. If this group of people has a good position, influence, and independence, it will certainly be able to

Preserve

the interests of the threatened Westerners in China, especially in the concessions, and obtain the cooperation of similar interests outside of China. The Western interests in the British colony of the Philippines and Vietnam will also express sympathy, because they will also encounter the threat of Japan. This may not be the case at present, but once Japan tries to destroy the Western special zones in China, the Western interests in the above-mentioned areas will be in danger. In fact, not only Westerners in China, but all Western interests from Singapore to Vladivostok, are in the same boat. No matter how they compete, they have the same interest in firmly maintaining their inherent position to resist Japan's

Continued Expansion

If they firmly unite to deal with the enemy, they will not only achieve great success in direct resistance, but also exert a strong influence on public opinion and governments in their home countries, so that the Far East policies of the Western powers will immediately become more active than in the recent past. The most powerful white people in the entire Far East firmly believe in this, but mere deep belief is not enough. What the situation requires is thought and action. Important Westerners should take all matters into their own hands and take action, and it is expected that they will receive a huge common response.

### Commemorative Stamps to Celebrate American Independence Day will be Sold Tomorrow; Commissioned to be Printed by the American Bank Note Company, Adorned with Chinese and American Flags, Making them Very Precious

The Kunming Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications has planned a set of commemorative stamps to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the founding of the United States on July 4th, and commissioned the American Bank Note Company to print them. They have now been transported from the United States to Hong Kong, and then distributed from Hong Kong to post offices in various places. They are scheduled to be sold on July 4th. There are four denominations: 5 cents, 25 cents, 50 cents, and 1 yuan. A large batch has now arrived in Shanghai, and it is expected that philatelists will rush to buy them. It is reported that the commemorative stamps will be sold from July 4, 1939 to March 31, 1940. After the expiration date, the sale will be stopped. Within one month after the suspension of sale, from April 1 to April 30, 1940, they can still be used to pay for postage. From May 1, 1940, they will be abolished and cannot be used again. If there are still people who have these stamps, they can exchange them for ordinary stamps of the same value at post offices. It is reported that the commemorative stamps are adorned with Chinese and American flags, and the paper is exquisite and the colors are novel, which is unmatched by ordinary stamps.

### Original Intention of the Civil Service Commission Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's Increase in Subsidies

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office sent a letter stating: "Regarding the news released by this bureau on the 28th of last month regarding the approval of increased subsidies for employees, there is a paragraph that states "...but the Civil Service Commission believes that the bureau should consider the treatment of employees at any time according to the social situation to ensure fairness. The recent increase in the cost of living should be considered by the bureau to determine how to subsidize employees..." The wording is slightly different from the original meaning. To avoid misunderstandings, the revision should be as follows: "But the Civil Service Commission believes that the public must always be prepared to give those who serve the public fair wages according to the situation. The public should consider the impact of the recent increase in the cost of living and should decide how to assist such people." We hereby request your newspaper to disclose this letter. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office."

### Charity Tea Dance Party - Promoting Association Affairs - Singing Competition Applications Overwhelming - Famous Stars to Participate in Dancing

The Charity Tea Dance Party, organized by the dance hall group fundraising committee of the Municipal Refugee Relief Association, officially opened on the first of the month at the String Music Dance Palace. Guests from all walks of life have been very crowded. Now, in order to strengthen the lineup and consolidate strength, the conference has decided to hire social celebrities to form an advisory committee to assist in promoting association affairs, and to hire the film industry to form an entertainment committee to preside over various performance programs of the conference. In addition, dance hall managers will be hired to form a field affairs committee to be responsible for adjusting the dance star lineup.

Singing Competition: In addition, in order to increase the interest of guests, the conference has sought well-known ladies and singers from the sea to hold a singing competition. In recent days, many people have signed up, including Miss Zhu Yun, Miss Juan Juan, Miss Qin Yan, and Miss Fang Fang. The association will invite famous experts to form a judging committee to start the competition regularly. It is hoped that enthusiastic ladies will actively participate.

Red Stars Dancing: The conference has now obtained the participation of red stars from major dance halls on the sea to participate in dancing, such as Chen Manli from Paramount, who is allowed to dance on Saturdays and Sundays, and will participate for one day on the 4th (Tuesday). Zhou Meijun from Xianle is allowed to dance every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Xu Hong is allowed to dance on Sundays. Other first-class red stars have also been successively scheduled and will be announced in newspapers every day.

### Raising Funds for Refugee Hygiene - Citywide Joint Effort

Since the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Fundraising Hygiene Fund Committee started fundraising on the 26th of last month, with the enthusiastic support of all sectors of society, the results have been quite considerable. Mr. Gu Keming, the director of the committee and manager of Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, is usually happy to do good deeds. All social charities are generous in their donations. This time, he spared no effort to run around in order to raise more than 50,000 yuan. A few days ago, he invited Mr. Fang Jiaobo, a idle person at sea, to broadcast a speech on the Oriental Radio Station. The following is an excerpt of Mr. Fang's speech: Ladies and gentlemen, everyone, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in view of the large population of this city, and in this summer with sudden heat and high fire, epidemics are extremely easy to occur. Especially in Shanghai after the war, the occurrence of epidemics is of course unavoidable. Therefore, in order to be prepared, we have to find a way to raise a sum of hygiene funds. Thanks to the kindness of medical groups and social groups, a fundraising hygiene fund committee has been organized. This kind of heroic act is indeed worthy of our admiration. At the same time, the strength of these ten groups is very strong, so the result of the fundraising in the future must be considerable. A bit of achievement is to reduce our danger by a bit. Especially for the general refugees, they will get a lot of help. Because the nutrition of the refugees is of course inferior to ours, and in the summer when epidemics are spreading, refugees are of course easily infected. If the refugees have epidemics and are not treated quickly, then we will feel extremely dangerous. To avoid this danger is to find ways to eliminate it as early as possible. Therefore, our fundraising for hygiene funds this time is to prevent the occurrence of epidemics. The authorities of the concession are of course absolutely concerned, but such a crowded population is really impossible to prevent. In order to protect our safety, we must assist the authorities to work hard. I hope that all gentlemen will actively donate and work together to succeed. Saving people is saving yourself. At the same time, broadcasting blessings will be immeasurable. I have been the director of fundraising for the Refugee Association since October last year. Almost every day, I hope that kind people from all walks of life will pay close attention to the refugees. This time, I hope that all sectors of society will make even greater efforts to raise hygiene funds.

### Jewish Refugees Arrive Again - More Than 800 People - The Remaining 400+ Are Scheduled to Arrive Today

860 German-European Jewish refugees were transported from Central Europe by the Italian postal ship Baike Mennor and arrived in Shanghai at noon the other day. Another 470 people were transported to Shanghai by the Oushalemo ship the day before yesterday. Together with the 30 people who arrived in Shanghai on the 26th, there are nearly 1,400 people.

### Crime in the Public Concession Increases Sharply - Number of Prisoners Reaches Over 7,000 - Total of Over 2,400 Crime Cases in May, an Increase of 914 Compared to the Same Period Last Year

According to the Public Concession Police Department, due to the sharp increase in population after the war, the large number of unemployed people, and the soaring prices and rising living standards, the number of crime cases has also increased proportionally. In the Public Concession, the number of cases that occurred in May of this year included 6 homicides, 5 attempted homicides, 4 murders, 13 abductions, 93 armed robberies, 13 other robberies, 52 burglaries, 46 pickpocketing thefts, 1,305 thefts, 34 harboring thieves, 116 snatching thefts, 84 opium cases, 46 gambling cases, and 587 other cases, totaling 2,404 cases, an increase of 914 cases compared to the same period last year, and an increase of 283 cases compared to April of this year. Therefore, the total number of prisoners in custody has reached 7,432, which is a serious overcrowding problem. Therefore, in addition to the amnesty measures of the Chinese government, those who have committed minor crimes will be temporarily pardoned, and parole will be adopted. Those who have committed crimes for the first time, whose cases are minor, who have behaved well in prison, and who have served more than two-thirds of their sentences will be selected for parole. However, if they are arrested again after being released from prison without reforming, the parole part will still be enforced according to the regulations.

### Handling of Mail After the Blockade of Ningbo and Wenzhou - Parcels to Eastern Zhejiang Suspended, Letters to be Forwarded

Since the Japanese army forcibly landed in Dinghai (Zhoushan), the situation in eastern Zhejiang has suddenly become tense. The Ningbo and Wenzhou Garrison Headquarters successively announced the blockade of the ports of Ningbo and Wenzhou in order to strengthen defense. Yesterday, it was learned from the Transportation Division of the Shanghai Postal Administration that, regarding parcels to various cities and counties in eastern Zhejiang and along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the bureau, in view of the interruption of transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang and the difficulty of transportation, has suspended the acceptance and posting of large and small parcels to eastern Zhejiang since the day before yesterday. Once transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang is restored, they can be accepted and posted as usual. In addition, regarding ordinary registered express letters and other lightweight mail, the Transportation Division of the bureau is making every effort to find ways to forward them. Before receiving the notice from the Zhejiang Postal Administration (Lishui), remittance will remain as it is. As for Shantou mail, although it is still being accepted and posted as usual, according to the person in charge of the bureau, the notification telegram issued by the Shantou Postal Bureau is still on the way and is expected to be received within days. At that time, it can be decided whether to stop accepting it or not. However, parcels sent from Shanghai to Shantou have already been stopped.

### Cholera Discovered in Shanghai - Concession Actively Preventing and Controlling

After the cholera epidemic in Shanghai last year, coupled with the depressing climate and the density of the population in the concession, cholera has occurred earlier than expected. However, it has not reached the level of an epidemic. In addition to paying attention and preventing it, the health authorities also hope that residents will be cautious about hygiene. In terms of prevention and control, the various branches of the health department have already started preventive injections. All epidemic hospitals have opened epidemic departments, such as the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yuqiaqing Road and the Zhenxin Hospital on Tianjin Road, all of which provide free medical treatment and have beds and ambulances.

### Fake "Anti-Smoking Bureau" - Plans to Establish "Smoking Cessation Centers" - Poisoning and Disturbing the People - The People in the Chongqing Area Will Have No Peace

After the "Anti-Smoking Bureau" organized by the Japanese puppets announced its "establishment", Yu Junqing presided over it and set up an office on the second floor of No. 2 Jiuyi on North Sichuan Road, Hongkou. It had increased the tobacco tax on various opium dens in western Shanghai, which was rejected by various opium dens. The puppet bureau arrested many opium den owners, causing a total work stoppage dispute in the opium dens. According to a reporter from Daguang News Agency, the puppet bureau is now planning to set up opium dens in Hongkou Xiangyanqiao, Qiujiang Road, and other places and has recruited people to undertake them. At the same time, in order to cover up the public sale of opium, it is falsely claiming to establish so-called "smoking cessation centers" and "anti-smuggling teams". After this puppet organization is realized, it will poison and disturb the people at the same time. The people in the occupied area of Chongqing will have no peace.

### Increased Overdue Fees for Large Domestic Parcels

### Young Woman Heavily Pregnant - Firmly Requests Divorce - Husband Sues for Cohabitation on the Pretext of Returning Home - Wife Files Counterclaim, Awaiting Payment of Litigation Fees for Further Review

Shao Chuzeng, a young man from Yuyao, married Sun Qiaoying, a woman from the same town. They soon turned against each other, and recently they have been suing each other in court. The marriage of the two was not originally the intention of the head of the family, but a match made. The fathers of the two had been partners in the paper business in this city, and the two families had been on good terms. Therefore, they took advantage of the good relationship between the families to further the marriage. On December 4 last year, they held a wedding at a restaurant on Fuzhou Road. Originally, the two had grown up

Side by Side

The love turned into hatred because the bride was not used to being discriminated against by her parents-in-law and sister-in-law, so she focused her frustration on the groom. Therefore, after the honeymoon, Qiaoying returned home on the pretext and took away her clothes and accessories. The Shao family pointed out that she had run away, and since then the two parties had turned from relatives into enemies. Although the two lived together for a short time, the wife was pregnant. Recently, her abdomen gradually bulged like a grave. The parents of both parties deeply felt that such a conflict was not a good solution. They also tried to find a solution many times, but Qiaoying firmly wanted a divorce, and Chuzeng demanded cohabitation.

Two Opposing Views

It was not possible for the mediators to be effective. Therefore, Shao Chuzeng filed a lawsuit against Sun Qiaoying in the First Special District Court for cohabitation. Sun Qiaoying also filed a counterclaim against Shao for divorce. Yesterday, Judge Gui Yu held a hearing and questioned them. First, Shao Chuzeng stated that he was 23 years old and submitted a marriage certificate, requesting that the defendant return home and fulfill her obligations of cohabitation as husband and wife. Then, Sun Qiaoying stated that she was 21 years old and immediately listed all the facts of the bad treatment by her parents-in-law and sister-in-law, especially

During the Honeymoon

Her parents-in-law refused to give her pillows and bedding, and even if she wanted copper coins to soak her feet later, she had to ask for them. What made her most unbearable was that she said she really couldn't stand all this pain and had to get a divorce. However, the court hoped that the two would not divorce, so it asked Shao whether she could live separately from her parents-in-law. Shao said that she only gets a monthly salary of 11 yuan now and that the couple's life still depends on their parents' support. There is no ability to form a separate family. At that time, Shao's agent lawyer Zhu suddenly raised the issue of Sun Qiaoying's pregnancy, claiming that Sun was so heavily pregnant and that she firmly stated that she was unwilling to live with her husband again. It was a sign of the defendant's inner self-disposal, so

The Pregnancy

Will still need to be examined in the future. Judge Gui considered that the lawyer's sudden statement was too much, as it aroused suspicion. He then asked Shao Chuzeng what attitude he had towards Sun's pregnancy. Shao said that he could not talk about this point now. Afterwards, Sun stated that she had been pregnant for seven months and that her lawyer defended the legal provisions of the pregnancy period. After the court clarified the marriage period and pregnancy period, Shao said that he no longer doubted it. As a result of the trial, the defendant was ordered to pay the counterclaim litigation fee, and the hearing was adjourned.

### Everything is Expensive, Life is Not Easy - Practice Thrift, Use National Products - The Buyiyi Association Encourages People from All Walks of Life to Practice it and Send Doctors and Medicines to Benefit the Poor and Sick

Recently, foreign exchange has been tight, raw materials have soared, and various industries have raised prices in order to avoid losing all their capital. There are unscrupulous merchants who take the opportunity to make profits and deliberately raise prices, so that ordinary residents feel the hardship of life. The only way to remedy this is to practice thrift and use national products in order to overcome all difficulties. Since the establishment of the Buyiyi Association in this city this spring, it has been dedicated to promoting national products and promoting thrift.

The association is now stepping up its efforts to encourage the Chinese people to practice thrift, use national products, and welcome people from all walks of life to join the association in order to practice it and overcome the difficulties of the war. It is also learned that the association is actively preparing for the summer health campaign, organizing medical consultations and medicine distribution, hiring more than 20 famous Chinese and Western doctors to preside over it, and specially contracting several national drug stores and Western drug stores to distribute medicines in order to serve the general public. The details will be announced in the coming days.

### Husband Loses Job - Stabs Wife to Death - Police Strictly Pursue the Murderer for Extortion Dispute

On the south end of Laifeide Road, Caishi Road, French Concession, outside the back door of No. 37, Shuxiang Lane, a husband stabbed his wife, Miss Dan, to death. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, the deceased, Miss Lu Da, was 25 years old, from Nantong, and lived with her husband, Zhou Sima Pi, on the first floor of No. 136, Laoshenfu Road.

On the first day, at 7 p.m., Lu went to the Shuxiang Lane 37, Caishi Road, to talk to Xu Lu, an old woman from the same town, on the platform room on the third floor. Zhou also followed her and asked her for 6 yuan, but she refused. The couple quarreled. Xu tried to send them away. The couple went home together. As soon as they left the back door, Zhou took out a sharp knife and stabbed her arm. Because it was a vital part, she fell to the ground and died. Zhou saw that he had caused a major disaster and fled. Residents of Shuxiang Lane reported it to the police station, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. On one hand, they moved the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy and took the witness, Xu Lu, an old woman, for interrogation. They will report to the court today to send someone to inspect the body. It is heard that the deceased has no relatives in Shanghai other than her husband, who is on the run. The police station has sent detectives to search for the fugitive murderer and bring him to justice.

### Thugs Steal Money - Six Criminals Sentenced to Collection Separately

Li Laoer, a native of Huzhou, lives at a certain number on Wuding Road and sells used goods. At 11:15 p.m. on June 29, he went out from his home and walked to the entrance of Lane 1 on Hede Road. He happened to meet a woman surnamed Wang who was chatting. Unexpectedly, a group of hooligans, including Li De and Wang Shaoshan from Anhui, Huang Jianyuan, Liu Yunhong, Le Bangyue, and Wen Daoquan, saw it and thought that Li had improper behavior with the woman. They rushed forward and forced him into a small teahouse nearby, stealing 6 yuan of legal currency on the pretext and fleeing separately. Li Laoer knew that Li De lived at No. 90, Xinzha Road, so he reported the information to the Gedeng Road Police Station, which sent Chinese detective Pi Shaozhang and detective Li Zhaoyuan to secretly arrest Li first, and then to continue to arrest Wang Shaoshan and five others at No. 13 on the same road, and took them to the police station together. The other day, they were sent to the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the police station, sentenced Wen Daoquan to three months of imprisonment for robbery.

### Qingyuli Dispute Resolved - Extension of Relocation

The relocation dispute in Yuqing Lane, Xin Chongqing Road, this city, occurred in April of this year and has lasted for three months. The Women's Bank, based on contractual relationship, and the matter has been submitted to the court for a relocation judgment, which is bound to be implemented. However, more than 3,000 tenants in the entire lane are in this extraordinary period, with an oversupply of population and housing in Shanghai, making it difficult to find another place to live. The law is not beyond human affection. The public groups have repeatedly asked to uphold justice and sued the court for exemption from execution. The Ministry of Justice and Administration has also approved the matter for careful handling. Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng and other mediators have also mediated many times. It is learned that the Women's Bank and the tenants have room to find a place to live during this period, and the Women's Bank will demolish and build new buildings according to the original plan.

### Heavy Rain in This City Yesterday - Roads Flooded into Ditches - Pedestrians Must Use Vehicles for Ferry

Since the night before yesterday, it has been raining all night. Yesterday, from dawn to noon, heavy rain poured down and did not stop for a while, causing the roads to be flooded into ditches, especially in front of the Xianshi and Yong'an companies on Nanjing Road, which became a small river with a depth of more than half a foot. The depth of the water on Zhejiang Road on the north side of Nanjing Road and Yinghua Street on the south side was also three or four inches. Vehicles passed by, splashing waves everywhere, which was caused by the insufficient drainage of the sewers. At that time, pedestrians had to wade through the water with their ankles, or they had to be ferried by rickshaws. In addition, the roads in the French Concession, such as Sapposai Road, Ximen Road, and Maisaerti Road, and the west side of the Extreme Sifeier Road, Difeng Road, and Yanping Road, were also flooded to the point where the water was almost up to the shins. General rickshaw drivers temporarily ferried pedestrians, making a profit ten times over.

### Young Woman Lured and Raped - Then Sold as a Prostitute - Then Extorted Money from Her Husband - Reported to the Police and Arrested Various Criminals Detained Separately Awaiting Sentencing

Sun Bing, the 21-year-old wife of Liu Yaocai from Danyang, who resides at No. 27, Anyi Village, North Xizang Road, was lured out by her fellow villager Chen Jigen between June 14 and was raped overnight in a small inn on Minguo Road, French Concession. The next morning, he went to the Guan room of the Zhongnan Hotel on Xizang Road, Public Concession, and invited his fellow villager Liu Muhai to come, intending to sell her to someone, but there were no customers.

Slept and Took Turns Raping

Later, he found Changzhou Zhong and sold her to a brothel opened by Zhao Guannian, a woman from Yangzhou, at No. 40, Xiamen Road, to be a prostitute, forcing her to receive customers.

Yu Haisheng, a 25-year-old native of Pudong and owner of the "Good Fortune and Abundance" confectionery store at No. 1433, Yu Road, previously borrowed several thousand yuan from his aunt. Unable to repay the debt, on August 21st of last year, he devised a plan to lure Bao Jiang to Room 627 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, where he strangled her to death and fled. On October 4th of the same year, he was arrested at the Wuxi Hostel on Hankou Road by the police and brought before the First Special Court. After interrogation, Yu Haisheng was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death, with permanent deprivation of his civil rights. Yu contested the verdict and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, which commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. Yu remained dissatisfied and hired lawyer Yu Enliang to file an appeal with the Supreme Court. After reviewing the case, the Supreme Court ordered a new trial by the Second Branch of the High Court. Presiding Judge Yu held multiple hearings and, upon concluding the investigation, deemed the evidence conclusive. Yesterday, the First Criminal Division of the court convened to pronounce the verdict in the presence of the accused Yu: "Ruling: Appeal dismissed."

Qi Linsheng, a 55-year-old doctor of traditional Chinese medicine from Shangcheng, Henan, residing at No. 10, Yongyuli, intersection of Lafayete Road and Beile Road, was recently accused in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court by Chen Wang, a woman from Suzhou residing at No. 1, Wufengli, intersection of Xavia Road and Luban Road, through her lawyer Hu Yongsheng, of enticing her daughter Chen Sannan and hiding her in the pavilion room of Wang Yongquan's home at No. 522 Beile Road for illicit sexual relations.

The Jing'an Temple Police Station of the Public Concession, in view of the frequent presence of unlawful individuals in the border area of West Shanghai, has specially deployed Chinese and foreign detectives to patrol the area at all times for the sake of public order. Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 3:40 PM, West Inspector No. 83 of the police station, along with Chinese police officers No. 2364, No. 2564, and No. 2989, were patrolling near the illegal extensions of Zhuanbang on Yidingpan Road in West Shanghai. They noticed seven or eight suspicious men dressed in various styles of plain clothes loitering within the concession, behaving strangely. They approached the men to question them and intended to search them. However, upon seeing the detectives approach, the men pulled out firearms and opened fire to resist the search. Seeing the seriousness of the situation, the Chinese and foreign detectives returned fire while immediately telegraphing the Jing'an Temple Police Station to dispatch a large number of detectives on police vehicles to suppress the situation. Within moments, the detectives gathered, and the plainclothes men, seeing the situation, fled towards Zhuanbang. In the end, more than ten shots were fired, and neither side suffered any injuries.

Education News

### Local Education in Zhejiang: Past Conditions and Improvements (1) Cultivating and Training Teachers, Improving Teacher Salaries

(Fangyan Correspondence) Local education is the foundation of all education and the starting point for all educational endeavors. The cultural level of a province or county is always judged by the quality of local education. The smooth implementation of political policies is also closely related to the progress of local education. Although Zhejiang Province has been continuously striving to promote improvements in recent years, it still falls short of meeting the current urgent needs. The key problems are the lack of teachers in quantity and poor quality, as well as the shortage of funding and the imperfection of administrative mechanisms, which are the biggest reasons. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, aware of this, presented the past conditions of local education and the key points for future improvement to the first meeting of the Provincial Assembly for discussion. The original text is excerpted below:

A. Past Conditions

1. Regarding the teaching staff in primary schools in various counties, the total number of primary school teachers in the 26th year of the Republic was 29,621. Among them, 40% were primary school graduates. Less than 20% had received normal school education. The rest were students who graduated or dropped out from middle schools or vocational schools. With such a quality of teachers, it is difficult to improve the level of basic education and promote the spirit of the nation. To remedy this deficiency, we must actively cultivate teachers on one hand, and train existing teachers on the other. Training existing teachers includes holding short-term intensive training courses for primary school teachers, establishing teacher training institutions, and conducting qualification examinations to improve their knowledge and skills, so that they can directly benefit students' learning. As for cultivating teachers, based on the existing 14 schools with 83 classes, only over 300 students graduate each year, which is far from enough to replace the unqualified teachers. Furthermore, if we want to implement universal education and establish more short-term primary schools and wartime civilian schools, the need for teachers will be even greater. According to the statistics of the recent two years, there are still over 1.2 million children who are out of school and over 3.3 million adults who are out of school. Assuming that each primary school teacher teaches an average of 30 children, we need to train 40,000 teachers. Assuming that each civilian school teacher teaches an average of 32 adults, we need to train over 103,000 teachers. The total is over 143,000 teachers. Cultivating such a large number of teachers is definitely beyond the current financial capacity of Zhejiang Province. However, the qualitative improvement and quantitative expansion of teachers still need to be gradually addressed to develop local education.

2. Although we are doing our best to cultivate and train teachers, if their salaries cannot be improved, then the cultivation and training will be in vain. Since the outbreak of the war, primary school teachers with higher qualifications and academic abilities have mostly been absorbed by other institutions with better salaries. It is found that nearly half of the trainees in various training teams and classes are former primary school teachers, creating an unprecedented crisis in the primary school education sector in this province. It is found that the salaries of primary school teachers in this province are as low as two or three yuan per month. Even the salaries of teachers in county-run primary schools, which are the highest, average only over 17 yuan per month, which is not enough to maintain personal life, let alone support a family. The fact that local education in various counties can still be maintained is due to the reliance on young men who have received some education but are not qualified. In the future, the level of local education will gradually decline, which goes without saying. Therefore, improving the salaries of primary school teachers is an urgent matter for developing local education.

3. The failure to improve the salaries of primary school teachers and the failure to improve school facilities in the past are due to the lack of funding for local education. It is found that the main source of education funding in various counties is the 40% surtax on land tax and the 10% surtax, as well as slaughter tax, deed tax, property tax, school property rent, school fees, etc. A county education fund management committee is established to manage them to ensure the independence of education funding. However, since the change from the special fund system to the unified revenue and expenditure system, the independence of education funding has lost its guarantee, and the county education funding has declined year by year. In the 25th year of the Republic, county education funding accounted for less than 23% of the total local funding, in the 26th year of the Republic it accounted for slightly over 17%, and in the 27th year of the Republic it dropped to less than 11%. What is even worse is that, compared with the budget and final account of the county education funding in the 26th year of the Republic, an average of 29% of the funds that should have been spent were not spent. The only thing that maintains the poorly paid teachers and the poorly equipped schools is the education funding, but there are also cases of arrears and misappropriation, which is really hateful. Therefore, the county education funding should have a prescribed standard, guarantee its independence, and plan to increase it to develop local education.

### Academia Sinica Solicits Prize-Winning Papers: In Memory of Yang Quan and Ding Wenjiang, Deadline End of January Next Year

(Chongqing Airmail News) The Academia Sinica is offering a Yang Quan Prize and a Ding Wenjiang Prize in memory of the late Secretary-General Yang Quan and Ding Wenjiang. Each prize is worth 2,000 yuan. Last year, the Ding Wenjiang Prize was awarded by the council of the academy to Mr. Wu Dayou for his greatest contributions to physics.

The Hongkou Youqiang Qingqing Triangle Cross-Country Race was held at 6:15 yesterday morning. The competition along the way was fierce. As a result, Youqiang won the team championship with a total team score of 40 points. Hongkou, with key players Gu Huiyuan, Wan Jinsheng, and Chen Zixiang all absent, suffered a great loss of strength and finished second. Qingqing finished fourth. Gao Dingtai won the individual championship, and Zhou Ruquan finished second. Youqiang's Gao Dingtai took the lead from the start, with veterans Zhou Ruquan and Xu Xingzhe trailing by about 30 yards.

### Comments on the System of Using "Interbank Transfer Certificates"

— Zhang Yifan

After the Reintroduction of Restrictions on Cash Withdrawals

Starting June 22nd, the Ministry of Finance once again restricted withdrawals. Only 500 yuan in cash can be withdrawn per week; amounts exceeding this can be paid with transfer vouchers. Transfer vouchers cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange and cannot be used outside of Shanghai; although there is an illegal discounting market, the discount rate is quite high. Therefore, after the implementation of this order, two major phenomena occurred in the Shanghai financial market:

(1) There is a large shortage of legal tender in circulation, and all new cash transactions are severely restricted, so the frenzied speculative market suddenly cools down; speculative prices that were soaring have uniformly plummeted.

(2) Due to the lack of legal tender and the renewed emphasis on the transfer system, transfer discounting speculation, which had been suppressed, has resurfaced, and is even more intense than before.

The purpose of restricting withdrawals and deposits was originally to prevent capital flight and stabilize wartime finance. Judging from the first phenomenon, its mission has been clearly accomplished.

However, since transfers can be discounted, the gateway for capital flight has clearly not been completely closed. The surge in the discount rate can reduce the gateway for capital leakage, but the effect is minimal; however, its impact on prices and the livelihood of ordinary people is significant. Transfer vouchers cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange, which is certainly the greatest advantage; but at the same time, they cannot be used to purchase local goods in the interior, which cannot but be said to be a major flaw in the midst of perfection. Therefore, opinions on the current transfer system vary; consequently, there are also conflicting views on illegal transfer discounts. There is good reason for this!

Supplementary Measures and Supplementary Currency

In order to take care of domestic trade, in addition to restricting cash deposits of 500 yuan, it is necessary to open up another financing opportunity; and this financing opportunity must not be utilized by those fleeing capital. The current transfer discounting is certainly a financing method, but it subjects both legitimate commercial needs and capital flight to the same high discount rates, and still cannot prevent capital flight, but instead allows the transfer of transfer discounts to the local product market, causing price increases and even affecting its transactions and exports. Therefore, the ideal financing method should at least have the following characteristics: directly, it cannot purchase foreign exchange, and indirectly, it cannot purchase foreign exchange; domestically, although it does not go through the process of being exchanged into legal tender, it can still be used to purchase local products everywhere, and is not limited to Shanghai. Therefore, in addition to legal tender and transfer vouchers, a new currency that meets these principles should be established. However, this new currency must not disrupt the supply and demand relationship of the entire currency market, nor damage the integrity of the legal tender system as a basic condition. Therefore, after its issuance, it should have the function of contracting legal tender; otherwise, there is a crisis of inflation. However, it should only be limited to contracting the amount of legal tender in circulation, and absolutely not usurp the position and prestige of legal tender in the circulation sector; otherwise, it would be aiding a tyrant and would suffer a disastrous end.

Based on the above principles, the Shanghai Bankers' and Money Dealers' Association has now decided to advocate the establishment of a system for using "Interbank Transfer Certificates" in order to remedy the disadvantages to domestic trade after the current restriction on cash deposits, and to eliminate the various drawbacks that current transfer discounting gives to prices and creditors. It is said that this "Transfer Certificate" is issued through the joint cooperation of Chinese and foreign bankers and money dealers, and is scheduled to be implemented starting tomorrow. Let us first look at its content.

(1) Each bank and firm shall submit (1) major goods, (2) company bonds and stocks with official market prices in the Shanghai market, and (3) real estate with rights and interests within the Shanghai Concession to the Joint Reserve as collateral; and receive 70% of the evaluated value of the collateral in "Interbank Transfer Certificates."

(2) All transfers between banks and firms shall be paid with "Interbank Transfer Certificates." Transfer accounts of banks and firms shall use special checkbooks issued by the Joint Reserve.

(3) "Interbank Transfer Certificates" may be transferred to the interior for the purpose of purchasing local goods. Although the regulations do not state "cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange" and "cannot be discounted into legal tender," in fact, of course, they cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange and cannot be discounted into legal tender.

(4) "Interbank Transfer Certificates" have a maximum issuance amount of 70% of the evaluated value of the collateral; when the value of the collateral falls, it must be replenished. One representative each from the Chamber of Commerce, the Foreign Bankers' Association, and the Bankers' and Money Dealers' Association; and one representative jointly dispatched by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, shall jointly form an "Issuance Reserve Inspection Committee" to inspect at least once a month.

(5) The interest rate for using transfer certificates and the interest rate for transfer deposits shall be publicly set by the Joint Reserve daily; each bank and firm shall settle interest on transfer deposits and debts once a month; when necessary, the Joint Reserve may inspect the deposit situation of each bank and firm.

This content is obtained from the analysis of the two types of regulations reported: the usage method and the inspection method. Are there any other issuance regulations? It is not known. In our opinion, in order to avoid disrupting the currency system, it is not necessary to have issuance regulations, but the performance of the "Transfer Certificate" should be clearly stipulated in writing.

The Characteristics of "Interbank Transfer Certificates"

As shown in the above content, the "Interbank Transfer Certificate" seems to have the same characteristics as the German "Blocked Mark," both of which can be used domestically but cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange. The difference is that the "Blocked Mark" can be used as the final payment domestically, while the "Transfer Certificate" only serves as a means of offsetting debts and credits between the two parties and as a certificate for "transferring accounts." At the same time, the "Transfer Certificate" has a definite reserve and is jointly issued by the private financial sector, so it does not have the characteristics of legal tender and is healthier than the unreserved "Blocked Mark."

The reserve is definite and jointly issued by the banking and money-dealing industries, so it is the same as the "bank official receipt" with the nature of "wealth certificate", and is by no means the so-called "circulating note" of non-redeemable paper money. The difference is that bank official receipts can be exchanged for legal tender; even if they are not exchanged, they can be used for final payment in clearing. This can only be used for the acceptance and transfer of transfers between the same industry and as a certificate of "transferring accounts", and cannot be cashed. Therefore, it has the same nature as transfer vouchers.

Transfer vouchers cannot be used outside of Shanghai, otherwise they will require a premium; this can be transferred to the interior to purchase local goods without requiring a premium; the credit of transfer vouchers is guaranteed by individuals, while this is jointly guaranteed by the banking and money-dealing industries. Once transfer vouchers are discounted, they can be used to purchase foreign exchange; this cannot be discounted, so it cannot indirectly escape its funds. Therefore, it is far superior to transfer vouchers!

In terms of its ability to purchase local goods anywhere in the country, it is completely different from legal tender. However, legal tender can be used to purchase foreign exchange, while this cannot.

If the characteristics of "transfer certificates" are indeed like this, then it is truly an ideal type of blocked currency. After the implementation of this certificate, the following four good effects can be obtained:

(1) On the other hand, with the universality of this certificate, the need for legal tender in the domestic circulation sector can be eliminated invisibly. With the reduction of legal tender in the circulation sector, speculative trends such as fleeing funds and foreign exchange cash can be suppressed.

(2) After this certificate is transferred and exchanged, it can be used to purchase local goods in the interior, which can allow Shanghai's funds to flow into the interior on a large scale; and on a small scale, it can invisibly maintain the balance of Shanghai's trade with the interior.

(3) While the circulation of transfer certificates increases, the amount of current transfer vouchers used will decrease in inverse proportion. Transfer discounting speculation can be eliminated.

(4) The transfer certificate is at par with legal tender, and the amount of issuance is limited by the amount of reserves and the guarantee ratio for use, so there is no risk of inflation; prices will not be affected.

The purpose of wartime financial policy is nothing more than to prevent capital flight and adjust the use of funds. Therefore, we should unanimously support, jointly promote, and earnestly implement this transfer certificate system advocated by the local financial authorities. And before implementation, we should each contribute constructive suggestions to make it a perfect system.

Shortcomings That Must Be Improved

If interbank transfer certificates are indeed as described above, they can be called an ideal system. However, there are still areas that should be studied in terms of the technology of issuance, use, and promotion:

(1) The performance of the transfer certificate still lacks complete and clear written regulations. Words such as "cannot be used to purchase foreign exchange" and "cannot be discounted" should be clearly listed to avoid doubts and open the door to abuses.

(2) Legal tender and public bonds should be added to the collateral. Because there is absolutely no reason to exclude the two types of wealth, legal tender and public bonds, from the scope of collateral. The fact that they are not listed now is truly unfathomable! If legal tender is listed as one of the collateral, and its statutory ratio to be paid is stipulated, then the effect of contracting the circulation of legal tender will be further emphasized. If it is feared that the legal tender holdings of each bank and firm will be too short, hindering their legitimate maneuvering; then it is not necessary to stipulate the ratio to be paid. If, after freely using legal tender as collateral, no one will use legal tender as collateral again. In fact, even if no one provides it, there is still a need to list it. Otherwise, it will be enough to breed doubts. If the "international currency" and "trade currency" advocated by the Japanese, etc., we must avoid being mixed up with it. Since the collateral is evaluated at any time, there is no inconvenience in listing public bonds and listing corporate bonds and stocks. If public bonds are excluded and legal tender is excluded, then the future status of transfer certificates in the Chinese circulation sector, and its status as a merit or crime in the Chinese currency market, will be determined by this shortcoming today, it can be asserted.

(3) The issuance of transfer certificates can obtain the cooperation of foreign banks, which is due to their support for the Chinese legal tender system, their sympathy for maintaining Shanghai's finances, and the necessity of maintaining their own commercial interests in China. In addition, it must be the point that this certificate can be used to purchase local products in the interior. This performance will also be a strong guarantee that transfer certificates will not be discounted. But the so-called interior should be divided into two types: the occupied areas and the non-occupied areas. If this system is a supplementary currency to legal tender, and it does have the various characteristics mentioned above; then it can naturally be used unconditionally in non-occupied areas. But there are problems in the occupied areas. If these problems cannot be solved, and the purchase of goods in the occupied areas is stopped fundamentally; it can also have the effect of crushing the Japanese scheme to monopolize the products of the occupied areas. If these problems cannot be solved, and the purchase of goods in the occupied areas continues, then the issuance of this certificate is tantamount to sealing up the cash in Shanghai, exclusively for the purpose of purchasing goods in the occupied areas; as for the non-occupied areas, this certificate is used purely for acceptance and transfer, and no cash is used. Then the result of the implementation of this certificate must be contrary to its purpose of issuance! It must be carried out with particular caution and prudence!

### Commentary on the New Exchange Allocation System and Other Matters

— Xie Juzeng

Since the Ministry of Finance sent a telegram to Shanghai restricting each depositor in banks and money shops to withdrawing only 500 法幣 (legal tender) per week, with any excess amounts to be settled through exchange allocation and only allowing bank and money shop transfers to prevent capital flight, the Shanghai financial market has immediately taken on a new look following the seven supplementary measures discussed and agreed upon by the Banking and Money Shop Associations and approved by the Ministry of Finance. When this new method of stabilizing finance was first announced, all sectors were inevitably somewhat alarmed, but after the earnest explanations of industry leaders, calm soon prevailed. However, there were still many misunderstandings in some quarters, so I will not hesitate to address these in detail to clarify the situation.

First, although this method of restricting withdrawals and deposits is similar to the method of stabilizing finance during the August 13th Incident, the motivations are completely different. The method during the August 13th Incident was initiated by the financial sector and approved by the financial authorities, with the aim of preventing the expansion of deposit withdrawal panics and affecting the reserves of banks and money shops. This new restriction, however, is in compliance with a telegram from the Ministry of Finance, completely initiated by the financial authorities, with the financial sector having no prior knowledge. Therefore, several financial giants convened a meeting at 2:00 AM after receiving the telegram, demonstrating the urgency of the matter. Needless to say, the purpose of this move is to consolidate the foreign exchange stabilization fund and prevent speculation in 法幣, so it was implemented with the same swiftness as the cessation of foreign exchange supply at a rate of 8.25 per dollar on June 7th. However, some people outside mistakenly believe that this is a stopgap measure by the financial sector to deal with deposit withdrawals, especially Western newspapers, which believe that the Ministry of Finance's telegram greatly helps the deposit withdrawal panic of Chinese banks, otherwise they would not be able to cope. In fact, the opposite is true, because most banks and money shops in Shanghai currently feel that they have excess capital. After the exchange rate market changed on June 7th, although many depositors withdrew 法幣 to purchase foreign exchange or engage in other speculations, the banks and money shops themselves did not feel threatened by withdrawals. However, from the perspective of the overall national policy, this distressing phenomenon should not be allowed to continue. Therefore, they immediately complied with the Ministry of Finance's telegram. Although they knew that it would inevitably cause misunderstandings among a few short-sighted depositors and feared that foreign banks would take the opportunity to absorb deposits, creating a situation of "driving fish into deep waters", they chose the lesser of two evils and could not consider everything.

Second, some people advocate that Shanghai should be transformed into a transfer-only port in the future. This principle is worth supporting, although whether it can be smoothly realized and how to promote its realization are separate issues. However, to think that the goal can be achieved simply by stamping "transfer only" on exchange allocation bills seems too simplistic! Exchange allocation bills after the August 13th Incident were originally transfer-only bills and could not be cashed, as clearly stipulated in the method of stabilizing finance. Moreover, the exchange allocation bills issued by banks are almost all fund transfer orders from the "Three Banks." The bills clearly have two horizontal lines printed on them, which is a clear indication that they are only for bank and money shop transfers. However, those who only care about personal gain and ignore the greater good—in fact, take risks—even dare to discount parallel-lined bills, so simply stamping the words "transfer only" is still ineffective!

Third, some people lament that since the exchange allocation system is being implemented and withdrawals of 法幣 are restricted, there should be no more discounting, otherwise the exchange allocation can still be exchanged for 法幣, and the result is the same as zero. I also share this feeling. If the financial authorities and the financial industry are determined, it will not be difficult to stop discounting. First, the bank and money shop's own customers must always pay with exchange allocation for those who deposit exchange allocation, and those who deposit 法幣 must not convert it into exchange allocation. Most member banks and money shops can consistently adhere to this. Second, exchange allocation bills, especially parallel-lined bills, cannot be discounted. Small money shops and silver shops that solicit business rashly will not be protected by law. (The Negotiable Instruments Law is sufficient to apply and does not require separate provisions.) After one or two lawsuits and suffering one or two major losses, everyone will naturally know where to stop. If you want to cut off the source of the problem, all shops that engage in discounting must ultimately pay the bills they receive to member banks and money shops for collection. If they agree or are ordered not to deal with them at that time, it will be enough to put them to death. Moreover, member banks and money shops have a significant responsibility to protect themselves and should not rashly accept parallel-lined bills of unknown origin.

Fourth, the new 50 million 法幣 exchange allocation implemented by the banking industry on July 4th is specially authorized by the Shanghai Banking and Money Shop Association to the Joint Reserve Committee to cope with the current environment. It has nothing to do with the financial authorities, let alone the illusory circulating notes. Second, although the new exchange allocation is set at 50 million 法幣, it does not mean that so much capital is added at once. It is flexible and adjusts according to the amount needed at any time. Banks and money shops issue checks daily for the balance of the new exchange allocation exchange, which is transferred by the exchange. According to our estimates, the capital of the new exchange allocation will not exceed 20 million 法幣 in the next few months.

The characteristics of the new exchange allocation are worth praising. Originally, the head offices of exchange allocation were not welcomed by the Bund banks because it was an abstract capital. The new exchange allocation is different. Its receipt must be based on real estate with the right to profit in the concession, company bonds and stocks with market value, and major commodities, after strict evaluation and then discounted as collateral. Therefore, it is a capital with definite preparation, and its preparation is no less than 法幣. In addition, representatives of foreign banks participated in it – in fact, the custodian committee and evaluation committee of the preparation committee were managed by the managers and experts of HSBC and Mercantile Bank – so there should be no problem with circulation among the Bund banks in the future. And the people of the country who own the new exchange allocation deposits have such solid guarantees, so they don’t need to worry about exchanging them for 法幣, or buying foreign exchange! As for the new exchange allocation being able to be remitted to the mainland as 法幣, the old exchange allocation is also superior, (because the capital from the mainland is remitted to Shanghai with a large exchange rate, so the exchange allocation funds are remitted to the mainland to receive 法幣, sometimes with a premium.) It is not enough to show the characteristics of the new exchange allocation.

### Review and Outlook of the Sino-Japanese Currency War (Conclusion)

— Anshi

Theory of Establishing a Gold-Based Currency

Since the revival of silver currency is impossible, and the new currency must be convertible to foreign exchange in order to resist 法幣, there is the proposal to establish a new 余 (Yu) currency. The method is to cooperate with countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, jointly contribute funds, establish a reserve, and issue foreign currencies denominated in British and American currencies to circulate in Central China, so that 法幣 can be easily defeated.

This is indeed a method, but in reality, it is absolutely impossible to realize.

First, if the reserve is centered on and dominated by Japanese forces, foreigners will never participate, because this would only be used by the Japanese side and endanger their own economic power; conversely, if it is centered on the United Kingdom and the United States, the financial power of Central China will be completely in the hands of the United Kingdom and the United States, and the Japanese financial power will be exhausted. Why would Japan launch this Sino-Japanese war at the cost of sacrifice?

Second, leaving aside international principles and morality, if the United Kingdom and the United States help the Japanese to defeat 法幣, it will inevitably endanger the future of China's resistance and further endanger its entire economic power in China. British and American financiers are not all blind, even if the Japanese are willing to lure them with the benefits of Central China, they will never abandon the big for the small and destroy themselves.

Establishment of New Banks and Issuance of New Currencies

With all roads blocked, and finally unable to do anything, it was decided to establish new banks and issue new currencies. This is the Huaxing Bank and the Huaxing 券 (coupon). This publication has already discussed Huaxing in detail, so I will not repeat it. However, we cannot forget that the poor only want to get rich, and the Japanese have always wanted to replace 法幣 with Huaxing 券 and use the 法幣 obtained to buy foreign exchange. If this were successful, China's 法幣 would be defeated and victory would ultimately belong to the Japanese yen.

Therefore, with a thunderous sound, the sale of foreign exchange on the black market in Shanghai was stopped, and the Japanese "new currency formulation policy" was shattered without leaving a trace. This move, in the end, in the Sino-Japanese currency war, made China win a great victory and Japan suffered another defeat. Because of this fatal blow, Huaxing 券 will inevitably fall into hell in the near future!

Conclusion

In short, since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese currency war, China has always been in the upper hand, calmly responding to the war, while Japan has been defeated in every battle. Now, it has suffered a fatal blow due to the suspension of the sale of foreign exchange on the black market in Shanghai. People without economic knowledge may think that this is because China's 法幣 has depreciated because it cannot buy foreign exchange, but this is only a one-sided view. At present, 法幣, Huaxing 券, and Japanese currency in Shanghai have all become unable to buy foreign exchange, but the foundation of 法幣 is extremely solid. Not only is there no tendency to expand in Shanghai, but there is a phenomenon of contraction. The circulation of division lines as currency is one proof of this. On the contrary, Japanese currency and its certain types of banknotes are undergoing extremely malignant expansion. In contrast, the value of 法幣 is much higher.

### A Word on the Issuance of Exchange Allocation to Fellow Traders

— I

Recently, there has been a move in the financial sector to issue exchange allocation to fellow traders. The details of the method are seen in the newspaper. It is generally planned that all banks and shops can provide collateral and apply to a financial institution for the issuance of exchange allocation to fellow traders. The total amount is temporarily set at 50 million yuan. This method can increase capital and adjust finance. In principle, there is nothing wrong with it, but if the implementation is not careful, the result may be contrary to the intention of the Ministry of Finance's telegram. The reason why the Ministry of Finance's telegram alone restricts deposits in Shanghai twice is:

(1) Tighten the currency to reduce capital flight and seek to stabilize the foreign exchange black market more easily.

(2) At the same time, make prices fall to a considerable level and stabilize society.

Our financial sector should understand this intention and implement it conscientiously. Regarding the aspect of loan pledges for goods: We should especially tighten up. The issuance of exchange allocation to fellow traders is a little loose and indiscriminate, which will inevitably lead to ample funds and promote speculation. Prices will rise again, forming a completely opposite direction to the intention of the Ministry of Finance's telegram. Now that Shanghai's customs tax revenue is no longer ours, it is not a question of feeding wolves with blood and flesh for the financial sector to promote a small number of exchange allocations to fellow traders to adjust legitimate industrial and commercial industries?

### On the Suggestion of Turning Shanghai into a Transfer Port

— Pan Chuandong

Some people advocate turning Shanghai into a transfer port in Shanghai to facilitate turnover. The intention is to improve the current exchange allocation system and turn exchange allocation into a checkbook note that cannot be discounted. However, we believe that there are two difficulties:

First, it is still impossible to solve the trade with foreign merchants. Therefore, this transfer note may not be able to (actually cannot) have the function of cutting heads; there is still no capital to pay foreign merchants, and foreign exchange cannot be exchanged for transfer notes. As a result, foreign trade is still not solved.

Second, it is impossible to prohibit the discounting of transfer notes. Because of the above reasons, the need for 法幣 is still very urgent. Cash holders can take the opportunity to make profits; and discounting businesses are scattered everywhere, and there are no officials who can prohibit them. As a result, there is no difference from the current exchange allocation system.

The above is only focused on general merchants. The difficulties for speculators do not need to be discussed. In fact, this restriction is only temporary in nature. But its reason, that capital escapes, may not be easy to eradicate. There is a certain party disturbing finance behind the scenes, so if there is no fundamental way, that even if it is changed to a checkbook code, it is still feared that new tricks will be invented in the future, and there will be no day of Ning.

In my opinion, speculation has been rampant in the past year. The unexpected increase in the profits of commercial houses is all due to foreign exchange. And the fact that foreign exchange has fallen to half of its previous value is an unprecedented fact in history. One of the reasons is that imports exceed exports. If we do not start by restricting imports and increasing exports, the general doubts about the devaluation of 法幣 will be difficult to eliminate, and eventually the shrinking of foreign exchange and the surge in prices will form a situation in which people cannot live. If the government can find a way to control imports and increase exports, there are still ways to deal with the number of applications slightly, otherwise financial stability is almost hopeless.

Yesterday, the cash price of bare gold on the black market was not traded due to the public holiday. It is said that the buying and selling outside the market were all waiting and watching, so the opening was not made, but the price was still around 2,600 yuan. The price of gold jewelry per tael in Shanghai was still 263 yuan at Da Tong Bank, 261 yuan at Xin Tong Bank, and 255 yuan for purchases. In addition, according to a London cable on July 1, the price of English pure gold rose by half a pence per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 6 pence and a half.

According to a London cable on July 1, the silver market was bought by India, and speculators were engaged in both trading and trading. The market was flat with little trading.

### The Future of the New Exchange Allocation System to be Implemented Tomorrow

— Mujie

When the August 13th war broke out, the Ministry of Finance implemented a method to stabilize finance. In order to maintain the funds needed by various industries, a joint lending committee of the Four Banks was set up. However, at that time, industry and commerce were stagnant, and people were moving inward, so the demand for funds was not urgent; and the lending committee still had direct and indirect lending to the financial industry, so the bank still had remedial measures for deposits. Today's situation is different. People from all over the world gather in the concessions, and banks are the hub for the storage and turnover of funds. After the second restriction on deposits on June 22, and after the sudden shrinking of foreign exchange, how can people not be more flustered and cause great panic, so that those who withdraw cash according to the amount are crowded and unbearable. Banks and shops feel that there are more expenses than income, and the lending committee has long since stopped lending directly to the financial industry, then its cash supply can only be sought from the bank and money industry reserve warehouse. The method of exchanging bank and shop exchange allocation deposits for 法幣 can be seen from the saying that "banks and shops must withdraw in advance to meet deposits". However, due to the new restrictions, the market still feels a lack of capital. Therefore, in order to adjust the capital supply of the industry and to meet the needs of industry and commerce, the issuance of exchange allocation to fellow traders is carried out again; and in order to facilitate the acceptance and delivery of exchange allocation to fellow traders, exchange allocation certificates for fellow traders are issued. This method, whether in theory or in fact, is the best way to increase capital in the Shanghai market. At present, the stability of Shanghai's finance and the supply of industrial and commercial funds should be carried out under the principle of shrinking the amount of 法幣 and expanding the amount of exchange allocation, so as to prevent the Japanese from obtaining 法幣 to buy foreign exchange and to support legitimate industry and commerce.

Now the fellow trader exchange allocation of the Silver Preparation Association and those constituted after August 13 have undergone differences in nature; the old exchange allocation was generated based on the supplementary method of stabilizing finance negotiated by the silver and money industry, and its substance is the liability of the silver and money industry, that is, the balance between the promissory notes issued by the silver and money industry and the Ministry of Commerce. The new exchange allocation (ie, the exchange allocation of fellow traders, hereinafter imitated) is a new capital generated by the property of various banks and shops as preparation. The old exchange allocation can only be transferred between fellow traders. The value of the assets that the owner of the exchange allocation funds can represent is a check-type check only. The new exchange allocation has the issuance of exchange allocation certificates for the convenience of acceptance and delivery. The Silver Preparation Association can pay for the exchange allocation check with exchange allocation certificates in addition to the transfer; the owner of the exchange allocation funds can use a currency-type exchange allocation certificate to represent the value of its assets. The old exchange allocation can only be circulated with checks, so its exercise is restricted by the check law. In addition to circulating with checks, the new exchange allocation can also be circulated with exchange allocation certificates, and the exchange allocation certificates can be exchanged for new certificates if they are dirty or broken, and except for the banks and shops that receive them, applications for loss reporting and stop payment are not allowed, because it is no different from banknotes. It is that the wooden quality of the new exchange allocation is far better than the old exchange allocation.

Although, the door to the spot cash exchange on the market is not closed due to the release of 22 million 法幣 of the old exchange allocation, and the exercise of the exchange allocation of fellow traders. What the bank pays to the exchange allocation depositor is the check or exchange allocation certificate of the fellow trader. If the owner of the new exchange allocation must use 法幣, he will inevitably go to the way of discounting. Furthermore, if the owner of the new exchange allocation needs to use 法幣, it is not for commercial purposes, but for capital flight, that is, for commercial purposes, but for the import of luxury goods that have nothing to do with people's livelihood and foreign exchange, which is also indirectly threatening the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai. The reason why the old exchange allocation was not valued was precisely because foreign commercial banks were unwilling to accept this kind of note, and the general import foreign companies also had to exchange it for 法幣 because it could not be directly converted into foreign exchange, so there was discounting. Now the new exchange allocation preparation inspection committee has the participation of representatives from the Foreign Commercial Bank Association, so that its credit can be promoted to the use of foreign companies and there should be no problem. However, the fact that the new exchange allocation cannot purchase foreign exchange is the same; and the new exchange allocation has not yet been implemented, and industries such as silk and satin, hardware, color printing, and refining have already published announcements that 法幣 will be used in general. If payment is made by exchange allocation, the discount will be based on the market price of the day. Although this move is not to deal with the upcoming new exchange allocation, the new exchange allocation will be paid to the exchange allocation depositor by the bank, which will at least hinder its circulation to a considerable extent, and it is feared that discounting will be difficult to stop.

Some say that after the new exchange allocation is exercised, it will inevitably cooperate with the money exchange industry to prohibit general small money shops and silver shops from engaging in exchange allocation discounting. It is necessary to know that if there is a need for discounting, how can empty words of prohibition be effective. Some think that even if it cannot be prohibited, the Silver Preparation Association will no longer come out to maintain it, and let the discount rate soar, and try to make it smooth to use by shrinking the 法幣 capital and circulating the exchange allocation capital. Although there will still be discounting for a while, but after a long time, the 法幣 capital shrinks, and those who engage in discounting will reach this point, even if there is a market, it will be extremely high, even if there is a transaction, it will be extremely small, and what kind of phenomenon will the new exchange allocation produce, which we currently predict; that is, the discount is gradually rising, and those legitimate commercial transactions, such as those that can find ways to avoid using cash to purchase goods, will not be willing to exchange 法幣 at a high price, (such as after the 6.22 restriction on deposit, the discount is high, but there is a price but no market), at this time, if there is still exchange allocation discounting, it must belong to improper purposes. Since those legitimate commercial transactions are unwilling to exchange 法幣 by exchange allocation to purchase goods, the principle of the current 法幣 transaction of industry and commerce will inevitably be difficult to adhere to, otherwise customers will leave in dismay, is it not giving up the opportunity to operate on their own! As a result, exchange allocation may be circulated smoothly, those foreign companies that also engage in import and export. After receiving the exchange allocation funds, they can use it to purchase local goods for export and generate foreign exchange, which is used to purchase foreign goods; if this is the case, those who specialize in import only have the receipt of exchange allocation, and those who specialize in export have the receipt of foreign currency or 法幣, and import foreign companies will inevitably go to the export. Foreign companies discount to purchase 法幣, give it to purchase foreign exchange, or directly purchase a certain amount of foreign exchange with more exchange allocation than using 法幣 to purchase. As a result, the increase or decrease in the value of imported foreign goods will depend on the amount of the value of exported local goods, so that trade can be balanced, or even if imports still exceed exports, it will inevitably form foreign investment. The phenomenon of trade balance or the formation of investment, coupled with the reduction of 法幣 capital and the increase of exchange allocation capital, Shanghai's black market foreign exchange on trade reduces other pressures at the time, and the market has the possibility of tending to stabilize and lengthen, The phenomenon of prices, although it will not fall temporarily due to the shrinking of 法幣 and the lengthening of foreign exchange, at least the trend of endless rise can be stopped.

However, the effectiveness of this prediction must be slow, and it is still built on the principle that exchange allocation can be circulated smoothly, and the market 法幣 can be contracted, and the smooth circulation of exchange allocation must be especially in the allocation and balance of exchange allocation and foreign exchange receipts and payments between foreign companies specializing in import and export. How to promote its implementation? Otherwise, foreign companies specializing in import only have the receipt of exchange allocation and cannot convert foreign exchange, and they will inevitably refuse to accept it after a long time. Foreign companies specializing in import will refuse to accept it first, and other industries will inevitably refuse to accept it later. Isn't it a pity to repeat the mistakes of the old exchange allocation! Therefore, I provide a stupid opinion as above.

### Seafood: Sea Cucumber Transactions are Quiet

Sea cucumbers have been near the sudden change in foreign exchange, and the cost has been high, with a huge increase of 20 to 30 yuan compared before and after. However, at the moment, it has not been sold, and transactions are quiet, but it will be difficult to combine the planning of goods that come later, so those shops that have a little bottom deposit do not want to sell it. Although it is not intentional to hoard goods, it is actually the environment that makes it so.

### Sugar Market: Diaoqing Rises Again

According to London cable, the sugar market fluctuated slightly yesterday. The recent August rose by one pence, to eight shillings and three pence and a half. The long-term slightly decreased, with December at six shillings and five pence, and March of next year at six shillings, five pence and two five.

### Medicinal Materials: Yizhiren Goods will be Out of Stock

Yizhiren's goods here have been sold out one after another, and they are about to be out of stock, and the source has been cut off again. At the moment, the going is very busy, and there is a lot of supply and demand, so the selling price has suddenly increased by 20 yuan, and it is unusually popular.

Sexual Health

### A Strict Distinction Should Be Made Between Asexuality and Impotence

— Yang Daonan, Graduate of Russian Loda Medical School

Young people in the early stages of development should understand that the onset of sexual arousal does not mean that the reproductive organs are fully mature. Therefore, sexual behavior should not be engaged in too early. As the saying goes, "Fruits picked unripe are not suitable for consumption." Therefore, early marriage is definitely not advisable. On the one hand, it hinders the development of the body, and on the other hand, it is not easy to have healthy children. Therefore, men and women should wait until after the age of twenty to marry. However, according to modern medical observations, the age difference between couples should be based on libido. This is because couples have the obligation to cohabitate. Whether their union is based on traditional familial ties or modern romantic relationships, sexual matters are the primary concern. Therefore, the union of a couple should be based on libido. A man's libido may not decline even in old age, while a woman's libido usually ceases around the age of forty-five. However, lacking libido is one thing, and being unable to engage in sexual activity is another. Although some men's libido does not decline even in old age, their ability to engage in sexual activity usually ceases around the age of sixty. This is because men are in an active position and require considerable energy to perform sexually, even if they have libido. Although women's libido declines around the age of forty-five, they can still engage in sexual activity beyond the age of sixty. This is because they are entirely in a passive position, like a machine. Even without libido, they can still engage in sexual activity. Therefore, it is not advisable, from a physiological and hygienic standpoint, for an old man to marry a young woman or for a young man to marry an old woman. This is because when an old man marries a young woman, the young woman's libido is at its peak and urgently seeks satisfaction, while the old man may have libido but lack the energy to engage in sexual activity. As a result, the old man exhausts his energy, while the young woman remains unsatisfied. The outcome is detrimental to both parties. The man may develop neurasthenia, back pain, kidney deficiency, and even death, while the woman may develop mental illness, such as sexual anesthesia, if this continues for a long time. However, the best remedy is to quickly increase energy and rejuvenate the reproductive function, eliminating kidney deficiency, impotence, premature aging, neurasthenia, and other ailments. I am a venereal disease specialist, and I know that the only way to achieve the aforementioned rejuvenation is to take the German male "Butikon," a preparation made from the essence of strong animal testicles, to fulfill your wishes. The female "Butikon" is a famous medicine for regulating menstruation, promoting fertility, and treating sexual anesthesia. Therefore, I dare to recommend it to patients.

Modern Medicine

### The Most Standard Gonorrhea Medication

— Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor

Gonorrhea is a disease that comes on fiercely and is not easily cured, causing patients great distress. People often rashly try various medications, hoping for a quick cure, but the results are invariably disappointing. The treatment of gonorrhea is indeed a difficult matter and should not be handled carelessly. This responsibility should only be entrusted to experienced physicians whose treatment methods can be effective. Unfortunately, many gonorrhea patients do not understand the harm they are doing to themselves and indiscriminately take inferior medications from the market, turning what could have been a quickly cured gonorrhea into a difficult one. To fundamentally resolve gonorrhea, it is crucial to choose the right doctor and medication, so that there is hope of curing the disease quickly. This is the secret to choosing the right gonorrhea treatment. In particular, attention should be paid to oral medications for gonorrhea, as they provide an opportunity for many financially disadvantaged patients to be cured.

However, the market is flooded with over-the-counter drugs, making it difficult for patients to choose. Based on my experience, only "Clinon," invented by Dr. Peter of Germany, can defeat all the unreasonable over-the-counter drugs on the market. This is because "Clinon" has been personally tested by the world's leading gonorrhea experts and proven to be uniquely successful in treating gonorrhea. After taking "Clinon," it exerts anti-gonococcal effects within a few hours, so it is actually effective within a few hours. Secondly, "Clinon" has a thorough bactericidal effect. Ordinary oral medications for gonorrhea are slow to take effect and only reach the superficial areas. If the gonococci have escaped into the deeper, more widespread areas, then general medications are ineffective. Thirdly, the drug is mild, so it is guaranteed to have no adverse side effects. Due to the above advantages, taking "Clinon" is always beneficial. It is effective in treating gonorrheal prostatitis, epididymitis, urethritis, cystitis, arthritis, etc., in a short period of time. For external use, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water," and women can use "Karexedi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories for even faster results.

### How to Subdue Pulmonary Tuberculosis

— Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang

Pulmonary tuberculosis is a terrible disease, and it is a very chronic disease. The treatment takes a long time and requires a lot of money. Therefore, some people say that tuberculosis is a rich man's disease, that is, only people with money are qualified to get this disease, and people without money only have a dead end. In fact, this is not the case. Regardless of any lung disease, based on my years of experience, "Lung Tonic" is indeed an effective agent for treating early second and third stage lung diseases. This is because this agent has the function of eliminating oxygen in lung diseases, causing the bacteria to lose their activity. Therefore, hemoptysis, chest pain, night sweats, and fever caused by tuberculosis can be relieved immediately. For relieving cough and eliminating phlegm, surgical operations are not necessary, and lung cavities can be repaired. Major European and American tuberculosis sanatoriums and experts all instruct patients to take this agent at home.

### The Health Problems of Young Men with Nocturnal Emission

— Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor

Nine out of ten young men experience nocturnal emission. Why is this? Although there is a distinction between physiological and pathological nocturnal emission, we doctors often find that those who lose their health due to nocturnal emission start with physiological nocturnal emission. This shows that if this condition is not paid attention to at all times, it can gradually become frequent, or even turn from nocturnal emission to spermatorrhea, then the situation has become dangerous.

Young men who masturbate can hardly avoid this condition. If the cause of the disease is not eradicated, even if they take medication for treatment, it will be difficult to restore their health. Those who indulge in masturbation must deeply reflect on this point. Especially young men who are just developing, every drop of their essence and blood is a major component for building brainpower and muscle, so it should not be wasted.

If nocturnal emission is not treated early, it will inevitably lead to neurasthenia and may also cause other venereal diseases. The treatment of this condition should emphasize both nourishment and medication. Patients should strictly prohibit excessive sexual activity, abstain from alcohol, and get sufficient sleep. If they can perform local cold water friction, it will be even more beneficial.

As for drug treatment, the best is "Naires Nocturnal Emission Tablets," which can completely cure the disease. However, if neurasthenia or sexual dysfunction is caused by prolonged nocturnal emission, then "Butikon" should also be taken to nourish the deficiency.

Gonorrhea Forum

### Special Treatment for Acute Gonorrhea

— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

Acute gonorrhea is often unbearable due to its excruciating pain, leading to rash treatment. As a result, although the pain is temporarily reduced or subsided, this is merely a form of anesthetic pain relief. Before long, the pain becomes even more severe than before. At this point, patients begin to realize that their condition has worsened and consider changing their course of action. Therefore, when gonorrhea first begins, do not entrust it to mediocre physicians, lest the originally curable acute gonorrhea be mistreated by doctors who do not understand the principles of gonorrhea, who perform surgery indiscriminately and prescribe inferior medications, seeking only immediate relief and forgetting the harm to patients in the future. Is this not a predicament caused by patients' carelessness in seeking medical treatment and choosing medication?

Acute gonorrhea mostly occurs after intercourse with unclean prostitutes. After an incubation period of about three to four days to five to six days, prodromal symptoms appear, such as stinging and burning pain during urination. These are all phenomena of the prodromal period. Afterward, these symptoms become more severe, and the urethral opening becomes red and swollen, and the glans and foreskin become terribly swollen. Purulent secretions clog the urethra, making urination very painful. However, this pain is actually a physiological reaction and should not be anesthetized rashly, which would reduce resistance. The fundamental way to relieve pain is to eradicate the gonococci. For this treatment, only the gonorrhea-specific drug "Clinon" should be taken, along with German static electricity therapy. This is because "Clinon" can kill gonococci and eliminate inflammation caused by gonococci after taking it. Only by quickly killing the gonococci can the pain of acute gonorrhea be fundamentally resolved. To achieve this goal of relieving pain, fighting gonorrhea, and reducing inflammation, "Clinon" and static electricity therapy must be adopted as reliable methods. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 appointment tickets will be given out each day, with each ticket costing only 5 jiao. A free copy of the "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases," worth 1 yuan, will be given away.

### English Female Musician Performs

The affairs of Western theaters are very different from those in China. Celebrated members of the troupe are treated with respect by outsiders, unlike the performers in China, who are generally seen as mere itinerant entertainers. Now, a newly arrived English female musician of great renown, named Arabella Goddard, has come to Shanghai. She is touring the world for pleasure and sightseeing. When she performs her skills in the places she visits, she often dislikes that the income is less than one-hundredth of what she earns in England, and only sees it as a way to subsidize her travel expenses. It is said that she will perform at the Western theater in Shanghai for several days. The traffic will be heavy, and it will be a grand occasion.

### New Style Rickshaws

The two-wheeled rickshaw is the newest invention in Shanghai. These new style vehicles can be seen on the main streets of the concession. These vehicles come from Japan and are called jinrikisha, which were invented a few years ago. The people of that country found them useful, so they widely used them. There are already over a thousand in Yokohama. The drivers pull them very quickly, and they can almost keep pace with horse-drawn carriages. Compared to the local wheelbarrows, they have advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantage is that they can only carry one person; the advantage is that they are more convenient for the passenger. Since this vehicle is crude, many dignified people disdain to ride in it. Those who cannot afford to keep a sedan chair at home often find it inconvenient to travel. Now that there are rickshaws, it will be much more convenient for these people.

### Chinese-Western Dictionary Completed

Yesterday, I received a Chinese-Western dictionary from Mr. Schereschewsky. The book contains over four thousand Chinese characters, arranged according to radicals. Under each character, there is an English explanation, which is very detailed and concise. The format of this book is very clear and will be very helpful for those who study Western learning. The book has been deposited at Lao Taixing and Biefa foreign firms for sale.

To be published tomorrow: Notification of ship fare collection; Description of the circus.

### Poetry Recitation in Shanghai

— Lin Xiao

The first poetry recitation in Shanghai was held in a private living room upstairs. Those present included poets, composers, and playwrights, because poetry recitation requires musicality and theatrical movements to enhance its effectiveness.

The poems recited were: Bai Shu's "Taierzhuang," Feng Yuanjun's "Withdrawal," Shi Ling's "Shadow," Pushkin's "Gypsies," as well as Xi Jin's "Rainy Spring Day" and Hua Ling's "Turtle." Other songs included "Nostalgia" (Camel Song, Zhang Hao's music), "I Come from the Countryside" (same composer and lyricist); records included Old Folks at Home, as well as a record of Keats's poetry recitation.

That day's poetry recitation can only be regarded as an experiment in poetry recitation in Shanghai. Based on the recitation of various poets, my overall opinion is: because the poems of each poet are not very popular, many words that even I, an "intellectual," do not recognize, how can the "deaf ears" of the masses hear them? Also, Shi Ling's "Shadow," with its profound meaning and mournful tone, is even more unsuitable as a basic line for popularizing poetry recitation. Secondly, Miss Shen, who recited Bai Shu's "Taierzhuang" that day, undoubtedly achieved great success, because she was able to grasp all (or at least most) of the emotions of the poet when he wrote "Taierzhuang"; on the contrary, a certain female poet was much worse when reading Pushkin's "Gypsies." From this, we can know that to recite other people's poems, one must at least grasp the emotions of the poem. If one recites one's own poems, then the tone must be paid very close attention to (this is also one of the important conditions when reciting other people's poems.)

I have already said that that day's poetry recitation can only be regarded as an experiment in the poetry recitation movement in Shanghai. Because it is an experiment, I would like to offer some more suggestions: in the future, if we hold poetry recitation again, I think everyone should discuss it after each poem is recited; for example, whether the poem itself is suitable for recitation, whether the tone and movement of the recitation of the poem are appropriate, and so on. Here, I think we should invite the so-called masses who do not understand poetry to listen carefully to the poetry recitation and then solicit their opinions, which will be of great help to the progress of the Shanghai poetry recitation movement.

In addition to the aforementioned gathering of "poets, composers, and playwrights," there is another type of poetry recitation in Shanghai that is worth mentioning: a public recitation in front of a crowd of four or five hundred people at a certain celebration. The poems recited that day included Gorky's "Sunrise and Sunset" and Xu Xingzhi's "Lighthouse" (published in the poetry journal "I Sing"). The former was recited by Miss Shen, who recited "Taierzhuang." Since poetry recitation is still a "stranger" to the masses in Shanghai, the "audience" listened in surprising silence. The latter, "Lighthouse," although the poem itself is a narrative poem and is quite suitable for recitation, the reciter's recitation skills were too poor, and the "Lighthouse" was very long. So the audience became impatient, some quietly left before the recitation was over, and some talked to each other.

The poetry recitation movement in Shanghai does not seem to be outstanding, but poetry recitation in Shanghai is still a tender sprout. Moreover, the climate in Shanghai is very harmful to that tender sprout. Therefore, I have great respect for those two poetry recitations and hold unlimited hope.

This tender sprout will surely flourish into a strong tree, as long as our poetry workers continue to work hard!

### On the Front Lines

— Sheng Dan

— Field Notes

After a considerable period of stalemate, the war on the southern section of the Pinghan Railway has suddenly become active again. Their sole objective, it goes without saying, is to threaten Wuhan; however, the line from Gushi, thanks to the valiant resistance of the ××× Division, has not changed at all. The so-called abandonment of Xinyang is simply like seeing a ghost in broad daylight. We originally intended to return to Anhui from Shangqiu, but upon hearing the news of the counterattack, we resumed our original plan to go to the front lines and then transfer to Anhui. Once we reached Xinyang County, we were reminded of the scenery of Jiangnan. Among the crisscrossing fields, golden rice paddies were everywhere, and the farmers were harvesting. The sound of the scythes cutting rice and the flowing water formed a symphony. Originally, Xinyang was located in the upper reaches of the Huai River, and the entire area was a vast plain. The Dabie Mountains to the south were distantly arched in a row, and the Pingjing, Jiuli, and Wusheng passes stood majestically on top, with a very dangerous terrain. The Pinghan Railway tunnel runs beside Wusheng Pass, just like the gateway to Xinyang. Jiugong Mountain is located north of Jiuli Pass. Therefore, the flames of war burned in the suburbs of this strategically important area, which was a must-win place for the military.

The air in the countryside still seemed very peaceful; but as soon as we went to the front lines, we immediately felt the tension. The roar of field guns shook the earth, and transport vehicles flew back and forth, weaving through the trees. Brave armed fighters, some marching in formation, their gleaming bayonets emitting a strong light, some walking back and forth in the fields, singing marching songs, and some drawing water by the stream to wash their battle clothes. Groups of war horses were happily grazing on the grass, swinging their tails, and making rustling noises. In short, everything on the front lines makes you feel a different kind of mood, and deeply feel your own insignificance, ordinariness, and cowardice.

As we walked towards a village close to the front lines, hunger burned in our bellies. Miss Wu was searching everywhere for corn (maize) to solve the problem of dinner, while an old farmer in the village had already sent a basket of boiled eggs. "If you want to eat rice porridge, you have to wait for it to cook," he said sincerely, a kind smile appearing from the wrinkles on his forehead.

"I'm sorry, eggs are very good!"

"Are you not afraid of artillery fire?" Old Yao asked casually.

"Afraid? What are we afraid of? It can destroy our bodies, but it can't kill our patriotic souls!" The old farmer, perhaps a philosopher, answered Old Yao's question in such a humorous way.

As dusk approached, the artillery fire became more intense, and the small mortars were also roaring. The whizzing bullets streaked past like meteors. At the same time, the sound of the bombs exploding on the ground made people feel particularly excited. We watched the division commander Zhou pointing at the map and issuing orders in the division headquarters; on his face was an expression of indifference. "Wasting bullets as much as possible, that's their specialty!" he said, chewing on the dishes.

### Life

— Ai Ding

Fanciful dreams,

Unattainable wishes.

The smelly leather bag of experience,

Can never follow the painting.

Destiny wants to soar,

Trying to get too high,

Still falls into the pond of sorrow.

The process of life is a desert,

Perhaps there is grass.

Dandelions sow seeds by the wind,

The flame cannot rely on the long stream to spread widely.

Unbreakable pebbles,

Cannot cross the ocean,

A broken heart

How can you walk on the wide road.

Having traveled all over the world,

There is only one lighthouse on earth.

### The Life of the Great Ukrainian Poet Shevchenko (Part 1)

— Chishou

Turgenev, in his masterpiece "Rudin," deliberately used an old stubborn character to scold the literature of Little Russia, which represented the general opinion of the old Russian era. But in fact, that "backward" nation, which had been oppressed for a long time, also produced many great writers. Gogol, who occupies the most important page in the history of Russian literature, was actually a Ukrainian. However, there are many writers whose works have not been widely disseminated and are simply unknown to the general public, but are actually important writers in their nation. Now I want to introduce a figure whose name can occasionally be seen in literary history but whose life is rarely described in detail.

This figure is the great Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko.

On February 25, 1814, this poet was born in a village near the Dnieper. His parents were serfs, and they both died when he was eight years old. The first school he attended was a private church school, where he suffered abuse and hard labor. But he liked to read and write, which surprised his drunken teacher. After his drunken teacher died, he went to live with a painter in a neighboring village under his protection. He wanted to learn to paint, but the painter took his hand, looked at it, shook his head, and that was it. Finally, he could no longer bear the painter's abuse and fled back to his own village, where he ended up herding cattle.

However, fate pulled him in another direction. The master he worked for was a Polish nobleman who actually "took a liking" to him and asked him to be his personal attendant. This gave him the opportunity to visit major cities such as Warsaw, Vilnius, and St. Petersburg. His master also saw his talent in painting. In Warsaw, he had him study under Lempi, a famous painter at the time; in Petersburg, he sent him to a decorative painter named Ohiriaev. He worked very hard, day and night. Because he went to the park to sketch, he was noticed by a Ukrainian painter, Sonehenko, and immediately, he gained a new friend. And it was this new friend who led him to the great painter Brulov. His fate had a turning point. Brulov truly recognized his genius and decided to have him study at the Academy of Fine Arts. But he was a serf, and according to the rules, he was not qualified to enter the academy. Fortunately, his new friend was very enthusiastic, so he and the famous poet Joukovski went to his noble master to intercede and discuss redeeming him. Joukovski painted a portrait and sold it at a high price. Joukovski was the emperor's tutor, and his portrait was indeed bought by the royal family. So two thousand five hundred rubles were obtained, and Shevchenko was free.

After entering the Academy of Fine Arts, he soon amazed his peers with the demeanor of a great painter. But he was not satisfied with the visual arts under his pen, and he also began to write poetry. According to his diary, he wanted to write poetry for the sake of his motherland, Ukraine. He wanted to temper the Ukrainian language into rhythmic verse and also make it singable for the people. He said: "I know that the history of painting is my profession and the source of my future livelihood, but when I was studying the mysteries of art under the guidance of the immortal Brulov, I admired poetry——that poetry that did not earn me a penny and even took away my freedom!" Because his poetry protected Ukraine, it also offended the Tsar, and later he became a criminal because of this.

The time was 1845. He had completed his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts and returned to Ukraine. Kyiv (the capital of Ukraine) University had already decided to hire him as a professor of charcoal drawing, but unexpectedly, an unfortunate incident occurred.

At that time, a group of outstanding figures gathered in Kyiv, including the famous historian Kostomarov and the historian and writer Hulak——they were all leaders of the Ukrainian youth at the time, and they were organizing a group there called the "Cyril and Methodius Society," whose purpose was to liberate Ukraine from the Tsar's rule and move towards the future of an autonomous state.

### "Open Door"

### Salted Pork Soup with Tofu

— Pin Pin

Once, I discussed creative methods with several friends. We believed that Shanghai's literature and art were too depressed, lacking works with vitality; there were many reasons, but the main one was the harsh environment of Shanghai. The external pressure was too great, literary and artistic workers lost their freedom, and even if they had passionate and exciting things to say, they had to stop halfway in order to protect literary publications and even their own lives. As a result, empty and sentimental works gradually increased, and Shanghai's literature and art seemed to be on a path of decline.

So we wanted to suggest a creative method to adapt to the environment of Shanghai, while not obliterating the primary meaning of national identity in literature. After thinking for a while, a friend said:

"Let's use the method of salted pork soup with tofu."

I felt it was abrupt and asked this friend what kind of method this creative method was. He replied:

"Don't we often eat this kind of economical soup when we eat? It tastes very good, but you have to be careful when you eat it. When the waiter brings up the salted pork and tofu soup, if someone impatient picks up a spoon and sends it into their mouth, it will surely burn their tongue and make their throat ache. Originally, the bowl of soup is lifeless, without a wisp of hot air, but the heat is hidden under the oil, without showing any signs, and has not disappeared at all. -- Do you understand? I won't say anymore, let you write the article."

In fact, although I wrote this article, it is difficult to elaborate. His analogy is very clear. Adding more would be uninteresting. However, I think it's okay to quote a few more sentences.

First, I think this salted pork soup with tofu is a good creative method. It is of course better in Shanghai, and can also be used occasionally in the inland. The inland has a full freedom of air. Both encouragement and criticism can be expressed frankly, and the effect is also great. If it is all the same, to prevent being disgusted, salted pork soup with tofu is a good seasoning, for example, like "Mr. Hua Wei" which is somewhat similar to this, and very popular. As for Shanghai, this place should be developed everywhere: on the one hand, it will not cause superficial conflicts with the environment, and on the other hand, the potential power of literature and art will be preserved. Finally, as in physics, static energy will be transformed into kinetic energy.

Second, salted pork soup with tofu is a creative method that is not easy to succeed. The most important thing is the selection of content. Recently, I have seen some works that often write an article because of one thing (very ordinary things, such as sea water, moonlight, souvenirs from lovers, products from hometowns, etc.), saying what limits my loneliness, I saw it and thought of the fall of my hometown, oh, oh, an article is completed. It looks like there is no difference from this tofu soup, but after careful investigation, these tofu have really become tofu, without bones and blood, just an empty piece. This is waste, a disguised skeleton. Therefore, tofu is just an analogy, in fact, it should be transformed into a life form with bones, blood and flesh. In terms of form, it should not be draped in too gorgeous prose. We only want economical and simple salted pork soup, not chicken juice and shark fin soup. Only salted pork soup is a food for the public, and our literature is dedicated to the public. If the form is too elegant, the internal heat will be completely eliminated; readers will be fascinated by the appearance and will not seek it deep inside.

Third, salted pork soup with tofu is originally a method that is outwardly dry and inwardly strong, solid but not flashy. The outside looks very cold, plain and gentle, and the inside is very hot, distinctive and stimulating, easy to taste and difficult to let go, a smiling tiger, a sword hidden in the fish, the role of literature is exhausted. The spirit that holds the creative method is symbolism (active). I may have the opportunity to talk about it. Here, I hope that the salted pork and tofu-like literature of Shanghai will be served bowl by bowl, so that those who seek spiritual food can have a full meal.

Commentary

### Following the Ministry of Finance's Telegraphic Restrictions on Withdrawals

— Yonghua

After August 13th, the Ministry of Finance issued the "Measures for Stabilizing Finance in Extraordinary Times" and its supplementary measures, and the scope of implementation was not limited to Shanghai; even in Shanghai, at the beginning of the implementation of these measures, people were at ease. At that time, so-called remittances and legal tender were both used as chips in general transactions that did not involve foreign exchange, and the legal price was no different. The only difference was that for small daily expenses, it was inconvenient to use remittances and transfers, so legal tender had to be used as a medium of exchange. The discounting of remittances and bills of exchange was never said to be non-existent, or to be distinguished from the clearing power of legal tender, and to lower its value could truly be described as disrupting finance. This was because there were not as many people trying to profit from the national crisis as there are today, and in the situation at the time, the "Measures for Stabilizing Finance" issued by the Ministry of Finance were still generally recognized as having legal effect, and few dared to disagree, so they could achieve great results for a time. Unexpectedly, since the formation of an isolated island in one corner of the land, funds have become more concentrated and lack of use. The excited hearts of the past have gradually become cold, and then so-called foreign exchange black markets have risen up, raising their eyebrows and winking to exchange foreign exchange for legal tender. The demand for foreign exchange has continued to rise, and the natural economic trends and their causes are not something that [I] wish to discuss in depth. Only from a legal perspective, the previous "Measures for Stabilizing Finance" could be implemented in the inland for a long time without hindrance. Why is it that they have gradually become ineffective only in Shanghai, and the Ministry of Finance must use the recent telegraphic restrictions again to remedy them? This must be attributed to the silver and money industry's joint preparatory committee's publicly set exchange rate for remittances and the court's judgment that remittances do not have clearing power, which some dare to disregard.

In the past, when the black market discount rate for remittances reached seventy or eighty yuan, the silver and money industry's joint preparatory committee, entrusted by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, came out to refuse to take responsibility for stabilization, and it cannot be said that the motivation was not good. However, according to the original measures of the Ministry of Finance, its main purpose was to restrict the arbitrary acquisition of foreign exchange, and the legitimate need for foreign exchange was still being continuously supplied. Therefore, those who turned to the black market for foreign exchange because the state refused to supply foreign exchange could not be said to be legitimate. The joint preparatory committee turned remittances between colleagues into legal tender that could be used to cash out foreign exchange on the black market, setting a public standard. As a result, the effectiveness of stabilizing finance was completely lost, and those who refused to accept remittances had a reason to do so.

Judicial judgments should abide by laws and regulations and make appropriate interpretations to apply them; the so-called laws and regulations should include the codes passed through the legislative process and the orders mentioned in Article 76 of the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage. The "Measures for Stabilizing Finance" issued by the Ministry of Finance after August 13th cannot be said to not comply with the orders mentioned in Article 76 of the Provisional Constitution during the period of political tutelage. The court should not refuse to cite them, and the appropriate interpretation in the citation should explore the overall purpose of the measures and clarify them, and should not take excerpts out of context and have a superficial understanding of the wording. Once there was a case where foreign merchants leasing land refused to pay rent with remittances and were involved in litigation. The judgment was based on the reason that remittances were limited to use between colleagues and that rent must be paid in legal tender. However, it is not known that the measures set by the ministry, remittances limited to colleagues, refer to their transfer through colleagues for clearance, and not to the act of exchanging them for legal tender; they do not mean that they cannot be regarded as chips, circulated among people outside the silver and money industry, or that the legal price of this chip should be reduced compared to legal tender. Those foreign merchants came to make profits, and they were indifferent to the stability of our finance and the maintenance of national policies. It is not worth deeply criticizing them for being unwilling to accept remittances and trying to seek fortune through litigation. The judicial officials failed to explore the true meaning of laws and regulations to correct their mistakes, and took excerpts out of context, denying that remittances had the same clearing power as legal tender. This was fueling the flames, giving foreign merchants who refused to use them a plausible argument, and giving those who tried to profit from the national crisis a great boost. The accumulated situation has become the current situation, which cannot be said to be an unprecedented regret.

The past is gone, and the Ministry of Finance's new telegraphic measures restricting the withdrawal of deposits have been implemented again; the scope is limited to Shanghai, and the measures do not affect the collection and delivery in the inland. Those who withdraw more than 500 yuan of legal tender per week are still limited to payment by remittance, which is exclusively for the use of interbank accounts, and those who have deposits transferred to the inland are not restricted. This kind of measure is only to maintain the finance of this city, so that those who try to profit from the national crisis do not have the opportunity to cash out foreign currency with a large amount of legal tender. Therefore, large amounts of payments of more than 500 yuan are all carried out by remittance and transfer, which clearly means that there is no discrimination against remittances, denial of their clearing power, or reduction of their legal price. If we continue to hold on to the previous erroneous interpretations in judgments, saying that they are only limited to interbank use, and doubt that they have the same clearing power as legal tender, then most depositors are not the so-called silver and money industry, and fundamentally the silver and money industry should not be allowed to pay remittances to their depositors as a substitute for clearing. Saying that remittances received by depositors from the silver and money industry cannot be paid to people outside the silver and money industry to clear their debts is absurd in theory and beyond compare. If this statement is followed, then all transactions must be circulated in legal tender, the need for legal tender will increase, the use of remittances will become narrower, and those who are madly trying to profit from the national crisis will beautify their names as stabilization and regulation, and their activities will inevitably be even more rampant than before the telegraphic restrictions, which will unfortunately only harm themselves and benefit others. How to prevent its drawbacks and seek to exert the effectiveness of the telegraphic restrictions is what is hoped for from the court, the silver and money industry's joint preparatory committee, and other parties to change their discriminatory attitude towards remittances.

Research and Criticism

### Discussion of Article 1052, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 4 of the Civil Code

— Zhou Da'yun

Article 1052, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 4 of our country's new Civil Code states: "A wife abuses the husband's lineal ascendants, or is abused by the husband's lineal ascendants, making it unbearable to live together." This subparagraph is also one of the statutory grounds for divorce. There is one application scenario:

(1) If the wife abuses the husband's lineal ascendants, the husband may request a divorce from the wife.

(2) If the wife is abused by the husband's lineal ascendants, the wife may request a divorce from the husband. This is completely self-evident and does not need to be elaborated. However, upon careful examination of the meaning of this subparagraph, it is all stipulated from the wife's perspective. The position of the husband is not mentioned at all. Suppose the following two situations occur, it will be impossible to rely on:

(1) If the husband abuses the wife's lineal ascendants (can the wife also request a divorce from the husband based on the provisions of this subparagraph?)

(2) If the husband is abused by the wife's lineal ascendants (can the husband also request a divorce from the wife based on the provisions of this subparagraph?)

How should the above two situations be resolved? After careful research, if an analogous interpretation is made, it can of course constitute grounds for divorce. If an analogous interpretation is not made, then it is definitely not grounds for divorce. The difference between the two is very large, and much deliberation is required. Some say that when a wife marries and becomes a member of the husband's family, she takes the husband's domicile as her domicile, and naturally has the possibility of living together with the husband's lineal ascendants. Families in our country have been like this for years. As for the wife's lineal ascendants, they rarely live with the husband. Therefore, the Civil Code, Paragraph 4, does not stipulate it. It is not known that in the usual marriage, the wife takes the husband's domicile as her domicile. As for a matrilocal marriage, it is the opposite. The husband takes the wife's domicile as his domicile (see the provisions of the second half of Article 1002 of the Civil Code, Family Law). Why are you biased towards one side? It can be seen that the provisions of this subparagraph seem to be inadequate and there may be obstacles when applied. It is suggested that in the next amendment to the Civil Code, this subparagraph should be changed to: "If one spouse abuses the other spouse's lineal ascendants, or is abused by the other spouse's lineal ascendants, making it unbearable to live together." This would be more universal. I don't know what contemporary legal experts think.

Editor's note: Article 1052, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code stipulates that "One spouse may request a divorce from the court only if the other spouse has one of the following circumstances." Therefore, the circumstances in each subparagraph of the second paragraph are mutually applicable to both spouses, rather than one-sided. In terms of application, difficulties such as those mentioned by Mr. [Zhou] will not arise. However, the wording of Subparagraph 4 of the second paragraph of this article focuses on the wife's side, which is indeed not good. Now Mr. Zhou intends to amend and correct it, which is indeed very appropriate.

### Civil Procedure Law: Applications That Parties Can Make and Rulings Thereon (Fourth Reading, Every Eighth Issue)

— Shen Tianbao

The above are the applications that parties are explicitly permitted to make under our current Civil Procedure Law. However, the applications parties can make are not limited to these. If, within the scope permitted by law, it is discovered that there is a need for an application to be made, it can still be made at any time, in order to swiftly achieve the goal of an appropriate judgment. As for the court, upon receiving an application from a party, it will make a ruling either granting or rejecting it. The difference between a ruling and a judgment is that the former pertains to disputes arising in procedure, while the latter pertains to disputes arising in substance. The former does not require oral arguments, while the latter does. Dissatisfaction with the former can lead to an appeal, while dissatisfaction with the latter can lead to a direct appeal. According to our current Civil Procedure Law, except for rulings rejecting a claim or rulings on disputed claims that must include reasons, the rest do not need to include reasons. It is sufficient to explain the content so that the parties can understand. Rulings that are announced do not need to be served, and it is sufficient to record them in the case file. According to Article 230 of the Civil Procedure Law, except where this law stipulates that a judgment should be used, a ruling is used. Therefore, the opportunity to use a ruling is quite extensive. The above-mentioned applications can all be approved or rejected by ruling. In addition, if the court believes that it should dispose of a certain action ex officio, it can also do so by ruling. For clarity and immediate visibility, the rulings are classified below according to their nature:

(1) Rulings for which appeals are explicitly prohibited:

(1) Rulings designating jurisdiction. (23) (2) Rulings rejecting an application to transfer the lawsuit. (28) (3) Rulings that deem the challenge of a judge to be justified. (37) (4) Rulings rejecting an application to correct a judgment. (232) (5) Rulings permitting the change or addition of a claim, or rulings stating that a claim is not a change or addition. (258) (6) Rulings that deem the rejection of an expert witness to be justified. (333) (7) Rulings granting the preservation of evidence. (371) (8) Rulings rejecting an application for mediation. (410) (9) Rulings by the original court’s presiding judge to suspend the execution of the original ruling during an appeal. (488) (10) Rulings by the appellate court to suspend the execution of the original ruling during an appeal, or to make other necessary dispositions. (488) (11) Rulings rejecting an application to issue a payment order. (509) (12) Rulings by the court with jurisdiction on the appropriateness of preliminary injunctions. (533) (13) Rulings declaring interdiction. (605) (14) Rulings rejecting an application to revoke interdiction. (620)

(2) Rulings for which appeals are explicitly permitted: (1) Rulings regarding the participation of a third party in the lawsuit. (60) (2) Rulings ordering court clerks and other personnel to bear expenses incurred due to litigation actions. (89) (4) Rulings regarding the return of security deposits. (105) (6) Rulings rejecting an application for service by public notice. (144) (7) Rulings rejecting a declaration to assume the lawsuit. (177) (8) Rulings ordering litigation to proceed. (178) (9) Rulings regarding the suspension of litigation proceedings. (178) (10) Rulings regarding the revocation of the suspension of litigation. (187) (11) Rulings imposing a fine on a witness for failure to appear. (303) (12) Rulings on the appropriateness of refusing to testify. (310) (13) Rulings imposing a fine on a witness for refusing to produce a document. (311) (14) Rulings imposing a fine on a third party who fails to comply with an order to produce a document without justifiable reason. (349) (15) Rulings imposing a fine on a third party who fails to comply with an order to produce an object for inspection without justifiable reason. (367) (16) Rulings regarding provisional attachment. (524) (17) Rulings regarding evidence of security deposit for provisional disposition requests (371) (19) Rulings imposing a fine on a party who fails to appear on the mediation date. (414) (20) Rulings by the appellate court rejecting the appeal as unlawful or revoking or modifying the original ruling because the appeal is justified. (483) (21) Rulings regarding necessary dispositions that may be ordered before the declaration of interdiction to protect the person and property of the person subject to interdiction, and rulings revoking the dispositions. (602) (22) Rulings rejecting an application for interdiction. (603)

(3) Rulings that can be appealed within five days: (1) Rulings rejecting an application to challenge a judge; (36) (2) Rulings regarding an application for an order to provide security for litigation costs, (100) (3) Rulings regarding an application for legal aid, (105) (4) Rulings regarding the revocation of legal aid, (113) (5) Rulings that deem the rejection of an expert witness to be unjustified, (333)

(4) Rulings that cannot be appealed during the litigation process: (1) Rulings appointing a special agent, (51) (2) Rulings on a party's withdrawal from litigation, (64) (3) Rulings prohibiting a non-lawyer from acting as a litigation agent, (68) (4) Rulings changing or extending the date, (159) (5) Rulings extending or shortening the time period, (163) (6) Rulings rejecting objections filed after the deadline, (196) (7) Rulings on objections to the presiding judge's direction of the litigation, (201) (8) Rulings regarding whether to permit or prohibit questioning of witnesses and objections arising therefrom, (320) (9) Rulings ordering the opposing party to produce documents, (343) (10) (11) Rulings ordering the opposing party to produce an object for inspection, (367) (11) Rulings ordering the opposing party to produce documents, (347) (12) Rulings ordering a third party to produce an object for inspection. (367) (13) Rulings to preserve evidence ex officio. (372) (14) Rulings rejecting an application for a judgment based on the default of one party. (386) (15) Rulings rejecting an application to supplement provisional execution. (386)

(5) Rulings that can be appealed based on their nature: (1) Rulings by the defendant to allow the transfer of the lawsuit. (118) (2) Rulings on litigation expenses for lawsuits that are terminated without a judgment. (90) (3) Rulings determining the amount of litigation costs. (91) (4) Rulings rejecting the plaintiff's claim because they did not provide security. (101) (5) Rulings correcting a judgment. (232) (6) Rulings rejecting an application to supplement a judgment. (233) (7) Rulings rejecting an unlawful lawsuit. (23) (8) Rulings rejecting a counterclaim. (260) (9) Rulings by each trial court rejecting an unlawful appeal. (441) (10) Rulings by the second instance court rejecting an unlawful appeal. (453) (11) Rulings rejecting the re-trial of the lawsuit. (496) (12) Rulings declaring execution after the period specified in the payment order has passed. (513) (13) After a payment order has been issued, rulings rejecting the debtor's objection. (514) (14) Rulings ordering the obligee to provide security before making a provisional attachment, (522) (15) Rulings regarding the revocation of a provisional attachment, (525) (16) Rulings regarding the revocation of a provisional disposition, (529) (17) Rulings regarding permission to publicize the notice, (236) (18) Rulings rejecting an application for a judgment on proprietary rights, (543) (19) Rulings revoking a prohibition of payment order, (563) (20) Rulings imposing a fine on a party or legal representative for failing to appear, (572) (21) Rulings appointing a special agent for an adopted child, (581) (22) Rulings revoking interdiction, (619) The above is a brief overview of the rulings stipulated in the current Civil Procedure Law. If we combine this with the aforementioned applications that parties can make, then the difficulties encountered in handling the entire Civil Procedure Law do not lie in the filing of the lawsuit and the judgment, but rather in the applications and the rulings. This is because the filing of the lawsuit and the judgment are merely the beginning and end of the Civil Procedure Law. Sometimes the case proceeds smoothly and ends quickly, without any difficulty. As for the applications and rulings, they are all disputes that arise in the middle of the litigation. Sometimes, side issues arise and spread, making them difficult to resolve. Just as one wave subsides, another rises. The litigant suffers from the pain of a case hanging unresolved, not knowing what to do. The court has the concern of attending to one thing and neglecting another, unable to cope. How to utilize the provisions of the law, not to abandon legitimate claims, and also to prevent the abuse of delaying litigation, is what we sincerely hope for. (End)

Digest of Judgments

Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court

Weighing evidence and determining facts is the authority of the court of first instance. If the review and determination is not far removed from the law, it cannot be criticized by empty words by the parties. (Case No. 54 of Shang Zi [Appeal] of the Republic of China, 28th Year)

According to the payment of a price, it belongs to monetary debt, and fundamentally there is no issue of impossibility of performance. (Case No. 65 of Shang Zi [Appeal] of the Republic of China, 28th Year)

Legal Queries

In the spring of the 24th year of the Republic of China, I rented a one-room bungalow from A, stating that the monthly rent was seven yuan in legal tender. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, although I have been displaced, I have paid the rent as usual without interruption. Unexpectedly, A recently planned to rent the house to someone else, claiming that he could get 15 yuan in rent per month and a deposit of 300 yuan paid in one lump sum. If I want to continue living in this house, I must pay the rent according to this amount, otherwise, I will be forced to move out after one month. However, my finances have been tight since the war. If I increase the rent by two or three yuan, I can still afford it. Please advise: (1) Does A have the right under the law to force the tenant to move out and rent the house to someone else? (2) If I cannot find another house, can I continue to live there with a slight increase in rent or without an increase in rent? (3) If A uses harsh measures, what methods should I use to deal with him? (Yao Chengxiang)

(1) No. (2) Continuing to live there with an increased rent is a matter of mediation and agreement, not a legal issue. (3) Depending on the circumstances, you can appeal to the police station or the court according to the law. (Same)

Suppose A rented a shop from B (i.e., a sub-lessor) two years ago. No written contract was signed at the time, and A did not make any renovations. Now B wants to take back the shop to set up his own business. At the end of last year, he verbally notified A that he must move out of the house by the end of March of this year. A also agreed. When the date arrived, A suddenly used some excuse to refuse to move out. Now, there are the following questions. Please advise: (1) If there is no contract, A does not owe rent, can B take back the shop for his own use? (2) Three months ago, B verbally notified A of a deadline to move out. Can A refuse because he cannot move? (3) If A refuses to move out, can B notify A by registered letter, allowing him one or two months of grace? When the date arrives, if A still refuses to move out, can B apply to the court to order him to move out? (Xia Shigen)

(1) In this kind of indefinite lease relationship, if it can be proven that it is indeed being taken back for one's own use (and there is no intention to increase the rent, using taking it back for one's own use as an excuse), one can claim to terminate the contract. (2) Although notice was given three months ago and the tenant agreed, if it is difficult to move, the tenant can still claim a grace period for moving out according to Article 318, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code. (3) B can originally notify A by registered letter, giving him a reasonable period to move out. If he still does not move out, B can sue the court to order him to move out. However, whether there is a reason still needs to be referred to the above two points for explanation. (Ye Hui)

One year after January 28th, A rented a whole building from B (the sub-lessor). Three years later, B returned to his hometown and wanted to transfer the house to A. A did not want to rent it, so B transferred it to C. At that time, A wanted to move, but C tried hard to keep him and reduced A's rent by one yuan. For the sake of face, A did not move. Since the "August 13th" Shanghai war, the number of residents has suddenly increased. C wanted to take advantage of the opportunity to make a profit and urged A to move, but failed. Then he increased the rent by three yuan. For the previous five months, C added another yuan to A under the guise of rising electricity prices. Recently, the head landlord sent a letter instructing the sub-lessor to increase the rent by 10% across the board. C took the opportunity to ask A to increase the rent by ten yuan. A is now unemployed at home and his finances are weak. He only agreed to increase the rent by 10% according to the head landlord's example. C then told A to move out.

Now respectfully ask:

(1) Can A negotiate with C?

(2) If he sues the court, can A win against C?

(3) Because A cannot rent a house, can he not move?

(4) What is the approximate cost of litigation? Which party is responsible for it? (Lu Hanqiu)

(1) Since A is subletting the house from C and there is a lease relationship, he should negotiate. (2) The outcome of suing the court depends on the evidence and cannot be predicted. (3) A's inability to rent a house is a matter of fact and cannot be used as a reason for defense. (4) The cost of litigation is based on the total amount of two periods of rent. (Yi)

Can the rent be paid with British currency?

Please refer to the Legal Queries column in the second issue of this publication on May 8th of this year.

In the 12th year of the Republic of China, A borrowed five hundred yuan in foreign currency from B and issued a promissory note. B has not repaid it for more than ten years. B hired a lawyer to demand payment, but to no avail. Now A is quite well-off. B plans to sue A. Does this conflict with the 15-year statute of limitations for debt? (Chen Feipeng)

If it cannot be proven that A acknowledged the debt due to the demand, the statute of limitations has now expired. (Yong)

Brief Remarks

### Father's Disadvantage

— (Useless)

It seems strange that people in primitive times only knew about mothers and not fathers. But in today's law, parents are also very different. Children take their father's surname. If they take their mother's surname, the father must be a live-in son-in-law or the parents must have agreed otherwise. The father must ask the mother, who has gone through marriage or later marriage. If the father did not marry the mother, then he must be recognized by the father or raised. If the father wants to recognize the child, the child or its birth mother can also deny it, so there are many twists and turns to being a father. As for the mother's relationship with her children, she doesn't need so many procedures. So, there can be people without fathers, but there are no people without mothers. In other words, when a mother gives birth to a child, it is always her child. When a father gives birth to a child, it may not be his child. This is an example of gender inequality. How much fathers lose out, how wronged they are!

### Graduation Exhibition of the Western Painting Department of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts

— Yu Fu

Requesting Evaluation of Three Years of Achievements
Using a Modest Skill to Help Compatriots in Distress

Artists stranded on the isolated island seem to be unconcerned about the important task of saving the country. However, it cannot be denied that in recent months, exhibitions with the premise of disaster relief have been constantly held. This is the reality of the art world saving the country.

We still remember that in January of this year, the teachers and students of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts held a disaster relief art exhibition, and as a result, nearly 2,000 yuan was raised from the sale of tickets, all of which was donated to the orphanage for the construction of school buildings.

The Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts is the earliest art school established in the country, with a long history and a large number of talented people. Therefore, the graduation memorial exhibition held by the new 24th graduating class of the Western Painting Department this semester is worth paying attention to.

Their exhibition is jointly hosted by nine graduating students, and it has two meanings:

First, these nine graduates entered the Academy of Fine Arts, and three years have passed in a hurry. In these three years, they have been studying hard day and night. Have they reached the expected level? And how should they plan for further studies in the future? These many questions are confusing in the minds of each student. Therefore, they put out a few oil painting exercises and asked the art world's advanced artists, teachers, relatives, and friends to evaluate them as a reference.

Second, since the War of Resistance, mourning has spread everywhere. Even in Shanghai, compatriots in distress number in the thousands. In an environment where they cannot directly participate in the work of saving the country, they have to use this modest skill of painting to help compatriots in distress, to fulfill their original aspirations, and to fulfill their national duties.

Art is an organic whole and should have the function of metabolism. After several years of research, they have been trying their best to carry out the activities of generating new cells and eliminating old cells, and establishing new art. Therefore, the number of exhibits is only about a hundred, and the themes are only landscapes, still lifes, and figures. The small ones are only a foot long, and the large ones are less than a zhang square. However, in terms of style, there is absolutely no decadent mood of the academic school, vulgar and flashy feelings, and each work is indeed full of the strong and clear spirit of modern art, novel interest, unique personality, and the revelation of youthful vitality.

In order to enrich the content of the exhibition and increase the interest in buying tickets, President Liu Haisu, Western painting professors Guan Liang, Chen Shiwen, and Ru Jia generously donated several masterpieces of oil paintings to be included in the exhibition, giving ticket buyers the opportunity to draw lots.

They also plan to sketch portraits for guests at the venue. Graduating students will sketch at the same time in 20 minutes, and the person being sketched can choose one, which is a very interesting thing.

Now, I hope that people from all walks of life will do their best to guide them and support them. This will not only encourage these young people to pursue new art, but also help thousands of compatriots in distress.

(Note: The exhibition will be held from July 4th to 6th in the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Great World Department Store.)

### Female Storytellers

— Shen You

Biographies of Female Storytellers (II)

"During the Jiaqing period, Zhu Suxian, a woman from Yunjian, often summoned Xiang Jin, a woman from Taicang, to sing and tell stories of various families. … Later, she composed her own 'Jade Lotus Ring' and taught Xiang to sing it. During the Daoguang period, someone wrote the 'Tobacco Case Record' legend, which recorded that there was a female storyteller named Yang Yuzhen who was good at singing the 'Jade Dragonfly' story. Later, she had an affair with a scholar surnamed Zhang, and they used a tobacco case to pledge their love, which led to litigation and exile. The matters are mostly factual, and many Qing people's notes record the events, which are factual. It is also said that she had both beauty and talent, and was the most famous female storyteller at the time."

It can be seen that until the Daoguang period, female storytellers were still independent individuals who sang and told stories everywhere, without a fixed place. By the Xianfeng period, Shanghai became increasingly prosperous, and they gradually gained importance. According to the "Qing Bai Lei Chao," there was at that time "a famous woman named Lu Xiuqing, who was from Wu. She came to Shanghai to escape the war. Her appearance was exquisite, and her art was superb. People competed to invite her. One song was worth eight gold coins. She came slowly and left quickly, and her name was highly regarded for a time." As for fixed storytelling venues, they began around what Wang Tao called "Tudi Temple in the City." It was not until the Tongzhi period that there were "book apartments." Wang Tao's "Song Bin Suo Hua" (1893), Volume 12, "Bamboo Branch Words on Shanghai Storytelling Venues," explained the figures in the early days of book apartments:

The creation of book apartments in Shanghai began with Zhu Sulan. After a long time, this trend became very popular. It was most prosperous in the early years of Tongzhi. Sulan was about fifty years old and changed her surname to Shen. She still occasionally performed at banquets. The successor to Sulan was Zhou Ruixian, Yan Lizhen. Ruixian became famous for telling the "Romance of Three Smiles," but she could only tell half of it. Lizhen could perform the whole thing. Unfortunately, the orchid was destroyed and the jade broken, and she went to the underworld too soon.

Bamboo Branch Word No. 2 says: "The Romance of Three Smiles lets Ruixian perform, among them Lizhen is more virtuous. Now only Mother Zhou remains, still infatuated with the beautiful women's money." No. 3 says: "Sulan was the old-timer who opened the venue, and the skirt and hat startled everyone for a while. I am embarrassed to talk about leaving the bald story in the wine and flower venue. It is not easy to find ordinary joy." These are all poems for the above three people. These three people were not recorded in the "Ying Ruan Za Zhi." Sulan's deeds are no longer traceable, only a few poems were published in the "Shen Bao" at the time, which can be roughly imagined. Xiang Fu Hong Ao Guoke's "Praise to Zhu Sulan, the Storyteller":

She doesn't wear makeup, she loves light makeup, and she smells fragrant like musk orchids in the wind. The flower farmer listens to fairy music on moonlit nights, and who in the audience doesn't have a broken heart.

Her lifelong skill is the dulcimer, and her ice-like intelligence proves her true heart. She is the best at storytelling, and her singing voice is lingering and childish.

The original poem has eight verses. Only this one is worth referring to. There is also Bai Xia Qingxi Sheng, who wrote "Five Storytellers' Poems," and the second poem is about Zhu Sulan: "How can she be willing to be gentle and swaying like a willow, washing away the makeup and having a special fragrance. It is best for clay figures to listen without getting tired, and the pearl throat and silver armor are the best in storytelling." Wu Xing Renqiu Jushi commented on Sulan as "not painting her eyebrows long." These are all enough to see Zhu Zilan. However, it is inevitable that there were people with the same name at the time, and Wang Tao also recorded that she was "about fifty years old." I don't know if it is the same person. However, since there is no way to disprove it, I can only vaguely preserve it. This is the first female storyteller who started the book apartment.

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 13: Encouraging Learning, Agriculture, Storing Talent for the Country, Leaving the Strong, Eliminating the Weak, Selecting Seeds with Fields

At that time, Zhu Airen drove to the Provincial No. 13 Silkworm Seed Manufacturing Farm. The place was quiet, at the foot of a mountain, surrounded by a clear stream. The mountain was called Lu Mountain, and there was a large bamboo forest on it, with an ancient temple hidden in the middle. There was a monk inside, with a follower, who was practicing quietly there. The ancient temple only had a few rooms. Now, although it belonged to the Free Village, the villagers let him be free. At the foot of the mountain, many places were covered with mulberry fields, and the seed manufacturing farm was there. A horizontal road was built from the highway, directly to the seed manufacturing farm. It was built by the seed manufacturing farm, and it was very clean. When they went in, it happened that the director of the farm was at home today. It turned out that the director's surname was Ge, and he was also a silkworm expert. He was also over fifty years old. Director Ge was very happy to see Village Chief Zhu leading several ladies to visit. Besides Village Chief Zhu, Ai Qun also knew him, but Ai Ren had heard of him for a long time, and only met him today. As for the two Miss He, he only knew after Village Chief Zhu introduced them. When he saw Village Chief Mi, he said, "I was originally going to visit the village chief to report some things and to discuss something with the village chief, and ask you, old sir, to help. It's a coincidence that you, old sir, have come, which is even better." Village Chief Zhu asked, "What is it?" Director Ge smiled and said, "I'll slowly tell the village chief in a moment. Aren't these ladies here to visit our farm? It's not the silkworm rearing season now, so there's nothing to see. I can lead them around and take a look." At that time, Director Ge led them around. They first went to the large silkworm rearing room. There were five large silkworm rearing rooms in the whole farm. These houses were all bungalows, specially for silkworm rearing. There were ventilation windows on the top, and wooden floors on the bottom. There were iron screen windows on all sides, so that even the smallest flies and maggots could not get in. The rooms were also equipped with hot steam pipes, because silkworms are also a delicate animal and cannot stand the cold. If the weather suddenly gets cold when they are developing, they will not be able to stand it. At that time, the room must be warm like spring, and radiators must be turned on. Generally, the silkworm room has a certain temperature. Recently, there are thermometers specially for silkworm rooms, which are hung there. When raising silkworms, there is generally a suitable climate, but in addition to spring silkworms, there are also summer silkworms and autumn silkworms, which require certain temperatures, which is more complicated. But these are matters for their experts, and I won't bother you with the details. Someone joked that "in the Han Dynasty in China, there was a person who understood the temperature inside best, that was Sima Qian, the Grand Historian who wrote the Records of the Grand Historian, because he had been to the silkworm room, hadn't he?" This really made people laugh. (151)

### Youth Association Hosts Summer Social for Young People

— (Yu Xiangzhi)

Summer has arrived, and schools are successively starting summer vacation. These eager students will naturally need places and ways to spend their long vacation. However, the "isolated island" is now developing abnormally. If young people are not careful, they will be forced by boredom to frequent singing and dancing halls and many other inappropriate entertainment venues, living a "summer spring" life. Therefore, the youth department of the Shanghai YMCA is holding a summer social to promote group life during the summer vacation, to develop the physical and mental health of young people, and to cultivate the spirit of the four areas of education (moral, intellectual, physical, and social). The time is from July 1st to the end of August, from noon to 6:00 PM every day. This event provides the general public with a proper way to spend the summer in the depressing "isolated island" summer, which not only benefits individuals, but also benefits society at large. However, because the organizers are from the youth department, the target audience is mainly young people, and young people aged 10 to 16, regardless of gender, can register to participate. Judging from the age, they are probably male and female students in higher elementary and junior high school. Allowing them to avoid those improper amusements, this achievement may even surpass education.

The association has many regulations and entertainment methods: for example, in the games section there is: table tennis, chess, ball games, and other games; in the knowledge section there are: various daily newspapers and magazines; in the social section there are: social gatherings, group games; Chinese and Western singing, chorus; there are also two parts to the lectures, namely science and common sense. The scientific lectures are about engines, radio, airplanes, and poison gas. The common sense lectures are about hygiene, diet, gender, choosing friends, group life, etc.

In addition, there are two types of visits and competitions. The association will contact major factories, institutions, or gardens, etc., and lead participants to visit. The competitions are friendly matches between the games and singing practiced by the participants and groups from outside the association, and there are prizes for the winners.

Furthermore, the association's purpose is to serve young people, and there is no charge for participation. However, the quota is only 500 people, and only those who are quick will get in first.

### Dream Lover

— Ru Hua

"The Shonwarn Angel"

During World War I in 1914, the United States was the last to join the Allied forces to declare war on Germany. Now the world situation has reached the eve of the outbreak of the 1914 war again, and all parties are paying close attention to the attitude of the United States in particular. Although "Dream Lover" is a light-hearted romantic comedy, we can at least see a glimpse of the American attitude from the special preferential treatment and encouragement that the American public gives to soldiers joining the anti-aggression front. After watching this "Dream Lover" full of humor, we cannot ignore the director's efforts in this regard. For example, when Bill was knocked down by Dixie's car, the police saw that Bill was a soldier on his way to war and immediately ordered Dixie's car to take him to his regiment. A soldier who goes to the front line to fight for world peace should be given special respect by the public. Although Dixie had already agreed to marry Sam, she did not want to wound Bill's heart on the eve of his departure, nor did she want to give him the most powerful encouragement. She gained Sam's understanding and married Bill. When dealing with this scene, the director tried to avoid creating the opposite effect in Dixie's painful predicament and Sam's understanding, as if she was only deceiving this honest and kind person to leave New York immediately. And when the news of Bill's death in battle arrived, it was exactly when Dixie was performing in a nightclub, and the repeated singing replaced the desolate atmosphere at the time, which was also a sign of the glory of the dead and the coming of light.

The director also did not allow the progress of the whole play to slacken because it was full of laughter. For example, Bill was in Dixie's room twice, and Bill and Dixie went out together twice. Even Sam's smoking of cigarettes before and after became a strong contrast, and the emotions were very strong.

The scene after Dixie and Bill get married is difficult to handle, because it is already a redundant tail, but this exceeded all the climaxes, and the director achieved excellent results.

James Stewart's Bill, with his honest and innocent behavior, is as successful as the lawyer's assistant in "The Awful Truth". Margaret Sullavan is better at tragedy than comedy.
