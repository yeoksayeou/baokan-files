Editorial

### Chamberlain's Roar

The current European situation seems like a mystery: are the aggressor nations calculating that they can simply continue their advances without encountering resistance? Are the smaller nations destined to suffer the fate of being carved up? Has the democratic front truly reached its demise? Is a collective security system permanently impossible to establish? This puzzling situation has been shattered by Chamberlain's "March 31st Roar".

After Hitler's annexation of Czechoslovakia, his eastward policy continued unabated. He stepped into Lithuania with his left foot, easily seizing Memel, and touched Romania with his right foot, forcing them to sign some sort of economic treaty, thus geographically straddling Poland. Consequently, rumors spread around the world that Germany had made three demands of Poland: First, Poland was to return certain territories to Germany; second, Germany was to be allowed to build highways through the Polish Corridor; and third, the administrative organization of Danzig was to be changed as a prelude to Germany's annexation of the city. Although neither Poland nor Germany formally acknowledged this news at first, the fact that Germany had massed troops on the Polish border was undeniable. Poland was also preparing to mobilize a million troops to resist the aggressor. At the same time, London was in frequent contact with various countries, and Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck planned to visit Britain in early April to discuss the issue of collective security in Eastern Europe, indicating that the actual situation had reached a considerably serious stage. If Poland were to succumb this time, it would not only sacrifice its own glorious history of nation-building, becoming a "second Czechoslovakia" and a vassal of Germany, but it would also allow Germany to become fully developed and complacent. If Germany were to advance further, whether eastward towards the Soviet Union or westward towards France, there would be no force in the world capable of curbing its ferocious flames. This is truly a critical moment! When China reached the point of no tolerance towards Japan the year before last, it had no choice but to risk significant sacrifices and seek a path to survival through resistance. The Polish issue can be said to be the last straw for European democratic nations. Will the democratic nations not learn from China's spirit of resistance, and instead, watch as ferocious beasts devour people, ultimately leading themselves to ruin, only to regret it too late? Moreover, Hitler's aggressive attitude has been intensifying day by day. Rumors circulated at the end of March that he had issued an ultimatum to Poland, prompting the experienced and cautious Chamberlain to feel that any delay would carry the "grave danger of failing to decide to resist aggression." Therefore, without waiting for the arrival of Warsaw dignitary Colonel Beck in London on April 3rd, he announced aid to Poland, launching an effective blow to the aggressor nation.

Circumstances forced Chamberlain to quickly decide on his response strategy. He convened a cabinet meeting on the morning of March 31st, approved the contents of the declaration, and delivered a speech to Parliament in the afternoon, disseminating it to the world. Simultaneously, circumstances made it clear to Chamberlain that he had to abandon his policy of compromise and adopt a firm and forceful stance. He declared that if Poland were to be invaded by another country, Britain would provide full assistance, with Germany being the obvious target. However, Chamberlain's declaration also had a richer significance, indicating that the European collective security system had new hope for rebirth. He stated that the new policy was the result of mutual consultations among the British cabinet and the governments of Britain, France, Poland, and Romania, and that its effect was not only to aid Poland but also to apply equally to Romania. He also affirmed that France was in complete agreement with Britain and that the French government had authorized him to announce this together. He further stated that Britain and the Soviet Union were in complete agreement, with no disagreement in thought. Finally, he added that all of this was merely a transitional measure before the completion of the exchange of views among all relevant countries (including the Soviet Union) and that further concrete combinations would follow, and if there were no other avenues, an international conference would be convened.

Britain and France are the two pillars of the European democratic front. However, Chamberlain, traditionally conservative, and Daladier of France, both defied the demands of their own citizens and indulged in complacent illusions, allowing aggressors to act unscrupulously at any time. This time, Britain and France have both changed their attitudes, and on the same few days, Chamberlain announced an increase in the number of defense volunteers to 340,000 in preparation for overseas contingencies. Daladier also delivered a speech regarding relations with Italy, declaring that he would never cede an inch of territory or abandon any rights. This change in policy indicates that, on the one hand, the possibility of establishing a unified front within democratic countries has emerged, and on the other hand, the opportunity for re-connecting among the countries of the democratic front has matured. Therefore, Chamberlain's March 31st Roar is less about the situation in Poland or Eastern Europe and more about its epoch-making significance in world history.

Poland has already responded to Chamberlain's declaration with satisfaction, and Colonel Beck is on his way to Britain. It is certain that concrete measures of cooperation between Britain and Poland will be discussed soon. Romania's acceptance of assistance is also undoubtedly clear. Hitler is accustomed to making empty threats, and this time, with Poland not showing weakness, supported by Britain and France, and with Italy not enthusiastically supporting Germany's invasion of Poland, Hitler's last-minute retreat can be said to be within expectations. However, Hitler also possesses a talent for calmly observing the situation and adapting. If the democratic front were to relax even slightly, he would use clever divisive tactics to defeat democratic countries one by one while simultaneously implementing his endless new policies of aggression. Therefore, the question after Chamberlain's declaration is how to establish a permanent collective security organization – especially one that does not forget the participation of the Soviet Union and the United States – otherwise, Europe will continue to enjoy only momentary peace. While we admire Mr. Chamberlain's great spirit, we must also make further expectations of him, hoping that he will lead the re-connection of the democratic front and complete the collective security system of Europe.

### Japan's Occupation of the New Southern Islands; France Prepares to Lodge a Protest; Japan Expands Its Influence in Southern China; Britain and the United States Attach Great Importance; Japan Plans to Restore Navigation Between Haikou and Haiphong

According to official sources last night, following Japan's announcement of the annexation of French islands, the cabinet will convene a meeting today to discuss the appropriate actions France should take regarding Japan's occupation of the Spratly Islands (i.e., the French New Southern Islands, located 700 miles south of Hainan Island). Although the nature of France's retaliation against Japan has not been disclosed, it is widely believed that prior action can demonstrate the government's determination. French officials firmly maintain that the French navy occupied the islands in 1930 and 1933. Unexpectedly, while negotiations were underway regarding the status of the islands, the Japanese suddenly announced the annexation of the islands. (1st Day Associated Press Dispatch)

(Paris) Well-informed sources here have recently stated that after Japan's annexation of the New Southern Islands, the French government will likely lodge a protest with that country. (1st Day Havas Dispatch)

(Paris) The cabinet held a State Council meeting today to discuss the issue of Japan's decision to annex the New Southern Islands. Afterwards, according to responsible sources, the French government will immediately lodge a protest with Japan. The dispute between France and Japan over the sovereignty of the New Southern Islands has not been recent. Japan has refused to recognize France's annexation of the islands. Subsequently, the French government proposed submitting the dispute to arbitration, which was also rejected by Japan. (1st Day Havas Dispatch)

(Paris) Well-informed sources stated that France insists on its sovereignty over the islands and emphasizes that the islands are an airbase for attacking Vietnam and Singapore. (1st Day Haitian Dispatch)

(Paris) Japan's straightforward action of unilaterally claiming the right to govern the New Southern Islands is considered here to be at least surprising. France insists that the islands have been French territory since they were effectively occupied by the French, and that the occupation was notified to various countries. France's ownership has recently been challenged by Japan, and in the middle of negotiations, today's announcement is felt here to be arrogant. At the same time, there is no issue of these islands causing a war. The fate of the islands will ultimately be decided by a peaceful treaty. (31st Day Reuters Dispatch)

(London) A Foreign Office spokesperson stated last night that the government has not yet received confirmed reports regarding the Japanese occupation of the Spratly Islands. These islands were previously under British protection and were incorporated into French territory in 1933. (1st Day Associated Press Dispatch)

(Washington) The Japanese annexation of the New Southern Islands is being closely studied by the State Department. Secretary of State Hull stated to the press that the State Department has not yet received formal notification regarding this matter. (1st Day Havas Dispatch)

(New York) The New York Times published an editorial commenting on Japan's annexation of the New Southern Islands, titled "Japan's Old Habits Return," stating, in part, that the islands have been incorporated into French territory, "[Japan] is taking advantage of the fact that the democratic countries of Europe are focusing all their efforts on issues vital to their survival, and has seized the New Southern Islands, which are of extreme importance to these countries. Months ago, it already seized Hainan Island in China, and now it has raised its flag on islands 700 miles south of that island. This is Japan's usual trick." (1st Day Havas Dispatch)

(Tokyo) Osaka Shosen Kaisha has decided to resume scheduled navigation services between Haikou on Hainan Island and Haiphong in French Vietnam. The company had been engaged in this business for 18 years before 1932. Now that Hainan Island is under Japanese control, it has decided to resume the service. The company's ships sailing to Bangkok will serve Haikou and Haiphong both ways. The Bang Kok Maru (5450 tons) will be the first to resume this service, scheduled to set sail from Yokohama on April 6th and is expected to arrive in Haikou on April 21st. (1st Day Reuters Dispatch)

### Tense Relations Between Japan and the Soviet Union; London Rumors of Japan Dispatching Warships to Vladivostok; Tokyo Spreads Rumors of Mongolian Troops Crossing the Manchurian Border

Manchester: British Member of Parliament and renowned author Norman Angell stated in a speech here yesterday that Japan has dispatched a large number of warships to the area of Vladivostok in the Soviet Union.

Germany in the West, without any concerns, will inevitably take action to engulf Poland. (1st Day Associated Press Dispatch)

(Tokyo) According to news received here from Changchun, Mongolian troops, traveling in armored vehicles and ten trucks, crossed the border near Alagabu Erga between March 18th and 20th, entering the territory of "Manchukuo."

The 35,000-ton battleship "Tirpitz" is scheduled to be launched at 4:45 pm. The bottle will be broken by Miss Lang, granddaughter of Admiral Tirpitz, the late Navy Minister during the European War, and former ambassador to Italy, Mrs. Hassel. Then, Chancellor Hitler will deliver a speech. (A Havas dispatch from one day)

Wilhelmshaven: Today, tens of thousands of people from all over Germany arrived here in 50 special trains and hundreds of trucks to attend the launching ceremony of the 35,000-ton battleship "Tirpitz" and listen to Hitler's speech. It is reported that in his speech, Hitler will respond to the remarks made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons yesterday. The public here is in high spirits. Naval soldiers marched in formation, led by a band, through the crowded streets. All dockyards, shops, and residences are enthusiastically preparing to welcome them. It is expected that in addition to the warships already moored here, more naval vessels will continue to arrive. The tonnage of the third battleship planned by the German Navy is still unknown. However, according to hints from some responsible parties, this new ship may be 45,000 tons and will be named "Frederick the Great." The "Tirpitz" is 897 feet long, 118 feet wide, and has a draft of 26 feet. The ship will be equipped with eight 15-inch guns, twelve 6-inch guns, and high-angle guns of equal power. (A Reuter dispatch from one day)

Wilhelmshaven: Hitler watched the launching of the second 35,000-ton battleship "Tirpitz" today with a very solemn and tense attitude. (A Reuter dispatch from one day)

Wilhelmshaven: The launching ceremony of the second German 35,000-ton battleship "Tirpitz" was held in Wilhelmshaven today. Chancellor Hitler, Admiral Raeder, commander-in-chief of the Navy, General Brauchitsch, commander-in-chief of the Army, and many other important figures from the Party, government, and military attended the ceremony. Mrs. Hassel presided over the naming ceremony. Mrs. Hassel comes from a distinguished family, her father was a naval admiral, and her husband was the German ambassador to Italy. Before the ceremony, Tirpitz made the greatest contribution, dedicating his life to building the German Navy, which is worthy of admiration. In addition, Hitler personally inspected the military port currently under construction after the ceremony and then boarded the "Scharnhorst" warship. (A Huitong dispatch from one day)

(Berlin) It is expected that Hitler will deliver a speech in Wilhelmshaven between 5:45 PM and 6:00 PM today (Shanghai time is between 0:45 AM and 1:00 AM tomorrow). (A Reuter dispatch from one day)

(Berlin) It is widely believed that Hitler is very resentful of Britain's handling of the Polish situation and Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration today that Britain will come to Poland's aid if it is attacked. Well-informed sources say that Hitler will vehemently criticize them in his speech in Wilhelmshaven tomorrow. The Foreign Ministry lounge and the Chancellery were very busy tonight, with many people coming and going. It is now believed that Hitler has summoned his secretary to completely rewrite the section of his speech concerning foreign politics. It is said that he consulted with Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Information Director Dietrich. The official attitude tonight is very cautious. The Propaganda Ministry discussed the distribution of Chamberlain's declaration to the newspapers for a long time. The first newspaper to carry this declaration was not seen by readers until 10:00 PM. (A Reuter dispatch from March 31st)

(Berlin) Today is the day for the launching ceremony of Germany's second battleship, the "Wilhelmshaven." It is expected that German Chancellor Hitler will take this opportunity to respond to British Prime Minister Chamberlain with strong rhetoric. It is widely believed that Hitler is prepared to respond to the general foreign criticism of Germany's military aggression. Chamberlain's announcement that Britain and France guarantee the integrity of Polish territory will only intensify the severity of Hitler's speech. Diplomatic circles expect that the Chancellor's speech will be the most important since the Czech crisis last September. National Socialist officials are very angry that Chamberlain expressed support for Poland before Germany had any chance to annex Danzig and the Polish border. Diplomatic circles have not made any presumptions about the consequences of the British government's actions, but well-informed sources believe that Hitler may be extremely angry and unwilling to make any sacrifices, acting immediately. An official news agency of the National Socialist Party called Britain's expression to Poland "ridiculous." This kind of blueprint makes Europe completely untrustworthy and creates a state of instability. Germany's construction in Central Europe will never be hindered by this kind of Platonic declaration. (An Associated Press dispatch from one day)

### Poland Resolves to Rely on Self-Reliance: To Maintain National Independence; Expresses Gratitude for Guarantees Offered by Britain; Beck to Visit London to Review Three Matters

Warsaw: After British Prime Minister Chamberlain issued a declaration in the House of Commons today, responsible officials here expressed great satisfaction, saying that Britain's acceptance of commitments to Central Europe recognizes that peace in Eastern Europe is as important as peace in Western Europe. This is the first time. If conflict arises between Germany and Poland in the future due to the Free City of Danzig issue, it will be difficult to localize the scope. The guarantee that Britain provides to our country is of a general nature, so it will automatically apply to conflicts caused by the Danzig issue, without any doubt. As for our country's current foreign policy, there has been no change. It will still be based on the following principles to the extent permitted: (1) Resolutely implement an independent policy, with all actions decided solely by the national government, relying entirely on national strength. (2) Maintain good relations with all neighboring countries without discrimination. (3) Be willing to resolve all disputes with neighboring countries in a friendly spirit. (4) All existing alliance treaties and the friendships that our country maintains with other countries must be maintained. (A Havas dispatch from March 31st)

Warsaw: The Warsaw authorities have unanimously expressed satisfaction with Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement. The general opinion is that the British government has now abandoned its past reservations about active cooperation and decided to implement a policy of European unity. Chamberlain said, "The British government now deeply understands that to promote appeasement, Western Europe and Eastern Europe must work together. From the experience of the Locarno Pact, it is clear that to consolidate peace, all of Europe must take unified action. Poland's attitude has become the key to deciding success or failure. This depends on Poland doing its best to maintain its independent policy." Authoritative sources here said, "Poland's policy is based on the principle of independence and self-reliance. Poland will do its best to foster good relations and abide by treaty obligations. Chamberlain's declaration has clearly stated that Poland's position has now become the decisive factor in Eastern European peace, and we must work hard to achieve this." (A Huitong dispatch from one day)

(London) Huitong News Agency learned from well-informed Polish sources last night that the rumors that Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck would travel to England today for a visit, accompanied by many military experts, are not true. Beck is only accompanied by Sir Potocki, Director of the Western European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and a few secretaries. Polish sources here believe that it is still difficult to say whether Beck will visit Paris after his visit to England. However, the French government has indeed invited Beck. Poland is extremely satisfied with Britain's declaration of support for Poland. Whether this declaration can lead to the conclusion of a British-Polish treaty, or even a British-French-Polish tripartite agreement, will depend on the outcome of Beck's negotiations with British politicians. (A Huitong dispatch from one day)

Warsaw: British Prime Minister Chamberlain issued a statement in the House of Commons yesterday, saying that he was willing to guarantee Poland's independence and would not hesitate to resort to force. Public opinion here expressed great satisfaction. The significance of Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's visit to England in the coming days is therefore even greater. Political figures said that Foreign Minister Beck's trip will review three matters with the British government: (1) What is the attitude of various countries towards the Soviet Union, and what will be the Soviet Union's position in the event of a European war? (2) What is the British government's attitude towards Poland's second ally, namely Romania (France is Poland's first ally)? (3) What will be the future relationship between Poland and its northern and southern neighbors? In addition to these three points, Poland intends to request colonies in order to absorb surplus population, and the two issues of obtaining raw materials and relocating Polish Jews abroad will also be discussed. In addition, British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson visited Warsaw earlier and held talks on bilateral trade relations and the issue of Britain providing credit loans to Poland. With Foreign Minister Beck's arrival in England, he will continue to exchange views. Foreign Minister Beck also intends to visit Portsmouth Naval Base one day before his scheduled departure from England. This is highly valued by diplomatic circles here. It is rumored that Britain intends to allocate some of its warships that have reached the end of their service life for use by Poland. (A Havas dispatch from one day)

### Frequent Troop Movements by German Army Along Polish Border: Seeking to Force Poland to Remain Neutral to Avoid Worries in the Rear; Seems to Still Have Reservations About Using Force

(Paris) Diplomatic figures here recently declared that since Germany occupied the Bohemian and Moravian provinces of the Czech Republic, peace-loving countries have proposed forming a group to confront Germany. Recently, Germany has added threats to Poland, and this proposal has become even more forceful. Germany's goals are nothing more than two: one is to gain benefits from Polish territory, and the other is to force Poland to strictly maintain neutrality, so that Germany can calmly develop in other directions without worries in the rear. Since Germany annexed the Czech Republic and recovered the Memel region, it has surrounded Poland. Poland was already feeling uneasy. In addition, when Poland recently conducted diplomatic talks with Germany, it learned that Germany had a total of three demands: (1) A certain area of Poland should be returned to Germany. (2) Germany should be allowed to build a highway through the Polish Corridor. (3) A new temporary solution should be formulated for the Free City of Danzig as a preliminary step for Germany to annex it. Germany's desire to control Poland is now evident. However, Poland has also decided to resist. It has already expressed its refusal to the first and second demands, and only promised to carefully consider the third one. It is rumored that Germany has sent an ultimatum to Poland. Although the German and Polish governments have denied this, diplomatic figures here still say that German troops are on high alert near the Polish border, which is indeed the real situation. In view of this, the British government has decided to provide a new guarantee of security to Poland. Poland, in addition to declaring that it will maintain a joint relationship with Romania in the event of a German attack, does not accept any commitment from Britain to avoid Germany using it as an excuse. (A Havas dispatch from March 31st)

(Berlin) Experienced observers here recently commented on German policy, saying that while Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck is about to visit England, Germany's main intention is to put pressure on Poland, mocking the unreliability of aid from Britain and France. However, Germany may not necessarily have a conflict with Poland at this time, for two reasons: (1) Poland's resistance is quite strong. (2) Italy is very concerned about Poland, as can be seen from Foreign Minister Ciano's recent visit to Warsaw. If a conflict occurs between Germany and Poland under such circumstances, the Rome-Berlin Axis will inevitably be weakened. (3) If the dispute between Germany and Poland leads to war, it is feared that it will be even less reasonable to the public than a war caused by Italy's colonial demands. Based on this, it can be asserted that Chancellor Hitler should still use peaceful means to continue expanding labor eastward and make every effort to avoid armed conflict.

Athens: After arriving here, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels boarded a special plane today and flew to the Italian island of Rhodes in the Aegean Sea, intending to rest there for some time. (A Havas News Agency dispatch from one day)

### An Important Page in British Diplomatic History: Breaking with Traditional Isolation Policy; Resolutely Accepts Constraints and Guarantees Eastern European Security; Chamberlain's Declaration Gains Support from Domestic Public Opinion

(London) All the newspapers here warmly welcome Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement in the House of Commons today, considering it a new trend in British foreign policy. The Daily Telegraph states that this is the most significant watershed in the entire diplomatic history of Britain, and says that Britain's border is no longer the Rhine, but the Vistula River region. This announcement clearly indicates that Britain has now broken the last chain of its 19th-century isolation policy, and domestic public opinion warmly welcomes this change. The News Chronicle states that until today, it seems that the opportunity for power has shifted from totalitarian countries to democratic countries. The Times states that the Prime Minister's decisive remarks are a brave and realistic challenge to the diplomatic methods that have shocked the world in recent times. (A Reuter dispatch from March 31st)

(London) After British Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons that Britain would definitely provide assistance to Poland if it were invaded, diplomatic circles here believe that this is a dramatic change in British foreign policy. In peacetime, Britain has always been unwilling to get involved in Eastern Europe. This policy has always been seen as a way for France to encircle Germany, while Britain has always regarded it as not only not easy to guarantee peace, but also enough to induce war, so it has always avoided adopting it. Now that it has adopted this policy, it can be seen that it has made a great determination. According to a government spokesman, British military aid to Poland includes any event in Poland. In other words, any action in Danzig and the Polish Corridor will apply. Also, Chamberlain read the original draft to the US and Soviet ambassadors before making this statement. (An Associated Press dispatch from one day)

### Paris Newspapers: Unanimously Praise

(Paris) French newspapers this morning attached great significance to Chamberlain's declaration, considering it a turning point in British and French foreign policy. At the same time, it is the result of French Foreign Minister Bonnet's efforts. It is said that Bonnet recently visited London and consulted with British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax several times, resulting in persuading Britain to extend its border from the Rhine to Eastern Europe. Since Britain has issued a declaration guaranteeing to support Poland if it is invaded, France will inevitably adopt the same attitude, especially since France and Poland have an alliance relationship. As for the existing treaty between Poland and Romania, which originally stipulated mutual assistance if one of the signatory countries was attacked by Soviet Russia, it should be amended to provide for mutual assistance between Poland and Romania if they are attacked by Germany, plus the support of Britain and France. Therefore, as a result of the change in British and French diplomacy, Britain and France will declare a guarantee to Poland and Romania in some form, while Poland and Romania declare mutual assistance. According to "Le Journal," the progress of these negotiations has been notified to the Soviet Union at any time and has been greatly appreciated by the Soviet Union. (A Huitong dispatch from one day)

### Collective Security Organization: Will Surely Achieve Something

(Paris) French newspapers unanimously praised Britain's firm stance and Poland's determination to maintain its independence. Le Petit Parisien states that Britain's attitude is extremely important, and Romania will also obtain the same guaranteed security as Poland. The safety line is being organized and is expected to be completely successful. Le Figaro states that Poland was able to obtain a formal and correct guarantee from Britain because Poland itself proved its desire to maintain its independence and was prepared to defend it by force. (A Reuter dispatch from one day)

### Completely Different in Nature from the French-Polish Alliance

(Paris) Responsible figures in France have praised the declaration made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons today, saying that this is the first time that Britain has accepted a practical commitment to Eastern Europe. Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration is the most important event in history. The "balance of power" policy pursued by Britain and Poland has now been abandoned, and the proposal for a group of peace-loving countries to be formed can be implemented. One thing that must be noted is that the guarantee provided by Britain to Poland is different in nature from the commitments stipulated in the current alliance treaties between France and Poland. In other words, the commitments of France and Poland are mutual, while the guarantee assumed by Britain is unilateral. Although this is not welcomed by Germany, it cannot accuse Poland of not taking friendly actions towards that country. In short, Britain has initiated the issue of a collective security system in Eastern Europe. It will take a long time for talks to be conducted effectively. Britain is actively consulting with the Soviet Union and Romania. As far as Romania is concerned, since France signed a commercial agreement with it, it does not have to worry about resisting Germany's further economic pressure. In addition, a British economic delegation will also travel to the Romanian capital in the short term to negotiate a similar agreement with that country, which will naturally be more beneficial to that country's economy. In addition, Italy also maintains friendly relations with Poland and Romania. Its attitude towards general international issues may change after the establishment of a collective security system in Eastern Europe. (A Havas dispatch from March 31st)

### Key to European Peace and War: Lies in Germany's Attitude

(Paris) The declaration issued by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons yesterday has been commented on by various newspapers here, unanimously praising it as a "historical declaration," and saying that this decision should be regarded as the beginning of Britain's acceptance of commitments to countries east of the Rhine. Le Droit states, "For several weeks, the threat posed by totalitarian countries has intensified, and the crisis has become imminent. Britain has suddenly realized the close relationship between the interests of European countries, and has resolved to lead peace and guarantee the group in Europe and in Eastern Europe. This is gratifying." Le Petit Parisien states, "The diplomatic lineup of Britain and France has now been restored, and we are sincerely pleased to hear about it. We hope that the two countries will continue to be brave and move forward." L'Ordre states, "The key to European peace and war now lies in the hands of Chancellor Hitler. He has gained vast benefits and should stop at the right time." L'Ère Nouvelle states, "Although Chancellor Hitler is prepared to take large-scale military action against Poland, the recent international environment and diplomatic activities are no longer the same as before, and Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement yesterday is particularly noteworthy. Then, Chancellor Hitler can often think twice before acting?" L'Humanité states, "Britain and France have already shown their determination to defend in solidarity. Prime Minister Chamberlain has now issued such an important statement, which is tantamount to declaring that Britain, France, and Poland have concluded an alliance treaty to resist Hitler's possible violent actions. Tracing back to its origin, the US government is actually supporting it strongly." (A Havas News Agency dispatch from one day)

### Lithuania Feels Satisfied

Kaunas: The general public in Lithuania is satisfied with the remarks made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons this afternoon. It is widely believed here that these remarks are not only related to Poland's security, but also contain implications related to the general security of Eastern Europe. (A Reuter dispatch from March 31st)

### Berlin's Unusual Resentment: Believes Versailles Policies Are Being Re-enacted and Cannot Prevent German Construction in Central Europe

(Berlin) British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks did not surprise German political figures, as they had already received intelligence that the British government would change its policies. Before issuing the declaration, British newspapers first engaged in propaganda, claiming that Poland was in danger of being attacked. The British government then used this "fabricated foundation" as an excuse to guarantee Poland's security. In reality, this move by Britain is a re-enactment of the Versailles policies, seeking to turn Europe into two fortresses to fulfill Britain's ambition to rule Europe and the world. Britain now intends to make Poland a buffer state on the continent, a role previously played by Czechoslovakia, according to political figures. Germany has discovered many documents in the external archives of Czechoslovakia, revealing the British government's attempts to encourage the Czech government to implement anti-German policies even after the Munich Agreement. Chamberlain's declaration has now caused people here to pay great attention to the speech that Führer Hitler will deliver today in Wilhelmshaven. (A Huitong dispatch from the 1st)

(Berlin) A semi-official German news agency issued a message last night stating that British Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration, which stated that Britain would provide assistance if Poland were to be subjected to unwarranted aggression, was purely "British complacency." Chamberlain's sudden remarks on such a clear day are incomprehensible. In fact, the fact that Britain and France would provide assistance if Poland were to be subjected to armed attack has been a traditional policy of the two countries for many years. Therefore, Chamberlain's declaration is not a new argument. Its effect is only to spread rumors about Germany among small European countries. Moreover, in the past few months, small countries have become suspicious of Britain's lip service and lack of concrete action. Therefore, Chamberlain issued his declaration in order to strengthen the small countries' faith in Britain. However, Germany's strategy of building Central Europe will not be abruptly suspended due to Chamberlain's declaration. (A Huitong dispatch from the 1st)

(Berlin) Regarding British Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration in the House of Commons yesterday, stating that Britain would provide assistance if Poland were attacked, local newspapers stated that it could not be regarded as a peaceful solution to international disputes, and that the declaration inevitably contained misrepresentations of Germany's intentions. The "German General News" published Chamberlain's declaration in a prominent position and commented on it in the context of foreign policy, stating, "There was originally a possibility of conducting negotiations to peacefully resolve the dispute between Germany and Poland, but it failed to materialize due to Poland's ambiguous response. However, in reality, the relationship between Germany and Poland is not as dangerous as Chamberlain said. Chamberlain's guarantee of assistance to Poland is a new direction in British foreign policy, which we cannot yet fully believe. However, German people originally had a good impression of Chamberlain, but from now on, I am afraid it will change." The Nazi Party's organ, "People's Observer," stated, "The British Prime Minister's declaration may be due to a lack of understanding of the dangerous consequences of promoting an anti-German movement, and therefore made such a statement. We firmly believe that Chamberlain's aides have lobbied the Polish government to abandon its consistent prudence and entice it to join the anti-German camp, relying on this strategy to achieve their goals. This is a foolish move by British foreign policy." (A Huitong dispatch from the 1st)

### The United States Expresses Sympathy to Britain and France; Germany Should Be Held Responsible if a European War Breaks Out

Hot Springs, USA. People close to President Roosevelt recently made remarks, saying that today, all nations and continents are in danger of being controlled by Germany, and countries around the world are living in fear. Britain and France have therefore erected barriers to stem the crisis. As for Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement in the House of Commons today, its tone implies that if a war breaks out in Europe, Germany should be held responsible. According to informed sources, these remarks were indirectly made by President Roosevelt himself. (A Havas dispatch from the 30th)

(Washington) After people close to President Roosevelt made remarks in Hot Springs yesterday, informed sources here said that these remarks can be regarded as an indirect expression by President Roosevelt himself. Previously, on September 27th of last year, when the European situation was extremely tense, President Roosevelt telegraphed German leader Hitler, appealing for peace. The unspoken message has already revealed that if a war breaks out in Europe, who will be the instigator, the responsibility lies with whom, and there is no room for evasion. Now, if we compare this telegram with this resolution talk, we can mutually illuminate each other. The President's intention is nothing more than to instruct the public to take action as the international situation becomes increasingly serious. This method is supported by political figures, who say that the government's intention to distinguish between aggressor and victim countries in the Neutrality Act amendment can be seen from this move. (A Havas dispatch from the 1st)

(Washington) Although Secretary of State Hull refused to comment after British Prime Minister Chamberlain issued a statement the day before, willing to guarantee Poland's independence, political figures here have generally praised it. The anti-Hitler group that Britain and France intend to form almost failed last week. Now that the countries have taken a firm stand to resist Germany's expansion towards Poland, the authorities' economic assistance to the democratic countries will also be strengthened as a result. For example, it will be easier to amend the Neutrality Act. (A Havas dispatch from the 1st)

(New York) American newspapers have praised British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks yesterday. The "New York Herald Tribune" referred to this as a historically valuable declaration, elaborating on the necessary conditions for restoring the negotiating rights of democratic countries. Without these conditions, a solution is impossible. The "Washington Post" stated that this remark is the most effective change in Europe in a long time. (A Reuters dispatch from the 1st)

(Washington) British Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration to the House of Commons yesterday was recently commented on by American political figures. French Prime Minister Daladier delivered a broadcast speech a few days ago, expressing a firm attitude. The French House of Representatives also unanimously passed a motion expressing sympathy to the Czech nation. Now, Prime Minister Chamberlain has issued this important statement at this time, which can be regarded as decisive. Since last year, the British government's unilateral concessions to the totalitarian countries in order to stabilize European peace have come to an end. The attitude adopted by Britain and France is now fully supported by American public opinion. To curb the unlimited expansion of the totalitarian countries and maintain peace, it is best to deal with them with a firm and calm attitude. This has always been the view of the United States. It is gratifying that the governments of Britain and France have gradually approached the views of the United States in recent times. In short, the position taken by Prime Minister Chamberlain and Prime Minister Daladier is sufficient to prove that Britain and France are ready, both spiritually and materially, and are united. As a result, although the American isolationists once increased their momentum after March 15, they will inevitably tend to disappear in the future. (A Havas dispatch from the 1st)

### The Soviet Union Adopts a Reserved Attitude

(Moscow) After British Prime Minister Chamberlain issued a declaration the day before, stating that Britain and France would intervene to provide assistance as soon as Poland believes it is in crisis, Soviet government officials have generally adopted an extremely reserved attitude. Diplomatic figures also stated that whether Britain's attitude has truly changed depends on future facts. Because Prime Minister Chamberlain must wait for Poland to take the initiative before taking action, and at the same time, there is no guarantee that Poland intends to resist Germany. (A Havas dispatch from the 1st)

(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent claimed that all sectors of the Soviet Union have responded well to the British Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration today that Britain and France will protect and assist Poland. Before the Prime Minister's declaration was made in the House of Commons, Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Maisky, the US ambassador to Britain, at the Foreign Office and informed him of the content of the declaration. This kind of contact seems to alleviate the general feeling that the Soviet Union will be coldly placed "on the side" in this discussion of the European situation initiated by Britain. (A Reuters dispatch from the 31st)

### British Chargé d'Affaires Inquires About Italy's Position; Met with Ciano Twice Yesterday

(Rome) British Chargé d'Affaires Sir Charles Keilter met with Foreign Minister Ciano for the second time tonight. It is reported that he inquired about the border security issues of certain countries in Eastern Europe and Southeastern Europe. If Britain takes diplomatic action, what would Italy's position be? (A Havas dispatch from the 31st)

(Rome) After British Prime Minister Chamberlain issued a statement in the House of Commons today, offering guarantees to Poland, Italian official circles did not comment on it. Political figures were deeply impressed and said that this statement directly involved Germany and Poland. Italy, because it maintains deep friendship with each of these countries, is also extremely concerned. Certain figures also said that the small sense of security caused by Germany's annexation of Bohemia and Moravia has not yet dissipated, and now the Polish issue has been raised again, which is a mistake. (A Havas dispatch from the 31st)

(London) Diplomatic figures here recently claimed that Italy does not approve of Germany's oppression of Poland. This is no different from its disapproval of Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. Italian official circles still refer to the Berlin-Rome axis. It is true, but this axis has been severely affected by Germany's recent actions. When Germany annexed the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia in Czechoslovakia, it did not notify Italy in advance. Afterwards, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini did not congratulate Führer Hitler, nor did he recognize it. Italy's position can be regarded as the same as that of Britain, France, and the United States. Moreover, Italy maintains sincere friendship with Hungary, and also favors Poland, and recognizes this as an extension of its friendship with Hungary. At this time, it will definitely work hard to prevent Germany from invading Poland, and at the same time, it should prevent Poland from establishing a connection with Britain forever, which is a matter of course. If it is said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini intends to mediate between Germany and Poland, I am afraid it is unlikely, because Führer Hitler will definitely refuse it. In addition, British Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine is in Rome holding talks with the Italian authorities. Diplomatic figures here are closely monitoring it, believing that the various issues in the Mediterranean will be discussed with reference to the Polish and Hungarian issues, and that they will be submitted for discussion as exchange conditions. (A Havas dispatch from the 1st)

### The Spanish National Army Decides to Join the Anti-Comintern Pact; Italy and Germany Collude; This Move Is Purely Political

Madrid. Regarding the Spanish National Army's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, it is generally believed that it will become a reality sooner or later. A Huitong reporter recently learned from reliable sources in Madrid that the National Army government will formally announce its joining the Anti-Comintern Pact in the near future. (A Huitong dispatch from the 1st)

(Rome) All Italian newspapers today unanimously reported that the Spanish rebel government has joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, and that it is now allied with the aggressive totalitarian countries. According to non-official sources from Burgos, Spain signed the Anti-Comintern Pact a few days ago. The report also said, "In this way, Spain can be linked to Germany, Italy, and Japan to jointly resist Bolshevism." (A Huitong dispatch from the 1st)

(Paris) French reports here today stated that Spain's adherence to the Anti-Comintern Pact is purely political in nature and does not contain any military relationship. The French have confirmed the Rome reports that the Spanish rebels signed the Anti-Comintern Pact this week. (An AP dispatch from the 1st)

### Canada Will Definitely Help the Empire Fight; Neutrality Is Absolutely Impossible

Ottawa. Canadian Federal Minister of Justice Lapointe recently gave a speech in the House of Commons, saying that if the British Empire or the British mainland is threatened by war, the reaction of Canadian public opinion will be extremely激激. As a result, no matter which party is in power, the Canadian Federation will inevitably rise up to participate in the war. Conversely, if the Canadian government strictly implements neutrality and applies general neutrality measures to British merchant ships anchored in Canadian ports, prohibiting them from transporting military supplies, then civil war will inevitably occur within the Federation. (A Havas dispatch from the 1st)

### London's City Center: A Night of Terror; Multiple Bombings Occur

(London) Terrorist elements were active again yesterday and today. At midnight yesterday, a bombing occurred on the sidewalk in front of the "News Chronicle" newspaper on Fleet Street (the street where newspaper offices are concentrated). All the glass windows of the newspaper and the glass windows of the "Daily Telegraph" newspaper across the street were shattered. Fortunately, no one was injured. The police rushed to the scene and immediately began investigating. According to a witness, someone was seen running away a few seconds after the bomb exploded. Until 2:00 AM today, a bomb exploded in front of a fashion store on Park Street, completely destroying the storefront, but no one was injured. An hour later, explosions occurred in front of a woodwork shop on Tottenham Street and in front of a shoe store on Edgware Road, but no one was injured. Later, at around 5:00 AM, the police discovered another bomb in front of a fashion store on Edgware Road, but it did not explode. After 6:00 AM, a bomb exploded in front of a bank on Strand Street, causing some material damage. According to police investigations, all the bomb fragments recovered were of the same type, probably thrown by terrorist elements from a car, and they chose to do so when there were no pedestrians on the street, so they were able to escape calmly.

### Discussion on the Yellow River's Breaching at Huayuankou and Zhaokou and Ways to Defend Against Floods in Northern Jiangsu (Lan Zhu Jun from Dongtai)

1.  Introduction

As the saying goes, "The Yangtze, Huai, Yellow, and Ji are the four [rivers]." The [rivers] are unique, meaning that each has its own meridian line to flow smoothly without encroaching on each other and flowing independently into the sea. Since July of last year, the enemy troops breached the Yellow River in Henan Province, first at Huayuankou in Zhongmu and then at Zhaokou in Zheng County. As a result, the Yellow River overflowed, disrupting the usual network of waterways. It flowed into the Ying River via the Jialu River, and then joined the Huai River at Zhengyangguan in Anhui Province. It surged eastward, and the western embankment of the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu (including Gaoyou, Jiangdu, Taixian, Xinghua, Dongtai, Yancheng, Huaiyin, Funing, and other counties), which relies on it to protect life and property and defend against floods, opened the Xinba and Liangba dams on August 25th and September 5th, respectively, as an appropriate release. At that time, the water force in the lower reaches of the Grand Canal was not vast. After opening the dams, the river water gradually rose, eventually submerging an area of 100,000 square li in the lower reaches of the Grand Canal. Although it has been dredged back into the sea for the past five or six months, it has not completely receded. Not only were the winter wheat crops unable to be planted last year, but also spring plowing this year has become a problem.

Recalling the Huai River flowing downwards in the 10th and 20th years of the Republic [1921 and 1931], the vastness of the water was many times greater than last year, but the recession time was very fast. Within two or three months, the embankments were fully exposed, and the water returned to its original state. It is known that the reason for the very slow recession last year was due to the Yellow River seizing the Huai River. Also, considering that at the time of the breach last year, the water volume in the Yellow River was not very large, but the impact of the flood on the lower reaches of northern Jiangsu was already so great. If the Yellow and Huai Rivers both rise, the expansion of the flood disaster in the future is even more difficult to predict. Therefore, although the breached areas of the Yellow River are more than a thousand li away from the counties in the lower reaches of northern Jiangsu, they are closely related, like shadows following each other. How can we stand by and not devise a way to manage it?

2.  The Importance of Blocking the Breached Areas

The principles of ancient and modern water management are to "examine the terrain," "understand the nature of the water," "consider the engineering," and "weigh the pros and cons." Now, let's discuss the situation of the Huai and Yellow Rivers merging separately:

The nature of water does not change from the past to the present, but the terrain has different changes. The Yellow River's entry into the Huai River began with Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty breaching the Hutuo River. The Yellow River's connection with the Huai River began with Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty breaching Shanghu [River]. At that time, there was Ze County and Tuntianjin to divide it, and Juye and Liangshan [mountains] to store it, so the harm was very small. When the Jin dynasty was under Zongshi, the Yellow River completely seized the Huai River. At first, it was still divided into two channels, but eventually they merged into one. At first, the Huai River was strong and the Yellow River was weak, and the estuary could still be scoured. Eventually, the Huai River was weak and the Yellow River was strong, and the estuary gradually silted up. The harm was already becoming increasingly severe. Later, during the Hongzhi period of the Ming dynasty, Liu Daxia built a dam to cut off Huanglinggang, and the northward flow of the Yellow River was cut off. The harm became unspeakable. At that time, breaches and overflows were constantly recorded in history. The most severe were the submersion of cities and towns [such as Honghu and Xuyi] and the transformation of fields into floating [land]. The disaster during the Longqing reign saw [the ruin of] Zhouguan's three hundred li of Honghu, the submergence of fertile land, and the expansion [of the river] to over seven hundred li. Now that the Yellow River has seized the Huai River again without any inquiry or attention, the Yellow River carries a large amount of sand. When it enters the Huai River and encounters a flat and vast lake, its flow is slow, and its current is scattered. The sand all settles. The lake is piled high, and the Yellow River in Zhengzhou has already met with more than 160 tributaries (see Chen Qiu's "Lower Chapters on River Management"). Surging southwards, the Huai River returns to Hongze, gathering the tributaries of seventy-two mountains and rivers, eagerly rushing east. The force is fierce. How can the small Jiangba, which flows into the river via the Grand Canal, and the Zhangfu River, which flows into the sea via the New Zhongshan River, act as its tail? As the ancients said, "When it overflows upstream, Fengyang and Siyang become wailing geese, and when it flows near Pangyu, Xuzhou and Haizhou will not have peaceful years" (see Tong Baocao's "River Management Discussion"), "if it does not flow eastward into the lower reaches [of the Grand Canal], it will flood Yangzhou to the south" (see Weng Tonghe's memorial). Honghu is bound to be filled with Yellow River sand, and how can the counties in the lower reaches of northern Jiangsu not become newly developed lakes? This is the first reason to "examine the terrain" and require blocking the breach. Rivers must have a tail, so there will be no calamities [of being] too cold or passing [the target]. The breaches at Huayuankou and Zhaokou last year were opened by the enemy troops to harm us. Fortunately, Heaven does not forsake us, and the flow rate per second was not very large, initially only 2,000 cubic meters, and eventually up to 5,000 cubic meters. However, the area affected by the water in the lower reaches of the Grand Canal has reached 100,000 square li. If calculated based on the maximum flow rate in previous years, the Yellow River has 18,000 to 22,000 cubic meters per second, and the Huai River has 16,000 cubic meters per second. The combined flow of the Yellow and Huai Rivers is about 38,000 cubic meters per second. Jiangba, with the three rivers flowing into Gaobao Lake, has 9,000 cubic meters per second. Comparing this flow rate with the combined flow of the Yellow and Huai Rivers, the ratio is one to four. Honghu is bound to be unable to accommodate it, and the Gaohe and other embankments will inevitably collapse. The current dams returning to the Yangtze River are obstructed by the enemy, so let's not discuss them for now. Even if the enemy retreats and all ten dams returning to the Yangtze River are opened, the flow rate flowing into the Yangtze River from Sanjiangying is only 6,000 cubic meters per second. Comparing this with the flow rate of the Yellow and Huai Rivers, the ratio is one to six. How can it flow smoothly out of the Yangtze River? Furthermore, let's talk about flowing into the sea. The path from the Zhangfu River into the New Zhongshan River, the newly developed river, is only one-third complete according to the plan, and the flow rate is only 500 cubic meters per second. Even if the flow rate from the Yan River is combined, it is only over 1,000 cubic meters per second, which is 5,000 cubic meters per second less than the flow into the Yangtze River from Sanjiangying. Therefore, the combined flow of the Yellow and Huai Rivers cannot flow smoothly out of the Yangtze River, let alone flowing into the sea. Flowing into the Yangtze River and flowing into the sea are both impossible. Even if all three dams returning to the sea are fully opened (because the Zhongzhao and Liangba dams have long been abandoned), the diversion flow rate is only 2,000 cubic meters per second. How can it fully release the combined flow of the Huai and Yellow Rivers? The flood is bound to overflow, affecting everything, and the counties in the lower reaches of the Grand Canal will become the return valley. This is the second reason to "understand the nature of the water" and require blocking the breach.

It is easy to treat a new illness, but difficult to treat a long-term illness. It is easy to treat a single illness, but difficult to treat a complex illness. Medicine is like this, and so is water management. If the Yellow River breaches, it should be treated quickly, and only the engineering of blocking the breach is sufficient. If the time is delayed, both the new and old channels must be treated. Also, consider the silting of the old channel. According to the memorial of Zhang, a river official during the Qing Dynasty in the 13th year of the Guangxu reign [1887], in the Zhengzhou breach, "the riverbed downstream is silting, with some areas accumulating four or five chi high, and some areas accumulating eight or nine chi high." The new channel is silting. According to Feng Guifen's "Changing the River Channel," "In the early years, it was three cun higher each year, and then it gradually increased each year, generally one chi higher per year. Not only does it not flow in the ground, but it does not flow on the ground, but flows directly on the city wall." Although the times are different now, the river is still the same. If the work of blocking the breach is not intensified, the flood will soon overflow, and there will be a situation where chasing and preventing it is impossible. Therefore, when the Yellow River breached the Guowa Xiang in the 3rd year of Xianfeng [1853], it was impossible to restore the old channel in the 5th year of Xianfeng [1855], and it was changed to flow into the sea via the Daqing River. The lessons of the past are not far away, and one should be vigilant. If the Yellow River is allowed to change its course at this time, the harm in the future will be too late to regret. This is the third reason to "consider the engineering" and require blocking the breach.

### Commercial Agreement Between France and Romania Takes Effect Yesterday; Romania Agrees to Supply France with One-Quarter of Its Annual Oil Production; Southern Agricultural Products Imported into France Receive Reduced Import Taxes

(Paris) The commercial agreement established between France and Yugoslavia is scheduled to take effect tomorrow. (Note: The commercial agreement between France and Romania also takes effect tomorrow.) Trade between the two parties is expected to double. When Southern agricultural products, especially corn, are imported into France, import taxes will be reduced. It is estimated that France will import 44,000 tons of corn from Yugoslavia in 1939. (France will also import 10,000 tons of corn from Romania.) (Havas dispatch, 31st)

(Paris) After the establishment of the commercial agreement between France and Romania, Commerce Minister Gentin gave an interview to a Havas reporter, stating that when the French commercial delegation visited Romania in November of last year, a plan had already been drafted. Although an agreement has recently been established with Germany, this plan has not been changed. The Franco-Romanian commercial agreement has therefore been announced. In the future, trade between the two parties is expected to develop significantly. Other countries will not be able to control Romania economically. As for the German-Romanian commercial agreement, Romania has not granted any exclusive rights to Germany. Its oil and other resources are intended to be developed with investment from Britain and France. (Havas dispatch, 31st)

Bucharest: Commerce Minister Purjehua recently signed a contract with French representative Wenger, stipulating that Romania should deliver one-quarter of its annual oil production, i.e., 700,000 tons, to France, and France will pay a tax of 200,000,000 tons as compensation. In addition, Wenger is in contact with Romanian authorities to purchase 490,000 tons of oil. (Havas dispatch, 31st)

(Paris) French Foreign Minister Bonnet, Commerce Minister Gentin, and Romanian Ambassador to France Titulescu signed the Franco-Romanian commercial treaty yesterday at the French Foreign Ministry. The treaty is valid for one year, with an exchange quota of 600,000,000 francs. The quota for France's purchase of Romanian crude oil has increased from 45,000 tons to 500,000 tons, and the heavy oil quota has also increased from 50,000 tons to 60,000 tons. In addition, France will purchase 800,000 "henteri" of Romanian corn (British weight, equivalent to one-twentieth of a ton), as well as large quantities of wood. As for Romania, it will purchase many kinds of French cars, motorcycles, machinery, medicines, and other goods. Arms transport has not been included and is stipulated separately in another agreement. After signing the agreement, the Romanian Ambassador gave a speech to reporters, emphasizing that Romania will not allow any country to monopolize its economic interests, because Romania is determined to maintain its economic freedom, just as it maintains its political freedom.

### Slovakia Accepts Hungarian Demands; Dispute Over Border Issues Agreed to Be Resolved

Budapest: Hungarian and Slovak peace representatives established a peaceful resolution plan yesterday. Details of this agreement will be finalized on Monday. Slovak representatives declared that they had accepted Hungary's proposal. Hungarian sources said that the front line should be moved twelve or fifteen miles to the west, as requested by Hungary. (Associated Press dispatch, 1st)

Bratislava: According to Slovak sources, the Slovak government has accepted Hungary's demands and agreed to cede eastern border areas of Slovakia to Hungary. It is reported that the Hungarian government demanded a response by noon yesterday. After Slovakia expressed its acceptance, negotiations on the implementation of the agreement resumed in the afternoon. (Haitong dispatch, 1st)

Capital of the Slovak State: Regarding the border issue between Hungary and the Slovak State, the Hungarian government had submitted a "memorandum" requesting the cession of several areas, with a deadline for a satisfactory response before noon today. The government of the Slovak State wired the German government yesterday, requesting its intervention. According to responsible sources, the German government has ordered its envoy to Hungary, Etfeistdorf, to demand that the Hungarian government cede several areas southeast of Bratislava to the Slovak State as an exchange condition for the land ceded by the Slovak State.

### Lithuania and Poland Negotiate Non-Aggression Pact

Warsaw: Lithuanian Minister to Poland, Suris, recently returned home to consult with government authorities on the issue of establishing a non-aggression treaty between Lithuania and Poland. This matter is nearing completion, and he is scheduled to return to his post tomorrow. The Lithuanian government has severed diplomatic relations with Poland since the city of Vilnius was occupied by Polish troops in 1920. It wasn't until after border disputes between the two sides in March of last year that Lithuania accepted Poland's ultimatum and resumed normal diplomatic relations and railway transportation.

### Eastern Newspaper Comments on the European Situation: Beating Around the Bush

(Tokyo) An editorial in today's "Daily News" stated that the reason the Soviet Union is hesitant and has not yet joined the anti-German pact is that it understands that danger will inevitably follow its joining. It is impossible for the Soviet Union to "pull chestnuts out of the fire" for Britain. The anti-German group is no different from Britain's "bulletproof vest." European countries that were previously used by Britain are now indifferent and unwilling to create a bulletproof vest for Britain. The newspaper recounted Italy's conquest of Abyssinia, the annexation of Austria by Germany, and the disintegration of Czechoslovakia, saying that Britain had encouraged these small countries to fight in order to protect its own interests, but when they fought to the point where they could no longer support themselves and were on the verge of danger, Britain abandoned them. Each time, Britain abandoned small countries like worn-out shoes for the sake of "peace." (Reuters dispatch, 1st)

### Complex Currency System in Xikang; Tibetan Government Issues Tibetan Banknotes; Kangding Mints Silver Coins

Kangding Correspondence: Xikang is located in the remote west, and its situation is very different from that of the interior. Even in terms of the currency system, it is extremely complex. The currency in circulation in the counties under the jurisdiction of Ya'an is the same as in the interior. In the counties under the jurisdiction of Jiulong, Linjing, and Ningyuan, which are close to Yunnan Province, legal tender, silver dollars, and copper coins are used together with "steel dollars." Kangding, as the provincial capital, has a mixed population of Han and Tibetan people. Legal tender is the main currency. Silver dollars, Tibetan silver dollars, and Tibetan banknotes are all circulating in the market. Nickel coins, copper coins, and small denomination notes are used as subsidiary currencies. In areas outside the pass with deeper Sinicization, such as Yajiang and Danba counties, there are three types of currency: Tibetan silver dollars, silver dollars, and copper coins. In Daofu, Luhuo, Ganzi, Zhanhua, Daocheng, Lihua and other counties, where Sinicization is relatively shallow, Tibetan silver dollars are mainly used, supplemented by Tibetan banknotes and copper coins. Silver dollars and legal tender are difficult to use. Because the people of Kang and Tibet only recognize Tibetan silver dollars and Tibetan banknotes, and most of them do not know Chinese characters, they refuse to use silver dollars and legal tender.

Tibetan Banknotes in Circulation: The Tibetan banknotes circulating in Kangding are printed by the Tibetan government. The denominations are all in Tibetan. People outside the pass and Tibetans mostly use them for transactions. Very few Han people use them. There are two types of Tibetan silver dollars: one is minted by the Tibetan government, and the other is cast by Sichuan Province. Tibetan silver coins minted by Tibet have Tibetan characters cast on them. Sichuan-made Tibetan silver dollars have the image of Emperor Guangxu of the former Qing dynasty on them. These two types of silver coins circulate in Kang and Tibet. Counterfeits are occasionally found, but they are very rare. In order to cope with the special environment and regulate social finance, the Xikang authorities have to mint Tibetan silver dollars to meet the needs of the counties outside the pass. The agency that mints these Tibetan silver dollars is the Xikang Tibetan Coin Mint, located on Zhongshan Street, South Gate, Kangding.

Visit to the Mint: On the morning of the 27th, the reporter visited the mint and was received by Director Yu, who gave a very detailed account of the history of the mint and the coin-making process. According to him, the mint was established in 1926 and has been in operation for more than ten years. It is now under the jurisdiction of the Department of Finance. The organization within the mint is simple, with more than ten staff members and more than ninety workers, most of whom are former employees of the Sichuan Mint in Chengdu, mostly from Sichuan. The silver and copper used by the mint are purchased locally as much as possible and cast day and night. Silver bricks are mostly transported to the mint by civilians for sale, with a market price of one yuan and ninety cents in national currency per tael. The price of copper is eight cents per catty. All military salaries and development of mineral production outside the pass require Tibetan silver dollars. The Tibetan silver dollars minted by the mint have a weight of three mace and two candareens per dollar, with seven parts silver and three parts copper. Two yuan are converted into one silver dollar or legal tender. Currently, four to five thousand yuan can be produced daily. When issuing silver bricks and counting the minted silver coins, they are weighed and measured. From melting the silver to casting, the process goes through more than ten steps. The loss of raw silver is 2% per hundred taels. The average working hours for workers are ten hours per day, with varying treatment. Some are paid monthly, while others are paid based on performance. For rough and strenuous work, such as hammering silver sheets, the wage is eight cents per hundred catties, with additional increases for more. Other skilled workers have monthly salaries starting from sixteen yuan, with some earning more than one hundred yuan per month, such as the workers who roll the coin patterns. After the silver coins are minted, they are delivered to the Xikang Provincial Bank, where the treasury manager takes charge. If the government needs to exchange hard currency to go outside the pass, it must obtain an exchange certificate from the Department of Finance. The certificate is in duplicate form, and after filling it out, the exchange can be made according to the number. According to a recent exchange certificate, the exchanger exchanged 7,500 yuan in legal tender for 15,000 yuan in Tibetan silver dollars.

Minting Silver Coins: After talking about this, Director Yu led a tour. First, we entered the workshop to observe the melting of silver bricks. The silver was placed in a jar, covered on top, and burned with charcoal fire underneath. Each jar of silver bricks was melted into silver juice in four hours and poured into a specially made steel mold, solidifying into long pieces. Next to it, workers held the cooled long pieces and trimmed them with knives. More than a dozen workers were hammering the silver sheets. Turning to the slicing department, we saw workers using machines to cut the silver sheets into squares one by one. There were also drilling workers who used machines to drill the squares into round shapes. Then, the edges were polished with a machine. At this point, it had become silver. Turning the billets to the billet cooking department, we saw a large pot with silver blanks stored in the water, and a raging fire was burning underneath. Next to it were billet washing workers who washed and polished the cooked billets one by one. Finally, we went to the embossing department, where there was a rolling machine. A round blank was placed in the concave pattern model, put into the machine, and two workers moved the machine and rotated it to press it. Others picked up the model, tapped it with a small hammer, and the silver coin fell to the ground. The reporter picked up one and saw that the silver color was clean and white, with a picture of Emperor Guangxu on one side and the words "Made in Sichuan Province" on the other. Director Yu talked about the silver problem, saying that the mint needed a lot of silver to mint silver coins, and that silver mines in Jiulong County had recently been surveyed and would soon be mined, so the source would not be lacking, and Tibetan coins could also be minted in large quantities. The reporter then said goodbye.

### Resource Committee Plans to Develop Gejiu Tin Mines; Past Mining Methods Urgently Need to Be Improved

Kunming Correspondence: Anyone who comes to Yunnan wants to go to Gejiu to see the tin production situation. But after seeing it, you will naturally get some more real impressions. In the mines, regulations are useless, and force is the most important thing. From the day Gejiu began to be discovered for tin production until today, most of the tin mines in Gejiu are still being mined using extremely primitive methods. In their local dialect, there are

Three Types of Mining: One is "grass skin tip," one is "hole digging tip," and one is "rushing tip." The "tip" here refers to mining. Grass skin tip mining is the easiest, almost digging out near the ground or even on the ground to wash out the tin. But the grass skin tip is too close to the ground, so the tin content is very small, only a few thousandths. But because it is more reliable, there is always some, and the cost is also lighter, so most people still do the "leather tip." The "hole digging tip" is to first identify the mineral veins,

Digging into the Hole: Some dig holes three or four thousand steps deep before they can mine tin. "Rushing tip" is another method, which is to dig several ditches on the high mountains when there is no rain, and when the rainy season comes, use natural rainwater to wash the soil containing tin from the mountains down the ditches, and also go through preliminary washing. However, this method does not produce much, and the number of people doing it is also the smallest. The so-called "sand miners" who work in the mines cannot walk around freely like other workers. They are guarded by people while they work, and after work they are locked in the kitchen. At night they are

Locked Up: At the beginning of each year, the foreman collects such people in the countryside, gives them twenty or thirty yuan for family expenses, and then leads them out. When they arrive at the mines, the sand miners belong to the mine owner. The mine owner stipulates the daily output of each sand miner. If this standard is not met, they are not dismissed from work, but the foreman carries out physical punishment, until he is beaten and scolded to the point where he can meet the production standard. And most of them are thirteen or fourteen years old, which is easier to manage. Some sand miners have

Even Worse Treatment: Because the owner's mines never produce tin. Doing this will not allow them to hope for anything even after doing it for years. This makes them want to escape. If they are caught back by the foreman or mine police, after being beaten and scolded, they have to work with shackles on their feet. The mine owners in Gejiu used to be known as the "Forty-Eight Big Factories," but now there are more than a hundred. But the number of these factories cannot be used as a standard for annual output, because not all of them are in operation. To estimate tin production, you need to know the number of sand miners. Last year, Gejiu probably used 80,000 to 100,000 sand miners. Every year in October,

They Start Selling Tin: The mine owners and workers can return to their hometowns one after another. When tin prices were good in the past, everyone made a fortune. At present, the situation is different. A friend said that the cost of digging tin in Gejiu is increasing, but the price of tin from London to Gejiu is decreasing. At present, the cost of living in Yunnan is high, and food is one or two times more expensive. Gejiu relies on external sources for everything except tin, so the rice, beans, and coal used for lighting are becoming more and more expensive. However, the tin price is determined in London. From London to Hong Kong, the tin price has to remove the Hong Kong commission. From Hong Kong, the funds are remitted to China. Hong Kong originally bought 1,000 catties of tin for about 1,700 Hong Kong dollars, which can be converted to 3,300 Chinese dollars, but

After Unified Control: The Fudian Bank only pays 2,200-2,300 yuan for 1,000 catties of tin. In addition, there are many donations and taxes, such as a 6% consumption tax and many other additional donations. I asked the owner of a small mine, and it is said that the cost of each 1,000 catties of tin with a small content is 2,500 yuan. Only those who open Wangdong can earn a few cents with such a tin price. (Note: Those with a content of more than 3% are called Wangdong. Those who are currently using new machines to mine are the new mines of the Tin Affairs Company, because they are vertical cuts and are very deep, so the content is always around 2%. Using elevators directly to the bottom of the mine, using a rope to transfer the ore from the mountain to the factory, and then using machines to wash the tin out. They can have a daily production of 3,000 catties of large tin. Recently, the Central Resources Committee is also planning on a large scale to

Develop Tin Production: Currently, we are seeing them making vertical cuts. In the future, they plan to dig so deep that even if the people's traditional methods of mining are used above it, it will never interfere with each other. As for their estimated output, it will at least be equal to the original output of the entire Gejiu.

### Barracks Hit by Shells in Hangzhou; Death Everywhere

Hangzhou Correspondence: Zhejiang Eastern Chinese Army strong troops have recently crossed the river one after another, preparing for a counterattack. It is known that on the 24th, the Chinese army on the south bank continuously shelled the Japanese army camp at Zhakou. Although the Japanese army retaliated once, the shooting was inaccurate, and the shells all fell on the barren suburban sand. Therefore, the Chinese position was not damaged at all, but three giant shells fired by the Chinese army hit the Japanese army camp, killing and wounding the Japanese soldiers stationed in the camp. Later, the Japanese authorities removed all the corpses and wreckage, loaded them into more than 20 trucks to Hangzhou, and then reloaded them onto trains in the afternoon to Shanghai, and then transported them back to Japan. According to eyewitnesses, there were more than 1,500 Japanese corpses transported from Zhakou to Hangzhou this time.

### Jiangsu Construction Department Rushes to Plug the New Dam

Xinghua Correspondence: The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, in view of the fact that the spring plowing season is approaching, and the accumulated water has not receded, which greatly affects agricultural production, Shen Baozhen and Secretary Xu rushed to Gaoyou a few days ago to work with a certain garrison of the county, in accordance with the telegram order of Chairman Han of the Provincial Government, to block the new dam. Construction has now begun, and it is expected to be completed no later than February 10th of the lunar calendar.

### Chen Caifu Betrays the Cause; Provincial Government Strictly Orders Apprehension

Haidou Correspondence: This county is isolated by the sea. Since Nantong fell, it has been isolated from northern Jiangsu. The regular army withdrew, and local people rose up to organize guerrilla units. Among them, Chen Caifu gathered young people and formed a guerrilla unit. Later, the county government obeyed the order of the provincial government to rectify the troops in various places, so it reorganized it and stationed it in the Niuhonggang Songjigang area along the river, assuming the responsibility of river defense, which was still competent. Unexpectedly, Chen was recently tempted by others and suddenly betrayed the cause, leading his troops to move without authorization. It has now opened up a base for the Japanese army in Sanchang. The provincial government, upon receiving the report, in addition to transferring other troops to fill the defense in the Niuhonggang area, strictly ordered its subordinates to take precautions, and even issued an order for his apprehension.

### Ministry of Finance Approves Tax-Free Rice for Guangdong; Totaling 1.2 Million Bags

Shantou Correspondence: The problem of rice shortages in Chaoshan has recently been satisfactorily resolved. Chen Huanzhang, Chairman of the Shantou Chamber of Commerce, made a special trip to Shaozhou to petition Zhang Fakui and Li Hanhun, and the Fourth War Zone Command and the Provincial Government requested the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance. Yesterday, Chen telegraphed from Shaoguan that the Ministry of Finance had approved a total of 1.2 million bags of tax-free foreign rice for Guangdong, with Shantou accounting for 700,000 bags, and the balance being allocated to Jiangmen, Zhongshan, and the Four Counties to help the people's food. Chaozhou merchants have already wired Siam to purchase a large batch of foreign rice and stored it in Hong Kong warehouses, waiting for the order to import. Two weeks ago, 20,000 bags were shipped to Shantou. Because the tax exemption matter had not been confirmed, the rice merchants paid customs duties as usual and landed them on the shore. At the same time, the Price Equalization Association also transported 30,000 bags of tax-free rice, which were equally distributed to each county according to the population. With one yuan in silver dollars, you can buy eleven catties of rice, and the people's suffering can be slightly alleviated. According to a survey by the Guangdong Provincial People's Food Adjustment Association, the province's annual shortage of rice is 1,460,4803 piculs. The above shortfall is entirely dependent on rice-producing areas at home and abroad to transport rice to Guangdong. According to a survey by the South China Rice Industry Company, last year 1 million metric tons of Wuhu rice were transported to Guangdong (each metric ton weighed 168 catties per bag), and about 300,000 bags of Hunan rice were transported south by train from Changsha. 2.5 million bags of tax-free foreign rice were transferred from Hong Kong. After the Shanghai war, the rice-producing areas in the Yangtze River basin fell, and the shipping route to Shantou was completely cut off. The rice from Wuhu, which Shantou depended on, was completely cut off. With the simultaneous fall of Wuhan and Guangzhou, the north and south sections of the Guangdong-Han Railway lost their transfer function. The rice from Changsha, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu could not be transported south, and the rice from Guizhou and Hunan, which the four counties of Panyu, Nanhai, Shunde, and Xinyi on the outskirts of Guangzhou depended on, was also cut off. Judging from the current situation, Guangdong Province is a historically rice-deficient area. If rice is not imported, there is no good way to remedy it. Before the early rice harvest, during the period between April and May when the old and new crops are not yet available, the people's food in Guangdong Province is indeed becoming a serious problem. According to past examples, it is estimated that 2.1 million metric tons (1 million bags in Chaoshan) must be transported to overcome the people's food panic before the closure.

### Department-Province Cooperation Loans to Develop Zhejiang Tea Industry

Lishui Correspondence: In order to increase Zhejiang's tea production, improve tea quality, and control foreign trade, the Central Trade Management Committee sent personnel last month to discuss tea cooperation loans and procurement methods with the Zhejiang authorities, allocated 3 million yuan for production loans and administrative expenses for tea management, and allocated 200,000 yuan for tea improvement expenses for increasing production, improving quality, promoting tea farmer cooperative organizations, and researching and improving tea-making tools. The allocation of this improvement fund includes 50,000 yuan for tea farmer cooperative undertakings, 93,340 yuan for tea testing and research expenses, 30,000 yuan for subsidizing research and improvement of tea-making tools and reward expenses, and 26,660 yuan for tea inspection expenses. Starting from March of this year, 60,000 yuan will be allocated first as start-up expenses for various improvement undertakings, and the rest will be allocated equally over nine months. At the end of the year, the Construction Department will prepare a final account and submit it to the Trade Committee for reference. There are also clear regulations on tea evaluation methods and loan audit methods. With this strong promotion of the tea industry in this province, its future development can be expected to be optimistic.

### Zhejiang Province Japanese Troops Crossing the River Repelled by Chinese Troops; Changes Among Hangzhou Puppets

Hangzhou Correspondence: This time, the Japanese troops forcibly crossed the Fuchun River and occupied Dongzhou Sand, Floating Sand. The burning and killing were quite tragic. On the 27th, Huang Shaohong's troops resisted the invaders and launched attacks on the area from different directions. The Japanese troops of the Tamura unit suffered heavy losses. Changsha Island and Yushan Island were recovered by the Resistance Guards.

### Japanese Troops in Rugao, Northern Jiangsu, Incapable of Offending North

The Zhaoguanba area has also fallen into a stalemate. It was previously rumored that some Japanese troops had been added to Tongru, intending to offend North and coordinate.

### Anti-Japanese War Experience and Lessons of the New Fourth Army in the Past Year

— Xiang Ying (6)

(2) Achievements of Civilian Work A. Judging from the actual work in the past six months, our civilian work has been established in general places, both in the front and in the rear. Precisely because of the efforts of our civilian work, the civilian movement has developed considerably. A large number of people were organized around our combat areas, which can be said to be our achievement. B. We have established a considerable number of mass organizations among the majority of the masses, especially in the areas near our army in southern Anhui and around our troops in southern Anhui, which is more effective than in the front. C. Because we have paid considerable attention to improving the lives of the masses, the masses in this area have improved their understanding of the war of resistance. Their participation in the war of resistance is not a formality but an action that can adapt to the needs of the war of resistance in some aspects. D. We have especially established general civilian armed forces in the front. Many bad civilian armed forces have been reorganized and trained to become anti-Japanese troops. E. Thanks to the achievements of our civilian work, our army and the people have truly become one, especially in the front, we can get a lot of help from the masses, which are the main points of our achievements.

### Future Trends in the War Situation in Southern Jiangsu

When we talk about the trends in the war situation in southern Jiangsu today, we can divide it into two aspects: one is the enemy's movements, and the other is our future policies.

(1) Predictions of Enemy Movements A. First of all, in terms of the war situation, the enemy is still defending and counterattacking, with defense as the purpose of the counterattack. This is the case in both southern Jiangsu and southern Anhui. Judging from the changes and developments in the overall war situation, the situation in southern Jiangsu may and must evolve from a defensive counterattack to a large-scale offensive against the guerrilla areas in southern Jiangsu. The entire war will turn to actively attacking the guerrilla areas. B. Secondly, in military terms, judging from past experience, the Japanese imperialists may mostly adopt the methods used in the Chinese civil war to deal with us, or build fortresses as strongholds, build roads, bridges, and cities as strongholds. Therefore, we say that the enemy may adopt the methods used in the Chinese civil war to deal with guerrilla warfare in tactics. Of course, it is not a complete move, but adds his own tactics. This shows that we should pay attention to the future forms of Japanese warfare development, and at the same time, we should use our past experience and, based on today's situation, develop our past experience. C. Thirdly, the Japanese imperialists use various methods to buy over some wavering armed forces and guerrillas, and disintegrate and weaken our anti-Japanese forces. In addition, they will organize many new puppet troops to create the power to attack the guerrilla areas and actually achieve the goal of using Chinese to control Chinese. I think this is possible both militarily and politically. D. Fourth, in terms of political disintegration, the enemy uses various methods to provoke. To alienate in order to disintegrate China's forces, to disintegrate China's anti-Japanese unity, so that the will of some people wavers, he uses grace. He also uses power, both grace and power to threaten wavering elements and destroy the unity of the entire Chinese people. Disintegrating the anti-Japanese forces in these areas. E. Fifth, carry out economic oppression, on the one hand, implement the policy of lock-in against guerrillas, and on the other hand, sell Japanese goods in large quantities in other places, use Chinese materials, and buy Chinese materials in large quantities, implement armed plunder of Chinese resources, buy over and raise a large number of traitors and double-dealers, establish his regime, and consolidate the rule of the occupied areas. This is a general estimate of the enemy's possible movements. Under such circumstances, if the enemy adopts such a policy, what methods should we take to deal with it?

(2) Our Future Countermeasures: First, in the future, politics is more important than military affairs. Relying solely on military power is not enough. We must launch guerrilla warfare from the political, economic, and military perspectives. We must rely on political power to mobilize the masses, organize, and mobilize the masses. We must rely on the combination of political and military forces to disintegrate the enemy, expose the enemy's deception, strengthen wavering elements, and consolidate national unity. Second, the people are more important than the army. Only the army, without the unity of the masses around it, is an isolated army. It is impossible to persist in the war of resistance under such difficult circumstances. Therefore, mobilizing the people, organizing the people, and arming the people are more important than the army. Third, propaganda is more important than combat: the enemy uses disintegration and sabotage to disintegrate and weaken our forces. We must expose the enemy's deception, unite the people in the war of resistance, and at the same time use propaganda to disintegrate the enemy's internal forces. In this way, propaganda work is more important than fighting. Fourth, spirit is more important than matter. Our army does not have enough understanding of the war of resistance. Therefore, we must strengthen the political work of our army, arm our minds, and establish our will, so that we can fight unswervingly. Fifth, in order to develop the anti-Japanese situation in this area, we must make guerrilla warfare a guerrilla warfare for the masses, not just a guerrilla warfare for the army alone, a mass armed struggle, not just an action relying on the army. Only in this way can we give the enemy blows at all times. (To be continued)

### The Guizhou Provincial Authorities Encourage the Education Sector to Serve as a Model for Teachers, Promoting Morality, and Rejecting Bad Habits, Working Hard, and Providing a Good Example for Young People

The Guangxi Provincial Government recently issued an instruction to all secondary school teachers and staff in the province, stating that to destroy the violent enemy, it depends on the unwavering national revolutionary spirit. In the 1807 Franco-Prussian War, Germany's defeat of France was due to elementary school teachers. From this, it is proved that our country and nation have suffered such aggression and oppression from the violent Japanese, which is due to the failure of our education to exert its great effect, that is, the guilt of our education sector to the country and the nation. From now on, those who serve as teachers for young people should thoroughly change their past mistakes, cheer up, temper their lives, reject bad habits, abandon lewdness, work hard, set an example by themselves, and provide a good model for young people, leading the people to actively mobilize, etc.

Sports News

### Italian Fascist Forces Control Tennis Sports, International Players Must Wear Uniforms, and Handshakes Are Prohibited After the Game

(Reuters, London, 31st) According to news from Rome, the Italian Terracotta Tennis Association has made a new important decision: henceforth, Italian tennis players attending international competitions must wear uniforms, and handshakes with opponents are prohibited after the game to avoid this kind of friendly expression that has long been a custom on tennis courts. The Association has also selected a number of formal referees to serve as referees for domestic and international competitions. These referees are all members of the Fascist Party.

Tennis Popularization

The Lawn Tennis Association is also cooperating with the Fascist Youth League to make tennis competitions popular and democratic, eliminating the idea that tennis is an enjoyment of the aristocratic class. All 1,500 tennis courts in the country, including private and hotel courts, must be made available to the Association. In order to train promising talented players, a large number of coaches will be hired. In this new plan, a large number of people have applied to serve as trainers.

### Finance Europe Crisis Increases, Cash Falls More Severely, Bulls Seek Escape from Germany More Urgently, Lowest at 2055 Yuan

Yesterday's situation in the unofficial cash market remained sluggish. This was primarily due to the increasing economic aid to China from various countries, which further strengthened the foundation of our legal currency. Furthermore, reports indicated that various national states were adopting firm stances, leading to a renewed sense of fear regarding the European war. As a result, operators viewed the trend in the unofficial foreign exchange market as more likely to ease than to tighten, dampening the enthusiasm of collectors. Moreover, nervous retail investors continued to reduce their holdings. Although some gold shops and money exchange businesses helped to absorb the supply on behalf of customers, it was still felt that supply exceeded demand. Consequently, prices successively broke through the 2070 yuan and 60 yuan levels, once reaching a low of 2055 yuan. Later, as some money exchange businesses took advantage of the low prices to continue purchasing, prices rose slightly. Ultimately, the price fell by ten yuan, with transaction volume similar to the previous day, approximately 610 taels. Gold jewelry followed suit, falling by two yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stagnant.

Fell by Ten Yuan

From the morning, the initial opening was influenced by reports that China's foreign loans were progressing smoothly and that tensions between Germany and Poland had resurfaced, leading to widespread anxiety. Consequently, the price broke through the 70 yuan level. At 9:40 AM, a gold shop initially offered ten taels to a silversmith at 2064 yuan, which was six yuan lower than the previous close. After the opening, retail investors successively sold off their holdings, and the market continued to weaken. The gold shop then sold fifty taels to a money exchange business at 62 yuan. Subsequently, the money exchange business sold fifty taels to a silversmith at 60 yuan, and the silversmith sold fifty taels to another money exchange business at 59 yuan. Later, another money exchange business, acting as an agent, sold fifty taels each to fellow businesses and gold shops at 58 yuan. Before long, a gold shop took in fifty taels each from fellow businesses and a silver shop at the same price. Soon after, the gold shop suddenly sold fifty taels to a money exchange business at 57 yuan. A securities firm also sold fifty taels to a money exchange business at the same price. Afterwards, gold shops conducted inter-dealer transactions for fifty taels at 55 yuan. Near noon, money exchange businesses conducted inter-dealer transactions for fifty taels at 56 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, as sellers suddenly stopped selling and adopted a wait-and-see approach, prices rebounded slightly. However, trading was extremely light, with only one gold shop selling fifty taels to a money exchange business at 60 yuan. Thereafter, sellers still wanted to sell at 61 or 62 yuan, but no transactions occurred. Therefore, the evening closing price remained at 2060 yuan, resulting in a fall of ten yuan compared to the previous close, with a daily range of nine yuan. The selling price of spot gold at cash shops was 2070 yuan, and the buying price was 2055 yuan. The spot premium remained fifty yuan lower than the listed gold price, with no transactions occurring.

Jewelry Reduced Twice

The exchange price for gold jewelry per tael was reduced by one yuan at 10:25 AM due to the weak underlying trend of spot gold. This was followed by another reduction of one yuan at 11:00 AM. Da Tong Hang revised its price to 209 yuan, while Xin Tong Hang revised its price to 207 yuan, with a buying price of 201 yuan.

No Change in Sterling

A Reuters dispatch from London on the 31st stated that the price of British pure gold per ounce remained at £7 8s 6.5d, resulting in the Chinese cash buying value at the Central Bank remaining at 1212.6 yuan. The listed customs gold price also remained at 2.396 yuan per tael, and the Shanghai standard bench gold price also remained stagnant at 1207.9 yuan.

### Gold Pound Plummets, Japanese Notes Exceedingly Cheap

Yesterday, the supply of British pure gold and British-American exchange rates did not change. Foreign firms' settlement of accounts was not strong, and the supply from foreign banks was smooth, maintaining a stable market value as before. The opening of spot gold continued to weaken due to the unsettled European situation. On the contrary, regarding our country's monetary system, Britain, the United States, France, Belgium, and other countries have successively provided assistance, undoubtedly consolidating the legal tender. Wealthy individuals who enjoy hoarding gold rushed to sell their holdings. In recent days, fewer people were buying, and the price gradually declined. The value of gold has reached its end. Many long positions were closed out in the morning, creating a very weak market. In the afternoon, silversmiths and money exchange businesses took advantage of the low prices to buy, and the downward trend gradually reversed. As a result, the price fell significantly compared to the previous evening. British and American gold pounds plummeted due to anxiety and increased selling by wealthy individuals, with few buyers. British and American gold notes also saw increased selling by wealthy individuals, with weak demand. Many Japanese gold notes were shipped to Shanghai, but the reserves were insufficient, leading to a weakening of confidence. Apart from special merchants' needs, patriotic citizens did not dare to hoard them, and the market price was extremely cheap. Only Hong Kong dollars returned to stability. Foreign banks absorbed them smoothly, and the devaluation rumors could not be confirmed. Public association transactions did not occur. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds fell by four dimes, British gold notes fell by three cents, American gold pounds fell by five dimes, American gold notes fell by 1.2 cents, Hong Kong notes rose by seven cents, French franc notes fell by five millimes, Annam notes fell by one cent, and the prices of other currencies remained unchanged.

### British Indian Silver Both Rise Slightly

A Reuters dispatch from London on the 31st reported that the silver market saw limited buying from India and limited selling from speculators. The market stabilized and closed flat. There was limited buying at the listed price after the close, but sellers adopted a wait-and-see approach. Large bars for near and distant delivery both increased by .0625. A dispatch from New York reported that spot American silver remained stagnant. A dispatch from Bombay reported that the Indian silver market was stable, with spot and futures prices continuing to increase by one anna.

### British-American Exchange Rate Remains Stable, Hong Kong Exchange Rate Slightly Tightens

Yesterday's exchange market saw several payments from the Tianjin Bank and foreign banks, but the amount was limited. Therefore, the supply from British and American banks was sufficient. Furthermore, despite the tense situation between Germany and Poland, the British-American exchange rate saw little change, resulting in continuous stability. Trading turned quiet, but the Hong Kong exchange rate tightened slightly.

Initially in the morning, London large bar prices for near and future deliveries all increased by .0625. New York silver prices remained stagnant. London bullion also saw no increases or decreases. The exchange rate against the pound fell by 1.3 cents, and was flat against the French franc and Shanghai. The US dollar saw no change against the pound, fell by .0625 against the French franc, and rose by .3 cents against Shanghai. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The banks' morning opening selling prices were 8.25 pence for the pound and 16.0625 yuan for the US dollar, with no changes compared to the previous close. After the opening, foreign firms and foreign banks had benefits, and although they successively purchased, HSBC and others were willing to release supply, resulting in a lack of fluctuations. Foreign firms profitably supplied HSBC, and the tariff rates remained unchanged, with the silver equalization tax announced to be 0.5 cents, totaling 4.50%. Thereafter, foreign firms and those with benefits settled with a Dutch bank at an exchange rate of 16.0625 yuan, resulting in continued stability. As transactions became scarce near noon, operators benefitted by half a cent. Only the Hong Kong exchange rate saw some transactions. Chinese banks sold Hong Kong exchange rates to foreign banks, which softened from 56 yuan to 55.875 yuan, slightly tightening the situation. The banks' closing selling prices at noon were 8.25 pence for the pound and 16.0625 yuan for the US dollar, which was the same as the morning opening. As a result, compared to the previous close, the British and American exchange rates saw no changes, while the Hong Kong exchange rate softened by .125. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.

### Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Unchanged, Tianjin Shanghai Down Five Dimes

### Discount Slightly Up

Yesterday's discount for bills was still 50 yuan per thousand, with the lowest at 49.75 yuan and the final at 50 yuan, a slight increase of 2.5 cents compared to the previous day.

### Securities, Domestic and Foreign Bonds Remain Weak

Yesterday's unofficial securities market remained stagnant and weak. The European situation had several attempts to maintain peace, but now it is reported to be tense again, and the impact is gradually widening. Although it is still in the brewing stage, the general public is already terrified. As a result, confidence cannot be boosted. Although the short sellers did not have significant pressure, the long sellers did not have the strength to raise prices again. Therefore, prices could not be raised and there was no significant fall. Yesterday, No. 63 bought at the opening, and Lianhe, Tongkang, and Hengfu also had considerable purchases, while Tiansheng, Runli, Tongde, and retail investors sold. However, transactions were very limited, and market prices were slightly down by two or three cents. In the afternoon, No. 38 bought from Zhongda, Fengzhi, and Dafeng, while Defu, Fengda, and Tongkang sold. Price fluctuations remained limited, and stability was maintained. As a result, prices were down by 1.5 to 3 cents. The total transaction volume was estimated to be around 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below:

Category, Highest, Lowest, Closing, Compared to Previous Day

Unified A, 57.10, 57.00, 57.10, Down 0.10

Unified B, 51.40, 51.10, 51.30, 0.15

Unified C, 50.85, 50.50, 50.65, 0.15

Unified D, 49.70, 49.50, 49.65, 0.25

Unified E, 49.90, 49.60, 59.70, 0.30

Stock transactions included 400 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, with 200 shares at 6.55 yuan and 200 shares at 6.60 yuan.

The London Chinese foreign currency bonds listed on the 31st of last month (Friday) saw the Salt Tax Guaranteed Crisp Loan continue to fall by half a pound to £37.5. Vickers Aircraft Bonds also fell by half a pound to £16.5. The rest remained unchanged. The previous day's transactions included £5,000 of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Loan, with a transaction price of £20, down half a pound from the market. Today's London physical supply included £1,000 of the Sino-British Gold Loan, with a price of £48.5, which was three pounds lower than the British listed price. There was also £2,000 of the Huguang Railway Loan with non-German printed lottery tickets at £23, at par with the market. There was also £2,500 of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Loan at £21, up 1.5 pounds from the market.

Separately, the interest on the Crisp Loan, secured by the salt tax, for the 13th installment, should have started paying in London on March 31st. The Chongqing Ministry of Finance spokesman added further clarification on March 30th regarding the statement on the handling of debts secured by the salt tax. One point specified that "the British and French loans due on April 5th will still be paid on time because the paying agency had previously received sufficient funds from the Ministry of Finance for repayment, but this can only be regarded as a special event." The Crisp Loan was not mentioned, leading to questions about whether the current installment of the Crisp Loan will be paid on time. Yesterday's London telegram reported that the Crisp Loan's market price on the 31st fell by half a pound compared to the 30th to £37.5, and it did not specify "ex-dividend." (According to previous years, the market price on March 31st, the payment date, was marked "ex-dividend.")

The London British Far East Company's stock prices on the 31st of last month (Friday) saw the market temporarily stabilize, and prices remained unchanged.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stock market report stated that the stock market this week was quiet. Most investors temporarily withdrew to wait and see. Stock prices at the opening were weak due to the sharp fall in New York stock prices overnight and various rumors about the European situation, causing market prices to trend downward. Jardine Matheson shares fell from 19.5 yuan to 19.2 yuan, but there were buyers absorbing the supply, and the closing buying price was 19.5 yuan. Trading was extremely active. Tram shares were priced at 40 yuan, with few buyers. Wheelock Marden shares remained firm, with buyers showing interest at 34.5 yuan. Rubber shares were neglected, but although London and New York rubber raw materials were affected by the unstable European political situation, prices remained relatively stable. It is unlikely that the local stock market will be significantly affected by the development of the European situation. Once there is a turnaround, there will be a rising trend.

### Yarn and Cotton, Yunnan and Hong Kong Continue to Purchase, Yarn Sales Rise, Japanese Yarn Sells Well in Guerrilla Areas

The yarn market is stable and tranquil. This is because there is a steady demand for 20-count Double Horse yarn in the South China region, including Hong Kong and Yunnan. As for 10-count coarse yarn in Tianjin, there is an urgent demand. Because Japanese factories have long been phasing out and not spinning this type of cotton yarn, it can only be purchased from Chinese factories. Therefore, each factory has a sense that supply cannot meet demand, and some yarn factories have changed the spindles and increased spinning. As a result, confidence is strong, the speculation has stopped, and the market is gradually recovering. Judging from the market situation, there may be a strong rotating force in the short term. In addition to the continued rise of one yuan in the afternoon, Chinese yarn was supported by the firm price of Japanese yarn. Moreover, colleagues discussed that its decline was not shallow, and the desire to buy suddenly increased. The closing price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 375 yuan.

The current situation of yarn. The initial opening was because there were few people attending the meeting, so it did not start until 10:30. Yongxing sold 20-count Double Horse spot at a price of only 370 yuan, down one yuan from the previous day. Then, Guangbang Wanxing continued to purchase spot yarn in the market on behalf of Hong Kong dealers, and some others also came to purchase, and the market price suddenly became tight again, rising two yuan. The spot price of 20-count fluorescent horse was 373 yuan, and the base of 10-count yarn has fallen, and the spot goods of each factory have been sold out, and the market situation is particularly good. The Yunnan gang also needs it, and 10-count Te Jincheng suddenly jumped 3.5 yuan to 303.5 yuan. The market situation was very tight in the afternoon. The 20-count Double Horse yarn rose another two yuan, reaching 375 yuan. It is estimated that all the gangs bought a total of 1,375 bales throughout the day, the price of 20-count Double Horse Tiannv rose 3 yuan to 2 yuan, Te Jincheng rose 5 yuan, 32-count Muyang jumped 9 yuan, 10-count coarse yarn Te Jincheng rose 4 yuan, Yong'an Factory opened 40 bales of 20-count Te Jincheng yarn, the price was 390 yuan. 400 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped from Ningbo yesterday, 215 pieces of yarn were shipped to Fuzhou today, and 800 pieces will be shipped to Tianjin tomorrow. The amounts bought by each gang are listed as follows: Hong Kong 360, Fellow Traders 610, Shantou 65, Xiamen 55, Inland 75, Tianjin 55, Yunnan 150, Wenzhou 5, Total 1,375

The Japanese yarn market started with a moderate and stable trend, but the trend is still firm. Most people are optimistic, and the local business is not prosperous, but the sales market in the guerrilla area is more prosperous. Therefore, the major dealers are all in the long position. The spot price of 20-count Shuiyue yarn is 342-343 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Lanfeng yarn is 332-333 yuan, which is 1-2 yuan higher than the previous day.

### US Loan Cotton Issue Still in Dispute, Only Brazilian Cotton Active in Foreign Cotton Transactions

In the foreign cotton market, New York cotton opened and fell due to the Liverpool telegram's price drop, and then rebounded due to some short covering. The disposal of the US government's loan cotton is still in dispute, and the global industry is closely watching this issue. As a result, cotton transactions seem to be entering a state of stillness. Yesterday, Southern lawmakers again cited wartime preparedness precedents, stating that cotton is a military commodity and demanding that the government store 7 million bales of cotton to prevent unforeseen needs. This proposal will continue to be discussed next week. Yesterday, New York rose five points, India, including forecasts, rose half a rupee, Egypt fell more than ten points. Converted to legal tender, American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose three cents per picul, Indian cotton rose half a rupee, and block and fell more than seven cents.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, due to the difficulty of transporting Indian cotton, the cotton previously ordered by various factories has not arrived on time. Therefore, the cotton procurement targets of various factories have shifted to American cotton. However, the inventory of American cotton on the market is scarce and will soon be exhausted. Therefore, in recent days, the attention of various factories has shifted to Brazil. There have been large orders this week, but only a little more than 1,000 bales belonged to Chinese factories. The foreign cotton prices for yesterday are listed below:

Raw Materials, Category, Delivered to Factory with Tax

60-count Egyptian Cotton, High Grade, 104.35

Also, Medium Grade, 101.45

80-count Also, High Grade, 39.40

Also, Medium Grade, 29.20

20-count American Mitterling, 83.65

Also, Lower Grade, 70.50

32-count Also, 92.33

Also, Lower Grade, 81.45

42-count Also, 94.15

Also, Lower Grade, 81.40

Also, South American Brazilian Cotton, High Grade, 87.95

Also, Medium Grade, 84.60

Also, Lower Grade, 75.5

10-count Indian Ping Guoer, 62.15

16-count Indian Omura, 64.75

20-count White Zone, 72.50

24-count Indian Pengga Pu, 79.90

32-count American Xinte, 85.05

32-count 42-count American Pengga Pu, 89.50

### Heavy Domestic Taxes and Duties, Cotton Merchants Earn Very Little Profit, Sources of Local Cotton Decrease Again

The local cotton transactions, which were relatively prosperous on the previous day, returned to a bleak path yesterday. This is because the factories' intentions have weakened due to the impact of sluggish yarn sales. However, the sales of coarse yarn are very good, so Yao clothes are uniquely consumed. At the same time, Japanese factories are also ordering a lot of foreign cotton, but there is still a need for bright and lustrous purchase rights. Therefore, although transactions are light, it is difficult for the transferred price to fall. However, Tongzhou cotton fell four cents compared to the previous day, and the price of Fire Machine cotton was flat. According to some transporters, the profit from cotton arriving in Shanghai recently is very small, and the domestic taxes and miscellaneous expenses are huge. Therefore, the source from northern Jiangsu has decreased again. 569 pieces of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the pier, 2,010 pieces of Yao cotton came from Ningbo, and 170 pieces of cotton came from Xingang. 280 pieces of cotton machine cotton will be shipped to Tianjin tomorrow. The current situation of cotton is recorded on the left:

North Road Taicang, 76.00, Shenxin No. 2 Factory entered, 320 bales, Huihua delivered to the factory

Fire Machine Cotton, 70.50, Yuanxingde entered, 20 bales, cash at the wharf

Tongzhou Cotton, 76.80, Xinyihao entered, 30 bales, Huihua at the wharf

Fire Machine Cotton, 70.50, Fellow traders entered, 300 bales, Huihua at the wharf

Yao Clothes, 66.00, Xinyu Factory entered, 2,000 bales, Huihua delivered to the factory

### Imported Foreign Cotton, Obstructed at Sea

Artificial silk Also, a large batch of more than 3,000 boxes of artificial silk and cotton, has arrived in Shanghai. It is reported that the Tilawa of the Dadong Company, managed by the Great Britain Company, was loaded with 5,135 tons of cotton from Mumbai, about 14,000 bales. Also, the Mallore, also managed by the company, carried 2,980 pieces of cotton from Kolkata. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at noon yesterday, but there was no news of the arrival of the second round until 6:00 PM. It may have been obstructed by wind and fog on the sea surface. It should arrive today and is scheduled to dock at Qichangsheng in Pudong to unload. Also, the Italian ship ConteVerde, carrying a large batch of 3,887 boxes of artificial silk from Italy, will arrive at noon tomorrow (3rd) and dock at Shuntai Wharf (Concession) in Hongkou.

### Grain, Local Flour Turns Stable, Foreign Flour Will Arrive Successively, Spot Goods Fall Again

Yesterday's transaction of spot flour from local factories was very ordinary. As it was the weekend, both local customers and wholesalers were slack. Since the third batch of special values from the Beiyang area was sold, there were also purchases of foreign flour at the same time, and there were not many berths, so new transactions were lacking again. The Nanyang gang has weakened, and there are only daily retail transactions in the local street. However, according to factory news, local flour and foreign flour are competing, and prices have fallen a lot. The foreign flour in the hands of the firms is mostly unwilling to sell too cheaply due to cost reasons, while the factory's local wheat raw material price is above seven yuan, which is very different from the cost, so it is unwilling to continue to lose money. The market seems to be temporarily stable, and it may change slightly at the beginning of next week.

Foreign flour The foreign flour market was clearly stable and secretly loose yesterday. Foreign telegrams were checked and fell slightly, and the combined price was US$2.5 per barrel. It is difficult to combine futures, and the spot market is full. In addition to the retail arrivals, it is heard that another ship will arrive next Tuesday, April 4, with an estimated 5,000 barrels, totaling more than 200,000 bags. Therefore, confidence has weakened. Although there is no large-scale rush to sell bulk goods on the market, spot goods are sold one after another, causing the market to secretly jump again. Yesterday, it was heard that the standard flour of High Brand No. 2 was still sold at 4.1 yuan in cash, while the middle-grade brand was secretly reduced by 5 cents. After a large amount of foreign flour arrives in Shanghai, it is once again depreciated by local flour. The competition between the two, the future of foreign flour, is also not shallowly hampered by the factory flour.

Exports 2,500 bags will be shipped to Fuzhou today, and 40,000 bags will be shipped to Tianjin tomorrow.

### No Transactions of Thick Japonica Rice

Yesterday's source of japonica rice was that 4-5 Hao arrived at Hexia, and Baizi arrived in Chelun, nearly 2,000 bags of Su Tong Gang and Kunshan, and more than 2,000 bags of Jiangyin Gang. In terms of sales, local street shops and hoarders continued to be slack, while the selling side's ideas were still firm, resulting in a stalemate for several days without change, and still a fixed pattern. At the same time, there were few transactions of each item, and Su Tong Gang japonica rice did not have a single grain of rice traded yesterday. This kind of state seems to be a bad sign to lose based on foot. As for the clear and thin japonica rice, the market is as usual. Sheyang Jian and Bu Jian are rare and tight, and the variable yuan has been reduced by 2 cents due to the poor destination. Yinyuan is flat.

After being tired for several days, the market atmosphere of Ke Xian was still weak yesterday. After the market opened in the morning, floating hoarders and scattered sellers all sought to sell, and the market prices were generally down by 5-6 cents to a dime. Nanjing Gao Xian was difficult to sell because the cargo owner was playing smartly. However, the cargo of steam Xian of the big city was slightly distinguished from the hoarding and zero households at a low price, and the cargo of 12.5-6 and 7-8 yuan was more flexible. However, the number of transactions in the unified market was still less than 2,000 bags.

### Oil Cake, Soybean Oil is Threatened by Control, Market Price Rises by Three to Four Yuan, Futures Trading is Suspended as a Result, Peanut Oil also Responds with a Soaring Price

Yesterday, due to the fact that Dalian fell by two yuan again, the soy oil market in this port was threatened by the fact that the unified control issue had become a reality, so the people's hearts were seriously threatened by this, and the futures trading has been suspended. However, the Japanese merchants have few remarks on the futures they have thrown, and whether there is a change in the situation depends on the situation of Siqi 1. At the moment, all parties in the market are vying to buy spot oil, and the shouting is quite alarming. In addition to the opening of Dalian oil, which was raised by two yuan, the result rose by three yuan and seven corners compared to the previous day, and other plates also soared every plate. A total of 500 barrels of Dalian oil were traded, and the price ranged from 36 yuan to 37.5 yuan. 320 pieces of Lian Qi oil were traded at a price of 34 yuan, 35 yuan, and 300 pieces of Yan Qi oil were traded at a price of 25 yuan to 27 yuan. 500 listening sessions of Da You Factory oil were priced from 28 yuan to 28.8 yuan, and 1,000 listening sessions of Suifeng Factory oil were priced from 33.5 yuan to 36 yuan. Peanut oil also responded with a soaring price, and the market price soared by seven corners to 1.5 yuan from the opening to the closing. It is estimated that 250 pieces of Yantai Ye oil were opened, and the price was 28.8 yuan, 29.5 yuan, and 2,000 listening sessions of Tianjin canned oil were opened, and the price was 37.5 yuan, 39 yuan. The soy cake has not yet been involved in the vortex of unified control, and the co-operation is as mediocre as before. Yesterday, the Lian Guang cake for June still opened at 3.1 yuan and 5.5 cents, and 6,000 pieces were traded.

### North-South Goods, Jian Mushrooms Continue to Rise by Ten Yuan

According to news from the Min market, Fujian shiitake mushrooms continued to rise by ten yuan. If a batch continues to arrive recently, it has been sold, and it is estimated that Huabu mushrooms will be 250 yuan and 9 cents, and Pucheng mushrooms will be 230 yuan and 6 cents.

### Silk Tea, European Situation is Unstable, Foreign Silk Falls Sharply

In the foreign silk market, due to the unstable European situation, all silk prices have fallen sharply. New York is down two to three cents, and the exchange opened down three and a half to four cents. Yokohama's opening prices have fallen below the 1,000 yuan level, and it is estimated that the prices of each small lot are about 20 yuan. The price difference in Lyon is referred to. The Shanghai silk market has become less and less promising due to the slump in foreign silk prices, which has made people's hearts decadent. French bankers continued to purchase more than 20 dan of Shuang Gong Jing 150-200 Jiao Wen at a price of 840 yuan. The banks in Yin Fei were silent. Yesterday, there were 109 pieces of tea shipped from Ningbo.

### Textiles: Yantai Suddenly Purchases a Large Quantity of Dasheng Factory Cloth; Samsung and Kui Xing Suddenly Increase by Fifty Cents; Sales of Eastern Fine Cloth Also Strong in the North

Due to yesterday's overcast and rainy weather, business in this street and various wholesale routes has been temporarily slow. The sales prices for cleaned, dyed, and finished cloth remain firm. Most factory products are still delivered to this street. Yesterday, buyers from Yantai suddenly purchased over two hundred and several tens of pieces of Dasheng goods, including sixteen-pound Samsung, Kui Xing, and Shuanglong coarse cloth. However, since the Dasheng factory in Nantong was occupied by Japanese forces and forced to cease operations, the supply source has been cut off. Existing inventory in Shanghai is also becoming scarce. This large-scale purchase by the Yantai group is the first of its kind this year, causing the market to tighten suddenly. As a result, Samsung and Kui Xing have each increased by fifty cents per piece, sixteen-pound Shuanglong has increased by thirty cents per piece, and sixteen-pound Blue Lion Kui character has increased by fifteen cents per piece. However, sales of products from other factories remain slow, as buyers specifically seek out Dasheng goods. It is said that asking prices remain flat, and the overall textile market is showing signs of tightening. New transactions for fine cloth and fine twill are sluggish, and the trend remains weak. Buyers from Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan are still actively purchasing colored twill and colored cloth, with over five thousand pieces reported to have been shipped yesterday, mostly transshipped through Mazhangguan in Guangdong.

Sales of Eastern cloth started weak but ended strong, with no significant ups or downs. Buyers from Tianjin and Qingdao in the north continued to purchase over five hundred pieces of fine cloth and fine twill. Transactions for dyed vegetables in this street also reached over five hundred pieces. The sales price for twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth remains at twelve yuan and ten cents, with high offers of twelve yuan and fifteen cents for fine twill and Dragon Head cloth, but no transactions. Industry players remain confident. Twenty pieces are being exported to Fuzhou today, and two hundred and eighty pieces will be shipped to Tianjin tomorrow.

### Seafood: Shark Fin Is Popular

Various organizations in this city are urging people not to eat shark fin, but shark fin sales are still strong in this street and among buyers. There is not much domestic production. For example, Jiazi Pi Dao fin has been out of stock for a long time. The remaining supply comes from Fujian Qing fin, which is gradually arriving on the market and currently sells for three hundred thirty to three hundred forty yuan. Western Huang Ji fin sells for eight hundred yuan, and Dan Dui sells for five hundred sixty yuan. There is no shortage of East Asian goods on the market. Taiwan fin sells for three hundred twenty yuan, and large batches of Qing fin sell for three hundred forty to three hundred fifty yuan.

### Hardware: Tea-Producing Areas Fall to War Zones; Lead Market Declines

The demand for lead typically peaks at the start of the new tea season, and its annual transactions are usually guided by this trend. However, since the current year, tea-producing areas such as Hangzhou, Anhui, and Jiangxi have fallen to war, the local lead market is in a state of severe decline. Yesterday, only a little over one hundred dan were sold. The market price for foreign lead is forty yuan per dan, Hunan native lead sells for thirty-seven yuan and fifty cents per dan, and mixed lead is only priced at twenty-eight yuan. Transactions by local paint companies, yellow cinnabar factories, type foundries, tin foil factories, printing houses, and newspapers are also extremely quiet.

### Imports and Exports: Large Quantities of Paper and Eggs Arrive

Yesterday, one thousand three hundred and fifty-five pieces of tallow oil arrived from Wenzhou, and one thousand pieces of cottonseed cake arrived from Ningbo. Today, fifty pieces of tung oil and six hundred and eighty pieces of tallow oil arrived from Ningbo.

Yesterday, an additional one thousand nine hundred and nineteen pieces of fresh eggs arrived from Ningbo and two thousand and five pieces from Xingang.

Three thousand seven hundred and fifty pieces of pine planks arrived from Fuzhou the previous day.

Goods exported to Europe the previous day included twenty pieces of wool, sixty-seven pieces of egg yolk, eighteen pieces of hair, forty-four pieces of casings, and thirty-three pieces of silk. This was shipped to India.

### Japanese Side Openly States They Will Not Suppress Anti-Foreign Movement; Newspapers in Occupied Areas Are Particularly Fierce Against Britain; Missionaries Also Suffer Discrimination from Puppets

The Continental Daily News reports that Chinese-language newspapers published in Japanese-occupied areas have launched a movement in the past two weeks to express anti-foreign sentiment, especially against Britain. The Japanese authorities will not suppress this movement as long as it does not disrupt peace and order. This was stated by a Japanese spokesperson at a reception for reporters last night (March 31st). He had previously stated last week that he was unaware of this movement. Last night, after reporters repeatedly questioned him about this matter, he completely changed his attitude. Through an interpreter, he stated that it is not inaccurate for the newspapers to express opinions about the history of British actions in China and the recent actions of the British government. When a reporter inquired if this meant the Japanese authorities were permitting anti-British movements, the spokesperson gave a somewhat ambiguous answer, saying there was no relationship between the two. This was the spokesperson's personal opinion. Another reporter asked if the Japanese military was directly supervising Chinese-language newspapers in occupied areas, as they had been conducting anti-British movements in editorials for the past ten days. The spokesperson replied that he was not very clear on this point, but that all publications were subject to Japanese inspection.

The spokesperson added that the Japanese authorities cannot suppress Chinese people expressing anti-British opinions in Japanese-occupied areas as long as they do not disrupt peace and order. He then reiterated that there was indeed anti-British sentiment, and it was inevitable that this sentiment would be expressed in print. Another reporter pointed out that the editorial movements were primarily anti-British and asked what actions Britain had taken to aid China that the United States had not. The spokesperson replied that the inquirer, as a reporter, should be better informed than the spokesperson, and this may be due to the attitude of Britain. A reporter asked if the spokesperson meant that the Japanese authorities would only suppress the movement when the result was that the shops or buildings of British or other foreigners were pelted with stones or damaged. The spokesperson answered in the affirmative. A reporter inquired why British, French, and American individuals were highly regarded in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, but people in coastal areas were being deliberately incited to hate foreigners, which was strange. The spokesperson did not reply. Another asked if the principle of suppressing anti-Japanese sentiment applied by the Municipal Council in the Public Concession should also apply to suppressing anti-foreign sentiment in Japanese-occupied areas. The spokesperson stated that overall, there was no encouragement of anti-foreign sentiment in occupied areas. A reporter asked if there was currently anti-British propaganda being promoted. The spokesperson replied that it was not being promoted but arising naturally. A reporter asked if the Public Concession was doing everything possible to suppress anti-Japanese sentiment. The spokesperson did not reply. A reporter asked if the Japanese authorities hoped Chinese would return to occupied areas, how could they do so without hindering military operations, and were people from third countries being hindered? The spokesperson made an excuse, saying that the difference lay with people from third countries, whereas for Chinese, he was silent. It is known that after the puppet authorities recently started a fierce anti-foreign movement in Nanjing, the movement had spread to the entire occupied area, especially Hangzhou. Even in Shanghai, echoes could be heard. After studying the newspapers' commentaries and opinions expressed in editorials, all were similar, so the only conclusion that could be reached was that these newspapers were all receiving common instructions. The fact that they uniformly supported the continued resistance and urged the government for strong assistance in the Public Concession and Chongqing-controlled areas proved that they were instructed to express anti-foreign sentiment. Although the Japanese spokesperson claimed to be unaware of this at the press reception yesterday, foreign newspapers had long known that the Chinese-language newspapers published in occupied areas were all under the direct control of the Japanese military's "Special Affairs Department." Translations of editorials from Hangzhou newspapers in the past ten days revealed that the local newspapers were calling on Chinese to "restore China's new order" and urging people of color to oppose the "vicious white race" and establish a "new order." Hangzhou newspapers published slogans in bold font, such as: (1) Britain is trying to make China another India; (2) Expel the terrifying and malicious British; (3) Drive away the blood-sucking British; (4) Remove the evil influence of Britain; (5) Tear off Britain's mask; (6) Overthrow our enemy, Britain, etc. Even foreign missionaries were not spared the puppet's anger, as one editorial stated that missionaries were the pioneers of China's exploitation.

### Vehicles on Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Withdrawn to Hunan-Guangxi Railway; Direct Trains Suspended; Linpu-Guixi Section Still Open

Since the Japanese army's attempt to cross the Fuchun River failed, our elite troops have crossed the Qiantang River to attack the Japanese army and are on strict alert along the coast and rivers of eastern Zhejiang. Due to the military situation in Nanchang, direct trains on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Hunan-Guangxi railways have been suspended. Vehicles on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway were prepared in advance and withdrawn to the Hunan-Guangxi Railway. The section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Xiaoshan to Linpu was dismantled when the National Revolutionary Army withdrew from Hangzhou. It is rumored that the authorities plan to dismantle the section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Nanchang to Linpu. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with shipping companies yesterday about the dismantling, but it could not be confirmed. Currently, train service on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway runs from Linpu to Guixi only. However, most of the passenger cars, freight cars, and locomotives have been withdrawn to the Hunan-Guangxi Railway, so there is an extreme shortage of vehicles on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway recently.

### Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Area: International Settlement Volunteers March Today; Over Two Thousand Volunteers Participating; Annual Review Scheduled for the 16th

Since the Shanghai War, the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteers have provided the Municipal Police Department with the greatest assistance in police work. In view of the fact that many hoodlums are hiding and bandits are running rampant in the extra-settlement road area of western Shanghai, causing anxiety among the residents, in order to assist the police in suppressing bandits and eliminating disturbances, it has been specifically decided to hold a large-scale review parade in the western district of Shanghai starting today. The teams participating in the review parade include A, B, and C Companies, the Machine Gun Company, the Air Defense Company, the Armored Car Company, and the White Russian Detachment, totaling over two thousand people. The parade routes include Great Western Road, Yidingpan Road, Dunxin Road, Yuyuan Road, Bailinan Road, Haige Road, Jessfield Road, etc., covering all roads in the area built beyond the concession. The police will also dispatch a large number of detectives and Indian cavalry units to bolster the momentum. It is also rumored that the general review of all members of the International Settlement Volunteers in 1939 has been scheduled for April 16th at the Racecourse, with Municipal Council Chairman Mr. Fessenden as the reviewing officer.

### British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen to Visit Chongqing in Mid-April; British Ambassador to Japan to Meet Italian Ambassador Mazuco in Shanghai Before Heading to Beijing

According to the Shanghai Times, personnel at the British Embassy here stated yesterday (March 31st) that the British Ambassador to China, Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen, will travel south by ship in the second week of April, first to Chongqing. Although there is no official news about the purpose of Knatchbull-Hugessen's trip, it is of great significance due to the arrival of the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, on Tuesday. Although official circles claim that Craigie's visit is for vacation, it is expected that he will meet with Knatchbull-Hugessen. The arrival of the new French Ambassador, Mr. Cosme, has been delayed due to the collision between the General Joffre and Guangdong ships near Hong Kong. According to news from Hong Kong, the General Joffre suffered significant damage to its bow and will remain in the Hong Kong shipyard for repairs for about three weeks. Ambassador Cosme, who had just presented his credentials to the Central Government in Chongqing, telegraphed Shanghai stating that he had not yet made arrangements to come to Shanghai. However, it is rumored that the French cruiser Bougainville sailed from Saigon to Hong Kong yesterday, and the new ambassador may take that ship to Shanghai. It is also heard that the Italian Ambassador Mazuco, who left Shanghai on the Italian warship Curtatone on Monday, is heading to Beijing.

### Shanghai Municipal Police Closely Guard the Court; Fourth Term of Special Court Agreement Began Yesterday; Police Still Sending Criminal Cases as Usual

The former Mixed Court of the International Settlement was abolished through the efforts of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1927, with the consent of relevant countries, and reorganized into the Provisional Court of the Shanghai International Settlement and the Court of Appeal. On April 1, 1930, after the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and relevant countries re-established an agreement, it was reorganized again into the current Shanghai First Special District District Court and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The organization and trial of the two courts are entirely based on Chinese law. Only the position of judicial police chief is filled by a foreign national recommended by the Shanghai Municipal Council and appointed by the court.

### Japanese Soldiers Disguised for Searches; Squad Leader Zhu Tragically Stabbed to Death; One Farmer Shot Dead on Holberton Road; Disguised Japanese Soldiers Searching and Reconnoitering Everywhere

Recently, the guerrilla forces in the suburbs of Shanghai have been unusually active. The Japanese troops in various places have retreated to the newly built fortresses and dare not cross the defense line. Recently, the Japanese side recruited over one hundred tailors in a factory on Xietu Road and Damuqiao Road, making Chinese-style clothes day and night, which were issued to Japanese soldiers. Disguised as Chinese villagers, they went to various villages in groups of three or five to inquire about the whereabouts of the guerrilla forces and asked to see residents' ID cards. If anyone looked suspicious, they were identified as guerrillas or bandits and shot on the spot. For example, the other day, near Holberton Road and Great Western Road, two Chinese farmers were shot by four Japanese soldiers in Chinese clothes riding in a car. One died and one was injured. Yesterday, at about 1:00 PM, six or seven Japanese soldiers, dressed in blue cloth shirts and pants, wearing aprons, and disguised as workers, were riding in a truck on Zhanghong Road, east of Hongqiao Town in western Shanghai. At that time, Zhu Qiusheng (a local, 26 years old), the leader of the Fourth Independent Squad of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army, and squad member Jiang Renqi (from Chongming, about 30 years old, living at Wangjiazhai, South Wangjia House), were passing by on business. The disguised Japanese soldiers spotted them, got out of the car, and searched them. Zhu and Jiang were unable to escape and were found with code symbols on their bodies. They were immediately tied up and taken to the cemetery behind Anguo Temple, where they were brutally murdered. The two martyrs generously died for their country, which is truly heartbreaking. In the future, loyal and brave soldiers should pay attention to this.

Japanese Troops in Nanxiang Retreat to Jiading

The Japanese troops in Nanxiang on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, only a small squad of more than twenty men, were constantly attacked by the security regiment. Fearing that they would be surrounded, they quietly retreated last night (March 31st) and concentrated in the city of Jiading. The Nanxiang area is now under control and is advancing to nearby areas.

The Agreement is Still Valid After Expiration; The Agreement is Three Years; If Six Months Before Expiration, The Parties Concerned Do Not Raise Modification or Abolition Issues, The Extension will be Three Years; The 31st of Last Month Was the Expiration Date of the Third Term of the Agreement, and the Parties Concerned Have Never Raised a Request to Amend or Abolish the Agreement Before the End of Six Months; Therefore, According to The Agreement, The Extension Should Be Granted Again.

The Dream of Puppet Organization Receiving is Dashed; However, the Puppet Organization "Mayor of Shanghai" Chuan Xiaonan, in Fact, Recently Submitted a Document to the Municipal Council, Requesting the Municipal Council to Hand Over The First Special Court to The Puppet Organization for Receiving; It Is Important to Know That The Puppet Organization Has Not Been Recognized by the Governments of Various Countries, Therefore, No Matter What Requests It Makes, The Municipal Council Authority Does Not Need to Respond to It, Let Alone Adopt Its Proposal; Moreover, The Establishment of The Court Is Based on Agreements Between the Governments of Various Countries and The Chinese Government, The Municipal Council Has No Right to Interfere With or Change Any Point of It, So Chuan's Illusion Finally Came to Nothing.

Criminal Cases are Dealt with as Usual; Yesterday Was The First Day of the Fourth Term of the Special Court Agreement; The Criminal Cases of Various Police Stations Under the Jurisdiction of the Municipal Council Are Still Sent to the Various Courts of the First Special Court for Trial as Usual; And in Order to Prevent Accidents, the Police Authorities of the Municipal Council Specially Instructed a Western Constable, a Chinese Constable, and Two Chinese Detectives to Be Stationed Outside the Gate of the Court, and All Men and Women Entering the Court Were Subjected to Strict Interrogation Before They Could Be Allowed to Enter the Court; And in Order to Assist in The Municipal Council's Vigilance, the British Scottish Defense Forces Stationed Inside the Court Also Instructed Fully Armed Soldiers to be Stationed Inside the Gate of the Court.

There are three hundred poor Jewish refugee children in this city, whose main food is milk, but their finances are tight and they will soon be unable to buy it, so they are raising funds for relief.

### Three Soldiers of the Isolated Battalion Disappear from the Jiaozhou Park Barracks; Xie Jinyuan and the Municipal Council Reportedly Investigating the Truth

The Four-Line Isolated Battalion stationed in Jiaozhou Park in this city has been residing for over a year, wasting away the time. Considering the ongoing arduousness of the war of resistance and the lack of ways to serve the country, they inevitably lament the return of unused potential. On the morning of March 31st, it was discovered that three soldiers from the Isolated Battalion had suddenly disappeared, their whereabouts unknown. Xie Jinyuan, the battalion adjutant, reportedly launched an investigation into the cause and sought to find the missing soldiers. At the same time, the White Russian guards stationed at the barracks also reported to the Municipal Council. Because the discipline within the Isolated Battalion has always been excellent, and the White Russian guards are vigilant, how the three soldiers disappeared and their destination are worthy of attention and study. Currently, the Municipal Council is jointly investigating the matter with Battalion Adjutant Xie and others, while maintaining silence externally and refraining from making any statements.

In addition, the Central Relief Commission is requested to allocate a portion of disaster relief bonds as special funds for aiding the fishermen.

### Ministry of Finance Cables Instructions to Banks: Procedures for Handling Overseas Remittances; Should Follow Bank of China Regulations to Benefit Remittance Policy; Establishment of Overseas Branches Must Be Approved in Advance

The Ministry of Finance notes that the remittances sent back to China by compatriots residing abroad are substantial each year. Because the remittance agencies overseas are inconsistent, it has not been possible to channel all foreign exchange to the government. In order to attract overseas remittances, regulations now stipulate that overseas banks should liaise with the Bank of China, and all exchange rates should be handled according to the regulations of the Bank of China. Special telegrams have been sent to the banking associations in various regions, as well as the Bank of China, Central Bank, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank, requiring them to comply. The procedures are as follows: (1) When establishing branches overseas, banks must follow established regulations and apply to the Ministry for approval in advance. (2) Before the implementation of these measures, banks that have been approved by the Ministry to establish branches overseas should liaise with the Bank of China when handling overseas remittances. All exchange rates should also comply with the regulations of the Bank of China and should not differ. (3) The overseas remittances handled by the banks should be sold to the Bank of China according to the original transaction documents. At the same time, the Bank of China will pay back in national currency, and the Bank of China will sell the case to the Central Bank to facilitate remittance policy. (4) If any bank is found to have violated the provisions of item 1, the Ministry will impose penalties. If it violates the provisions of items 2 and 3, the Ministry may order the branch to suspend business.

### At the Donation Platform of Sun Sun Department Store; Children with "Philanthropic Chapter" Badges Eagerly Purchase with All Their Savings; Despite Rain Yesterday, Visitors Came in Droves; Expected to Be Even More Enthusiastic Today

During this year's Children's Practicality Festival, Sun Sun Department Store on Nanjing Road is not only holding low-priced sales in various departments and special children's amusement activities at the Green Treasure Theater to celebrate, but also holding a campaign to aid refugee children. Starting yesterday, a donation platform was set up inside the department store, and the store is giving out "Philanthropic Chapter" badges. Anyone who donates 20 cents at the platform will receive one badge. Details were published in yesterday's newspaper. It is learned that despite the rain yesterday, people from all walks of life led their children to the donation platform at the department store to donate enthusiastically. Many innocent and lovely children were willing to donate all their usual candy money, which is truly admirable. It is expected that today, being Sunday, students from various schools will participate and donate even more after school. It is anticipated that children wearing "Philanthropic Chapter" badges will be visible everywhere on the streets.

### Another Trust Company Organized; Its Organizational Structure Is Similar to that of an Exchange

Since the Shanghai War, all industry exchanges have been ordered by the Ministry of Finance to suspend operations, and it has been more than a year since then. Although the exchanges have repeatedly sought to resume operations, they have been restricted by the environment and in order to prevent disruption of financial stability, so there is still no hope of reopening. Last month, Wang Suizhi, a broker at the Gold Exchange, intended to organize the "China-France Public Appraisal Exchange" under the name of a French merchant, dealing in gold standard, cotton yarn, miscellaneous grains, and securities. He applied for registration to the French Consulate General in Shanghai, but it was not approved. Recently, Wang Suizhi intends to reorganize a trust company in the name of rescuing unemployed exchange members. The content and nature of this company are no different from an exchange. An office has been established on the upper floor of the Sumitomo Bank on Jiujiang Road and has begun registering brokers, limited to 200 households. At the same time, he has also submitted an application for registration to the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, requesting approval to open for business. However, this matter seems to conflict with the laws and regulations of the Ministry of Finance, and the organization of the trust company, its capital, and whether it has other political functions should be investigated in detail. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance is now telegraphing Wang Suizhi, the founder, to go to Chongqing for questioning.

### Italian Liner Conte Verde Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow; Passengers Must Take Tenders to the New Customs Pier at 2 PM

It is learned that the Euro-Asia Express liner Conte Verde of the Italian Postal Shipping Company, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, encountered strong winds and dense fog when departing from Luzon on the 28th.

After arrival, it is scheduled to dock at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. Tenders will depart from the New Customs Pier at 12:00 noon and return passengers to the New Customs Pier at 2:00 PM.

### After Promulgation of Procedures for Transporting Prohibited Goods to Shanghai; Various Industries Agreed on Procedures; Before Certificate is Approved, Temporary Handling According to True Telegram Format

Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued a cable announcing the examination and approval procedures for transporting prohibited goods to Shanghai, the Ningbo-Wenzhou and Shanghai Chamber of Commerce have both received the Ministry's cable and issued it for compliance. Relevant industries have also discussed and decided on the procedures to be followed. However, before the certificate format is approved, temporary handling is requested according to the true telegram format. Details are as follows:

Joint Meeting of Relevant Industries: In view of the examination and approval procedures for transporting prohibited goods to Shanghai issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which stipulates that the emergency relief measures stipulated in the previous true telegram of the Ministry should be abolished, but the certificate should be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs for approval, a joint meeting was held yesterday to discuss and decide on the procedures to be followed for (1) guarantee, (2) application, (3) certification, (4) reporting, and (5) verification. Various forms will be drafted and printed separately for reporting. It was also decided to telegraph the Ministry of Economic Affairs to allow the temporary use of the certificate format stipulated in the true telegram for the sake of urgent telegrams before the certificate format is approved. Once a telegram reply is received, it can be handled accordingly.

Chamber of Commerce Requests Release of Goods: (1) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that ramie cloth is widely needed domestically. The goods transported from Wuhan to Shanghai have been detained in Ningbo for three days, and safety is a concern after a long time. At this time when sales are gradually moving, it is urgent to quickly supply the market. A telegram has been sent to the Ministry of Economic Affairs again, requesting prompt approval to instruct the Zhejiang Customs to release the goods. (2) The Sausage Industry Association stated that the Ningbo and Wenzhou customs prohibited the export of sausage casings, so a telegram was sent to the Ministries of Economy and Finance to instruct the customs to release them. It is reported that the Zhejiang Customs has received a Ministry order to allow the release after verifying compliance with the foreign exchange settlement procedures. (3) The Lacquer Industry Association previously stated that raw lacquer is a necessity for people's daily life, and telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs to request approval to adopt guarantee measures and instruct the Zhejiang Customs to release it. A reply telegram has been received from the Ministry approving the handling accordingly.

### As Climate Warms, Hotel Heating is Canceled; Increased Room Rates Canceled Simultaneously

The Hotel Industry Association of this city convened a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on the evening of the 27th of last month to discuss the increase of room rates by 15% to compensate for the large losses incurred due to the high price of coal when using heating in various hotels last winter. Now that the climate is warming and heating will be discontinued, the 15% increase should be canceled on a scheduled basis to maintain credibility. The meeting resolved to discontinue the use of heating in all hotels from April 16th and cancel the 15% surcharge at the same time to show good faith.

### Drug Trafficker Wang Tianxin Sentenced to Life Imprisonment; Concubine Shen Sentenced to Twelve Years; Set Up Organization in Qingdao Road Residence; Chinese and Western Detectives Confiscate Huge Quantities of Narcotics

Ye Yuxi, the Chinese detective chief of the Narcotics Division of the General Police Department, detectives Li Shugui, Liu Zhaonian, Guo Shouxin, Zhao Baosheng, and Western detective chief Hales and others, at 7:30 AM on the morning before yesterday, cracked a huge organization transporting and selling drugs at No. 33, Lane 45, Qingdao Road, arresting Wang Tianxin (alias Wang Guanhao, 40 years old) from Haimen, and his concubine Wang Shen (20 years old) from Nanxun. Four iron boxes of heroin were confiscated, totaling 124 taels,

Worth Tens of Thousands of Dollars, as well as 1,521 yuan in large and small legal tender, 15 packs of coffee essence, Chrysanthemum brand writing paper, seals, and iron cards were also confiscated and taken to the Xinzha Police Station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police prosecuted according to Article 4 and Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Drug Offenses for the crimes of selling and aiding. The defendants hired lawyer Wu Peng to defend them. The police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that on the afternoon of March 27, Chinese detective Li Shugui of the Narcotics Division learned that someone at No. 33, Lane 45, Qingdao Road,

Was Selling Drugs, so he immediately ordered an informant to purchase it with 5 yuan of legal tender. First, he went to No. 4 in the lane to contact the defendant Wang Tianxin, handed over the money, and instructed Wang Shen to pick up the goods at No. 33. The detectives then requested the court to issue a search warrant and went to No. 33 at 7:30 AM yesterday to carry out the search. The two defendants were arrested downstairs, and a foreign iron box was found in the cabinet, containing six large packages of heroin, totaling 78 taels. Another box contained 16 taels, the third box contained 15 packages, totaling 9 taels, and the fourth box contained envelopes and a large package of narcotics, totaling 21 taels, totaling 124 taels.

124 taels. There was also a foreign iron box containing 15 packs of coffee essence, which was used to mix into the narcotics. There was also a leather bag containing 720 yuan in 5-yuan and 10-yuan legal tender, 360 yuan in 1-yuan notes, 388 yuan in subsidiary currency, 10 yuan in nickel coins, and 200 double copper coins, totaling 1,521 yuan. There were also scales, three seals, account books, and writing paper, all of which were taken to the police station. According to Wang, this matter was a partnership between him and Gu Weichen, who is at large. Gu lived at No. 73 in the same lane. The narcotics were usually

Placed at Gu's House. Recently, because the French Concession cracked a narcotics case involving Gu's customers, Gu feared that the location would be leaked, so he moved the narcotics to the defendant's place. It was found that Wang had a wife who also lived at No. 4 in the same lane. Usually, they were all at No. 4 during the day, and at night, he and his concubine lived at No. 33. His sales place was inside No. 4. If a customer came to the door, Wang would hand the key to his concubine to pick up the goods at No. 33. The police went to No. 4 to search and found seven notebooks, but because his wife was mentally unstable, the police did not prosecute her. She is also in court today, listening, etc. When questioned, Wang Tianxin,

Gave Evasive Testimony, saying that Gu Weichen had deposited this item at his place a few days ago, which was transported from Tianjin, and the selling price was 2,100 yuan per 25 taels. Wang Shen testified that she met Wang Tianxin in October last year and had been helping to sell drugs. After arguments from both lawyers, Judge Xiao Peishen sentenced Wang Tianxin to life imprisonment for jointly selling drugs and depriving him of his civil rights for life. Wang Shen was sentenced to twelve years in prison and deprived of her civil rights for ten years. The narcotics and other items were confiscated as per the list.

### Dance Hostess Dies by Suicide After Overdose

Local woman Feng Yuwen, aged 18, resided at a certain address on Route Lafayette in the French Concession. She used to work as a dance hostess at the Great World and Paramount dance halls but had stopped dancing for some time. The night before last (31st), Feng checked into room 313 of the Shanghai New Hotel on Hubei Road alone. Before long, several male friends arrived to gamble and dine. It was a joyful occasion, but good times never last. Around 9:40 PM last night, two male friends, Liu Dawei and Zheng Qiangsheng, went to visit. They noticed that the door of the room was locked, so they asked the tea servant to open it and found Feng lying on the side of the bed, barely breathing, with a fixed gaze and a speechless mouth. They also found an empty bottle of some kind of drug on the table, indicating that she had taken poison. The tea servant reported to the receptionist, who ordered guard No. 1782 to accompany Liu and Zheng in a car to the Shizhong Hospital for treatment. However, due to the excessive overdose, the medicine was ineffective, and she died at 10:20 PM. According to Liu, Feng's suicide was initially due to the lack of freedom in marriage and the separation from her family for more than a year. Now, she had been promiscuous, leading to financial difficulties, and resorted to this plan.

### Woman Petitions for Support; Sues Father-in-Law for Mediation and Living Expenses; Both Parties Hold Different Views, Mediation Declared Unsuccessful

Local woman Xu Lu, 38 years old, represented by lawyer Zhu Taiqing, filed a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, against her father-in-law Xu Xieting (alias Xu Liusheng, residing at the Huasheng Bicycle Shop, No. 415, Huanlong Road,) requesting mediation and payment of support, etc. According to the petition, the petitioner is unable to maintain her livelihood and requests mediation and

an order for support. The petitioner married Mao Tou, the son of the defendant, on February 18, 1922. After Mao Tou died in September of the following year, the petitioner vowed to remain a widow and lived a hard life. The defendant initially showed compassion for the petitioner, but later, as younger uncles married and started families, the defendant's attitude towards the petitioner

Gradually Cooled. The petitioner was forced to go out to work on February 19, 1935, relying on employment to make a living. After being dismissed on January 29 of this year, she returned to the defendant's home but was refused entry. The petitioner is unfortunately widowed but is still a member of the Xu family. The defendant has vast assets and usually supports four sons, daughters-in-law, and grandchildren. He uniquely discriminates against and refuses entry to the petitioner, even raising

A Heart to Deceive the Widow and Expel the Widow. The petitioner is a woman and is really unable to maintain her daily life. She is forced to request mediation and an order for support, giving her a minimum of 15 yuan per month for living expenses, etc. Upon receiving the petition, the court, headed by Judge Sun Pengxian, convened a civil court yesterday morning and summoned both parties for mediation. Both parties arrived with lawyers. First, the petitioner stated the previous circumstances. The defendant, represented by lawyer Ge Zhitian, stated that after the defendant's son Mao Tou died, the petitioner

Returned to Her Mother's Home in Ningbo, and has not returned for fifteen years. Because she is young and unable to remain a widow, she could only let her leave. She had even married a Mr. Zhang in the middle. Now, she suddenly wants to return to her husband's house to live together and demand support, which is unreasonable, etc. The court verified the statements, and since both parties held different views, the mediation was declared unsuccessful. The petitioner was ordered to file a formal lawsuit.

### Accused of Adultery and Cohabitation, Appeal Declared Not Guilty

Fang Changsheng, a native of Shaoxing, 55 years old, resided at No. 69, McCarter Road, in the French Concession. He previously opened the Shunxingxiang Hotel in the old county town of Nanshi. After the war, he moved to Wangzhi Road. His wife, Chuan, 42 years old, was previously accused by her husband, Fang Changsheng, in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, of adultery and cohabitation with her cousin Mao Gensheng. Fang Chuan and Mao Gensheng were sentenced to four months in prison. The defendant Mao Gensheng did not accept the first-instance judgment and hired lawyer Pan Renxi to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court. His reason was that Fang Chuan was temporarily living at the appellant's place because of disagreements with her husband. On the day of the adultery arrest, the appellant and Chuan were not sleeping in the same bed. Furthermore, when the appellee testified in court, he said that the adulterer and adulteress were wearing underwear when they were caught in the act, and then said that they were naked, which was obviously inconsistent. Moreover, Fang Chuan is extremely ugly and no one would want to love her, etc. The appeal was granted, and the case was called. The appellees had no conclusive evidence to prove it. An order was issued to make a judgment on the scheduled date. Judge Wu Tingqi announced yesterday that the original judgment in this case was revoked, and the appellant Mao Gensheng was not guilty.

### A Magpie's Nest Coveted by a Cuckoo: Sister-in-Law Forces Sister-in-Law to Suicide - A Tragic Scene at the Far Eastern Hotel

At 2 PM the day before yesterday, a middle-aged woman went alone to the Far Eastern Hotel at the racecourse, reserved room number 508, and signed the name Li Wenjing. Unexpectedly, at 8 PM, tea servant number 48 discovered that the woman was groaning incessantly in the room. The door was forced open, and it was learned that she had taken Lysol solution to commit suicide. The accounting office was immediately notified, who in turn reported it to the police station. She was rushed to the hospital. Afterwards, a reporter from the Shewen News Agency learned that the female guest, surnamed Li, was actually Ge Yang Xueqin, from Beiping, age 40, and the wife of Wu Yihong, former inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. After the National Revolutionary Army withdrew westward from Shanghai, Wu moved to 171 Ximen Road in the French Concession. Last year, when Wu left Shanghai for Guangdong, because there was a lack of people to take care of the household, he brought his stepmother and younger sister-in-law Zai Ruisheng and his wife to live there, hoping they would help with the household. Unexpectedly, after Wu left Shanghai, Wang and others bullied her as a weak woman, constantly scolding and humiliating her. Later, they intensified their efforts, intending to drive her out and seize the house. Therefore, they often beat her at the slightest pretext. Because her sister-in-law not only showed no sympathy but also often spoke ill of her, her younger sister-in-law recently instigated her husband to beat and humiliate her again. She brought the matter to the police station, but it was treated as a family matter, and the police released both parties. Because her husband was far away in Guangdong, with no one to appeal to, she went to a room to commit suicide. Beforehand, she left two letters, one addressed to female lawyer Yu Xiufang and one to her husband, entrusting Yuan Xifan, who lived in Dongxin Bridge, to deliver them. The content of the letters detailed the abuse she had suffered, the language being extremely sorrowful and moving, and she asked lawyer Yu to seek justice for her.

### Lacquerer Throws Himself into the River and is Rescued

Yu Awen, a native of Ningbo, is 42 years old and works as a lacquerer. He is currently unemployed, leading to financial difficulties and making it difficult for him to support himself. He suddenly had thoughts of ending his life. Yesterday morning at 10 AM, he went alone to the area of the New Garbage Bridge on Yu Qiaqing Road and jumped into the river.

They ordered several boatmen in the Suzhou River to help with the rescue and managed to save him. An ambulance was called and he was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment.

### Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Letters

The Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Letters, initiated by Lin Kanghou, Zhou Bangjun, Xu Xiaochu, Qian Huafo, and other people from all walks of life, after a long period of preparation, is taking shape. It is scheduled to be held publicly at the Great New Company during the spring holidays. Admission is 20 cents per person, and all proceeds will be used to help refugees. A method for publicly soliciting items and a letter to students have also been announced, roughly stating: The content of this exhibition is to collect all kinds of letters and documents similar to letters that have been used, bring them together to form a grand view, and display them for exhibition. You can see a dazzling array of social documents that you have never heard of or seen before. We want to use this interesting thing to sell some tickets. The ticket money will be donated entirely to help refugees. According to our estimates, assuming that each person sells tickets for 20 cents, it is certainly an inexpensive matter for individuals, but given the large population of Shanghai, if the number of visitors can reach 100,000 or 200,000, the income will be 20,000 or 40,000, which will be a significant benefit to the refugees. However, to make the content of this exhibition substantial and the results satisfactory, it is necessary to collect extensively and comprehensively. This will have to rely on the greatest assistance from people from all walks of life. Please help promote and solicit items from parents, teachers, friends, relatives, and other aspects. The method for publicly soliciting items is attached below: (1) The scope of collection is tentatively set to include invitations, thank-you notes, greeting cards, business cards, inscriptions, obituaries, cards, micro-donations (micro-essays, micro-poems, micro-letters, micro-calligraphy), and other similar documents. (2) Ordinary collectibles will retain the donor's name once received. (3) For high-quality items and items that need to be returned, the association will issue a receipt upon receipt and return them based on the receipt after the exhibition is over. (4) For high-quality items or large numbers of items, the association can be notified in advance and will send someone to collect them in person. (5) Donors of precious items or large numbers of items will be issued certificates to commemorate them.

### How Children Can Implement Spiritual Mobilization

— Lu Guanliu

Since the central government formulated a plan and clearly ordered its implementation, the work of spiritual mobilization has now spread to all parts of the country and all levels of society, and everyone is enthusiastically implementing it. In today's severe national crisis, no national can stand idly by, so everyone should be invigorated and work hard to save the country. Children are the future masters of the country, so of course they are no exception. However, children are young and have limited abilities, so they are different from adults after all. Then, the methods, organization, and work of spiritual mobilization for children must also be different from those for adults.

Regarding the plan for children to implement spiritual mobilization, there is still a lack of concrete measures. Therefore, the author specifically raises several issues in this regard to discuss with everyone.

I. Regarding Organization

Group organization is the most important center of spiritual mobilization. Therefore, if we don't talk about spiritual mobilization, then so be it, but if we want to implement spiritual mobilization, there must be a strict organization. However, children are different from adults. They are not yet accustomed to group life, so children's organizations should be simple, not complex, and the organizational units should be small, not large, so that children can easily understand them, so as to give children the opportunity to implement work, develop automatic spirit, and express their ability to act.

The organization of children is best based on ten people as a basic unit, with one leader in each group, elected from within the group. Each group holds a regular meeting once a week, such as discussions and designs of various activities, election of staff, daily affairs, and other daily affairs, all of which are resolved by the small group meeting. Four or five groups are then combined into a small team (one small team is equal to one class), and each team elects a captain and has a team instructor, who is the class teacher. Each team holds an oath, discusses the implementation of rules, organizes group undertakings, and reviews work.

One school becomes a middle team, formed by the joint efforts of all small teams. Methods of contact between middle teams are then sought. This is regarding the organizational aspect.

II. Regarding the Oath

In the spiritual mobilization plan, there are twelve articles of the National Covenant, which every national swears to implement. The covenant is the guiding principle of action, and the oath is a symbolic method. This approach is sufficient to stimulate the children's enthusiastic patriotic spirit, so it is of course feasible. However, the National Covenant is inclined to be passive, and most of the provisions are not in line with the actual lives of children, so it is proposed to revise them into the following items:

Patriotic Covenant

(1) I believe in the Three Principles of the People. (2) I love the Republic of China. (3) I want to be a model child.

Spiritual Oath

We each, in good conscience, swear to abide by the Patriotic Covenant, absolutely support the National Government, obey the leadership of Chairman Chiang, and do our best to serve the country. If there is any breach of oath, we are willing to be severely punished. ××××× solemnly swears.

III. Regarding Work

Some people think that spiritual mobilization is limited to taking the oath, which is really a mistake. The purpose of spiritual mobilization is to invigorate the spirit and implement mobilization. This is to ask us to say less enthusiastic empty words and do more practical work. Therefore, in addition to taking the oath and organizing, there should also be appropriate work for them to do. Although children's abilities are small, they can also do small things. What many things can they do? Here is a list:

(1) Promote the literacy movement. (2) Promote economy and disaster relief. (3) Organize learning groups. (4) Participate in academic competitions. (5) Conduct current affairs broadcasts. (6) Publish children's wall newspapers, etc.

In short, all work that is sufficient to promote patriotic ideas and implement collective life can be planned and implemented for them. The spiritual mobilization of children is a preparation for future citizens. Chinese citizens should use the power of unity to resist aggression and revive China. This should be learned from childhood!

### The History of Children's Day

— Shuzhai

Dear children! What day is today? I think you will answer quickly: "Today is Children's Day, the happiest day for children!"

That's right, not wrong at all, but have you ever known its history? If you don't know, I can tell you:

The term "Children's Day" originated in foreign countries. For example, Children's Day in the United Kingdom is on July 14th, and Children's Day in Japan is divided into two days for boys and girls. Boys' Day is on May 5th, and Girls' Day is on March 3rd. Other countries like the United States, France, Germany, and the Soviet Union also have Children's Day. No matter which country, on Children's Day, children wear new clothes, eat candy, take toys, and play happily. In the United Kingdom and France, on this day, celebrations are held for children all over the country, performing entertainment, giving speeches, and opening parks. In the United States, on this day, the White House is specially opened to allow children to enter and play freely, and the President shakes hands with every child, and also gives a bag of candy and a book to every child.

As for our China? We also recognize that children are the masters of the future, so in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Ciyou Association petitioned the National Government to set the festival on April 4th. After the government approved it, from that year onwards, every April 4th, elementary schools across the country would suspend classes for one day, allowing children to play as much as possible.

Children! Do you know the meaning of Children's Day? The meaning of Children's Day can be said from two aspects: on the one hand, it is to awaken children all over the country to reflect on themselves, to be able to study hard and exercise their bodies, and on the other hand, it is to make people all over the country pay attention to children, so that they become good citizens of the future. This is how much they value children and how much they expect from children!

### Several Model Children

— Wei Xiang

China is roaring, and China's children are also roaring.

The eight-and-twenty months of war have united the Chinese nation as strongly as steel. Everyone, under the leadership of the supreme leader, is marching on the great road of "resistance and national reconstruction." At the same time, the eight-and-twenty months of war have trained Chinese children to be as brave as lions, as agile as monkeys, and as enduring as camels. The children of the new China are no longer dependent family members, but have become small soldiers serving society and dedicating themselves to the country.

Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, children in various places have enthusiastically engaged in various patriotic activities centered around children, such as saving, donating money, providing first aid, collecting scrap metal, promoting conscription, and acting as "little teachers." Some have even participated in the war, staging heroic stories and adding much brilliance to the history of the war of resistance.

The following are stories of several model children during the war.

1.  Yang Huimin, the Girl Scout who presented a flag to the Four Hundred Lone Soldiers! Yang Huimin is a brave Girl Scout. At the end of October of the previous year, when our army retreated from the Shanghai area, four hundred brave soldiers remained in the Four Banks Warehouse on the banks of the Suzhou River, vowing to fight to the last drop of blood to exact the price due from the invaders. Yang Huimin braved all dangers and sent a national flag into the warehouse, presenting it to the loyal and courageous Four Hundred Lone Soldiers. In the last position in Zhabei, surrounded by Japanese flags amidst the smoke, the bright and dazzling national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth was hoisted above our Four Banks Warehouse, indicating that our army was still holding Zhabei and promoting our great Chinese spirit!

2.  A Boy Scout on Avenue Edward VII - On a certain day after the "August 13th" battle began, a crowd on Avenue Edward VII in Shanghai surrounded and beat up a "traitor." This happened to be seen by a lone Boy Scout, who immediately broke into the crowd and embraced the "traitor," stopping the beating. The "traitor" was taken to the police station by the Boy Scout. After investigation, it was found that there were no criminal charges and that he was not a traitor, so he was not injured. The person and his family were so grateful to the Boy Scout for saving him from danger that they considered him their savior.

3.  Shoe-Shining Boy Wu Weisou - Wu Weisou was a shoe-shining boy in Guangzhou. When Guangzhou held a donation campaign, he shined shoes for donors and audiences in front of the donation platform all day long, handing over the proceeds to the platform at any time. He shined shoes a total of one hundred and eighty-five times, earning more than twenty yuan in total. Each time he donated, he received a donation certificate. By evening, his clothes were covered with donation certificates.

4.  Fourth Kang Elementary School Students Knock Tiles to Donate Money - Outside the city of Huali County in Xikang, a road was being built. All the elementary school students of the Fourth Junior Group of the local elementary school went to knock tiles for the adults, earning a total of sixteen yuan in remuneration. They sent the money to the Executive Yuan of the National Government as a donation to save the country, and attached a letter of comfort to the soldiers at the front.

5.  Pan Bizheng, Who Fasted to Persuade His Father - Pan Bizheng was a seventeen-year-old Guangdong youth. His father was a wealthy man. After the fall of Guangzhou, Pan Bizheng was very sad and indignant. He asked his father to transfer the deposits in foreign banks to national banks, and donate four million yuan to the government. When his father refused, he went on a hunger strike to promote his father's awareness. Later, Pan Bizheng finally achieved his goal of saving the country.

6.  Ma Shu, Who Serves as a Medic at the Front - Ma Shu is the captain of the Fourth Directly Subordinate Detachment of the First Wartime Service Regiment of the China Boy Scouts. He led forty members and served on the front line, experiencing countless hardships and dangers. During the fierce battle of Majingling in Jiangxi, they braved enemy poison gas, ate only taro every day, and still bravely carried out their work of pulling and rescuing wounded soldiers. (During this war of resistance, the Boy Scouts of our country served the country and made great contributions. Mr. Ma Shu, mentioned above, is only one example. According to the China Boy Scout Association, since the outbreak of the war, 350,000 Chinese Boy Scouts have served on the front lines or in the rear, and 10,000 of them have assisted in combat on the front lines.)

Children's Weekly Children's Day Special

### How to Commemorate Children's Day During the War of Resistance

— Jin Zhen

The Children's Day of April 4th, 28th year of the Republic of China, is coming soon, and especially during the War of Resistance, this Children's Day is even more valuable. Children, you are the central figures of Children's Day, how should you commemorate it?

Recently, newspapers have published that various groups are preparing to celebrate, which can also be said to be congratulating you. Aren't you a little worried? Why are they celebrating like this? What exactly do we have to celebrate?

Children, don't underestimate yourselves. You must know that thousands of loyal and brave soldiers have sacrificed themselves for the country in the war, and cities everywhere have been destroyed by artillery fire and bombs, but the final victory undoubtedly belongs to us. But who will bear the important responsibility for post-destruction construction? I can say with certainty that it is on the shoulders of each of you, so the annual commemoration of this Children's Day is to hope that you will become the pillars of the country's future and good citizens. Therefore, during the War of Resistance, we should celebrate even more enthusiastically.

Dear children, they have such earnest expectations, so how should we ensure that they are not disappointed? It is not enough to just hold a celebration meeting, raise a flag, and shout slogans. Everyone should examine themselves from the inside out to see if they are qualified to be good citizens of the future, that is, whether they are worthy of being modern children now? Therefore, I hope you will examine the following three points. If everyone meets these three standards, I can guarantee that your future will be bright and brilliant.

(1) Morality: This refers to daily actions. How do you treat people in school? How do you treat your parents at home? How do you treat your siblings? Are there any acts of deception? Are there any rude actions?

(2) Intelligence: Are we studying hard? Are we lazy? Or diligent? Do we read the newspaper every day? Has our knowledge been enriched?

(3) Physique: How is our health? Because physical health is closely related to a person's success or failure in their career. Otherwise, even with rich knowledge, without a strong physique, one is still a useless person. We should get up early in the morning to exercise our bodies and breathe fresh air.

Children, while you are happily celebrating Children's Day, please do not forget these three simple points, and I wish you "unlimited prospects"! I am ashamed to consider it a gift for this year's Children's Day.

### Standards of Children's Health

— Ding Huikang

Children are the future masters of the country. Every child has a future responsibility to the family, society, and country. Children's health is the most important foundation for taking on future responsibilities.

Children's health is not only a foundation needed for children to take on future responsibilities, but also a foundation for enjoying all happiness.

What are the standards of children's health? That is, the organs of children must be healthy in order to be considered standard health. Now, due to space limitations, I will only select a few important relationships to talk about.

1.  Strong Skin Children should have strong skin. Washing their faces and bodies with cold water can develop a habit of cold resistance and reduce the chance of catching a cold.

2.  Good Eyesight Children should have good eyesight. Pay attention to using their eyesight and avoid becoming nearsighted. Because I recently learned that a Mr. Li had a very good physique, passed everything, but could not be admitted to aviation school due to nearsightedness.

3.  Healthy Teeth Children should have healthy teeth, because teeth are a sharp tool for chewing food. They are used every day. If there is a disease, not only will chewing be inconvenient, but it will also be very painful. Therefore, children should develop the habit of brushing their teeth as early as possible.

4.  Healthy Lungs Children should have healthy lungs, because the lungs can absorb air, and we cannot survive without air. Therefore, the lungs are one of the most important organs in the human body and must be kept healthy.

The above are all related to the health of the whole body. As for children's need for whole body health, fresh air, nutritious food, appropriate exercise, and diligent bathing should of course be paid great attention to, because these are the genes that create a healthy body. In addition, there is one very important thing, that is, to travel for various health examinations in preventive medicine once a year, because on the one hand, you can know the exact health status of children, and on the other hand, you can detect whether there are various diseases invading and lurking. With the high mortality rate of children in our country, this kind of preventive examination is of great significance. Also, based on the author's more than ten years of clinical experience, knowing that there are many tuberculosis patients in our country, this kind of preventive examination, especially for children's lung X-ray examination, is even more important in protecting children's happiness and preventing tuberculosis.

### Spelling Game

— Shen Baiying

Hello, children, the day after tomorrow is Children's Day. I don't know what to say, so let's take this opportunity to play a "spelling game"!

First of all, which word among many words has the simplest strokes? Everyone knows that it is the one-stroke word "一" (one). When you see the word "一" (one), you should think of what the ancients said: "A day's plan is in the morning, a year's plan is in the spring, and a lifetime's plan is in diligence." You are at the beginning of your life, now is the beginning of the year, and now is the time to read the newspaper in the morning. You should use your brains and think carefully: What are you planning to do today? What knowledge are you planning to seek this year? What kind of person are you planning to become in the future? Take advantage of this great time and immediately put some effort into the word "diligence."

Adding a vertical stroke to the word "一" (one) forms the word "十" (ten). The word "十" (ten) is a special symbol of the Red Cross and Christianity. They both take benevolence, kindness, and saving the world as their purpose. When we see this word "十" (ten), we should determine our belief in serving the public and stir up our will to save the masses. Seeing refugees suffering from hunger and cold, children who cannot afford to go to school, compatriots suffering from illness, and soldiers injured for the country, we should do our best to help them as much as possible.

Adding a left-falling stroke to the word "十" (ten) forms the word "才" (talent). Smart people are called geniuses, stupid people are called idiots, and ordinary people are called mediocrities. Everyone likes to be a genius and dislikes being an idiot. But in the world, there are very few geniuses, and there are many mediocre and stupid people. What is the reason for this? It turns out that most geniuses are often unwilling to work hard and give up on themselves, and as a result, they become mediocre or stupid. Most mediocre and stupid people are also unwilling to work hard and never have a chance to stand out in their lives. Now I advise you smart people not to be arrogant, and you not-so-smart people not to be discouraged. To tell if the future will be good or not, depends entirely on your efforts and not your efforts now. Children with aspirations, move forward!

Adding a falling stroke to the word "才" (talent) forms the word "木" (wood). An ancient saying says: "It takes ten years to grow trees, but a hundred years to cultivate people." In the past, people regarded a person as a tree. This saying is very meaningful. When trees are small, they grow straight, and when they grow up, they can become useful materials; if they grow crooked from a young age, they will never be of great use when they grow up. A person who takes the right path from childhood will definitely be a good child at home, a good student at school, and a good citizen in society. The relationship between childhood and a lifetime is so important!

Adding a stroke to the word "木" (wood) forms the word "本" (root). The foundation of a country is the people, the foundation of the people is the children, and the foundation of the children is what I said above, which lies in establishing a foothold to be a useful person. A useful person is not only able to read a few dead books and recognize a few words. It includes exercising physical health, improving habits and character, and increasing experience and skills. If a person wants to contribute to the country, in childhood, he should work hard in all aspects from the root, so that there is hope of success.

I have said too much. I want to speed up and finish early. Add a few more strokes to the word "本" (root), add a bamboo radical to form the word "笨" (stupid). The many tasks that I mentioned above "一" (one), "十" (ten), "才" (talent), "木" (wood), "本" (root) should be done. If you are unwilling to do them seriously and only want to take shortcuts and be greedy for cheap, then you are simply a fool. The top of the word "笨" (stupid) is the same as the top of the word "笑" (laugh). If a person becomes a fool, he will be laughed at; how embarrassing it is to be laughed at!

Children's Day is here, children, take this opportunity to reflect on yourselves and work hard together in the direction of the great era!

Poor B: I heard that children don't have to pay for movies today.

Poor A: You don't have to pay to visit the park today either.

Poor B: Let's go out and play!

Poor C: Watching movies and visiting parks all require tickets; alas! Where do we get to play! (At this time, the national flag is hung up, the water is boiled, and poured into the pot.)

Poor D: The national flag is hung up, everyone, come and bow!

Poor C: Bow to what!

Poor D: Whoever doesn't salute the Blue Sky, White Sun Flag is not a Chinese child, I'll give them a punch! (Everyone puts down their work, tidies up their clothes, and lines up in front of the national flag.)

Poor D: Bow! One bow, two bows, three bows!

Offstage: Newspaper Boy: Just published, the Children's Day special, the Shen Bao Children's Day special! (The sound gets closer.)

(Two newsboys, carrying newspaper bags, enter.)

Newsboy A: Business is great this morning! One hundred Shen Bao newspapers, sold out in a while. (Hands the newspaper money to Newsboy B, takes out a pancake from the newspaper bag, and shares it with the children.)

(Newsboy B calculates the money from selling newspapers, and the children eat pancakes while watching Newsboy B count the money)

Newsboy A: (Pours a cup of water and drinks it himself.) What's wrong? Wang Amei (toy-selling girl) hasn't come back yet!

Newsboy B: I ran into her once, and her kites haven't sold out yet. (The girl enters)

Girl: I'm back. (Hangs the basket on the wall.)

Newsboy A: Eat a pancake!

Girl: (Eating a pancake) I saw many people taking things to the refugee camp.

Poor C: The people in the refugee camp are so comfortable! They have food and sleep.

Newsboy B: You rice bucket! You only think about eating, not about working.

(The neighbor's old lady enters, carrying candy.)

Old Lady: Come here! Here are a few bags of candy, take them and eat them!

Children: (Bowing) Good morning, old lady!

Girl: (Accepting the candy) Thank you, old lady, for giving us candy to eat.

Old Lady: It's a pity you are all children without mothers or fathers, who will take care of you!

Children: It's okay! We can take care of each other ourselves.

Old Lady: Today is Children's Day, go out and play! Don't work anymore! (The old lady exits.)

Children: Goodbye, old lady!

(Each child takes a bag of candy and puts a piece in their mouth.)

Girl: The old lady is so kind! She often comes to see us.

Children: (Eating candy) Delicious! Sweet! (Elementary school students enter.)

Student A: Today is Children's Day, we came to give you some gifts.

Student B: Our gift is a book. (Carrying a bag of books).

Student C: (Picks up a book) This book is called Friends of Children. (Hands out one to each person, and the children look at the books.)

Poor C: I can't read, what's good to do?

Newsboy B: You are a little rice bucket.

Poor D: If you don't read, you are not allowed to eat.

Student D: We will teach you to read; and teach you how to write, and how to be a good person.

Poor A: Good, good; class will start this afternoon.

Student E: We also have a gift for you. (Takes out Children's Day commemorative badges and pins them on the children's clothes.)

Student A: Look! There are six words on this badge: "Children Help Children" which means, we help you, and you help us.

Student C: We help you by teaching you to read, teaching you to write, and teaching you how to be a good person.

Poor D: We should also help you!

Newsboys: We deliver newspapers to you every morning.

Poor A: We make toys for you to play with.

Students: Okay! We help each other, we hold hands!

All: Let's sing. (Sing the Children's Day song)

(After singing, the curtain closes)

### Celebrating Children's Day

— Si Qiu

April 4th, the spring breeze blows,

The country is broken, the family is destroyed,

Only a small heart will never turn gray.

Saving materials during national crisis,

Don't dislike individual strength as weak!

See you on this day next year,

Pre-wishing all lost lands to be recovered.

All new construction,

All depends on our generation.

April 4th, all flowers bloom,

Brave men's blood is shed on the front line.

Scenery changes, personnel changes,

Only a small heart will never change.

Spiritual mobilization is strong,

Success is not afraid of prior failure.

Wait until this day next year, the final victory will surely come.

All new hopes,

All in our generation.

### Things That Should Be Done on Children's Day

— Zhou Kangguo, a Fifth Grade Student at Qianchaozong Elementary School

Time flies like flowing water, and in the blink of an eye, that lovely Children's Day has come again. In previous years, whenever Children's Day came, we always celebrated happily, having a potluck or a fun fair at school. But this year is not the case: this year, because we are in an extraordinary time, the country is in crisis, and the soldiers at the front are fighting bloody battles, so we children in the rear should change the old practices of previous years on this year's Children's Day and implement the following items:

(1) On that day, invite classmates and friends to visit the children in the refugee camp together. At the same time, save the money from this year's potluck, buy some candy, and distribute it to them, so that the refugee children can also have Children's Day.

(2) On that day, use the pocket money saved on weekdays to carry out the Children's Day donation campaign.

Children! If you think the above two points can be implemented. Then please implement it on Children's Day!

### Children's Day Reflections

— Wang Qiang, a Third Grade Student at Qilu Elementary School

Children's Day on April 4th is the happiest and most joyful day of the year for us children. Look: the gentle breeze, the warbling birds, the flowers and grass everywhere, how beautiful! Lovely spring, is this a gift you give us children?

In the past, when the lovely Children's Day arrived, my father would always buy some novel toys or beautiful books for us, but this year is completely different! My father lost his job, my family was destroyed by artillery fire! The area where we live has also fallen! The loving smiles of my parents are rarely seen! Toys and books are of course out of the question!

Ah! When will the darkness be driven away, and when will the light come!

### Children's Day Commemorating the Martyrs

— Pan Shijiong, a Sixth Grade Student at Qingnian Elementary School

I, I am too young to carry a gun, cannot walk or road, cannot go to the battlefield to fight; I can only live in Shanghai. My teacher said to me: Reading is also a kind of saving the country. After hearing this sentence, I worked harder than before! However, when I think of the self-sacrificing spirit of the soldiers at the front! I often feel very sad in my heart, why can't I do this?

Since the full-scale War of Resistance broke out, the tragic and heroic stories of the martyrs in various places have made the deepest impression on us children! We want to commemorate you, commemorate your heads and blue blood, which will lead to a paradise of freedom and equality, and give all our children across the country full of joy!

Although we are children, we also understand our responsibilities very well! When China is victorious, we will be workers in national construction. At this time, we must strive to acquire practical knowledge, learn the skills we can do, and learn from the spirit of the martyrs, be unyielding, and move forward!

I firmly believe that China has hope! Children can really save the country! If the martyrs have spirits, they must smile in the ground when they see China's final victory!

### Happy Children

— Zheng Boren, Sixth Grade Student of Fuchun Elementary School

Children's Day is a memorial day for all children. Its significance is: on the one hand, it enables parents and elder siblings to seek happiness for children; on the other hand, it arouses children's awareness of their own greatness; and on the other hand, it is to cultivate children's spirit of unity. The joy of Children's Day should be universal to all children in the country, regardless of poverty or wealth.

I believe this year's Children's Day has special significance. The children who have participated in celebrations in the past may be suffering. Just look at the children displaced by disasters on the streets and in the alleys. They lack even food and clothing, and some have even lost their parents. How can they talk about celebrating Children's Day? How can they enjoy the joy of Children's Day? The children who are able to participate in celebrating Children's Day today all have food to eat, clothes to wear, houses to live in, and books to read. They are even able to celebrate Children's Day happily today. They are children with happiness on top of happiness.

Children, our responsibility is too great! We should work hard to take on our responsibility and be the pioneers of national rejuvenation! If we want to evade or decline, then we are not worthy of being the little heroes of the Republic of China.

Children! Work hard! Step onto our bright and great road!

### Little Orator Mr. Xi Qingheng's Small Image

Mr. Xi is the son of Mr. Xi Yushu, a famous accountant in Shanghai and honorary treasurer of the Refugee Relief Association. He is only eleven years old. He recently gave a broadcast speech at the New-Sino Radio Station, the topic of which was to solicit funds for the production and education of refugees. His earnestness and eloquence moved the listeners, who praised him as a little orator.

### Children's Day for Child Refugees

— Bo Chui

On the ground covered with grass, Hua, like a dead snake, slept soundly. He was having a nightmare about escaping from disaster—"...Everyone squeezed through a crowded wooden bridge. Her brother, who was not yet one year old, was held in her mother's arms. Somehow, she glimpsed a red package falling straight into the river, making a 'thump' sound. Then her mother screamed, 'Ah...'

"A flash of fire in the distance, followed by a loud 'Boom!' The ground shook, and she couldn't stand still, as if someone had knocked her to the ground. When her mother came to help her up, she also fell on her. Several small pieces of iron hit her leg heavily, making it hurt so much that she couldn't stand up. Mud also pressed on her body, and her head and face were splattered with it...

"'Woo woo woo,' the ointment plane came, and she and her parents, along with many strangers, swarmed into the bamboo forest. 'Woo woo woo,' the plane got closer and closer, circling in the sky above the bamboo forest for a while. Everyone was so scared that they just trembled, their faces pale. The plane flew low, and the sound was so loud. The women were all so scared that they fell to the ground, and the men also covered their faces and held their heads, hiding everywhere. Suddenly, the bamboo forest crackled, as if it were hailing, rustling as it passed through the bamboo leaves. Only the sounds of 'Ah! ' 'Ah!' were heard several times, but the plane kept flying above the bamboo forest, and no one dared to move, only shrinking their bodies tighter. After a while, the plane flew away, and everyone looked up and shouted 'Ah!' again. Many refugees had been killed. Hua saw that her father's face was covered with blood, his eyes were closed, and his mouth was open... Her mother cried...

"She and her mother were in a heavy thunderstorm. They ran all night, with no place to hide. The thunder, rain, artillery fire, gunfire, and airplane sounds were all mixed together. They couldn't tell east from west and followed some people aimlessly, running so tired, running until dawn...

"Arriving in Shanghai, they passed through barbed wire...

"Arriving at the refugee shelter... eating two meals a day, drinking a bowl of thin porridge each meal..."

"One day when the wind was very strong, her mother had a fever, her face and neck were red with heat, like burning fire. She accompanied her by her side. Her mother muttered vague words, 'Hua's father... Ah Niu! ...The cloth in the back room... Rice! Beans! ...House! Fire... Poor little thing! ...' One day, two days, three days, she accompanied her mother. Her mother sometimes smiled, but sometimes she cried. She didn't know what to do! The men and women sitting next to her looked at her mother, shook their heads, and sighed... On the fourth night, she was so tired that she had to sleep. She slept, slept, fell asleep. When she woke up the next day, her mother was no longer lying beside her. People told her, 'Your mother died last night! The body has been taken away!' She cried when she heard that." (To be continued)

### Children's Day Notes

— Written by Ci Kai

### Fifteen-Year-Old Wu Bixi

### A Tour of the New-Sino Bazaar

— Xing Zi

April 4th is the eighth Children's Day. Children are the future masters of the country. During this time of all-out resistance against Japan, children's issues deserve our special attention. Although the people of Shanghai are trapped on an isolated island, they will never forget this particularly memorable festival. All parties have been preparing to celebrate it for some time, on the one hand, urging wise parents to pay attention to their children's education and hygiene, and at the same time, engaging in relief for children in distress. This is everyone's responsibility, and everyone should do their part. Mr. Li Ze, the general manager of the New-Sino Company, has always been enthusiastic about social undertakings. This time, in order to celebrate Children's Day, he specially reduced the prices of all items for four days, starting from April 1st, to give preferential treatment to beloved children. At the same time, for the sake of relieving child refugees, he also set up a donation table for child refugee relief. A donation of twenty cents will get a medal of philanthropy from the Shen Bao. This spirit of benevolence is truly admirable.

Yesterday (the 1st), although it was raining in the spring, the bazaar of the New-Sino Company was still crowded with people. I watched other people's lively and lovely children innocently asking their parents for this and that, and I couldn't help but feel a little envious.

The donation table in the center of the bazaar first attracted my attention. The table was decorated with pictures depicting the plight of disaster-stricken children. Above were four large red characters: "Relieve Child Refugees," and another line of smaller characters: "Donate twenty cents and receive a medal of philanthropy." The table was also decorated with the large medals of philanthropy donated by the Shen Bao. A girl in a red wool sweater sat behind the counter, smiling and accepting donations from enthusiastic people, and readily giving them a medal of philanthropy donated by the Shen Bao. There were old and young, men and women, and many children who happily took out money to exchange for a medal of philanthropy, which they wore on their bodies, looking very proud. Naturally, these children all grew up in wealthy families, but they did not forget that in another corner, there were still many children suffering. Therefore, they opened their wallets to donate.

Downstairs, stationery, sweets, children's clothing, socks, toothbrushes, water bottles, and other supplies, as well as clothing materials and shoes on the second floor, all goods related to children were sold at specially reduced prices.

The toy department and the radio department on the third floor were decorated in a unique way. The top was interwoven with red, blue, and white colored paper strips, symbolizing the blue sky, white sun, and red earth. In the center of the four counters were arranged moving lions, tigers, elephants, and Santa Claus, lifelike. Especially the lion, standing majestically with the party flag and the national flag crossed above it, with the words "Awakened Lion" inscribed beside it, attracted the attention of many people and also moved everyone. There were also toys specially manufactured by various factories, sold at special discounts. Foreign dolls, dogs and cats, rabbits, were displayed in rows, as well as airplanes and cannons, which were too many to see. This is the world of children, and every child smiled and chose their favorite toys.

The New-Sino's Children's Day celebration is scheduled for four days. In addition to the discounted goods, there are also entertainment programs and raffles. I believe that every child will linger and be reluctant to leave the New-Sino Company.

### Short News

The Shanghai Eighth Children's Day Celebration Preparatory Committee has been preparing for many days and is now ready.

Overview of the Shanghai Pediatric Sanatorium Visit. The Shanghai Pediatric Sanatorium, organized by doctors Lu Yihou, Fa Wang, and Shao Shi, officially opened yesterday. The hospital is located at No. 438 Julai Road in the French Concession, covering an area of ​​seven or eight acres, with a large garden, fresh air, and plenty of sunshine, which is very suitable for medical treatment and recuperation. The facilities in the hospital are all that a modern hospital should have, such as a new type of X-ray machine, short-wave diathermy machine, ultraviolet light, and various latest electrotherapy equipment, which are almost complete. As for the wards, they are especially spacious, and the furnishings are extremely clean. The management is particularly strict.

Spring and Autumn

### Surplus of Women

— (Xue Xue)

According to a United Press dispatch from Berlin on March 29: "Berlin, like the world's major capitals, is urgently in need of solving the 'woman problem.' The most difficult thing here is that there are too many women. The German authorities are now trying to equalize the number of men and women here. However, all methods have failed..."

Originally, the problem that capitalist society hates most is this problem of "surplus." For example, the problem of "overproduction" causes the accumulation of goods in society, the sharp drop in prices, the closure of factories, or the contraction of factories, and the increase in unemployment, etc. It can even affect credit and cause a "credit panic." So: banks went bankrupt, cash was in short supply, and stocks and bonds plummeted! Affecting agriculture, a "agricultural panic" occurred, and then: agricultural products fell in price and the agricultural economy went bankrupt! Affecting finance, a "financial panic" occurred, and then: even budgeting was insufficient: "Surplus" really brought capitalist society to a dead end. Although "production restrictions" or "reduced labor" can be used to deal with the "panic" a little, but unfortunately "panic" has a "cycle law" and is becoming more and more fierce.

Now the Nazi country has produced a "new panic," that is, the "surplus of women." A surplus of women means "too many women." According to those who like to marry concubines, this phenomenon of "surplus of women" is really a great opportunity to marry concubines. I believe that there may not be such people in Nazi countries, but their number accounts for a small minority! Therefore, this "women's problem" of "surplus of women" still cannot be solved!

"Panic" is produced by "surplus." The solution to "panic" in the "production" aspect is "production restriction" or "reduced labor." In my opinion, these two laws can also be moved to solve the "women's problem" of "surplus of women." "Production restriction" does not mean "no production," it means "restricting the production" of girls and specializing in "producing" boys. You only need to look at the United Press dispatch from Berlin to know: "In recent years, the number of boys produced in Germany has been 5% or 6% more than girls." This is the "hard work" that the Nazi rulers have put in to "surplus of women"! As for "reduced labor," it is equivalent to "rewarding childbirth," because those who think about "producing children" are all "friends who are full of warmth and think about adultery." This point has also been achieved by the Nazi countries, because the number of unemployed people in the current Nazi countries is indeed quite large, and "rewarding childbirth" has been implemented not only by the fascist friends, but also by the Nazis themselves. The country has been mobilized, and everything has been placed in a "wartime state." Intensifying the production of "cannon fodder" seems to be a kind of loyalty to the Nazis. The unemployed can raise a son and get a bonus, and they can also get by. This is really a win-win situation. However, since butter has been replaced by cannons, children die due to malnutrition, but, who cares? In any case, they have raised a son, received a bonus, and have also been loyal!

The reason for the "surplus of women" is said to be: "Officials believe that during the European War, a large number of men died in battle or were transferred to other places to engage in military service, so the number of women is relatively higher than that of men." This is a "big problem" because "fascism is war," but fortunately, the United Kingdom and France are helping, because "bloodless war" will not have cannon fodder, so the problem seems to be solved! From now on, as long as more boys are produced, "surplus of women" will not become a "problem," right?

However, war always sheds blood, and bloodlessness is only a temporary convenience. What will be good?

### "General Review"?

— Wu Renzhi

Thoughts on reading "The Low Tide of Shanghai Drama Movement"

"Low tide" and "high tide" are relative. If you compare the Shanghai drama movement with the inland drama movement, it may not be "high" enough in stimulation. However, the criticisms from the inland will compare the drama on the isolated island with the broad and firm public opinion that has been struggled for and the influential news business, and give awards and encouragements. Naturally, the dramatists on the isolated island have never been complacent about this. If we compare the current Shanghai drama movement with the past, then the Shanghai Drama Society alone had nine plays and 44 performances in eight months, creating the highest record of Chinese non-professional amateur theater groups. And in terms of "performance results," even Mr. Lu Wang said that there had been "good harvests." As for the work of "Star Small," there have been 35 one-act plays in performance alone, which has made Mr. Lu Wang say that "it cannot be said that it is a fairly full harvest." And the merits of the development of the drama movement and the role of the ring and wings of inland drama, Mr. Lu Wang has not calculated in it, (in fact, it is not the business of Mr. Lu Wang, who looks at other people's windows and doors with his own windows and doors closed.) He only said that "naturally it also has its objective social roots." Just talking about these, it cannot be said that it is "low." This is talking about the phenomenon of the drama movement. If Mr. Lu Wang is talking about the "leadership lake?" of the Shanghai drama movement, strutting, condescending, and talking loudly about the so-called "political leadership errors" and "leadership route errors," the height of this "trend," then I dare not say much, because I have also seen one or two books saying that the low tide and high tide of any movement are caused by the combination of objective environment and subjective efforts. Ignoring objective conditions and denying the subjective forces that are working hard, and arguing hard about the high or low of the tide or subjectively and biasedly evaluating high and low, what is suffered is either childhood disease or blindness and blind movement. On the contrary, if you misjudge both objective existence and subjective efforts and make excessive demands, the result will inevitably be the burial or liquidation of this movement.

"Theoreticians" and "Practitioners"

Here, there is no so-called "theoretician" who does not do "practitioner." Now there are so few dramatists left on the isolated island. Even if you want to talk about "closed-doorism," even if you want to talk about "sectarianism," even if you don't want to talk about "unity and unity," can it be done? The "practitioners" will feel that this is impossible. Therefore, in fact, even a nameless little soldier like me has been recruited unconditionally. Naturally, I know that the only condition is that I have to work hard. The conditions for performance are so difficult now, the repertoire is barren, and the censorship is strict. In the absence of basic economy and fixed venues, the decision to strive for performance (naturally, there is an absolute condition that it does not contain toxins) was carefully put forward by the "practitioners." Some take on the task of improving the level, and some take the path of expanding the field of movement. Division of labor and cooperation is the spirit, and decentralization or concentration is the method. This is the principle that the "practitioners" must put forward at this time and in this place and that every person engaged in it must implement. Mr. Lu Wang, rest assured: "The activities of the small theater in the past year" have not "formed a self-generating and self-extinguishing activity," nor is it a "purposeless and unconscious movement."

"Shanghai Dramatists" and "Inland Dramatists"

Finally, I want to mention an impression that I got from a reunion of "Inland Dramatists" who returned to Shanghai and "Shanghai Dramatists" who stayed in Shanghai. Everyone exchanged the experience they had gained in their work. The enthusiastic attitude between each other, no one had any difference because of the different groups they belonged to before. It seems unnecessary to propose who belongs to a certain theater group in this village Confucian style, because everyone belongs to the Republic of China Theater Troupe. Mr. Lu Wang may not have to provoke the feelings of the amateur experimental theater troupe members in the inland and the Shanghai dramatists. For the sake of the drama movement.

I have said so much, this is my first time, because I couldn't help it. However, at this time when everyone is buried in hard work and is too late, writing so many things feels a bit tired. I hope everyone will be more rational in the future and don't force me to waste and increase fatigue. (End)

### Pilgrimage to the Mountain

— Jing Ming

After the City God Bodhisattva moved into the concession, surprisingly, pious men and women came one after another to worship and ask for divination. Some people suspect that it is not the "real body" in the City God Temple and are very regretful; but no one protests. It is naturally profitable to paint a Bodhisattva to "link Rong's market"; it is not a big loss to burn a string of paper ingots and kowtow a few times, let alone "go in the dark, come in the dark," since the interests are shared equally, the City God Bodhisattva also smiles and opens his face and sits in the concession for a long time.

But human "intelligence" will never be complacent about it. Now, isn't there an abbot of "Buddhist land" who has launched the great undertaking of "pilgrimage to the mountain"? The people of the "isolated island" have welcomed the spring twice, but they miss the scenery of the foot of Ge Ridge, the bank of Su Causeway, and the cyan color of willow heads, and cannot help but yearn for it. It is allowed that the believers who suspect that the City God is not the "real body," how can they not yearn for the heavenly Buddhist lands of Lingyin and Tianzhu? Unfortunately, the "real bodies" of the heavenly Buddhist lands, like the City God Temple, cannot protect themselves, how can they protect "peace in the territory"? It is even more necessary to have a "pass" and a "good citizen certificate," otherwise, in addition to paper ingots and kowtowing, perhaps one's own life will also return to heaven, which is really contrary to the original intention of "pilgrimage to the mountain."

Now everything is no problem. The abbot "is responsible for accompanying the round trip and the safety of the journey." With such an unequivocal "responsibility," what can go wrong? Soon, we will see on the Su Causeway, where there is a willow tree and a peach tree, there will be a group of pious men and women hanging yellow cloth bags of "pilgrimage to the mountain" to pay tribute to the West Lake, which has been baptized by artillery fire.

However, the journey from Shanghai to Hangzhou is very long. Even if you take a "safe special car," you can't blindfold your eyes after all. Aren't the muzzles of machine guns sticking out of the bunkers on both sides of the railway? In the fields where love songs were sung in the past, isn't the grass now buried over the knees? If your home is near the railway, but what you see now may be broken walls, and maybe you will find two skeletons lying there. At this time, I am afraid that the "non-birth and non-death" chanting in the chest cannot be suppressed. Even if the "journey is safe" all the way, and the "real body" is verified, and incense is burned to fulfill the vow, can these shocking scenes guarantee "inner safety"?

Buddhism takes "compassion as its heart," no wonder those who make "national disaster money" also use "compassion" as a guise. What do I want to say!

### French Girl

— Yan Hua

"Say it in French"

Paramount Pictures Presents, Cathay Theatre Premiere

By chance, I saw the film "The Confessions of a Thief," starring Olympe Bradna, Gene Raymond, and Louis Stone. In this film, the radiant newcomer not only proved her acting ability, but also showed that her singing voice was not inferior to Deanna Durbin's. After seeing the film, I kept thinking that if there were a script like "Daniel Boone" and a director like that, Olympe Bradna would be able to act and sing just as well. However, among all the new films, I couldn't find her name. Had she been forgotten? No, with her singing and acting skills, she would definitely be reused by Hollywood film companies.

Then, in "French Girl," I saw Olympe Bradna's name. I thought that after a long absence, she would surely shine even more brilliantly. However, my high expectations were disappointed. In this chaotic and rough script, this talented actress had no opportunity to develop her acting skills, and her clear singing voice could not be showcased. After watching this film, I felt infinite regret. An excellent script and an outstanding director can indeed create a newcomer, but a mediocre playwright and a mediocre director can also ruin many potentially talented individuals, can they not?

If I were to give an example, Olympe Bradna would be a stark contrast. She was so lovely in "The Confessions of a Thief," but in "French Girl," she didn't even have a little chance to act.

The reason why the script for "French Girl" is so loose and weak is mainly due to the following reasons:

(1) Its structure is too loose, and the story's development is very disorganized.

(2) The characters, because they are too fantastical, have lost their reality.

(3) For the exposition or explanation of certain facts, the process of their transformation and the surrounding emotional atmosphere were not well written. Therefore, the depiction of each situation feels very rough and lacks power.

(4) What should be especially pointed out is that the leading actress was not given a good opportunity to act. Especially in the second half, the playwright almost abandoned her, which is a very poor way of presenting the story.

In general, "French Girl" commits a major flaw: it does not concentrate its efforts on depicting the main thread, but instead uses many trivial events and the appearance of minor characters to distract the audience's attention. This, it should be said, is the fatal flaw of the entire film.

As for the director, this unfamiliar director seems to be using small gimmicks everywhere to emphasize the light and humorous style of the play. Mainly, he wants to use comedic techniques to dissolve the atmosphere of the entire play in laughter.

Things like the breaking of the mirror at the banquet and the children following Richard in the park can only elicit a wry smile and cannot evoke genuine emotions. In other words, these places deliberately use gimmicks but feel stiff and forced.

Rémi Lussier's acting in the first half, when he had just returned from France, was better than in all his previous films because he was much more lively, but in the second half, it felt flat again.

Olympe Bradna had too few scenes and could not fully display her talents, which is very regrettable.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter Seven: The Paired Jades Reflect the Shadows of New Swallows and Orioles; The Seven Sections of Yue Silk and Wu Brocade are Woven on the Loom

However, Zhu Ai'ren had said something to them in the car yesterday, but today she had already forgotten it. What was that sentence? It was that she wanted the two He family daughters to take a photo together with these three children. He Liyu had remembered this matter well. Speaking of photography, both Liyu and Shuangyu were photographers, and they had very exquisite photographic equipment. They had even brought it to Anle Town, but they had not brought it to the orphanage. At this time, He Liyu saw a large photograph of the three children hanging in the room, so she walked closer to look at it and said, "Is this a recent photograph? Sister Ai'ren, I would like to have a recent photograph of these three little brothers. I wonder if you have one to give me?" Zhu Ai'ren quickly said, "Yes, yes! I have some at home. I'll give them to you when we get back." She suddenly remembered what she had said yesterday and said, "Ah! It's a pity you didn't bring your photographic equipment. If you had, we could have taken a picture of the two of you with the three little brothers. Because someone had quintuplets, all of America was in an uproar, and Hollywood's movie headquarters was making a movie about it from every angle. Now we'll give a discount, and even though it's not quintuplets from a single birth, we can put you together and make it a quintuplet from two births, just to make fun of it." When Tong Haiying heard this, she jumped up and said, "Do you really want to take a photo? Then I have a camera, and it's right here." Ms. Kang Ning was also very enthusiastic and said, "Just now Doctor Zhu said quintuplets from two births, so are these two He family daughters also twins? No wonder! I was saying that these two women looked so similar, so they are indeed twins. Then we must take a photo to commemorate it." At this time, Miss Tong Haiying hurried to her office to take out a newly purchased camera. She said, "The lens isn't very good, but it's still a domestic product. I've taken several dozen photos, and they're still clear enough. Why don't we try it?" Zhu Ai'ren said, "That's right! I had forgotten! Our little sister Haiying also likes to take photos. She has taken several photos with these three little brothers. She has also taken some photos of the other little brothers and little sisters. Then we'll take it right away. Should we take it inside the house or outside?" Haiying said, "The weather is warm today. We can take it outside, it's not a problem. Please sit down, you two sisters, and hold these three little brothers in your laps, or the three little brothers can sit there, and you two sisters can stand on either side of them, protecting them. Any pose is fine, just make it natural." (76)

Entertainment World

### The Story of the Vast Sky

— Tong Ye, Sent from Chongqing

In the afternoon, Gao, Zhao, and others took a boat with the Bai sisters to tour the mountains, entertaining themselves with songs. They saw Ge Haiwen and Ms. Liu walking together among the willows and peaches. The group jokingly asked Bai if she had a lover. Bai replied that she had two, one was the wind of Changbai Mountain, and the other was the young Chinese Air Force. Bai then smiled and sang, wishing herself to be forever the wind, awakening the sweet dreams of infatuated men and resentful women; blowing away the cowardly hearts of treacherous officials and rebellious sons; floating every day on airborne iron wings; kissing the tanned faces of the Air Force heroes; when aggressive enemies come to devour us, a storm rises, rolling up a huge wave of resistance, sending the Air Force, willing to fight for the survival of the nation and for the freedom and equality of the world...

At 6 PM, as usual, the aviation personnel returned to school by truck, and the Bai sisters waved goodbye from the hillside, their singing echoing the songs of the heroes on the truck.

The July 7th Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, and war clouds spread over the Far East. The northern war was not going well; the Air Force members, after reading the newspapers, were filled with passion and wished they could leave immediately to kill the enemy.

On Sunday morning, the four knights, Gao, Ju, Zhao, and Shi, visited Bai Shanfeng and saw the cafe half-closed, moving tables and chairs, preparing to close down. When asked why, Bai replied that she was leaving the cafe life to go elsewhere. The group was saddened. Bai told everyone that she did not want to leave the four of them in the future, hence today's departure, as Bai had signed up to join a battlefield nursing training class at a certain hospital.

The August 13th Shanghai battle broke out, and full-scale war began; the Air Force mobilization order was issued, and all Air Force heroes cheered upon hearing it. In a tragic and enthusiastic atmosphere, each team member made a will to show their determination to die for the country. On August 14th, enemy planes came to bomb Hangzhou. Gao Zhihang and Le Yiqin led their planes into aerial combat, heavily defeating the enemy forces. On July 7th, Yan Haiwen sacrificed himself in Shanghai, and on August 19th, Shen Chonghui crashed his plane into a warship and died in Longgang. Our heroic bombing units also established special merits. The victory of the Chinese Air Force gave the world a thunderbolt in the clear sky!

Gu was slightly injured in the August 14th aerial battle and was hospitalized. Gao, Zhao, and others came to the hospital to visit him. When they arrived, ladies from all over the city were holding flowers and sweets, coming to the hospital to offer their condolences in an endless stream.

Le Yiqin brought cigarettes and towels to the hospital to give to the wounded enemy Air Force prisoners. The enemy prisoners wept with gratitude, saying that they had been driven by warlords of their own country and did not want to fight yesterday.

Bai's younger sister, Xiaoyun, was also hospitalized due to being injured in the bombing. One day, enemy planes came to bomb wildly again, and Xiaoyun died. Gao, Zhao, and others were even more saddened. When going into battle, Zhao bravely chased the enemy planes alone, causing the enemy planes to take the opportunity to shoot down the plane of team member A. A parachuted and was injured. Team member C, a close friend of B, angrily rebuked Zhao after the battle. The squadron leader heard this and asked for the reason. The two were silent again. The squadron leader strongly admonished the two, following military orders, and placed them in confinement. One day, the two first glared at each other, then smiled and shook hands, explaining the misunderstanding, and finally encouraged each other to be honest and united and to serve the nation.

Suddenly, an air raid alarm sounded loudly, and each team member took off to kill the enemy. Team member B was surrounded, Gao went to rescue him and was seriously injured. In this battle, many enemy planes were destroyed again. After the battle, team member B hurried forward to shake hands with Gao to apologize. Gao tightly closed his mouth, not saying a word, and then shouted "Down with Japanese Imperialism!" and died coughing up blood.

Bai Shanfeng rushed over and tragically shouted to the sky: Young people of the whole country, rise up! Go to the sky! Defend the motherland... Thousands of planes took off through the clouds... (End)

### Promoting Cultural Exchange Between China and Foreign Countries: Public Performance of the Famous French Play Carmen (Part 1) Performed by the Eurasia Dramatic Arts Company at the Lyceum Theatre

— Bing Du

Starting from the beginning, the famous French opera "Carmen" was performed by the Shanghai Eurasia Dramatic Arts Company GrandOpera Shanghai at the Lyceum Theatre on the evening of the 30th at 9:00 PM. According to the company's publicity, the play was performed under the auspices of the French Consul General in Shanghai and the Shanghai French Association, and it "respectfully invited the envoys of various countries in Shanghai and the naval and land forces." Opera has a long history, and has been popular from medieval Roman theaters to Russia. The lyrics are like our Kunqu opera, with elegant words and phrases, composed of poetry. For example, the entire Carmen play is sung, and uses the features of singing, lighting, and acting to narrate a complex and lengthy romance in a well-organized manner within four hours. In the Western drama community, Opera is considered the most famous independent art. Although modern stage plays are flourishing, whenever an Opera is performed, the audience's enthusiasm remains as strong as ever. In Shanghai, Opera is rare, occasionally seen in the small theater of the White Russian dance troupe or introduced from the silver screen, but those are not very complete. The Eurasia Dramatic Arts Company is formed by a group of legal persons with overseas Chinese backgrounds and several Russian musicians serving in the French Municipal Council. Therefore, the performance of "Carmen" is not only mostly by Russians, but also sung entirely in Russian (the entire play basically does not use dialogue). Of course, for this company, whose professional purpose is to promote cultural exchange between China and foreign countries and to introduce Western opera, in addition to paying them due respect, we also feel that we should thank the goodwill of our friendly nations.

### A Visit to the Children's Amusement Park Held at the Green Gem Theater of the Sun Sun Company

— Shou Qiang

April 4th, this great day, this day that children will never forget, has once again arrived on the solitary island. In the current situation where millions of refugee children are wandering and destitute, crying for food, this commemorative day should have even greater significance. The Sun Sun Company, aware of this, has specially designated April 1st to 4th as the Children's Amusement Park held at the Green Gem Theater. Their slogan is "Celebrating Children's Day, Relieving Refugee Children," which is truly benevolent and commendable! The writer made a special trip in the rain yesterday to visit, and now I will sketch the highlights of the meeting below:

Although the weather was not good yesterday, with intermittent rain, the children who attended were very enthusiastic, gathered together, each revealing a joyous and innocent mood. In addition, the melodious music in the venue and the splendor of the theater evoked a harmonious aesthetic feeling.

The lights gradually dimmed, and at the opening of the curtain, the young technician Shi Zhonghua performed amazing magic tricks, such as drawing needles from his mouth and flying basins in the air. In the later scene, he threw four iron plates into the crowd at the same time, playing various tricks and deservedly winning a lot of praise from the audience. Next was the song and dance of the Ling Ling Troupe. Among them, the most exciting was the Fengyang Song and Wang Lao Wu performed by the child stars Ling Ling sisters. Not only were their expressions innocent and lively, but their singing was also round and mellow. The audience in the audience was moved by it, and the whole venue was immediately filled with thunderous cheers and applause. Ms. Wu's tap dance in the troupe was also very impressive. Finally, the famous magician Zhao Zhongshan performed a large set of Western magic, the main programs being Lucky Lamp Duck, the Chinese National Flag, Strange Umbrella, and Beauty Escapes Danger. The last scene was the most important, with decisive and extraordinary techniques. When the Chinese National Flag program was performed, the children in the audience rose to their feet in unison and showed respect to the national flag, indicating that the future of the Chinese nation is limitless!

In order to treat the children attending, the Sun Sun Company gave each person a cup of British and Swiss milk and a children's commemorative badge, with the words "Children Helping Children" written on it, which had profound meaning. A lottery was also held in the venue, giving away various valuable children's gifts, such as radios, tricycles, roller skates, violins, foreign dolls, art bookmarks, etc., as entertainment, so all the guests were satisfied.

It is said that the Sun Sun Company's radio station will broadcast a great children's program on April 4th. Their spirit of benefiting children is continuing unabated and is worthy of our admiration.

Today, due to advertising congestion, the space has been reduced, so "The Secret History of the Imperial Garden and Pear Garden of the Old Capital" will be temporarily suspended for one day and will be published tomorrow. This announcement.

### Chess Garden

— Edited by Bao Zibo, Checked by Lu Cheng

Opening Method, 25th Game

Black First

Reverse Palace Horse Horizontal Chariot Against Head-on Cannon

Method Following the Previous Game: Horse Eight Advances to Seven, Chariot Nine Moves to Four, Horse Seven Advances to Five, Cannon Two Advances to Four, Pawn Five Advances One, Cannon Two Moves to Five, Horse Three Advances to Five, Chariot Four Advances to Five, Explanation

The opening method is the method of arranging the pieces at the beginning of the game. Its sole purpose is to strive for initiative or neutralize the initiative. What kind of board should be used to strive for initiative, and what kind of board should be used to neutralize the initiative? The aim is to make it easy for learners to imprint them into their minds unconsciously. However, there are true initiative and false initiative (the initiative means the first move). In chess games, it is often said that gaining the initiative is the first move, that is, taking the initiative and controlling the situation, which also means striking first. True initiative is like attacking where the enemy must defend in military strategy. I attack and they defend, so I am slow and they are fast. False initiative means that on the surface it seems to have initiative, but after the move, the opponent can turn my move into uselessness. My move being useless is equal to an empty move, which is disadvantageous to me. My disadvantage is their advantage. Moves are divided into official moves and unusual moves. An official move is a fixed and unchangeable move. No matter what, it does not suffer losses, and is called an official move. An unusual move is knowingly inappropriate but forcibly done. Even if it succeeds by luck, it is an act of adventure and deception, which is occasionally done when there is no other choice. In this game, the opening uses the ninth soldier advancing one and the horizontal chariot, which is an unusual move. When the chariot moves to two, the horse eight advances to nine because the chariot nine can only advance one, so the side horse is used. Although the side horse is also an unusual method, the fifth soldier advances one to attack the middle road, and the eighth cannon returns to the head-on cannon. At this time, the situation instead allows the unusual wind to gain the upper hand.

The horse eight advances to seven to take the board head horse cannon situation, the chariot nine moves to four is an official horizontal chariot move, the cannon two advances to four to the horse three advances to five to break the chain of horses is the key move, as described in detail earlier, the chariot four advances to five to capture the horse and gain the upper hand. According to this game, the unusual style gains the upper hand, all caused by the opponent. If the red side does not use the soldier five to advance one to attack urgently, then the black side may not be able to gain the advantage. The general secret of unusual tactics is that unusual moves can be used for lower-ranked players (such as letting the lower-ranked player move a horse first), but when encountering equal-ranked players, be cautious and do not underestimate the enemy lightly.
