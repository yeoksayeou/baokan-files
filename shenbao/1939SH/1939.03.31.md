### Chinese Troops Recapture Fengxin; Fierce Fighting Continues in Northeastern Wuning Mountain Area; Objective of Attrition Warfare Achieved, No Need to Defend Nanchang to the Death; Japanese Offensive South of Yueyang Suffers Major Setback, Casualties Exceed 2,000; Remnants of Japanese Troops Completely Eliminated on Three Sides of Xinyang Suburbs

Xiushui: Japanese troops invading Wuning have suffered repeated heavy blows. On the morning of the 29th, Japanese troops launched a large-scale offensive. Chinese troops resisted heroically, fighting fiercely all day, killing countless Japanese troops. At this moment, fierce fighting continues with Japanese troops in the Zhanglinggong, Jiabainao, and Meiyanshan areas northeast of Wuning. (30th dispatch)

Gao'an: At 5 p.m. on the 29th, several hundred Japanese troops, accompanied by more than ten vehicles, stealthily invaded the vicinity of Xiangfu Temple (northeast of Gao'an). They were met with a head-on attack by Chinese troops, who killed many Japanese soldiers and destroyed one tank. The Japanese troops immediately fled in disarray. Japanese troops in Fengxin have suffered heavy casualties due to continuous attacks by Chinese troops in recent days. On the 29th, Chinese troops braved a hail of bullets to attack. The battle was extremely fierce. By the afternoon, the Japanese troops could not hold on and scattered in flight. Fengxin was thus declared recaptured. Liu Zheng is sweeping up the remaining Japanese troops. (30th dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, fighting on the Wuning front is continuing in the Wulishan area northeast of Wuning. Chinese troops in southern Henan have launched three offensives against Xinyang on the Pinghan Railway. Chinese artillery units are heavily shelling Japanese troops in the city. At the same time, it is reported that Japanese planes are bombing Chinese troops around Xinyang, and British-led Japanese troops are also rushing to Xinyang to reinforce. (30th Reuters dispatch)

Dongxiang: About one regiment of Japanese troops who crossed the Gan River from Shengmi Street continued to advance towards Gongjiadu (a station on the Zhegan Railway) southeast of Nanchang on the evening of the 28th. After being intercepted by Chinese troops, they are now facing each other in Shabutang (a station on the Zhegan Railway between Liantang and Liangjiadu). (30th dispatch)

Guilin: On the afternoon of the 28th, more than a hundred Japanese cavalrymen, accompanied by three mountain guns, shelled Wucun (seven li north of Gaoyou City) more than ten times. Japanese troops in the Fengxin area are currently operating in two routes, one towards Gao'an and the other towards Xiushui. The strength of the Japanese troops in the Wugang area is about five regiments. A part of the Japanese troops at Zhuxi crossed south, seemingly to reinforce Jing'an. A certain Chinese division is still engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese troops in the Ma'anshan-Daqiaohe area. (30th dispatch)

Guilin: A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission recently made a statement regarding the abandonment of Nanchang, saying that the Japanese have increased their troops in northern Jiangxi this time, making a final desperate effort. With a force of four divisions, they attacked Chinese Nanchang. After fierce resistance from Chinese troops, the Japanese suffered more than 15,000 casualties in ten days, and many high-ranking commanders could not escape. The Chinese side, having achieved the objective of attrition warfare, voluntarily abandoned Nanchang, which was only an empty city, on the 29th and made a planned transfer to a new position to prepare for a counteroffensive. From a purely military perspective, Nanchang has lost its value for a last-ditch defense. Furthermore, since Nanchang is no longer the seat of the Jiangxi provincial government in political terms, and all materials and people have long been evacuated according to plan, it has also lost its strategic position. Therefore, this abandonment of Nanchang is purely in accordance with the established consistent policy of protracted resistance and has no impact on the overall war situation, but only increases the difficulties for the Japanese and makes them more deeply mired in the quagmire. (30th dispatch)

(Changsha) Japanese troops at Xinkaitang and Matang in Yueyang have launched fierce attacks on Chinese troops for days since the reinforcements arrived on the 25th, but have been bravely repulsed by Chinese troops. During the Japanese offensive the day before yesterday, a part of the Chinese troops flanked them on the wings, and the battle was extremely fierce. The Japanese suffered more than 2,000 casualties and fled in panic towards Caijiatian. After this major defeat, the Japanese offensive was thwarted. Now, Chinese troops are taking advantage of the victory and advancing rapidly. (30th dispatch)

(Chongqing) Chinese military figures here declared last night that the highest authorities have instructed the troops on the Nanchang front to fight to the last man. At the same time, the new plan includes a large encirclement to cut off the Japanese retreat. Foreign observers believe that this new order indicates the determination of the Chinese military authorities to recover Nanchang. (30th Huitong dispatch)

Guilin: At dawn on the 24th, Chinese troops attacked Japanese troops at Xinkaitang and Matang. By noon, they had recaptured Qiguling (thirteen li south of Yueyang), killing hundreds of Japanese troops. Japanese troops in Yueyang are reinforcing that area. (30th dispatch)

Xiangyang: After the Japanese troops in Xinyang were fiercely attacked by Chinese troops yesterday, they suffered heavy casualties. This morning, Chinese troops completely eliminated the remnants of Japanese troops on the north, west, and south sides of the city and completely occupied all nearby strongholds, continuing to attack the city walls fiercely. Currently, Japanese troops and traitors in the city are tearing off their insignia and attempting to escape. (30th dispatch)

Changde: Huarong telephone report: (1) There are currently about 200 Japanese troops stationed at Bailuoji and Luoshan. Recently, they have ordered local residents to rush to build trenches. (2) Of the two Japanese warships originally anchored on the Chenglingji River, one withdrew downstream on the 29th. (30th dispatch)

### Chinese Troops Fiercely Battle for Ten Days and Nights, Still Firmly Holding the Outer Perimeter of Wuning

(Changsha) In this northern Jiangxi campaign, the defense of Wuning has been the most tragic and heroic. All defending troops have been able to display the highest degree of tenacity and a spirit of revenge. The Japanese troops began attacking Wuning on the 20th, with a force of about one and a half divisions, advancing along the Ruiwu Highway and the Ruoxi-Wuning section. They have been engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese defending troops for ten days and nights. The Japanese propaganda organs have admitted that two regimental commanders have been killed and two other senior unit commanders have been seriously injured. The casualties among the soldiers can be imagined. Chinese troops are using the hills on both sides of the highway to restrain the Japanese soldiers' advance. They engage in bayonet combat with the Japanese soldiers every meter, and only abandon after gaining satisfactory retribution. To date, the outer perimeter of the county seat is still in the hands of the Chinese troops. The city's south and west face the Xiu River. All Chinese officers and men are conducting a desperate bloody battle with the Japanese troops on the opposite bank of the Xiu River with the ambition to shake the mountains. The bravery and heroism of the Chinese troops in the past ten days have amazed and impressed even the Japanese officers. Yesterday, this station listened to a Japanese broadcast report about the setbacks they encountered in capturing Wuning and their praise of the Chinese troops. Only in the Songhu battle did they have such words for the Chinese Air Force martyr Yan Haiwen. This proves that the Chinese troops in Wuning are fighting to the death, making use of natural barriers, resisting fiercely, and launching counterattacks. They must fight to the last soldier and the last bullet for every high ground they occupy. Until the afternoon of the 25th, when Japanese artillery fire concentrated on Manshou Mountain and launched a fierce attack, the Chinese troops all retreated into the trenches and continued to return fire. Also, on the 24th, the Japanese Takagi unit seized the high ground west of Chen Village. At that time, a Chinese soldier was found in a trench, still resisting alone. When Japanese Lieutenant Matsumoto Katsutoshi approached him, the Chinese soldier suddenly rose up and stabbed fiercely, but eventually succumbed to the enemy and died calmly. The brave warrior was only a young man of about seventeen years old, a truly commendable and moving heroic feat. (30th dispatch)

### Chinese Troops in Eastern Hubei Recapture Wuxue

(Hankou) According to sources from neutral parties here, the Chinese troops under Liao Lei, operating in the Dabie Mountains, recaptured Wuxue, an important town on the north bank of the Yangtze River, on the 27th of this month. After the Japanese troops transferred reinforcements from the south bank on the 28th, they launched a counterattack against the Chinese troops. Both sides are still engaged in fierce fighting. According to Japanese sources, Wang Dan, under Liao Lei's command, took advantage of the Japanese troops' attack on Nanchang on the 26th of this month and led two Chinese divisions south from the Dabie Mountains, attacking Wuxue in an attempt to threaten the Japanese transport lines on the Yangtze River. The Japanese Sugiyama unit is engaged in fierce fighting with them. (30th Express News Agency dispatch)

Editorial

### On the Battle of Nanchang

The Japanese troops entered Nanchang. The Japanese side has been spreading the news for a week, claiming that they entered the city on the 20th. Therefore, a week ago, not only were there many internationally who were gullible, but foreign newspapers also discussed the importance of its relationship. Even the people of Shanghai mostly suspected that it had already been lost. However, according to Chongqing dispatches, at 5 p.m. on the 28th, there was still a telephone line from Nanchang to Chongqing, saying that they were preparing for street fighting. From this, it is known that the fact of its fall is still only a matter of the most recent two days. Propaganda should be based on facts. If it is "to be the first to worry about the world's troubles and the last to enjoy its pleasures," it is a national aspiration that cannot be applied to propaganda. China has never hesitated to speak frankly about the gains, losses, advances, and retreats in war reports, and it has always been seen that it can adhere to this principle. The Nanchang incident is just one example of this. However, there are those who criticize the reporting as not being as fast as the Japanese. This is because they love the country and worry about the times and are suffering from hypersensitivity.

Nanchang is the capital of Jiangxi Province. After the August 13th Incident, this is the eighth provincial capital to fall. Since the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Wuhan, some have been mistaken in thinking that from Shanghai to Nanjing, to Anqing, to Jiujiang, and to Wuchang, the battle line has shifted entirely westward. In fact, Nanchang is still about 600 li southeast of Wuchang. There are also those who are mistaken in thinking that since Nanchang has fallen, Jiangxi is finished. In fact, the Japanese troops in Jiangxi only occupy a line from Jiujiang to Nanchang, which is estimated to be only one-quarter of the entire north-south length of Jiangxi. In the past, the communist wars in Jiangxi lasted five or six years, and the battle zone was entirely south of Nanchang, far beyond the area that the Japanese troops are treading today. It is also an area where the Japanese troops are pale in fear and retreat at the sight of it. From Jiujiang, going west along the river to Wuchang, and south to Nanchang, forming a right angle, this is the Japanese troops' two prongs in Jiangnan. However, the Jiuling Mountains and Mufu Mountains form a mountain range that runs from southwest to northeast, naturally forming an angle bisector for the right angle. Therefore, although the Japanese troops occupy the two points of Wuchang and Nanchang, they are separated by towering mountains and cannot form a military defensive horn.

The gains and losses of Nanchang have no military value to speak of. What is more noteworthy is that Nanchang is the end point of the Zhegan Railway, going east through Guixi, Guangxin, Yushan, and into Zhejiang Province, further east through Changshan, Quzhou, and to Jinhua, then north through Xiaoshan and to the south bank of the Qiantang River. There is also a railway to Ningbo and a highway to Wenzhou and Haimen. Therefore, the transportation between Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces will be threatened by the loss of Nanchang. After the withdrawal of Chinese troops from Beijing-Hangzhou, although there is no important military transport to speak of, the circulation of civilian passengers and goods is indeed the artery of the local economy. If the Japanese troops further invade eastward along the Zhegan Railway from Nanchang, the route will inevitably be used by them. However, the military value of Zhejiang Province is originally equal to zero. The decisive factor in this war is definitely not in Zhejiang. In other words, Japan's gain of Zhejiang will not help its final defeat, and China's loss of Zhejiang will not hinder its struggle for victory. Therefore, even if the Zhegan Railway is used by the Japanese troops, it is not a serious problem at first. Even from the perspective of the local economy, the living conditions in the interior have not yet progressed to the point of relying on railways. Having railways is convenient, and not having railways is simply a matter of making do. Moreover, foreign trade has already been controlled by the central government. There are very few Zhejiang and Jiangxi products that can be exported during wartime, and even fewer Zhejiang and Jiangxi lives that depend on imports. Therefore, there is no serious impact on the economy either. All of the above are inferences assuming that the Japanese troops control the Zhegan Railway. However, controlling this route requires a significant price, and whether the Japanese troops have the strength to pay this price is a fundamental question.

If the Japanese troops do not invade eastward along the Zhegan Railway but instead look westward into Hunan, this is another matter that is more noteworthy. Going west along the highway from Nanchang, through Linjiang, Yichun, and Pingxiang, one enters Hunan Province. From this road, going south of Changsha, on one side, the Japanese troops in Yueyang are eyeing the north of Changsha, which is a pincer attack on Changsha. And the reason why the Japanese troops took Nanchang this time, if it is not their last struggle before their defeat, is a circuitous strategy for attacking Hunan. We do not want to discuss the difficulty of their march in western Jiangxi or the fact that Hunan Province is prepared. However, as far as we know, China's war plan has long chosen Hunan as an area for annihilating the enemy.

The world regards the gains and losses of Nanchang as a major event after the Battle of Wuhan. In fact, it is just an ordinary point. It only attracts attention because it is a provincial capital. What we cannot help but say is that all parties, after rational consideration of the war situation, are able to understand the difference between a point and a line and a plane, and that the advance and retreat of a city or a pool has nothing to do with the overall situation, and that final victory lies in protracted resistance. However, those who express it from the instinct of intuition, every time they hear of a retreat, have a degree of worry, and what they look forward to day and night is only good news. Therefore, they are happy when they hear the sound of the guerrillas' guns, and they are happy when they hear the sound of the Chinese Air Force's planes. This is indeed commendable, but knowing that the time for a general counteroffensive has not yet come, and that the opportunity for final victory has not yet arrived, then whether it is joy or doubt, it can be said that these are emotions that should be restrained. War is a major event. What is important is the basic shaking of the other side and the destruction of the other side's main force. What one seeks in oneself is to gradually consume the enemy in order to hasten its shaking and destruction. Such as the current battle in northern Jiangxi, the Japanese side describes its intensity, saying that it is no different from the Battle of Luxembourg in the European War. Describing their encounters, they say that they have never had such a bitter fight since August 13th. We ask, although their statement has a rather self-satisfied meaning, the extent of the Japanese consumption and the courage of the Chinese resistance can be easily understood. Observing the people of Shanghai, there are many who lament the continued loss of Nanchang, but few who are comforted by the number of enemies killed and the amount of enemies consumed. It is as if the death and injury of thousands upon thousands of enemy regimental commanders and below is not as gratifying as a few Chinese Air Force planes flying over the Huangpu River for a performance. This is extremely thoughtless. Being compared to the Battle of Luxembourg in the European War is enough to show the ferocity of the heroic resistance of the Chinese troops encountered by the Japanese side and the magnitude of the losses suffered by the Japanese troops.

At the beginning of this month, the Japanese troops transferred a part of their forces from central Hubei to northern Jiangxi. The original units entrenched in northern Jiangxi also began to stir. The Japanese troops launched an offensive in three routes this time: the right wing from Wuning and Dengxi, the middle route from Qiujin, and the left wing from Yongxiu, crossing the Xiu River south. On the Wuning front, Chinese and Japanese troops are still engaged in fierce fighting in the northwestern suburbs of the city. A part of the Japanese troops attacking Wuning fled east to Zhuxi, crossing the river south to attack Dongkou and other places. The Japanese troops in this area were everywhere ambushed by Chinese troops at key points such as Huangpugang, Danojian, Jiabailao, Huijieshan, Wangrennao, Jinjishan, Fenghuangshan, and Dongkou, suffering extremely heavy casualties. Several dozen important Japanese officers, including regimental commanders Miyawaki Iwao and Ejima Torao, and battalion commander Takagi Tamaki, were all killed by Chinese troops, completing their unfortunate "silent triumph." The Chinese defending troops in this area resisted heroically, never retreating until their men and bullets were exhausted. Such heroic deeds can truly shock heaven and earth and move the gods. Even the brutal Japanese troops sincerely admire and revere them.

On the middle route, Japanese troops released a large amount of poison gas on the afternoon of the 21st to cover their units crossing the Xiu River from Qiujin and attacking Mantou Mountain. The Chinese troops gave them a head-on blow, and more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers below Japanese regimental commander Iino were almost completely annihilated. Later, the Japanese brigade continued to attack south to Wanjiafu, then west to An'yi and Jing'an, while another part fled south to Fengxin, crossing the Nanliao River to attack Gao'an. Fortunately, a fresh Chinese force arrived in an emergency, and the Japanese troops who fled to Gao'an were intercepted and contained, fleeing to Fengxin. A certain Chinese unit then launched a fierce counterattack, and the Japanese troops were almost completely defeated. Japanese commander Miyazaki and others were killed by Chinese troops in this battle. Fighting is still continuing in this area.

As for the Japanese troops on the left wing, they crossed the Xiu River from Yongxiu and fled south along the railway line to Lehua, reaching Niuhang, attempting to bypass the southwest suburbs of Nanchang by having a part of them go further south around Shengmi Street and forcibly cross the Gan River, launching a large-scale offensive. The Chinese defense forces in the suburbs of Nanchang, even at a time of extreme danger, did not lose heart, determined to live and die with the city, and continued to resist bravely. Until the afternoon of the 28th, the Chinese defense forces were still reporting the situation by telephone to the rear. And fighting until the 29th, most of the Japanese troops were still engaged in a major battle with the Chinese field army in the suburbs. Another small part of the Japanese troops had sneaked into the city from the south gate, engaging in fierce street fighting with the Chinese defending troops, with bayonets clashing and mountains shaking. It is reported that there were as many as three regiments of Japanese troops sneaking into Nanchang. (30th dispatch)

### Finance Ministry Spokesperson Declares Normal Repayment of British and French Loans Due, Other Debt Repayment Methods Under Negotiation with Creditors

(Chongqing) The Finance Ministry spokesperson added an explanation today regarding Minister Kong's statement on March 26 regarding the disposal of debt secured by salt tax. The general idea is divided into three points: (1) Before the government and relevant parties complete negotiations, public bonds secured by salt tax should be handled in the same way as the method implemented for customs duty-secured public bonds on January 15. In other words, a portion of the debt secured by salt tax will be handled by the Central Bank in a separate special account. (2) The British and French loans due on April 5 will still be paid on schedule because the paying agencies had previously received funds allocated by the Finance Ministry, which are sufficient for debt payment. However, this can only be regarded as a special event. (3) The government is currently negotiating with the representatives of the creditors, striving to find a suitable and practical method under the current situation to maintain creditworthiness.

### Belligerent Nation Nearing Its End, Future Diplomatic Trends, Plans to Adjust Relations with Britain, America and France, Arita Invites Envoys from the Three Countries for Talks

(Tokyo) It is heard that Foreign Minister Arita has invited British Ambassador Craigie, French Ambassador Henry, and American Ambassador Grew to his official residence on the 31st of this month to discuss a certain diplomatic matter. However, the specific details remain unknown. (31st Reuters Dispatch)

(Tokyo) People here are paying close attention to the meeting between Prime Minister Hiranuma and former Prime Minister Konoe on Wednesday. It is said that the two exchanged opinions on Japanese domestic policies related to the recent situation in Europe and various domestic issues. Hiranuma and Konoe will meet again on April 1st. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

(Hong Kong) A Tokyo dispatch states that after the closing of the Japanese Diet, Hiranuma has begun his political work, and his future actions are particularly noteworthy. On the 29th, Hiranuma met with domestic journalists and expressed numerous opinions on current domestic and foreign issues. Hiranuma first stated, "The basic principles of Japan's diplomatic national policy were meticulously decided by the previous cabinet and have not changed to this day. However, the specific plans for implementing these basic principles must be altered to adapt to changes in the international situation. This is a difficult issue to explain in detail. It is difficult to make people understand without providing concrete examples. Once examples are refused, it is difficult to initiate discussions." Hiranuma also stated, "Japan does not belong to the totalitarian bloc, nor does it belong to the democratic nations' front." When a reporter asked about the Soviet fisheries issue, Hiranuma replied, "There is no reason to be optimistic, but I am not pessimistic either." Another reporter asked about the future of the Anti-Comintern Pact and whether Japan needed to issue a statement. Hiranuma only stated, "There may be a need to issue a statement in the future." Hiranuma acknowledged that there are various difficulties in adjusting diplomatic relations with Britain, the United States, and France, but because there is a demand for adjustment, the difficulties must be overcome. However, he did not specify how to adjust. Regarding foreign exchange policy, Hiranuma stated that the rate of one shilling and two pence must be maintained. Regarding the future of the war against China, Hiranuma stated, "The basic policy towards China was decided by the previous cabinet, and the current cabinet will continue to implement it. There is no intention to issue a statement, nor is there a need to convene an Imperial Conference or a joint meeting of the Great Headquarters and the Cabinet." Regarding domestic issues, Hiranuma stated, "Japan must realize the necessity of preventing and expanding industrial production, but this cannot be achieved without implementing resource mobilization." This seems to imply that depending on the needs of the environment, it may be necessary to implement the National General Mobilization Law article by article. Finally, Hiranuma stated, "The two positions of Minister of Communications and Minister of Colonial Affairs in the cabinet are currently held concurrently. People will be selected to fill these positions soon, but this is not a reorganization." Konoe will serve as a minister without portfolio. (29th Dispatch)

### Japanese Finances, Stretched Thin, Chinese Guerilla Tactics Are Exquisite, Sufficient to Inflict Significant Damage on the Enemy

Havas News Agency, New York, March: At the current dinner of the Foreign Relations Association, Professor [blank] Eldon, a lecturer in Japanese history at Columbia University, gave a speech on the financial and economic situation of Japan. He mainly stated that although Japanese finances are stretched thin, they have not reached the point of collapse. Some people have predicted that Japan's national debt would reach 100 trillion yen, which would be unsustainable. In fact, it has already exceeded this amount and has reached 100 trillion yen. However, the Japanese government issues public bonds to cover various expenditures, most of which are absorbed by national banks, amounting to about 300 million yen per month. The savings of its citizens increased to 300 million yen last year, indicating that the point of financial collapse is still some distance away. From an economic perspective, Japan's trade surplus with the "countries" of the Great East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere last year was as high as 60 million yen, but the total foreign trade was a deficit, amounting to as much as 492,000,000 yen. Hanson, a reporter for the United Press, who had gone to the Chinese mainland to observe and interview, and had spent some time with the guerilla units, also spoke at the meeting, briefly discussing guerilla tactics. He stated that the areas occupied by the Japanese army are limited to the transportation lines. Outside of this narrow area, they cannot effectively control the military, political, and economic aspects. Although military experts say that guerilla forces cannot achieve a lasting victory, in reality, guerilla tactics often pose a serious threat to the enemy's morale, which is the main factor in victory. Some commentators say that the Chinese are not good at warfare, while others say that the peaceful Chinese farmers have transformed into valiant warriors. It is unknown which of these two views is correct. This is the most elusive aspect of the Sino-Japanese War.

### Soviet Union and US Expand Navies, Japan Reveals Unease

(Tokyo) Navy Ministry spokesperson Kanazawa replied to questions from a certain foreign journalist today, stating that some Soviet submarines may have been built in Vladivostok, but most were clearly built within the Soviet Union in Europe, disassembled and transported to Vladivostok by train or ship, and then assembled in Vladivostok. It is heard that Soviet submarines bound for Vladivostok have been discovered outside of Singapore, but the number that have sailed from the sea to the Far East must be very small. Soviet submarines are divided into two types: one is 1,200 tons, and the other is 600 tons. When a certain foreign reporter inquired about the United States' preparation for two 45,000-ton battleships, Kanazawa replied that Japan gives full consideration to the naval situation of the world, especially the major naval powers, when formulating its naval policy. (30th Reuters Dispatch)

(Washington) According to news from here today, the two 45,000-ton battleships that the United States plans to build this year will surpass other warships in terms of power, speed, and range. The ships will be equipped with twelve 16-inch guns. Previously, 39,000-ton battleships had only nine 16-inch guns. The speed will be 30 nautical miles per hour. The distance that can be traveled on a single load of fuel is unknown. The length of the ship is 880 feet, and the beam is 108 feet. The cost is 95 million US dollars per ship. In addition, the Navy also plans to build a large fleet of 3,000-ton small ships. (30th Associated Press Dispatch)

### US-China Legislation, Amendment Issues, Deeply Concerned About Being Unfavorable to China, Senators Adopt a Cautious Attitude

(Washington) Today, government officials and members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hope that the committee can pass the "Cash and Carry" clause in Senator Pittman's Neutrality Act within two weeks. Some government officials and senators believe that the clause is unfavorable to China because China does not have ships to transport military supplies, while Japan does. Therefore, they are adopting an extremely cautious attitude regarding whether to approve the clause. Other senators believe that the clause is the only effective way to deal with the current situation in Europe. They believe that European powers friendly to China can transport military supplies from the United States through the Suez Canal to Burma, and then transport them overland to China. The Japanese blockade of the Chinese coast has made it impossible for the United States to directly transport military supplies to China. The government is very hopeful that the bill can be passed as soon as possible, but some senators will vigorously oppose the bill because they still have differing opinions.

### France Truly Augments, Vietnam Defenses, Aircraft Factory Nearing Completion

(Paris) Colonial Minister Mandel informed the Colonial Committee of the Chamber of Deputies today that the government has taken appropriate measures to augment the defenses of various colonies, especially Vietnam and Somaliland. In Vietnam, since the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island, all defenses have been greatly improved. The government is also building a large-scale aircraft factory there to manufacture aircraft locally, which will be completed soon. (29th Havas)

### British House of Lords Passes Bill Approved by King, Exchange Equalisation Account Bill Established, British MPs Concerned About Interests in China, Hong Kong Emergency Security Law Prompts Questions

(London) The House of Lords today passed the bill guaranteeing a loan of 5 million pounds sterling to China to充法幣 Exchange Equalisation Account. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

(London) At today's meeting of the British House of Commons, concern for China did not diminish due to the tension in Europe. Members continued to raise various questions regarding British interests in China. Under-Secretary of State Butler replied to a certain question, stating that the Japanese government has paid the British government 20,000 yuan in Chinese currency as compensation for the loss of life caused by the Japanese air raid on Shenzhen when bombs fell on British territory. Members also asked Butler to state the current status of Inner Mongolia. Butler then listed the situation of the Mengjiang United Committee and the small autonomous governments of Chahar and Northern Shanxi, and stated that Japanese troops are stationed in various places along the Ping-Sui Railway, but the British government has not received accurate information on their exact number. Labour MP Sorensen asked the government to pay attention to the Hong Kong Emergency Security Ordinance, which authorizes local authorities to arrest and deport people who are "obviously without legitimate employment," and suggested that such cases should be handled by the courts to avoid unfair situations. Dominions Secretary Inskip replied that such security ordinances are justified when an emergency situation exists and there is no risk of unfairness. Sorensen insisted on his question, and said that any arbitrary and unfair actions would be bad publicity for the Hong Kong government. Inskip replied that the Hong Kong government must take special actions to deal with tens of thousands of refugees in special circumstances. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

### Poland Firmly States, Will Not Abandon Danzig, Nor is Willing to Join the Anti-Comintern Pact, Anti-German Sentiment is High Among the People

Warsaw: Polish Senator Colonel Miedziński declared at the meeting yesterday, "Poland will never agree to return Danzig to Germany or build a highway in the Polish Corridor. At the same time, it is unwilling to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. If any party makes any one or several of the above three demands to Poland, then Poland's answer is only a firm 'No.'" (30th Huitong Dispatch)

(London) Although Polish officials have denied rumors that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop held talks with Polish Ambassador Lipski on the Danzig Free City issue last Sunday, reliable sources confirm that this is indeed the case. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is said to have proposed to Ambassador Lipski that negotiations be conducted on the following three issues: (1) the sovereignty of the Danzig Free City; (2) Germany's construction of a highway through the Polish Corridor to East Prussia; and (3) Poland's attitude towards the Berlin-Rome Axis. The ambassador then rushed back to Warsaw to report this proposal to Foreign Minister Beck. The Polish government has not yet provided an answer, but the country's military authorities have augmented the size of the army and issued national defense bonds to strengthen the air force and improve air defense matters. The significance of this should not be underestimated. (30th Havas Dispatch)

Warsaw: Anti-German sentiment in Poland has recently increased even more. Newspapers are using extremely agitated tones regarding the issues of Upper and Western Silesia. Polish radicals have poured into German public places, demanding that everyone immediately stop speaking German, which immediately led to clashes. Tables and chairs flew everywhere, and as a result, a German man, Minde, was seriously injured. (30th Huitong Dispatch)

### Foreign Minister Beck, To Soon Visit England

Warsaw: Foreign Minister Colonel Beck is scheduled to travel to England via Calais, France, on the 3rd of next month. He is expected to arrive in London that evening and visit British Foreign Secretary Halifax for lunch on the 4th, and meet with Prime Minister Chamberlain in the afternoon. (30th Havas Dispatch)

### Mercantile Bank, Business Report, Affected by Sino-Japanese War

(London) The Financial Times reported that events in China and India forced Mercantile Bank Chairman Willis to use slightly more cautious language when reporting on business conditions at the annual meeting, but there is a reason for this. Judging from the bank's profit and loss statement, one might get the impression of business losses, but after Willis explained, it was known that the truth was the opposite. The business was not in deficit. According to Willis, the decrease in the bank's current accounts was due to the fluctuation of the true value of the Chinese legal tender. The overall decrease in the bank's deposits was technically due to the low exchange rate of the Chinese currency. As far as the bank's experience is concerned, it has never been inferior to HSBC. A Times of London editor claimed that in the shadows of Cheng's detailed description of the current situation in China, there is a torch of light. The editor was referring to China's efforts to build an economic system in the western provinces and re-establish the broken lives of millions of merchants, workers, and artisans who moved west from the Yangtze River basin in areas with hidden resources that have not yet been developed.

### British Territorial Army Personnel, Placed on a Wartime Basis, Will Increase to 32 Divisions, 340,000 Men, Prime Minister Chamberlain Announced Yesterday in the House of Commons

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that the Territorial Army will be placed on a wartime basis and will be doubled, so that thirty-two divisions can serve overseas. These thirty-two divisions will replace the nine divisions announced by War Secretary Hore-Belisha three weeks ago. The Prime Minister also stated that this measure is the first result of the new international situation prompting him to re-examine all aspects of national life. In carrying out this review, the government deeply felt that there was still a need to continue to utilize the spirit of voluntary service shown by the entire country, especially thinking that those who wish to join the Territorial Army must not be rejected because the troops they wish to join have exceeded the prescribed strength. Therefore, the 130,000 men of the Territorial Army on a peacetime basis will be raised to a wartime basis, with the number set to increase by about 40,000 men. The Territorial Army on a wartime basis will be twice as large as before, with a total of 340,000 men. The Prime Minister also mentioned the need to maintain this increased force due to the increased potential for war. Liberal Party leader Sinclair raised a supplementary question about the establishment of a Ministry of Supply. The Prime Minister replied that the government has not yet had the opportunity to consider whether it needs to revise its views on this issue after the increase in the strength of the national defense forces, but it will give it full consideration. The Prime Minister also confirmed the statement made by Labour Party leader MP Greenwood, that the government's proposal proves that the government believes that the possibilities of what voluntary service can achieve have not been exhausted. Greenwood continued, saying that this can indicate that the government has the ability to meet all the needs of the country. The Prime Minister also admitted, when questioned by a certain MP, that the issue of compulsory national service in Britain was discussed with French Foreign Minister Bonnet last week, but he declined to comment on the progress of the talks. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

Warning to Aggressor Nations, Britain and France Respond in Concert

(New York) The New York Times stated that after Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech, Britain and France responded simultaneously. The Axis governments cannot but pay attention to these two countries' responses. French Prime Minister Daladier gave a radio address according to his scheduled time, and the words of the British Prime Minister suddenly came. Chamberlain's announcement of doubling the strength of the British Territorial Army undoubtedly warns Italy not to resort to force in order to achieve its plans in the Mediterranean region, which have not yet been clearly announced. (30th Reuters Dispatch)

(Berlin) Today, all the newspapers here published the news of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement that the Territorial Army will be strengthened by doubling, with large headlines. It explains this development as a middle ground, on the one hand it can meet France's expectations for British conscription, and on the other hand it can avoid causing the well-known British aversion to compulsory military service. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

(London) According to a certain diplomatic observer, the two major events today are Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement of increasing the Territorial Army to 340,000 men, and Prime Minister Daladier's radio speech that he would not allow the cession of an inch of French territory or abandon any of France's rights. The observer praised Daladier's speech, saying that it expressed a willingness to test any suggestions from Italy, and pointed out that after Britain increased the Territorial Army, it would have 26 Territorial Army divisions in addition to the six divisions of regular troops overseas, and would have a powerful army to intervene in Europe if necessary. According to information obtained by Reuters, the British conscription authorities are confident that they will have sufficient recruits to reach the new quota for the Territorial Army. It is heard that there are many regular army officers who can fill command positions, and there are also thousands of soldiers who have completed their military service who can rejoin to fill junior officer positions. British political figures welcomed Daladier's speech, believing that its wording was harmonious, but expressed that they could not compromise on important points, and believed that the solution to this matter was not hopeless, given Daladier's speech and Italy's unpretentious wishes. Diplomatic circles here believe that the important action in European politics thereafter will be the visit of Polish Foreign Minister Beck to London next week, and said that Germany has been working hard on propaganda, aiming to persuade Beck to cancel this trip. The most obvious thing is that many of the publicity materials for this campaign are only given to foreign reporters in Berlin and not published in German newspapers. Poland is obviously prepared to respond in the same way to Germany's campaign. From the news published in Polish newspapers today, it can be seen that the government and the mouthpieces of the opposition parties have now formed a solid front to resist German attacks, solemnly declaring that while Polish policy has not changed in the slightest, Germany has abandoned its "Greater Germanism" and adopted a policy of European imperialism, which will definitely lead to a bad reaction from Poland.

### British Cabinet Members Lobby the Soviet Union, Differences of Opinion Have Been Dissolved

Danzig: The "Danziger Zeitung" published an editorial today, commenting on British Overseas Trade Minister Hudson's visit to Poland and the Soviet Union. The newspaper stated that Hudson has already failed in Poland, and after arriving in Moscow, he lobbied the Soviet Union to join the anti-German front. The Soviet Union proposed exchange conditions, saying that Britain must adopt an attacking attitude towards Japan. According to the official Soviet Russian communique, after Hudson's visit to Moscow, some differences of opinion between Britain and the Soviet Union have been dissolved. (30th Huitong Dispatch)

### London and Paris Public Opinion, Express Unanimous Welcome

(London) This morning, all the newspapers here published Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement on the strength of the Territorial Army and Prime Minister Daladier's broadcast speech in extremely prominent positions. Except for the Daily Mail, which did not agree with the government still adhering to the volunteer military service system and advocated changing to a compulsory military service system, all the newspapers welcomed the speeches of the prime ministers of Britain and France. The Times stated that the welcome of the Prime Minister's announcement is a true expression of British volunteerism. The Daily Telegraph said that the people of the country heard the Prime Minister's words with joy, and there is no more welcome and timely step than this. The newspapers all praised France's solemn and firm position, and hoped that aggressor nations would pay attention to Prime Minister Daladier's warning. (30th Reuters Dispatch)

(Paris) Newspapers of all parties in France unanimously agreed with Prime Minister Daladier's remarks. Le Petit Parisien stated that Daladier's remarks were not only powerful but also clearly stated that France does not harbor hatred for anyone. The entire population agrees with the words used by Daladier, because they are words suitable for reason and not words of provocation and anger. France does not reject negotiations aimed at studying legitimate and honest rights claims, and will never recognize that others can force France to accept their wishes. (30th Reuters Dispatch)

### Righteous Virtue Counters Annihilation

(Rome) Mussolini's spokesman, Gaida, recently commented in the Italian newspaper on the speech delivered yesterday by French Prime Minister Daladier, stating that France has absolutely no room for concessions regarding our country's demands. This has been confirmed by Prime Minister Daladier. "The door for negotiations between France and Italy was originally half open and half closed, but the French side clearly intends to close it. Our country should record this and wait for developments." However, Prime Minister Mussolini said that there is still a wide gap between France and Italy that cannot be filled. Prime Minister Daladier said that Italian residents within Tunisia have not been mistreated, which shows that "the French government is unwilling to discuss territorial issues or rights issues, and its intention is to alienate our country and stubbornly adhere to its own views. Under these circumstances, the dispute between France and Italy will inevitably become more serious, and we should start doing other things, but not forget this dispute," he said. (30th Havas News Agency)

(Rome) The initial impression in Italy of French Prime Minister Daladier's speech last night is, in short, that Italy deeply feels that France has not taken responsibility for developing peaceful relations between France and Italy. Officials believe that opinions can only be made public after the full text of the speech arrives here. However, Italian political figures have stated that France clearly intends to ignore Italy's natural demands. It is generally pointed out here that Italy's demands on France are based on Italy's recent historical developments and do not violate the Treaty of London in 1915. In short, Daladier's failure to pay attention to these facts constitutes an attempt to attack Italian fascism, it is said. (30th Reuter's News Agency)

(Berlin) After French Prime Minister Daladier delivered his speech yesterday, German political figures have remained mostly silent, only stating that Italy should express its views first. Most newspapers have published brief excerpts without printing the full text of the speech. The local Guidance Newspaper reported that Prime Minister Daladier refused to make concessions to Italy and showed no understanding towards foreign countries. The Hamburg Foreign Review reported that Prime Minister Daladier was very willing to start negotiations with Italy, but insisted that the negotiations should be based on the Franco-Italian agreement of 1935, it is said. (30th Havas News Agency)

### French Prime Minister Reiterates Determination to Safeguard Territory; Willing to Open Negotiations with Italy Based on Agreement; Willing to Fight to Defend Freedom

(Paris) Prime Minister Daladier delivered a broadcast speech this evening. The first part explained the goals of French policy and the strength of the nation. The second part criticized totalitarian countries. The third part explained the relationship between France and Italy. The fourth part explained the relationship between France and Germany. The conclusion was a call for all peace-loving countries in the world to cooperate with each other. The full text of the speech is excerpted below:

National Unity to Face the Crisis

The Prime Minister began by saying that, at present, countries are wary of their neighbors and are actively replenishing their military equipment. All kinds of normal activities have been destroyed as a result. The instability of the international situation can be said to have reached its peak. One might ask, "What does France desire in this situation?" I will answer that France desires to maintain peace among free people. One might also ask, "Where does France's strength lie?" I will answer that when France faces a crisis, it can unite spiritually and materially. This is where its strength lies. One might also ask, "What kind of determination does France hold?" I will answer that France is determined to safeguard its ideals and rights. In short, the unity, firmness, and strength of France today are unprecedented. Because France abhors war, it deeply hopes that peace can be preserved. However, if it is forced to choose between fighting and humiliation, it will not hesitate to rise up and defend freedom.

Great Strength, Not Afraid of Tyranny

As for France's strength, the factors that constitute it are numerous. To list the most important ones, there are several: (1) The financial economy has been improving daily. (2) The vast colonial empire with African territories as its center is very powerful. I personally visited North Africa and deeply know that its people are loyal to the motherland. (3) The spiritual and moral values ​​possessed by the French nation are also the source of national power, such as respecting individual rights, tolerating various opinions, and the automatic unity of the entire nation in maintaining truth and justice under the condition of maintaining a free order. All of these are virtues of the French people. (4) The army is powerful, and the whole country participated enthusiastically when the government previously decided to take various measures in the military. This is especially gratifying. (5) The friendship France maintains with various countries is also a major source of its strength.

Strong Criticism of Totalitarian Countries

At this point, Prime Minister Daladier turned to criticizing the new methods adopted by certain countries, saying, "These countries equate enslaving the people with freedom and destroying civilization with progress. Their authorities claim to be working for the welfare of mankind, but only make mankind bankrupt. In France, it is the opposite. Everyone can choose their way of life and freely believe in what they want to believe without being enslaved. Because we believe in this principle, we never believe that everything between countries should be based on force. For the French, international relations should be based on justice and law. Force should not be used until justice and law no longer exist."

Accusation of Italy Unilaterally Abolishing Treaty

Regarding the relationship between France and Italy, the agreement signed by both sides on January 7, 1935, has effectively resolved all issues, and France has fulfilled all its obligations. However, on December 17 of last year, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano suddenly sent a note to our government, stating that the country no longer considered this agreement to be valid. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini said in a speech on the 26th of this month that all of the country's demands had been explained in detail in this note, and specifically mentioned the issues of Tunisia, Suez, and Djibouti. Outsiders, unaware of the situation, mistakenly believed that the country's government had received a formal notice and had not yet submitted a reply.

Arguments Held are Difficult to Accept

In order to dispel doubts, the government has decided to publish the exchanges between the two sides. "I must announce to the world that the note submitted by Italy did not list any demands, nor did it involve the issues of Zurich, Djibouti, and Tunisia. It only stated that the country had obtained new rights after conquering Abyssinia, and that the Franco-Italian agreement of 1935 was no longer considered valid. Of course, we cannot accept this kind of argument. If Italy's claim is true, then every time a place is conquered, new rights will arise, and the country will inevitably make other demands, one after another, without end. But France will never give up an inch of its land, nor will it give up the slightest bit of its rights. This is especially reiterated here." However, the French government is still prepared to faithfully implement the spirit and words of the Franco-Italian agreement of 1935 on the basis that I have explained. France is willing to consider any suggestions that Italy puts forward on this basis. As for the current situation in the protectorate of Tunisia, it is said that 94,000 Italian residents have been mistreated. In fact, Italian residents and their children have always enjoyed the most liberal treatment, not only in Tunisia, but also in the French mainland. The facts are there and do not need to be restated.

No Adjustment to German Relations

Regarding the relationship between France and Germany, the government has made many efforts in the past to reach an understanding with Germany, such as the signing of the Munich Agreement and the publication of the Franco-German "Non-Aggression Declaration." A French economic delegation went to Berlin to negotiate a trade agreement, but Germany's conquest of Czechoslovakia and occupation of Prague have dealt a great blow to our country's efforts. In the past few years, some people have often cited the right of national self-determination as a justification for certain actions. Later, some people spoke of natural aspirations. Today, some people are promoting the room for survival. What they are saying is just a synonym for continuing conquests.

Appeal to All Countries to Strengthen Cooperation

At a time when the whole world is at risk of war, I, in the name of France, appeal to all peace-loving countries to cooperate with each other. All countries that share our feelings and are prepared to rise up and resist future aggressors must unite. This appeal, I believe, will have an impact throughout Europe and even across the Atlantic Ocean.

Regarding the relationship between Britain and France, the two sides have the same views and have decided to work hard using the same methods and the same goals. It is hoped that all rational people in the world (all countries, without distinction, are not lacking in rational people) can listen to this rational call," he said. (29th Havas News Agency)

### French Government Publishes Documents of Exchange Between France and Italy; Proving that Italy's Cancellation of the Treaty Lacks Sufficient Reason

(Paris) The note submitted by the Italian government for cancelling the Franco-Italian agreement of 1935 and the reply submitted by France have recently been published by the government.

The Italian note was delivered by the Italian Foreign Minister Ciano to the French Ambassador Ponsot on December 17 of last year. The main points are as follows: (1) Article 7 of the Franco-Italian agreement stipulates that this agreement shall take effect as soon as both parties exchange ratification documents, but the exchange procedure has not yet been implemented. (2) Article 1 of the Franco-Italian agreement stipulates that both parties shall establish a special treaty on the Tunisia issue so that it will take effect at the same time as this agreement. Negotiations have not been conducted on this point. It can be seen that the agreement signed by France and Italy to adjust their interests in North Africa has not yet been completed. (3) The Franco-Italian agreement was based on several definite conditions, and these conditions have not yet been confirmed. (4) The Franco-Italian agreement focuses on developing friendship between the two sides and laying a foundation for sincere cooperation. The Italian government is willing to sacrifice the rights enjoyed by Italian residents in Tunisia and the rights stipulated in Article 13 of the Treaty of London in 1915. It is originally hoped that France can understand the country's demand to expand its power in East Africa. Later, when Italy was forced to resolve its relationship with Abyssinia, France failed to show understanding, and even after the fact, its attitude was contrary to Italy's expectations, which is regrettable. In short, the Franco-Italian agreement has not yet been implemented. Your ambassador must have noticed it when he met with me on December 2. It is not appropriate to consider it valid. Since the implementation of sanctions against Italy by various countries, the situation has changed rapidly, and the Franco-Italian agreement is of course no longer applicable. In addition, since Italy established an empire, it has acquired several important new rights and interests, and the relationship between France and Italy cannot be based on the 1935 agreement. In order to enhance mutual relations between the two governments, it is necessary to re-discuss it, it is said.

The French reply was issued on December 25 of last year, stating that the Franco-Italian agreement has been ratified by the French Parliament. The reason why the ratification documents have not been exchanged is that the special treaty on the Tunisia issue could not be declared established in advance. However, the establishment of this special treaty was the voluntary decision of the Italian government, and the blame does not lie with France. On the contrary, France has transferred 2,500 shares of the Djibouti Port to Addis Ababa Railway Company to Italy, which shows that the Franco-Italian agreement has indeed begun to be implemented, and Italy is enjoying its benefits. Later, negotiations were conducted several times, until April 22, 1938, when French chargé d'affaires Blanc-Tailleur met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. The Italian side always admitted that this agreement had indeed been established, and the French side did not have any expression that could provide Italy with an excuse to change its attitude. In addition, it initiated the recognition of the Italian Empire in Geneva on May 12, 1918, in order to realize it. Furthermore, on October 12 of that year, Ponsot was appointed as ambassador to present his credentials to the King of Italy and Emperor of Abyssinia. It has been benevolent and righteous. As for France's attitude during the Italo-Ethiopian War, it had to be so because it had international obligations. Former French Prime Minister Laval had explained it to Prime Minister Mussolini. In short, France's actions had a moderating power. On the one hand, it had to be willing to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the League of Nations covenant, and on the other hand, it made every effort to maintain friendship between France and Italy. This was also recognized by Prime Minister Mussolini and has been repeatedly praised by him, it is said. (29th Havas News Agency)

### American Sympathy

(Washington) The speech delivered yesterday by French Prime Minister Daladier has been warmly welcomed by American political figures, who praised "France's calm self-esteem and its moderate but firm attitude." All of this can be seen in it. Daladier's words are clear, which is the opposite of the violent rhetoric of the dictators. The State Department said that France's position on Italy's demands should be strongly supported. Prime Minister Daladier's statement that "every time a place is conquered, new rights will come with it, which is difficult to recognize" is especially sympathetic to the United States. The key turning point in France's attitude lies in this. This is consistent with the fundamental views of the United States. In short, the wish of most of mankind is to restore the principles of international law and establish a moral order, which all parties are willing to maintain. If a certain country wants to replace it with violence one day, then a fair solution will not be established one day, it is said. (30th Havas News Agency)

### Germany, Italy, and Spain Will Hold a Tripartite Conference; News Regarding Italian Prime Minister's Whereabouts Seems to Have Been Verified

It was reported from the Italian harbor that Mussolini arrived at this harbor today, and that the Italian Prime Minister is now going to Sicily to attend a round table conference. The report that he will discuss the Spanish issue with German Aviation Minister Goering and General Franco seems to have been verified. Mussolini, accompanied by Fascist Party Secretary Starace, arrived safely at the Calabria Hotel here this morning. When Mussolini's train arrived at Paola Station, 15,000 people paid their respects to him and shouted "Long live the Spanish National Army!" "Long live Mussolini!" Mussolini only stayed in Paola for a few minutes and exchanged greetings with the welcomers and local authorities before continuing his journey to Taormina, where he got off the train.

### Italian Reservists Called Up for Service; 250,000 People

(Rome) 250,000 reservists were called up for service today. (30th Associated Press)

### The Fall of Madrid is Not the Fault of the War; Britain and France Actually Connived at Aggression; The Crime of the Traitor is Unforgivable

(Moscow) The Pravda newspaper commented on the fact that the traitor Miaya and Casado sold Madrid to the rebel army, saying, "The fall of Madrid was not due to the defeat of the Republican army, but because it was sold out and assassinated. The Spanish Republic, which has no weapons or food and is under strict blockade, has resisted foreign fascist armies for nearly three years. Its ability to do so is entirely due to the great unity of the people who hate fascist oppression. The London organizers of the Madrid counter-revolutionary coup added fuel to the fire of the fascist intervention army, resulting in the fall of Madrid. Their attempt was to trade with the fascist aggressors at the cost of the red blood and suffering of the Spanish people. However, although British and French diplomats have consistently connived at the aggressors, the result is still a failure. London is now greatly alarmed, and Colonel Casado, the direct culprit of the Madrid rebellion, has fled. The progressive people of the world deeply hate this kind of traitor and his gang."

### German Women are Surplus, Thanks to the War

(Berlin) Berlin is now urgently needing to solve the "women's problem" like major capitals around the world. The most difficult thing here is that there are too many women. The German authorities are now trying to equalize the number of men and women here, but all kinds of methods have failed. According to statistics published by the local municipal authorities, the number of women in excess has more than doubled before the war. Because in recent years, boys have been five or six percent more than girls in the production of children throughout Germany, but as a result, the number of women is still more than the number of men. Officials believe that during the European War, a large number of men died in battle or were transferred to other places to engage in military service, so the number of women is higher than that of men in comparison, it is said.

### Chinese Air Force Displays Power in South China; Sinking Japanese Warships and Destroying Oil Depots; Guangdong Refugees Often Eat Tree Bark and Fruit to Fill Their Stomachs

Hong Kong Correspondence: In the Sino-Japanese war in South China, there have been no major battles between the two sides recently. However, the Chinese army takes advantage of the favorable weather and terrain. Although the troops have not yet taken the initiative to attack, they first send planes to fiercely bomb the Japanese army's positions, places where military supplies are stored, or air force bases. Over time, the Chinese Air Force has suddenly become active. In particular, the bombing of the Japanese oil depot on Sanzao Island, which belongs to Zhongshan, on the morning of the 17th of this month is the most memorable. Sanzao Island is very close to Zhongshan and Aodou. The Japanese army occupied the island as an air force base for attacking Guangdong before invading Guangzhou. After more than a year of operation, aircraft warehouses and roads around the island were built. In addition, armories and oil depots were built in remote areas. Recently, the above-mentioned institutions were detected by the Chinese Air Force. Suddenly, 28 bombers were sent on that morning, divided into several teams. Half of them were fighter planes, ready to deal with Japanese planes, while the bombers aimed at the military key points in the island from an altitude of 8,000 feet.

More than Ten Bombs Were Dropped. The Japanese planes on the island were caught off guard and could not take off. There was no way to fight back. When the ammunition exploded, the island's oil depot, granary, and military supply depot were all hit. For a time, flames shot into the sky, and the losses were numerous. At about 9 a.m. on the 20th of this month, 31 new-style light bombers and single-wing fighter planes of the Chinese Air Force were found in the airspace near Nansha Island, which belongs to Zhongshan County. About ten Japanese warships are usually gathered there, including one or two transport ships and about thirty motorboats, all of which are prepared for landing. The anchorage area is quite large, and Chinese planes dropped more than ten bombs at the gathering place of Japanese warships and boats. A Japanese gunboat was destroyed on the spot.

It Sank Immediately. Only the masts and smokestacks were exposed on the water. More than ten Japanese motorboats were also sunk. The Japanese navy's losses in that area were even greater than the previous time. In the evening, after the Chinese Air Force made the Japanese army feel terrified, it flew to Humen, the exit of the Japanese army to the sea, in the dim moonlight to investigate, hovering for about ten minutes. The Japanese army there fired more than ten anti-aircraft guns, but they were aimless. After the Chinese planes learned the truth, they launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army camp at the Shajiao Fort and the Japanese warships on the river. After the investigation, a shell hit the Shajiao artillery position, and four or five Japanese warships on the river were injured. The Chinese planes accomplished their mission and took advantage of the night to continue flying to Taiban Village near Conghua County. They detected that the newly built defensive works and the increased construction in Zengjiangxi near Lychee were all

Completely Destroyed. The Chinese planes safely withdrew. At this time, the spring rain is continuous and the war is still in a stalemate. The poor, old, weak, and unarmed people in the war zone are all suffering unspeakably. The price of rice in various counties near Guangzhou is one-fifth higher than last month. Usually, one yuan (Cantonese currency) can still buy seven pounds of rice, but now it can only buy four pounds. Recently, after Daliang, Shunde County, was occupied by the Japanese army, the price of rice in Chencun and Bijiang rose even higher. One yuan can only buy three pounds of rice. Because the Japanese army in Daliang has recently been besieged by guerrillas, the land and water transportation in dozens of nearby villages has been cut off. Refugees are now using taro and sweet potatoes as food, or even tree roots and fruit peels to fill their hunger. Therefore, taro, sweet potatoes, and the like are also worth more than two corners per pound. As for Chaozhou and Shantou in Dongjiang, the price of rice has not yet fallen.

### A Glimpse of Digging Jiang's Treasure Beside the Wangjiang Tower in Chengdu; Discovering Human Heads and Stone Carvings and Other Items

Chengdu Aviation News: The news that Zhang Xianzhong's sunken silver was being dug out from the Jinjiang River beside the Wangjiang Tower has caused a sensation throughout the city since the news was disclosed in various newspapers. Everyone on the streets and alleys, teahouses, and restaurants is talking about Zhang Xianzhong's actions in Sichuan 300 years ago. This unusual miracle, if silver can really be found, is indeed a more rare world wonder than the American "Five Blessings Coming to the Door." Therefore, the reporter gathered several colleagues yesterday morning, taking a half-believing attitude, and went to Shiniu Yan near the Wangjiang Tower to investigate whether this Jiang Treasure Digging for Silver incident was real or not. The crowds were endless along the way. Passing by the Yinshi Tower and the Zhenliu Bank, it was already full of men and women who were driven by curiosity.

The Zhangjia Living Buddha Was Also Among the People, and the fellow lamas were talking about right and wrong. A small sand island appeared in the dry river. There were dozens of prisoners with cloth signs on their backs working hard on the excavation work. The Jiang River branched out from the island and circled east. There were more than a dozen military police guarding the surrounding area, refusing entry to maintain order. There were also tents for the workers to live in. Two waterwheels were draining water from the excavated area to the outer river. After being allowed by the soldiers to take a small boat to the island, the design team leader, fortunately, belonged to the highest level, and instructed that there was a trench that had been excavated, which was about two zhang deep, and no abnormalities were found. Then, the strategy was changed, and another excavation was started across the river, and only five feet away

Four Human Heads Were Discovered. The university students from Sichuan University were then taken to the chemistry lab for testing. Then, dozens of red sandstone pieces, each four feet long and one and a half feet wide, were found with the characters "Zhang," "Tian," "Si," "Xia," and "Wang" on both ends, as well as Zhang Xianzhong's symbols for killing people. Below was tung oil ash stone and dead wood strips. The general opinion is that treasures or ancient tombs will be discovered in the future. According to relevant sources, the Jiang Treasure Event is briefly described in Chen Shao Xiang Lian Shu's Que Bilu, which recorded that after Zhang Xianzhong was defeated by Yang Zhan in Jiangkou, he decided to go to northern Sichuan and transfer the remaining gold and silver, cakes, and treasures of the Shu government to the Jiang Mian River, dig several levels of holes under it, cover it with wood and stone, kill all the pan workers, and then open the embankment and release water so that people could not find it. Now, the excavation of the Jiang Treasure has discovered the above-mentioned signs. If there are any new discoveries, the excavation will be intensified. This Jinjiang River Taotao Company was established by Ma Kunshan and others after years of Yang Bailu's 27 years of observation, transmission, and textual research, and was approved by the Executive Yuan and ordered by the Ministry of Finance to be transferred to the provincial government to order Ma et al. to handle it. If silver is indeed discovered in the future (the amount is of course unknown), it will be divided into 80% for the public and 20% for the company to handle relief work.

### The People of Pinghu Mourn the Martyrs Who Attacked the City

More Than 4,000 People Cried in Unison

Pinghu Correspondence: On January 20 and February 5, the Chinese army was ordered to attack Pinghu County twice. The martyrs Lu Xiehe, Yao Renrong, Song Fenyu, Zhou Xiusheng, Zhong Shaoyu, Yu Laohu, and others bravely fought for glory and risked attacking the city. Unfortunately, they died in the line of duty. The party, government, and military of Pinghu County and the people from all walks of life, considering the heroic sacrifice of Lu Martyrs and others, which is worth singing and weeping about, specially held a memorial meeting at the public sports field in Xincang Town a few days ago. More than 4,000 people attended. The county magistrate presided over the ceremony, offered wreaths, and reported the brief history of each martyr. The listeners were all moved. As for the family of the martyr, only Lu Xiehe's widow, who was about twenty years old, was present. When she bowed and spoke to the attendees, her eyes were red and swollen, and it is imaginable how deeply saddened she was. After the funeral was over, the original plan was to sing the memorial song and shout slogans. The onlookers gathered, and the road was blocked.

### The New Fourth Army's Year of Anti-Japanese War: Experiences and Lessons - Xiang Ying (4)

Changes in the Battle Situation in Jiangnan and its Development Trends

First, changes in the enemy's situation can be discussed from two aspects: one is military changes, and the other is political changes.

A. Military changes can also be divided into two stages: First, the situation in the Jiangnan war zone before June. Before June, the enemy's military was centered on Nanjing, with Wuhu and Zhenjiang as strongholds, two strategic base points, and two strategic forward positions. The enemy's forces were concentrated in these three strongholds, but the strength of each stronghold was not large. On the traffic lines of Nanjing-Shanghai, Nanjing-Wuhu, Nanjing-Hangzhou, national highways, and county towns or large towns on both sides of the traffic lines, only a small number of troops were stationed to maintain their transportation. Before June, the enemy's traffic could proceed smoothly without any severe attacks or obstacles. The enemy could control and rule everything with a small number of troops, and even three to five men could go to the nearby villages on both sides of the traffic line to rape and plunder, rarely being attacked. This means that before June, the enemy's rear traffic was very safe. The total strength of the three traffic strongholds was no more than three regiments. From Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Dangtu to Jiaohu, only two or more regiments were stationed regularly. Other strongholds had only a platoon or a squad of men. Precisely because the rear traffic was very safe, the enemy could transfer most of its forces to the northern war zone, concentrating on Huainan, Jinpu area, to attack Hefei and Xuzhou. This was the situation before June. But since our army entered the war zone, due to our active offensive and continuous attacks, the enemy's traffic has been frequently stagnant and obstructed, feeling threatened. In order to protect military strongholds and strategic hubs, the enemy had to counterattack us. At present, the enemy's troop deployment is different from before. Second, the current military deployment of the enemy. Currently, the enemy's forces are scattered and concentrated in two areas, one centered on Nanjing and the other based in Wuhu. The enemy's traffic lines can be said to be that all traffic arteries on the Nanjing-Shanghai line, every bridge, station, and corner of the road, have built strongholds and are stationed with troops. Needless to say, each stronghold concentrates considerable forces to guard it, and every small place has been constructed with fortifications as cover. We are shuttling back and forth between the enemy's strongholds. Now the enemy's movement or movement must be protected by force, and lightly few people dare to go down to the countryside. In total, there are two and a half to three divisions of the enemy in Jiangnan, one division centered on Wuhu, one division centered on Nanjing, and one brigade centered on Zhenjiang. In addition, more than 5,000 puppet troops from North China and Manchuria have been added. The enemy's deployment is more rigorous. This is a major change in the enemy's military deployment, and this is the result of our arrival in the Jiangnan area.

B. Political trends. The enemy's political trends can also be divided into three periods. The first period is before June. 1. The Japanese army's burning, killing, and raping in the Jiangnan area are widespread phenomena, using power to suppress the Chinese people and make them submit. 2. The guerrillas have very bad discipline. The Japanese use this phenomenon to incite the people's feelings against the guerrillas. They say that the guerrillas are disrupting peace and order, and the Imperial Army is fighting the guerrillas. These facts have been used to confuse the Chinese people and have achieved considerable results. 3. The use of double-dealers to establish its rule. The double-dealers are: when the Japanese army comes, they set off firecrackers to welcome them and get some women to comfort the Imperial Army; when the Chinese army comes, they also set off firecrackers. These double-dealers preside over everything, with no mutual violation with the Japanese invaders, attempting to survive in peace. 4. The guerrillas and the Japanese invaders have tacit understanding and do not fight each other. This phenomenon was very common in Jiangnan in the past, and it still exists in the eastern section of Nanjing and Shanghai. 5. Japan took advantage of the fact that after the Chinese army withdrew from Nanjing, no army remained in Jiangnan to fight, so there was no propaganda work. Japan could carry out arbitrary propaganda in China and use traitors to announce the news of the Japanese invaders' combat. This naturally depressed the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people in Jiangnan. This is Japan's first phase of political action (to be continued)

### Eight Traitors Executed by Firing Squad, Zhou Yuelou's Late-Life Disloyalty

Taixian Newsletter: Zhou Yuelou, an 83-year-old man from Shungangzhou Township, Zhenjiang County, was recently suspected of being a traitor and was executed by firing squad by the Chinese military to serve as a stern warning. Xinghua Newsletter: The traitors captured by various agencies in Xinghua, after being interrogated by the county government and admitting the facts, were reported to the provincial government for legal execution. Yesterday, instructions were received that Li Kekuan, Xie Jiuyu, Wang Xiaodai, and Lin Deguang, as well as Tian Yusheng, Bao Desheng, and Gan Junzhi, who were held in custody by the Eighty-Ninth Army, should be executed by firing squad. After receiving the order, the county government verified the identity of the criminals, tied them up, and sent them to Shengdang for execution by firing squad.

### Chiang Orders Jiangsu Provincial Government to Prevent Yellow River Flooding

Dianhua Newsletter: The Jiangsu Provincial Government received an order from Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission, stating that the breach in the Yellow River cannot be closed for the time being. In the future, the water势 flooding will cause serious loss of life. The provincial government should immediately instruct the counties in the flood-affected areas to contact and handle the following matters before the Taofan this year: ① The flood scope and major embankments this year should be repaired, raised, and thickened as much as possible, so that the river channel can pass through the old trough and avoid increasing flooding. ② If the previous item is difficult to handle, then weirs should be built near each village to accommodate all the people of the village temporarily to avoid water and to store surplus grain. The height should be properly planned by the province according to the terrain and water勢, so that it will not be submerged during high water levels. ③ The existing water in the lower reaches should be drained. ④ Before gathering laborers for construction, the county government should teach workers to common sense of air defense. The above methods should also be notified to the counties and villages that have already fallen into enemy hands, so that they can pay attention to them together.

Education News

### Ministry of Education to Add a Department of Vocational Education; Provinces and Cities to Establish Vocational Education Sections; Counties to Establish Vocational Education Committees

(Chongqing Newsletter) Vocational education is particularly important in the current process of resisting Japan and building the country. The Ministry of Education attaches great importance to vocational education, but there is no special department to be in charge of it. In the past, it belonged to the Department of General Education. Education expert Jiang Wenyu believed that the country's entire education includes only three items: national education, talent education, and vocational education. The importance of vocational education can be seen. It seems appropriate to set up a special department to be responsible for promotion. He specifically suggested that the Ministry of Education add a Department of Vocational Education, provincial and municipal education bureaus set up vocational education sections, and counties set up vocational education committees to specialize in the matter, so as to assist in the war of resistance and national construction. The Ministry of Education also expressed its deep approval of this. The director of the Department of General Education is now jointly discussing the organizational regulations with the counselors. Once the draft is completed, it will be submitted to the evening meeting. After approval, it will be formally established.

### Hunan Province Plans to Establish the First United Middle School, Combining Seven Provincial Middle Schools and Five Attached Elementary Schools

(Hunan Newsletter) The Hunan Provincial Department of Education has decided that the Provincial Changsha Senior High School, Changsha Girls' High School, First Normal School, Senior Industrial Vocational School, Changsha Junior Industrial Vocational School, Changsha Women's First Vocational School, and Shaoyang Junior Metalworking and Chemical Vocational School, etc., have been approved by the provincial government meeting since the outbreak of the war of resistance. Zhu Jingnong was appointed as the chairman of the preparatory committee, Xiong Mengfei as the vice chairman, and Wu Huihua, Xiong Chongxu, Yang Guochu, Zhou Shengtang, and other principals of the provincial schools as members of the committee. School sites have been found in Anhua and Jialu cities. The area is located in the upper reaches of the Lian River, bordering the remaining veins of Hengshan Mountain. The environment is secluded and convenient for transportation from Changsha, Xiangtan, Yuanling, and other places. The junior high school normal school attached elementary school and other departments are located within three miles of Qiaotou City. The senior high school department is located in Qixing Street, twenty miles away from the city. The branch of the senior industrial department was originally located in Yongfeng, Xiangtan, and will be moved again if necessary. The junior vocational department is located in Lizhai, three miles away from the city. The administrative organization includes seven middle schools and five attached elementary schools. The faculty and staff are selected and hired from the original schools. The number of students in senior high school model junior high school boys and girls is estimated to be more than 1,800, which is merged from 40 classes into 30 classes. The branch of the senior industrial junior vocational school has about 600 students, and the attached elementary school students total more than 4,000, which is unprecedented in the education field of Hunan. Enrollment procedures have begun, and the monthly expenses amount to 12,000 gold. In order to plan for emergencies, the provincial government has been specially requested to issue self-defense rifles, and a squad of well-trained students will be selected and compiled by military instructors to serve as guards.

### Wu Zhihui's Lecture: Educational Issues in the Eyes of a Layman (4) Strict Management is the Only Way to Avoid Failure; In Times of National Crisis, Frugality Must be Exemplified

What's the danger of teaching too much advanced theory? Because too much advanced theory is very useful for the first aspect of good, and people who are good at the second point will definitely know that it is natural, but they may not know why, and there may be little to help him implement it. Therefore, if the work is too busy, it is better to meet Yan Yuan, a disciple of Confucius who does not reach benevolence in March, and occasionally talk about it. In addition, it is also quite necessary to save energy and be a Confucius who rarely speaks about life and benevolence. If you talk too much to people below the average of 65, it will not only be a waste of effort, but also create danger. The best result is the insight of Gao Hanlin in "The Scholars", who believes that having been hungry and having been drowned is just a matter of education in the class book, and there is no need to implement it. Because Mr. Ji is in charge of improving farmland, how can one starving person in the world be counted as him starving him? Mr. Yu is in charge of water conservancy projects, how can one drowning person in the world be counted as him drowning him? Isn't the theory too high? Although Gao Hanlin's position is a Hanlin, his personality is probably below the average, so he naturally doesn't understand it. However, he copied this topic from the education section and wrote it in the eight-legged essay, and the Hanlin was deceived by him. This is just a small danger. There is also a group of big politicians who recite slogans fluently, with national interests and people's happiness on their lips. Sometimes you find out that they are unreliable and feel very annoying, and you are wasting your time in vain. However, when you are in need, you listen to him saying that it is like a real price. If you are not careful, even a position higher than the Hanlin will be deceived by him. It is difficult to get a Shao Zhengmao, and Confucius painfully executed him. I am afraid there are still many small Shao Zhengmaos, and Confucius also feels that it is impossible to execute them all, so he only talks about nature and the way of heaven, which cannot be heard every day. Pay attention to your words, so as not to be stolen by this group of people and add capital for them to do evil in higher grades. As for having to say something so that, it is better to enrich it with culture and restrain it with ritual. Restraint has two meanings: one is to restrain and raise the ritual in the enrichment of culture, and the other is to restrain Dong'er and tell him not to move improperly or speak improperly. It is also necessary to manage him in education. Is it not safe to manage it? Confucius could not say anything about management to the Asian sage Yan Yuan, so now what kind of movement is too polite. It is better to change the movement to management for the matters that must be done in this way and must not be done in that way, which will be much more effective.

Add a management character to the education character of education to make the education character effective. Moreover, management requires more effort than education, which is also a natural trend. For example, when we set up officials, there is only one Ministry of Education in charge of education, while the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Civil Service, and the Ministry of Audit, which are in charge of management, require four. Speaking of this, the teaching and management are roughly explained. I think that the raising and connection things of the nurturing character, although it is inevitable to be regarded as physical, the effort is worth spending a lot, it seems that it is more important than management and teaching, because the nurturing and defense are not sufficient, the management and teaching will definitely be reduced, even if a person's ability is not sufficient, the spirit will inevitably be greatly affected, so it can also be compared to the setting up of officials, for management and teaching, it is the five departments of education internal affairs justice civil service audit, for the three departments of nurturing art, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economy, and the Ministry of Military Administration, although only three departments are set up, is the cost spent not more than the five departments? However, this childish comparison is unavoidable laughable, but if I spend half of my effort to make you all noisy for three hours, I am afraid you will have to pay great attention to it. It is a pity that you have spent your noble time for nearly an hour and a half now. How can you make it for another three hours? It is better to talk about it when there is a chance.

There are only a few summary words. In our past education, there was education but no nurturing, so we ate a big education in this war of resistance. We also did not pay attention to the management character, and secretly changed the national education into religious education. Although there are people on the surface, it has created many literati, but how many can be generals and ministers, analyze Wei Zunzu, and most of them are monks chanting scriptures. Therefore, there is still a layman named Niu Tongzheng, who said to me in February last year that he was afraid that the characters in our school were no different from the lamas in the Mongolian temple, and only became a higher class in society. It is no different for us to send our children to school than for Mongolia to have three sons and want two to be lamas. I was very amused by his metaphor. That day, I ran to the Confucius Pond and heard the sound of reading inside a primary school. I thought that this was the group of little lamas again. Just as a teacher came out, he recognized me and wanted to invite me in to give a lecture. I was holding this bizarre idea, what could I say when I went in? I politely declined and said goodbye. We laymen have this kind of feeling. You all listen to it, smile bitterly, and scold us. Let you all deal with it. (End)

### Chief Chen Responds to Chu Minyi, Agreeing that Chinese Martial Arts Should Participate in the World Games; Preparation, Training, and Selection Work Will Be Prepared in Chongqing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai

The 12th World Games will be held in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, next year. Chu Minyi previously suggested to the Ministry of Education to send a Chinese martial arts troupe to the meeting for performance. He sent a nurturing telegram to the Minister of Education, Dai Jitao, Wang Rutang, etc., roughly meaning that the Chinese Sports Association held a meeting in Chongqing, and our country has decided to participate in the World Games. Mr. Wang Rutang was publicly elected as the general team leader, and at least two teams of football and basketball went to the meeting. It seems that Chinese martial arts should not be neglected. Recalling the results of our country's participation in the Berlin World Games last time, all kinds of competitions fell behind. Fortunately, there was a performance of Chinese martial arts, which was welcomed by foreigners and won a lot of glory. This session should pay special attention to it, and the scope of organization and athletes should be expanded compared with the last session, and the quality should be more refined. Preparations should be started immediately, and true talents should be selected in Chongqing, Hong Kong, and Shanghai at the same time, in order to obtain international honors. Now I know that Chu has received a reply from Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education, expressing his deep approval of the suggestions, and has transferred the letter to the preparatory committee for the 12th World Games for reference. It is also heard that Chu will actively engage in the preparation, training, and selection work based on his long-cherished ambition to promote Chinese martial arts.

### West League Football C Group Champion Undecided, A Group Donghua Runner-up, Yesterday's Meeting Decided

The Shanghai Western Football Association held an executive committee meeting at its clubhouse on Nanjing Road at 5 pm yesterday to discuss closing matters. Many executives attended. As a result of the meeting, the champions of the cup competition have been determined and there is nothing to discuss. However, in terms of the league, neither group A nor group C has been able to complete all the matches, so the champion has not been produced. After discussion, the champion of Group A was decided to be calculated according to the first cycle, so the championship belongs to the Four Fords. According to this calculation, Donghua is in the group with 10 points, ranking second, and West Bu is in third place with 9 points. French merchants have one less game and are followed by 8 points and Kex. The bottom is Zhen Dan. In the B-group league, the chief of the British Navy is undoubtedly, and in the C-group, there are too many unfinished battles, and the champion has not been resolved.

### Finance: Cash Prices Turn from Falling to Rising

Changes Remain Small

Only Seven Yuan Fluctuations

Yesterday's Shanghai Gold Market conditions were slightly more volatile than the previous day. The situation was initially weak, then turned firm, entirely dependent on buying and selling. Initially, the situation was weak due to selling by gold shops and silver houses. Later, due to successive purchases by securities firms and money exchange businesses, and the slight tightening of foreign exchange at the time, confidence gradually improved, and prices gradually firmed up, closing at the highest price of the day, 2082 yuan. As a result, prices rebounded by five yuan. However, trading remained sluggish, with only over 300 taels transacted throughout the day. Silver shop jewelry prices remained at the original levels, while customs gold remained stable. Chinese and English pure gold, etc., rose slightly.

Shanghai Gold Market Up Five Yuan

From the morning, each ten taels opened with scarce supply and demand, leading to no trading for a long time. It was not until after 10 o'clock that a certain silver shop sold 50 taels to a gold shop at an opening price of 2077 yuan, with no change compared to the previous day's afternoon close. It was rumored that money exchange businesses traded 50 taels mutually at 75 yuan and 5 jiao. Later, a silver shop sold 20 taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 75 yuan. Before long, a securities firm and a money exchange business suddenly competed to buy on behalf of customers, so the market stopped weakening and stabilized. The securities firm bought 90 taels from the gold shop at a price of 77 yuan. Following this, a certain money exchange business also bought 50 taels from the gold shop at the same price. After this, the money exchange business still wanted to buy, but the gold shop's willingness to sell weakened, so supply and demand reached a standoff again. At 11:15, a money exchange business bought 50 taels from another money exchange business at 80 yuan, acting as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, supply and demand became clear again. Only the silver shop bought 50 taels from the gold shop at a price of 82 yuan. Later, there were buyers but no sellers at the opening price, making it difficult to trade. Therefore, the evening close was still 2082 yuan. As a result, prices rebounded by five yuan compared to the previous day's noon close. The selling price of cash shop's own brand gold was 2090 yuan, and the purchase price was 2075 yuan. The current bid gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no trading.

Jewelry Gold Still Unchanged

The exchange price of silver shop jewelry per tael has not changed, as the Shanghai gold market has been stable. Datongxing still lists 211 yuan, and Xintongxing lists 209 yuan, with a purchase price of 203 yuan.

Pure Gold Up Half a Penny

London, 29th - Due to the recent weakening of the British pound, the price of English pure gold has also increased by half a penny per ounce, reaching £7 8s 6d. As a result, the central bank's current purchase price of Chinese gold has also increased to 1212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed price of customs gold has not changed, remaining at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard bid gold price has also increased by 4 jiao, reaching 1207 yuan and 6 jiao.

Mixed Changes in Foreign Currencies

Yesterday, English pure gold rose by half a penny, and the English-American exchange rate fell by 125. In the local foreign exchange market, settlements by foreign firms were strong. Fortunately, Hong Kong telegraphs and foreign banks provided supplies, maintaining market stability. However, due to the decline in the English-American exchange rate, the result was that English was stable and American was tight. The Shanghai gold market opened weakly, but after days of decline, confidence improved, and retail investors took advantage of the low prices to buy, boosting the weak market. However, actual transactions still felt sluggish, and market prices continued to be stable. Foreign currencies such as English and American gold pounds had slight sales, while English and American gold bills were in high demand. Foreign banks continued to buy, and the supply was still smooth. The rise and fall of each currency were mixed. Trading by the association was not strong. Changtai sold and Xiangkang bought 40 pounds of English gold bills. Hongchang sold and Xiangkang bought 30 pounds of English gold bills. Dongtai sold and Tongfeng bought 500 yuan of American gold bills. Yesterday's market prices: French gold bills fell by 1 fen, American gold bills rose by 3 li, Hong Kong bills fell by 5 li, French franc bills fell by 2 hao and 5 fen, ruble bills rose by 5 li, Canadian bills rose by 3 fen, Philippine bills rose by 1 fen, German gold bills rose by 1 jiao, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### Frequent Falls in the Hong Kong Exchange Market

### Rumors of Hong Kong Dollar Devaluation; Hong Kong Exchange Selling Spree; Sudden Increase in Demand for American Exchange

The exchange market yesterday saw increased settlements by major foreign firms, and foreign banks (excluding HSBC) also saw more inflows than outflows. In addition, Hong Kong telegraphs also stopped selling, so the English gold once tightened to a settlement price of only eight pence and 21875 for foreign firms. Later, relying on HSBC's maintenance, it stabilized. The American exchange, due to the trend of English-American exchange rates, had been weakening for two days, so foreign banks were reluctant to sell, resulting in a slight tightening of 0.03125. Trading was quite active throughout the day. The Hong Kong exchange was initially slightly soft due to foreign firms' settlements. Afterwards, Reuters suddenly reported that the Hong Kong currency would be devalued, so selling soared, and the situation turned from tight to hard, ultimately loosening by 125.

In the morning, the London big bar recently narrowed by 0.0625, while the long-term remained stable. New York silver prices also remained unchanged. London raw gold was mostly a penny, the exchange rate was seven hao less for English versus American, three cents less for versus French, and unchanged for versus Shanghai. American versus English fell by 125, unchanged for versus French, and narrowed by seven fen for versus Shanghai. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning selling prices were: English exchange at eight pence and 25, American exchange at 16 yuan and 09175, both unchanged from the previous close. After the opening, a certain bank and foreign banks competed to purchase English gold, but fortunately HSBC made every effort to maintain it, so the situation was stable. A certain bank and various foreign banks settled HSBC's English exchange (April) at eight pence and 25. HSBC's listed price was announced to be unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to be slightly more than half a cent, calculated at 4.00%. After this, foreign firms also settled both English and American gold, but the English exchange remained unchanged under HSBC's maintenance, while the American exchange was slightly tight because the bank's willingness to sell was not smooth. Foreign firms settled Dufeng's English exchange at eight pence and 25, and purchased a certain bank's American exchange at 16 yuan and 0625. Near noon, foreign firms also absorbed Dutch Hong Kong exchange at 55 yuan and 25, and the situation was also slightly tight. At the noon close, the bank's selling prices were: English exchange at eight pence and 25, American exchange at 16 yuan and 0625.

In the afternoon, Shoushan Youli settled HSBC's English exchange at eight pence and 25. Following this, a foreign firm settled Youli's Dutch English exchange at eight pence and 12875, and the situation was slightly soft. Later, a foreign firm purchased a certain bank's American exchange at 16 yuan and 0625. At that time, Reuters suddenly reported that the Hong Kong currency would be devalued, so those selling Hong Kong exchange surged, causing the situation to loosen. Foreign firms Anda and Holland sold Hong Kong exchange to foreign firms at 55 yuan and a half. At the evening close, the bank's selling prices were: English exchange at eight pence and 25, American exchange at 16 yuan and 025. As a result, compared to the previous day, the English was stable, the American was tight by 0.03125, and the Hong Kong exchange was uniquely loose by 125. The day's transactions are recorded below:

English Exchange (calculated per National Currency yuan)

Bought Price Sold

American Bank Youli (April) Eight pence and 25 HSBC

Youli Eight pence and 25 HSBC

Foreign Firm Eight pence and 21875 Youli Holland

American Exchange (calculated per 100 National Currency yuan)

### Discount Rate Enters the Fifty Yuan Level

Yesterday's discount rate for exchange bills continued to fall slightly, entering the 50 yuan level. It was initially 50 yuan per thousand yuan, then slightly fell, reaching 49 yuan, 7 jiao, and half a cent at noon. In the afternoon, it once fell as low as 49 yuan and a half, and finally rebounded slightly, still at 49 yuan, 7 jiao, and half a cent, which was 2 jiao and a half lower than the previous day.

### Slight Narrowing of the Recent Big Bar

London, 29th - The silver market was extremely stable and peaceful, and trading was also clear. After the close, there were buyers at the listed price, but sellers had to add 0.0625. The recent big bar narrowed by 0.0625, while the long-term remained stable. Also, according to New York, American spot prices remained unchanged. Also, according to Bombay, the Indian silver market was calm, and both spot and futures prices remained unchanged.

### Securities: Public Debt Lacks Excitement

Although Buyers are Lacking, It's Only Slightly Better

The securities off-market was extremely quiet yesterday. Initially, confidence seemed slightly excited, because vague and confusing peace news had suddenly emerged internationally. However, whether it was a temptation or a smokescreen, our country's fixed national policy would certainly not be tested or shaken in the slightest. Therefore, market prices still did not show any good signs. Judging from the recent sluggish market conditions, trading was depressed. Whenever trading is prosperous, it must be due to absorption from various parties, which shows that the number of chips circulating on the table is very scarce. In recent months, most of the goods gradually collected by the financial community have been transferred from scattered retail investors. Therefore, there are still few major sellers. Looking at yesterday's transactions, Runli, Hengfu, Dafeng, and No. 7 bought in the morning, while No. 14 and No. 38, as well as Tongkang and Renchang, sold. Market prices rose slightly by one or two jiao. Trading was extremely clear in the afternoon. Xieda, Runli, and Shunxiang sold slightly, while No. 4, No. 38, and Defu collected slightly. The situation was extremely quiet, mostly a sideways market. As a result, market prices only improved slightly by one jiao to one jiao and a half. The total transaction volume was about 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:

Slight Trading in Water and Electricity Stocks

Stock Market Conditions: Over 70 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity Company preferred stock were traded at a price of 6 yuan and 5 jiao.

Far East Bank Stocks Continue to Fall

London, 29th (Wednesday) - The listed market prices of Far East companies' stocks owned by British businesses showed continued declines in bank stocks, while others remained unchanged. Jardine Matheson Bank stocks continued to fall by 2 shillings and 6 pence, with the price at £8 10 shillings. HSBC London registered stocks continued to fall by half a pound, with the price at £82 and a half. Also, Hong Kong registered stocks also fell by one pound, with the price at £84.

Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bonds Rise by One Pound

London, 29th (Wednesday) - Among Chinese foreign currency bonds, in addition to the Anglo-German continued loan Anglo-issued bonds falling another pound and a half, with the price at £73, the three types of Rehabilitation, Longhai, and Beijing-Shanghai slightly rose. The Anglo-issued debt of the Rehabilitation public debt and the printed debt of the Longhai Railway each rose by half a pound, with the former priced at £52 and the latter priced at £18. The price of Beijing-Shanghai Railway Company stock rose by one pound, with the price at £26, while the rest remained unchanged. London's supply of goods for sale included £15,000 of the Huguang Railway public debt, German-issued, printed, and winning bonds, with a selling price of £22 and a half, half a pound less than the listed price of unwinning tickets.

Gonghexing Stock Sees High Price

The Public Industry Association reported that the Shanghai foreign stock market suddenly tended towards chaotic phenomena today. However, various high-quality public bonds had special demand, and there was a huge transaction volume in electric power bonds, with a price of 91 yuan and 5 jiao, and buyers continued to be smooth. Gonghexing tram and tap water stocks (both with interest) were not lacking in demand, and Gonghexing stock saw its high price of 207 yuan and 5 jiao again. There was no shortage of cash in the market, and there were those who demanded profits, but they were slightly hindered by the still uncertain European situation and did not dare to invest. Jardine Matheson stocks were slightly weak, and rubber stocks were also weak.

### Yarn and Cotton: Large Players Are Still Dragging in on Dips, Causing Yarn Prices to Fluctuate; 20-Count Yarn Feels the Pressure of Over-Supply

The yarn market, after a major fall, has entered a sideways trend, but confidence has improved slightly. Most of the floating goods in the hands of general traders have been cleared. Large players with sufficient strength remain firm in their attitude, and not only do they not spit out the absorbed goods, but they also come to pull up prices when they are low, so a step can be temporarily stabilized. However, actual sales are still as deserted as ever due to the impact of traffic disruptions. Only 10-count coarse yarn is still wanted by Tianjin agents, so the market is slightly bullish, but they also dislike the high price, and yesterday it also turned cold. However, stocks are lacking, but 20-count yarn still feels the pressure of over-supply, and the business that is done is temporary in nature, so it fluctuates up and down from time to time.

The current yarn situation: At the opening in the morning, fellow traders gathered to discuss, and most people said that although business was small, the price had fallen greatly, and there might be a possibility of temporary stabilization, so there were fewer floating goods in the market, and the market was even more stable. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse was slightly lower by 5 jiao than the previous day's price, at 372 yuan. The Hong Kong gang traded 80 bales. After a while, actual demand was still sluggish, and many scattered sellers spat out, returning to a small 1 yuan and a half, with the lowest price at 370 yuan. After the price fell, some people came to buy again, and many came to collect again, and it immediately turned upwards, still to 372 yuan. In the afternoon, the market was not very changeable due to the rain and the scarcity of people attending the meeting. In general, it was a wavering path. As a result, it was found that the various gangs bought a total of 1,085 bales throughout the day. The market price of 20-count Double Horse Sky Maiden was slightly weaker by 5 jiao, and Shepherd was not very different from the previous day. The rest fell by about 1 yuan. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed separately below:

The Japanese yarn market is still good, and actual demand has not improved much, but most people are optimistic and say that the future looks good. The current price of 20-count Water Moon yarn is 342-3 yuan, and the price of 20-count Blue Phoenix is 331-2 yuan.

### High Price Attracts Zhaoyuan Customers; Tongzhou Fine Velvet Flows in Continuously

The business of local cotton has turned weak, and the factories have not taken any action, mainly because the cotton yarn market is weak, resulting in a lack of enthusiasm. However, fellow traders' transactions of delivering early shipments are still continuous, but the amount is very small, so market prices have fallen again. The selling price of Tongzhou cotton has fallen by more than half a yuan compared to the previous day, and the fire engine cotton has also fallen by 2 jiao and a half. As for the source, along the Subei route, due to the high prices in Shanghai, general traders raise funds and take risks to ship goods. High prices attract Zhaoyuan customers, so the arrival of goods has been smooth recently. If they arrive in Shanghai smoothly, the profits will be unimaginable. 1,539 bales of Tongzhou fine velvet cotton arrived at the pier, and 300 pieces of Qidong cotton arrived. The prosperity of current cotton sales and the amount are listed on the left.

### Japanese Factories Purchase Brazilian Cotton; Yesterday's Transactions Reached a Huge Volume of 16,000 Bales; U.S. Cotton Exports Reach Subsidy Levels; Southern Opposition

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: In the New York cotton market, due to Roosevelt's endorsement of cotton export subsidies, Southern congressmen held a meeting and strongly opposed the export subsidy, especially Smith. Therefore, the cotton market was very chaotic. However, according to Roosevelt, the release of loan cotton and the appropriation of export subsidies, this year's new cotton and the Cotton Loan Act will remain effective. As a result, near-term prices fell by six British points, while long-term prices rose by eight or nine British points. Yesterday, the Indian market was closed, and it was predicted to fall by one and a half rupees. Egypt fell by twenty British points. Yesterday, the exchange rate was slightly tight, and the converted cotton price in legal currency still fell. U.S. cotton and Brazilian cotton fell by 4 jiao and a half per dan, Indian cotton fell by 2 jiao and a half, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 1 yuan.

Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was very quiet, and no transactions were heard from Chinese factories. However, Japanese factories purchased Brazilian cotton very strongly yesterday, totaling about 16,000 bales. The water freight for Brazilian goods arriving in China is also very scarce. The Brazilian cotton ordered yesterday will not arrive until July or August. Yesterday, the purchasers of Brazilian cotton included Gongda 4,000 bales, Donghua 3,000 bales, Tongxing 3,000 bales, Shanghai Factory 2,000 bales, Yufeng and Toyota 1,500 bales each, and Neiwaichang 1,000 bales. The foreign cotton prices calculated yesterday are as follows:

Raw Material Category Delivered to Factory Including Tax

### Piece Goods: Finished Dyed Cloth; Sales in the Southwest Are Improving; Tianjin Agents Actively Purchase Eastern Piece Goods

National Cloth Finished Dyed Goods: Plain cloth and blue cloth twill are seeing renewed sales in the Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong regions. Sichuan agents are purchasing over 2,000 pieces of plain cloth, poplin, plain fine twill, fine cloth, colored cloth, and printed piece goods for transshipment to Yunnan. Yunnan agents are purchasing over 2,200 pieces of Shilin cloth, colored twill, poplin, striped plain printed colored satin, etc. The remaining amount of previously ordered goods is still huge and is being reported for loading one after another. Guangdong agents are adding goods, with the western region being more prosperous. Over 3,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, plain cloth, and plain twill are being newly purchased in Nanning, Leizhou, Mazhang, and other places. However, the purchase demand for white goods is very thin, only related to the local dyeing business, purchasing over 100 pieces of fine twill and fine cloth. The coarse cloth market continues to be soft, and local sales are scattered. Local agents are reselling hand goods at loose prices, and the market is in a slump. However, finished dyed cloth is selling strongly in the southwest, and local retail and wholesale are also very prosperous. Therefore, the market is firm, and sellers with scarce goods are raising prices.

Eastern Piece Goods: The actual sales of white goods fine cloth, fine twill, and local customers continue to be strong. The price of scarce dyed blanks has been raised by another 5 fen per piece. Due to the activity in Niuzhuang on the northern route, and the shortage and high prices of goods in Tianjin, Tianjin agents are absorbing goods strongly, purchasing 600 to 700 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill of various brands. Local dyeing factories are again purchasing over 1,000 pieces of colored twill and colored cloth for futures due to the smooth sales of colored twill and colored cloth. The highest bid for Longtian fine twill has been sold at 12 yuan and 1 jiao. Foreign firms are opening 300 pieces of fine cloth, 12-pound colored ball at 12 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 fen and a half per piece, Flying Fish at 12 yuan, 2 jiao, and a half, and Five Blessings at 12 yuan and 9 fen.

Exports: Yesterday, 250 pieces were shipped to Ningbo, and today another 220 pieces are being shipped to Tianjin.

### Foodstuffs: Over 40,000 Bags of Foreign Flour Newly Arrived; Local Flour Mill Prices Repeatedly Fall Secretly; Northern Merchants Selling for Only $4.30

The market for spot flour from factories is in a continuous slump because sales channels to merchants are gradually becoming quiet. Southern merchants have not been moving large quantities for a long time. After the factory prices for Northern merchants were specially reduced, entire batches have been traded. However, recently, flour prices in Tianjin have also fallen due to the influence of foreign flour. Furthermore, there is a shortage of ship space in Shanghai, and goods being handled cannot be loaded and shipped. Therefore, new transactions have sharply decreased, and special price reductions are being considered before deals can be accepted. Factories and merchants are at a standstill, but as a result, the factories, forced by circumstances, have been sacrificing profits and repeatedly lowering prices. It is heard that "Battleship Brand" has fallen to $4.35, and "Artillery Brand" is only opening at $4.30, but the factories are unwilling to publicly announce these prices because the selling prices are not consistent with those in this street and to Southern merchants. In the formal market, the price remains at $4.45 with exchange rate included. The flour market is greatly affected by the dumping of foreign flour. Although prices have gradually decreased, it is feared that it will be difficult to establish a foothold in the future. Regarding the import and export of flour, there are 2,500 bags coming from Hong Kong and transshipped to Qingdao, another 8,500 bags also coming from Hong Kong and transshipped to Yantai, and another 3,000 bags transshipped to Tianjin.

The foreign flour market is also softening. Besides past orders arriving, it is heard that the Gongli Foreign Firm has a newly arrived shipment of over 40,000 bags. It is reported that this ship entered port on the 28th, and current inventory is increasing daily. Adding to this, local flour is repeatedly decreasing in price to compete, so foreign flour currently held in hand by firms is being sold in the market, with prices falling from $4.30 to $4.20 (cash). However, actual transactions by local merchants are not as prosperous as in the previous two days. Therefore, yesterday, the entire batch trading felt lacking and secretly the foreign flour prices has dropped quickly for 10 cents.

The wheat market is also seemingly stable but secretly loosening. Because flour prices have been falling for several days, the foreign wheat that various factories had previously ordered is arriving successively. Therefore, factories are consistently taking a wait-and-see attitude, and customers also find the prices too high. Although the supply of local wheat is currently scarce, the environment already feels unfavorable. It is heard that the secret price has fallen below $7, but official transactions remain firm.

### Silk and Tea: Factory Silk in Hand, Eager to Sell

Overseas silk markets are still stable. New York silk prices have not changed. Exchange prices are up 2.5 cents in the near term, Yokohama forward contracts are up 9 yuan, and spot is up a small 5 yuan. Lyon silk prices have not moved. Shanghai factories are still observing through foreign firms, but those with inventory in hand are eager to sell, so the market sentiment seems to be weakening. Prices from French firms are still slightly lower. Only 30 dan of 16-18 and 18-20 stripe patterns were traded. Local firms opened at $1670, and Yangzi firms haggled at $1680. Domestic sales are still sluggish. Yesterday, a silk factory purchased several dozen dan of Chefoo silk at $920.

### Du Geng (Rice) Sellers Have Strong Mentality

Buyers Turn Cold

Rice Shops Openly Increase Price by 40 Cents

Yesterday, the supply from various merchants only included No. 15 from Hexia. Carload shipments from other places did not arrive at all, so sellers' mentality was quite firm. The morning market calls were especially high. However, shops on this street, after moving rice the day before, resumed taking a wait-and-see attitude. Speculators also rarely inquired, so the situation was flat, and the market presented a standstill between the two sides. As a result, the prices of rice, whether thick or thin, barely held firm. In reality, rice such as the Hexia cargo was already softening somewhat. In short, reviewing the market over the past week, it has been high and low at times, and the situation has not deviated from a gyrating state. Prices of various rice types such as Du, Yang, Jian, and Yuan have not changed.

Checking rice import and export, there are 3,797 bags coming from Hong Kong and transshipped to Qingdao, and another 3,500 bags also coming from Hong Kong and transshipped to Tianjin.

Regarding retail rice prices, yesterday, the rice merchants officially announced a break from past restrictions. Under the guise of commission, transportation, and miscellaneous fees, an additional 40 cents in legal tender will be added per stone, effective April 1. They still claim to maintain the limited price while considering the people's food supply. In reality, it is merely turning the secret into the open, which shows that the rice industry's so-called maintenance of limited prices is nothing more than window dressing.

### High-Grade Foreign Rice Unwilling to Sell Lightly; Ordinary Ke Xian Mediocre

After Ke Xian rice was actively digested by the street the previous day, merchants and speculators took the opportunity to try to sell, so yesterday morning, after a period of bustle and an upward trend, it turned back to a standstill. However, Yang Jian and foreign rice on the market were both quite firm. Ke Xian transactions still amounted to 3,000 piculs, mostly handled by various households in the street. Merchants and speculators did not engage in much business. Market conditions were not significantly different from the previous market. Only ordinary goods appeared slightly mediocre. High-grade foreign rice is still opening around $17, but the "Pagoda Brand" owned by foreign firms, because of its higher quality, is unwilling to lightly sell at market price, so it is calling for a price that is 30 to 40 cents higher.

### Oil Market: Soybean Oil Rises and Falls Depending on Dalian Market; Raw Oil Sales Stagnant, Showing Fatigue

The key to the rise and fall of soybean oil is still inseparable from the manipulation and constraints of Dalian. Yesterday morning, the Dalian telegram started rising and ended falling, causing the hearts of the people in this city to change three times in one day. The opening rose by 20 to 30 cents, then fell midway, and fell more than half of the previous increase. In the end, it moved forward again. The reason is that the future oil thrown by Japanese merchants seems to be gradually absorbed by Mitsui and Sanwa Foreign Firms under the circumstances that the slots are insufficient for commercial transport. Because the futures market is higher than the spot price, the market yesterday, besides spot oil, was entirely speculation among merchants. It is estimated that 150 pieces of Yantai oil were traded at $23.90, 30 large baskets of Lianqi oil at $30.08, and 200 pieces for April delivery at $30.70 and $30.75. 50 barrels of current Dalian oil at $33.25, 50 barrels loaded in late March at $33.25, and over 1,000 barrels for April delivery at $33.35 to $33.15. 600 barrels for May delivery at $33.30 to $33.10.

The weakness of the raw oil market has become apparent because sales are limited and there is no supply coming. It is heard that Qingdao has decided to release 6,000 pieces successively, so the market is again showing signs of disintegration. Fortunately, the market did not suffer too much in the rising tide of soybean oil. The market only fell by 20 cents yesterday. 20 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at $28.20, and 500 cans of Yantai canned oil were traded at $37.

### Coal: Sparse Transactions of Indian Coal

Merchants are observing Indian bituminous coal and there are no wholesale transactions. Dealers are also unwilling to easily sell because of the high cost, resulting in a standstill. Although a certain firm had some sparse business yesterday, it was moving slowly. No. 1 Indian lump coal opened at $42 per ton, No. 2 at $40, and lower-grade fines at $41, with dealers handling their own transportation. Customers add another $4 for transport.

### Shanghai Public Concession Court Agreement Continues in Effect After Today's Expiration Because Neither Party Intends to Cancel or Revise

The Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Court Agreement was signed on February 17 of the 19th year of the Republic of China by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Great Britain, the United States, France, Netherlands, and Brazil. After being extended repeatedly for three years, it expires again on the 31st of this month. According to the agreement, if either party wishes to cancel, it should notify the other party six months before the expiration date, otherwise it should continue in effect. It is heard that although the agreement has expired, because neither party has notified cancellation or revision, it should naturally continue in effect. It is heard that the original agreement has a total of ten articles and attachments. According to the provisions of Article 10, "This agreement and its associated exchanged notes shall take effect on April 1, 1930, and shall continue in effect for three years from that date. Its term may be extended upon mutual agreement between the two parties at the expiration." This agreement expired on March 31 of the 22nd year, and was extended for three years with the consent of both parties. It expired again on March 31 of the 25th year and was extended again for three years until today (i.e., March 31 of the 28th year).

### Ningbo Defense Command Permits Free Export of Goods

No Need to Apply for Transport Permits

Strictly Prohibit Transport of Materials Aiding the Enemy to Shanghai

According to shipping industry news, because enemy materials and the Zhejiang Customs have received orders from the Ministry of Finance to handle the prohibition of transport, the previous order from the Ningbo Defense Command that goods leaving the Yong River must obtain transport permits is no longer necessary. However, to prohibit the import of enemy goods and restrict the sale of foreign goods, all goods entering and leaving the port will still be handled in accordance with the prescribed measures. This case has been reported to and approved by Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Huang Jing through secret telegram No. 2. It will be implemented from April 1. Thereafter, general goods should be allowed to be exported freely without needing to apply for transport permits. However, when shipping enemy materials to the Shanghai Concession, the regulations of the Ministry's "Review Measures for Transporting Enemy Materials to Shanghai" should be followed. The Customs will inspect and release the goods.

### Registration Procedures for Vessels on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line

Six Passenger Ships

Ten Cargo Ships

Since the resumption of direct navigation on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, the vessels traveling must be designated by the exporting merchants and approved by the Defense Command before entering the port. The Ningbo Defense Command has approved the first batch of registered vessels that have been certified as qualified by the Navigation Affairs Office. The list includes 16 vessels: Moufu, Deping, Ende, Tangsai, Meida, Xinan'na, Hana, Zhejiang, Yingzhou, Male, Haifu, Liangzhou, Libao, Gaodeng, Xin Beijing, and Shantay. It has been decided that starting from April 1, the Shipping Association will allocate routes to each vessel, schedule services, and sail according to schedule. There is no need for exporters to apply for each voyage. The Shipping Association has internally decided that six passenger ships—Deping, Moufu, Xin Beijing, Tangsai, Shantay, and Meida—will each enter the port six times a month, sailing between Shanghai and Ningbo once every five days. The remaining ten ships will serve as cargo ships, sailing according to the needs of cargo transport.

### Salt Transported from Fujian to Ningbo

Carried by the Xinfuzhou Vessel

Totaling 2,300 Tons

The Ningbo Defense Command recently telegraphed the Yin County Shipping Association, stating: "Received telegram from Commander-in-Chief Liu Yangwu Dezheng, stating: 'Director Guo Ma of the Salt Collection and Transportation Office telegraphed that, upon order, the Yihe Company's Xinfuzhou vessel, carrying 2,300 tons of Fujian salt, has been chartered by the Fujian Salt Affairs Bureau and is scheduled to set sail for Ningbo on the 26th. Upon investigation, this vessel has not yet been registered. It is hereby telegraphed for your approval. In consideration of the importance of salt transport and the urgency of the situation, please grant permission to notify the Ningbo Defense Command to implement it. If registration procedures need to be completed, they will be completed upon arrival of the vessel in Ningbo. Please also provide instructions, etc.' In addition to telegramming provisional approval for entry once, the regulations must be followed thereafter. It is specifically telegraphed for compliance." It is heard that the Yin County Shipping Association has complied accordingly.

### Puppet Fu Xiao'an Raises Unreasonable Demands Again, Separately Notifying the Consular Body and the Municipal Council, Actually Demanding to Take Over the First Special District Court

The "North China Daily News" reports: "According to sources revealed last night (29th), the 'Shanghai Mayor' under the 'Puppet Reformed Government,' Fu Xiao'an, yesterday sent the same note to Consul General and Leading Consul Nilon and Municipal Council Chairman Fankerling, demanding an immediate response to his note of March 10, which had not yet received a reply. Fu's previous note demanded the suppression of illegal elements in the Public Concession, the reopening of the 'Special Municipal Police Bureau's' Dafulu Branch, the return of the land bureau files left to the Municipal Council by the former Chinese administrative organs, the placement of the First Special District Court under the jurisdiction of the 'Special Municipal Government,' and the prohibition of displaying the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag in the Public Concession. Yesterday's note was delivered to Fankerling at 2:00 PM, demanding an 'immediate and clear response' on whether the Consular Body and the Municipal Council were 'prepared to cooperate with him,' and requesting these two administrative bodies to announce their views on transferring the First Special District Court to the 'New Municipal Government.' Fu also declared in his note that, after April 1, the 'Special Municipal Government' would consider any judgment of the First Special District Court in civil and criminal cases to be illegal. The agreements concluded between the relevant countries and the Chinese government regarding this court will expire on March 31. If the 'Special Municipal Government's' administration of the court is recognized, it is prepared to continue in effect. Fu also demanded immediate action on the other four demands made on March 10, giving the 'Special Municipal Government' a satisfactory answer to promote friendship and demonstrate cooperation."

### Rice Merchants Association Decides Retail Rice Prices to Increase Slightly; Few Arrivals, Firm Prices; Decided to Add 40 Cents Per Stone

The Shanghai Rice Merchants Association has repeatedly received letters from member rice shops, stating that since last month, rice prices have soared. The association has limited rice prices, with the highest grade of white rice not exceeding 14 yuan per stone. However, members must add fees for brokers and transportation to the limited price when purchasing rice from the rice market. Retail sales in stores cannot exceed the limited price, so stores must subsidize commission and transportation costs. It may be possible to endure the pain for a short period, but now that the rice price increase has extended and shows no sign of abating, the stores cannot bear the long-term losses and business is difficult to maintain, requesting relief, etc. The association convened an executive supervisory board meeting the day before yesterday, attended by Zhang Nianxuan, Lu Wenshao, Shi Hongdong, Pan Jibin, Huang Ruyuan, Gu Hongjun, and more than ten others. Chairman Zhang Nianxuan reported on the letters from the member rice shops and began the discussion. It was generally agreed that since late February of this year, rice prices had gradually increased. At that time, it was still the middle of the Lunar New Year. It was assumed that each store had a small inventory at the end of the Lunar Year and these price increases may have been caused by a short-term shortage due to rain and reduced arrivals. Once the weather cleared and goods flooded in, prices could return to normal. Therefore, the association strongly urged the industry to endure the pain and sacrifice profits to maintain the limited price. Although goods purchased from the market were not clearly graded as mid-grade, extra fees for transportation and brokerage had to be added, while stores still sold at the limited price without adding a penny. All members were able to endure losses and fulfill their obligations, originally hoping that the source would increase slightly and rice prices would gradually return to normal. Unexpectedly, daily arrivals were still scarce, rice price increases extended, and prices remained firm without any sign of falling. How could the industry bear long-term losses? After weighing the situation and reasoning, it was difficult to sustain. It was decided that, starting from April 1, each store's retail rice price would increase by 40 cents per stone for commission and transportation fees to avoid long-term losses for the stores and maintain capital, while the limited price would be maintained and unaffected. The meeting adjourned after discussion.

### Suzhou Creek Boat Jam Severely Blocks Traffic

The section of the Wusong River (commonly known as Suzhou Creek) in the Public Concession, from the Waibaidu Bridge westward to the New Garbage Bridge, has been blocked since the day before yesterday due to too many boats coming from the inland areas of western Shanghai, making navigation impossible. From 6:00 AM to 10:00 AM yesterday, the Water Police tried to clear the waterway, barely allowing one boat to pass. However, it was soon blocked again. In the afternoon, the tide receded, making navigation even more difficult. The area from the New Garbage Bridge westward through the Wuzhen Road Bridge, the New Zhabei Bridge, to the sampan factory's New Bridge was packed solid. Boats were stranded on both sides of the bank. Looking east and west from the bridge, the docked boats resembled a swarm of ants. Looking at each other, they could only sigh helplessly. However, as of last night, navigation had not resumed and traffic had been blocked for two days.

### French Concession Opens New Children's Park

Located on the Site of the Former Verdun Park

Scheduled to Open Tomorrow

The "Continental Daily News" reports that the children's park called Verdun Park, located in the commercial center of the French Concession, is scheduled to officially open on Saturday (i.e., tomorrow) after two weeks of construction. This new park is not large, forming a triangle adjacent to the French Tennis Association's tennis court. There is an entrance along Avenue Joffre. In previous summers, the area was leased by a grassland cinema, but business was not prosperous. This small piece of land is planted with various trees and new grass needs to be laid. It is reported that those who purchase monthly tickets can enter.

### Guangdong and Xiafei Collide with Each Other; Both Ships Severely Damaged; The Accident Occurred in the Waters Between Shantou and Hong Kong; Heavy Fog at Sea Led to the Incident

(Special Report from Our Newspaper) The Great British Company's new postal ship, Guangdong, weighing over 17,000 tons, first arrived in Shanghai from the United Kingdom on November 13 of last year, joining the Eurasia route. On December 6, it returned to the UK from Shanghai via Japan. This was the vessel's second trip to the Far East. This past Sunday (26th), it returned to Shanghai from Japan. The day before yesterday (28th), it loaded cargo and passengers in Shanghai, heading to Hong Kong via Singapore and the South Seas ports before returning to London via the Mediterranean. Last night, the city suddenly heard that the vessel had collided with the French Postal Company's giant vessel, General Xiafei, in the waters between Shantou and Hong Kong, about 130 miles from Bolica Point, due to heavy fog at around 9:00 AM yesterday morning. Both ships were severely damaged. The Guangdong had three holes punched in it, fortunately above the waterline. The ship's owner urgently sailed towards Hong Kong and had arrived last night. After the accident, the General Xiafei also sailed back to Hong Kong due to the severe damage to the hull. It is expected to arrive in Hong Kong this morning. Both vessels will be docked for repairs. The General Xiafei was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (April 1), but it has been postponed due to this. The date of arrival in Shanghai will be determined after repairs. The date of the Guangdong's return to the UK will also be delayed.

(Reuter's, Hong Kong, 30th) The Great British Steamship Company's vessel Guangdong collided with the French vessel General Xiafei in the fog north of Hong Kong this morning. The General Xiafei has sent a wireless telegram stating that it is currently sailing back to Hong Kong. According to reports, the French Ambassador to China, Gossmar, is one of the passengers on the ship. The Guangdong may not be able to reach Hong Kong this morning due to fog at sea and damage to the hull. The ship is currently leaking, but does not need rescue. It is likely that the Kitlerel, currently in Hong Kong, will replace the Guangdong and sail to England on schedule, but this has not yet been confirmed.

### Counterproductive: Counterfeit Currency Harms the Japanese; Chinese Use Counterfeit Currency to Exchange for Japanese Yen; Japanese Cannot Use the Currency to Purchase Goods

The "Continental Daily News" reports that a certain foreign businessman arrived in Shanghai from Beiping yesterday (29th). According to him, the recently implemented monetary policy to support the "United Reserve Bank" banknotes may not benefit the Japanese themselves. Before implementing the new currency policy prohibiting the circulation of legal tender from the Chinese government, Chinese merchants in North China had imported a large number of Japanese goods. Since they were forced to accept "United Reserve Bank" banknotes paid by Japanese merchants, the result now is that Chinese merchants import Japanese goods with this valueless currency, and the Chinese merchants are the ones who profit, while the Japanese merchants lose. This is because Japanese merchants cannot circulate "United Reserve Bank banknotes" in Japan. However, Japanese merchants, represented by Chinese, must repay the price of goods with legal tender from the Chinese government when purchasing raw materials from various towns and cities in the North China interior for transport and export; otherwise, farmers refuse to sell their agricultural products. As for the exchange rate, it was a few days ago one yuan of legal tender for 1.20 yuan of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes. This difference is especially large when Japanese merchants export large quantities of Chinese raw materials, amounting to a huge sum. For the past few months, the situation has become increasingly dire for the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese authorities finally decided to implement the new currency regulations and implement an export control plan, stipulating that only Japanese merchants are allowed to conduct export trade in North China. As far as the foreign businessman can predict, the new currency and export control plan will ultimately not benefit the Japanese themselves. Once the new currency regulations are adopted, most of the Chinese merchants in North China will almost completely stop selling raw materials to the Japanese. On the other hand, Chinese merchants have also expressed that they are unwilling to import Japanese goods again, at least not as much as they have been importing in recent months. The strange fact is that after the Japanese authorities prohibited the circulation of legal tender, most Chinese merchants tried their best to collect a large number of Japanese yen banknotes. According to the foreign businessman, a large number of Japanese yen banknotes have been secretly transported to Shanghai to be exchanged for foreign currencies other than legal tender. Many Chinese merchants in North China are willing to exchange "United Reserve Bank" banknotes for Japanese banknotes. Now, under the new currency conditions, they would rather hold on and not engage in commercial activities. The foreign businessman also mentioned rumors about Wu Peifu, saying that Wu still insists on his own ideas, waiting for the Japanese side to fully comply with his demands. Wu once requested that he be allowed to lead several divisions of independent Chinese troops and be granted full authority to maintain peace and order in the North China region, especially Hebei Province, and demanded that the Japanese authorities guarantee the funding to maintain this army. The Japanese authorities were probably willing to agree to this request, but Japan is too poor and unable to raise the necessary funds. As far as he knows, Wu is still in Beiping. Since the Japanese authorities talked about Wu becoming a Japanese puppet, no other news has been heard. The merchant did not say, "I believe Wu is an honest Chinese gentleman who would not serve the Japanese in such a cruel plan."

### After the Tianmu Mountain Meeting: Guerrilla Warfare Imminent in Western Zhejiang; Hua Tingjin's Army to Lead Troops Eastward; Japanese Troops on the Jiangxi Border Poised to Invade Western Zhejiang; Japanese Aircraft Bombing Eastern Zhejiang for Days with Minimal Damage

Special dispatch from our newspaper: Since the Japanese navy harassed various coastal ports of Zhejiang Province, attempting to coordinate with the army and encroach upon Western Zhejiang, the Chinese military authorities held an important meeting at Tianmu Mountain to reallocate defense responsibilities, planning to use five divisions to prevent the Japanese army from invading south. On the Qiantang River front, the 　Army Group under Liu Jianxu is amassing troops, continuously crossing the river to counterattack Hangzhou. The 62nd Division and the 45th Independent Brigade are very active in the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway area. According to reliable sources, the Japanese troops entrenched in the Xinshi area have recently been cleared out by Xie's regiment of the 62nd Division. The Su-Jia (Suzhou-Jiaxing) Road, the lifeline of the Japanese army's rear, is under the control of Zhu Xi's advancing army in southern Jiangsu. This unit consists mostly of soldiers from Jiangsu and Zhejiang and possesses substantial strength. Last autumn, they once recovered Nanxun and Zhenze, drawing the attention of the Japanese army. Subsequently, they were ordered to return to the rear for intensified training and reorganized into a crack force. At the end of January this year, Deputy Commander Wang Songxian led some powerful detachments to advance on the Su-Jia Road at opportune moments. As for Commander-in-Chief Zhu Xi, after the Tianmu Mountain meeting, he has consulted with Huang Shaoxiong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, regarding operational matters and will soon lead his troops eastward, coordinating with the regular army to launch extensive guerrilla warfare, completing the task of threatening and containing the enemy. The situation in Western Zhejiang is about to suddenly become tense again.

Japanese Troops on the Jiangxi Border Attempt to Invade Zhejiang

A telegram from Jinhua reports that the Japanese troops invading Nanchang appear to be advancing towards Western Zhejiang. Chinese military and political authorities, including Liu Jianxu, Huang Shaoxiong, and Zhou Enlai, have been stationed in various areas to establish a tight defense. No less than 200,000 Chinese troops are concentrated along the Zhejiang coast, ready to fight. If the Japanese army invades, they are determined to exact a heavy price.

Japanese Aircraft Reconnoiter and Bomb Various Locations in Eastern Zhejiang

Yesterday, a reporter from Modern News Agency learned from foreign shipping industry sources in this city that Japanese aircraft have been flying to various locations in Eastern Zhejiang for reconnaissance for days. On the morning of the 26th, Ningbo issued three air raid alerts. The first time, a faint engine sound was heard, but the aircraft did not enter the territory, and the alert was lifted immediately. The second time, three Japanese aircraft were spotted circling over Yuyao and then dropping over a dozen bombs on the Linshanwei area, causing no damage. The third time, around 9:00 PM, the Ningbo authorities implemented a blackout, and Zhenhai also implemented it simultaneously, lifting it at 9:50 PM. Additionally, on the afternoon of the 26th, two Japanese aircraft flew to the Shangyu coast for reconnaissance, dropping bombs over Lihai, destroying several civilian houses and killing two civilians. They then flew to Songxia Town to wreak havoc, causing no damage. At 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 28th, a Japanese aircraft flew over Baiguan in Shangyu, dropping three bombs, destroying seven houses. It then flew to Songxia Town, dropping one bomb, which landed in the Xiehe Sauce Garden, killing and injuring three people.

No Japanese Warships Sighted Along the Coast

Several Japanese warships had been wantonly harassing Taizhou, Zhenhai, Dinghai, and other places along the coast of Eastern Zhejiang and patrolling back and forth since the 17th of last month, seizing fishing boats and searching foreign vessels. According to news from foreign ships arriving in Shanghai from Wenzhou and Ningbo, no Japanese warships have been seen along the coast of Eastern Zhejiang for days. No Japanese warships were found in the waters of Zhenhaikou, Fenghua Port, Xiangshan Port, and Hengshanbu in Ningbo. The situation in various places is peaceful, but the stationed troops are maintaining strict vigilance and have not relaxed their guard.

Residents of Zhenhai Voluntarily Relocating

The situation in Zhenhai has been quite peaceful since the Japanese warship shelling stopped, but many residents are voluntarily relocating. It is reported that the entire city has fewer than 800 households, and only about half of the shops are open for business. On the morning of the 26th, representatives from the Zhenhai Party, government, and military sectors convened a conference on defending Zhenhai at the Zhenhai Maritime Police Bureau. One of the proposals was to blockade the Dajia River (i.e., the Yong River estuary), but it was not approved due to its impact on travel and cargo transportation. The previous rumors circulating in Shanghai about the Zhenhai gap being blockaded have thus been proven to be unfounded. Furthermore, the old Taiping轮 ship, prepared to block the gaps in the Zhenhai blockade line when necessary, is still docked at the China Merchants Wharf east of Zhenhaiwei Street and has not been moved.

The Ningbo-Dinghai Route Operates as Usual

After the Shanghai-Dinghai route was suspended again, the Ningbo-Dinghai route continues to operate as usual, with the Libao 轮 ship traveling back and forth. Therefore, passengers and cargo traveling from Shanghai to Dinghai can still detour via Ningbo. Although the authorities have prohibited ships from calling at the Shipu port, the Lidou 轮 ship is specially permitted to call once every Saturday to facilitate passenger and cargo transportation, while all other ships are strictly prohibited from calling. After the Ningbo-Taizhou route was suspended again, the situation in Haimen is gradually becoming more stable, and the Gaodeng Maler 轮 ship is preparing to resume service. The ships on the Shanghai-Taizhou route are not planning to send ships for the time being.

### First Thunderstorm Since Spring in This City

Indoor Temperature Above 65 Degrees

Caused by a Low-Pressure System Passing Through

The weather in this city, after being affected by a high-pressure system passing through last week and becoming cold for a time, gradually became warmer afterward. In the past few days, the daily temperature has been gradually increasing, which is a normal phenomenon after the beginning of spring. However, the climate yesterday was suddenly sultry, even more so in the afternoon. The indoor temperature rose to above 65 degrees, an increase of about seven degrees compared to the previous day. At 2:00 PM, there was a rumble of thunder, followed by rain. This was the first thunderstorm of the year since the beginning of spring, caused by a low-pressure system passing through in the northeast.

### Over a Thousand Plainclothes Soldiers Ambush Japanese Troops in Longhua; Encounter Battle Occurs at Lu-Fu Bridge; Company Commander Hu Fei Heroically Sacrifices Himself

Simultaneously Conduct In-Depth Reconnaissance in the City Center

For months, plainclothes soldiers in the Nanshi area have formed a solid defense line, lurking in the suburbs and launching occasional attacks, exhausting the Japanese army, which is struggling to cope. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 29th), over a thousand plainclothes soldiers suddenly mobilized in large numbers, carrying light weapons, and advanced towards the Japanese Marine Corps headquarters in Longhua from the Xujia Garden area, clashing with Japanese troops at Lu-Fu Bridge. The sound of machine guns continued throughout the day, and the battle was fierce. The Japanese vanguard suffered heavy casualties and was unable to hold on, so they called up the rear guard. The two sides then remained locked in a stalemate for two hours. The Japanese army, intimidated, attempted to encircle and "eliminate" the enemy in one fell swoop. However, the plainclothes soldiers saw through their scheme and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The Japanese army could not withstand the onslaught and collapsed. Seeing that their objective had been achieved, the plainclothes soldiers took the opportunity to scatter and escape towards the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. In this battle, the plainclothes soldiers suffered over twenty casualties, while the Japanese army suffered several times more. Company Commander Hu Fei of the plainclothes soldiers also heroically sacrificed himself in this bloody battle.

Heavy Gunfire in the City Center

Last night (the 29th), heavy gunfire was heard in the city center, east of the puppet municipal government. It gradually approached the puppet government, so the Japanese army mobilized its troops and prepared to resist. Suddenly, the gunfire shifted from east to west, interspersed with the sound of small mortars and machine guns. Because it was night, the Japanese army feared being surrounded by plainclothes soldiers and dared not advance blindly, only firing wildly at random. By dawn, the gunfire had ceased, and the Japanese army searched everywhere but found nothing. They then blockaded traffic in the city center, which happened to be the time when puppet government officials were going to "work." Therefore, all the puppet officials, large and small, were blocked and unable to proceed, appearing disheveled and waiting in the suburbs for several hours before being led to work by Ishii, a senior advisor to the puppet government. Currently, the Japanese have deployed heavy troops to guard the areas around the puppet government and the city center. It is said that the gunfire was indeed caused by Chinese plainclothes soldiers threatening the Japanese army and reconnoitering their movements.

Contact in the Shanghai West Area

The other day (the 29th), guerrillas in Pudong and the Minhang area west of the Huangpu River publicly redeployed their defenses and opened fire on small Japanese warships in the Huangpu River south of Pudong, resulting in a fierce battle. Guerrilla regiments have been attacking the Japanese army in Dujiahang, south of Pudong, and Minhang, west of the Huangpu River, for two days. Stray bullets are flying everywhere, and traffic has been cut off, so all ships traveling between Shanghai and Pudong have been suspended. At the same time, Wang Jinshan's troops in the Shanghai West area have also advanced to Beixinjing, Hongqiao Road, and other places. Because the Japanese army has no troops to spare in Shanghai, they have transferred the puppet "Pacification Army" from Suzhou to Shanghai to cope with the situation. Wang's troops in the Shanghai West area have been engaged in intermittent battles with this puppet "army."

Tracks on Shangchuan Road Suddenly Damaged

The Shangchuan Railway in Pudong is the Japanese army's lifeline for transportation. In order to eliminate the guerrillas lurking in the Jujianchuan area, the Japanese have been mobilizing troops and advancing towards Chuansha for days. The night before last (the 28th), several sections of the railway tracks were suddenly damaged, so yesterday (the 29th), six Japanese military vehicles were unable to proceed. They are currently being repaired by Japanese engineers. This action was likely carried out by brave guerrillas.

### Guerrillas in Nanhui Establish Defenses on Land and Water

Evacuate the Masses in Datuan

No Japanese Aircraft Dropped Bombs

The situation in Nanhui, Pudong, has been relatively tense recently. The Japanese army has been frequently mobilizing between Zhoupu and Xinchang for days, and rumors are circulating that they plan to invade Datuan from the east. The guerrillas are determined and have thoroughly destroyed the land traffic between Datuan and Xinchang. The masses have contributed greatly to this effort, creating a situation where all roads are blocked. On the waterways, they have adopted a step-by-step blockade strategy from Datuan to Zhongxin Bridge and then from Zhongxin Bridge to Xinchang. At every bend and key point, they have filled the river with branches and mud, leaving only a narrow gap for small boats to pass through. The land and water traffic between Nanhui County and Xinchang, and between Nancheng and Zhuqiao, have been similarly blockaded, making it difficult for the Japanese army to invade Nanhui from both directions. Furthermore, according to someone who arrived in Shanghai from Datuan via a detour yesterday, the guerrillas have implemented air defenses and evacuated the masses in the town. The rumors that Japanese aircraft flew to Datuan and dropped three bombs are untrue. The order in the town remains extremely stable. Fortifications have also been built in the suburbs of Nancheng, with large piles of defensive materials at every entrance and exit, allowing only one person to pass through at a time.

### Portuguese Consul-General Promoted to Consul-General in New York

According to the Continental News, Alves, the Portuguese Consul-General in Shanghai, has recently been promoted to Consul-General in New York and is expected to leave Shanghai with his family around April 6th to take up his new post in the United States. His successor is Hairou, the Portuguese Consul-General in Hamburg, who is expected to arrive in Shanghai in late April. Alves was transferred from Mumbai to serve as Consul-General in Shanghai about five years ago and served as the senior consul last year while Nylon was on leave.

### He Xing Gong Ji Factory Sends Off Li Ziqing to Go Abroad

He Xing Gong Ji Refrigeration Engineering Machinery Factory and Cork Manufacturing Factory recently dispatched Assistant Manager Li Ziqing abroad to inspect the Nanyang area because the factory's business is in urgent need of development. He is scheduled to depart tomorrow on the President Coolidge. The factory held a farewell banquet at the Hongyunlai Restaurant last night. In addition to the factory's important employees, over a hundred guests attended. Toasts were exchanged, and the gathering ended happily around 9:00 PM.

### Payment Methods for Jin Chang and Other Public Bonds; Central Bank Telegraphed Chongqing for Instructions; Will Follow Instructions Upon Receiving a Reply

In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance is still trying to make arrangements to pay the principal and interest on maturing bonds. The principal and interest on the long-term financial bonds of 1928, the telecommunications bonds of 1935, the Guangdong Yuhong consolidation bonds of 1936, and the Guangdong Province Port River dredging US dollar bonds of 1937 are all scheduled to be paid by the Central Bank and other banks starting today. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank yesterday that they had previously telegraphed the Chongqing head office for instructions regarding the payment methods for Jin Chang and other bonds but had not yet received a reply. They sent another telegram to Chongqing for inquiry yesterday morning. They will follow the instructions upon receiving a reply. It is expected that the reply will arrive in Shanghai this morning.

### Massive Imports of Flour and Wheat Affect the Domestic Flour Market; Domestic Wheat Shipped to Japan for Processing and Then Dumped in China; Japanese Flour Monopolizes North China, Driving Down Domestic Flour Prices

After the war, flour mills in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were looted, and Australian and Japanese foreign flour was imported and dumped in massive quantities. At the same time, flour mills in the concessions, such as Fuxin and Fufeng, were affected by controls on wheat production in their source areas, leading to a shortage of raw materials and forcing them to order foreign wheat. As the market is flooded with foreign flour, the price of domestic flour is falling daily. The details are as follows:

Massive Imports and Dumping of Foreign Flour

Previously, due to the market demand for flour exceeding supply, various flour trading companies ordered foreign flour to be shipped to Shanghai to adjust the market. In 1938, 2,547,783 quintals were imported, valued at National Currency 52,985,269 yuan. From January to February of this year, 229,136 quintals were imported, valued at National Currency 4,400,9835 yuan. Australia accounted for the largest share, totaling 1,188,140 quintals. Japan was second, totaling 1,179,454 quintals. The United States was third, totaling 270,396 quintals.

Concession Flour Mills Order Foreign Wheat

The flour mills operating in the International Settlement, such as Fuxin and Fufeng, are ordering foreign wheat due to raw materials being controlled by the Japanese puppet regime. At the same time, the Chinese government has prohibited the re-export of miscellaneous grains to occupied areas, resulting in a wheat shortage. Shipments to Shanghai are being made in batches starting this February. In February of this year, 250,458 quintals were imported, valued at National Currency 2,242,687 yuan. The United States accounted for the largest share, totaling 172,890 quintals. Australia was second, totaling 77,559 quintals.

Domestic Wheat Shipped to Japan for Processing

The wheat purchased by the Japanese puppet regime in the areas it occupies is used as raw material for Japanese flour mills in North and Central China and also shipped to Japan, where it is processed into flour and then dumped in China. In 1938, 55,631 quintals were exported, valued at National Currency 440,142 yuan, all of which was shipped to Japan. From January to February of this year, 11,430 quintals were exported, valued at National Currency 116,661 yuan, of which 8,590 quintals, valued at National Currency 78,257 yuan, were shipped to Japan.

Japanese Flour Monopolization Affects Domestic Flour

North China was originally the sole market for domestic flour, but it has been monopolized by Japanese flour since the war. The amount of domestic flour shipped north has decreased significantly. The flour sold in the North China market today, except for Australian and American flour, is almost entirely flour from Japanese mills, such as the Green Treasure Ship, Green Mitsubishi, Green Emerald, and Green Flying Crane brands. Under special circumstances, domestic flour cannot compete in the northern market. At the same time, the Shanghai market is affected by the dumping of foreign flour, the sales of domestic flour have decreased significantly, and prices are falling daily, posing a precarious future. Flour mills like Fuxin and Fufeng are forced to reduce prices to increase sales.

### Agricultural and Commercial Bank Issues Bonds and Sets Five-Year Agricultural Plan; Handles Agricultural Loans, Striving to Increase Agricultural Production; Plans Land Reclamation, Develops Cooperation, and Purchases Local Products

In order to develop national agricultural production, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has approved the Agricultural and Commercial Bank to issue agricultural bonds, and has drafted a five-year agricultural plan to handle agricultural loans, increase agricultural production, plan land reclamation, develop cooperation, and purchase seven major local products. The details are as follows:

Completing the Five-Year Agricultural Plan

The Agricultural and Commercial Bank aims to adjust agricultural products, circulate agricultural funds, and promote the development of rural areas nationwide. When necessary, it may submit a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to request government approval to issue agricultural bonds, but the amount is limited to the total amount of the Agricultural and Commercial Bank's fixed capital. The bank's general manager, He Lian, has delineated regions and established agricultural adjustment offices, taking into account industrial and transportation conditions, to handle agricultural adjustment affairs in extraordinary times, which are planned to be completed within five years. The agricultural plan includes (1) farmland water conservancy, (2) increasing agricultural production, (3) planning land reclamation, (4) developing cooperation, (5) agricultural loans, and (6) agricultural product transportation and sales.

Handling Loans and Purchasing Local Products

The Agricultural and Commercial Bank has cooperated with the governments and water conservancy agencies of Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and other provinces to handle water conservancy loans and production loans, including seeds, fertilizers, and draught cattle. Currently, 8.3 million yuan has been loaned for water conservancy loans, 4.87 million yuan for production loans, 2 million yuan for commercial agricultural product loans, and 81,000 yuan allocated for agricultural improvement expenses. As for the purchase of major local products nationwide, it has purchased grain, cotton, and other products worth a total of 10.17 million yuan in Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, and other provinces. In Henan, Sichuan, and Guizhou provinces, it has launched a chain loan program with a total amount of 2.7 million yuan, limited to agricultural products.

Increasing Agricultural Production and Planning Land Reclamation

Regulations stipulate increasing grain production in the Northwest and increasing cotton production in the Southwest. Since implementation, it has been quite effective. Last year, cotton production in the Southwest increased significantly compared to the previous year. Wheat fields in Shaanxi Province increased by 2 million mu, and production increased by 12 million dan. (2) Cotton production in Sichuan was 900,000 dan, a doubling compared to the previous year, and cotton fields were expanded by 74,000 mu. As for planning land reclamation, it has been implemented in Shaanxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces, delineating reclamation areas and resettling refugees for land reclamation. Regarding agricultural cooperation, it has been actively promoted, and 47 cooperative treasuries have been established in Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and other provinces. Agricultural warehouses have been widely established in various places to store and mortgage agricultural products.

Actively Developing Water Conservancy Projects

To develop inland agriculture, water conservancy should be developed first to facilitate irrigation. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has established the Central Hydraulic Engineering Laboratory to conduct hydraulic engineering experiments and water conservancy research. Shaanxi Province has the most water conservancy projects under construction. The Meihui Canal has been completed, irrigating 200,000 mu. The Luohui Canal project is also nearing completion and can irrigate 500,000 mu. The Qianhui Canal can irrigate 200,000 mu, and the Heihe Canal can irrigate 100,000 mu. The Taohui Canal in Gansu has now been completed, and the Niehui Canal is nearing completion, each capable of irrigating tens of thousands of mu. Southwest provinces are also proceeding separately, and a total of 200,000 mu can be irrigated in Sichuan, 190,000 mu in Guangxi, and 200,000 mu in Hunan.

### Canned Food Disguise Containing Opium Paste; Shipped from Kunming, Seized by Customs Officials; Two Suspects Arrested, Original Offender Awaits Capture and Further Interrogation

A soil trafficker, Ying Dequan, recently shipped 72 cans of opium paste from Kunming, each can containing five taels, totaling 360 taels, worth over 5,000 yuan. He shipped it to Shanghai through the post office, disguising it as canned food. Upon arrival, on the 28th of this month at 3:00 AM, he instructed Shi Ying (aka Fengchun), a Nanjing resident living in Room 43, North China Apartments, Ma Road, French Concession, to pick up the opium paste at the General Post Office on North Sichuan Road. The matter was investigated by customs officials, who arrested Shi and reported it to the French police. After investigating Shi's case, they subsequently arrested his accomplice, Feng Tianbao, 42 years old, at No. 481 Kangti Road, and brought him to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. First, the police lawyer stated that the case still required the arrest of the original offender and requested a postponement for further verification. Judge Miao questioned the defendants briefly and then ordered them to be returned to custody, granting a postponement for further verification.

### Marital Discord: Man and Woman Attempt Suicide by Poison; Man Saved, Woman Dies – Why Do So Many Women Commit Suicide?

A week ago, at the Guangzhou Teahouse on Avenue Joffre, a young man and woman suddenly appeared at noon. They were seated by the waiters for a meal. After the meal, the staff noticed something strange about their expressions, as if they were in great pain. The teahouse immediately reported this to the Lou-ka-way police station. The two were taken to the Guangci Hospital. It was diagnosed that both had taken poison in an attempt to end their lives. After investigating their families, it was learned that the woman was named Ye Peiying and the man Yang Wenhui, both local residents. Ye was 22 years old, residing at No. 46 Yongxing Lane, Ganshi East Road. Yang was formerly employed at the Hollywood Amusement Park on Yu Yuan Road. The two met by chance and fell deeply in love, making a private marriage agreement. However, as is often the case with good intentions, this plan was discovered by the woman's parents, who strongly opposed it. The couple became disillusioned with life. That day, they went to the Guangzhou Teahouse to eat. Beforehand, they had both taken poison. When they were sent to the hospital for treatment, Yang was fortunate enough to be resuscitated. However, Ye had taken an overdose, and she died on the previous day.

Zhou Yuying, a 20-year-old local girl, residing at No. 12 Tai'an Lane, Rue Pichon, French Concession, Zhou Yuying, worked at the Tongyi Yarn Factory on Moganshan Road. Recently, she had been pursuing modern fashions, purchasing many new clothes. Her mother disapproved of her frivolous behavior and severely reprimanded her. In a fit of resentment, Zhou developed a desire to end her life. Around 8 PM the previous evening, she went alone to Room 537 of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, paid the room fee for the day, and then went out. She returned to the hotel around midnight and purchased raw opium, which she swallowed. She then locked the door and went to sleep. The night shift tea boy did not suspect anything until about 4:40 AM the next morning, when he heard moaning from the room. He reported this to the front desk, and they managed to break down the door. They found the girl lying on the bed, her face pale. Knowing that she had attempted suicide by poison, they urgently called the police and an ambulance to take her to Renji Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, she had not been poisoned for long, and her life was not in danger.

Lu Xiuzhen, a young woman residing at No. 72, Lane 411, Xin Dagu Road, Lu Xiu suddenly took a very sharp small knife at around 4:02 PM yesterday and stabbed her throat, attempting suicide. Her family caught sight of this and managed to wrest the blade from her grasp, but she was already covered in blood. They urgently called an ambulance to take her to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Her life is in great danger.

He Li Shi, a young woman residing at No. 4 Taozhu Lane, Jiujiang Road, He Li Shi, 25 years old, was deeply troubled because her husband was unemployed and the family was facing severe financial difficulties, making it difficult to maintain their daily life. In a fit of resentment, she secretly swallowed poisonous liquid at around 2:30 PM yesterday, attempting suicide. Her family noticed this and rushed her to Renji Hospital for treatment, where she was fortunately resuscitated.

### At the Sichuan Road Bridgehead: Loud Explosion, Two Injured by Shrapnel

At around 3 PM yesterday, a bomb suddenly exploded at the Sichuan Road bridgehead, causing a loud noise. Two pedestrians were injured at the scene. Fortunately, they only suffered minor facial injuries. They went to Tongren Hospital on their own. After examination by doctors, they were discharged and returned home. The injured were identified as Chen Yu, 24 years old, who works as a cashier at the Liddell Ballroom on Jing'an Temple Road, and Wu Linsheng, 28 years old, from Ningbo, who works as a cashier at the Xinzha Hotel on Xinzha Road. According to Chen and others, they were riding trolleybus No. 17. When they got off at the Sichuan Road bridgehead they only went south a few steps when a sudden loud noise and black smoke appeared, and the iron flew every which way. Both of them only suffered scrapes to the face, and were fortunate that their injuries were minor and they were quickly no longer harmed.

### Northern Xin Jing Town Searched Yesterday; Over a Hundred Villagers Arrested

Yesterday (the 30th) morning, at about 9 AM, over a hundred plainclothes Japanese soldiers suddenly placed Xin Jing Town, northwest of Shanghai, under martial law. Large numbers of armed Japanese troops set up machine guns at the entrances and exits of the town, cutting off traffic. They entered the town to conduct searches. All teahouses, taverns, and pedestrians along the way were interrogated. At that time, the morning market had not yet closed, and the town was crowded with villagers. After strict searches by the Japanese army, over a hundred villagers were deemed to be acting suspiciously and were arrested and taken away in trucks towards Hongqiao. The Japanese army searched the town for about an hour before order was restored. All those arrested were innocent.

### Puppet Police Turn a Blind Eye: Bandits Run Rampant in Gaoqiao, Murdering and Robbing, Residents Anxious, Scholar's Family Robbed, Victim Dies Tragically

Gaoqiao North Township, surrounded by water on three sides, is a remote and peaceful area. However, since this spring, a group of local ruffians, numbering over ten, have been gathering and robbing indiscriminately. On the night of February 25th, the families of Lao Wei, Yuan Baofa, and Huang Jinhuo were robbed of jewelry, rings, and clothing worth over 300 yuan. On March 3rd, Shen Guiqing of Cangfangtou was robbed of over 80 yuan, and his right foot was dislocated, preventing him from getting up to this day. On the night of the 14th, Dou Mengxing's family in Yejiajiao was robbed, losing over 200 yuan. His sixty-year-old mother and unemployed brother were beaten black and blue, their heads broken and bleeding. It is said that his mother has already died. On the night of the 24th, Song Fugui's family was robbed, reporting a loss of over 300 yuan. Song Fugui and his son-in-law were both seriously injured and unable to get up. On the night of the 25th, Zhu Risheng's family was robbed, his two sons injured, and two rings, three gold bracelets, and clothing were stolen, with a loss of over 400 yuan. On the night of the 26th, six families were robbed in Sanchagang, with losses in that area estimated at over 1,000 yuan. This group of bandits is so rampant that local residents are in a state of anxiety. The police officers in the puppet government's police station do not take any precautions before incidents occur, nor do they investigate after incidents, even if they occur nearby. It is clear that they are not protecting the people. (Another report) Lu Guixiang, a resident of Zhaitou Village, about three miles west of Gaoqiao Town, is nearly seventy years old and earns a living by teaching and farming. Although his family has been scholars for three generations and has a reputation for wealth, heavy expenses have left him with more appearance than substance. At around 10 PM the night before last, over ten bandits, each wielding a single-edged sword and iron bars, broke into his home. The men and women of the Lu family were awakened from their sleep and bound by the bandits, who confined them to a room. The bandits then searched the house, stealing clothing, cash, and gold and silver ornaments worth less than a hundred yuan. Dissatisfied, they beat Guixiang, demanding to know where the silver was hidden. However, apart from a small amount of cash that was stolen, there was nothing else hidden in Lu's home. The bandits did not believe him and tied a rope around Lu's neck, dragging him from room to room to search, and beating him with iron bars, leaving him covered in injuries and on the verge of death. Because they had not obtained anything significant, they were filled with resentment. They stabbed Guixiang three times in the neck before yelling and leaving. The Lu family members, seeing that the bandits had left, struggled to free themselves and inspected the rooms. They found Guixiang dead inside. The situation was tragic, but there was nothing they could do. They could only prepare a coffin and bury him. It is reported that the puppet police局 arrested seven bandits on Xiaosha Island yesterday and are currently interrogating them.

### Shooting Incident on Avenue Amiral Foch Yesterday Morning: Mr. Ping Shot at While Boarding Car; Multiple Shots Miss, Reason Unknown

Yesterday morning, an attempted assassination by shooting occurred on Avenue Amiral Foch in the French Concession. There were a total of three assailants. One was unarmed, apparently a lookout in the case. The other two fired at a man in his forties wearing a Western-style suit. The two assailants fired six or seven shots in total. Strangely, the man being pursued was very close to the assailants, only a foot or two away, but he was not hit. He escaped unscathed. The assailants, having exhausted their ammunition, fled. Details are recorded below.

Waiting for Car Owner

At about 9:45 AM yesterday, a purple-black private car with a black license plate, French Concession license number 7468, was parked at the No. 5 entrance along Avenue Amiral Foch (opposite the Jin Gu Cun apartments, near Rue du Père Froc). The front of the car faced west. The chauffeur sat in the car, waiting for the owner to board.

Assailants Emerge

Before long, a man in his forties wearing a deep yellow spring suit arrived. As he approached the car and reached for the door handle to open it, three assailants suddenly emerged from the corner of Rue du Père Froc. One was unarmed and signaled to the two armed assailants, who were wearing black coats and holding pistols.

Chase and Shoot

The two armed assailants quickly ran to the front of the car and opened fire on the man in the suit who was about to board. The man, seeing this, was shocked and quickly turned and fled west. The two assailants pursued him relentlessly, firing as they chased. They fired as many as six or seven shots, even at a distance of only a foot or two. However, the man was not injured.

Police Search

At the same time, the assailants seemed to have exhausted their ammunition and turned back and fled towards Rue du Père Froc. The man who was being pursued fled into the nearby Chinese Arts and Crafts Society. Nearby police officers heard the gunshots and quickly gathered from all directions. Seeing the man, they immediately reported to the Lou-ka-way police station. The chief of police, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to the scene and conduct a search. After the Chinese and foreign detectives arrived, they searched for the assailants without success. They learned that the man's surname was Ping and that he had recently purchased car number 7468 from a friend in Shanghai and had been using it for several days. The police are currently investigating the reason for the assassination attempt.

### Fan Jingmei Found Not Guilty in False Accusation Case

Fan Jingmei of the Yuanyuan Hat Shop on Wangping Street, Shandong Road, had previously filed a case with the Second Special Court against Wu Changlin and others of the Jixiang Street Hat Shop in the French Concession, accusing them of forgery, embezzlement, and breach of trust. The defendants were ordered to post bail of 1,000 yuan each. Subsequently, the Yuanyuan Hat Shop was suddenly splattered with excrement and received repeated threatening phone calls, becoming unbearable. They reported this to the General Police Station, which learned that the Chen Tianyi Hat Shop and Fan had a lawsuit. Chinese and Western detectives, together with French police, went to investigate the Chen Hat Shop. Xing Changlin, a partner in the shop, claimed that Fan had made false accusations and hired lawyers Fan Gang and Qian Xingzhong to file a criminal complaint with the First Special Court against Fan Jingmei for false accusation, submitting police records indicating accusations against Wu Changlin. After one hearing, the testimonies diverged, and the court rescheduled the hearing and ordered the investigating officer, Liu Qingsheng, to be summoned to testify. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the hearing in Criminal Court I. The defendant hired lawyers Yue Junwei and He Yizhang to defend him. Detective Liu Qingsheng testified that he and a Western detective investigated the incident of Fan Jingmei being splattered with excrement. The reporter was named Fan Yushu. The police asked him if he had any feuds or personal grievances with the shop. The reporter said that he had a lawsuit with Chen Tianyi but did not specify who, etc. Then, the plaintiff, Wu Changlin, testified that Fan Yushu was the defendant and that the defendant, Fan Jingmei, said that Fan Yushu was the accountant of the Yuanyuan Hat Shop and had already been brought to court for questioning. The court, deeming the case clear, ordered the debate to begin. After mutual arguments by the lawyers of both parties, Judge Huang ruled Fan Jingmei not guilty.

Cai Ling Shu Ying, a Suzhou woman residing in a small room at No. 49 Caishi Road, French Concession, is thirty-two years old. She previously married Cai Bohua, son of the former Shanghai magistrate Cai Hefu, as a concubine. She has two sons, the elder named En Guan, seven years old this year, and the younger named Yuan Guan, four years old. On August 20, 1937, Bohua died of illness. Ling and her two sons

Observed the Funeral Rites. Unexpectedly, Cai Shi Xiuqing, the wife of Cai Bohua, and Gan Shousun and Shou Kang and the others deny that Ling's two sons are Bohua's sons. Therefore, Ling hired lawyers Fan Gang and Ying Shi to represent her and filed a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, requesting confirmation of their identities. On June 25, 1938, the judge ruled that Cai En Guan and Cai Yuan Guan were confirmed as Bohua's sons. Since the verdict in the case, Cai Shi and her sons

Have Ignored Them and Not Provided Support, causing Ling and her three sons to have no means of support. Their applications to enter refugee camps were rejected. Helpless, they were temporarily staying in a small room belonging to relatives. On one hand, they still hired lawyers Fan Gang, Ying Shi, and Yu Enliang to represent them and filed a lawsuit with the Central Police Station of the French Concession against Cai Shi Xiuqing, Cai Shousun, and Cai Shou Kang, accusing them of abandonment. They requested that they be prosecuted according to Article 293 of the Criminal Law, in addition to

Adding a Civil Suit. Cai Ling requested a monthly calculation of 40 yuan for her portion. From her current age of thirty-two to sixty years old, a total of twenty-eight years, totaling 13,540 yuan. Cai En Guan, seven years old, has monthly educational expenses of 30 yuan, calculated to the age of twenty, thirteen years remaining, totaling 4,680 yuan.

The above living expenses are the minimum and should be borne by the defendants, etc. The police chief

Sent Detectives to Summon the Defendants. Since the defendants could not be summoned, the plaintiffs were summoned to Criminal Court I of the Second Special Court yesterday afternoon. The police lawyer first stated the case and requested verification, claiming that the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, Ying Shi, stated that the defendants were indeed residing in Room 18, Yang's Apartment Building, No. 6 Hualong Road, and deliberately refused to appear in court. Moreover, Cai Shoukang is a well-known doctor and should be issued a warrant by the court for investigation. Judge Miao Qingbang ruled to summon the defendants for further inquiry.

### Murder by Jealousy, Body Abandoned: Adulterer Confesses to the Crime, Zhang Er, the Woman, is Still at Large, Brother Ordered to Turn Her In

Zhang Er, a young woman from Funing who previously lived in a bungalow on Yuan Road, Yangshupu, became acquainted with Pang Kaibao, a fellow villager working as a road laborer, last winter. They often met for secret rendezvous. Later, her husband, Bao Youqing, discovered this and questioned her. Unexpectedly, Zhang and Pang Kaibao conspired to preempt him. On the morning of the 21st of last month, while Bao Youqing was asleep, Pang Kaibao sneaked into the bedroom and axed Bao to death. They carried the body to a nearby wasteland and threw it into a pond. When tying the corpse with rope, they tied a tin bucket of stone to the end to make it sink. The case was solved by Chinese detectives Guo Jingbang and Ji Xiucheng of the Yangshupu police station, who arrested the murderer Pang Kaibao and handed him over to the First Special District Local Court. Zhang Er, the woman, is at large. She was ordered to be sent back, but Zhang could not be apprehended. Detective Guo learned that Zhang's escape was facilitated by her mother's son, Zhang Youfu (Zhang Er's brother). The day before yesterday, Detective Guo arrested him at No. 8 Pingliang Road and took him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he and Pang Kaibao were sent to Criminal Court I. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, explained the situation and requested detention. When questioned, Pang Kaibao admitted that the case was initiated by Zhang Er and that the axe was stolen by her from Li Jiang, a neighbor. Afterwards, they carried the body to the pond and threw it in, with her holding the head and him holding the feet, sinking it to the bottom. Zhang Youfu's testimony was evasive, denying that he helped his sister Zhang Er escape. He said that he did not know where she was. Judge Huang Risheng ordered him to be detained and ordered Zhang Youfu to hand over his sister Zhang Er for questioning.

### Husband's Health and the Relationship to Eugenics

Like father, like son.

Because of scientific advancements, we now know that a person's language, actions, thoughts, and entire life are shaped by two factors: nature and nurture. Improving the environment depends on the spread of education, and improving nature requires efforts in eugenics. In this era of national revival, the most fundamental and thorough approach is to promote universal education urgently, but we believe that measures to improve national traits should be given at least as much attention as education.

Like father, like son. When it comes to eugenics, the father's health and intelligence are most important. Someone studied the family line of the great scientist Darwin and found that sixteen famous scientists appeared in five generations from his grandfather onwards. "The son of a general is always a general." Courage and physical strength also have considerable influence in inheritance. Indeed, a healthy and robust man, once married to a beautiful and graceful woman, will surely have a deep love, a sweet family, and a happy life, and their children will also be intelligent and lively and develop healthily. If a family has wise and strong descendants, even if the family is relatively poor, the future prospects are limitless! At the same time, how comforting this is to their parents! As the saying goes: "Poverty without wealth is not poverty, poverty without children is true poverty, having sick and weak children is like owing a debt." However, most fathers are unaware of this. They either commit self-harm and nocturnal emissions in their early years, or indulge in excessive sexual activity after marriage, or, due to other worries and overwork, deplete their bodies, leaving them outwardly strong but inwardly weak, frail, or even suffering from neurasthenia, brain swelling, headaches, dull thinking, forgetfulness, insomnia, back pain, limb fatigue, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin sperm, infertility, and other symptoms. As a result, they cannot lead a fulfilling life with their wives and are hated by them, their love fades, and if they have sons or daughters, they are often weak or die young, or even remain childless, causing lifelong regret! Therefore, the father's weakness not only deprives him of his own happiness but also affects his descendants. At the same time, it is also deeply and significantly related to the nation and the country! To seek remedies, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, it is generally recognized that taking the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Shengzhis" is the most effective treatment. This agent can produce sperm, tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain, invigorate blood circulation, and nourish nerves after taking it. If you continue to take it, you will be able to fully recover early and achieve the effects of prolonging life and rejuvenating. Only those who have nocturnal emissions need to take "Ximitu's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" at the same time to consolidate the sperm gate and prevent leakage, then the effect will be even faster.

Beauty

### The Scientific Remedy for Shrunken Breasts

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

Around the time a girl experiences her first menstruation, her physiology undergoes a transformation. A sallow complexion gains a rosy hue. Embarrassing soft hairs begin to grow in the armpits and pubic region. Hips that were not very full become more so. And the pair of breasts on her chest gradually become firm and erect, like balloons being inflated. A gaze like autumn water, when encountering a strange man, shyly glances at him. A welcoming smile constantly appears on her face. Her temperament and tone of voice become gentle. Her gestures and demeanor shed the form of a young girl, and exhibit the unique poise of a "virgin."

How beautiful a virgin truly is! But this period is the most dangerous for a woman, despite its mystery and loveliness! Because physiological changes and surging desires easily lead those with weak wills to indulge in masturbation. The most common adverse effect is menstrual irregularity, or even amenorrhea. This leads to a multitude of ailments, causing the breasts, which govern female health, to become severely shrunken, ovarian function becomes abnormally weakened, metabolic processes lose their ability to nourish, muscles become wasted, and the complexion becomes haggard. Not only will they inevitably fail in the competition for beauty, but they will also develop frigidity and infertility once they enter into marital relations, and be hated by their husbands. Happiness will be non-existent. The only remedy, according to famous Chinese and foreign gynecologists and my own experience, is to take the ovarian preparation "Shengzhisu" (Reproductive Element), which is most effective for the condition. This preparation is exquisitely formulated. Taking it for just one day and night can nourish ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation, and warm the uterus to stop leukorrhea. Continued use can not only cure various hidden female diseases but also make the breasts erect, the cheeks rosy, and youthfulness lasting.

### A Self-Help Plan for Young Men with Nocturnal Emission

— Zhan Nian-zeng, Venereal Disease Specialist

According to doctors, the reason why many young men suffer from nocturnal emission is primarily due to masturbation. It not only wastes the most precious reproductive fluids in the body, but also causes great damage to the nerves. Therefore, those who masturbate often suffer from neurasthenia. Because of neurasthenia, the sphincter of the vas deferens is often in a state of hypersensitivity, or even loses its function, so nocturnal emission erupts.

Nocturnal emission is a terrible scourge for young men. Frequent nocturnal emission will inevitably exacerbate neurasthenia. As a result, symptoms such as insufficient brainpower, sluggish thinking, forgetfulness, insomnia, tinnitus, blurred vision, timidity and anxiety, depression, lower back pain, body fatigue, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, and impotence will follow. Furthermore, due to the depletion of essence and blood, developmental functions are hindered, leading to incomplete development, with the penis being as short as a finger, or insufficient sperm production, leading to a lack of sperm or even none at all, resulting in thin semen and infertility. Such men are not only hated by their wives for their inability to enjoy sexual relations, but if their wives are strong-willed and cunning, they may engage in adultery, elope, or sue for divorce, which is a common occurrence in today's society. Even if their wives sob quietly and try to maintain the family, the children born are often weak. The mother worries about the children's illnesses, and what joy is there in the family? As for infertility and the lack of descendants, it will bring lifelong regret!

The remedy for nocturnal emission today is to take "Ximituo's Solid Essence Pills," which are most effective. This medicine, after being taken, can strengthen the sphincter, calm the nerves, reduce dreams, and promote sleep, so nocturnal emission can be cured. If nocturnal emission has already caused the above symptoms, "Shengzhisu" (Reproductive Element), a preparation of gonadotropin, should be taken to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continued use can restore health as soon as possible. However, if the patient can come to my clinic for a diagnosis by a specialist, the use of electrotherapy, injections, surgery, and other methods can guarantee a cure.

### Posterior Urethritis is Not to Be Feared

Common people think that once leukorrhea bacteria enter the posterior urethra, their disease is hopeless. This is certainly an overreaction. Others believe that before leukorrhea invades the sexual organs, the gonococci will never invade the posterior urethra, and therefore boldly disregard it, which is a big mistake. In short, in the acute stage of gonorrhea, the gonococci are mostly concentrated in the anterior urethra in the first two or three days. If one can strictly adhere to health preservation methods and use scientific methods for treatment, the gonococci can be easily eliminated. Otherwise, they will not immediately invade the posterior urethra. However, if one does not observe health preservation and is treated by incompetent doctors who recklessly perform inappropriate surgeries, the gonococci will be stimulated by these bad treatments and take advantage of the opportunity to enter, often invading the posterior urethra within two or three days and causing various symptoms, which is something that cannot be ignored.

Once gonorrhea enters the posterior urethra, various complications will follow, the most obvious being gonorrheal cystitis, prostatitis, orchitis, nephritis, etc. Therefore, many patients are terrified when they learn that gonorrhea has spread to the posterior urethra. However, based on my experience, the various symptoms caused by posterior urethritis are not to be feared. Taking gonorrheal prostatitis as an example, this symptom is the most likely to occur in gonorrhea, and the treatment is the most complicated. Most doctors only know about electrotherapy, massage, and oral medicine, but they do not know that in addition to these, I always use warm water enemas and cooling methods. When it suppurates, I immediately use quick surgery to cut open the perineum to drain the pus, so that it can heal and be cured in a short period of time. Otherwise, if prostatitis has already suppurated and the patient is still allowed to suffer, it will lead to a prostatic fistula that will never be cured. This is all the fault of the doctor. However, most doctors dare not perform this because of their poor surgical skills. To become a famous gonorrhea doctor, one must be bold and meticulous. Consultation hours: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM

Specialty: Also treats syphilis, buboes, chancres, and painless new method for circumcision.

### Letter

To the Editor: I am writing on behalf of my client, Huang Shuying, who stated that he recently read a news item in the news column of the Shenshi and Liangbao on the 28th of this month, titled "Doctor Yu Tingxiang Sues for Medical Expenses." The news item stated that Yu Tingxiang, a doctor at the Hua'an Insurance Company on Jing'an Temple Road, instructed lawyer Qian Yuzhong to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's Civil Division against Huang Shuying, an employee of the Huafeng Industrial Company on Fada Road, alleging that from August 23 to September 22, 1938, Huang Shuying received treatment for leukorrhea, syphilis, and neck sores from Yu Tingxiang, totaling 14 yuan for consultations. Despite repeated attempts to collect the payment, Huang Shuying refused to pay and even used abusive language. Therefore, Yu Tingxiang requested the court to summon Huang Shuying for questioning. The court approved the request and issued a summons, but the defendant failed to appear. The plaintiff's attorney presented the case, and Judge Ma Yishu ordered the defendant to be summoned again for questioning. However, this is inconsistent with the facts. My client did seek treatment from Dr. Yu for an illness, but it was not for venereal diseases. As for the consultation fees, they were all paid in full, with no arrears. Moreover, the medicines required were all prepared by my client himself. The allegations made by the doctor are mostly fabricated and damage my client's reputation. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction to clarify the situation and protect my client's reputation. In addition to sending a separate letter, I am also sending this letter to be published. Please investigate and publish this letter. Sincerely, Wan Weijian, Lawyer, March 30.

To the Editor: I read today's newspaper, which reported on a fire on Hankou Road and Guangxi Road in which many people were burned to death. It stated that firefighters pulled out three corpses with their bare hands, and acquaintances identified them as employees of Lao Rongtai. This is inconsistent with the facts. The fire started next door to our store and spread to our store. Fortunately, all the staff in the store escaped safely and were not injured. We are afraid of confusing the public, so we are writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Lao Rongtai Powder Bureau, March 29.

Chinese Medicine and Dietary Therapy

### Intestinal Parasitic Diseases in Children

— Zhu Zuosan

Seven or eight out of ten malnourished children suffer from parasitic diseases. The types of parasites vary, but they are generally caused by improper diet, raw and cold vegetables and fruits, or undercooked fish, shrimp, and meat, allowing parasite eggs to be transmitted. Excessive consumption of fatty and sweet foods leads to damp heat and stagnation, causing the parasites to breed and multiply endlessly. Affected children will inevitably have reduced appetite, fail to gain muscle, vomit clear water, and experience abdominal pain that comes and goes, sometimes becoming unbearable. Their complexion will be sallow, and their philtrum will have a bluish tinge. If left untreated, their nutrition will continue to decline, and they will become increasingly emaciated.

In the early stages of parasitic diseases, one should be cautious about diet. Vegetables and meat must be cooked thoroughly, and snacks must be avoided. Aromatic foods should not be given. Even beans should be fried with Sichuan peppercorns. Torreya seeds (commonly known as Xiangfei) have the function of killing parasites and harmonizing the spleen. Taking six or seven seeds daily, boiled in sugar water, on an empty stomach in the morning can eliminate parasites. Or, they can be soaked and cooked with the shell and eaten at any time. They are sweet and delicious and can also kill parasites. Quisqualis indica is also a common medicine for expelling parasites. Eating six or seven seeds daily can lubricate the intestinal walls, so that the parasites have nothing to attach to and are excreted from the body. For expelling parasites, the ancient formula Wumei Wan is the authoritative treatment for ascarids. Huachong Wan and Zhuichong Wan are also special formulas for treating parasites. Although the indications of the ingredients such as ume, centipeda minima, ulmus davidiana, betel nut, and toosendan radix differ, their parasite-killing effects are definite. They have a chemical or physical effect on the parasites, causing them to be anesthetized or corroded to death after exposure. Another method is to decoct five qian of pomegranate root bark (fresh is best, pomegranate fruit peel is ineffective) with three qian of betel nut in a concentrated juice, add a little white sugar, and take it on an empty stomach, which can be quite effective. However, this type of oral deworming agent should be taken on an empty stomach, or even after eating a little roasted meat or sweets to stimulate the parasites' appetite and make them more susceptible to the medicine. After taking the medicine, a mild laxative should be used as an adjuvant.

### Malnutrition

— Chen Jiazhen

Among children's diseases, malnutrition is the most common. The reason is nothing more than excessive consumption of miscellaneous foods such as candies and cakes, which leads to weakness of the spleen and stomach, digestive disorders, and stagnation of undigested food in the stomach and intestines, causing the cessation of the body's metabolic functions. Over time, worms grow in the intestines, and the food eaten daily is used to feed the worms. As a result, the number of roundworms in the intestines increases day by day, while the body's muscles gradually become thin. Blue veins appear on the abdomen, or it becomes swollen and distended. Even the muscles of the limbs become increasingly thin, resulting in malnutrition. If children want to prevent this disease, in addition to avoiding miscellaneous foods, they can eat four or five Quisqualis indica seeds daily, or seven or eight seeds for severe cases. Quisqualis indica is the Western medicine anthelmintic santonin, which is most effective in killing worms and eliminating malnutrition. It can gradually clear the parasites in the intestines, and the method of taking it is simple and easy to follow.

### Colds Require Dietary Restrictions

— Chen Weicang

Colds are prevalent in all seasons, but especially in spring and winter. Although they are mild, they can linger and change, so knowledge of dietary restrictions is essential. A brief description is as follows:

(1) Avoid Fatty Meats: Fatty meats are greasy and nourishing, which can help keep the membrane intact. In cases of colds, this will cause the body to lose its ability to eliminate toxins and prevent wind and cold from being expelled, causing body temperature to accumulate on the surface and easily leading to fever.

(2) Avoid Fishy Foods: When the lungs are bound by wind, their ability to diffuse and descend is impaired, resulting in coughing. Although coughing is a natural defense mechanism of the body to protect against external harm, it ultimately consumes energy and damages the collaterals. Fishy foods can irritate the lungs and cause them to lose their ability to resist automatically, leading to aggravation and causing sore throats, hoarseness, and respiratory pain.

(3) Eating Spicy Foods: Symptoms such as blood in the sputum should be avoided. One should not ignore minor illnesses.

### Records of Exotic Things from the Wilderness

— Fang Shen'an

When I was a child, I followed my father, who was an official in Sichuan, and traveled throughout the border areas of Sichuan and Tibet. The abundance of products, rare birds and animals, and exotic flowers and plants were everywhere. The production of medicinal materials was especially abundant, with many exotic varieties. I will record two of the things I remember below to supplement what is not included in the Compendium of Materia Medica and to provide reference for naturalists.

(1) Fritillaria Chicken

Fritillaria, also known as "Meng," is mentioned in the Mao Poems as "Xiao Caiqi Meng." In the Erya, it is written as "Meng," pronounced "Mang." Those produced in Sichuan are the best, and those near Kangding and Tibet that are large are the top grade. In spring and summer, it blooms with beautiful purple flowers. Its functions are recorded in the Compendium of Materia Medica, so I will not repeat them.

Kangding and Tibet have many mountains, and there are many unknown rare birds and animals. The Fritillaria Chicken is one type of bird, resembling a mountain chicken, with a high crown and long tail, and feathers that are colorful and patterned. Even the Golden Pheasant and Peacock cannot compare. It lives in the high mountains and only eats Fritillaria, hence the name Fritillaria Chicken. When caught and eaten, the meat is fatty, tender, and delicate. The locals consider it to be a top-grade delicacy and a top-grade tonic. Unfortunately, its production is small, and it flies quickly, making it difficult to obtain.

(2) Qianghuo Fish

Qianghuo is produced in Qiangdi, and is also found in Kangding and Tibet. The stems and leaves are covered with fine hairs. In summer, the stems grow tall, and the leaves are feathery. In autumn, it blooms with small, light green five-petaled flowers and bears purple fruits. When strong winds blow, the wild grasses undulate like waves, but the Qianghuo does not move, so it can dispel wind when used in medicine. The locals see it and dig under its roots to find a bowl-sized pool of water with two small fish. However, not every plant has this. If it is found, it is sold in the market. For symptoms of colds, it is boiled and eaten. Sweating will relieve the symptoms, making it a miraculous product for inducing sweating.

### Replenishment is Needed After Excessive Blood Loss: Dietary Therapy for "Blood in the Stool"

— Ding Bo'an

Blood is essential to the human body. Lack of blood will inevitably affect all parts of the body. Acute blood loss, if excessive, will make it impossible for us to continue our lives. Therefore, vomiting blood and nosebleeds are considered serious diseases. Although the symptoms of blood in the stool are less severe than vomiting blood, they can still harm the health of the human body, so they should also be treated and nourished.

Blood in the stool is bleeding from the anus. When discharged, it may be mixed with the stool, or before the stool, or after the stool, or it may be discharged like water spraying from a bamboo tube, with abdominal pain and tenesmus. The blood color may be bright red, purplish-brown, or black. In addition, there are also hemorrhoids bleeding, prolonged dysentery bleeding, intestinal wind bleeding, and trauma bleeding. All of these fall within the scope of blood in the stool, and the treatment methods are similar. The source of blood in the stool is actually due to damp heat flowing into the large intestine, causing heat to accumulate and steam. There are two methods of food therapy: (1) One he of japonica rice and three dried persimmons (available at South goods stores), cut into small pieces, and cook into a thin porridge with the rice. Serve as breakfast every morning, which can be quite effective. Persimmons have a sweet, mild, and astringent nature, which can strengthen the spleen, astringe the intestines, cool the blood, and stop bleeding. Eating it strengthens the absorption capacity of the intestinal blood vessels, not only treating blood in the stool, but also treating hemoptysis. (2) In the past, someone suffered from dysentery with blood in the stool, which recurred three times after recovery. The doctor ordered him to stop taking medicine and eat three crabapples (i.e., flower red) daily. The blood in the stool was cured after two weeks, and it never recurred after eating them for a month. Crabapples contain a lot of acidic juice, which enters the stomach and increases gastric juice to aid digestion. It is absorbed into the blood by the intestinal walls, increasing the blood's coagulation ability and eliminating inflammation of the stomach and intestines. Therefore, it is also effective in treating blood in the stool.

### Dietary Discussion (3)

— Qin Bowei

8. Liu Yi San (Six-One Powder): For clearing summer heat, it is best to wrap Liu Yi San in fresh lotus leaves, pierce small holes with a needle, and brew with boiling water. Liu Yi San is a mixture of talc powder and licorice root, which not only detoxifies and relieves fever but also promotes urination. Lotus leaves have a cleansing effect. Children in summer often develop acne and itching, so they should drink more of this. Alternatively, brewing fresh bamboo leaves and gypsum to drink has a similar effect, but it is too strong and can easily cause problems.

Soda Water, Fresh Orange Juice, and Floral Water: Soda water is the most popular drink on the market in summer. Its main ingredients are baking soda and citric acid, which can harmonize the middle and soothe the Qi. Fresh orange juice can cleanse the stomach and moisten the intestines. Both help digestion and are good for quenching thirst. However, drinkers must add ice, and often drink it when they are hot from labor. It is like pouring cold water on a bright furnace fire. Can the human body not react when suddenly stimulated? This is worth noting. In my opinion, China has excellent summer drinks, but they are classified as medicinal and not widely used. That is, floral water. Floral water is made by distillation, with pure materials and aromatic fragrance. In short, Qinghao dew can clear heat, Borneol dew can relieve summer heat, Lycium chinense root bark dew can eliminate heat, faba bean flower dew can stop bleeding, fresh rice leaf dew can harmonize the stomach, Rosa multiflora dew can soothe the Qi, and Eriobotrya japonica leaf dew can moisten the lungs. Lonicera japonica dew can clear heat and detoxify, and lotus flower dew can relieve summer heat and eliminate restlessness, which are especially suitable for cooling off in summer. If they can be promoted in the same way as soda water and fresh orange juice, it would be of great benefit.

10. Rice: Regarding food, rice and wheat are the main staples in China. Rice is divided into japonica and glutinous rice: In addition to moisture, japonica rice is richest in protein, followed by fat, and then ash. It can strengthen the body and make people fat. It is sweet and neutral, tonifying the spleen and stomach, as well as other organs. It generates Qi, blood, meridians, and essence, making them abundant. It strengthens the tendons, bones, muscles, and skin. The Compendium of Materia Medica describes it as stopping restlessness, thirst, and diarrhea, which are secondary effects. There are differences in the timing of planting and harvesting, as well as the location where it is grown. Early rice is slightly warm in nature, while late rice is slightly cool. Rice from high altitudes is hard and clean, while rice from low-lying areas is moist and yin in nature. Winter and spring rice is not sticky, and Xiangjing rice has a unique fragrance. Cooking it after illness harmonizes and invigorates the stomach, which is especially good. Although glutinous rice also tonifies the lungs and strengthens the spleen, it is warm and sticky in nature, difficult to digest, and excessive consumption makes people sleepy, weak, unable to control their limbs, and prone to wind and confusion. Children, the sick, and pregnant women should all avoid it.

11. Noodles: Noodles are made from wheat, which has the same properties as potatoes and contains a large amount of lime, which is an essential element for the formation of bone mass. Wheat is the best food for the growth of young people's bodies because it contains lime. Wheat is sweet and neutral in nature, thickens the stomach and intestines, strengthens Qi, tonifies deficiency, helps the five organs, and its effects are no less than those of rice. However, Southerners dislike it because it causes thirst and dampness, generates phlegm, and moves Qi. Therefore, adults with damp heat in the spleen and stomach, and children with food accumulation and malnutrition are all forbidden to eat it. However, Northerners use it as a substitute for rice and do not suffer from it, which is related to the high and dry terrain and the lack of damp heat.

### Throat Diseases are Prevalent, Pay Attention to Dietary Therapy

— Cao Xiwan

This spring, there have been continuous rains and abnormal weather, so those who are sick are everywhere. Among them, throat diseases are the most prominent. The throat is located in an important position in the human body, controlling the hub of breathing and eating. Therefore, there are many dangers when the throat is sick. In addition to appropriate treatment, attention should be paid to the adjustment of dietary therapy. The general principles of dietary therapy for throat diseases are described below for the reference of the public:

(1) Appropriate Dietary Therapy Products:

(1) Salt Soup: Salt has the function of purging heat, clearing blood, moisturizing dryness, and unblocking the two bowels. It is excellent for making a drink and gargling.

(2) White Radish: White radishes are sweet, neutral, and slightly cold in nature. They have the function of clearing phlegm heat. They can be eaten raw or shredded and served as a side dish.

(3) Aged Jellyfish: Jellyfish is salty, neutral, and slightly cold in nature. It can resolve phlegm and clear blood. Aged jellyfish is purer in nature. It is truly a wonderful product when used as a side dish.

(4) Olive: It is sweet, clear, sour, and neutral in nature. It can clear the lungs, invigorate the stomach, lower Qi, eliminate vexation, benefit the throat, and generate body fluids. It can be eaten raw or decocted.

(5) Yali Pear: It is sweet, full, slightly sour in nature. It can cool the heart, moisten the lungs, resolve phlegm, lower fire, clear the throat, moisten dryness, and benefit the large and small intestines. It is suitable for eating raw. (However, because it is too cooling, it is not suitable for symptoms of rotten throat and measles "Western name scarlet fever," which should be permeable but not cooling.)

(2) Foods to Avoid

All sour, spicy, fresh, pungent, greasy, fried, and all stimulating foods are taboo.

### The Long-Invented Chinese Organ Therapy (5)

— Xie Yenong

Deer Velvet: Deer belong to yang animals. Their essence is concentrated in the velvet. The velvet is the fleshy substance with horn-like shape before the young deer has grown antlers. It is said that the best velvet is taken from the head of a live deer. Its nature is sweet and warm. It functions to generate essence, benefit marrow, nourish blood, and tonify yang deficiency in the human body. It is most suitable and effective for men with excessive sexual desire, nocturnal emission due to spermatorrhea, deficiency-cold sperm, soft bones and fatigue, and for women with insufficient blood, uterine deficiency-cold, lower abdominal cold pain, and amenorrhea. The so-called "yang deficiency" is a hypothetical term for a type of disease. In short, it refers to a condition of aversion to cold, pale complexion, impotence, weakness of the lower back and spine, and weakness of the feet and knees, caused by factors such as weakened cardiac pumping power, slow blood circulation, weakened nerve function, and reduced body temperature. This phenomenon is especially common in the elderly. Deer velvet has the effects of stimulating, strengthening, warming, and tonifying, so it is an effective medicine for tonifying deficiency and strengthening yang. For administration, take two fen of blood velvet slices each time, with six spoons of water, put them together in a bowl and stew them on the rice cooker until the soup is very thick. Only drink the soup. The undissolved velvet can be stewed and drunk again with added water. For impotence, soak deer velvet in aged rice wine and drink it. Elderly people often take it every winter for significant tonic benefits.

Chicken Gizzard: Reduced appetite and sluggish stomach often lead to illness. After various fevers, when the illness is initially subsiding but the stomach qi has not recovered, the patient also shows a lack of appetite. Chicken gizzard has a delicious taste and is a wonderful product for strengthening the spleen and awakening the stomach. Eating it when not sick and after illness can increase appetite and aid digestion, resulting in many benefits. When cooking, it must be crushed or sliced, and it is especially good when cooked with winter bamboo shoots. The inner layer of the chicken gizzard, also known as chicken gizzard lining, is tough and golden yellow in color, hence the name "chicken inner gold." This substance has a great effect on eliminating food and removing stagnation, and it also treats acid reflux. Observe that chickens often eat magnetic chips and brick particles and can digest them, which is because this substance is rich in digestive enzymes. If you eat too much and feel a stuffy pain in your abdomen, decoct chicken inner gold and drink the soup to get immediate relief. For infantile malnutrition and food accumulation, or malaria caused by food injury, decoct chicken gizzard lining and hawthorn meat and administer it. For vomiting and acid reflux, bake chicken inner gold until it retains its nature, grind it into powder, and mix it with milk to drink.

### The So-Called "Glorious Peace"

— Maolie

Franco's 200,000 troops entered Madrid without firing a shot. The "glorious peace" of the National Defense Government has been achieved as desired. From now on, we have an even clearer understanding of the true meaning of "glorious peace"!

Since the National Defense Government was lured by benefits and forced by power to expel Negrin, it has been engaged in "glorious peace." At that time, what we understood was conditional surrender. However, Mussolini, Franco's backer, did not agree, believing that surrender should be simply surrender, without conditions. Therefore, after the National Defense Government tried its best to expel the Communist Party, seeing that the situation had gone, and there was nothing they could do, they surrendered and gave up Madrid. They may have been thinking that Franco would allow them to withdraw safely, without intercepting or pursuing them, and that they had indeed achieved "glorious peace." But what we understand at this time is unconditional surrender, which is "shameless surrender."

The Spanish matter has been settled. No matter which side is the actor and who is pulling the strings behind the scenes, everyone can breathe a sigh of relief. However, in the Far East, we have repeatedly heard the term "glorious peace." What is going on?

Previously, the ambassadors of certain countries had advised us to accept "glorious peace." We knew that this was surrender, at most with some conditions attached, and we did not agree; we continued to resist. Since then, this "glorious peace" has also been voiced in various places and in the mouths of certain colonists. We either ignored it or refuted it vehemently, and the sound dissipated and gradually disappeared. Now, it seems that some powerful people want to sing this old tune again, "glorious peace," to maintain their own interests. Looking at Spain, thinking about ourselves, we will not abandon our previous efforts, be fooled by them, and accept it!

The rhetoric of those who intend to lure and force us is predictable: you have fought for so long, you are really brave, and the whole world admires you; if you are willing to "peace," this "peace" is "glorious," and we will definitely help you with reconstruction afterwards. This is the lure. If you don't agree and continue to act recklessly, then sorry, we can't help ourselves and won't help you; take care of yourselves. This is the force. In short, they want us to stop resisting our enemies.

So the so-called "glorious peace" is "shameless surrender"! We have recognized it very clearly; we don't want "glorious peace," we want "complete victory"!

### Duel with Little Mussolini

— Written by Edwin C. Parsons, Translated by Dabeng

On September 28, 1937, American volunteer in the Spanish government army, Patrick Dickinson, engaged in an aerial duel with Bruno Mussolini, the eldest son of Mussolini. Below is Dickinson's report.

I fought in Spain for a total of sixteen months. In the fall of 1937, I was the leader of the "Red Wings" team in Castellón. At that time, Little Mussolini commanded a squadron of the National Army Air Force, stationed in Palma, opposite us.

It was at the end of August that one evening, I learned from my superior, Colonel Reyes, that Mussolini had broadcast on the National Army radio, personally challenging five aircraft of the government army. This may have been a method Mussolini used to encourage morale, but unexpectedly, the duel finally materialized.

At that time, I immediately sent a telegram, willing to fight Mussolini alone. Later, I sent telegrams urging it, and finally, thirty days later, I received the following reply:

Captain Dickinson's proposal is accepted. It is agreed to engage in a solo battle at noon on September 28, at the center of the two armies' bases, at an altitude of 15,000 feet. Each side will bring two observation planes, which are absolutely not allowed to participate in the battle. After the two sides meet, they will make a round turn to indicate the start of the battle. When one side admits defeat, it can tie its gloves to a long scarf and throw it out. Please agree to abide by the above points, Mr. Dickinson. Bruno Mussolini.

After that, I did not make any special preparations. My plane was a Soviet Boeing P.26, with 1,050 horsepower, equipped with four twin-barreled Vickers machine guns and two electrically controlled machine guns on the wings.

That day arrived, and four companions took off first in two observation planes. A quarter of an hour later, I also mustered my courage and advanced towards Palma.

It was noon, and four observation planes were circling above me. On the National Army's side, a black dot appeared. That was Little Mussolini, coming in a 1,300-horsepower monoplane.

We flew in a circle at the same time and turned again, and then the melee began. What I saw was the sparks from the enemy's machine guns, what I heard was the sharp cry of bullets passing by my ears, and what I felt was the vibration of bullets hitting the wings. We met each other head-on, engaging at close quarters within a few inches.

The two planes separated, followed by semicircular rolls, at a very close distance. I could clearly distinguish the features on Mussolini's face. I took a breath, turned the fuselage, and moved forward to engage.

The next fifteen minutes were even more tense, because the various movements were too fast, and I could hardly remember clearly. But for every action I took, he had the same or better one. The enemy's plane had 250 more horsepower than mine, so speed helped him a lot.

My plane was shaking very badly. Soviet planes could not add excessive weight and horsepower, which affected my purpose a lot.

Ascending, descending, circling, rolling, these were continuous actions in a few seconds. The speed of the sliding caused the blood vessels in my limbs to stagnate, and the air hit my body without any slack. The sound of the engine and machine guns numbed my brain until I lost my hearing.

In my experience, I had never been the target of so many bullets.

We were descending—14,000 feet, 11,000, 8,000... Our observation planes were also circling and watching.

Suddenly, I found a wound on my left arm, and blood was spurting out, so I immediately descended. This was actually a mistake, because Mussolini was right behind me, pouring his lead bullets!

I tried my best to balance myself, stopped the forward movement of the engine, slid sideways, and waited for the enemy plane to rush over to strike it. This time I saw that I hit him, because his plane swayed. Afterwards, I heard that his leg was injured (although we could not confirm it), I thought it was at this time. But within a second, he came back again.

5,000 feet, 4,000, 3,000. Eighteen minutes, twenty minutes, we continued to fight. At that time, I was hungry and tired, the bullets broke my instruments, and the glass hit my face. I thought I was going to fail. But I seized the last chance and untied my scarf at the same time.

I pretended to be circling, turned to the top. At that time, I was a large target for him. I reduced myself to the smallest position, expecting the lead bullets to smash my body, but the result was no. After I turned around, I got the opportunity. The target of the enemy plane was as big as a house to my machine guns. My heart beat even harder when my fingers started to fire the machine guns. Then I saw his hand raised, and a black object was thrown out of his plane, spreading out a white tail, a scarf and gloves!

I was happy that he didn't know that I was almost going to do the same action as him.

When I was flying level, I saw him waving his hand to signal, tilting his plane forward to show respect, and then we parted ways and went back.

In the twenty-two minutes of air combat, my plane had three hundred and twenty-six bullet holes, and I was fortunate to only suffer one arm injury. After that, Bruno Mussolini was no longer the captain of the Palma Air Force.

### Repay Strikes with Strikes

— Liu Zenghui

### A Place to Live

— Hua Fu

People living in the world, according to common sense, always have a place to live. However, some people are wailing and saying that they don't even have a place to stand. What is the reason for this? Smart people say that these people end up in this situation because they are too stupid. Besides, heaven and earth are inherently broad, so how can such a thing happen?

The way smart people deal with the world is indeed wonderful. In short, their first step is to blow, using their mouths to blow. Their mouths are better than the dragon's mouth that exhales air into clouds. With a single blow, they can change the color of heaven and earth. If they apply it in a small way, stirring up the wind, a blow can at least make the crowded people around them fall before the wind, giving them a wide space for them to come and go alone. Is the use of blowing not great?

The second step is to pat, using their hands to pat. They know that blowing is for dealing with people on the same plane. For people above them, sometimes blowing is not effective. If they just blow, they cannot stop them from pressing down. This also requires the application of patting, patting upwards. Fortunately, the people above all eat this, as long as you are willing to pat, they will rise like a ball, like a balloon, lightly rising into the air, leaving enough space above your head for you to stick your head out.

Ordinary smart people, having reached the point where they are good at both blowing and patting, will be comfortable and at ease, and will no longer think about anything else, and will stop there. Only a kind of kind-hearted smart people want to go a step further to expand their living space. The second step of this further step is to step, using their feet to step.

The wonderful use of stepping seems to be far above blowing and patting. Those who study how to establish themselves in the world must know this. Stepping means treading others underfoot. If the four sides have already been clear due to blowing, and the top has already been loosened due to patting, and now there is nothing to step on under your feet, then you can stand tall and be the only one respected. Even further, if you are really busy and have no time to blow and pat, then as long as you know how to step, stepping hard, the more you step on under your feet, the more you can rise up, like a square inch of wood, higher than a high tower. At that time, those in the same position as you will naturally be far behind, and if those above you cooperate with you, you will lift him up along with you, otherwise, you will simply overturn him, and you can "take his place."

Why should these smart people who are good at stepping be called kind-hearted? There is no other reason, because they see that ordinary useless things are not used, which is a bit of a waste. So they have great compassion and use them one by one as stepping stones, turning decay into magic, so that they can do their best and get what they deserve. They have simply done a great good deed, so they are called kind-hearted.

There are many smart people nowadays, and there are especially many kind-hearted smart people, so everyone is a great old man, and the world is very peaceful. As for stupid people, of course there are still some, but there are very few. They have no place to live, which is their own fault. Who asked them not to understand the three-part song of blowing, patting, and stepping?

Stupid people are simply the remnants and waste of the world. Wouldn't the world be even more spacious without them, allowing smart people to walk freely and enjoy themselves? In all fairness, smart people should not give these stupid people a place to live, and of course, they should not leave them a place to stand. Some smart people are still willing to give them a position under their feet, so that they can live. Such smart people, are they not kind-hearted?

Smart people say that heaven and earth are broad, which is very good. Isn't it that they themselves have a place to live, and even stupid people have a place to stand because of them! Amitabha, smart people are both smart and kind, which is rare!

A Mid-Length Novel

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

"Town Chief Chen died for all the people in our town, and also for the country and the nation. We should all respect him. In addition, I hope that you will all report the heroic deeds of the compatriots who died in this incident to the best of your knowledge. I believe that although the supreme leader is currently busy arranging military affairs, he will soon order the collection of these heroic deeds, and then I can report them and request commendation and compensation."

The funeral was held, and then the memorial week and lectures began. Regiment Commander Ye's expression became even more solemn. He said in a very calm voice:

"We must all always remember this bloody lesson. Why were the enemies able to capture Hepu Town so quickly? It is nothing more than because we still have major weaknesses and cannot achieve the effect of military-civilian cooperation. The creation of this weakness is due to the fact that in the past, our general public did not take the interests of the country and nation as a prerequisite, but only knew how to be selfish and seek temporary security. They did not know that personal interests and property are entrusted to the country and nation. If the country and nation are not protected, how can personal interests and property be protected? You see, Yang Yueliang, this miser, is a good example. He desperately hid his silver, but the enemy took it all away. Not only could he not enjoy it, but he also lost his life. Such a death is really disgraceful! Are you willing to die so disgracefully?" (The crowd shouted: "We are not willing to die like that.")

"Therefore, from now on, everyone must wash their minds and change their ways and start again, taking the interests of the country and nation as a prerequisite in everything. We must know that personal life is limited, and the life of the country and nation is infinite. If a person comes into this world and only cares about living a comfortable life for themselves, they are really the most useless people. Only those who can sacrifice themselves for the country and nation are great heroes and great men. Remember, Chairman Chiang has two good sayings: 'The purpose of life is to improve the life of all mankind, and the meaning of life is to create the life that continues the universe.' I hope you will all always remember these two sentences, strive to serve the war of resistance, create benefits for others, and do not only care about yourselves. Only in this way will you not have lived in vain." (Applause enthusiastically)

After the lecture, the flag-raising ceremony was held. The flagpole had already been erected in the square. In the melodious sound of military music, the flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth began to slowly rise to the top of the flagpole. Regiment Commander Ye led the crowd in the highest salute to the national flag, and then they all shouted: "Long live the Republic of China!" "Long live Chairman Chiang!" "Long live the victory of the War of Resistance!"

In this high shout, the bright and beautiful flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth, facing the dawn wind, fluttered, as if expressing its unwillingness to only occupy the small space of Hepu Town, but to fly to every corner of China.

(The End)

### Prayer

— Jinxi

On the green wilderness,

The farmers have green sorrow.

In front of the wandering sacred fire,

They are praying:

"What day,

Will the lovely soldiers,

Suddenly appear again,

Surround and annihilate

Those beasts,

Those enemies?"

The children woke up in their dreams,

Shouting:

"Dad, Mom,

I saw them coming!

A piece of blue sky."

The rustling sound of the wind outside the window

Is like the sound of millions of people

Cheering.

### Why Refuse to Accept One-Yuan Legal Tender?

— You Cong

Recently, because there are many "one-yuan legal tender" notes on the market, and the supply exceeds the demand, the financial market is somewhat tired of "one-yuan legal tender" notes. According to the Shen Bao on the 26th, some banks and money shops in this city have even refused to accept one-yuan legal tender notes. For large sums of money, merchants and citizens who have to pay the money are required to exchange the one-yuan banknotes for five-yuan or ten-yuan notes themselves. This is really an illegal act, and we cannot help but bring it up to chat about it.

First of all, we want to talk about the explanation of the two characters "legal tender". Few people mentioned the two characters "legal tender" four or five years ago. It was not until November 4, 1935, when our Ministry of Finance promulgated the "New Currency Law", that these characters often appeared. In general, self-proclaimed modern ladies always shout "legal tender" at every turn, simply treating it as a synonym for "banknotes", and it has become a fashionable catchphrase. This is somewhat of a misinterpretation. Now we want to discuss the problem that "one-yuan legal tender notes must not be refused," so we should fundamentally start from the two characters "legal tender."

Most people think that legal tender means banknotes, and some people think that legal tender is synonymous with national currency, but both are wrong. Originally, legal tender is a country's "standard currency," which has the qualification of "unlimited legal tender," unlike "subsidiary currency," which only has the qualification of "limited legal tender." The so-called "unlimited legal tender" means that no matter how large a debt under the national law, if the debtor uses "legal tender" to repay it, then the creditor must not refuse to accept it under any pretext. However, "subsidiary currency," which only has the qualification of "limited legal tender," is different. It can only have the qualification of legal tender within the amount limited by the national law. In other words, if the debtor uses all "subsidiary currency" to repay a large debt (exceeding the amount limited by the national law), then the creditor can refuse to accept it according to the law and ask to exchange it for legal tender before accepting it. Therefore, each country has its own legal tender, and each country has its own specific regulations on "limited legal tender." Before our country's Ministry of Finance promulgated the New Currency Law on November 4, 1935, silver coins were "legal tender" and milli-dollars were "subsidiary currency." As for the non-circulation of banknotes in various banks, it is a kind of exchange coupon and does not have the qualification of unlimited legal tender. Later, our country implemented the new currency policy, and the New Currency Law was officially promulgated, so it nationalized silver coins and designated the banknotes of the four banks of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank as our country's legal tender (Note: The designation of China Farmers Bank banknotes as legal tender was newly stipulated after the New Currency Law was promulgated). In other words, except for the banknotes of these four banks, none of them have the qualification of unlimited legal tender, and corner tickets and nickel coins are naturally subsidiary currencies. Regarding the specific regulations on limited legal tender, our country has long had a clear order: "Five-corner subsidiary currency is limited to 20 yuan, two-corner subsidiary currency is limited to 5 yuan, and one-fen and five-fen subsidiary currency are limited to one yuan." Therefore, if this limit is exceeded, then the receiver can refuse to accept it. As for the one-yuan, five-yuan, and ten-yuan banknotes of the four banks of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank, since the government has clearly designated them as "legal tender," then they are naturally good currency with "unlimited legal tender." From as little as one yuan to as much as ten thousand, all can be repaid with "legal tender," and no one may refuse to accept it.

It can be seen that from the perspective of national law, one-yuan legal tender notes must absolutely not be refused. Moreover, we can also explain it from the silver and money industry itself. Article 5 of Chapter 4 of the Shanghai Banking Industry Regulations also clearly stipulates that "all receipts and payments shall be made in national currency in accordance with the Ministry Order of the Ministry of Finance on November 4, 1935." Article 5 of Chapter 4 of the Shanghai Money Industry Regulations also stipulates that "all receipts and payments shall be made in national currency in accordance with the Ministry Order of the Ministry of Finance on April 6, 1933." (Note: The Money Industry Regulations should be revised in accordance with the Banking Industry Regulations for this article). In fact, national currency has a broader scope than legal tender, which means that it also includes subsidiary currency. Therefore, the refusal of some banks and money shops in this city to accept one-yuan legal tender notes is both a violation of national law and a failure to abide by the industry regulations of the same industry.

The New Currency Law concludes by saying: "...It is hoped that the people of the whole country will understand this purpose and abide by it consistently...If there is deliberate obstruction or spreading of rumors...the law will be strictly enforced without any leniency..." Article 8 of the Central Bank Exchange Coupon Regulations (promulgated by the National Government in November 1928) says: "Anyone who counterfeits Central Bank exchange coupons or destroys the credit of exchange coupons shall be punished according to the law of Germany."

"Why refuse to accept one-yuan legal tender notes?" I want to ask.

Ballad of the Gengzi National Crisis

Written by Li Boyuan. Published by the World Prosperity Newspaper House in the Renyin year of Guangxu (1901). It narrates the events of the Gengzi National Crisis and is the masterpiece of late Qing ballads. The entire book consists of forty chapters. It includes a preface, stating the creative motivation: "…Once the peace agreement was reached, the situation changed drastically. The habits of extravagance and debauchery returned to people's hearts. The practice of perfunctory work and evasion of responsibility still prevailed in the world. It was almost as if times had changed, the world was different, and feelings had shifted. Therefore, the author created the Ballad of the National Crisis." It is a work with feeling, not just a poetic history.

Strong Words of the Boxer Rebellion

Written by Tanxi Sheng. Published in the Xinhai year of Xuantong (1911) as a lithograph, consisting of two volumes of twenty books and two books. It includes illustrations. The full title is "Illustrated Secret Novel of the Boxer Rebellion." In fact, this is a reprint of the first half of the "Ballad of the Gengzi National Crisis," with the author's name often changed by the bookstore.

Ballad of the French Heroine

Written by Wan Ci Ren. Published by the Xiaoshuo Lin Society in the Jia Chen year of Guangxu (1904). It tells the story of Madame Roland. The entire book consists of ten chapters, in one volume. A poem at the beginning reads: "Ah, the beautiful woman is pitiful, her rouge and powder are worn out in the service of the country. Who buys seventy thousand strings of incense, everyone vying for the female hero." Another poem says: "European winds and ink rains are boundless, the female world is silent and lacks spirit. Don't say the Jianghao brush has lost its tip, spring comes and new flowers of freedom bloom." There are also two opening poems, one of which says: "The affairs of the vast Middle Kingdom are sad, do you know that the people's strength is exhausted? The ruler and the illustration are full of mixed colors, and the three classes of society are half drunk and happy. I sadly wipe away a tear, and a thousand people call me crazy. I only care for the children in the red window, reading ballads by lamplight every night."

A Stern Awakening

Written by Chen Tianhua. A propaganda pamphlet for the Qing Dynasty revolutionary party, later included in "Manchu-Han Miscellany" compiled by Si Hanzi. It is an anti-Manchu work, enumerating the sins of the Manchus occupying the Han people's land for over two hundred years, the crisis of China, and urging everyone to drive out the Manchus for self-salvation. Each singing section is followed by an explanation, with more prose than singing. The opening verse says: "The great land has fallen for hundreds of years, the flames of war rage and blood flows. It breaks my heart to recount the past, who among our compatriots will avenge this shame?" Then comes a section saying, and then the main text begins: "I take up the clapper and drum, sit in the long street, and sing loudly. Listen closely, fellow compatriots, listen carefully. Our China was originally a famous and great nation. Not like those small lands, remotely located in the periphery..."

Ballad of Civilization Lamp in the Women's World

The topics are: "Establishing Education," "Natural Feet," "Recreation," "Superstition," "Child Brides," "Breaking Prison," "Tea Party," "Rejecting Contracts." It is a work for the women's world at that time. It opens with a "West River Moon" verse: "Pushing to the East and West worlds, dividing the North and South flags. A bare brush writes new words, forming a history of freeing slaves. Let's bring the beautiful fruits of civilization, and transfer them to the new branches of China. Unquenched spirit supports bitterly, only for the women of our compatriots."

Ballad of Awakening the World with Karma

Written by Qu Ge Bian Su Ren. Published in the Gui Mao year of Guangxu (1903) as an "Illustrated Novel" edition. Also titled "Acupuncture for Common Ears." It is a ballad of enlightenment education from the late Qing Dynasty, an anti-superstition work. The unprinted opening poem says: "Evening drum and morning bell awaken the great world, leisurely and unaware of the years. Boundless Buddhist law points to equality, practicing Zen with the master to reach the supreme vehicle." It also says: "I also know that equal teachings are difficult to implement, a colorful brush composes a wonderful new ballad. Fortunately, I still have a three-inch tongue, waiting to see the nod when the stubborn stone nods."

### Random Thoughts on "A Record of the Film City"

— Sijing

At this time last year, we heard that Mr. Chen Kengran was going to make a film set in a photography studio, and the title was already set as "Floating Clouds on the Silver Sea," but later he changed it to "Woman." The current "Record of the Film City" is said to have taken the outline of "Floating Clouds on the Silver Sea," but the content is completely different. For example, the ending in the current "Record of the Film City" and the male lead's jealousy, causing the female lead to jump off the building and commit suicide; when the camera pulls back, it turns out to be filming a scene, this most dramatic ending is almost an overturn of "Floating Clouds on the Silver Sea."

From a "business perspective," there are indeed many British films with photography as the background, but they are still rare in domestic films, and the audience of American films and domestic films seems to have a very obvious distinction, so works like "Record of the Film City" naturally still have their "business sense." How the strong wind is made, how the heavy rain falls, and what is used to replace snowflakes, when watching "Record of the Film City," I heard many viewers feel novel and shocked. And inside there is a very moving love triangle story: the director and the male lead compete for the love of a female lead. Sure enough, there may be a hint of irony in this, such as when the ending camera pulls back, it is filming a scene, and the screenwriter says: "The play is basically a play!" But this ironic meaning is very weak. At most, it exposes the faces of certain people.

Speaking of exposure, there is a scene in "Record of the Film City" that is worth mentioning: after the female lead is injured while filming on location, because the work of the photography studio cannot be stopped, the director uses the "promoting new talent" as a major topic to persuade the production director. Naturally, the production director also has his own reasons: "For the sake of appeal, the company cannot employ a person without acting experience to serve as the protagonist. But the facts are in front of us, are holding on to a few 'old people' still able to have appeal? On the contrary, what is the appeal of many new people? And, if we are not forgetful, isn't the advertisement in the newspaper for the protagonist of a certain film a strong proof? Therefore, even for one's own sake, we should actively train and promote new people. This is actually not a 'big topic,' history is cruel!"

Mr. Chen Kengran's directing technique is relatively advanced, except that the charity entertainment show for disaster relief is too long, (in fact, the insertion of this charity entertainment show is also very abrupt, why not emphasize the original intention of this scene, but only use such a lengthy performance to "satisfy" the audience? This is the self-satirical chapter of "Record of the Film City.") He pulls the emotions of the entire play very tightly.

Many scenes that use clever tricks are also very natural. For example: when Lu Ming receives a letter from Li Ying's house and cries, Wen Yiming thinks that his drinking is the reason why his daughter is sad and throws away the wine glass, and when Wang Naidong brings a gun to look for Li Ying, Lu Ming rushes to make a phone call, and Li Ying answers the phone with a friend inviting him to dinner, etc. The final ending is naturally the most prominent of the clever tricks.

Lu Ming and Wang Naidong's performances are both adequate.

Chapter 7: Paired Swallows and Orioles Reflect the Jade Wall, Yue Silk and Wu Brocade are Woven into Seven Clouds

However, Ms. Wang does not understand, but for a moment, moved by emotion, she seems somewhat reluctant to part. The five-year-old girl, upon hearing that her parents are going to take her out of the hospital and leave Ms. Wang, also cries incessantly. Because her own biological mother also often comes to see her, but after all, she only comes once or twice a month, which is not as often as Ms. Wang's visits. On the day of discharge, the girl hugged Ms. Wang's leg, with tears and snot, crying without end. Ms. Wang comforted her, stroking her hair with one hand, her tears falling like broken strings of beads. Many people who saw it helped them shed tears as well. Later, the girl's father said, "Since they are so reluctant to part, let's ask the hospital to keep her for another year." It is said that it is not only Ms. Wang, but many other nannies and the children they raise are reluctant to separate. In short, when a child separates from their nanny, both sides will always cry. Now, the two Misses He saw that several infant rooms were run by nannies. Some could already walk, some were still learning to walk, some could already speak, some were just learning to speak, some were sleeping, and some were smiling at people. In these infant rooms, you only heard the children's laughter, not their crying. There were also two infant rooms that were for children under one year old, who were taken care of with special care. It is said that the mortality rate of young children is highest in all age groups, so Dr. Lao Zhang paid special attention. As for those even younger, those born within three months, those babies were protected in the infant room of the Women and Children's Hospital and were not sent to the Infant Care Institute for the time being. The two Misses He finally came to the room of the triplets. It turned out that this was a special room, and this nanny was in charge of the three little babies. The nanny's surname was Kang, and her given name was Ning, and she was originally a nurse at the Women and Children's Hospital. Dr. Lao Zhang specially hired her because she was careful, hardworking, and her temperament was very gentle. Ms. Kang Ning was also very happy, this was a great honor, when people asked who was raising these three little babies? They would point her out. But the responsibility was also heavier than that of other nannies. If one of the three children suddenly felt a little uncomfortable today, it would make Ms. Kang Ning anxious, and she would not have a moment of peace in her heart. Fortunately, these three children were more obedient to her than to their own mother, and they listened to her in everything, which made Ms. Kang Ning entrust all her spirit to them. (74)

### The Entertainment World's Movement to Relieve Child Refugees

— Jinding

Written before the Fourth of April Children's Day

Due to the prolongation of the Sino-Japanese war and the expansion of the war zone, the number of refugees coming to Shanghai to seek refuge has also increased day by day; at the same time, the number of child refugees has undoubtedly increased to a huge number! Therefore, how to relieve these many child refugees wandering on isolated islands has become a noteworthy issue.

The Shanghai Eighth Celebration Children's Day Preparatory Committee is conducting intensive preparations for the upcoming Fourth of April Children's Day; in addition to sending letters to major companies and stores, requesting donations of Children's Day gifts, so that they can be distributed to various child welfare institutions and refugee reception centers on Children's Day, the committee also sent letters to the entertainment world, asking them to increase the Children's Day celebration programs on Children's Day, and to provide free admission to refugee reception centers and allow child refugees to watch movies in cinemas, so that these poor child refugees can receive spiritual comfort. From the perspective of relieving child refugees, we feel that this move has considerable significance and value.

However, in my humble opinion, the entertainment world's movement to relieve child refugees should be expanded and made more practical. If we only increase the celebration programs on Children's Day, and treat child refugees favorably by providing free movie tickets, then the effectiveness of the work will not be great. We hope that the entire entertainment world, in addition to the above two tasks on Children's Day, will also donate two or three tenths of the regular income to the child refugee reception centers or child welfare institutions as funds for relieving child refugees. If this can be done, then the child refugees can truly receive practical benefits.

In addition, such as the addition of stimulating slogans for relieving child refugees in movie theaters, the insertion of dialogues about relieving child refugees in theatrical plays, the addition of opening chapters about relieving child refugees on broadcasting stations, and the propagation of the suffering of child refugees by storytellers... all of these can directly or indirectly stimulate the sympathy of the general public, and will invisibly increase the great power for the relief of child refugees.

Work hard! The entertainment world's movement to relieve child refugees.

### Chatting about Opera at Chunjiu Lu

—

In the past, the Sanqing and Sixi two major Huiban opera troupes in Beiping often had different lyrics for the same opera. Later, Tan Xinpei took the lead in the opera world. Thus, the influence of the Sanqing troupe's scripts began to spread north and south. However, the merits of the Sixi scripts are also indelible. The old Sixi troupe had Zhang Kuiguan and Wang Jiuling in the front, and Sun Juxian and Liu Jingran in the back. Their scripts were mostly different from today's preparatory school. Zhang Kuiguan was good at whole plays, such as "The Satisfactory Marriage" and "Ying Daqiu," which are famous scripts among them. After Zhang Kuiguan's death, the head lecturer of whole plays was Liu Jingran. After Jingran's death, I don't know where they flowed. It's a pity.

Between the Tongzhi and Guangxu years of the late Qing Dynasty, there were two whole plays, "Lotus Pond" and "Celebrating Anlan," compiled by He Jingyu. Jingyu was imprisoned in the Ministry of Justice due to an incident. Bored in prison, he used this to pass the time. The lyrics of the plays were mostly allegorical, and they were deeply moving. At that time, they were called masterpieces. I lived in Beiping and searched everywhere for them, but I never got to read them.

Xinpei's plays mostly followed Sanqing, but there were many reforms. In the Xinyou year of the Republic of China, Wang Youchen performed at the Yi Stage and had a very close relationship with me. His wife was Xinpei's daughter. She once told me that Xinpei only personally taught Youchen one play, "The Broken Secret Stream." All the others were obtained by Youchen's own pondering. Therefore, he cannot be completely the same as Xinpei. She also said that Shuyan's play was only "Taiping Bridge," which was personally taught by Mr. Tan. All the others were learned from Wang Changlin. Therefore, he is also different from Xinpei. At that time, Youchen was learning "Zhu Lian Village" from Zhang Rongkui. His wife did not approve of it very much. She said to me, "In the past, there was a 'Three Great Sages' excerpt. The original lyrics had fifty-six sentences. My father always sang this excerpt when he warmed up his voice. Because he was deeply immersed in it, he could remember it." (The original lyrics will be published tomorrow)

During the Tongzhi and Guangxu years, it was the time of the ZTE Restoration. The atmosphere was simple and unadorned. The actors were healthy and full of energy. When they sang plays, they would often sing hundreds of sentences. They did not advocate fancy tunes, but the rhythm was like coming from the heavens. The listeners were never tired of hearing them, but only worried that there would be too little. In recent times, the atmosphere has become thin and people's hearts are impetuous. They only love to listen to fancy tunes, like the flattering of villains. And nine out of ten actors are trapped by opium and women. Their inner Qi is not sufficient. They can only use fancy tunes to please people. And the listeners are also mostly mediocre people with low appreciation ability. These people are full of fat and indulgence, and they don't know what music is. Therefore, it goes worse and worse. The ancient sounds can no longer be heard.

### Records of Silver Screen Storms

— Sha

Xu Xinfu has been busy recently preparing to shoot "Chen Chali Returns to China for the Second Detective Case." There are many gimmicks in the play, and it will definitely be more exciting than the first episode.

Wu Cun's "Tears of Song" was screened at the Jincheng Theater last night. The success of the singing scenes has set a record for domestic productions. Gong Qiuxia's acting skills are also exceptionally excellent, and it may be released in early April.

Huang Tianzuo, the former deputy director of the Central Photography Studio, has come to Shanghai to do business after retiring.

Liu Qiong is currently the best actor, and recently starred in Li Pingqian's "Golden and Silver World."

Yuan Shaomei decided to join the Datong Film Studio on June 1st, starring in "The Sensual History of a Dancer" directed by Gong Jianong. Her personal experience is sure to have gimmicks.

The protagonist of Guohua's new film "The Sensual History of Su San," Liu Zhonghao, has agreed with Wu Cun to hire Gong Qiuxia to play the role. It is said that Zhang Shichuan also agrees very much, because Zhang has always been very fond of Gong.

Fang Peilin has been working hard on the three episodes of "The Incarnation Girl." It is expected that the business of this episode will not be inferior to "Wu Zetian," but the scenery will be slightly inferior.

Zheng Xiaoqiu is stepping up the work on "The Pearl of Night." This gentleman's directing technique has the demeanor of the old master Zheng Qiu.

Wang Yin's directorial debut "Desperate Fugitive" has a very good title. The content is unknown. If it has the spirit of "The Escape" back then, it will be worth watching.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City's Liyuan in the Old Capital (134)

— Xu Muyun

So Kongming thought about it and thought that the time to destroy Cao was still early, so it was better to let him return to Beijing temporarily. On one hand, he first occupied Jingzhou and took Changsha and Wuling, step by step cultivating strength and expanding territory, until he took Chengdu and the great plan to enter Sichuan was completely completed, so that he could have a situation where he could attack when advancing and defend when retreating, and then plan to attack Cao. We can see that after Cao usurped the Han, he was so diligent in conquest, (Six Excursions to Qishan, Nine Expeditions to the Central Plains,) and he was so active in advancing, that we can know that he, Lao Guang, had no worries at all. Because when he released Cao in the first place, he hoped that the Cao family would usurp the throne. The infamy of usurping the throne has already been taken by the Cao family, and at the same time, the Han family's world has already perished. At this time, Kongming protected the young master and snatched the country back from the Cao family, first destroying Wei and then destroying Wu, striving to have the world in his arms, and righteously supporting the young master to ascend the throne. At this time, who can say that he usurped it? People often say "borrow a knife to kill people," but Kongming's trick can be regarded as "borrowing people to test the knife." To sum it up in one sentence, "Releasing Cao at Huarong Road was to keep him for usurping the Han in the future, and to let the Cao family and his son take the blame." Although it is only a difference of a turn of the hand, the origin of the young master's title is very different from that of the Cao family. Unfortunately, heaven's will belonged to Jin, and the Sima family, being close to the water, took this step first, which made Mr. Zhuge hate Jiuquan, and this can be regarded as his futile effort."

Thirteen Sisters Examine Kin and Nian Gengyao Respects Teachers

Now, the role of Dan in "Thirteen Sisters" mostly follows the Yaoqing school. Among the four famous Dans, Xun Huisheng's performance of this play is the best, because he is good at Dao Ma, and the Beijing Bai recitation is fluent and pleasant to listen to. Therefore, after Yu Zhuang Yaoqing, he should be regarded as the first choice. Among the Kun Dans, I have seen Xue Yanqin perform the complete "Thirteen Sisters." Her voice was originally sweet and mellow, and there was a kind of water sound mixed in it, so in addition to the good recitation, the long singing after the memorial service was also very exciting. The main intention of this "Romance of Heroes and Heroines" is also in the word "filial piety." An Longmei had to save his father from difficulty, so he was far away from his hometown, regardless of the dangers along the way, and took two thousand taels of silver to rescue his family. As a weak doctor who had never been out of the house, he dared to make this attempt, which also shows that he was driven by the word "filial piety" and did not take all the dangers to heart.

### Snippets in the Broadcasting Circle (2)

— Bihua

Later, Chen Dabe suddenly became happy and came to try broadcasting work. Of course, Chen Dabe is a pioneer in drama, and he has a good mind, so how could Gu Leiyin be able to match him? After Chen Dabe ran to the radio station to broadcast the Guanyin opera (which was his unique name on the radio station), as expected, the broadcast was very popular with the audience. At that time, Gu Leiyin was almost defeated by him. People who used to like to listen to Gu Leiyin's drama all loved to listen to Chen Dabe's Guanyin opera. After a short period of time, who knew that Chen Dabe's Guanyin opera would unexpectedly fail, and finally could not maintain it and dispersed. There are two reasons for this: one is that Chen Dabe's script for the Guanyin opera was too profound and difficult to popularize. People who are qualified really love to listen to it, but after all, the audience of radio is mostly ladies, so they still listen to "Pearl Tower" and "A Match Made in Heaven by Three Smiles"! The second is that his broadcasting price was too expensive and he was unwilling to compromise. Therefore, it was difficult to develop. It seemed like a flash in the pan and disappeared.

After Chen Dabe's Guanyin opera left, Li Changjian's Wen Sheng opera came. The nature was similar to Chen Dabe's. It really made me sweat for him that Li Changjian, who was not a drama practitioner, dared to come out boldly to broadcast Wen Sheng opera. Although he had been on stage, after all, he was a guest performer, and it could be said that he was a drama amateur. He actually went into the sea, and not on the stage, but on the radio. His courage is really not small. What is especially commendable is that he can play several roles by himself, and can speak dialects from various places, very fluently and pleasantly. It is said that if he does not make a sound, he is already a hit. Now he has occupied a considerable position in the broadcasting world, and the three words Wen Sheng opera have long been deeply imprinted in the minds of the audience. His scripts are mostly written by himself, and they are elegant and popular, and they can cater to the psychology of women, which is his strength. He can write a good hand, and print the scripts he has compiled into books and sell them to the audience, while giving away couplets written in his own handwriting. In this way, he has made a lot of connections, and I really admire his cleverness. He is also a member of our Story Broadcasting Research Association. He is very hardworking and not afraid of difficulties, which is his strength.

### The "Lute Song" Double Case Solved

— Yinsi

Guohua's "Zhao Wuniang" voluntarily cancelled

Permission is granted to Xinhua to film exclusively

"The Lute Song" is a famous Kun opera, which tells the story of the separation and reunion of Cai Bojie and his wife. It is a folk tale that promotes the old etiquette. The plot is sad and tortuous. The Pi Huang opera that performs this play is called "Zhao Wuniang," and it is basically the same, without any difference. Not long ago, Xinhua Company decided to use it as a play material and adapted it into a costume film; then Chen Dabe started writing the script, and Chen Yanyan was selected to play the protagonist Zhao Wuniang, preparing to start filming in a short period of time. At that time, Guohua Company also had such a filming plan, and they posted an advertisement in the newspaper, 'Recruiting actors for the filming of "Zhao Wuniang"', which inevitably caused Xinhua to be surprised, forming a conflict. Because "The Lute Song" and "Zhao Wuniang" unexpectedly followed the same route, it would be obviously detrimental to business in the future. Xinhua initially planned to start filming this film in advance, and immediately changed it to a Huaxin Company production, and transferred it to Xinguang Theater for screening. By doing this, they would take the lead and avoid a direct conflict with Guohua's "Zhao Wuniang," which was also affiliated with Jincheng Theater. Later, Guohua ultimately gave priority to the friendship of the same industry, and learned that Xinhua's "Lute Song" was announced earlier, so it expressed its willingness to concede to Xinhua, and completely abandoned the original plan for "Zhao Wuniang," granting Xinhua permission to film it. This is how they were happy with each other and reached a resolution. And the Zhao Wuniang on the screen will also be "only one of a kind, and there is no division," and there will be no such amusing double-case scene.
