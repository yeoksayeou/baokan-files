Editorial

### On the General Counteroffensive

For more than ten days, the news of the Chinese army's general counteroffensive has been widely spread. According to dispatches from various sources: In Suiyuan, the Chinese army attacked Bailingmiao; in Shanxi, it captured Xiaxian and pressed Wenxi; in Shandong, it fought in Taierzhuang; in Henan, it captured Kaifeng and besieged Xinyang; in Jiangsu, it attacked Yixing; in Anhui, it captured Suxian; in Hubei, it crossed the Xiang River and besieged Zhongxiang, Yangzi, and Pingjing Pass; in Jiangxi, it fought over Gao'an and pressed Wuchang and Wuning; in Guangdong, it captured Huaxian and besieged Zengcheng. These are all the results of the battles in the past week. Such a phenomenon was not seen in the initial battles. It is not only the Chinese who are happy to tell each other that the general counteroffensive is indeed extraordinary, but also many newspapers of friendly countries believe that the entire situation will be completely changed in a few weeks. Having endured the war for twenty-one months, the stability of the people's hearts and the vigor of morale have shown the absolute possibility of a protracted war, and they deeply believe that the final victory is as certain as holding a contract, which is difficult and valuable for any country that has suffered a great disaster. However, it is also natural to hope for an early victory. Therefore, after the widespread news of the general counteroffensive, followed by the successive good news from various places, there is even more vitality. However, the passion of patriotism is not aroused by stimulation; what maintains passion is a calm reason. As far as we know and feel, China's general counteroffensive should still be awaited and has not yet begun.

There are two ways for China to win: Japan's internal collapse, one of them. There are three ways for internal collapse: one is the decline of the military and civilian mentality, from war-weariness to the surface and active actions of anti-war; the second is the exhaustion of public and private economies, internal bankruptcy of all industries, exhaustion of tax sources, social upheaval, and government disintegration, external failure to continue military payment; the third is military failure, military strategic failure, depletion of military equipment, and decline of military discipline. If one of the three exists, it will not be able to continue its aggression, and defeat and death will follow; then China will win. China's strength, the second. In other words, without waiting for Japan's internal collapse, the Chinese side will strengthen its strength through military training, military equipment, and enhanced strength. Crushing strong enemies; then, with a sound of general counteroffensive, sweeping away foreign invaders and restoring rivers and mountains. Therefore, China's victory depends on three factors of the opponent's internal collapse and one factor of its own strengthening; that is, expecting victory from the general counteroffensive is only one end of the expectation, not the only expectation.

Saying that the internal collapse is on their side and strengthening ourselves is the only thing we should seek. This is the most self-denying statement. Looking back on the initial war of resistance up to now, what the Chinese authorities have been most committed to is indeed this. As far as we have heard, regarding the army, the replenishment of the front line is certainly supplemented as much as necessary; and the training of new troops is trained as much as possible; therefore, the actual strength exerted on the front line is not the highest degree of strength, and what is stored in the rear is an inexhaustible main force. Regarding military equipment: After years of internal strife in China, the armies were all formed by indiscriminate recruitment and crude compilation. Having guns and bullets meant being a soldier, and gathering soldiers meant forming a team or an army. Therefore, apart from guns and bullets, there was almost no military equipment; only a few units had relatively complete equipment and training standards. Before the start of the War of Resistance, there was not much time to plan for the replenishment of military equipment; and now, two years later, new military equipment and heavy military equipment have been continuously imported, accumulating into a magnificent force, and the proficiency in its use cannot be achieved overnight, but it can indeed progress with each passing day, and it can be greatly completed after a few months. When the army training is completed and the military equipment is greatly completed, then it can be counterattacked and victory can be guaranteed. This is what is called seeking ourselves. The period is not far away. But not now.

Furthermore, the so-called internal collapse on their side, in fact, the matter of promoting its collapse is still here, not there. After China's twenty-one months of war, although it has not yet collapsed, whether psychologically, economically, or militarily, it has long been marching towards the path of collapse. Without going into detail about the distant past, even after the Chinese army withdrew from Wuhan, Japan, after four months of rest and adjustment, obtained Nanchang at a great sacrifice; what they sacrificed was like paying to the east, and what they progressed was of no great significance. Moreover, when the proportion of space and time is taken into account, its momentum is like the end of a strong crossbow, far from the initial invasion. There is still a distance between its decline and its internal collapse; and the recent actions taken by the Chinese army in various places are aimed at shortening this distance. Under this action, the battle results are as described above, which is indeed gratifying; however, the value does not lie in recovery and progress, but in making them unable to defend safely and unable to stand still; making them exhausted and tired endlessly. In this way, their internal collapse will be faster, and the opportunity for China to obtain a total victory will be closer. Recovery and progress, as well as the general counteroffensive, are all stimulating words; but at this moment, rather than saying that stimulation is needed, it is better to say that the greatest determination to endure pain and sacrifice is needed, and the greatest contribution to spending money and effort is needed!

Along the Yuehan Railway line, Xin Street, Dalan, and Guanyao were captured on the 6th. Although the enemy has joined forces to counterattack in recent days, there have been no results. On both sides of the Xijiang River, the area around Xinhui and Jiangmen is still in a state of mixed warfare. The strongholds of Makou, Xinxu, and Dagang have all been decisively captured, with over 300 enemy corpses abandoned. The remaining enemies are currently being mopped up. Over a thousand enemies on Hainan Island, with over twenty tanks, launched attacks towards Anliang Huangzhuang and other places belonging to Ding'an on the 7th and 8th. Our officers and soldiers waited at ease and launched a head-on attack, killing over 400 enemies and destroying six tanks. At the same time, another unit of our army took advantage of the situation to recapture Ding'an City. The enemy's fierce offensive has been greatly thwarted by this major blow.

Northern Jiangxi Front: Over two thousand enemies facing Tang from Nanchang, under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire, launched a fierce attack on us from the evening of the 6th. Our army valiantly counterattacked, engaging in repeated hand-to-hand combat, and fighting fiercely for a whole day and night. The position remained unshaken. By dawn on the 8th, a sudden counterattack was launched, and the enemy fled in panic, escaping north towards Nanchang. The area was recovered, and Gao'an County was also captured at the same time. The enemy retreated towards Fengxin. After a victorious pursuit, Dacheng was recaptured. One side used powerful troops to press towards Fengxin, and the enemy's entire line wavered, scrambling to escape. By noon on the 10th, the enemy launched a large-scale reinforcement counterattack, and the battle situation was fierce. Due to the disparity in numbers, our army in Gao'an still shifted to its original position to encircle and attack the enemy. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties in this battle, and the corpses were piled up like mountains. Over seven thousand enemies in Wuning, with over thirty artillery pieces and over thirty aircraft, continuously counterattacked our attacking troops for days. An extremely fierce struggle took place in the Yan Gang Street area west of the city. Our officers and soldiers, with one against a hundred, relied on an overwhelming and unmatched attacking spirit to inflict repeated heavy blows on the invading enemy. They are currently advancing smoothly.

Hubei-Hunan Front: In Hubei Province, our attacking troops have achieved three major victories this week. Our army in eastern Hubei advanced westward, and after fierce battles for three days from the 6th to the 8th, successively captured Luwang City, Hua'er Bridge, Hekou Town, and Wangjia Shop. They are currently continuing to press southward, encircling and annihilating the remaining enemies in Huang'an City. The vanguard of the attacking Ying Shan and Anlu in northern Hubei, after recovering Haojia'an and Leigong Shop, the enemy trapped in the county town has become a turtle in a jar. They are now continuing to retreat towards Huayuan and Xiaogan. Our army in central Hubei, besieging Zhongxiang, adopted a four-pronged attack formation, capturing Xiaojia Shop east of the city on the 7th, Xinjie west of the city on the 8th, Yangzi Town north of the city on the 9th, and Yuxin River south of the city on the 11th. The enemy stubbornly resisted in the isolated city, and our army braved enemy artillery fire and poison gas, bravely charging and killing, once attacking into the north city on the 9th, killing countless enemies. With the successive capture of key locations in eastern Hubei, northern Hubei, and central Hubei, the enemy in Wuhan is extremely terrified and is currently strengthening fortifications, attempting to put up a desperate fight. In the Yueyang area of northern Hunan, there have been no unusual changes in the war situation. The enemy on Junshan, north of Dongting Lake, was attacked by our troops on the 7th. The enemy stubbornly resisted, relying on the terrain, but was finally captured by the morning of the 8th. The remaining enemies fled back to their boats and escaped.

Shanxi Front: In An'yi, Yuncheng, Yuxiang, and other places in southern Shanxi, the Japanese army, which had attacked Zhongtiao Mountain, was defeated by us last week. On the 8th, over a thousand remnant enemies in Zhangdian Town showed signs of moving again. Our army in the east of the town rushed to attack them fiercely, and the enemy abandoned over 200 corpses and retreated. Over four thousand enemies in Pingyao, Jiexiu, and Lingshi in eastern Shanxi, with many cannons and tanks, attacked Wanghe and Wangtao Town (both in Pingyao) eastward for days. Our army bravely launched an attack, engaging in fierce battles for several days, annihilating a large number of enemies. On the 8th, a part of the enemy army once sneaked into Wanghe, but after a fierce counterattack, the enemy's offensive was greatly thwarted. They are currently facing each other at Wangtao Town, Shimen Street, and Wangfeng Village. Over three thousand enemies in Huo County failed to attack Yangjiazhuang last week. This week, they continued to attack eastward, engaging in a week of bloody battles. The enemy has been completely defeated, with extremely heavy casualties, and their offensive has been thwarted. A part of the enemy between Ningwu and Shenchi in northern Shanxi was ambushed by our army on the morning of the 9th, and the enemy was surrounded. The enemy stubbornly resisted to the death, and after three hours of fierce fighting, most of them were annihilated by us. Over a hundred remnant enemies retreated towards Ningwu. Taking advantage of the victory to pursue, they have already pressed under the city of Ningwu.

In addition, over three thousand enemies in Xinyang, Henan, on the 8th, divided into three routes, one crossing the river from Xishuang River, one towards Yangliu River, and one approaching the vicinity of the Xi River, attacking and breaking through westward, and engaging in fierce battles with our army attacking Xinyang. The fighting on the Yangliu River was particularly fierce. Our army divided and fought bravely, breaking through the enemy's line, and the encirclement circle became increasingly smaller. The remaining enemies in the corner will not be difficult to capture. Near Kaifeng, our army suddenly launched a large-scale attack on the city walls around 1:00 PM on the 11th, completely occupying all the key points and stations in the suburbs of the city. The enemy stubbornly resisted in the city, and our army charged into the city, killing countless enemies. The remaining enemies abandoned their weapons and fled, and the county town was once recaptured by our army. The mixed fighting is still extremely fierce. The enemy in Jintan and Lishui in Jiangnan suddenly increased to over five thousand, with over seventy tanks. On the 7th and 8th, they launched fierce attacks from Tianwang Temple and Lishui in two routes. Our army intercepted them north of Xinqiao in southern Lishui, and the intensity of the battle was unprecedented in that area. Another part of our army circled behind the enemy, cutting off their retreat. The enemy abandoned corpses all over the field. Another part of our army launched a fierce attack on the enemy in Yixing on the 10th. The enemy was caught off guard and fled in droves. We immediately recaptured Yixing. (12th Dispatch)

### Britain and the United States Must Cooperate Practically to Protect Their Interests in the Far East and Take a Firm Stance Against Japan

Remarks by an Australian Parliamentarian

(Hong Kong) Australian parliamentarian Dunnageran, who recently inspected Japan, North China, and Northeast China, returned to Australia via Hong Kong yesterday. According to his observations, he believes that if Britain and the United States want to maintain their interests in the Far East, they must cooperate practically and take a firm stance against Japan as soon as possible. Japan's economic panic is serious, and the people's war-weariness is increasing. He saw Japanese troops departing in Moji, but there were no well-wishers, which was completely different from before. In his opinion, Japan's economy cannot support the war against China. Democratic countries such as Britain, the United States, and France should exert economic pressure on Japan to curb its aggression. He also said that the US policy of isolationism is short-sighted.

### British and French Governments Simultaneously Announce Guarantee of Independence for Greece and Romania

Decide to Offer Full Assistance Should They Face Threats

Consider the Mediterranean Vital and Unwilling to Allow Changes to the Status Quo

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain entered the House of Commons at 5:55 PM and delivered his long-awaited speech on the international situation. The entire House stood and cheered to welcome him. The Prime Minister declared that the events that caused the House to convene early have caused widespread anxiety and disturbance, especially in the Eastern Mediterranean.

The Prime Minister then detailed the events in Albania, saying that the accounts of these events are contradictory, sometimes entirely from one side. The background of these events is also interpreted differently. The Prime Minister then read conflicting detailed reports from both the Italian and Albanian sides, saying that a major power has brandished its power to impose its will on a small and relatively defenseless nation. The government has not yet received information from the British Minister to Albania regarding the events of "Good Friday." The day after the events, the Albanian government appealed to Britain to exert its utmost to "help a small country fight to the death to defend its territory." Regarding the general impact of the Italian military actions, there is no doubt that the world is deeply shocked by this new phenomenon of the wanton use of force, whether directly or indirectly, and the Italian claim that Italian expatriates were suppressed by Albania is widely doubted. The government has lodged a strong protest with the Italian government and has attempted to ascertain Italy's intentions. The Italian government's recent response stated that the future will be determined by the will of the Albanian people.

The Prime Minister continued that the Anglo-Italian Agreement has been ratified and should not be invalidated at this time. He firmly believes that the signing of the Anglo-Italian Agreement was justified, and there is nothing now to change this confidence. The Prime Minister said, "I now express my sincere and deep disappointment at Italy's actions. These actions cast a shadow over the sincerity of Italy's guarantees. The British government feels that it is now imperative to leave no doubt in people's minds about the position of the British government. This is our inescapable and non-negotiable responsibility."

"Therefore, I take this opportunity, on behalf of the British government, to emphasize the great importance we attach to avoiding the disturbance of the status quo in the Mediterranean and the Balkan Peninsula by force or the threat of force. Therefore, the British government has decided that in the event of any clear threat to the independence of Greece or Romania, and the governments of Greece and Romania consider it necessary to resist with their national forces, the British government will feel obligated to immediately assist Greece or Romania with all its strength. France has expressed its agreement to this." (Cheers from the audience.) At the time, some members of the opposition party shouted "Soviet Union." The Prime Minister immediately replied, saying that if I have not mentioned the Soviet Union, it does not mean that we are not currently maintaining extremely close contact with representatives of the Soviet Union. We have a very difficult task before us, that is, we must not only consider what we want ourselves, but also what the people of other countries want. We have no prejudice, no preconceived notions, or ideological opinions. We are now trying our best to command and lead all the forces that uphold peace and are willing to resist aggression, so that our efforts may achieve practical results.

The Prime Minister's speech lasted for thirty-four minutes, and he took his seat at 3:29. The atmosphere in the entire House was extremely tense during the Prime Minister's speech, and cheers were heard from all sides. When the Prime Minister went to the House of Commons from 10 Downing Street, crowds lined the streets and cheered.

During his speech, the Prime Minister revealed that Foreign Secretary Halifax had told the Italian Chargé d'Affaires in London that Britain had no intention of occupying the islands of Greece, but that the British government would take a very serious view if other countries occupied the islands. The Foreign Secretary made these remarks based on a telegram from the British Minister to Greece reporting that the Italian army was inclined to occupy the islands. The Foreign Secretary also told the Italian Chargé d'Affaires that the British government would not misunderstand this point and that it was absolutely crucial. (13th Reuters Urgent Dispatch)

### French Prime Minister Issues Declaration Echoing Britain

(Paris) Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier delivered a radio address to the nation this afternoon, stating that the French government has taken military measures to defend the metropolitan border and colonial empire to cope with all events. He was pleased to note that reservists of all ranks were enthusiastically enlisting. Regarding France's position on the current international situation, I explained it on the 29th of last month. In short, at a time when the European situation is precarious and unstable, France is determined to maintain peace within the framework of freedom and honor. The first step is to strengthen national defense and to strengthen alliances with those nations that are "determined to resist aggression and maintain freedom," especially with the governments of Britain, the United States, Soviet Russia, Poland, and the Balkan Entente countries, namely Turkey, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Greece. Our goal is to convene and cooperate with those nations that have no intention of threatening the vital interests of other countries, are determined to resist all hegemonic attempts, and are willing to openly discuss current issues. We are convinced that this goal can be achieved.

(New York) According to a statement issued today by the Soviet Reserve Bank, gold imported into the United States in March totaled $365 million, the largest figure since the Czech crisis last fall. The total amount imported included the following countries: Britain $250 million, Netherlands $27 million, Belgium $37 million, Switzerland $8 million, and Japan $11 million. Regarding gold imports, it is reported that the US Postal Authorities have issued an order banning the import of gold worth more than $5,000 into the United States by mail or parcel. This order will be implemented immediately, but it does not apply to items already in transit. (12th Reuters)

As for the mutual understanding between Britain and France, its closeness and strength have never been greater. I am now speaking to the nation with the prior consent of both my own government and the British government." Thereupon, Prime Minister Daladier stated that the French government had offered guarantees to Greece and Romania, declaring that if the independence and sovereignty of those countries were threatened, it would assist them with all its strength. (All that was said was the same as that spoken by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the British House of Commons this afternoon.) In addition, the British and Polish governments have mutually accepted obligations, declaring that they will assist each other to defend their independence and sovereignty in the event of direct or indirect threats. The French government is very pleased to learn of this. The current alliance treaties between France and Poland have also been reaffirmed in the same spirit. As soon as the vital interests of both countries are directly or indirectly threatened, they will immediately rise up to help each other. This measure should be communicated to the governments of all concerned countries, especially the government of Turkey. In short, the maintenance of territorial integrity and the security of the colonial empire to cope with all kinds of direct and indirect threats is the right of France. The government is fully aware of the great responsibility in implementing this policy and will fulfill its duties with a firm will and a dedicated determination to complete the destiny of the nation.

### Italy's Attitude Towards Britain Suddenly Softens

Almost Seeking to Leave Room for Maneuvering

Italian Troops in Spain Preparing to Withdraw

(Rome) According to news from here last night, the Italian Navy is fully prepared and ready to depart, but at the same time, Mussolini has suddenly shown a softened stance towards Britain. One instance is the government announcement clarifying that Italy has no territorial ambitions towards Greece, and this intention has been communicated to the Greek ambassador to Italy. Furthermore, the announcement stated that Mussolini has discussed the withdrawal of Italian troops stationed in Spain with senior Italian military officers. There are also reports that Italy promised the withdrawal of Italian troops from Spain long ago, but has not yet fulfilled it. Mussolini's subtle stance seems to be in anticipation of the policy declaration to be issued by Britain and France, hoping that the attitude will not be too severe, leaving some room for maneuvering. (May 13th, Associated Press)

### British Prime Minister During the European War Strongly Advocated that Britain and the Soviet Union Should Establish Military Understanding; The Practical Effect of Resisting Aggression Cannot Be Conveyed by Words; American Newspapers Have Great Foresight and Also Advocate American-Soviet Cooperation

(London) Former Prime Minister Lloyd George of the opposition Liberal Party delivered a speech in Pwllheli, Wales, today, stating that Britain should establish a military understanding with the Soviet Union. Once this understanding is reached, the dictatorial countries will no longer act rashly. After occupying Albania, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini offered a promise to Prime Minister Chamberlain, saying that he would respect the existing legal status of Albania. It is ridiculous that the Prime Minister believed it without a doubt. The following is a selective record of the full text of the speech.

Lloyd George first stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in Birmingham on the 17th of last month, after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, declaring the abandonment of the policy of appeasement and safeguarding freedom and international law in a more resolute manner. It is still difficult to determine whether these words were sincere or just to appease the people. If the Prime Minister's words are not sincere or if he changes his original intention afterwards, the repercussions will be that the likes of Hitler and Mussolini will inevitably resort to violence again. In short, what the Prime Minister's true intention is will be known tomorrow. In my opinion, the Prime Minister's attitude towards the establishment of a practical military understanding between Britain and the Soviet Union can be regarded as a touchstone for whether the Prime Minister is truly aware. The government's current plan is to invite small countries such as Romania, Greece, and Yugoslavia to take risks and join the anti-aggression group. Does it know that this plan, without the support of the Soviet Union, will ultimately be futile? On the contrary, if Britain establishes a military understanding with the Soviet Union and unites the strength of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to jointly resist any aggression by any dictatorial country, the great effect of this cannot be conveyed by words. "However, if Britain and France do not provide practical guarantees and declare that they will not engage in empty talk, the Soviet Union will not cooperate. If we again form an ambiguous alliance, as we have done for many years, the Soviet Union will definitely not participate. This is what I firmly believe. It should be known that after we conclude an anti-aggression alliance with the Soviet Union, we can use the world's most powerful army, the most elite air force, and the richest resources to fight on the front lines that we cannot easily reach. In this way, I dare to assert that no dictatorial country will dare to act rashly again." The government's previous actions were based on three erroneous concepts: (1) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini must remain loyal to the Rome-Berlin Axis; (2) General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, will eventually abandon the dictatorial countries; (3) We still have complete control over the Mediterranean. However, the truth is far from it. The two sides of the Strait of Gibraltar are equipped with heavy artillery from Germany and Italy, and aircraft fields have been built. With Italy occupying Albania and the Spanish Nationalist government joining the anti-Comintern pact, Britain's bases in the Mediterranean have been greatly threatened. "In short, we are surrounded in both the east and west of the Mediterranean. If we delay any longer, maritime traffic will be completely cut off, and our country will be controlled by the aggressor countries. The government has been deceived again and again. If it does not change its course, it will be fooled by clever people again. This must be taken seriously." (May 12th, Havas)

(Washington) The "Washington Post" stated in an editorial today that compromise has failed, and resistance has taken its place. If the Soviet Union and the United States do not act actively and consistently, resistance may be too late. The exaggerations of the dictators will become reality, and the Axis will no longer fear being opposed by Britain and France alone. (May 12th, Reuters)

### Churchill Cautions the Government to Implement a New Diplomatic Policy with Courage and Determination

(London) Churchill, a leader of the far-right wing of the Conservative Party, delivered a speech in Edinburgh this evening, stating that the government should implement a new diplomatic policy with an indomitable spirit. "The new diplomatic policy that we are now implementing focuses on contacting all peace-loving countries and concluding alliances with them to form a peace group to resist aggression. This matter should be pursued with perseverance and determination to move forward in order to be successful. If we abandon it halfway, security cannot be expected, and the psychology of those countries that threaten world peace and hate our country will not be alleviated. To this day, the Anglo-Italian Agreement has been torn up. The only way to deal with it is to organize a collective security system and change the national voluntary service system into a mandatory one." (May 12th, Havas)

### US House Foreign Affairs Committee Heatedly Debates Amending the Neutrality Act, Distinguishing Between Aggressor and Aggressed Nations, Majority Advocates Economic Sanctions Against Japan

(Washington) The Sino-Japanese War was the focus of the House Foreign Affairs Committee's discussion of the Neutrality Act yesterday. Representative Isaacs, a Democrat from California, suggested that "If the United States declares Japan an aggressor, then the United States can prohibit continued trade relations between the United States and Japan until Japan restores the Open Door Policy in China." Fengwick, an expert on the Neutrality Act, suggested that "I agree that the United States should not allow countries that tear up treaties, such as Japan, to pass through the Panama Canal. All bills that support cutting off trade relations with aggressor countries may defeat Japan. If this bill had been implemented earlier, the Sino-Japanese War might not have broken out." Representative Coody Ford, a Republican from Michigan, believes that all measures should not only be applied to Japan, but also to all other aggressor countries. (May 13th, Associated Press)

(Washington) During the discussion of the Neutrality Act amendment in the House Foreign Affairs Committee today, Fenwick, a professor of international law at Bowdoin College in the United States, asked the United States to prohibit the passage of merchant ships of countries that violate international treaties, whether in war or in peace, through the Panama Canal. This measure by the United States will be able to seriously strike "lawless countries" such as Japan, Italy, and Germany. Fenwick also said that if trade relations are cut off with countries that violate treaties, it will surely bring the current Sino-Japanese War to a halt and cause Japan to fail. He strongly supports the resolution proposed by "Thomas" in Congress authorizing the President to declare Japan an aggressor, and asked Congress to find a way to cut off trade relations with Japan as soon as possible. According to him, although the United States will suffer some losses if it cuts off trade relations with Japan, it is a necessary measure to safeguard the rights and principles of the United States. He also said that this action by the United States will not lead to war between the United States and Japan. On the contrary, if the United States remains silent and allows Japan to return fully loaded, the Philippines will soon be controlled by it, and other interests will also be hit. At that time, even if we do not want to fight, we will not be able to avoid it. (May 12th, Associated Press)

### Readjustment of Soviet Policy (Continued)

— Te Ye

Reliance on Nationalism—No Emphasis on Agreements—

The Soviet Union's Capacity for War

During the conflict with Japanese troops in August, each side deployed a division. The Far Eastern Red Army, following instructions from Moscow, engaged in combat on a strictly limited front, demonstrating to the world that the Soviet Union "would never retreat an inch of its own land." This demonstration, while seemingly grand, was purely for show from the perspective of rescuing Czechoslovakia.

If the Soviet Union were to go to war with Germany, Poland, in any case, would stubbornly maintain neutrality, becoming a "Chinese Great Wall" between the two countries. As for Romania, even if the Romanian government were willing to allow Soviet troops passage, it would be of little use from a strategic and logistical standpoint. Therefore, in the initial stages, the Soviet military's activities would be limited to long-range bombing (since Czechoslovakia's position cannot provide the Red Air Force with a base) and submarine patrols in the Baltic Sea to attack enemy ships. However, if the Soviet Union wished, it could deploy a large army in later stages, because changes are unpredictable in a major war, and avenues of advance would open.

Mutual assistance agreements have always been nominal, merely rounds in diplomatic maneuvering. The general staffs of both sides have never held serious talks, so when the crisis arrived, neither the French chargé d'affaires in Moscow, nor the Czech minister, nor even the military attaché at the Czech legation, received a clear explanation of what actions the Red Army was prepared to take.

The Soviet Union's Attitude toward Britain. The Soviet government knows full well that France has no intention of going to war with Hitler for Czechoslovakia, and that Britain will also be the same, so it resolutely decided to initially distance itself from the legitimate efforts of Geneva, seeking, in this regard,  .  Litvinov twice declared in Geneva that the Soviet Union was determined to fulfill its obligations under the Soviet agreement with all available means. This, of course, required France to fulfill its responsibilities as an ally of Czechoslovakia, attacking Germany, before the Soviet Union could do so. In the Soviet view, Czechoslovakia has now become a target for Germany, able to supply Hitler with ten divisions when needed. The situation is hopeless, and all Soviet attitudes toward Western democracies have now become as cold as a frigid spring. The Bolsheviks gnash their teeth at Chamberlain, seeing him as an even greater villain than before, and the Soviet newspapers downplay Britain's efforts. They continue as usual, discussing European events as if the Soviet Union were on another planet. The Moscow authorities believe that Germany's next attack will be directed westward. Their main concern is the Japanese threat, and all military schools are currently undergoing a lesson in silence. "War in the spring."

Eastern European Countries Take the Opportunity to Observe

Some British newspapers have proposed the idea of a coming "friendship" between the Soviet Union and Germany, which has greatly harmed the nerves of Eastern Europe. This strategy only benefits Hitler. If Germany relaxes its armed aggression and prepares to supply the Soviet arms factories with semi-finished materials, and the Soviet Union prepares to supply Germany with important raw materials, then Soviet-German trade, which had fallen to one-seventh of its level before the Hitler era, can be greatly restored. But no matter how much the Soviet Union welcomes the easing of diplomatic tensions, friendship is another matter. Politicians in democratic countries cannot understand the conflict between Soviet and German ideologies. It must be understood that this is not just a matter of loyalty, but a fundamental organizational issue. The organizations of the two countries have always been diametrically opposed. The Soviet Union is well aware that Hitler has [lacuna], and Germany's economic difficulties will soon force Hitler to become active on one side or the other.

The resolution of the Soviet Agreement, France said, "is currently being disinfected," which is true, but this agreement cannot be considered a dead thing. It is currently being subtly hypnotized so that it continues to breathe faintly.

The relations between the Eastern European countries still seem to be as elusive as before. It is difficult to tell which way the "national cat" will jump, and thus be able to show what kind of "cat walk" diplomacy Germany is currently doing in Eastern Europe. No country is willing to make a definite statement. However, exchanges of friendly gestures are currently taking place and being touted between the capitals of Eastern Europe and Moscow. The Soviet Union and the countries on the Black Sea coast have even been exploring the possibility of concluding a "Black Sea Pact." To date, there has been little success. This pact is unlikely to be completed unless Bulgaria joins the Balkan Group.

Poland, angered by Hitler's strange theory of a "Carpathian Ruthenian" ethnicity (the area is actually mostly inhabited by the original "Great Russian" people), has promoted an important trade agreement between the Soviet Union and Poland. Polish newspapers, which previously often used malicious insults against the Soviet Union, have now turned to compliments, saying that "the Soviet Union's manpower and mineral resources are inexhaustible." The Soviet newspapers, however, remain silent. The Poles are rash and warlike, and now seem to be watching the situation on the plain between their hereditary enemy Germany and their former master, the Soviet Union, where there is no defensible area. If Poland cautiously leans towards the Soviet Union and maintains its neutrality, Germany's attempt to invade Soviet Ruthenia will be difficult to realize for a while. However, if Hitler listens to the astute German quartermaster, Germany may invade Soviet Ruthenia through the narrow neck of Romania.

The Red Army's Purges Have Yielded Tangible Results

Hitler's Ruthenian policy has not yet been implemented, "partly due to prudent planning that has already been achieved." He seems to hope that the non-Russian peoples within the Soviet Union will be induced by his "racialist" propaganda to secede from the Soviet Union and become independent. Hitler holds this illusion, but ignores more than a dozen contrary factors. He even turns a blind eye to a recent important event: during the large-scale purges in 1937-38, Stalin preemptively eliminated all the leaders of the non-Russian peoples in the Soviet republics. With this, Hitler, no matter how eloquent, will find it difficult to fulfill his wishes.

The Red Army's purge movement is now a thing of the past. Except for General Bely Rutze in the Far East, who remains in a high position due to his widespread popularity, the soldiers in other areas no longer fear purges. At least two million soldiers read the new oath. Not only must they read it, but they must also sign it, which proves that both those who issue the orders and those who sign the oath know the incredible importance of the signed oath. This can also be proven by the recent government order confirming the new positions of 56 generals who were promoted to the highest command last year. This is the first time the government has issued such an order since the execution of General Tukhachevsky in 1937.

The Soviet army is now in the process of overall strengthening, with several new divisions joining its ranks each month. Approaching the western border are about forty divisions equipped with armaments. The inconvenience of transportation between the border and the interior, and the inelasticity of war potential, will remain the main weaknesses of the Soviet Union. However, the authorities have already stockpiled enough supplies near the border to meet needs for many months, and within three months can easily mobilize 100 divisions of 10,000 regular troops per division concentrated on the western frontier. The Soviet Union is now reverting to the concept of "assembling large corps" for military strategy. The individual glory that may have been lost in the purge is now likely to be compensated by "the glory of the group." Outsiders often scorned what Conrad (a Polish nobleman who hated Russians all his life) called the Russian "cynicism" of relying solely on numbers (meaning those who are arrogant and think the world revolves around them). Russians themselves would often invite this scorn, especially before their great defeat in the war with Japan in 1903-04, when they boasted: "We will suffocate the enemy under Russian hats." However, the Russian nature of "assembling large corps" is indeed one of their strengths. Now that the Soviet army is equipped with modern weapons and has undergone a completely new social organization, they hope to be able to suffocate the "enemy" more confidently than before when needed.

### Foreigners in Hankou: The Japanese Firmly Refuse to Allow Departure; Possible Detention as Hostages if European War Breaks Out; The Drinking Water in the French Concession Will Also Become a Serious Problem

According to the Continental Daily, a foreigner who came to Shanghai from Hankou last week, yesterday (the 12th) told a reporter that the turbulent flow of the Yangtze River has risen to the highest level recorded this season, and the condition of the river dikes is poor, so there is a possibility that Hankou will become a swamp. Whether the early rise in river water will lead to flooding, or whether the torrent will fall before the usual rise in water, cannot be predicted at present. Last autumn, the Chinese army built fortifications on the river dikes, which weakened the dikes' resistance. Strangely enough, while Hankou is encountering this situation, the problem of sufficient water supply in the French Concession is gradually becoming serious. Since the Japanese cut off the connection between the French Concession and the Hankou Municipal Water Plant on the Han River, the residents of the French Concession have been relying entirely on a single pump to draw unfiltered Yangtze River water for survival. Coolies line up in front of the pump all day long, drawing muddy water. This muddy water is all that they can obtain. The lack of clean water and the threat of ever-latent epidemics may cause a serious situation in the summer. However, although the equipment is inconvenient, it is currently possible to obtain sufficient water. Regarding the possible spread of diseases in the hot summer, it is reported that the daily affairs bureau is now fully cooperating, preparing to fight the epidemic. As the clouds of war in Europe grow darker, there are more than a thousand foreigners stranded in Hankou, all of whom may be detained as hostages if war breaks out. When asked why more foreigners have not left Hankou, the foreigner's explanation was quite alarming. It is said that over 130 foreigners have tried to leave Hankou in recent weeks, but the Japanese have resolutely refused to allow them passage. According to the Japanese military, this is due to "the uncertain situation." However, the foreigner and other foreigners in Hankou are convinced that there is a more important reason. Foreigners in Hankou are practically prisoners. If war breaks out in Europe, the Japanese will immediately arrest all the British and other foreign nationals in the area. As for the economic situation in Hankou, business is extremely depressed, and the market is full of Japanese goods. When the foreigner left Hankou, the Japanese authorities ordered foreigners to hand over all [lacuna] refugee shelters within a week. It is not known whether this measure has been implemented.

### Japanese Troops in Qingpu ambushed in night raid

Qingpu dispatch, the Japanese troops in Qingcheng have been repeatedly attacked by guerrilla teams in the four suburbs, so on the 4th, about 300 reinforcements were transferred from Kunshan, attempting to make trouble. On the night of the 6th, a large number of Japanese and puppet troops launched a night raid on the guerrilla teams outside Xiaoximen, apparently to break the communication between the Chinese army at Dianshan Lake and relieve the siege of Zhujia Ge, the chief town. When the Japanese and puppet troops passed Wan Jing Bridge, they were spotted by a guerrilla team sentry, who quickly reported to the troops. Therefore, when the Japanese and puppet troops arrived at Jinjia Bridge, they were ambushed by the guerrilla teams. More than half of the Japanese and puppet troops died. At about 3:00 AM, the Japanese garrison in the city hurriedly drove motorboats to reinforce them, but the Japanese troops had no will to fight and retreated to Qingcheng on the boats. The guerrilla teams, seeing that their goal had been achieved, did not pursue them.

### Suzhou Traitor Sheng Ke'an Executed

Sheng was the head of the puppet Self-Defense Corps. Suzhou dispatch, in Hengjing Town, a county under its jurisdiction, there is a man named Sheng Ke'an, who is a well-known local thug who usually runs rampant in the villages and oppresses the citizens. After the change, Sheng obtained the position of head of the puppet Self-Defense Corps, which made him even more unscrupulous. The day before yesterday (the 9th) morning, Sheng took a boat to Suzhou, and in the afternoon at 1:00 PM, he took the original boat back to Hengjing. When the boat passed Yuexi Town, which belongs to Wujiang County, it suddenly encountered a number of young men, each holding a short gun, who ordered the boat to stop. When the boat approached the shore, four young men disembarked and escorted Sheng ashore. They ordered the boat to weigh anchor, and then fired two shots at Sheng, killing him on the spot. Afterwards, the young men fled in all directions.

### Education Minister Chen Lifu Discusses the Position of Music in Education: Encouraging Young People to Follow It and Advance

(Chongqing Dispatch) Education Minister Chen Lifu recently wrote an article discussing the position of music in education. The original text is as follows:

The goal of education is to cultivate young people with moral, intellectual, and physical education, so that they can achieve this mission. It cannot be denied that what is achieved does not necessarily have to be practical talent, and what is focused on does not necessarily have to be useful learning. The reason is that the effort to practice stillness is used instead of practicing movement, and the effort to implement is spent on learning literature. The crux of the matter can be summarized in one sentence: music has lost its position in education.

In the history of our country, the periods when literature and education were most prosperous must be said to be the Zhou Dynasty. When discussing the saint of teachers for all generations, it must be said to be Confucius. The teachings of the Zhou Dynasty were that the learning and administration of the state were in the hands of rites and music. The teachings of Confucius were that the subjects of instruction were first the Six Arts, and in the Taibo chapter there is a saying "established by poetry, stood by rites, completed by music," then music is the way to complete education. Taken together, the importance of music in education at that time can be seen.

After the Qin and Han dynasties, ancient music was lost, and rites and teachings alone prevailed in the world. The drawbacks were that they emphasized formality and neglected practicality, and were biased towards conservatism and laxity in initiative. Eventually, rites and teachings only remained formal. As a result, rites collapsed and music was ruined, and the foundation of the state was shaken, and the performance of the people declined. Neglecting practicality meant that the sciences of utilizing resources and benefiting people, and new knowledge could not be produced. Old learning was also lost for a long time. Laxity in initiative meant that the nation gradually became old, and society also became lethargic. The country, which was the first to be civilized and had a long history, was then turned around and lagged behind in everything and regressed in everything. What is even more heartbreaking is that various undesirable phenomena, such as depression, dispersal, confusion, and licentiousness, were revealed as weaknesses, and national morality was completely wiped out, so that the country, which had been called the land of rites and music for five thousand years, was almost no longer a country.

Therefore, today, in order to save the crisis of the country and the nation, it is necessary to restore the position of music in education. The original purpose of music is to guide the vigorous vitality of young people and complete it within collective action. The sounds of bells and chimes are different from gold and stone, but they can harmonize in pitch. The dances of thousands of feathers have different styles in civilian and military affairs, but they are orderly in advancing and retreating, just like the personalities of young people. Although they are different, they can cooperate in group life as long as everyone uses their talents to the fullest. Music focuses on movement, and movement results in more development. Rites focus on stillness, and stillness results in the power of stability. The distorted development of past education was not worried about the inability to be still, but worried about the inability to move. Therefore, the promotion of music should be used to invigorate and inspire, to straighten the depressed ranks, to tidy up the scattered ranks, to make advances and retreats uniform, to manage the confused ranks, to make peace and harmony, and to correct the licentious ranks. This will perhaps lead to the cultivation of a habit of moving, the arousal of a love for practical science, the development of practical science, the cultivation of a spirit of initiative, in order to restore the inherent morality of the people and catch up with the ever-changing knowledge and abilities.

The War of Resistance has been going on for twenty months, and the certainty of victory is increasing day by day. The international situation is improving. From the mutual trust of the people, to the strengthening of the nation's self-confidence, and from the nation's self-confidence, to the promotion of the common trust of friendly countries, the development of the spirit of unity is the most important thing. The purpose of music is to attach to all people, because it is deeply moving, and its way comes from nature. Therefore, one singing can lead to a hundred harmonies, and in the process of subtle transformation, it can achieve the effect of responding to the request for sound and qi, and encourage the people, inspire morale, strengthen their loyalty to the common enemy, and create their courage to kill the enemy and achieve results. It is also an urgent need in wartime. The Marseillaise had no small impact on the success of the French Revolution. This is a clear effect that can be seen. Therefore, in response to the needs of wartime, music education must also be promoted urgently.

Therefore, the prosperity of music education led to the flourishing of education in the Zhou Dynasty, and the decline of music education led to the daily increase of the crisis of the nation. The causes and effects are different, but the facts are the same. If education is on the right track, and young people are encouraged to follow it and advance, then music is the driving force. If this is examined, then the position of music in education does not need to be stated in detail.

### Announcement of Opening Dates for Various Grass Tennis Competitions This Year. Grass Court Association to Revise Various Rules. A General Assembly to be Held Again at the West YMCA on the 26th.

The Shanghai Grass Tennis Association held its first committee meeting the other day at the West YMCA. In addition to deciding on the deadline for registration and opening dates for the Group A and B league and championship matches this year, they also discussed the issue of rule revisions. Many revisions were proposed this time, and it was decided that a temporary general assembly of all committee members (not the second committee meeting) will still be convened at the West YMCA on the 26th of this month (Wednesday) to make a decision. The various points of revision raised for discussion at the committee meeting the other day will solicit opinions from members of various associations and clubs and be submitted for discussion at the temporary general meeting. The proposal to adopt a modified double round-robin system for the Group A league was rejected. (According to reports, this proposal was put forward by Klinuo at the last annual meeting and was only for Group A; yesterday's report mistakenly stated it was for Groups A and B.) The committee also resolved to continue to use Slazenger balls as the official balls for this year's competitions. Furthermore, the previous regulation that all weeks of the previous championship, except for the Men's Novice Singles, the remaining Men's Advanced Singles, Men's Doubles, Mixed Doubles, Women's Singles and Doubles, and International Robb Cup Doubles, were to be held at the Association Tennis Courts on Xiafei Road on designated dates, has been cancelled for this year. As the Association Tennis Courts are overused and damaged, and limiting the use to one court affects the progress of the competition, it was decided that for this year's championships, except for the semi-finals and finals, which will be held at the Association Tennis Courts on designated dates, the remaining weeks will still be arranged by the players themselves to compete at various courts. Registration for each competition opens today. The officially announced deadlines for registration and opening dates of each competition by the association are listed below:

Competition Name Deadline for Registration Opening Date Registration Fee

Group A League May 6th June 21st 10 yuan

### Finance: Hong Kong and Xiamen Banks Continuously Purchase, Spot Price Without Glory or Disgrace

Yesterday's spot silver market still showed little change. Throughout the day, it hovered within the 2,070 yuan range, with the sluggish trend showing an initial rise followed by a fall, purely shifting based on the amount of supply and demand. Initially, although silversmiths, gold shops, and money exchanges were selling quite a bit, the American market was generally stable and slightly soft. With strong buying from Hong Kong banks, coupled with Xiamen banks and spot silver shops tracking and purchasing, the underlying trend was relatively stable for a time. Later, when the customer banks stopped buying and the money exchanges continued to sell, the situation turned sluggish. In the end, there was no clear winner or loser. Major local players remained cautious and watched. Trading was quite active in the morning, reaching around 800 taels, but turned quiet in the afternoon, with only 50 taels traded. Silversmiths' jewelry gold rebounded by one yuan. Customs gold was stagnant. Chinese-British pure gold and others rose slightly.

Spot Silver Suddenly Returns to Flat After Rising

From the early morning, it was reported that the American exchange rate showed a general stable and slightly soft underlying trend, and Hong Kong banks had strong buying interest. Coupled with a certain gold shop also tracking and purchasing on behalf of Xiamen banks, sellers raised prices and sold. At 9:50 AM, a certain silversmith (on behalf of Hong Kong banks) first purchased 50 taels each from fellow silversmiths and gold shops, all at 2,067 yuan, which was the opening price, three yuan higher than the previous close. After the opening, a certain gold shop purchased 100 taels from silversmiths at the same price as the morning opening. Subsequently, a spot silver shop also purchased 100 taels from silversmiths at the same price. Later, a certain silversmith purchased another 100 taels from gold shops, still at 67 yuan. Silversmiths then sold 50 taels to gold shops, also at 67 yuan. Afterwards, money exchanges mutually traded 50 taels, rising to 69 yuan. A certain silversmith then purchased 50 taels from fellow silversmiths, at the same price. Before long, a certain silversmith purchased another 100 taels from money exchanges, at 68 yuan and 67 yuan. Later, Yuhao sold 50 taels to silversmiths, also at 67 yuan, which was the noon close price. In the afternoon, due to buyers stopping their purchases and watching, and money exchanges continuing to dump, the situation turned sluggish. However, trading was extremely quiet, with only 50 taels seen sold by money exchanges to silversmiths at 2:30 PM, at a price of 64 yuan. There was no trading activity afterwards, so the evening close was still 2,064 yuan. As a result, there was no glory or disgrace compared to the previous night's close. The selling price of the spot silver shop's own-brand gold was 2,070 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,060 yuan. The spot silver standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no trading activity.

Jewelry Gold Changes to 210 Yuan

The selling price of silversmiths' jewelry gold per tael initially remained unchanged. But at 10:00 AM, due to the stable trend of spot silver under the purchase of customer banks, the price was raised by one yuan. Datonghang changed to 210 yuan, and Xintonghang changed to 208 yuan, with a purchase price of 202 yuan.

British Pound Weak, Pure Gold Rises Slightly

London, 11th telegram: British pure gold rose by half a penny (per ounce) due to the weakness of the British pound and more buyers, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6.5 pennies. The Central Bank's cash purchase price for Chinese was also 1,212 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed customs gold remained unchanged at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by 3 jiao, reaching 1,207 yuan and 9 jiao.

### Calm Exchange Market

Yesterday's exchange market saw active purchasing and settlements by Indian Commercial Bank Corporation and major foreign firms. However, foreign banks had good intentions for supplying British exchange. But the American exchange rate was selling less smoothly due to the weakening of the British-American exchange rate. Therefore, the situation was stable and slightly soft at one point. In the end, it relied on Hong Kong telegrams and Tianjin banks simultaneously selling, causing the situation to turn stable. As a result, there was still no glory or disgrace. Trading was still active. Hong Kong telegrams purchased British, Sai, and American currencies, with the calculated British-American exchange rate at 4 yuan, 6 jiao, 8 fen, and 0.1 hao. The Hong Kong exchange rate's underlying trend weakened as foreign banks' absorption strengthened.

In the early morning, the recent London big bills remained flat, while the long-term bills rose by 0.125. The New York silver price was stagnant as before. London raw gold rose by half a penny. The exchange rate of British to American was down by 0.6 hao, unchanged against Shanghai, and down by 4 centimes against France. American to British was down by 0.0625, unchanged against Shanghai, and up by 0.0625 against France. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The morning opening selling price of British exchange was 8 pence 25, and the American exchange rate was 16 yuan 0625, both flat compared to the previous night's close. After the opening, Hong Kong telegrams suddenly purchased British, Sai, and American currencies, with the calculated British-American exchange rate at 4 yuan, 6 jiao, 8 fen, and 0.1 hao. Foreign banks HSBC and MacCallum sold to Hong Kong telegrams (exchange arbitrage). The Indian Commercial Bank Corporation and foreign firms purchased British exchange at 8 pence 25, with little change in the situation. HSBC's listed exchange rates were announced as unchanged, and the silver balance tax was also announced as unchanged, still at a slight percentage of 0.00. Afterwards, foreign banks were less willing to sell American exchange, making settlements difficult for a time. But soon, Hong Kong telegrams and Dajin banks mutually dumped, so it returned to flat. Hong Kong telegrams (exchange arbitrage) and Yuli (on behalf of Tianjin banks) and the Netherlands sold American exchange at 16 yuan 0625 to the Indian Commercial Bank Corporation and foreign firms, so the situation was stable. Nearing noon, money exchanges sold Hong Kong exchange at 56 yuan 125 to foreign bank Andar, also flat. At the noon close, the bank selling price was 8 pence 25 for British exchange, 16 yuan 0625 for American exchange, and 56 yuan for Hong Kong exchange.

The afternoon trading turned quiet, with only foreign firms slightly settling accounts. Thus, the situation became more stable. Foreign firms settled with Jiufeng at 8 pence 25, while there was no activity heard for American exchange, and the price remained stable. Finally, Chinese banks mutually traded Hong Kong exchange at 56 yuan 125. At the evening close, the bank selling price was 8 pence 25 for British exchange, 16 yuan 0625 for American exchange, and 56 yuan for Hong Kong exchange. As a result, compared to the previous close, British and American exchange remained unchanged, while Hong Kong exchange tightened by 0.125.

### Korean Currency Weakest

Down 1 Jiao 2-3 Fen Compared to the Beginning of the Year

Yesterday, British pure gold rose by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate fell by 0.0625. Local foreign exchange saw strong demand from foreign firms, and various banks provided ample supply. The market price was stable as before. Spot silver opened firm, with Xiamen banks continuing to absorb, and gold shops and retail investors following suit, boosting morale and strengthening the momentum. However, money exchanges and silversmiths took advantage of the high prices to sell, gradually weakening the momentum. In the afternoon, money exchanges exerted their remaining strength, frequently selling. Xiamen banks stopped buying, retail demand was scarce, and rumors spread of a new British loan being established, softening the market price. Although there was significant volatility throughout the day, the result was still equal to zero, with little glory or disgrace compared to the previous night. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, continued to see the wealthy tend to emigrate, with less demand for British gold pounds. British and American gold notes saw strong demand from various foreign firms, and money exchanges provided ample supply. Trading was brisk. Hong Kong notes weakened again, with money exchanges selling diligently, which were absorbed by foreign banks. Korean currency was the weakest, having fallen within 9 jiao and 2 fen, down 1 jiao 2-3 fen compared to the beginning of the year, reflecting the weakness of their financial system. Association trading was extremely rare, with only Yongfeng and Changtai selling 100 silver shillings each, which were purchased by Tongyuan. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold pounds down 2 jiao, American gold pounds up 2 jiao, American gold notes up 3 fen, Hong Kong notes down 4 li, Philippine notes down 1 fen, and all other currencies unchanged.

### Tianjin Exchange Market Unchanged

Hong Kong Exchange Rises Slightly

Tianjin, 13th telegram: The exchange rates for British and American remittance were the same as the previous day. The market was stable. The morning opening market prices are listed below:

British Exchange 7 pence 90625

American Exchange 15 yuan 4375 Remittance Exchange 104 yuan (Remittance Exchange is the amount Tianjin should receive for every 100 yuan of remittance)

Hong Kong, 13th telegram: The exchange rates for British and American remittance were the same as the prices at 11:45 AM on the 12th (Wednesday). At 10:15 AM, Remittance Exchange rose by 3 jiao, 7 fen, and 5 li, with the price at 178 yuan 125.

### Discount Rate Turns Stable

Yesterday's exchange of promissory notes and discount rates had stopped falling and tended to stabilize, hovering around 48 yuan per thousand yuan throughout the day. The final price was still 48 yuan, the same as the previous day, it is said.

### Big Bills Flat, Long-Term Bills Long, Indian Silver Reverses from Fall to Rise

London, 12th telegram: The silver market saw Indian and speculative buyers purchasing long-term bills, with limited supply. The market was extremely tight.

### Securities: Government Bonds Type A Exclusively Good, Each Playing Their Own Game, Type B, D, C, E Mixed

The securities grey market remained firm yesterday, with the trend still shifting from weak to firm. This indicates that floating shares are gradually decreasing. The situation on the trading floor is still dominated by long positions, and short positions are unwilling to easily cover. However, the situation in Europe has eased, temporarily avoiding a split. The Sino-Japanese war is gradually showing more benefits than harm, and the public generally views it positively. Government bonds, especially Type A, are the most sought after because they have the smallest amount, the most draws, and the shortest term. Therefore, cunning investors feel that taking long positions in Type A is the most cost-effective. Investment and speculation are flocking to it. The market price was extremely stable after the opening, with Shuikang absorbing the most Type A bonds. Tianniu absorbed the most Type E bonds. Tianniu remains true to its original intention, selling Type B and buying Type D. Tongkanghao sells Type D and buys Type C, each with their own considerations. Shunheng, Yongfeng, and No. 11 sold more, and the market sentiment was flat. The market was firmer in the afternoon. Type A continued to advance, and Yuankang and No. 614 continued to buy as before. Retail investors also engaged in this type of trading, making the margin even scarcer. No. 38 bought Type C and sold Type E, because the former was cheap and the latter was expensive. No. 20 bought broadly. The market price resulted in mixed gains and losses, with only Type A rising by 0.25 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 700,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:

Stock Trading: 50 shares of the Bank of Communications were traded at a price of 12.50 yuan per share.

According to a report from the All Trades Association, the stock market was calm and firm. Currently, due to the uncertain situation, people are hesitant and cautious, waiting to see what happens after British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech is delivered before buying or selling. Shanghai Banking Corporation, Jardine Matheson, and Wheelock & Co. shares saw active trading. Tram and public bus shares still attracted buyers. Company bonds remained firm due to loose credit and those seeking to profit from it. Rubber shares showed slight activity, but prices were not strong.

London Chinese Foreign Currency Bonds on the 12th of this month (Wednesday) listed market prices saw only the Crisp Loan falling by half a pound, with a price of 36.5 pounds. The rest remained unchanged. The English supply of actual goods included 2,000 pounds (i.e., 10,000 American dollars) of Chinese-French-American 5% bonds with printed debt certificates, with a selling price of 66 pounds 5 shillings, one pound fifteen shillings above the market price.

London British Far East Companies' Stocks on the 12th of this month (Wednesday) listed market prices saw only HSBC Bank continuing to fall by two pounds, with the price for English registered shares at 80.5 pounds and the price for Hong Kong registered shares at 82.5 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.

### Merling & Marx Co., Dividend

The Shanghai-based American company, Merling & Marx Co., engaged in advertising, printing, and publishing, recently decided at a board meeting to hold this year's shareholders meeting on the 21st of this month and to pay an annual dividend of 3% for 1938.

### Cotton Yarn: Actual Sales and Speculators Both Active; Hope for Revival of 20-Count Yarn; However, Mill Offerings of Futures are Also Strong; Daily Consumption of Cotton Yarn is Huge, and Prices are Rising

The cotton yarn market remains calm and quiet, yet with an advancing momentum, mainly because demand in South China is showing signs of improvement. Consequently, the market has seen increased activity in 20-count Double Horse yarn, for which available supply is tightening. As for 10-count coarse yarn in North China, transactions are surprisingly robust, and there are signs of insatiable demand. In reality, goods are scarce, and spot traders are engaging in speculative hoarding, further propelling market progress. Prices for 32-count and 42-count single yarn and two-ply thread are exceptionally stable, largely due to weak mill production. Some also say that the price of 10-count coarse yarn has already risen by more than 20 yuan compared to the end of last year, while the price of 20-count yarn has fallen by 10 yuan. Currently, with actual demand in the South picking up, 20-count yarn should be able to make a step forward. If sales orders continue to come, it is possible to return to the 400 yuan mark. In the afternoon, due to favorable conditions, wealthy speculators resumed hoarding, further bolstering market sentiment.

Regarding the current yarn situation, at the start of the morning session, the market was still flat. As individual sellers made some sales, the asking price remained unchanged. 20-count Double Horse yarn was still trading at 392 yuan. Subsequently, due to active purchases of 20-count Double Horse and Heavenly Maiden yarn by the Hong Kong and Swatow merchants, prices gradually rose, and the market tightened. Some Yunnan merchants took profits and sold, causing slight weakness, but not enough to affect the market. By closing, prices had risen another step. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 394 yuan. In the afternoon, the market showed further strength, with Double Horse yarn rising again by 1.5 yuan, to 395.5 yuan. The price of Heavenly Maiden yarn reached 397 yuan. However, mills took advantage of the price increase to offer forward-month deliveries. As a result, various merchants bought a total of 2,890 bales. Prices for both 20-count Heavenly Maiden and Double Horse yarn rose by 2 to 3 yuan. Coarse yarn also rose by 2 to 3 yuan. Mill offerings were very substantial. Yong An Mill offered 1,500 bales of 20-count Special Golden City yarn for May delivery at a price of 395 yuan. De Feng Mill offered 100 bales of 16-count Variant Lion yarn at a price of 360 yuan. An Da Mill offered 200 bales of 20-count Flying Tiger yarn at a price of 388 yuan, and 100 bales of 10-count Flying Tiger yarn at a price of 305 yuan, for April-May delivery. Yong An Mill offered 50 bales of 10-count Special Ling City yarn at a price of 327 yuan. Xin He Mill offered 150 bales of 20-count Five Sons yarn at a price of 377 to 380 yuan. The total offering of these mills was 2,100 bales, with buyers paying a deposit of 40 yuan (cash) per bale. Today, 470 bales of exported cotton yarn were shipped to Swatow, 190 bales to Hong Kong, and 360 bales to Tianjin. The quantities purchased by various merchants are listed below:

The Japanese cotton yarn market also saw rising prices due to tight supply and the dominant long positions of large players, resulting in a strong market. In fact, consumption of this cotton yarn is high both in North China and in the guerrilla areas. The price of 20-count Water Moon yarn is above 360 yuan, and the price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 359 yuan.

### Mills Shifting Attention to Foreign Cotton; Domestic Cotton Prices Slightly Weaker; Issues with American Cotton Still Under Consideration

The domestic cotton business is as lonely as a morning star, with mills showing no intention to act. In fact, overseas cotton markets have been falling frequently recently, and translated prices are becoming increasingly cheaper. Therefore, mills are focusing on American cotton. There is concern that domestic cotton prices should fall, but with inventories already low and sources affected by a certain party's control, the situation is awkward. Yesterday, selling prices weakened slightly. Supplies from northern Jiangsu are also slow. Only 451 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the docks. The state of cotton unification is recorded on the left:

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market is particularly weak. Although there is still no resolution to the issue of loan cotton from Washington, various methods are being considered, with particular emphasis on export and subsidy issues. This is the only way to release the loan cotton. "In recent days, Bombay merchants have been the main sellers in New York. The general cotton market can now enter a provisional state." A slight recovery may be seen in the next two days, but in the future, further declines are still common. Yesterday, New York fell by more than ten pounds. India, including forecasts, fell by half a rupee. Egypt fell by twenty pounds. Exchange rates showed no significant change. Converted to legal tender, cotton prices all fell. American and Brazilian cotton each fell by 8 jiao per dan, Indian cotton fell by 2 jiao, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 1.6 yuan.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Transactions are gradually becoming more active, but there are still no large transactions. Recently, Sino-Japanese mills have been opening a lot of cotton yarn, slightly resisting raw cotton. Yesterday, a total of 300 bales of Indian cotton and 500 bales of Brazilian cotton were imported. Other mills had no transactions. The Japanese mills have been quiet for many days, because they have already allocated their cotton quotas. The futures price of foreign cotton yesterday, converted to the delivery price to the mill, is calculated as follows:

### Piece Goods: Spring Bargains Called For; Spring and Summer Cotton Goods Business Connected; Varied Spot Prices in East Piece Goods

Domestic Cloth

The market trend yesterday was stable, with both spot sales to local customers being good. Due to seasonal factors, the spring and summer goods business has come together, and retail sales in local shops are very prosperous under the call for large spring discounts from various cloth shops. Larger stores each have sales exceeding 10,000 yuan per day. Purchases from downstream ports along the Yangtze River such as Jingjiang and Wuhu are also strong. Demand from Jiangxi and Guangdong is also strengthening. More than 1,500 bolts of colored cloth, colored twill, bleached cloth, pongee, bleached twill, and fine cloth were purchased. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan purchased several thousand bolts of foreign yarn, colored cloth, yarn, pongee, and bleached cloth. Cantonese merchants purchased nearly 2,000 bolts of colored cloth and colored twill. Sales of bleached and dyed cloth were flat. Sales prices of white goods, fine cloth, and coarse twill turned stable, and transactions were less frequent. However, Jardine Matheson's coarse cloth was priced cheaply for spot goods in the market, and wholesale dealers and peers continued to purchase more than 300 pieces. Sixteen-pound Double Elephant and Five Blessings brands rose by one jiao per bolt.

East Cloth

Fine cloth and fine twill were still weak in the morning market, but firmed up in the afternoon. Asking prices for various brands varied, and large orders were also stable. However, the prices of those shorting the market were five to ten fen lower than spot prices. This is because those focused on speculative trading differ from those doing real goods transactions. Yesterday, spot goods of Leading Fine Twill required 12.65 yuan, while futures only sold for 12.55 yuan. Fine cloth had no major changes. Local dyeing shops continued to sell 600 bales, and market prices remained high. Because the distance was too far, no orders were placed.

Exports

Today, 180 pieces of piece goods were exported to Swatow, 190 pieces to Tianjin, 160 pieces to Yantai, and 500 cotton blankets were shipped to Haiphong.

### Secret Strife in the Woolen Industry Begins with "Add Three Inches on the Yardage"; Hope for Uniformity

The woolen fabric market is most prosperous in the Chessboard Street area. There are six shops specializing in Chinese clothing: Da Lun, Xian Chang, Sheng Da Xiang, Fu Kang, Hong Xiang, and Wan Cheng Yan. Recently, Hong Xiang took the lead in creating "add three inches on the yardage." On Sundays, they even added free shoe vamp material and wireless radio advertising, etc., which was opposed by the other businesses. The reasons were (1) businesses have regulations of adding one inch; (2) the current business is more prosperous than in previous years, so there is no need to over-accommodate, reducing profits. But according to Hong Xiang, Xie Da Xiang, Bao Da Xiang, Xin Da Xiang, etc. are all adding three inches. If the woolen fabric industry continues to be old-fashioned and does not compete, the business may be taken away by the foreign goods industry. Therefore, both sides held their own reasons, and the secret battle was very fierce. Although the Woolen Fabric Industry Guild held an executive meeting to discuss and sent private mediators some time ago, they were not successful. Therefore, in recent days, those who add three inches have risen, and it is feared that there will be further competition soon, but this is not a blessing for the industry. It is hoped that there will be uniformity.

### Food: Mill Flour Nominally Fixed, Actually Relaxed; Northern Merchants Continue to Order a Batch

Mill Flour

The market for mill flour yesterday continued to show a nominally fixed, actually relaxed trend. Sales to local customers were generally lively. However, customers preferred to buy flour in the market with current cash, which was not too expensive and had a whiter color than mill flour. It is said that the Northern Merchants recently shipped a lot. Seeing this situation, the mills had to make some concessions to please customers. It is said that yesterday the Northern Merchants ordered another batch of No. 2 flour at a price of 4.475 yuan and 4.45 yuan. Because the selling price in the North was lower, brands like Cannon Cart were harder, so the price was slightly different for Green Soldier Ship and Precious Star. The selling price of No. 3 and No. 4 miscellaneous brands of flour also had a difference of 5 to 10 fen. The market has not been unified. The wholesale price on the street is still 4.4 yuan original price, because the mills indicate that they are still stable, but in fact, they have softened invisibly. Exports of flour today are 31,500 bags, shipped to Swatow, and 7,000 bags shipped to Yantai, and 3,500 bags of bran are shipped to Swatow.

Foreign Flour

The market was also stable yesterday, and sellers were less willing to compromise than in the previous two days, because recent sales to local customers have been quite lively. Most of the newly arrived goods have already been allocated. Except for medium-grade and miscellaneous brands that are being sold off cheaply, old brands such as Red Sun and that Day, and other popular brands that have strong sales to customers are sticking to their prices. It is said that yesterday there were new transactions of 20,000 to 30,000 bags with local customers. The domestic price is quite relaxed. The foreign price still requires US$2.545, and it is difficult to divide it up after fees, so orders from foreign firms continue to be quiet.

### Domestic Wheat Stable; Japanese Merchants Continue to Inquire

Supplies of wheat have been arriving in small amounts for several days, all shipped to Shanghai from the Yangtze River area, but the amount is still not large. Each factory's intake is because they have foreign wheat orders and domestic wheat shipped from the production area, they do not care about the odd supply in the market. However, a certain Japanese flour mill, etc., because there is no foreign wheat ordered, secretly bought it. It was heard that more than 300 bags of wheat from Jiangbei were opened yesterday, with prices ranging from 7.13 yuan to 7.1 yuan, similar to the previous board, and were all purchased by Japanese merchants. However, according to the seller, the wheat was still purchased by the customer gangs. It was investigated that 350 bags of wheat were shipped from the new port yesterday.

### Customer Xian Arriving in Endless Streams; Du Rice Depreciates to Sell

Customer xian has been arriving, and after the Qingming Festival, it has remained in a weak state. In the past few days, river boats have continued to arrive with whole batches, and grain merchants, Japanese merchants, and powder have set up shops to transport and sell them. In the future, the source of Anhui rice will continue to come in an endless stream. Yesterday, the line hoarders and customers were all stagnant, and only the original street picked up 1,000 bags of price goods, and the market price was immediately reduced by 1.5 to 2 jiao.

The sources of Tu rice for each gang, the lower reaches only arrive at the second and third number, the train wheel sentence, the Su Tong gang nearly 2,000 bags, the Kunshan gang and other 400-500 bags, to the sales ground, although there are sellers who have dropped prices to sell off, and the retail route is more sluggish than before, so all the goods are rarely made open, such as the thickness of the geng market has fallen by 1-2 jiao, Tu Yang Jian Bu Jian also fell by 1 jiao, Bian Yuan although the goods are scarce, but the route is slow, so the market is also tired.

### Silk and Tea: The Overseas Silk Market Rises Again; Japanese Silk Rises Thirty-Five Yuan; The Shanghai Market Also Suffers Severe Stimulation

Overseas silk markets: Yesterday, Yokohama spot prices rose by 35 yuan, and forward prices rose by 38 yuan. The spot price can be expected to directly knock on the 1100 yuan mark. New York silk at 83.75 points each rose by four points, and Shanghai silk still sold at the original price (according to New York silk prices rising by 1.1 yuan in the past three days, Shanghai silk is still sold at the original price). Lyon Japanese silk rose by 4.5 francs and Shanghai silk A grade remains unchanged (according to the rise in Japanese silk prices by 6.5 francs in Lyons over the past two days), 2B grade rose by one franc, Guangdong silk remains unchanged. In short, in recent days, the supply and demand relationship in the main raw silk sales market has been very tense. For example, in the past two weeks, New York raw silk has shown signs of being "tight," which is a reflection of this relationship. At the same time, this spring's production of raw silk in China and Japan is expected to decline further, so Yokohama and New York forward prices also rose yesterday. In addition, international situation is becoming more and more urgent, and the domestic war of resistance is almost reaching a stage of full-scale counter-offensive. All these factors have made the people in the East market sway, and whether the current Japanese cabinet can maintain the precarious situation and whether the Japanese yen is about to be officially devalued, etc., may promote a rapid rise in silk prices.

Domestic silk market: Yesterday, upon receiving news of price increases from Japan and the US, they were regarded as unexpected and deeply agitated. People's hearts have become more firm, but there are still doubts. It seems that although the foreign firm silk market rose by about 20 yuan yesterday, manufacturers generally held a wait-and-see attitude, so transactions were not prosperous. Yesterday, only Jardine Matheson and other firms entered eight-five uniform degrees 20-22 silk mark 50 dan, seventy-eight uniform degrees 40 dan, the market price slightly fluctuated due to the previous day's telegram and the current day's current conversations.

### Sugar Market: Production Prices Increase; Coarse White is Tight

The sugar market trend tightened yesterday. Foreign sugar prices from the Netherlands are reporting price increases, causing the Shanghai market to increase. The spot price for 24 coarse sand white sugar is 25.3 yuan, and transit goods are 17.1 yuan, with 300 bags traded. Taikoo Sugar, Puxi goods are 25.35 yuan, with sporadic transactions. Chao sugar opened with more than 50 bags of ordinary upper ice sugar, priced at 23.5 yuan, Chongtiqing with more than 50 bags priced at 14.95 yuan, and Tianjin Diaoqing is said to have off-market transactions.

### Hardware: Flat Lead Silk Market is Uniquely Outstanding

The transaction of flat lead silk has been exceptionally active recently, so the city trend is unique in the mediocre steel market. The market price is strong because the new goods cannot keep up and the inventory is also dry, so its market form is exceptionally strong. For example, 2 points is estimated at 34.5 yuan per market dan, 2.5 points at 25 yuan, 3 points at 23.75 yuan, 3.5 points at 22.5 yuan, 4 points at 22 yuan. It was investigated that a total of 400-500 dan were opened in yesterday's market, mostly purchased by the factory and the Tianjin and Yantai gangs. As for the industry's separate purchases, there are very few.

### This Factory Yuan Nail

Actual Sales Launched

The factory's yuan nails have been actively purchased and transacted by customers, construction gangs, and local industries, and the transactions are extremely considerable. On the previous day, a total of 1,500-1,600 buckets were opened, which were opened by the iron industry on North Suzhou Road, and the market price was 17 yuan per bucket of Bessie. For example, one inch is 2.7 yuan per bucket, 1.25 inches is 2.2 yuan per bucket, 1.5 inches is 1.5 yuan, 2 inches is 1 yuan, 1.5 inches is 7 jiao, 3 inches is 6 jiao, 3 plus half inches is 6 jiao, 4 inches is 5 jiao, 5 inches is 2-3 jiao, 5.5 inches and 6 inches is 3 jiao, 7 inches is 1.5 yuan, 4.5 inches are not added and other small patterns such as 4 points sell for 26 yuan, 5 points sell for 31 yuan, and 6 points sell for 26 yuan, plus taxes, which are purchased in large quantities by the Tianjin gang, and other architectural interests and local industries are also slightly embellished.

### Medicinal Materials: Galangal Fruits - Supply Cannot Meet Demand

Galangal fruits are produced in Guangzhou and Hainan Island. Since the two regions have been occupied successively, transportation is difficult, and the supply has been cut off for a long time, so the selling price has been raised to 45 yuan one after another. Recently, all the gangs have been actively procuring, and there is a shortage of supply. For example, the transaction price was 50 yuan per dan, and if there is no arrival, it seems that it needs to continue to rise.

### Import and Export: Fresh Eggs Arrive - 1,300 Pieces

Yesterday, 3,520 pieces of local paper were shipped from Wenzhou, 105 pieces of tobacco leaves, 950 pieces of fresh eggs came from Wenzhou, 290 pieces came from Xingang, and 50 pieces came from Qidong.

### Wusong: Japanese Soldiers Surrender with Weapons; Guerrilla Forces in the Area Will Accept Them; Surrendering Japanese Soldiers are All Young Soldiers

Two Japanese soldiers stationed in Wusong suddenly surrendered to the guerrilla forces in the area with weapons last night (the 12th), and were accepted. When asked why they surrendered to the guerrilla forces, they said that they could not bear the oppression of the warlords who forced them to fight against China, and that they would become ghosts in a foreign land in this life, with no hope of returning to their country. Even their life in Shanghai was such that they could not get three meals a day on time. They also said that the number of casualties in the Japanese army since the outbreak of the July 7th Incident has exceeded one million. The two Japanese soldiers are all young.

Annihilation of Japanese Soldiers in Guanyintang Town: Guanyintang Town, which belongs to Qingpu County between Xujing and Huangdu, has hundreds of town residents. Recently, fearing that guerrillas were hiding there, the Japanese stationed more than ten Japanese soldiers. At about 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, while the Japanese soldiers were having breakfast, they were surrounded and attacked by the local guerrilla forces. The Japanese soldiers were caught off guard, and all ten soldiers were annihilated. Two machine guns, more than ten rifles, and many bullets were seized on the spot. When the Japanese soldiers in Huangdu Qingpu City heard about it, they joined forces and dispatched hundreds of Japanese soldiers to rush to the scene. The guerrilla forces had already left.

Sharp Increase in Wounded Japanese Soldiers Transported to Shanghai: Recently, a large number of wounded Japanese soldiers have been transported to Shanghai in the Yangtze River and are being accumulated in various military hospitals. Because there are not enough Japanese transport ships to be dispatched, it is still difficult to transfer all of them back to Japan at once. Yesterday morning, two batches had already returned to Japan across the sea. The first batch, numbering more than 4,000 people, was exported from Shanghai by the Japanese merchant Huangwan at 9:00 a.m. and transported six truckloads of corpses, about 3,000 boxes, each box containing one corpse. Outside the wooden box, there was another layer of white cloth. The second batch of more than 2,000 wounded soldiers boarded the Rui Sui Maru at the Osaka Wharf of the Japanese merchant in Pudong and set off for Japan at 11:00 a.m. It was also heard that more than 10,000 wounded soldiers were still gathered in the temporary military stations of the Shanghai Shupu Yong An Yarn Factory and the Liaoyang Road Yapu Ear Bulb Factory, waiting for transport ships to transport them back to China. This shows that after the Sino-Japanese War entered the second stage, the situation changed and the number of soldiers who died or were wounded on the battlefield increased sharply compared to the first stage.

Japanese Warship Destroyed and Sent to Shanghai for Repairs: At about 3:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, a Japanese destroyer was towed into the Huangpu River and entered the South Huangpu River Shipbuilding Plant for repairs. The warship was bombed in the Yangtze River by the Chinese Air Force, and the stern was hit and seriously injured. The deck was severely damaged. When it passed the Bund of the 16th Concession, it stopped at the Duchen Road crossing for a moment.

### The American Advisory Committee Allocates Large Sums for Relief: Approximately 100,000 Yuan Issued Weekly; Legitimate Requests are All Approved

The Continental Daily News reported: Yesterday (the second day above), it was learned that the American Advisory Committee had allocated approximately 194,000 yuan last week to conduct relief projects in various departments of "free" and "occupied" China. Starting with the allocation of 50,000 yuan to relieve Huaiyuan District, Anhui, the largest single allocation was the 100,000 yuan allocated to the West China Cooperative Committee. Zhenjiang in Jiangsu Province and Puzhou (phonetic translation) in Anhui Province each received 10,000 yuan. Yancheng in Henan Province, Qingjiangpu in Jiangsu Province, and Yancheng each received 5,000 yuan. Xixing (phonetic translation) in Zhejiang Province was also allocated 4,000 yuan. As of the end of last year, the committee had allocated approximately 3,249,000 yuan. Since January 1 of this year, the committee has been spending approximately 100,000 yuan per week to provide relief. According to a member of the committee who spoke to reporters, the committee has been responding to all legitimate requests for relief funds to date.

### Ningbo's Current Situation is Peaceful; Resumption of Shipping is Still Early: The Situation is Relaxed, Resumption is Not Difficult

Since the implementation of the blockade of Zhenhai Port on the 5th of this month, any ships have been strictly prohibited from entering. However, the current situation in Ningbo is extremely peaceful. There have been no Japanese aircraft entering the country for reconnaissance this month, and business is still thriving. However, commodity prices have generally increased, and there is sufficient food in storage, so there is no fear of a shortage in three months. However, no one has yet made a request for the resumption of Shanghai-Ningbo shipping, so it will be difficult to do so in the short term. However, it is believed that after the Zhejiang Bureau gradually relaxes, the authorities will promulgate shipping measures that take both transportation and defense into consideration, so that travelers can travel conveniently and freight can be transported smoothly.

### The Commander of the US Asian Fleet Schedules to Visit Hankou on His Flagship: US Naval Authorities Claim This Trip Has No Importance, But It is Generally Believed to Be for Inspecting the Current Situation on the Yangtze River

(News from this city) The US Naval Authorities in Shanghai claim that the Commander of the US Asian Fleet, Yan Luer, is scheduled to travel to Hankou via Nanjing on the flagship "Isabel" on the 15th, taking six days en route, for a total journey of 21 days. He will arrive in Hankou on the 26th and return to Shanghai. The official purpose of Yan Luer's trip has not been announced, but it is generally believed that the authorities are inspecting the situation on the Yangtze River, similar to Yan's previous inspection of the Yangtze River with the US Consul General in Shanghai. In addition, the US warship "Guam" also plans to sail to Hankou on the same day to rotate with the "Oahu." The "Oahu" will escort the "Isabel" back to Shanghai along the way. The US Naval Authorities emphatically stated that Yan Luer's trip has no political significance.

### The Japanese Requested the Municipal Council to Ban Anti-Japanese Newspapers, Using the Spirit of Understanding as a Pretext; No Mention Was Made of Anti-Foreign Propaganda in the Japanese Newspapers

The Continental Press reported that the Japanese Consul General Miura requested the General Director of the Public Works Bureau, Fan Keling, yesterday (the 12th) to take action against anti-Japanese magazines and newspapers published in the Public Concession. A spokesman for the Japanese Embassy stated last night when receiving reporters from various newspapers that the request was made in accordance with the spirit of understanding recently obtained by the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities. However, when asked if there were newspapers in Japan that published anti-foreign propaganda, the spokesman replied that it was "another question." When a reporter asked whether Fan Keling had raised the issue of anti-foreign content in Japanese newspapers during his meeting with Miura, the spokesman replied in the negative, adding that the Japanese side had not mentioned the names of any specific newspapers. The request made to Fan concerned general anti-Japanese newspapers, the important ones being Chinese-language newspapers. When a reporter asked the spokesman whether the phrase "the main ones are Chinese-language newspapers" meant that any English-language newspapers had been mentioned, the spokesman replied that, as previously stated, it concerned general newspapers. According to the spokesman's statements, "after occupying Shanghai for more than a year," the Public Concession still publishes certain publications, such as newspapers and magazines, that engage in anti-Japanese propaganda. These publications are guided by agencies acting on behalf of the Chongqing government to promote resistance against Japan. After holding a meeting to discuss the matter, especially as it affected the maintenance of peace and order in the Public Concession, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, visited the Director General of the Public Works Bureau, Fan Keling, and presented a memorandum containing the request to control anti-Japanese newspapers in Shanghai in order to comply with the spirit of understanding recently obtained by the Municipal Council and the Japanese authorities. According to Miura, Fan Keling said that he was well aware of the Japanese authorities' views and agreed to take the necessary measures to control the publications. Fan Keling told reporters last night that he had received a memorandum from Miura yesterday afternoon, but according to Fan, he had not made a statement to the Japanese Consul General and had never damaged the reputation of the Municipal Council.

### Foreign Vessels Reduced in Number Due to Japanese Control of Shipping on the Yangtze River: If This Continues, They Will Likely Be Completely Seized

Since the Japanese side controlled the shipping in the ports of the Yangtze River up and down (a few ports in North Jiangsu are still in the hands of the Chinese army), the Japanese Qing Company sent vessels to run, because they were within the scope of special violence, and the goods in and out of each industry were forcibly loaded and transported by Japanese vessels, resulting in the original foreign vessels of the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, etc. operating in each port. , the business plummeted and the number of flights was reduced successively. According to the shipowners who spoke to the Modern News reporter, since Japanese vessels started operating and competing in various ports along the river, foreign vessels have been subject to all kinds of harsh restrictions by the Japanese military authorities, and the cargo freight has been light, with many vessels reducing flights and suspending flights. If this continues, it is feared that in two or three months, they will be completely seized by the Japanese side.

### Number of Unemployed in Shanghai Exceeds 300,000

Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, according to statistics, more than 800,000 people have taken refuge in the concessions from Jiangwan and Zhabei, resulting in unemployment. Recently, some have managed to operate small-scale crafts and raise funds to resume factories on their own. However, as of now, the number of unemployed people in Shanghai is about 300,000.

### Sea Defense and Yangon Freight Transportation Increases Sharply: Shanghai Adopts a Allocation System for Loading and Transportation

Since the fall of Guangzhou, our country's import and export goods have been diverted to Myanmar, Yangon, and Vietnam through defense. Today, the transportation of goods in the above-mentioned areas has increased sharply. It is heard that British merchants Taikoo and Jardine Matheson have decided to increase the number of merchant ships in response to requests from various customs declaration firms. Regarding Shanghai, due to the small number of direct flights and the large number of special cargo shipments, the various shipping companies and customs declaration firms have negotiated to adopt a allocation system for loading and transportation.

### Ministry of Economy Bans Re-branded National Goods; Enforcement Agencies to Conduct Strict Investigations

The Ministry of Economy, in response to the re-branding of Japanese goods for sale in various locations, has sent telegrams to the governments of Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces, instructing them to conduct strict investigations and bans according to the law. The telegram states: "We have recently received a document from the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee, forwarded by the Executive Committee of Guangxi Province, stating that a large number of enemy goods are entering through Wenzhou and being transported to Hunan, Jiangxi, Guizhou, and Guangxi, where they are being re-branded and sold as domestic goods. They request that a strict investigation and ban be ordered." The Ministry has investigated and determined that enemy goods disguised as national goods or goods from other countries should be investigated and banned by local authorities and customs checkpoints according to the regulations for banning enemy goods. There are also explicit penalties for merchants who re-brand, transport, and sell enemy goods. The Ministry should announce and specify the names and trademarks of enemy goods, but the names and trademarks of re-branded enemy goods change frequently. If local enforcement agencies discover such re-branded enemy goods and, after investigation, confirm that they are enemy goods but the names and trademarks have not yet been announced by the Ministry, they should first handle the matter according to the regulations and then report to the Ministry for verification. Therefore, in addition to sending telegrams to order the ban, we are also sending a telegram to your provincial government, requesting that you instruct the local authorities to strictly enforce the ban according to the law and report the progress of the investigation at any time.

(Signed) Weng Wenhao, Minister of Economy (Stamped)

### Smooth Postal and Remittance Services Between Shanghai and Ningbo; Obstacles to Remittances Between Shanghai and Dinghai

Postal and remittance services between Shanghai and Ningbo remain smooth, and remittance fees have not changed. However, the time required is inevitably longer than usual because it is necessary to transit through Wenzhou. Although the post office has not suspended remittance letters between Shanghai and Dinghai, in practice, after the interruption of shipping between Shanghai-Dinghai and Ningbo-Dinghai, even if the letters arrive...

### Portuguese Ships Detained Despite Protests; "Fulu" Also Detained; Shipping Companies Request Permission to Unload Cargo First; Portuguese Ships Suspend Operations Until Dispute is Resolved

After Japanese warships detained nine Portuguese merchant ships, despite protests from the Portuguese Consul-General, there has been no news of their release. Yesterday, the Portuguese ship "Fulu" of the Zhengde Company arrived in Shanghai from Beisha and was also detained by the Japanese. Passengers have been released. The detained shipping companies have requested permission to unload cargo first. Details are as follows:

Companies Request Permission to Unload First: The nine Portuguese merchant ships "Meida," "Tanglu," "Tangbei," "Tangqiao," "Hailong," "Libao," "Bide," "Baode," and "Dade" are anchored at Yangshupu buoys under the supervision of Japanese warships. Each ship has one Japanese soldier stationed on board, ostensibly for protection but actually for surveillance. Although passengers have been completely released, the cargo has not yet been unloaded. Because cargo owners are eager to take delivery, shipping companies have requested the Portuguese Consul-General to negotiate with the Japanese to allow the unloading of cargo.

Still Not Released After Protests: Despite protests by Portuguese Consul-General Alves to Japanese Consul-General Miura, there was no news of their release yesterday. The Portuguese ships previously detained by the Japanese have also not been returned. These include "Vila Real," "Coimbra," "Timo," and "Mairia." It is said that "Coimbra" has been renamed "Haimen Maru," and "Mairia" has been renamed "Nantong Maru." "Vila Real" is managed by the Japanese company Nisshin, while "Timo" remains detained in Taiwan.

"Fulu" Detained, Passengers Released: The Portuguese ship "Fulu" of the Zhengde Company, represented by Datong Heji, operates on the Beisha route. Yesterday, at 2:30 PM, it arrived in Shanghai from Haimen. It intended to dock at the Bund wharf on Wuma Road, but when passing Yangshupu, it was signaled by a Japanese warship to stop and was detained. It is now anchored at buoys number two and three on the Huangpu River. Approximately one hundred passengers who arrived in Shanghai from Haimen requested permission from the shipowner, and last night, a Japanese warship sent a small boat to transport them to the Xinguanshi wharf to disembark. However, the cargo and crew remain on board.

Portuguese Ships Suspend Operations Until Dispute is Resolved: Portuguese shipping companies have decided to temporarily suspend all Portuguese shipping operations until the detained Portuguese ship incident is resolved. The Portuguese ships currently anchored in Shanghai and Wenzhou include "Tangsai," "Meida," "Xinde," "Damao," "Fade," "Wanguo," and "Shantai," either docked at wharves or anchored at buoys. The losses for Portuguese merchants are substantial. As for the Portuguese ship "Deyao," represented by the Italian company Yihua, it sailed as usual from Shanghai to Beisha yesterday.

Preparing to Charter Ships to Send Dinghai Passengers: Because the "Lishi" ship on the Ningbo-Dinghai route was detained in Shanghai, more than 240 passengers from Dinghai were stranded. The Dinghai Association and Zhengde Company planned to charter ships to send them back to their hometown. Zhengde Company has chartered the German ship "Gaoden" from the German company Lulin. However, according to reporters from the Xinsheng News Agency, the Dinghai County Magistrate, because Dinghai is a prohibited port, has requested instructions from the Ningbo Defense Commander and General Liu of the Second Army Group regarding the plan to charter ships to send the stranded passengers back to Dinghai.

Detained Mail Already Returned: The Portuguese ships "Meida" and "Hailong" were carrying mail, either from Shanghai to Wenzhou or from Wenzhou to Shanghai. After negotiations with the Japanese authorities by the postal authorities, permission has been granted to return the mail first. It is reported that the post office has sent personnel to return the mail. The mail from Shanghai to Wenzhou has been transported to Wenzhou by other ships. Yesterday, the foreign ships sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou were the Italian ship "Binli" of the Italian company Yihua and the German ship "Feikang" of the German company Lulin. As for the German ship "Deping" of the Italian company Zhongyi and the German ship "Haifu" of the German company Lihe, they are scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou tomorrow.

### Increased Guard at Huge Building on Haig Road; People Inside Still Not Going Out; Tenant Gone to Macau and Not Returned

The Continental Daily reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, upon hearing that the Chinese residence at 448 Haig Road was to be converted into a casino, requested the Police Department to erect barbed wire barricades in front of the house on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The patrolmen directing the work were still guarding the barricades yesterday (the 12th). About twenty Chinese workers and several Taiwanese people are still surrounded inside the house. It is said that they have stored at least a week's worth of food inside. The house was formerly occupied by the Li Guojie family. The current tenant is a Taiwanese person who has gone to Macau and not returned. The patrolmen have notified the people inside that they are allowed to leave the house at any time, but as of last night, they had not left the house. The Police Department has never erected barricades at the entrances of any casino outside the concession before. It is said that this action was taken at the request of the Municipal Council after notifying the Japanese authorities. The Municipal Council's decisive and unprecedented action is due to the location of the house, which is adjacent to Hong'en Hospital to the north and near several schools.

### Rumor that Xiong Jiandong is Still Detained by Japanese Military Police; Several Wounds on Forehead; But Attitude Remains Calm

Xiong Jiandong, the guerrilla commander of the six counties of Cen (Changshu), Jia (Ding), Tai (Cang), Kun (Shan), Qing (Pu), and Song (Jiang), came to Shanghai last month for official business and was arrested by the Japanese. After being taken to Hongkou, various sectors were very concerned about his fate. It was rumored that after being arrested by the Japanese, Xiong refused to become a traitor and be scorned by the Chinese people, which angered the Japanese and led to his execution. However, this has not been confirmed. According to investigations by reporters from the Xiandai News Agency and inquiries among Xiong's confidants, Xiong is currently detained in a special room in the Hongkou Japanese Military Police Headquarters. His relatives and friends have tried to arrange a meeting with Xiong, but because the Japanese guards are closely monitoring him, they could not talk. They could only communicate briefly through eye contact. Xiong has several wounds on his forehead, and his face is thinner than before, but his attitude is calm, as if this sacrifice has brought him supreme glory.

### Xi Shitai Murder Case; Bystander Killed by Bullet; Japanese Newspapers Claim He Was the Murderer; Police Department Still Investigating

News Agency: Xi Shitai, a native of Dongting Mountain, Wuxian County, and secretary of the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau," was shot and killed in front of the entrance of No. 6 Juyi Lane, Lloyd Road, at 9:15 AM on the 11th of this month. At the time, a bystander, Peng Fulin (23 years old), a native of Liyang, was also hit in the chest by a stray bullet. Peng immediately went to Shilong Hospital for treatment, but died in the hospital around 2:00 AM yesterday due to his injuries. The body has been sent to the mortuary for examination. At the same time, all Japanese newspapers in Shanghai carried reports yesterday claiming that Peng was one of the murderers of Xi. There were as many as five other people who went with him to assassinate Xi, and a mastermind named Yuan Dechang was directing from the side. Yuan is a key figure in the Pudong Guerrilla Force. Peng's younger brother, Jin Xia, Peng's friend Zhao Zhixiang, and another person surnamed Chen, who accompanied Peng to the hospital, were all participants in the murder of Xi, etc. This statement has not yet been confirmed.

The North-China Daily News reports: "We learned yesterday (the 12th) that detectives investigating the assassination of Xi Shitai on Tuesday morning have determined that the two people currently in custody are indeed related to the assassination. One of them, Peng Fulin, was seriously injured by a bullet in the abdomen and is currently being treated at Baolong Hospital. His condition is very critical, and the detectives have been unable to interrogate him. The other person was accompanying Peng to Baolong Hospital on Tuesday morning and was arrested in the hospital. The police have learned that the two were near the scene of the shooting on Lloyd Road. Peng was injured and did not seek help, but took a rickshaw to Baolong Hospital. The hospital doctor notified the police that a person with gunshot wounds had been admitted, which aroused suspicion. The detectives took the injured man's friend to the Laozha Police Station for interrogation. According to his statement, the police believe that the two are related to the shooting.

Although no specific information was given to the press yesterday, reporters learned that the injured man did hear gunshots injure a Chinese policeman. When the Chinese policeman was chasing the fleeing terrorists, he fired his gun and also injured one of them. No weapons were found on either suspect, so it is believed that at least one other person is involved in the case. At the same time, the police's ballistics experts are carefully examining the bullets removed from Xi's body and have discovered that this

weapon used

has no previous record in the history of the city's police. The city is currently conducting a city-wide search for other members of the terrorist group that planned the case. Peng is being guarded by police officers in the hospital to prevent anyone from communicating with him. As a result of the shooting on Tuesday, a spokesman for the Japanese military in China has criticized the Municipal Council for not following the Japanese proposals to prevent further violence in the Public Concession and stated that the work of the Municipal Council Police Department still has certain

shortcomings.

It can be seen that the two suspects were taken into police custody about twenty minutes after the shooting occurred. Also, the Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury reported that Peng Fulin died of his injuries at Shilong Hospital this morning (the 13th)."

### Safety Campaign; Five Meetings Held; Promotion Week to Begin Next Month

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, due to the sharp increase in the city's population and the frequent occurrence of traffic accidents, has established a Safety Campaign Committee to discuss measures to reduce accidents. The committee is scheduled to hold its fifth committee meeting at the American Club at 4:30 PM today. At that time, public bus, tram, taxi, and foreign merchant automobile companies will present proposals for promoting road safety for joint discussion. After other group meetings, the official Promotion Week will begin next month.

### Father Jacquinot Strictly Investigating Corruption in Refugee Area; Currently 20,000 Refugees in Area; Monthly Expenses and Supplies Sufficient

Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Nanshi refugee area was established when the National Army withdrew from Shanghai and has lasted for one year and four months. When it was first established, the situation in the suburbs of Shanghai was chaotic, and many residents of Nanshi did not have time to evacuate into the concessions. Father Jacquinot and other enthusiastic individuals, acting on humanitarian principles, appealed and established a safe refugee area in the Kunming joint concession. At one time, more than 100,000 people gathered to be rescued. Since then, the number has gradually decreased, and as of recently, there are still about 20,000 people. The method of providing supplies is to distribute rice once a day in each area. Each refugee receives a tin can of rice weighing about six ounces. The supply and administrative expenses are 20,000 yuan allocated monthly by the Relief Committee and about 30,000 to 40,000 yuan monthly from charity lotteries, which is still sufficient. However, recently, staff members of the office, such as Wu Yanxiu, have taken advantage of their positions to embezzle food supplies and engage in other corrupt practices. When Father Jacquinot learned of this, he was very angry. In addition to revoking the passes of these staff members, he has also dismissed them from their positions. These staff members are trying to incite unrest, but because the refugees are unwilling to be exploited, no incidents are likely to occur. Father Jacquinot has been inspecting the area for several days and has decided to conduct a thorough investigation to deter others. Currently, the situation in the area is still very good.

### Fish and Pork Industries Jointly Swear Oath; Yesterday Issued Declaration Stating Position; Resolve Not to Participate in Any Illegal Organizations; Absolutely Will Not Succumb to Coercion by Powerful Forces

The entire fresh pork industry in Shanghai jointly issued a declaration yesterday, stating: "Our industry's pork companies have been operating in Nanshi, Wusong, Yangjing, and other places. Since the August 13th Incident in 1937, we have moved into the concessions. Our sole purpose is to facilitate the flow of goods and maintain the people's food supply. Since February 1939, we have been levying a small amount of tax to provide relief to refugees on a monthly basis, consistently following the right path to fulfill our national duty. However, recently, some have attempted to divide our industry's unity through inducement and coercion and distort our industry's solemn position in order to achieve their seductive goals. Such absurd behavior that disregards the greater good and seeks only self-interest has long been deeply hated by all industries in our country. Therefore, we specifically declare that the jointly named companies in our industry swear to uphold justice, resolve not to participate in any illegal organizations, and absolutely will not succumb to coercion by any powerful forces. This will remain unchanged until the seas run dry and the rocks crumble. We have all agreed and jointly sworn this oath, never to be negligent. The original and duplicate copies of the oath have been entrusted to designated personnel for safekeeping. Fearing that the outside world may not understand the truth, we are jointly issuing this declaration again to strengthen our line of defense and correct perceptions. We trust in the public's judgment."

### Rumor that Puppet "Municipal Government" Will Be Reorganized Again; Fu Xiao'an Dismissed and Transferred; Gao Guanwu to Succeed as Puppet

According to sources within the puppet government, there will be a partial reorganization within the puppet "Municipal Government" at the end of this month. The puppet position of puppet "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an is rumored to be in jeopardy again, and Gao Guanwu, the puppet "Mayor" of Nanjing, will succeed him in his post. The reason for the change is still the dissatisfaction of the Japanese special agencies with Fu. In February, Fu's rice bowl was originally supposed to be broken, with puppet "Secretary-General" Su Xiwu being promoted to replace him. Later, because Fu's activities in Ningbo were successful, Liang Hongzhi relayed the matter to the Japanese, using the pretext that the puppet "diplomacy" was in a period of tension and that the puppet "Mayor" should not be changed to avoid external influences. This proposal was temporarily shelved. Currently, Fu and Gao are in Tokyo, flattering the Japanese. However, disputes within the puppet "Municipal Government" have been frequent, and even middle and lower-level officials have been divided into Fu and Su factions, with severe infighting. To eliminate hidden dangers, the old matter is being brought up again, Fu will be dismissed and transferred, and to preserve Fu's face, Su Xiwu will not be promoted to replace him. Therefore, there is a proposal to transfer Gao Guanwu to succeed him. It is also said that the puppet "government" and "two puppet bureaus" will also be reorganized.

### Japanese Ship on Huangpu River Causes Accident; "Jiangsu Maru" Severely Damaged; Blue Funnel Ship's Stern Injured

The "Jiangsu Maru" ferry of the Japanese Shanghai Ferry Company's Takahashi Line, which returned to Shanghai from Gaoqian the day before yesterday afternoon, carried a batch of last-train passengers at the Gaoqiao ferry terminal. At around 5:30 PM in the evening, when passing near the Japanese transport ship "Kitaura Maru" moored at buoy number three on the Lujiazui Pudong surface, a Blue Funnel Line ship from the Swire Shipping Company was coming from upstream. The "Jiangsu Maru," which was between the ship and the "Kitaura Maru," was moving too fast and could not avoid the collision. The bow of the "Jiangsu Maru" violently collided with the stern of the "Kitaura Maru." The iron bars and iron frames in the first-class cabin were completely destroyed, and the damage was severe. The "Kitaura Maru" suffered no damage because the hull of the warship was sturdy. When the accident occurred, the "Jiangsu Maru" was shaken violently, and its stern also damaged the stern of the Blue Funnel Line ship. Iron girders broke off and fell onto the deck of the "Jiangsu Maru." Fortunately, no one was injured. It is reported that the damage to the "Jiangsu Maru" itself is estimated to be 2,000 yuan.

### Three Tenants Intimidate Second Landlord, Madam Pan, Who Falls to Her Death; Exploiting Her Daughter's Weakness, They Scheme to Usurp the Property; Police Investigate and Prosecute, Each Tenant Sentenced to Three Months Imprisonment

Madam Pan, residing at No. 75, Alley 230, Xiamen Road, was originally the second landlord of the premises. During the August 13th Shanghai Battle, she took her daughter, Yan Sheng, to seek refuge elsewhere, entrusting the management of the house to her third tenant, Ningbo native Madam Cao Zhang, etc. After the war subsided in Shanghai, Madam Pan and her daughter returned to their former residence, but Madam Cao Zhang and the others had no intention of relinquishing control. As Madam Pan accumulated a substantial amount of unpaid rent, the primary landlord filed a lawsuit in court. After the two parties reached a settlement, Cao Zhang, colluding with the other three tenants, Wang Shangda and Zhu Yinzhang, encouraged Madam Pan to transfer the lease of the house to Zhang Yanqing, a Ningbo native, claiming that this would not only settle the rent debt but also leave her with surplus funds. However, Madam Pan, due to the meager transfer fee offered by the other party and the harsh conditions, was unwilling to agree. Unexpectedly, these individuals, exploiting the woman's weakness, resorted to threats and enticements. In mid-last month, it was suddenly discovered that all the documents related to the house had been stolen. Madam Cao Zhang and her group of men and women intensified their efforts, adding intimidation, threatening to make Madam Pan's head and body separate and throw them into the Huangpu River. Having lost all evidence of her status as the second landlord, and hearing such terrifying words daily, the woman went to Mr. Sun, a colleague of Zhang Yanqing in Tongchang Lane, Hainan Road, on the 23rd of last month, seeking assistance. Sun and his wife, Madam Shen, tried to comfort her, urging her not to fear these threats. However, the woman could not bear such provocation and committed suicide by jumping from the building at home that night, falling to her death. After the incident, the Laozha Police Station, upon receiving the report, sent detectives to investigate the cause of the woman's death. Believing that Madam Cao Zhang, Zhang Yanqing, Wang Shangda, and Zhu Yinzhang, four individuals (men and women) were unquestionably guilty, they were arrested and prosecuted for the crime of restricting freedom. After repeated interrogations by the First Special District Court and continued investigation by the police, Judge Zhong Qing opened a court session yesterday morning, ordering the four accused to be brought up for review. The deceased's thirty-eight-year-old daughter, Pan Yansheng, separately retained a lawyer to appear in court and file a civil lawsuit against the defendants, seeking compensation for losses. After her mother's death, the orphaned woman, without any support, is temporarily staying with the Sun family. The Sun and his wife specially testified to prove that Madam Pan had come to their home before her suicide, recounting the threats made by the defendants. The court then questioned the defendants and the lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the police station and the defendant's lawyer concluded their arguments. Judge Zhong then sentenced Madam Cao Zhang, Zhang Yanqing, Wang Shangda, and Zhu Yinzhang to three months imprisonment each. If they chose to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it would be calculated at one yuan per day. The attached civil lawsuit was transferred to the civil court for review.

### The Japanese Army Indiscriminately Arrests Innocent People in Xujiahui and Other Areas

Recently, the Japanese military police team on Lincoln Road, West Shanghai, has been sending Japanese soldiers disguised as workers to arrest people everywhere. Yesterday morning, six or seven disguised Japanese soldiers arrested farmers Tian Baogen (resident of Yuangenglang, Zhongxin Jing West), Zhang Xiaodi (resident of Nanjiazhai, Hongqiao Road), Huang Jinrong (son of the shoeshine "Xiutang", resident of Xujiazhai, west of the ball court), and Yu Heshang (resident of Yujia Oil Mill, south of Hongqiao Town), suspecting them of being guerrillas. They were sent to the Japanese military headquarters on Lincoln Road for interrogation. However, because Yu had a pair of handcuffs on him, he was tied to the railway crossing on Hongqiao Road and executed by Japanese soldiers yesterday afternoon. The other three are still being detained. Also, after the manager of the Taishan Brick and Tile Company, "Little Ocean", (the company was founded by Chinese merchants but seized by the Japanese) was killed by guerrillas in a certain place a few days ago, Mori, the head of the propaganda unit of the Japanese army stationed in Beiqiao Town, Humin Road, learned of this and sent Japanese soldiers from Minhang to search Tan's residence behind Heda Temple. Villagers Gu Jinmao, Shen Aqiu, and Shen Akun were arrested. Later, Jin Atian, who ran a teahouse in Huajing Town, was also arrested and sent to the Minhang Japanese military headquarters for interrogation. The day before yesterday (11th), more than 30 Japanese soldiers, led by a traitor, went to the Xiaohong residence south of Tangwan Town and tied up and arrested Hong Guanping and Li Xuesheng, villagers residing in Bo Gouqiao.

### Japanese Military Police Open Fire and Arrest Chinese People Outside of Avenue Bugeaud; Concession Authorities Have Not Received Formal Notification; Japanese Side Believes There Are a Large Number of "Rioters" in West Shanghai

The North-China Daily News reported that shortly before 7 a.m. yesterday (12th), a team of Japanese military police opened fire on a group of Chinese people who looked suspicious in the "Avenue" area outside of Avenue Bugeaud, arresting 11 people and seizing two handguns. Both sides exchanged gunfire at the time, but as of late last night, it was still not known whether anyone was injured. This area has always been a hideout for "rioters." It is unknown whether the Japanese military police were conducting a search, resulting in an exchange of fire, or whether these Chinese people were all guerrillas planning to take action near gambling dens and opium dens in the western district. The Public Concession Police Authority replied yesterday that they had not received formal notification of the arrests and seizure of handguns, nor were they sent to the scene, as it was not under their jurisdiction. The number of Japanese military police involved in the shooting could not be confirmed last night, but it was believed to be around 50. It was heard that the number of Chinese people was about the same. It was the first time in recent months that the Japanese military police had been able to capture "rioters". According to reliable sources last night, the Japanese military police were ordered to conduct a search in the area because the Japanese side believed that a large number of "rioters" resided there. The Japanese military police may also be investigating the guerrillas who have been active near the Public Concession in recent months, but it is believed that if they are indeed irregular troops, they are all equipped with rifles.

### First Prize of the Eighth Charity Lottery Awaits Claim; Second and Third Prizes Have Been Claimed

The first prize of the eighth charity lottery for the relief of refugees issued by the French Concession, number 31607, was sold by the Dagong Enterprise Company store at the general sales office on Nanjing Road on March 11. According to the message from the French head office, apart from the second and third prizes, which have all been claimed, the first prize of 44,750 yuan has not yet been claimed. We now hope that the winner of the first prize will quickly go to the French head office (No. 1, Rue du Consulat) or the general sales company to redeem the full amount. There will be absolutely no donations or deductions, and the procedure is extremely simple. In addition, the ninth lottery was issued less than a week ago, and the number of tickets sold has reached one-third, so the sales of this lottery are expected to exceed the previous one.

### Beitang Road Church to Hold Concert; Famous Artists to Participate in Performance

### Renfeng Factory Employees Accuse Manager and Others of Embezzling Tens of Thousands in Bonuses; Zhu Gengtao and Others Fail to Appear in Court, Hearing Postponed

Cao Xingbin and 77 other employees of the Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory in this city recently jointly filed a complaint with the Second Special Court, accusing the factory owner, Xie Keming, the factory director, Xu Yanyu, and the manager, Zhu Gengtao, of embezzling 41,345.87 yuan in bonuses. Zhu Chuzhe, a judge, summoned them to the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning. The defendants, Zhu Gengtao and others, did not appear. Chen Minkui, as a representative of the plaintiffs, arrived in court with a lawyer. He first stated that the wages of the plaintiffs who worked at the Renfeng Factory were extremely low, ranging from two to ten yuan, a mere sum that was obviously not enough to support a family. What they hoped for was the year-end bonus, which could be used to supplement their income. For example, in 1936, the factory had a surplus of 650,000 yuan, which the defendant side had clearly admitted. According to precedent, the bonus was distributed, but the amount of the bonus due to the plaintiffs was embezzled by the defendants jointly, amounting to a huge sum of 41,345.87 yuan. Therefore, they requested that the defendants be punished with the deserved crime, and ordered to return the full amount of the embezzled bonus. After reviewing the complaint, the court learned that the defendants had not arrived, so it announced that the hearing would be postponed to April 27, when the defendants would be summoned to court for further trial.

### Chinese Police Officer Killed in Foch Road Shooting Last Night; Police Investigate Car and Criminals

Zong Zhenmin, a Chinese police officer from the Foch Police Station (i.e., Baojian Road), No. 340, was 26 years old and from Zongming. He had been in this position for only one month, having been assigned to the 6:30 pm to 12:30 am shift on the night of the 12th, patrolling the section between No. 913 Foch Road and the intersection of Route Commandant Rebeaud. At 10:30 pm, a black sedan-style car with a white license plate (number unknown) drove from west to east on Foch Road and stopped in front of No. 1009 on the British Concession side. A man, about 20 years old, got out of the car and went to the French Concession side to look for the house number. Police Officer No. 340 Zong saw him and, suspecting his appearance, went forward to question him. Unexpectedly, the man reached out and punched Police Officer Zong in the face twice. At this time, two other men got out of the car. One of them asked what was going on and then fired a shot with a handgun, hitting Police Officer Zong in the buttocks. The officer fell to the ground, wounded. The three men who committed the crime ran to the car and sped away eastward. Although Police Officer Zong was wounded and fell to the ground, he was still conscious and blew his whistle. Police Officer No. 1117 arrived, learned what had happened, and reported it to the police station. An ambulance was called and Police Officer No. 340 Zong was sent to Guangci Hospital. After the doctor's incision and treatment proved ineffective, he died at 3 pm yesterday. The hospital notified the police station, and the body was taken to the autopsy room at No. 302 Rue Testelin to await inspection by a representative from the Second Special Court. The police station sent detectives to investigate various car dealerships and to track down the fugitive criminals for legal action.

### Country Girl Escapes Hell; Abducted and Taken to Tianjin to Be Sold into Prostitution; Two Criminals Arrested on Ship

The Chinese Women and Children Relief Association dispatches investigators to accompany detectives from the Water Patrol Police to board ships exporting to the North and South Seas, to search for abducted boys, girls, and women when the ships are exported from this city. This has been quite effective over the years. At 11 am on the 11th of this month, Chen Shaoting, an investigator from the association, found Yao Xiaoqin, a 19-year-old woman from Changshu, traveling to Tianjin alone in the third-class cabin of the Shengjing, a Tianjin-Mekong ship at Taikoo Wharf No. 3. Upon questioning, it was learned that she had been abducted and handed over to the ship's tea boy to be taken to Tianjin. The woman was detained, and the tea boy who handled the consignment was ordered to hand over Chen Peifang, a 20-year-old woman from Tongzhou (resident of No. 113, Shiyin Lane, Rue Kerloc'h), and was sent to the French Police Station. According to Chen Peifang, the woman, Yao, spent 260 yuan to buy her to a man named Bing Sheng, and was entrusted to someone to take her to Tianjin to work as a prostitute. Yesterday, the police station sent Chen Peifang to the Second Special Court for interrogation. A woman came to the court to listen. Yao pointed out that she was also involved in the abduction and sale, so the woman was turned over to the bailiff and taken to the police station to be detained for investigation. Chen Peifang was interrogated by Judge Miao Qingbang in the First Criminal Court at 3 pm. The lawyer from the French Concession Administration requested a postponement for investigation before filing a suit for interrogation. After the court questioned the defendant, it announced that the hearing would be postponed to the 22nd and the defendant would be detained.

### Foreman Commits Suicide Due to Economic Hardship

Zhang Cailang, a 27-year-old man from Chongming, lived in a straw house with no number near Balidu Road, Xujiahui, in the French Concession. He used to work as a foreman, contracting small projects in various construction projects. Therefore, he had dozens of workers under him. In the past, if there was work, the food for all the workers was subcontracted to a caterer, calculated by name, and paid by him on their behalf, and then collected from the workers. Unexpectedly, in recent years, due to the impact of the war, work has plummeted. The workers, seeing that the foreman had lost his ability to operate, scattered and sought their own way. However, those who owed food money in the past had not settled their debts. Although Zhang Cailang had already paid some on their behalf, there was still a huge amount owed. They were all waiting for the workers to get work and gradually deduct it. Now that they have all scattered, the debt owed to the caterer will inevitably fall on Zhang Cailang alone. The caterer, due to a lack of capital turnover, demanded payment every day. Zhang, however, was ill-clad and had no ability to repay the debt. He could not cope with it, and a rift arose between them. Recently, the other party's demands have become more urgent. Zhang, in a state of poverty and desperation, suddenly had suicidal thoughts and swallowed poison pills last night. Fortunately, his family noticed and rushed him to the Dongsong Hospital for treatment. However, because the poisoning was too deep, his condition was critical.

### Tao Gongchen's Father Dies After Being Hit by Car; Funeral Scheduled

Tao Gongchen's father, the head of the General Affairs Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration, went out from Wanshi Lane, Sanxing Lane, Connaught Road, at 5:45 pm on the 11th. Unexpectedly, as soon as he left the lane, he was hit by a speeding motorcycle and fell to the ground, suffering serious injuries. Street police officer No. 3251 arrived upon hearing the sound and sent him to the First Refugee Hospital on North Tibet Road for emergency treatment. However, due to his old age and weakness, the rescue was unsuccessful, and he died at 1 am yesterday. It is said that Tao's father was 76 years old and had always been in good health. Now that he has suffered such misfortune, those who heard about it all felt sorry for him. Gongchen, in view of the current national crisis, did not send out obituaries and scheduled the funeral.

### Rong Sheng Company Gambling Den Bodyguards and Others Armed Robbery, Kidnapping, and Extortion; Robbery of Two Police Detectives and the Huge Sum of Liang Weiming's Family, and the Kidnapping and Extortion of Zhang Zhirui's Son Hanren; Five Major Thieves Who Repeatedly Committed Major Cases Await Sentencing After Trial

Xie Zhiguang, the head of the Chinese detectives from the Route D'iesves Police Station, and Detective Zhao Lianbi, arrested six bandits Xu Yongquan (i.e., Yougen), Wang Yushan (i.e., Wen Haiquan, Xiao Shandong), Zhu Yunlong, Shen Yougen, Chen Haibin (i.e., Xiao Changdong), and Jiang Xianghong (i.e., Fuke) at No. 2, Lane 684, Yu Garden Road and Route Haig on February 19. Four pistols and Mauser guns, 32 bullets, and a lot of stolen goods were confiscated. After investigation, it was learned that these people, together with Li A'er (i.e., Garbage Can A'er), who is still at large, invaded the homes of Chinese Detective Yao Jiaqi and Chinese Deputy Detective Pan Ximan at No. 239 Da Xi Road on February 26, and robbed Liang Weiming's family at No. 7, Lane 156, Yidingpan Road, of property worth 3,582.7 yuan. On March 11, they invaded Zhang Zhirui's home at No. 29, Lane 189, Zha'na Road, West Shanghai, and took Zhang's three-year-old son Hanren, obtaining 7,000 yuan for his release. They were sent to the First Special Court.

The case was under detention and interrogation. At 2:30 pm yesterday, Xiao Peishen, the presiding judge, specially tried the case in the Second Criminal Court, and designated lawyer Qian Yuzhong as the pro bono defense attorney. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, first stated the facts of the Yao and Pan two detectives' home robbery case, saying that the defendant Wang Yushan was working as a bodyguard at Shao Lian'geng's gambling table at the Rongsheng Company on Rue Ratard in West Shanghai. The Mauser gun was decided to be used for robbery, but there was no purpose at first. While wandering on the way, at No. 339 Da Xi Road, they happened to see a maid pushing the door open, so the defendants rushed in. Yao, the police detective, lived downstairs, and Pan, the deputy police detective, lived upstairs. They were robbed of two pistols and clothes and money. They took the stolen goods and split them in room 308 of the Nanjing Hotel on Shanxi Road under the name of Li Hongsheng. Li Yuan is now pawning a coat in Yunnan Zhonghengsheng. At Chen Guiting's French General Association, No. 47 Avenue Edward VII, they stole 100 yuan. Deputy Chinese Detective Pan Ximan reported that he was serving at the Hongqiao Police Station. On the evening of February 26, there was a thief who suddenly broke into my bedroom. I was robbed of a pistol and many other items, and pointed out that except for Zhu Yunlong, the rest of the defendants were watching. Chinese Detective Yao Jiaqi also testified. When questioned, the defendants all admitted it. Only Chen Haibin denied it. Then the lawyer stated that in the second case, except for the defendant Jiang Xianghong, the other defendants robbed Liang Weiming's family at No. 7, Lane 156, Yiding Road, of more than 3,000 yuan on February 17. Afterwards, they split the stolen goods in room 207 of the Xin Hotel on Jiujiang Road, and each got 200 yuan. When the defendants were arrested, a cigarette case engraved with Liang Weiming's English characters was found next to Xu Yongquan, and a gold cigarette case robbed from Liang's house was found next to Wang Yushan. Stolen goods were also pawned at Yunnan Road Hengmao Pawnshop, Avenue Edward VII Tongsheng Pawnshop, and Foch Road Tongchang Antique Shop. The Tongsheng Pawnshop took in a gold watch worth more than 300 yuan for more than 90 yuan, which is suspected of receiving stolen goods. The police station will file a separate lawsuit. Then the victim, Mrs. Liang Junying, and the witness, the maid Shen Abao, reported the case, proving the robbery and identifying the five defendants Xu, Wang, Zhu, Shen, and Chen as robbers at the scene. The stolen goods retrieved by the police station have also been confirmed to be correct. Xiao questioned the defendants based on the facts, and they all admitted the robbery. The lawyer then stated the second kidnapping case, saying that except for Jiang Xianghong, the rest of the defendants colluded with Li A'er, who is still at large, and invaded Zhang Zhirui's home at No. 39, Lane 189, Rue Knape on March 11, robbing him of 400-500 yuan in clothes and more than 300 yuan in cash. They were still not satisfied, so they opened the drawer and saw a savings passbook for 20,000 yuan from the Bank of Communications, so they demanded 10,000 yuan from Zhang. Because it was Saturday, the thieves also knew that even if they found the passbook, they would not be able to withdraw the money, so they asked for cash. At that time, a maid came in carrying Zhang's three-year-old son Hanren, and the thieves kidnapped Hanren as collateral. On Monday, the 13th, the thieves contacted Zhang by phone and agreed to negotiate the ransom in room 404 of the Continental Hotel on Rue Amiral Courbet. Zhang then withdrew money from the bank and drove to room 404 of the Continental Hotel. Suddenly, the thieves led Zhang to room 322 of the Far Eastern Hotel opposite. As a result, Zhang paid 7,000 yuan to redeem his son. At that time, Zhang, because many things were robbed, asked the thieves to return the pawn tickets, and the thieves also agreed. Zhang did not report to the police station afterwards. When the defendants were arrested, they confessed to this case, saying that all the phone calls were made from the Far Eastern. Police detectives also investigated this point, and there was a phone call from room 322 of the Far Eastern to No. 20537 on Taiyang Island, which is Zhang's phone number. The telephone bill was presented as evidence. Zhang Zhirui reported the case, stating the details, which was the same as what the lawyer said, but Zhang pointed out that the five defendants Xu and others were all present at the time to kidnap, rob, and negotiate. The defendant Chen Haibin still gave evasive testimony when questioned, and the rest admitted it. After the police station's lawyer and the lawyer Qian Yuzhong, who was designated to defend the defendants, debated, the court concluded the trial and awaited sentencing. The defendants were returned to custody. The police station has learned that the defendants also committed robberies at Li Juren's home at No. 13, Yangzi Village, Yidingpan Road, for 3,000 yuan, Zhou Bogui's home at No. 16 of the same lane, for 700 yuan, and Cao Zanyan's home at No. 24, Caojia Zhai, for 1,000 yuan. Because the location belongs to the road built beyond the border, the police station did not prosecute.

National Medicine and Dietetics

### Talking About Milk (Part 1)

— Ding Jimin

It seems that it has become a trend in society now, no matter who wants to take supplements, they always say that they want to have some milk, chicken essence, and beef essence every day. People with poor nutrition, when they go to the doctor, are always advised to eat some milk, chicken essence, and beef essence. Western doctors certainly say this, and Chinese doctors have recently become no exception. In particular, milk has occupied a very important position in dietary supplements.

The nutritional value of milk is very clearly recorded in the Compendium of Materia Medica in traditional Chinese medicine. The current excerpts are as follows:

Milk (Taste) sweet, slightly cold, non-toxic (Indications) tonifies deficiency and emaciation, quenches thirst. (Other Records) nourishes the heart and lungs, relieves heat and toxins, moisturizes the skin. (Ri Hua) Cold tonic, lowers heat, cook with garlic and boil for food, removes cold rheumatism. (Zang Qi) People with hot wind should eat it. (Meng Xian) It is beneficial for the elderly to cook it, and adding ginger and green onions stops children from vomiting milk and tonifies consumption. (Si Miao) Treats vomiting and hiccups due to heat, tonifies labor and damage, moistens the large intestine, treats dysentery due to qi, removes jaundice, and is very suitable for the elderly to cook porridge. (Shi Zhen)

The nutritional components published by Western doctors are as follows:

Milk Moisture 87.2, Protein 3.5, Fat 3.7, Carbohydrates 4.9, Ash 0.7, Vitamins A, B, and C are all present.

Looking at the above interpretations of Chinese and Western doctors, milk is indeed a good thing, so no wonder Chinese and Western doctors both recommend it to patients. However, according to my experience, some patients do see very effective results after eating it, but some patients remain the same, and even a small number of patients vomit after eating it for the first time (mostly old ladies), some have bad breath after eating it, and some have diarrhea. Many patients have said to me: Milk is too hot in nature. Is milk hot in nature after all? This is a question that most people want to ask, so I don’t mind writing some of it below:

### Hunger and Fullness

— Wei Jingqing

Eating enough leads to fullness; eating not enough leads to hunger. This is known by everyone. But what does it mean to be hungry while full, and full while hungry? Humans eat to nourish themselves. The poor say they eat because they are forced to by hunger, while the rich say they eat for the enjoyment of good food. However, from a medical point of view, the purpose of eating is to replenish the nutrients that the human body needs for life, and there is no distinction between rich and poor in this. But if the digestive function is not healthy and cannot secrete essence to nourish the blood, then even if one eats a lot of delicious food, it will still not benefit the body's nutrition. At the same time, waste cannot be excreted from the body. Food may stagnate in the stomach and intestines, causing abdominal distension and constipation, and turbid qi to rise. The human body will not benefit but will be harmed. On the other hand, even if one eats less, if digestion is normal, the essence will be enough to replenish the body's nutritional needs, and waste can be excreted from the body in time. In this case, the purpose of eating is achieved. This is more beneficial than eating a lot of delicacies but having poor digestion, which is beneficial. This is what I mean by being hungry while full and full while hungry. In the former case, although one eats a lot, one lacks nutrition, hence the term "full but hungry." In the latter case, although one eats less, one has sufficient nutrition, hence the term "hungry but full."

The feeling of hunger and fullness is also a natural ability that helps us maintain normal digestion. The reason why we feel hunger is because the stomach is empty, and the reason why we feel fullness is because the stomach is full (exceptions due to illness are a different matter). Therefore, we should eat when we are hungry and not eat when we are full, so that the digestive function of the stomach can always be maintained normally. The only people who starve are those who are forced to by economic constraints. I have never heard of a gourmet who, seeing a delicious meal, has his appetite aroused, but forcibly restrains himself because he is worried that he cannot digest it. Therefore, diseases caused by overeating are common. Shouldn't those who pay attention to dietary hygiene always follow the guidance of this natural ability to protect their health?

There is a saying, "If you want a child to be safe, always keep him three parts hungry and cold." In fact, adults should also "rather be slightly hungry than overeat," so that they are hungry but full, and avoid the situation of being full but actually hungry.

### Shellfish Foods

— Jiang Jianchu

Shellfish foods, in the minds of Chinese people, have always been regarded as dishes to accompany meals and drinks, and considered to have no nutritional value. This is a mistake. Although shellfish foods are cheaper than fish and meat, a careful examination of their nutritional composition reveals that they are actually more nutritious. In European, American, and Japanese countries, they are highly valued. Their juices are often extracted and made into medicines specifically for treating pulmonary tuberculosis and developmental deficiencies. In various parts of Guangdong in our country, they are also used to treat tuberculosis.

The shellfish we commonly see include shrimp, crabs, clams, snails, oysters, etc. The nutritional value of the first four is relatively lower, while oysters are the best.

Oysters are also known as oyster yellow. The Cantonese call them "hao," and their oil is called "oyster sauce." Oysters have a salty taste and a slightly cold nature. Eating the meat inside the shell can replenish deficiency, stop sweating, treat malaria, and eliminate fright, and nourish the body and dispel heat. They can also treat blood leakage and seminal emission. Their most notable effect is that they are good at treating phlegm accumulation and chronic coughs and asthma in the elderly. They can also nourish the lungs, so they are suitable foods for those who are weak after illness.

One point to note: the meat of this food is not easily digested. Therefore, those with poor digestion should not eat too much. When cooking, it should be simmered over low heat for a long time to be beneficial.

### Dizziness

— Zou Demin

Dizziness is a liver disease. It refers to a condition where the head and eyes are dizzy and unsteady, the body is out of control, and one feels that the house is spinning and the ground is moving, leading to falls and fainting. Mild cases resolve on their own in a short time, while severe cases may take several days to recover. There are many causes of the disease, but the most common is blood deficiency and rising liver fire. It is more common in women than in men, and more common in the elderly than in young people. It is most common in spring. Even those with a history of dizziness are prone to relapse during this time of rising yang energy.

When the disease occurs, it is advisable to take medicine to regulate it. If the method is appropriate, one or two doses can cure it. If you want to cure it thoroughly, you must pay attention to self-care, broaden your mind, be happy, and choose what you like to do. Spicy and stimulating foods are strictly prohibited. In addition to taking medicine, you can use mulberry leaves (stir-fried until withered) and black sesame seeds (stir-fried until cooked), grind them into powder, add sugar, and eat them as a snack when half-hungry. They taste very fragrant and delicious, and have the functions of dispelling wind, cooling blood, soothing the liver, and benefiting the kidneys. According to experience, it has a special effect on dizziness caused by blood deficiency and liver hyperactivity. This is to incorporate medicinal food into daily diet. Regular consumption will surely have great effect. The prescription of Fushang Pill in ancient times is also the same. (Chrysanthemum tea is also slightly effective, eat walnuts often, do not worry too much, and do not live in a house with too low a roof.)

### Roasted Sweet Potato

— Ye Jinqiu

If a pair of thoroughly modern young men and women were holding roasted sweet potatoes and eating them in their seats in a high-class cinema, then it can be predicted that they would definitely attract the attention of those sitting next to them. If a few roasted sweet potatoes were placed on a banquet table for guests, then it can be predicted that the host would definitely be criticized for being stingy. However, that would be wrong! Roasted sweet potatoes are both fragrant and sweet; they are palatable and filling; the four words "cheap and good" can be applied to them without shame. It is not a silly girl who cannot be dressed up. As long as you peel off its rough outer clothes, its delicate and white skin will touch people's eyes and immediately arouse infinite pleasure. Westernized, spread some butter on it, or rustic, add some cooked lard, and while it is still hot, send it to your mouth bite by bite. Even if you are not hungry, your mouth will water. Moreover, it also contains sufficient nutritional value and medicinal effects. However, if there were a great doctor who prescribed a few sweet potatoes as a medicinal primer on a formal prescription, it can be predicted that this doctor would inevitably be ridiculed as being improper. Why is it subjected to such embarrassing discrimination? Probably the first reason is that it is sold too cheaply, and the second is that its appearance is too ugly. In fact, its effect is really not small! "Diagnosis Collection" says, "There is a case of long-term spleen diarrhea, which was ineffective after taking medicine. Later, a doctor passed on a prescription: Take a sweet potato, half a catty, mix it with yellow mud, wrap it up, put it in the stove and bake it until cooked, remove the mud and skin and eat it. Do this with each one, and after eating for three or four months, the spleen qi will be healthy, and the stool will also be firm." (Omitted below) This shows its effect.

Tofu and green vegetables are the most hygienic. (Recorded words of President Sun)
— Hu Zhenxiang

Small Records of Dietary Nourishment

### Malt Extract and Tofu for Coughs

— Fan Jingfu

Buy a small amount of maltose (i.e., malt extract, commonly known as pure sugar) from an old goods stall, stew it with tofu, and feed it to children suffering from coughs in spring. It is very effective, but at the same time, it is necessary to avoid eating foods such as fish and shrimp that can aggravate the condition, so that it is easy to achieve results.

### Good Medicine for Venereal Disease

— Wang Jieren

Syphilis is a malignant venereal disease. Patients often seek help from 606, but Smilax glabra (i.e., mountain turtle) in Chinese medicine is also an important product for expelling syphilis. Smilax glabra is a blood-changing medicine for deterioration. It has the effects of clearing blood and detoxifying. It can treat ulcers, sores, and syphilis that have not healed for a long time. However, it is effective only when eaten in large quantities. If it is eaten in the early stage, it is more effective than arsenic, iodine, bismuth, mercury, and other agents for all stages of syphilis.

### Sweet Potato Stops Seasickness

— Ding Lixiu

Sweet potato, also known as sweet potato, and also known as yam. It is sweet and warm in nature. Frying and eating it replenishes the spleen and stomach, benefits qi and strength, resists wind and cold, and improves complexion. The scales vary. Those with red skin, no tendons, and a pure sweet taste are good. It can also be eaten raw. Those who are seasick when crossing the sea, whether raw or cooked, will be at ease after eating a small amount.

### Dietary Therapy for Leukorrhea

— Lu Hengqing

Women's physiques are generally not as strong as men's, and their physiological organization is also more complex. Therefore, most of them are thin and sick. Moreover, women's psychology is particularly sensitive to shame. If they encounter leukorrhea that is continuous and unclean, they often endure it in silence and avoid mentioning it to doctors, resulting in improper medication and self-delay, which is a great regret. For dietary treatment, every morning after washing, take seven ginkgo biloba seeds with the hearts removed and three walnut kernels, put them in your mouth and chew them carefully, then swallow them with boiled water. If you do not stop, it will surely have miraculous effects over time.

### Eating Bran Cakes for Athlete's Foot

— Qin Shufan

Those who suffer from athlete's foot can take equal amounts of bran and flour, add some lard (about two tablespoons of oil in a rice bowl), white sugar or salt, and a few eggs (two eggs in a rice bowl) and a little cold boiled water, stir them together into a paste, put them in an iron pot and bake them into thin cakes, and use them as breakfast or afternoon snacks on a daily basis. It will be effective over time.

### New Recipes for Health-Preserving Foods (II)

— Ni Xian

(IV) Winter Melon Tea (Preparation) Take one tael of high-quality Fujian rock sugar and one and a half taels of raw watermelon seeds (do not remove the shells, as half of the efficacy is in the shells). Boil with water until the sugar dissolves and the seeds are cooked. Take the soup and drink it frequently. (It is even better if it can be stewed in a large rice pot.) The sweetness can be adjusted with water. (Effect) This tea is sweet and refreshing, and although it seems plain, it has a great effect. It can be taken daily for dry coughs with blood and prolonged illnesses. It can moisten the lungs, relieve coughs, stop bleeding, and reduce fever. It has been repeatedly tested.

(V) Laver Soup (Preparation) Purchase some plump laver from a South Goods Store, pick out impurities such as sand, hard roots, small fish, and shellfish, then rinse it with boiling water. It can be stewed on the rice pot or steamed in water. Since laver is a type of seaweed, it is originally salty, so there is no need to add other seasonings. (Effect) It is good for treating pulmonary tuberculosis. Even if it is half rotten, it can be restored. Laver has the functions of dissolving hardness, unblocking collaterals, removing turbidity, and eliminating phlegm. It is better than Bletilla striata. Someone suffered from severe pulmonary paralysis, spitting out foul phlegm, and all medicines were ineffective. Later, he moved to the seaside and ate laver every day, and he recovered.

(VI) Lard Dates (Preparation) Take plate lard, peel off the skin, cut it into small cubes, pickle it with white sugar, then take good-quality jujubes, use a small knife to dig out the pits, put a piece of lard in each date, put them in a bowl, seal the top with cotton paper, pierce small holes like lotus seed pods, steam them on the rice pot two or three times, open the seal and look at them. The dates are plump, the skin is flat, and the oil is melting and dripping, like crystal color. Then they can be taken. (Effect) They taste sweet, fragrant, and fatty. They are specifically for replenishing the spleen and stomach, filling the middle qi, increasing appetite, and moisturizing the skin. People with stomach diseases who are hungry after eating should eat two or three each time, which is very beneficial.

(VII) Kanli Decoction (Preparation) Peel five or seven longan pulp (commonly known as dried longan), and one mace of American ginseng (it must be more than seven hundred branches, whole or sliced). Decoction with plenty of water and take it on an empty stomach or before going to bed. (Effect) These two things can nourish the heart and help the true fire, and can clear heat and lengthen the body fluid. All symptoms such as yin deficiency, hyperactivity of fire, thirst, palpitations, insomnia, irritability, dry mouth, and constipation can be gradually relieved.

### Guerrilla Warfare in Shanxi

— Mao Lie

This season, we can often see the excitement of guerrilla warfare in Shanxi in the newspapers, because telegrams about it are often issued from Chongqing, Yuanqu, Xingji, and even Beijing. However, these telegrams are always short and only state the general situation, making it impossible for us to see the full picture. Therefore, it can be said that there are some shortcomings.

Now, there is a detailed special telegram sent by a Reuters correspondent from a certain place in Shanxi. This really gave us great joy and great comfort! We are delighted to learn of this news, and comforted that the guerrilla warfare in that area has been so successful!

So far, we have seen several such telegrams. In summary, there are the following key points that deserve our attention:

(1) The cities occupied by the Japanese army are useless. Not only can they not be used as bases to wreak havoc, but they have become urns for catching turtles, making them helpless. They have suffered several losses, so they dare not attack them again. Guerrilla warfare has indeed had a great effect. I think if all parts of the country can do this, how difficult will it be to eliminate the enemy!

(2) The military supplies made by our army have such wonderful uses and are so sufficient that even if the international route is really cut off in the future and external assistance cannot arrive, there is nothing to worry about. It can be seen that the heavens never cut off all avenues. Everything depends on human effort. As long as there is a need and you are willing to work hard to find a way, it can always be solved.

(3) The people in all those places have been fully mobilized and have become one with other anti-Japanese warriors. This is also something that other places cannot match. We have long known that this war of resistance is a national war of resistance, but the implementation in other places is always somewhat lacking, not as complete and thorough as in these places. We should learn from this.

(4) The Japanese are of course doing everything they can to sabotage, and the correspondent believes that the worrying thing is the disruption of Japanese currency and goods, which may cause difficulties. I hope that the authorities in that area will be able to pay close attention, on the one hand, to prevent them from using their skills, and on the other hand, to meet the legitimate needs of the people.

Most of these points give us comfort. In the last point, I think that under the wise authorities, difficulties will always be easily overcome.

In this second phase of the War of Resistance, guerrilla warfare is still the main position, so I specially brought up the guerrilla warfare in Shanxi to ask our compatriots across the country to pay attention; at the same time, I also hope that our journalists will have such detailed telegrams sent to us, further increasing our joy and comfort.

### Mother and Son

— Tianshe

Just after putting down the rice bowl, the mother and son of the Pockmarked Ma family are arguing again in the small house.

"Damn it, really damn it!" Uncle Shupao knocked on his early tobacco pipe, stretched out his twig-like hand, wiped off the rice soup stained on his whiskers, and said with a wrinkled mouth: "In this situation, what are they still arguing about? They can't even get food in their mouths, but they have the leisure to argue. Alas, alas!" He was sighing while taking out his already empty pipe.

Aunt Shupao was tearing broken socks under the eaves, pulling out the sock yarn and making it into a ball. Seeing Uncle Shupao sitting on the threshold sighing, she turned her face and glanced at him: "Old thing, mind your own business. Take care of yourself. You won't die if you smoke a few less pipes. Didn't Wang Er, who carries groceries on a pole, say that when he went to the city to buy some goods, he suffered all the anger of those Japanese soldiers, almost had his felt hat taken off, and was beaten until blood was foaming from his teeth, and he was hit with two gun butts in the kidneys. He swore not to go to the city anymore, sold off his stock, and would rather starve to death at home, so that even if you have money, you can't buy tobacco." She said viciously.

"See what day these evil ghosts will make it to..." Uncle Shupao interrupted, disappointed.

But the mother and son of the Pockmarked Ma family in the small house were arguing even more fiercely. Curses, wails, and the sound of breaking bowls came one after another. Aunt Shupao, who had just told Shupao not to mind other people's business, dropped the broken socks and yarn ball and ran to the small house first. She muttered in her mouth: "Alas, arguing, arguing, even if they argue to the sky, they are still mother and son... What benefit can come out of arguing..."

Just as Aunt Shupao was about to step over the threshold of the small house, the son of the Pockmarked Ma family desperately rushed out of the house, followed by the wife of the Pockmarked Ma, her face pale with anger, panting, holding a door bolt in her hand, obviously intending to chase and beat her son. Aunt Shupao was quick-witted and quick-handed, grabbed her and said: "What's wrong? Why are you so angry? Calm down. Mother and son, what's the big deal? You can always discuss it. After your Pockmarked Ma died, he left you with this precious seed, and there are no other sons or daughters there."

"Aunt, let me go, uh. Today I must beat him half to death. This unfilial son, does he still have me as his mother in his eyes!" The wife of the Pockmarked Ma could not get rid of her anger for a while.

Aunt Shupao finally persuaded and dragged her to her own door, and gave her a stool to sit on. "Hehe, Ma's family, everything can only be done carelessly these days." Uncle Shupao stroked his whiskers and stood up from the threshold, saying this.

"To be honest, Uncle and Aunt, I am willing to obey him in everything else, but I will not agree to this!" The wife of the Pockmarked Ma gritted her teeth, looking very determined. Aunt Shupao asked first: "What exactly is going on?" The wife of the Pockmarked Ma 'hummed' and then said a long string:

"What's going on! He is going to work for the Japanese soldiers as a coolie, building roads! Tell me if he has any conscience. Pockmarked Ma was shot to death by a Japanese soldier next to the road, for no reason, died so pitifully: lying on the ditch, his head was smashed to pieces, the blood flowing into the ditch, the brains flowing into the ditch. At that time, the Japanese soldiers had just arrived, and no one dared to collect the body during the day. Uncle and Aunt all know that it was Jiangbei people from the ancestral hall who stole it back in the night: this unfilial son, hasn't he seen it? Now he doesn't want to avenge his father, but he wants to work for the Japanese soldiers. Hmph, making money! I don't care about a thousand taels of silver, I would rather starve to death, but I can't let him earn blood money... I want him to see his father: the body of the Pockmarked Ma..." When she said this, her voice trembled so much that she couldn't continue, and she cried loudly on purpose.

Uncle Shupao also felt indignant after hearing this, and knocked his early tobacco pipe on the stone slab, intending to find the son of the Pockmarked Ma in the village to admonish him. "No one in our village is allowed to be a traitor!" He muttered to himself.

### A Death That Is Not Lonely

— Liu You

Life is like a drama, it always has an end.

Countless people are born in silence, and they will die in silence!

Life and death are like one. With life, there is destruction. Life is like a budding flower, praised by people. Death, however, is a terrible thing hidden in the darkness, and the living do not need this rest!

But death also has a brilliant light, praised and sung by people, it has an amazing brilliance.

This is the most magnificent historical drama, created for liberation and freedom.

This death drives away ghosts and monsters from the living world, and builds justice for the living human beings.

The honored death is singing: "This is not that ordinary death, this is life, without darkness; these thousands of deaths create the light of this world!"

Death appeared in the flames, and that majestic shout awakened all people!

Death appeared in the pool of blood, with a beautiful smile, scaring away the enemies of all mankind!

Death, brave death, great death!

Let us not weep for the dead, or pity them, let alone be silent and pray for them!

Sing for the dead, cheer for the dead, this willingness to die will never be erased.

This death is not lonely!

### See Who Is Stronger

### Farewell

— Yu Maokang

Farewell to the young Zhu Qi who is going to war. This glass of wine is to see off my friend who is going to war,

This glass of wine is to strengthen your determination to fight;

To strengthen your journey on the distant road,

Don't be trivial, no one needs to be sad.

I knew long ago that you would not live a life of dependence on the suffocating "isolated island",

You have the ambition to fly and entrust your life to it!

Go, young friend; take advantage of the beginning of this spring breeze,

You should finish this glass and wish you success.

Remember the Double Tenth National Day when you were young,

For the sake of slogans, you were accused of disturbing the peace!

Although you suffered many interrogations and tortures,

How could you succumb to your stubborn personality!

This experience here has made you feel greater indignation,

It also laid a solid and unbreakable fighting spirit.

Now, in order to survive, you are rushing to the sacred battlefield,

Don't look back and don't look forward, we are still following.

### In Spring

— Diàn Cháng (Pen name)

Warrior, Talented Scholar, Cat, Old Man Episode.

It is now spring. Yes, it brings warmth, comfort, vigor, and the vitality of life. We rejoice in spring, which often brings warmth, vigor, and the vitality of life. Spring may have its seductive qualities, but it must never cause brave and rational warriors to be depressed, annoyed, or restless. Although they in the frozen, cloudy land become more active in the spring, continuing the more fierce struggle, Shelley said: "If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" Yes, this is the spring.

"In the third month of late spring, the grasses of Jiangnan grow long; various flowers bloom on trees, and orioles fly in confusion." This is originally a phenomenon of spring, but it has not yet grasped the rich meaning of spring. We love Jiangnan, and we also love Jiangbei; we love long grass, and we love various flowers; we also love the White Mountains, and we love the Black Water; we even love ice and snow, and we love wind and rain, and we love sleet and hail, and we love thunder and lightning. The land of the motherland is warm everywhere, with its fragrance, even if it is not in spring. In the spring, we express even greater love, and all that we have is always greater strength, and we are always promoting the power of strong combat.

In the feeling of some talented scholars, spring will become lazy and entangled: "What can be done with such a beautiful day and scenery? Whose courtyard is full of delightful events?" Isn't this the trouble of young girls in spring? "A ten-thousand-gold sword is hidden in autumn waters, and a full horse of spring sorrows presses on the embroidered saddle." That was originally the sexual melancholy of a heroic spring, prone to melancholy and illness. There are not a few romantic talented scholars under the heavens, "The flowing water and falling flowers are gone with spring, in heaven and on earth." This is precisely the sound of heartbreak before decline, "Leave the soul there, and the remaining body begs for ashes; the green phosphorescent fire does not diminish, and illuminates the Yan Terrace every night!" "Young heads," those who lose their integrity in the spring cannot help but vent secretly, although they still have such a veiled appearance.

Let us sing the greatness of the power of spring, even if some people dare not face it squarely.

This year's spring's arrival brings with it solemnity and coldness, but we use even more tragic and joyful hearts to caress it, and then let it fly past leisurely: next year's spring will come again!

That's right, it will come, next year's spring. But even if it is spring, flowers will not grow on cold white bones. The sad emotions of the Bushido talented scholars are triggered, and they are angry, resentful, distressed, and worried: "The person in the spring boudoir dream," then sighs a wisp of faint long breath. Apart from the venting of barbaric bestiality, it is just a heart full of emptiness: "Waiting is having a home but not being able to return, ah, ah, ah!"

So the joke of spring comes; the cat is calling spring on the eaves, and the Bushido talented scholars under the eaves, hearing it, immediately hysterically go crazy: finally, a general attack is launched, and a small team makes a general encirclement: bang, bang, bang! The call of spring stops abruptly, and the cat falls down. But it is even more lonely, and the talented scholars are even more desolate: "A symbol of melancholy!" Furrowing their brows and gnashing their teeth, they feel the same as the cat, in the spring.

However, there is no spring in their country: "The authorities of that country yesterday entertained film industry experts, explaining the government's newly passed laws, prohibiting young people throughout the country from watching love films; at the same time, the inspection authorities believe that films depicting the lucky games have a bad influence, and are also prohibited (according to a Haitong telegram on April 6)." Good heavens, they first strangled the cat's heart like this. They themselves have aged early: refusing to admit that this is spring—but even if they want to "return to youth," it is also "impossible to turn the tide": to prevent this spring, they first implemented the work of castration. (As for the insane enjoyment of the military-industrial capitalists, as usual, they turn a blind eye; this is two hundred million new taxes at work.)

They don't give you recognition, shout, "Young talented scholars swallow their anger" (the Bushido "wailing to the heavens" spirit has long lost its tradition.), but this reflection increasingly shows its unstable foundation.

At the end of the generous Aixinjueluo dynasty, although it also reached the period of its final splendor, the skill of "receiving the mandate of heaven" was done quite beautifully. Yu Yue, responding to the examination of "faint smoke, sparse rain, falling flowers day," had the line "flowers fall but spring remains," which greatly pleased the officials. (See Spring Dwelling Hall Notes.) That catered to the ruler's psychology of "concealing" the inevitable decline of the world. "Spring often stays here, ah!" Ah, now, they have not been heard to ah again. Merely "concealing twice, to comfort loneliness," the Aixinjueluo ruling class itself's "emptiness" is already clear. However, that dynasty's not shying away from the phenomenon of decline of "falling flowers day" undoubtedly still had great courage. They admitted spring.

In the period of decline, still castrating spring, a certain ××'s collapse is imminent!! Whether you admit spring or not, it's up to you.

A certain warrior filled in a "Divination Song" in suffering, although it also had some talented scholar meaning, it quite showed his fighting spirit. The latter half of the poem is: "Flowers fall, knowing spring is gone, let the wind and rain be; believing that spring will come again next year, there should be fragrance as before."

Even if this year's spring is serious and cold, we greet it with tragic and joyful hearts; the arrival of next year's spring will be warmer, and we will be even more joyful.

Secrets of Officialdom

### Idle Talk on the Clothing of Several Important People

— Hè Hóng (Pen name)

Each set of clothing of Chairman Chiang does not exceed one hundred yuan in price.

Madam Wellington Koo's collection of clothes is most scientifically done.

Our highest leader often cautions his subordinates, saying: Clothing is not about being luxurious, but it must absolutely be kept neat and clean. As for our Chairman Chiang, how he dresses, the general public probably very much want to know, right? To say that his clothes are truly a model for the people of the country, he is not like a certain general, deliberately pretentious, but appropriately expresses the demeanor of a leader. Ordinary casual clothes never exceed the price of one hundred yuan per set, emphasizing simplicity, durability, and domestic products. The color he likes is tan. Only that special-grade general's uniform was made at a higher cost. However, he wears it very few times and stores it very well. His clothes have long been made by a tailor at Hua Pai Lou. When the political center moved to Hankou last time, that tailor also moved to Jianghan Road, so the Chairman's clothes have always been made by them. That general's uniform used to be dry-cleaned by "Verdun," but now with environmental obstacles, I am afraid that his old man's cleaning of this suit will be a little troublesome, because Chongqing and other places do not have such high-end facilities. Madam Wellington Koo, Huang Huilan, has lived in Europe and America for a long time and is deeply influenced by Westernization. She is also particularly particular about clothing, especially its collection, which is done entirely according to scientific procedures. Each season when she changes her clothes, they must be dry-cleaned one by one. According to her introduction to Zhang Xueliang's wife, Yu Fengzhi: Based on her experience, among all the laundry shops in Shanghai (it can also be said in all of China), only the Verdun Dry Cleaning shop on Xavia Road near Hua Long Road suits her heart best. Later, when Ms. Yu traveled to various countries and returned to Shanghai, she also told her close friends, praising Ms. Huang's rich experience and strict selection, truly Verdun's work can be compared with those of Britain, France, and the United States. (Note: Verdun's telephone number is 83388)

Spring and Autumn

### Relief for Educated Youth

— Yù Quán (Pen name)

On the second of this month, it was reported that an elementary school teacher, driven by life, became mentally deranged and had no choice but to commit theft twice. On the 11th, it was reported again that more than 200 female students who had graduated from a certain university in Nanjing and young people with secondary and higher education levels were reduced to beggars due to difficult living conditions. Reading these two news items, we are truly very heartbroken. They are all educated young people with advanced knowledge. Because life on the isolated island is not easy, they cannot establish themselves in society. It is truly necessary to arouse social attention and, more urgently, to provide them with relief.

Currently, the International Relief Committee is conducting a detailed investigation into the reasons why they have become beggars, so that the committee can provide them with edification and education. This method is naturally very good, but I think they should be sent to the interior, or do some practical work on the isolated island. In this way, their lives can be resolved, and they can also do some work for the country's war effort. Otherwise, even if they are rescued, their profound knowledge will still be buried.

It is very obvious why they have been reduced to beggars. Who bestowed this upon them? They themselves also understand very well that this is entirely due to the oppression of the invaders. I can be sure that each of them has a heart full of fervent anger. They have not failed to think of revenge, but in the end, it is always because of the weakness of manpower, a lone hand clapping makes no sound, and they cannot find a suitable opportunity, which leads them to fall to this point. They will definitely not be willing to rely on others for relief for a long time; they must seek their own greatest way out.

Now, the International Relief Committee is working hard for the livelihood of these unemployed people. We hope that the committee will organize national salvation groups for them, so that they can work separately at all levels, or teach them production skills, or help them to go to the interior. In this way, satisfactory results can be obtained, and it is also the only way for fundamental relief.

At the same time, we hope that these many unemployed educated young people can bury themselves in hard work in such a difficult environment, not burying their own knowledge and abilities, and earnestly start national salvation work!

### On "Native Place Associations"

— Fán Jǐ (Pen name)

If we could analyze the various organizations in Shanghai in detail, then we would be able to discover that their nature and purpose are all different and have differences. For example, some are organizations with a religious color, such as the YMCA, the YWCA, and the like; some are of a nature that promotes proper entertainment, such as the Hua Lian Amusement Association, the Yi You Society, etc.; still others, such as the Jingwu Athletic Association, etc., are dedicated to physical training. In addition, in banks, foreign firms, and various businesses, taking advantage of spare time, dozens of like-minded comrades gather together for the purpose of studying academics and entertaining, and such organizations are too numerous to count. Indeed, every citizen living in Shanghai can be said to have the opportunity to join some organization or club in order to obtain a happy group life.

Speaking of organizations in Shanghai, we can probably all easily think of an organization called the "Native Place Association," right? The purpose of establishing a "Native Place Association" is the same as that of other organizations, which is to increase people's welfare and improve their lives. However, in general terms, because they are limited to "native place" reasons, their field is much smaller than other organizations.

In the beginning, Shanghai was still a desolate white land, and of course, there was no such thing as a "Native Place Association." It was not until later that Shanghai was opened as a port for trade, so trade flourished, business prospered, and Shanghai slowly embarked on the road to prosperity. At the same time, the number of business people who came to Shanghai from other places to make a living also gradually increased from a small number. Speaking of which, among the current four or five million people in Shanghai, very few can truly be called "Shanghainese." Most of them can be said to have moved to Shanghai from other places at that time to do business and work, and thus lived there for a long time. This group of people from all over the world, because of the differences in their respective dialects and customs, of course, when they meet "fellow villagers," they will always appear particularly affectionate and friendly. Therefore, over time, in order to seek the welfare and convenience of each "fellow villager," they gathered together and organized various "Native Place Associations" in order to use collective strength to do some beneficial things for individuals in a foreign land and fulfill some responsibilities of mutual assistance and relief.

The above can be said to be a general account of the origin of "Native Place Associations" in Shanghai. At present, their influence has indeed expanded to a very large and wide area. Their every move not only affects "fellow villagers," but is also enough to affect "strangers." Among them, the Ningbo Native Place Association, the Pudong Native Place Association, and several others are the most famous. Nowadays, almost everyone living in Shanghai knows the business they do.

I have already said that the purpose of organizing "Native Place Associations" is to promote various welfare undertakings that are beneficial to "fellow villagers." Therefore, things like providing medical treatment and medicine, establishing guild halls, establishing schools, and all other charitable undertakings, various native place associations are almost all trying their best to carry out. After the prelude to the "August 13th" war was unveiled the year before, the work done by the "Native Place Associations" became even more intense. They exhausted all kinds of methods, driving trucks to the war zones in the line of fire to rescue "fellow villagers" from danger, and, moreover, changed the guild halls located in the concessions into "refugee shelters" for the temporary accommodation of general "fellow villagers"... Anyone who sees this kind of great spirit of service will probably feel gratified and admired.

We all know that the power of "fellow villagers" uniting together can be said to be the easiest and most solid in the relationship between people. Therefore, Sun Yat-sen also said that we should make good use of and maximize the organization of "Native Place Associations" to strengthen the power of the group and expand the scope of the gathering (the general idea is like this). So, now that China is growing up in a difficult and arduous situation, the power of this "Native Place Association" is even more precious and should be used, without a doubt. Indeed, why should we limit ourselves to the name of "fellow villagers"? We must strengthen and expand this kind of organization, from fellow villagers, to fellow provincials, to fellow countrymen, and make every Chinese person a solid link in the process of the War of Resistance, with one heart and one mind, and everyone embracing the determination to live together and die together. Then, the arrival of the final victory, I can guarantee, will definitely be a matter of the shortest possible time.

### Mr. Wang Finds It Hard to Eat

— Sī Jìng (Pen name)

Since Ye Qianyu's Mr. Wang became popular, it seems that Tianyi Film Company was the first to bring the characters from this comic onto the screen. After that, Tang Jie, who played Mr. Wang, also seemed to have produced several Mr. Wang movies himself. However, in the past, because they were too focused on "slapstick," the audience's impression of the Mr. Wang movies seemed not as profound as the comics. This is a very obvious example: shoddy work is bound to fail, although it can deceive the audience for a time. Since the War of Resistance, Mr. Wang Tang Jie has also set off with the National Salvation Drama Troupe to the interior. When he returned to Shanghai, in a difficult journey of more than a year, he must have seen more and more valuable things. This first Mr. Wang movie after the war, "Mr. Wang Finds It Hard to Eat," we cannot deny that it has some progress compared to previous works.

First of all, he noticed the most realistic theme of a depressed society where it is "hard to eat" everywhere. Moreover, from the theme of Mr. Wang finding it hard to eat, he reflected the various aspects of hardship, treachery, and the coldness of human relationships. For example, when Mr. Wang was doing small business, he finally changed industries because of a local ruffian's extortion of "tribute." When Mr. Wang took office, because the name "Wang Sheng" and his "getup" were not in the eyes of the messenger, he enjoyed being turned away. But when Mr. Wang explained that he was the secretary, the messenger respectfully offered cigarettes and tea, being condescending first and respectful later. Also, the messenger was afraid of not serving him well, and the innkeeper knelt down to beg for forgiveness. "Mr. Wang Finds It Hard to Eat" has done its best to satirize. Here is the most adorable scene, which is Mr. Wang chasing after banknotes, which symbolizes the ugly state of humans chasing after banknotes.

"Mr. Wang Finds It Hard to Eat" also mentioned family problems and women's problems. For example, because Mr. Wang was unemployed, his wife took his daughter away. In the end, Mr. Wang remarried, and when his daughter knew that her husband was her father, she said, "Father has ruined me!" But "Mr. Wang Finds It Hard to Eat" also has its shortcomings. For example, the above two problems are only used as dramatic insertions. After Mr. Wang was rescued after throwing himself into the river, he said, "Death is cowardly, I want to fight!" The movie did not tell us how to fight, but Mr. Wang accidentally became a secretary, which inevitably makes people have a fluke mentality.

Regarding the past Mr. Wang movies, I have seen very few. Whether Tang Jie's Mr. Wang has improved compared to before, I don't know, but I feel that his movements have quite a bit of a comic style. As for the slapstick, such as after Mrs. Wang ran away, Mr. Wang encountered couples everywhere in the park, and feeding the fish when eating sesame cakes, etc., were all very adorable. The scene of Mr. Wang setting up a character-splitting stall: the clown singing on the open-air stage snatched his customers, and he angrily smashed the character stall. When Mr. Wang fell to the ground, just connecting to the "Joining the Army, Leaving the Kiln" section, Mr. Wang put the broken tabletop over his head, and the clown father continued singing "Escorting," which shows the director's cleverness.

Episode 8: Is it Illusion or Reality, Acting on the Spot; Is it Appropriate to Go or Stop, Being at Home Everywhere

Let's talk about Zhu Ai'ren having booked for the two Miss He's to go to Freedom Village next week. On Friday afternoon, she suddenly received a call from Wu Junsu, inviting them to go to her school to see a play on Saturday night. It turned out that the College of Arts of this Soochow University had a Department of Drama. Although this Department of Drama is not a required subject of the College of Arts, many university students study this subject. These male and female students also organized a Drama Comrades Research Association themselves, discussing and studying normally, and giving public performances two or three times a year. In addition, they also have theatrical performances when there are any public or private commemorative days. This is not a professional theatrical performance, but just something for those who love drama to use as entertainment. There is a small theater in the school, and although it is a small theater, it has seats for more than a thousand people. This theater is not only for theatrical performances. Sometimes, the school also holds lectures in this theater. Also, other cultural organizations in Suzhou hold major grand gatherings, or welcome foreign celebrities and invite them to give speeches, and they all borrow this theater. Because many cultural organizations are gathered together, Soochow University is always a part of it. But the theater is used the most often when it is open for film screenings. Could it be that Soochow University has opened a cinema as a side business of the school? This is definitely not the case. There are also many cinemas open in Suzhou, and Soochow University will definitely not steal their business. The films shown in Soochow University's theater are mostly academic. As everyone knows, the development of film in recent times is a great help in the evolution of the world. Its power for social education and cultural propaganda is the greatest, and it is not only for entertainment. Since the invention of television, the progress of film has truly been the supreme authority in the academic world. I don't need to say how far the progress of film has gone. Just saying that scientists can use film to explain everything they invent, and often what cannot be explained clearly in words, can be clearly understood by outsiders by opening the film. Of course, these films are popular and profound, and there are many kinds. In short, they open people's minds, help people's knowledge, and benefit the people. Recently, because of the progress of films in various countries and the extreme convenience of transportation, international films are exchanged and shown to each other. Currently, the most developed country in the world for films is still the United States, but the second country is the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has the most films on academic subjects. Icebergs, snow islands, submarines, and airplanes are shown a lot, and the United States has recently changed its style. (85)

### 1939: Predictions from the American Film Industry

— Jing Yuan

Every year at the beginning, American film magazines often publish articles of the "Silver Screen Predictions of the Year" type. The following predictions were published in the New York Times, written by the famous film reporter Mr. Krauss. This article has two characteristics: first, it talks about general events in the film industry, different from other predictions that focus on the personal lives of stars. Second, it is specific about the names of the people involved and the months of occurrence, unlike general predictions that are vague and ambiguous. The strangest thing is that the predictions for January and February actually came true. Here, I will transcribe his predictions below:

January:

The names of five Canadian child star students will appear continuously in the telegraphic news columns of various newspapers, but it will have nothing to do with films.

(Note: This prediction has already come true, as the New York World's Fair invited five child star students in January to attend and perform at the opening ceremony on May 1st. This news was published in all newspapers.)

Louise Rainer, the lead actress in "The Good Earth," will receive some kind of award.

(Note: This prediction has also come true, as Louise Rainer flew across the United States last year and won the 1938 Travel Award, which was presented in January.)

February:

Charlie Chaplin will officially announce the content of his new work.

(Note: This prediction has been confirmed. Charlie Chaplin released his new film "The Great Dictator" in February, with content satirizing dictators.)

The gold medal for best acting in 1938 will not belong to Bette Davis but to another more prestigious actress.

(Note: This prediction also came true. On February 23, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced that the winner was Norma Shearer, the lead actress in "Marie Antoinette." Bette Davis's ranking was after Norma Shearer.)

March:

Famous director Frank Borzage will fall ill.

Carole Lombard will be involved in a lawsuit due to income tax issues.

(Note: The above two predictions have not been confirmed.)

April:

Clark Gable's wedding to Carole Lombard in Benne will be postponed for some reason.

(Note: Clark Gable married Carole Lombard late last month, and was not postponed for any reason.)

May:

Goldwyn will gather many famous writers to co-write a film script, but it will not be filmed in the end.

June:

Leslie Howard will finance and produce a film himself.

Major film companies will compete to purchase a famous script. As a result, MGM will win, but it will be prohibited from filming by the Film Censorship Bureau.

July:

Three Soviet defense films will be screened publicly in New York, one of which will cause protests from the Japanese side.

Greta Garbo will return to her home country again.

August:

Child star Shirley Temple will suffer from a surgical disease and will need surgery.

20th Century Fox Film Corporation will change its internal organization, and a certain star will have a lawsuit with the company authorities.

September:

Charles Boyer will receive a honorary award.

Charlie Chaplin's new work will be completed, and he will announce his official divorce from Paulette Goddard.

October:

Mary Pickford's cosmetics company will make a significant profit.

Horror star Boris Karloff will travel to Europe.

November:

Charlie Chaplin's completed new film will be praised by some audiences, but opposed by others.

Robert Taylor will have a car accident, but will only suffer minor injuries.

December:

Child star Mickey Rooney will receive a strange gift for Christmas.

Among all film companies, the one with the highest profit will be RKO Pictures.

### Tong Ling's Tan School Sheng Actor Li Yuqi Will Come to Shanghai

— Wei Shan

Tong Ling's Tan School sheng actor Li Yuqi, is currently thirteen years old, with a beautiful face and a smart mind. When he was seven or eight years old, he studied at a primary school in Shanghai, where he was exceptionally intelligent and always ranked first in every test. He especially loved Chinese opera. Later, his father fulfilled his wishes and asked him to learn Chinese opera from the famous dramatist Mr. Zhou Zichan. After a little guidance, he was able to understand it immediately. After three years of apprenticeship, he participated in several free performances in Shanghai, winning praise from the general public. Celebrities such as Yu Qiaqing and Du Yuesheng greatly appreciated him, and his stage name became well-known. Recently, he was hired by the Danggui Stage in Yantai and performed on stage for two months. Every day was fully booked, which shows that his art is extraordinary. The writer has watched his "Empty City Stratagem," "Beheading Ma Su," and "Arresting and Releasing Cao" plays. His appearance is delicate, his stage presence is generous, his singing is round and flavorful, his recitative is clear and accurate, and his performance is meticulous. Among the tong ling, he is indeed outstanding. It is heard that once Mr. Li's contract in Yantai expires, he will return to Shanghai.

### Wang Wenyu and Si Yigui Will Hold a Concert

Soloist Ms. Wang Wenyu and Mr. Si Yigui will hold a vocal concert at the American Women's Club (577 Jing'an Temple Road) at 8:30 PM on the 16th of this month.

### News of the Theater Circle

Zhang Yicong Suddenly Suffers from Measles

The Yifeng Drama Society of the Carlton Theater gave its first performance of two Ben Wenson plays last night, and the attendance was extremely high. Kun Dan Zhang Yicong suffered from severe throat problems and was unable to perform on stage. The role of Su'e, which she plays, is very important, so Zhou Xinfang sent Ma Jinfeng to temporarily take her place and temporarily instructed her on the play.

Li Xinfu Resigns from the Class for the Second Time

Li Xinfu, a veteran martial arts actor at the Xianshi Amusement Park, felt that the rehearsals behind the scenes were not cooperating, which led to burnout. He had resigned from the class twice to the authorities, but was retained by Zhang Liankui, the manager behind the scenes. However, Li's determination to leave is firm, and he will still post a resignation notice to the backstage.

Xiao Wenbin to Perform as Empress

The Empress Theater wanted to hold Peking Opera performances and invited Yang Baotong and others to perform, but it did not work out. Now the theater has decided that from the 16th, the Xiao Wenbin Shanghai Opera Troupe will perform.

Xuan Gang Organizes a Dance Troupe

Musician Xuan Gang plans to organize a dance troupe to perform in various theaters in Shanghai in rotation. He has already started everything and is publicly soliciting talents.

### Drama News

The Sino-French Drama School has received many positive reviews from all walks of life after its first practical performance. Therefore, in order to meet the current needs, the school has jointly organized a weekly experimental performance with the New-Sino Company, and cooperated with the Shanghai Amateur Drama Association, which has a large number of excellent actors. The venue is the Green Mai Theater. The first phase has been decided to be held at 10:00 am this Sunday. The first play is "Little Husband" written by Zhang Min and directed by Bai Li, which is an anti-feudal play. The second is "The Affected Young Ladies," originally written by Molière and translated by Feng Zhizhong, which sharply satirizes those who are obsessed with modernity. It is a comedy, directed by Xu Xingzhi. It is also heard that the school and the New-Sino Company authorities advocate universality, so the ticket price is uniformly set at four corners (including refugee donations).

The famous British play "Strife" by John Galsworthy is a world-famous three-act social tragedy. Recently, the Juyi Society is rehearsing the play, directed by the famous director Wu Renzhi. The actors include Zhang Jie, Xu Li, Zhang Wanjun, etc. The performance is sure to be very exciting.

### Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (145)

— Xu Muyun

The names of the characters in the "Four Scholars" play are mostly meaningful

Group plays are the best to watch in Peking Opera. Like "Battle of Wancheng," "Famen Temple," and "Zhai Ying Hui," they are all large dramas performed by sheng, dan, jing, and chou, but compared to them, they are not as lively as "Four Scholars." This play has qingyi (Yang Suzhen), huadan (Wan Shi), zuogong laosheng (Song Shijie), yinglizi laosheng (Mao Peng), xiaosheng (Tian Lun), and wusheng (Bao Tongtian). In addition, there is a main character, Tian Shi, who is played by a tie dan. In fact, this role can be played by a handsome caitan, which would make it even more complete. All of the ten or so people mentioned above occupy important positions in this play, which is different from ordinary plays where only three or four protagonists are important, and the other supporting roles only appear and disappear at will. In general, people think that Song Shijie is the main character of the play, like Sun Juxian, Pan Yueqi in the past and Zhou Xinfang and Ma Lianliang now. However, if their supporting roles do not include outstanding huadan and huamian (comparatively speaking, Wan Shi and Gu Du are more important) to assist them, I am afraid it will be difficult to see the wonderfulness in many of the "cover kou." Because cover kou is the most close-knit and strict when two people answer or argue. Shanghai people say "hard-hitting," which is what this means. If one of the two people is weaker, or hesitates when answering, then the play loses its brilliance.

The person who wrote this play that day was indeed someone who was well-versed in the law and experienced in officialdom. He revealed all the dark secrets of officialdom protecting each other, engaging in favoritism and malpractice in the autocratic era, and the difficulty for poor and lowly people to redress their grievances. And he presented two righteous and courageous Song Shijie and Yang Chunlai, who avenged the murder of Yang Suozhen's husband on her behalf, and sued two frontier grand historians and a seventh-rank magistrate in one go. Although Song and Yang are both commoners, it can be said that they have no power to speak of, but one can be proficient in the law, and the other can be unyielding, as long as they seize the ironclad evidence of Tian and Gu's bribery, and discover their weaknesses in eating dirty food, then they are not afraid that their officials will be removed and their heads will be moved. Don't look down on Song and others as small people, as long as their reasoning is correct, they dare to clash with the officials of the first and third ranks. It was indeed possible to give the little people under the hoofs a sigh of relief, and also to give a warning to the general corrupt officials if such a play could be written in the feudal era.
