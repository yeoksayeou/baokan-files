### Halifax Foreign Secretary Clarifies Key Points of British Far East Policy: Willing to Seek a Solution to the Sino-Japanese War, Handling the Background of the Tianjin Incident Realistically

Lord Halifax, British Foreign Secretary

(London) During today's Upper House debate on foreign affairs, Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax delivered a speech expressing his hope that the day would come when Britain could use its mediation to achieve a fair resolution to the Sino-Japanese War. The Foreign Secretary stated that he believed a solution that fairly treated China while also considering the interests of other powers with relations in the Far East was achievable through well-intentioned human efforts. The Foreign Secretary refuted misunderstandings regarding the recent Anglo-Japanese agreement and reiterated that the British government's policy towards China had not changed. He stated that everything the government had done was to recognize what already seemed to exist and to address the background of the Tianjin situation in a practical manner.

Defending the Tokyo Agreement

The Foreign Secretary, responding on behalf of the government, stated that several speeches in the House of Commons asserted that the recent agreement between Britain and Japan represented a fundamental shift in national policy. He noted claims that the agreement recognized the existence of a state of war in China, violating the spirit of Britain's obligations under League of Nations resolutions, posing a danger to British public interests, and that the government's actions had pardoned all past actions that Britain had previously condemned. "All these," the Foreign Secretary said, "are criticisms of the government." He declared that, in his judgement, those who made such arguments had disregarded both the clear terms of the agreement and the government's interpretation of it. The Foreign Secretary stated that, based on his experience in India, he knew it was extremely difficult for people sitting in London to accurately measure the precise meaning contained in any carefully worded plan from one side or the other, especially in the face of extreme national difficulties. "Therefore," he said, "it is difficult for the enemy to find more fertile ground to sow tares in a wheat field." He argued that those who made such sweeping accusations against the agreement ignored the crucial fact that the impression their accusations made that afternoon was precisely the impression that those who wished to increase any difficulties currently facing Britain would like to see created. Therefore, he concluded, critics needed to be careful and not be fooled, and that building great anxieties on the smallest of foundations was unhelpful.

Two Objectives of Anglo-Japanese Negotiations

The public should bear in mind that the Japanese government never asked the British government to change its general policy, and that if the Japanese government had made such a request, the British government would never have agreed. What Britain had done through this agreement was to acknowledge all the facts that appeared to exist and to try to deal with the background of the Tianjin situation in a practical way. It would have been difficult to reach a compromise on the Tianjin dispute if misunderstandings had not been listed in the agreement. Sir Robert Craigie (British Ambassador to Japan) was now tackling a very difficult situation with determination and understanding, striving to reach a solution. The government must not make its work more difficult through unnecessary words or deeds. Therefore, the government's actions had not been of a coercive nature, and it hoped that the government would not and should not act in this way in any reasonable circumstance in the future. While the government's policy aimed to promote peace and international order, its efforts had two goals: first, and most importantly, to find a solution that was fair to all parties concerned; and second, from the narrower perspective of British interests, to achieve a result in the current difficulties that did not damage relations between Britain and China or Japan. He knew that many members of the House would regard this as an overly optimistic hope, but he himself felt that the question of whether they could successfully achieve their goals did not depend entirely on themselves, but also on the attitude of the Japanese government and how prepared the Japanese authorities were to distinguish between local events that their government had recognized and general events, and how prepared they were not to regard general events as local events, or local events as general events.

Anti-British Movement is Serious

The Foreign Secretary then mentioned the recent remarks made by Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma when he met with journalists, saying that, according to reports from Sir Robert Craigie, much of what had been reported was inaccurate. If Hiranuma's remarks were indeed misreported, the government could not accept the implications they contained. The British government had to take a very serious view of the blockade of Tianjin and the increasing anti-British movement in the areas occupied by Japanese troops in China. If this movement continued unabated, relations between Britain and Japan would inevitably become more difficult. He believed that both the Japanese government and the public must recognize this point. The Anglo-Japanese agreement stipulated that the Japanese government was responsible for maintaining public order in the areas occupied by Japanese troops in China, so the British government hoped to use this agreement to stop anti-British propaganda in these areas. It was worth remembering that the British government also remembered that several of the points raised, although local in nature, had broader implications and were directly related to other governments.

Maintaining Contact with the US and France

"We have stated that we have common interests with the United States and France in several matters. In general, the objectives of the three governments are closely aligned. The British government attaches great importance to the cooperation between these three governments, and we keep the American and French governments informed of our intentions and actions at all times. This does not mean that the British, American, and French governments should take the same action at the same time. The recent negotiations between the United States regarding trade are an example. I know that the British government could also announce the abrogation of its trade agreement with Japan in the current environment, but as the Prime Minister said on Sunday, this requires extremely careful consideration and close consultation with the various Dominions. Therefore, I do not intend to make any further comments on this matter at this stage."

Recognizing Japan's Position in China

The Foreign Secretary then responded to a remark by Lord Davies, Vice-Chairman of the League of Nations Union, that the government's actions were driven by a desire to uphold existing rights, saying that he should not ignore a passage in a note that the British government had sent to Japan earlier this year, drawing attention to the fact that Britain had already been engaged in negotiations with the Chinese government on extraterritoriality in 1931, which had almost been completed before being halted by the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. However, in the note to Japan, the British government continued to state that it was still prepared to resume these negotiations at an appropriate time and was prepared to discuss such and other issues with a restored and fully independent Chinese government. Therefore, the British government's formation of its policy did not aim to maintain the entire structure of the old treaties unchanged. At the same time, the British government had never concealed its views on Japan's actions in China. "We are fully prepared to acknowledge the special interests and position that Japan demands in China due to its geographical location and economic needs," he said.

Studying Methods to Stabilize Chinese Currency

The Foreign Secretary continued, "Regarding the issues of Chinese currency and the disposal of silver deposits in Tianjin, various solutions have been proposed, but none seem satisfactory. The British government is currently continuing to review all possibilities, but when considering these matters, we cannot ignore our obligations to the Chinese government and the other signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty. Any proposal to continue supporting Chinese currency, whether from a Chinese perspective, is something we believe is necessary, and we will also consider it in light of the many other financial considerations and obligations that Britain currently has."

Importance Attached to Detention of British Military Officer

The Foreign Secretary also stated that the detention of British military officer Colonel Spear by the Japanese authorities in Zhangjiakou was extremely unsatisfactory. Sir Robert Craigie had repeatedly made representations to the Japanese government, and the Japanese side had replied that the case was almost fully investigated. A few days ago, the Japanese government had stated that it hoped the case could be resolved soon. The Japanese side had not explained Spear's prolonged detention, and the British government had made its feelings on the matter clear to the Japanese side. As for Spear's diplomatic privileges, he stated that there was no doubt that he enjoyed them.

Foreign Secretary Expresses Hope in Conclusion

The Foreign Secretary concluded his speech by saying that, in view of the various difficult situations in the Far East, those in responsible positions should bear the responsibility of looking to the future and clearing away the obstacles in front of them in order to achieve true goals. In the Far East, this goal was not, as former Foreign Office official Lord Cecil had suggested, about the choice of paths, but seemed to have broader consequences and greater dangers than Cecil had seen, but it must be tried in order to achieve a fair resolution of the current disputes. He hoped that the day would come when Britain could use its good offices to achieve a fair resolution to the Sino-Japanese War and believed that a solution that fairly treated China while also considering the interests of other powers with relations in the Far East was achievable through well-intentioned human efforts.

### Questioning by British Upper House Members

(London) In today's Upper House debate on the Far East situation, opposition leader Lord Snell spoke first, saying that the Far East situation still seemed disappointing. He did not mean that Britain alone was responsible, but he was surprised that the Tokyo agreement had been reached so quickly, unlike the slow progress of the Moscow talks.

Lord Cecil, Chairman of the League of Nations Union, then spoke, saying that he was not enthusiastic about Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement about a fair resolution to the Sino-Japanese War. He believed that this showed that the government was inclined to place China and Japan on an equal footing in this war. He believed that Japan's strategy was the most unjust event in world history. Japan's aim was to first control China, then Asia, and to exclude all European countries and people from any part or business of Asia. The policies of the Japanese militarists were the same as the current policies of Germany, probably because the Japanese militarists were trained by the Germans, who not only taught them military skills, but also instilled in them their views on government and international affairs. He hoped that the Foreign Secretary would inform the Upper House of what parallel steps the British government intended to take regarding the American announcement of the abrogation of the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty. He wanted the government to make a more practical and clearer statement on its Far East policy. The Prime Minister's words made people doubt what the true British Far East policy was. The government should show that it was not afraid of Japanese retaliation. Japan had shown its utter disregard for all international obligations and all principles of fairness, while China had fulfilled all its obligations and acted in an absolutely appropriate manner. He believed that if Britain took actions that benefited Japan and harmed China, it would bring shame to Britain and give the impression of abandoning a country whose actions were well worth supporting. He knew that British territories in the Far East might face naval attacks, which would be difficult for Britain, but what Britain had to consider was what the likelihood was if Japan won in China. If so, everything Britain had would be swept away, because Japan, having destroyed China, would certainly turn to destroying Britain. Based on his experience in diplomatic negotiations with Japan, he knew that every concession to Japan only aroused Japan's insatiable demands. Lord Davies spoke, saying that Britain should support the Chinese government in every way possible and, if necessary, expel Japanese residents in the British Empire and sever economic ties with Japan. Former Home Secretary Lord Muir rose to say that the government should clarify that its remarks regarding the Tokyo agreement applied to the need to support Chinese currency. Now, the Chinese currency system had become the most important point of contention between Britain and Japan. Most of the difficulties in the Far East arose from the Japanese government's contradictory dual policies. Japanese politicians were often overwhelmed by the militarists, and the militarists were held hostage by their junior officers. The British Empire had no reason to allow its own policies to be dictated by the violent actions of colonels and majors in the Japanese army. "We now have every reason to believe that Japan is feeling painfully disappointed in its efforts to conquer China. Japan has had feelings of resentment and panic in the past two years, like a person sinking gradually into the mire. The Japanese militarists feel they must find a scapegoat to vent their resentment and panic, and Britain is now the scapegoat. The United States has moved its fleet from the Atlantic to the Pacific and has abrogated the trade agreement with Japan. These two moves are of great significance. Their motives are not only for their own interests in the Far East."

### British Company Printing Chinese Banknotes, Over 100 Million Sheets

(London) The Chinese government and the Central Bank have signed contracts with two British printing companies to print banknotes, totaling over 100 million sheets. The exact total or value of the banknotes cannot be disclosed. One of the companies has hired an additional 400 workers to cope with the demand and will need a year to complete the contract. The other contract has already been completed. The printing plates will be kept in Britain, and the banknotes will be shipped to China via various routes. (Reuters, 4th)

"It is also a responsibility to the world in general to act in this way. The American abrogation cannot be said to be purely for commercial reasons; it undoubtedly contains political implications. In this environment, the British government can be encouraged not to adopt any policy of succumbing to pressure. One thing that should be considered by the British government is that Australia has a great stake in all issues in the Pacific, especially in Anglo-Japanese relations. When the Manchurian Incident occurred, Australia's interests certainly had a major influence on the British government's thinking. I sincerely hope that the Australian government and public can understand that a policy of constant retreat is ultimately not a good plan, nor is it in line with the prestige or interests of the British Empire. The government has now taken steps to strengthen Singapore's defenses, which is welcome. If the Tokyo talks fail and Japanese pressure increases, the government should consider taking the same actions as the United States has already taken. If the government decides that it needs twelve months' notice to abrogate the Anglo-Japanese trade agreement, then the whole nation will support it. If so, Britain will have the means to join with the United States in exerting very effective economic pressure on Japan, which can stop supplies to Japan. Without these supplies, Japan will not be able to continue fighting." Former Australian Governor-General Lord Stonehaven rose to defend Australia because Lord Samuel's remarks had involved Australia, saying that Australia had sacrificed its very important trade with Japan for the sake of the entire British Empire. Lord Samuel replied that he did not mean that Australia had taken actions that were detrimental to Britain for its own interests. He only meant that, in the end, it might be necessary to take actions that were more forceful than those required solely by economic interests.

Lord Elibank, Chairman of the British Imperial Chamber of Commerce, asked the Foreign Secretary to state firmly to the Upper House that the government had no intention of handing over the silver deposits in Tianjin or recognizing the banknotes of the North China United Reserve Bank, because the Prime Minister's remarks on the matter in the Lower House were not very clear. Lord Elibank spoke of Japan's military position in China, saying that the adverse trend in Japan's trade balance was increasing, its gold reserves were decreasing, and the Chinese guerrilla warfare was preventing Japan from obtaining supplies of iron, coal, and cotton. Japan had suffered defeats in North China, and Soviet pressure was also reportedly forcing it to withdraw troops to Manchuria. In view of these facts, there was no possibility that Japan would declare war on Britain if Britain insisted. He believed that the moderates would eventually control the radicals, and Japan was not lacking in thoughtful people. Therefore, on the one hand, the Tokyo talks should be conducted, and on the other hand, preparations should be made to cooperate with the United States to take action. Britain should now take more forceful action. There would soon be a stalemate, at which time mediation could be conducted to end the war. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Tokyo Negotiations Still Stalled, Japan Continues Anti-British Demonstrations

(London) Reuters has learned that after receiving a report from Sir Robert Craigie, British Ambassador to Japan, on the progress of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, the British government has not yet telegraphed its views to Sir Robert Craigie. (Reuters, 3rd)

(Tokyo) 25,000 people from the city's commercial district held a demonstration in front of the British Embassy today, carrying flags with slogans such as "Down with Britain." Five representatives delivered a resolution to Mr. Cunningham of the British Embassy. Anti-British movements have also occurred in other cities in Japan. At the same time, Japanese newspapers are pessimistic about the progress of the British negotiations. (Reuters, 4th)

Editorial

### Britain's Wishes for the Far East

Britain's Far East policy, having been declared by Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons on July 31, was, three days later, the day before yesterday, again addressed by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in the House of Lords; the objects were the same, the matter was consistent, and the content was similar. This newspaper has already commented on Mr. Chamberlain's statements; now, regarding Mr. Halifax's statements, we will elaborate on what our previous discussion did not cover, grasping the essentials.

In the Foreign Secretary's speech, three points were particularly striking: first, the main goal of British policy was to seek a fair solution to the Far East crisis, taking into account the interests of all parties concerned, and then, on a smaller scale, taking into account Britain's own interests; but in its conduct, seeking to avoid harming the relations between China and Britain, and seeking to achieve this, contingent on the attitudes of China and Japan. Second, Britain did not seek to insist on various old privileges in China, as evidenced by the 1931 negotiations with the Chinese government on extraterritoriality; showing that Britain did not seek to adhere to established conventions, and did not seek to preserve the entire structure of the old treaties. Third, Britain would never condone aggression, but Japan, based on its geographical position and economic needs, had the right to demand and exercise special interests and positions in China, which Britain was fully prepared to recognize. These three points, when Britain discussed its Far East policy in the past, just as Prime Minister Chamberlain declared a week ago, often made similar revelations, but never as frankly as the Foreign Secretary said the day before yesterday.

What we should first clearly recognize is that the three points mentioned above by Mr. Halifax are Britain's wishes for the Far East in the future, not the policies that the British government is currently advancing in the Far East. From the wishes held to the advancement of policies, there is an immeasurable distance in both time and space, and even from the beginning of the advancement to the final decision of success or failure, there are not only immeasurable distances, but also countless detours. Therefore, we, living today, do not need to engage in flights of fancy about how the problem will be during the advancement of those wishes, and what the scene will be after realization, just because the British Foreign Secretary stated his wishes. However, there is something worth praising, which is that the first item mentioned above, called seeking a solution and calling it fair; fairness has its inevitable standards, not a vague phrase, not an empty cliché; moreover, seeking it without hindering the relations between China and Britain, it is especially impossible to seek completeness without fairness; this is praiseworthy. The second item mentioned above, called Britain's various things in China, must take the completely independent and autonomous Chinese government as its opponent; not wavering slightly, not allowing borrowing, transparent and firm, upright and wise; although it is said that things have a true position, how will Japan's treatment of China differ from Britain's treatment of France? How is the so-called economic need similar to Britain's treatment of India? If the so-called maintaining special, will there be another explanation other than the general international so-called preferential treatment, another explanation other than the open door and equal opportunity? All such things, the interpretation can be varied, the citation can be borrowed; but the Foreign Secretary said that he was fully prepared to recognize it, what is his intention? However, considering the full text of the Foreign Secretary's speech, it is absolutely impossible to pick and choose the third item mentioned above out of context and distort it; this is what we deeply believe in his original intention, and we only think that it would be better if it were not said like that.

Britain's wishes for the Far East are like this; Britain's economic and naval power are like that; using that power to extend these wishes, there are two ways. Accuse Japan of righteousness, inform Japan of the gains and losses, persuade Japan step by step, so that Japan can recognize Britain's wishes, abandon its aggressive actions, and jointly seek a fair solution. On the Chinese side, apart from the integrity of sovereignty, territory and administration, there is no other request; it is neither the initiator of the Far East dispute, nor does it bear the responsibility for the Far East dispute; in short, the key is not in China. This is one way, and it is probably what the British authorities most hope for; unfortunately, the Japanese are busy rejecting Britain, at least today, it is completely the opposite. Britain and China have a long history, close interests, and especially agree on international concepts and moral beliefs, and the origins of the two countries are far away; however, Britain's so-called rights and interests in China have not yet been considered deeply rooted; why, Britain must be in harmony with China, and must obtain the support of a completely independent and autonomous government of China, and Britain can maintain its rights and interests, try to prove with how Britain is in North China today, how it is in the Yangtze River Basin, how it is in southern Guangdong, and it is true that there is a relationship between the skin and the hair. Therefore, if Britain seeks to realize its wishes, in reality, it can only do its best to be of one heart and one mind with China.

### British Government Willing to Peacefully Resolve Dispute with Japan, Prime Minister Admits Navy is Out of Reach, Preserving Strength to Cope with European Events

(London) At today's morning meeting of the House of Commons, opposition Labor MP Baker raised questions about the Far East issue, to which Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "At present, the strength of our navy in the Far East is not as great as Japan's, but this is not the case in Europe. Under certain circumstances, it may be necessary to send a fleet to the Far East, but on the other hand, it is better to resolve disputes with Japan and discuss them through negotiations rather than using force, provided that the basic concepts and principles that we recognize are not harmed. Even if we decide to protect our expatriates in China by the final means, I am afraid it will be difficult to protect them all. In short, I am afraid that most of them cannot be protected, but we have an obligation to them and must always keep it in mind. Their situation is already precarious, and we should, within the possible range, not let them fall into an even more dangerous situation. Regarding the current negotiations in Tokyo, we have made it clear to the Japanese government that the issues of silver deposits in Tianjin and Chinese currency cannot be resolved by the British and Japanese governments alone. These issues are so closely related to each other that they not only involve our country, but also involve other countries, and must be discussed with other countries before they can be resolved." It is said that according to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference (previously held in Brussels, Belgium in November 1937), the declaration and the resolutions of the League of Nations, Britain has accepted the constraint to aid China and should declare the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty abolished. In fact, our country has not accepted any constraint to abolish the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty. Even if the treaty is abolished at this time, it will not take effect until twelve months later. Attached agreements must also be taken into account. "We have, under duress, accepted several extremely important responsibilities and constraints in Europe, and if something happens in the future, we must participate in the war. We could have accepted the same constraints in the Far East, but I am unwilling to do so. Although the magnitude of our country's resources is difficult to estimate, and the will of the people is very strong, we must be prudent in accepting a constraint, and there is a certain limit. It is said that the accidents that are currently occurring in the Far East are infuriating, and I really have the same feeling, and after hearing about certain incidents and reading certain documents, my blood pressure soars, but even if the emotions are extremely impulsive, we cannot forget the obligations that our country has accepted and the situation of the men and women in the Far East. More serious problems closer to our country may occur in the next few months, and we must consider them. Our country must preserve its strength to cope with all events," he said. (Havas, 4th)

### Labor Party Member of Parliament Condemns Japanese Atrocities

(London) This morning, the House of Commons held its last session of this term. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi and Soviet Ambassador Maisky were both present in the diplomatic seating area. Opposition Labour Party member of parliament, Baker, immediately initiated a debate on the Far East issue, stating that Japan is using extortion to force others to recognize its actions in China as legitimate. There have been thousands of incidents of British nationals being insulted. Japan's ultimate goal is to expel Westerners from Asia. "They are now using every means of tyranny to force our country to become an accomplice in the invasion of China. When the Tokyo negotiations began, our party expressed its concerns. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels once said that this negotiation is the Munich Conference of the East, which makes us even more uneasy. Furthermore, after the conclusion of the Anglo-Italian Agreement (signed on April 16, 1938), everything we gave to Italy has been taken away, and that country has not given us anything in return. This is a lesson to be learned. Prime Minister Chamberlain has stated that the Tokyo plan (referring to the preliminary Anglo-Japanese agreement) does not mean a change in Far Eastern policy, and that China's rights under international law will not be affected as a result. I am very pleased to hear this and would like to thank the Prime Minister. However, the Prime Minister must know how this plan is being interpreted by certain parties. Japan has no right to invade China. Whatever the intentions of our government when signing this plan, it is within certain limits. Recognizing the legitimacy of the Japanese government's actions in China, that government has used this plan as a starting point to propose various conditions, which are very broad and cannot be accepted. That country has also demanded that the British concessions maintain neutrality and proposed that the police departments of the British concessions should be jointly managed by Britain and Japan. However, the behavior of the Tianjin police, if it is the same as that of the Japanese police elsewhere, is truly frightening. As for the four Chinese suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, since the Japanese side has not presented evidence of the crime, it is not appropriate to extradite them. There are no legitimate courts in the Japanese-occupied areas of China. If these suspects are brought before a puppet court for trial, it would be tantamount to recognizing the puppet organization, which is unacceptable. Furthermore, regarding the 48 million Chinese currency of silver stored in the Tianjin concession, this is the property of the Chinese government and should not be transferred to the puppet government, because we cannot recognize it as a legitimate government. In addition, the Japanese government has also demanded that the circulation of legal tender be prohibited in the Tianjin concession and forced people of all kinds to accept the 'worthless paper money' issued by the 'North China United Reserve Bank.' This is the fundamental issue of the Tokyo negotiations. If we refuse to accept these demands, the Japanese side will declare the negotiations broken. But I dare to believe that the government authorities will issue a statement that these demands cannot be accepted, whether before or after seeking the opinions of the countries concerned. If the British government prohibits the circulation of Chinese legal tender in the concessions, it would be tantamount to recognizing the puppet government as a legitimate government, which is contrary to the policy announced by the British government on January 14 of this year, namely, to uphold the Nine-Power Treaty and safeguard China's political, cultural, and economic independence. At this point, the guerrilla tactics adopted by China are the only major factor in the Sino-Japanese war. Regarding the silver issue, Japan's real goal is to eliminate this guerrilla movement, which is just a pretext. If we allow Japan to be satisfied, then Britain's prestige in Asia will be swept away, and the same will be true elsewhere. The best course of action now is to declare that China is part of the peace front. I also ask the government to support Chinese legal tender and declare the abrogation of the Anglo-Japanese commercial treaty. At the same time, I also ask the French government to provide credit loans to China," (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 4th).

### Strength Gradually Exhausted, Japanese Offensive in Taihang Mountains Fails, Chinese Forces Recover Important Towns, Japanese Lines of Communication Severed

(Hong Kong) A telegram from Chongqing reports that the Japanese army launched an offensive in five directions against the Chinese forces' positions in the Taihang Mountains last month, with a fierce momentum. However, the Chinese forces avoided direct confrontation and attacked the weakest points of the Japanese army from the flanks. As a result, the strength of the Japanese army was gradually exhausted, and it has now completely failed. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to launch a counter-offensive and successively recovered more than ten important towns. The Japanese lines of communication have been severed, leaving them isolated and without support, making it even more difficult to supply them. The breaching of the Qinshui River serves as the greatest obstacle to the Japanese army's activities (Special dispatch on the 4th).

(Chongqing) According to news received here, the war in Shanxi has now shifted to southern Shanxi. The Japanese army originally concentrated a large number of troops along the Daoxiao Railway, attempting to advance eastward to Linqi on the border of Shanxi and Henan and to eliminate the Chinese guerrillas in the Taihang Mountains. At present, most of the Japanese army has arrived in Changzhi, taking the road to Lucheng to attack Weizi Town. It is believed that they will join up with another Japanese force advancing from Shicheng to Licheng and Dongyangguan. As for the Japanese army in Dongyuan, southern Henan, they have been forced to retreat towards the Pinghan Railway (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 4th).

### No Trace of Japanese Along Zhongshan Coast

Zhaoqing The Chinese army in Zhongshan, in coordination with local self-defense forces, launched a counter-offensive against the Japanese troops stationed near Hengmen at 6 PM on the 31st, and recovered Hengmen, Dajianshan, Furongshan, Yangtianluo, Boliwei, and other places. The Japanese were forced to return to their ships and fled towards Bao'an. The Japanese troops who had invaded [illegible] were also repulsed by the fierce counterattacks of the Chinese army and retreated at noon on the 1st. There is now no trace of the Japanese along the Zhongshan coast (Dispatch on the 4th).

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, the Chinese army in Zhongshan, Guangdong, has been greatly reinforced and has launched a large-scale counter-offensive against the Japanese troops who landed in Zhongshan last week. As a result, the Japanese troops in that area have retreated to the coast, and the Japanese warships that had previously covered the landing of the Japanese troops have also departed. Although the blockade of Hengmen has been broken by the Japanese, the position of the Chinese army has been greatly strengthened after moving into new positions, which is sufficient to prevent the Japanese army from continuing to advance (Associated Press dispatch on the 4th).

### Henan Battles, Chinese Forces Highly Successful, Japanese Troops in Wanhedian Abandon Corpses and Retreat, Chinese Forces in Hubei Attacking Qianjiang

(Chongqing) According to today's Chinese military news, the Chinese forces have been highly successful in the battles in southern Henan. The Japanese troops in Wanhedian abandoned seventy corpses on the battlefield and retreated in haste. Their panic and haste were far from their former discipline. On the west bank of the Hanshui River in central Hubei, the Chinese army is constantly attacking Qianjiang. The Japanese troops in Qianjiang are now destroying the roads around the suburbs in an attempt to hinder the Chinese offensive. In northern Hunan, the Chinese army is pursuing the Japanese army to the Taolin area. In eastern Hubei, the Chinese army has also achieved considerable victories. Hexingdian (transliteration) and Wulidian have been occupied by the Chinese army. However, after occupying Wulidian, the Chinese army set fire to the Japanese camp and its warehouse and then withdrew. According to news from Jiangxi, seven Japanese gunboats patrolling along the Gan River struck Chinese mines. Five Japanese boats were sunk, and more than 100 Japanese soldiers were drowned. A certain puppet county magistrate also died at the same time (Associated Press dispatch on the 4th).

(Changsha) The Japanese troops facing the lines of northern Hunan, southern Hubei, and northern Jiangxi are now making every effort to restore the lines of communication in their rear that have been destroyed by the Chinese forces. The front lines are all quiet, with no fighting (Dispatch on the 4th).

### Japanese Side Denies Withdrawal of Troops from Central China

(Tokyo) Today, the Japanese military spokesman here has solemnly denied the rumors that a large number of Japanese troops have been withdrawn from Central China, and said that the blockade of South China and Central China has actually been tightened (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd).

### Japanese Warships Bombard Xiepu Waters

Jinhua At 2 PM on the 3rd, three Japanese warships arrived in the waters off Ligang and launched speedboats to patrol. At 4 PM, one of them opened fire on the shore at Xiepu (under the jurisdiction of Yuyao), firing more than ten shells. At 11 PM, it fired another nine shells at the shore. All the shells landed on the beach, causing no damage (Dispatch on the 4th).

### Japanese Planes Raid Gan, Xiang and Gui Also Bombed

Ji'an At 6:10 AM on the 3rd, three Japanese planes passed through Jinxian to Yingtan and dropped several bombs, destroying several houses and injuring two people. At 7:12 AM, another three Japanese planes passed through Fengcheng and Zhangshu and flew south. They then turned back to reconnoiter in the Zhangshu and Fengcheng area and then fled towards northern Jiangxi (Dispatch on the 3rd).

Zhaoqing On the morning of the 1st, four Japanese planes flew to Dianbai and Meilu and bombed them, dropping many bombs, destroying more than ten houses and killing and injuring more than twenty civilians (Dispatch on the 4th).

Guilin Eighteen Japanese planes attacked today in two batches, destroying dozens of civilian houses (Dispatch on the 4th).

(Changsha) Three Japanese planes flew from Jiangxi to the airspace over Zhuzhou at 7:55 AM on the 4th, dropping more than ten bombs in the suburbs of the city, destroying several civilian houses and injuring one civilian. They then detoured through Youxian and fled to the northeast (Dispatch on the 4th).

Guiyang Feng Yong arrived in Guiyang from Yunnan today and then transferred to Chongqing (Dispatch on the 4th).

### Amidst Anti-British Movement, New Atrocities in Tianjin, Missionaries in Various Places Mostly Forced to Retreat, Japanese Consul in Tianjin Bans Publication of Anti-British News, U.S. Side Issues Strongly Worded Note

(Tianjin) Today, a group of Chinese anti-British rioters, instigated by the Japanese, broke into the International Trading Company, which is run by the British, and destroyed all the glass windows and furniture. Many of the valuable equipment was thrown into the Hai River. The British staff of the company, seeing that the situation was not good, fled to the nearby Texaco Company, which is run by Americans, and were unharmed. The British merchants here who have offices and factories here have expressed their worries (Associated Press dispatch on the 4th).

(Beiping) Since the outbreak of anti-British movements in various parts of North China, seventy Britons, mostly missionaries, have voluntarily or been forced to retreat from various places. Three family members of missionary James Ning in Linfen, Shanxi, were evacuated at the end of June because rioters broke into their house and destroyed their property. Four missionaries from Xihongdong were forced to leave the country because rioters used the same methods. Ten Britons evacuated from Xianfeng. Three Britons and one Danish woman were forced to go from Xi'an to Bian. British Baptist missionaries Mr. and Mrs. Smith voluntarily left Qin County, Shanxi, and returned to Beiping via Taiyuan. They claimed that fourteen British Baptist missionaries and two British Salvation Army members were warned to leave the country as soon as possible. Sixteen people were counted from Taiyuan to Shijiazhuang, but no news has been received from Shijiazhuang. They may have been blocked by railway damage, or have returned to Taiyuan, or have gone north from Taiyuan to Datong in northern Shanxi. Eight Canadian missionaries in Anyang (Zhangde) in northern Henan, because of the intense anti-British movement there, all the servants they hired have resigned. Ms. London Chipley died of typhoid fever during the riots. Six Canadian missionaries in Beiping intend to return to their original residence. Twenty to thirty Britons in Jinan were warned to leave the country within two weeks. Two weeks have passed, but no news has been received as to whether they have left the country. The Kaifeng Anti-British Committee decided to continue the anti-British movement. The Beiping Anti-British Committee, "in order to expand anti-British propaganda and to draw the attention of residents," erected an electric light slogan "Down with the British" on the drum tower on Tiananmen Square near the Forbidden City. The Catholic Church in Guilin County, Guangxi, was bombed to the ground by Japanese planes on July 31 (Associated Press dispatch on the 4th).

Changde Front line reports that the Yueyang Gospel Church has recently been dismantled by the Japanese, and all British and American missionaries have been expelled. The oil towers of the Mobil Oil Company in Chenglingji have also been destroyed, and the employees of the company have all fled (Dispatch on the 4th).

(Hankou) According to news here today, the American Consul General here has handed a strongly worded note to the Japanese Consul General here, asking the Japanese side to take full responsibility for protecting the lives and property of Americans in Kaifeng, Henan. The reason for the American Consul's note is that the anti-British movement in Kaifeng has a strong tendency to become a general anti-foreign movement. Therefore, the Japanese side must be made to prevent the anti-British movement from turning into an anti-American movement. The American side also protested against the occupation of the Mobil Oil Depot in Chenglingji by the Japanese army on July 1. The Japanese side has promised to investigate. According to the American side, when the Japanese army occupied the Mobil Oil Depot in Chenglingji, they tore down and destroyed the American flag and completely expelled the Chinese staff (Associated Press dispatch on the 4th).

(Tianjin) A Haitong News Agency reporter learned from reliable sources that the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin has recently notified Chinese newspapers to stop publishing news of the anti-British movement from tomorrow (Haitong dispatch on the 4th).

(Beiping) According to American tourists who arrived in Beiping, the Japanese organized an anti-British committee in Taiyuan and expelled the sixteen British Baptist missionaries there. It was said that one evening, while the church was holding Sunday service, three trucks filled with anti-British vigilantes arrived and surrounded the church. After the service was over, all 150 Chinese people gathered in the church were arrested and imprisoned. Women and children were released three days later. The Anti-British Committee told the missionaries that if they did not leave Taiyuan, all the Chinese in the church would face ominous fates or even be executed. In order to protect the lives of the Chinese and avoid being tortured, the missionaries agreed to leave and closed the church and hospital. The missionaries are now stranded in Shijiazhuang due to flooding and must wait for the water to recede before they can continue their journey (Reuters dispatch on the 4th).

### Situation in Tianjin Concessions Still Not Improving, Suburbs Flooded, Prices Soaring

(Tianjin) This morning, the food situation in the British Concession has not improved. The stalls in the vegetable market are all empty. The vegetable market in the French Concession is fortunate to have been provided with some supplies through the efforts of the French authorities, but this is only enough to meet the needs of the French Concession (Reuters dispatch on the 4th).

(Tianjin) A few days ago, the Hai River was very crowded. Large and small ships were parked from Special District 1 to the International Bridge. Now it is unusually deserted. Only a few barges and tugboats are occasionally seen sailing in it. According to a Reuters investigation, it was learned that the various shipping companies have decided that all ships will stop in Tanggu and no longer sail upstream because the high water level makes it extremely dangerous for the ships to turn around. A Reuters reporter personally saw a small Japanese ship turning around on the Bund outside the British Concession this morning. Because the river was turbulent, it almost had an accident. It was only after proper handling that it was able to get out of danger and sail downstream. Although the river water has not continued to rise, some low-lying areas in Special District 2 have become swamps (Reuters dispatch on the 4th).

(Beiping) Because the roads outside the city and the suburbs are still submerged in floods, the prices of various foods are continuing to rise, especially vegetables. Most people here believe that if the roads in the suburbs are not repaired early, prices will break all previous records. At the same time, there is a great shortage of pork here. Restaurants and hotels have removed dishes that use pork from the menu. Chinese newspapers here have expressed great concern about this. It is said that the reason for the shortage of pork is that Tongzhou, the area where pigs are produced, is still flooded, and new goods cannot be leveled. At the same time, most of the goods here have been transported to Tianjin, so this situation has been formed. The price of pork here has increased from 34 cents a catty to 1.20 yuan a catty and continues to rise. Unscrupulous merchants are also hoarding other goods. Although the rain has stopped in various parts of Hebei, the rivers are still flooding. From Beiping south to Baoding, all are flooded. British missionaries who were forced to come to Beiping from Shanxi and Henan have not been able to arrive here today due to railway traffic disruptions (Associated Press dispatch on the 4th).

(Tianjin) This morning, a Chinese policeman reported to the British Engineering Bureau that he had seen a car with several people inside, possibly Chinese, driving straight into the Hai River when he was on duty on the Bund outside the British Concession this morning. When he was about to go forward to inquire, the car disappeared. Judging from the tire tracks on the Bund, it is likely that the car has fallen into the river. He immediately began to salvage it and the police sent people to investigate the truth about the car and the passengers. This afternoon, the car was found in the river and has been salvaged to the shore, but there was no one in the car. The car door was locked, and the doors and windows were smashed. It has now been determined that the car belongs to a Chinese man. It is said that his son and a girlfriend are now missing (Reuters dispatch on the 4th).

Several "checkpoint houses" have machine guns installed. A large number of tanks were moved into Slovakia at night, and many flat-trajectory guns were seen. In the next few days, 50,000 Czech workers will be sent to East Prussia to build fortifications. It is heard that 50,000 people have been hired in that area and Danzig to do the same work (Reuters dispatch on the 4th).

(London) A Warsaw dispatch from the News Chronicle says that according to reliable sources, German troops are currently concentrated in the western border area of Poland, and it is believed that there are 150,000 to 160,000 of them. A large contingent of German troops with long-range artillery is stationed in Stolp, German Pomerania, opposite Danzig (Reuters dispatch on the 4th).

(London) When the House of Commons met this morning, Conservative MP Adams and Opposition Labour MP Henderson both raised questions about the situation in the Free City of Danzig. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler immediately replied, "The Free City has been intensifying military and semi-military activities for several weeks. Prime Minister Chamberlain issued a statement on the 31st of last month, saying that the British government is closely monitoring the situation and is closely exchanging views with the Polish government" (Havas News Agency dispatch on the 4th).

Warsaw News has been received here from the Free City of Danzig, stating that the city is still actively making military preparations, as can be seen from the following facts: (1) The German Air Force of the city is scheduled to hold exercises at Lanfu Airport on the evening of the 4th of this month. (2) Members of military groups in the city must pledge to serve the authorities of the city until the Free City of Danzig is merged into Germany. (3) Defensive fortifications are being built in various military strongholds, such as Pischofsburg and Hagersburg, and artillery positions have been installed. (4) The pontoon bridge on the Vistula River, which is the pontoon bridge connecting the city to the province of East Prussia, will be completed within days. (5) The roads leading directly to the border of East Prussia have been closed to traffic in order to build defensive fortifications along the road, and the road surface has been thickened to allow military trucks and heavy artillery to pass through. (6) National Socialist Party leader Fuster inspected the defensive fortifications on the Polish border yesterday and toured the Maxko area, the military center of Danzig. It is said that the Danzig army will concentrate in that area in the future (Havas dispatch on the 3rd).

Bucharest, Romania Hundreds of thousands of people are now enlisting because they have received notices to participate in the grand maneuvers. The date of the grand maneuvers will occupy most of August. The general public was somewhat alarmed after hearing this news on the radio, as the grand maneuvers are usually held in the autumn, but they soon calmed down. A total of 350,000 people have been called up this time, and the total number of those who have already enlisted is 500,000. It has been decided that the grand maneuvers will be held in three areas: (1) near the western border; (2) near the southern border; (3) Bessarabia. It is said that the soldiers who are drilling there will spend part of their time repairing roads and other transportation (Reuters dispatch on the 4th).

Bazine City, southern France Guests from Spain say that the Spanish authorities are making large-scale military preparations on the border between France and Spain. 5,000 specialized workers have been hired to rush to build defensive fortifications, and several military roads are being built.

Madrid According to reliable sources, the British authorities have ordered the relocation of factories and shops on the western edge of Gibraltar in preparation for the construction of military projects there. The western edge of Gibraltar is across the bay from Algeciras, Spain.

### German-Chinese Bank Holds Annual Meeting, Expresses Concern Over Japan's Monopoly on Far East Trade

(Berlin) The shareholders' meeting of the German-Chinese Bank in Shanghai was held here yesterday for its annual general meeting. The settlement of accounts for 1938 was approved, and it was decided to distribute a dividend of fifteen marks per share, compared to twenty-five marks per share in the previous year. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)

(Berlin) At today's annual meeting of the German-Chinese Bank held here, Chairman Ubig delivered a speech, stating that China is currently in a state of obvious chaos. The lower reaches of the rivers where the major commercial cities are located have mostly been occupied by Japanese troops, so the minimal amount of export trade is not even worth mentioning. The complexity of the currency is also a reason for the decline in trade. He hopes that the currency issue, like that between Britain and Japan, can be resolved satisfactorily. We have done our best to protect the interests of the bank, but the future is difficult to predict. (Reuters, 3rd)

### Anglo-Franco-Soviet Military Talks: Soviet Representatives Appointed, Including Voroshilov and Four Others; Britain to Define "Indirect Aggression"

(Moscow) The Anglo-French military delegation is expected to arrive here on August 11th. The Soviet government has appointed Army Commissar Voroshilov, Navy Commissar Kuznetsov, Chief of Staff Shaposhnikov, Air Force Chief of Staff Loktionov, and Deputy Chief of Staff Smorodinov as Soviet representatives. All of these individuals hold positions just below the highest authorities of the defense organization, so it is widely expected that the future negotiations will be extremely important. (Reuters, 4th)

(Paris) The staff officers from Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will soon hold talks in Moscow. The French military delegation, led by General Doumenc, the commander of the Lille garrison, departed this morning for London to meet with the British military delegation, and will then travel together to Moscow tomorrow. (Havas, 4th)

(London) Regarding the staff talks between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the British and French military delegations are scheduled to depart from Tilbury, England, at 4:00 PM on the 5th of this month, arriving in Leningrad in approximately nine days. This military delegation consists of seventeen staff officers from the army, navy, and air force, all of whom are familiar with foreign armies and proficient in French and Russian. The duration of their stay in Moscow is yet to be determined. The British side believes that five or six weeks are needed, but the Soviet side stated that the presence of the British and French military delegations in Moscow should be of a semi-permanent nature in order to facilitate close cooperation between the staff departments of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. This is necessary even after the dangerous period of August and September has passed. In any case, the mission of the British and French military delegations is not only to conclude a military agreement with the Soviet Union, but also to determine the methods of contact between the three countries' armies. (Havas, 3rd)

(London) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, it is reported that persons close to the government have stated that the Foreign Office will shortly send a new directive by telegram to Sir Seeds, the British ambassador to the Soviet Union, instructing him to make a final effort to reach a compromise on the issue of "indirect aggression," so that the tripartite political agreement can be concluded before the staff officers of Britain and France arrive in Moscow. It is rumored that the content of the new directive divides "indirect aggression" into two types: (1) If military preparations against the Soviet Union are carried out in the territory of a third country, then Britain and France need not exchange opinions with the Soviet Union and should immediately provide assistance to the Soviet Union. Any construction of defenses, military roads, highways or railways, emplacement of artillery positions, construction of military airfields, or concentration of troops in a third country can be regarded as military preparations against the Soviet Union. (2) If individuals with obvious leanings towards National Socialism join the government of a third country, then Britain, France, and the Soviet Union may, at the suggestion of the Soviet Union, exchange opinions and plan a response. (Havas, 3rd)

(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax, in a speech delivered in the House of Lords this afternoon, addressed the general international situation and the progress of the Moscow negotiations in the final section. He said, "The task of drafting a diplomatic document that takes into account all kinds of situations is extremely complex, and differences of opinion are inevitable as a result. This is why Britain, France, and the Soviet Union have not yet reached a compromise on the definition of indirect aggression. "Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are all seeking a way to take into account all kinds of indirect aggression without hindering the independence or neutrality of third countries, and consultations are still underway." It is said that it is unnecessary for the British government to send cabinet members to Moscow because Britain's sincerity in establishing a political agreement is evident from the fact that the staff officers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are about to begin talks. Regarding the issue of the Free City of Danzig, the Foreign Secretary stated briefly that the government is paying close attention to the developments. Britain's position has already been explained to the House of Commons by Prime Minister Chamberlain on July 10th. (The Prime Minister stated briefly that if any party attempts to unilaterally change the existing system of Danzig, then the survival and independence of the Polish nation would be affected, and it would not be regarded as a local event. Britain has provided Poland with guarantees, and once that country considers that its vital interests are threatened, then the guarantee measures should be implemented.) "In short, we have done our best to organize the forces of peace and prevent war. At this moment, we must remain calm and united, not overemphasize any rumors, and be neither overly optimistic nor overly pessimistic. That is the proper course of action." (Havas, 3rd)

### Japanese Five-Minister Conference Discusses Countermeasures to the Current Situation; Shiratori and Oshima Suggest Government Urge Participation in German-Italian Alliance

(Tokyo) The Japanese government convened a five-minister conference at the Prime Minister's official residence from 1:00 PM today. Those in attendance included Prime Minister Hiranuma, Navy Minister Yonai, Foreign Minister Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and Finance Minister Hyakuta. After the Army Minister reported on the general situation in China, they also discussed the handling of the Incident and other matters. The meeting adjourned at 2:00 PM. (Domei, 4th)

(Rome) After a meeting held yesterday by Japanese Ambassador to Italy Toshio Shiratori and Japanese Ambassador to Germany General Oshima at Villa d'Este on Lake Como, it is reported that they have telegraphed their government, requesting to join the German-Italian political and military alliance treaty. (Havas, 4th)

(Tokyo) According to political figures here, as a result of a meeting held yesterday by Japanese Chief of Staff Prince Kan'in, Army Minister Itagaki, and Inspector General of Military Education Nishio, it was decided to recommend to the government that it strengthen its ties with the Axis powers of Germany and Italy. It is widely expected that the form of the so-called enhanced relationship will be a military agreement. Before the meeting, Army Minister Itagaki had first convened a meeting of the bureau chiefs of the Ministry of the Army and the Chief of the Army General Staff, and reported on the recent developments in Japan's relations with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Colonel Mutō, the Japanese military expert who participated in the Anglo-Japanese talks, stood up and stated that Britain was attempting to discuss political issues and economic matters separately, but in reality, they should not be separated and should be discussed comprehensively in terms of Japan's overall national security. Political figures believe that the reason why Japanese military personnel have proposed strengthening relations with Germany and Italy is to respond to the strengthening of Britain's attitude in the Tokyo negotiations and the announcement by the United States of the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. (Haitong Telegraph, 4th)

(Rome) Japanese Ambassador to Italy Toshio Shiratori and Japanese Ambassador to Germany General Ōshima, along with several subordinates including military attaches, recently arrived in Villa d'Este on Lake Como, where they immediately held a meeting to discuss the strengthening of the Anti-Comintern Pact. The meeting lasted for three hours. Afterwards, they issued a statement, stating briefly that what was discussed was the issue of close cooperation between Japan and the Axis powers in current policies. "The fact that we chose Villa d'Este, having previously held talks in Rome and Berlin, is not a coincidence. This is a good sign, because the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy once held a meeting and signed an agreement in the same place, strengthening the powers of two countries that maintain friendly relations and promoting prosperity. These two countries certainly maintain friendly relations with Japan." The ambassadors will stay in Villa d'Este for a short period, returning to their posts at the end of this week. (Havas, 3rd)

(Rome) After the Japanese ambassadors to Italy and Germany held a meeting and issued a statement on Lake Como yesterday, political observers here generally regard Japan's joining the German-Italian military alliance as a question. Most of them also said that, "Since the military attaches of the Japanese embassies in Germany and Italy have already participated in the meeting, the country will definitely join this alliance. The statement issued by the ambassadors mentioned the talks held by the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy in May of this year (the two countries subsequently signed a military alliance treaty), which shows that it is of significance. Former Japanese Army Minister General Terauchi and former Navy Minister Admiral Osumi are about to lead a delegation to Germany and Italy for visits, which is also extremely important." In addition, some observers said, "Japan may not join this alliance. The meeting held by the Japanese ambassadors to Germany and Italy is purely a diplomatic tactic, and its targets are none other than the negotiations being conducted between Britain and Japan in Tokyo, the negotiations being conducted between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Moscow, and the U.S. government's abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. The ambassadors' statement is also intended to warn Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union that whether Japan joins the German-Italian military alliance depends on whether Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are hostile to the expansionist policies that the country is pursuing in China. Since the United States abrogated the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, Britain's attitude has become stronger, and Japan has openly expressed its solidarity with the Rome-Berlin axis."

### U.S. Treasury Secretary Tours Europe; Undersecretary Acts as Department Head

### Panama Canal: Additional Funding for Lock Construction

Approved by U.S. Congress

(Washington) The Army Department previously submitted a bill to Congress, proposing to add several locks to the Panama Canal with $277,000,000. It has been passed by the House of Representatives, and now it has been unanimously approved by the Senate. This case has now been established, but the Army Department still expresses hope that Congress will approve an appropriation of $15 million before the recess in order to start construction immediately as a means of strengthening defense.

### Japanese Aircraft Continually Invade Chongqing: Air Raid Again Last Morning Under Moonlight; All Consulates Affected; Fierce Air Battles Occurred; Rumors of Two Japanese Aircraft Shot Down

(Chongqing) On the morning of the 4th, two groups of Japanese aircraft, a total of 18 planes, attacked Chongqing again by moonlight. The first group of nine aircraft dropped bombs on the eastern suburbs of the city and escaped after being heavily fired upon by Chinese anti-aircraft guns. The second group of nine aircraft also attacked near the city suburbs. The Chinese air force launched a fierce attack on them. A portion of the Japanese aircraft invaded the city's airspace, and Chinese aircraft pursued them again. The Japanese aircraft dropped many incendiary and explosive bombs in the city suburbs and fled eastward. After investigation, one place caught fire after being hit. Liu Zhi personally went to inspect the disaster situation. Fortunately, the fire brigade's rescue was effective, and the fire did not spread. (Telegraph, 4th)

(Chongqing) The capital of the Chinese government, Chongqing, was bombed again last night by Japanese aircraft. Twenty-seven Japanese aircraft attacked in formation. Chinese aircraft took off to engage them, resulting in one Japanese aircraft being shot down. The Japanese aircraft dropped many bombs, causing a raging fire. The extent of the damage is under investigation. (Haitong News Agency, 4th)

(Chongqing) Last night, Japanese planes bombed Chongqing twice. The British and French consulates and the German embassy were severely damaged. The residences of American journalists were also affected. Twenty foreigners, including senior consulate officials, narrowly escaped death when three bombs exploded in the consulate area. When a house between the British and French consulates was hit by a Japanese bomb, four Chinese were killed instantly. When another bomb exploded outside the German consulate, three Chinese were killed. The windows of the British and French consulates were damaged, and plaster fell from the walls. The German embassy was severely damaged. The British Chargé d'Affaires and the Deputy Consul in Chongqing narrowly escaped death when Japanese bombs exploded within 100 yards of their air-raid shelters. British female visitor Bainfair took refuge in the air-raid shelter of the British consulate and escaped injury. Another bomb exploded 300 yards from the French consulate, but French Consul Midart was not injured. The residence of the New York Times reporter and former editor of the Shanghai Continental Daily, Durdin, was completely destroyed by a 200-pound bomb. Durdin and his wife, as well as their friend Mr. Snow (famous for his writings on the Red Army), all escaped. Fires broke out in houses near the British and French consulates and the German embassy. Japanese aircraft bombs also fell on the south bank of the Yangtze River and the western suburbs of Chongqing. Although there were few casualties in the city, officials believe that, since the people have evacuated Chongqing city, many refugees have gathered in the four suburbs of Chongqing city, and the casualties there must be high. Last night's Japanese attack on Chongqing was the first recorded instance of Chongqing being bombed three times in one week since the Sino-Japanese War. Chinese fighter planes drove away the first wave of Japanese bombers, but the second wave of Japanese bombers invaded from the western district. Chinese fighter planes and Japanese bombers engaged in the most spectacular and fierce air battle since June 25th. According to reliable sources, at least one Japanese aircraft was shot down by the Chinese army. Although the number of Chinese fighter planes participating in the battle was small, they fought bravely, firing fiercely at the Japanese aircraft with machine guns around them. (Associated Press, 4th)

(Chongqing) According to the military authorities here today, Chongqing's night-time air defense system is considered to be sound. This point can be proven by the results of the recent nightly attacks by Japanese aircraft. The efficiency of the searchlight team is particularly admirable, because they can not only discover the location of Japanese aircraft when they appear in the sky, but also follow the Japanese aircraft with their light, not relaxing in the slightest, so that the Japanese aircraft have nowhere to hide, and the anti-aircraft gun team can fully exert its power. The efficiency of the fire brigade and ambulance team has also greatly improved. Therefore, after the recent Japanese aircraft bombings, although fires still broke out, they were extinguished by the Chinese fire brigade within half an hour. As for the transportation of the wounded to hospitals for treatment and the clearing of the dead, they can also be completed separately before the alarm is lifted. (Associated Press, 4th)

(Chongqing) This morning, Japanese aircraft again came to Chongqing to attack. The British Consul's residence suffered minor damage. Staff member Ponsted and Acting Consul Mackenzie were both in the residence, but escaped injury. The residence of the French Consulate's medical officer and the German Consulate were completely destroyed. The residence of the New York Times reporter Mr. and Mrs. Baudendistel was also destroyed, but fortunately the two took shelter in a nearby cellar and escaped disaster. The French Consulate's medical officer's residence was only eight yards away from the British Consul's residence and was completely destroyed by a bomb. Shortly after midnight, Japanese bombers attempted to break through the Chinese fighter plane formation circling in the city's airspace. They tried their best to find opportunities to evade the Chinese fighter planes. The fighter planes repelled the Japanese aircraft twice in the sky over the suburbs. At 2:30 AM, several Japanese aircraft finally entered the city limits. Chinese aircraft pursued them closely, but the Japanese aircraft dived downward in an attempt to increase speed, flying quickly through the city and suddenly dropping bombs in the upper city area near the foreign consulates. Several fires broke out, which were extinguished one after another. The last fire was extinguished at dawn. After the alarm was lifted at 3:30 AM, the Reuters reporter went to observe the bombed area. Traffic between the western suburbs of the city and the bombed area in the upper city was blocked due to fires on the main streets. The fire brigade worked bravely. The reporter saw several people risk climbing the roofs of buildings close to the flames to pull down nearby houses in order to inject water hoses into the fire. Around the fire scene, ambulance teams applied initial dressings to the injured before carrying them away. Police Commander Liu Zhi personally directed the rescue work. According to a communiqué issued by the authorities, eighteen Japanese bombers attacked Chongqing in two groups this morning. The first group of nine aircraft bombed the commercial airfield below Chongqing city. A portion of the second group bombed the upper city area. It is reported that several Japanese aircraft also bombed Central University, which is located ten miles west of Chongqing, but this information has not yet been verified. The anti-aircraft guns did not fire this morning so that the Chinese fighter planes could fight the Japanese aircraft in the sky. According to eyewitnesses, at least two Japanese bombers were shot down in the air battle. One exploded and fell in the sky, and the other crashed in Nanzhuang, southwest of Chongqing. It is reported that many people were killed or injured in Wenquan, south of the Yangtze River, because residents believed that the area was safe and did not take precautions. No foreigners were killed or injured. (Reuters, 4th)

### A Small Leopard in the Air-Raid Shelter

(Chongqing) When Japanese aircraft bombed here at 2:10 AM and 2:50 AM this morning, the Chinese people sheltering in the air-raid shelter of the Canadian church were quite threatened by a small leopard brought from Chengdu by Professor Campbell of West China University. This small leopard, which is native to western Sichuan and is only four months old, also showed signs of panic during the Japanese aircraft bombing. As a result, it bared its teeth and claws and rushed back and forth in the crowd, almost causing the Chinese people in the air-raid shelter to forget the terror of the Japanese aircraft and only pay attention to this small leopard. It is reported that Professor Campbell has now obtained permission from the Chinese government to transport this leopard to the United States. (Associated Press, 4th)

### Zhejiang Province's Educational Expenses for the 28th Year Approved by the Executive Yuan: More Than 2.59 Million Yuan for Regular and Temporary Expenditures, an Increase of More Than 780,000 Yuan Compared to Last Year

(Lishui Correspondence) Since the outbreak of the war two years ago, the Zhejiang provincial educational authorities have stepped up their guidance, and wartime education work has been quite active. Its work progress has been commended by the Ministry of Education, which has allowed it to promote compulsory education and find ways to relieve students who have lost their schooling and employment, with even more significant results. Chairman Huang Shaohong regards wartime education as an urgent task at the moment, so in order to continue to enhance the effectiveness of education work, the educational expenses for the 28th year should be specially increased, and social public righteous education should be universally promoted in order to enhance the wartime public power. It is learned that the newly revised general budget of educational and cultural expenses for the 28th year has been transferred by the provincial government to the regular meeting of the Central Executive Yuan in Chongqing for discussion and approval. It is estimated that the regular expenses will be 2,484,677 yuan, the temporary expenses will be 113,900 yuan, and the total will be 2,598,577 yuan, which is an increase of 781,875 yuan compared to the 1,816,702 yuan in the 27th year.

### Chief of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, Chen Dongyuan, Discusses How to Choose Departments and Schools (Part 5)

Two Standards for Choosing a School: The School Itself and Personal Convenience

School Standards

Choosing a school should not be based solely on the school's reputation. The first section already discussed this, because the reputation of a school, which is often highly regarded, is often insufficient to represent the true quality of the school, let alone to indicate whether it suits your needs. So how should you choose a school? I think there are two standards:

(1) The standard of the school itself. Each school has its own advantages. It is absolutely impossible for everything to be good. Therefore, when choosing a school, you should see which departments are good. The way to see is nothing more than several aspects: 1. Equipment, 2. Talent, 3. Student atmosphere, 4. Performance of graduates in society. Within a school, some departments may have good standards, while others may not. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, it is a pity that there is still no special book describing the situation of various departments in universities across the country for young people to refer to when applying to schools. However, based on my personal knowledge and experience, I might as well mention a few examples. For example, the Faculty of Arts is excellent at Southwest Associated University, Sun Yat-sen University, and Zhejiang University. The Faculty of Science is excellent at National Central University, Southwest Associated University, and Yenching University. The Faculty of Law is excellent at Wuhan University, National Central University, and Soochow University. The Faculty of Agriculture is excellent at National Central University, Private University of Nanking, and Lingnan University. The Faculty of Engineering is excellent at Tangshan Engineering College, Wuhan University, and National Central University. The Faculty of Commerce is excellent at Private Fudan University and Shanghai College of Commerce. The Faculty of Medicine is excellent at National Central University, Tongji University, and Northwest United University. The Teachers College is excellent at National Teachers College, National Central University, Zhejiang University, Northwest United University, and Sun Yat-sen University.  The Department of Management is excellent at National Chiao Tung University. All of the above examples inevitably have omissions. However, they are just examples. In detail, each department within each faculty has its own advantages and disadvantages due to the differences in faculty and talent. In short, when you choose a school, you should observe the equipment, faculty and talent, student atmosphere, and the contribution of graduates to society in various departments in order to obtain a more reliable standard.

(2) The standard of personal convenience. As mentioned earlier, each school has its advantages. Therefore, when choosing a school, we cannot only use the advantages and disadvantages of the school itself as a standard. Whether the school is convenient for the individual is also an important condition. For example, 1. Is the area where the school is located too far from home? 2. Can my personal financial ability afford the fees required by the school? 3. Do I have other relationships with the school, such as my father or brother working at the school, or friends and teachers who graduated from the school? These are all issues worth considering. Especially at present, when transportation is difficult, if the school you enter is too far from where you live, it will be quite difficult to get to the school after being admitted, so you should pay more attention to the area where the school is located. This year's unified enrollment requires filling in three choices when registering. The Ministry of Education has promulgated four principles for distribution after passing the examination and being admitted. The first article says, "Admitted freshmen will be distributed according to their first choice, regardless of the examination area, and in order of academic performance." According to this article, you can fill in your ideal school and department that you have chosen as your first choice. Then, whoever has better test scores can be assigned to the school they have chosen, which completely depends on academic performance. Candidates from Guangdong can be assigned to Shaanxi, and candidates from Chongqing can be assigned to Kunming. This is also the intention of unified enrollment. The second article says, "When the school of the first choice is full, the departments of the second and third choices will be assigned to colleges and universities in the examination area or nearby areas, still in order of academic performance." According to this article, when you fill in the second and third choices, you should focus on the departments that match your personal choices. As for the schools you fill in, you might as well fill in the schools in the examination area or nearby areas, because if you cannot be admitted according to your first choice in the future, you can only be assigned to the examination area or nearby areas. This matter is related to the actual application during registration, so it is specifically attached for discussion.  (End)

### YMCA Subsidizes Students' Finances

Registration starts from the 7th to the 12th

The Shanghai YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge and the YWCA at Jing'an Temple Road, in view of the fact that outstanding middle and high school students in this city are unable to continue their studies due to war damage, and have dropped out of school halfway, which is a pity, have organized a student relief committee to consider the situation and subsidize tuition fees, or living expenses, or travel expenses, so that they can continue their studies. The qualifications are limited to students in schools above the junior college level and senior high school students, regardless of religion or gender. The subsidy for university students will not exceed 50 yuan in national currency per person, and the subsidy for middle school students will not exceed 30 yuan per person. The application method is that the applicant fills out an application form to the association and submits it together with the required documents. Then the association will carefully check the items filled in. On the one hand, in order to encourage students to pay attention to common sense and current affairs, all applicants must be given a common sense and current affairs test by the association. After the association deems it qualified, it will issue a notice of payment. The registration date has been set for August 7th to 12th, from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm, and from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, at the student department of the two associations, which is truly good news for poor students.

### Education Community Prepares to Celebrate the First Teachers' Day

The Ministry of Education has issued an order to schools in various places, stipulating that Confucius' birthday on August 27th every year is Teachers' Day, both to commend the sage's virtues and to inspire the masses. The education community in this city, in view of the upcoming first Teachers' Day, in order to commemorate and celebrate it, plans to convene various educational groups and schools within days to discuss the celebration methods. It is heard that the notices have been issued separately.

### School News Roundup

Jianxing University: Jianxing University in this city has always been committed to helping students who have dropped out of school. It was jointly established by the education, finance, and charity sectors for two years.

### Shanghai Public Organizations Clarify Their Position in Telegrams to British and American Authorities - Telegrams to Roosevelt Urge Continued Sanctions Against Aggression - Urge British Prime Minister to Take Effective Action

Yesterday, major public organizations in Shanghai sent telegrams to US President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and British Prime Minister Chamberlain, expressing their respect for the US abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, the British declaration of no change in its policy towards China, and the British-Japanese Tokyo negotiations, and explaining China's solemn position, requesting that effective methods be taken to sanction aggression. The original telegrams are translated below:

Telegrams to the US President Express Respect

To President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull in Washington: We are deeply impressed by your resolute abolition of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which shows the demeanor and sincerity of great statesmen upholding justice. This move will not only safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of the United States, but also make a significant contribution to the restoration of the international rule of law and moral order. Our 450 million people all look forward to your continued leadership in sanctioning aggressors by the most effective means, so that humanitarianism and world justice can be promoted. We are infinitely hopeful.

Anglo-Japanese Negotiations Call for Suspension

To Prime Minister Chamberlain in London: The people of our country have learned that Your Excellency declared in Congress a few days ago that there would be no change in the policy towards China. We deeply admire this and send a telegram to reaffirm our confidence in Your Excellency's leadership of world politics and continued assistance to our country. The policy of appeasement in the Far East can only succeed if it actively confronts aggression with a fixed and strong policy and jointly takes necessary actions with all democratic countries related to the Far East. Therefore, we respectfully request that you immediately suspend the Tokyo negotiations and sincerely use the most effective methods, such as abolishing the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce and Navigation and prohibiting the export of military materials to Japan, to sanction aggressors, so that Britain's Far Eastern interests can be maintained and world peace and international justice can be restored. We are infinitely hopeful.

### Extension of the Western Section of the Longhai Railway

### Terrorists Released by Italian Army - Found to be "Avenue" Employees - Often Handed Over to the Japanese Authorities

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reports that the armed terrorists who caused a great disturbance at Cao Yi Elementary School at No. 1081 Jiesfeier Road yesterday (3rd) morning were released by the Italian army to the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters in the afternoon and immediately returned to Cao Yi Elementary School, expelled the faculty and staff, and occupied the building that was once the headquarters of the Caojiadu Security Corps. It is believed that these terrorists are members of the so-called "Chinese Nationalist Party Anti-Communist Special Agent Group" organized by the Wang faction. It is heard that these people intend to turn the house into another agency. After the terrorists were released by the Japanese Gendarmerie Headquarters yesterday afternoon, ten of them, each with a hand grenade and a military Mauser pistol, but no longer holding large knives, returned to Cao Yi Elementary School, which caused the faculty and staff to immediately withdraw and then occupied it. Occasionally, one or two people patrol outside, but they are no longer interfered with by Italian patrol soldiers. According to official sources, 16 terrorists were disarmed and taken to the Italian military headquarters yesterday morning, and then handed over to the Japanese authorities because they were employees of the "Avenue" and were arrested in the Japanese-controlled area.

### Preparing for the Anniversary of the Shanghai War and Defense - Police Conduct Alarm Drills - Two Alarms Issued in Less Than an Hour - All Detectives and Police Officers Mobilized with Exceptional Speed

Obstacles Added Outside the Western District

The Zi Lin Bao reports that the police stations of the Public Concession Police Department were preparing last night (3rd) for the upcoming anniversaries of 8/8 to 8/13. At 5:45 PM, a practice alarm was issued to each police station, and the police stations responded and set out. However, just after the teams returned to the police station after the assembly test, at 6:40 PM, the General Police Station issued a general alarm, ordering the search for three cars. A team of 30 people from the Lao Zha Police Station rushed to the Zhejiang Road Bridge to search cars coming from the north bank of the Suzhou River.

All vehicles were searched.

The drivers of the vehicles were brought into the Lao Zha Police Station, detained for about 20 minutes, and released after explaining to the police station that they were not one of the people being searched by the police station. A patrol team from the Putuo Road Police Station patrolled Robert Sheng Road and the surrounding area yesterday, searching pedestrians and arresting 30 suspects. The patrol ended at midnight. It is heard that the roads along the border of the western district have

Erected Obstacles

French Concession patrols were also busy searching pedestrians at the intersection of Haig Road and Xiafei Road. The precautionary measures and mobilization plan had not been fully determined last night. Officers from the foreign defense forces of the two concessions will hold a meeting today (4th) to formulate a plan. It is heard that from August 8th to 16th, all police personnel will have their leave canceled, and the hand-held machine guns normally maintained by the reserve team have been distributed to each police station to prepare for any terrorist incidents.

Also, the Mainland News reports that the Public Concession Police Department heard rumors yesterday afternoon that some

thugs

had crossed into the Public Concession from "Bad Land" and intended to carry out shooting atrocities again in the newspaper concentration area of 爱多亚路. Therefore, the reserve police were sent to the Jing'an Temple Road area to conduct a rapid search of cars, trams, and buses. At the same time, patrolmen erected obstacles along the roads outside the border in the western district to prevent other thugs from entering the Public Concession. Until late yesterday, many obstacles remained, which indicated that they would be removed only after the

Two-Week Anniversary

of the outbreak of the Shanghai War on 8/13. As a result of the police department's rapid action, traffic along Jing'an Temple Road was blocked, and the search team strictly blocked every car coming from the western district. The French Concession police authorities cooperated with the Public Concession and began a wide search of pedestrians and vehicles in the newspaper concentration area of 爱多亚路 from around 5:00 PM, which lasted until after 10:00 PM. Various

rumors

were rife in the newspaper concentration area, some saying that nine cars carrying terrorists had set out from "Bad Land" and driven into the city to attack the newspapers. Whether this statement was based on fact may never be known. If it were true, it would be due to the fact that the mobs were startled by the sudden police precautions taken. The police department admitted that there were a few thugs in the Public Concession, so the search was carried out. It is heard that some of these thugs were the mobs who had several clashes with Italian soldiers on Jiesfeier Road yesterday morning.

### British and French Passenger Liners to Arrive in Port this Afternoon

The regular passenger liner Carthage of the British Company's European route, which departed from London on June 30th and came to the Far East, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow.

It will carry 25 passengers, who will change to small boats prepared by the company from Qichang Wharf and land at the Xinguang Wharf at 6:30 PM. The large boat is scheduled to set sail at 7:00 AM on the 7th and go to Kobe and Yokohama. It will return to Shanghai in late this month and return to Europe. The French passenger ship President Doumer, will also arrive in Shanghai from Marseille this afternoon and stop at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers will take small boats to the Xinguang Wharf to land. The large boat is scheduled to go to Kobe, Japan from Shanghai next Monday (7th), and will return to Shanghai in mid-month and return to Marseille.

### Jardine Company Manager Pan Tanghua Returns to Shanghai - Left Shanghai for Five Months to Promote Domestic Goods - Manufacturers Welcome Him Today

Mr. Pan Tanghua, manager of Jardine Company in this city, is most enthusiastic about promoting domestic goods. In March of this year, he left Shanghai to go abroad to Singapore, Makassar, Surabaya, Batavia, Deli Medan, and the British Islands to investigate the domestic goods industry. During this period, the domestic goods manufacturers in this city relied on Mr. Pan's efforts to transport a large amount of goods to that area. It is now heard that Mr. Pan has completed his investigation and departed from Hong Kong on the President Doumer, and will arrive in Shanghai today. After hearing the news, the manufacturers have elected representatives to go to the pier to welcome him. At that time, Mr. Pan will make great contributions to the domestic goods manufacturers.

### Mountain Torrent Outburst: Guizhou-Vietnam Railway Traffic Interrupted; Passengers Must Disembark, Transfer, and Re-board Trains; Goods Piling Up at Haiphong, Shipments Temporarily Suspended

Hanoi-Dong Dang Traffic Hindered

According to someone who recently returned to Shanghai from Haiphong, the Guizhou-Vietnam Railway between Hanoi and Dong Dang has recently been disrupted again by mountain torrents. The amount of roadbed that has been washed away reaches as much as eleven kilometers. Therefore, passengers traveling that section must take boats and rickshaws for part of the journey and then transfer to trains to reach their final destinations. Due to the aforementioned obstruction, there are restrictions on luggage; each person is only allowed to carry thirty kilograms to be transported by the railway bureau. Furthermore, the highway between Hanoi and Dong Dang is also impassable, currently suspended due to flooding.

Goods Stockpiling Again at Haiphong

Currently, Haiphong is regarded as the only transshipment port for goods transported from Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places to the interior. Consequently, imported goods at Haiphong often experience unsorted accumulation. In March and April of this year, there was a period when goods piled up excessively, making storage temporarily impossible, so imports were restricted. Later, through vigorous efforts to clear the backlog, increasing vehicles, and constructing warehouses, the situation eased. Now, a letter from Haiphong reports that warehouses, customs storehouses, and nearby open spaces are all full of goods, making further stockpiling impossible. Moreover, with the rainy season approaching, even open spaces cannot be used for storing goods. There have been cases where entire ships of goods, after arriving at Haiphong, have been unable to unload and have been returned to their ports of origin. Therefore, all transportation agencies have temporarily suspended accepting goods for transport to Haiphong.

### A Certain Party, Under the Guise of Recruiting Workers, Deceives Workers into Going to Qingdao, Imprisons and Trains Them, Forcing Them to Fight Elsewhere; Two Workers Escape to Shanghai, Recounting Their Deception

The Daguang News Agency reports that previously, it was reported that a certain party instigated ruffians to secretly come to Shanghai under the pretense of recruiting workers to load and unload goods, but in reality, all were forcibly taken to Qingdao, imprisoned, and trained. Yesterday, a reporter from the Daguang News Agency met two coolie workers, Zhu Xuechang and Qian Wenchang, who had just escaped from Qingdao, who described their experience of being deceived in detail. According to them, "We two originally lived in a shantytown in the western district of the concession. Last week, we met

a person we didn't know,

who said that the wages we earned doing work in Shanghai, just a few dimes a day, were insufficient to maintain our lives. It would be best to go with him (the person referred to himself) to do seawall work outside Wusongkou. We could get a settlement allowance of two yuan at the time, and afterwards, we could get wages of one yuan and fifty cents a day. We two were deceived by the lure of profit, so the next morning, led by the person, along with many

recruited workers

and us two, we first took a barge from the Bund to Pudong, then a small steamer to outside Wusongkou. We were immediately forced onto a transport ship of a certain party and driven into a corner under the deck. After three days, the ship loaded more than a thousand Chinese people and sailed directly to Qingdao. We landed at a wharf with an unknown name and were escorted to various warehouses along the coast, where we were trained every day, with beatings at every turn.

Suffering Extensively Described

The warehouse doors were all fitted with iron bars, under very strict surveillance, exerting maximum pressure. After we were lured in and trained, the workers secretly told us that after three months, we would be sent to fight. Those who were successively sent off were numerous. Hearing this,

we shuddered with fear.

So we feigned illness, and during our isolation, we took the opportunity to break through the fence and escape to a foreign ship for help. With the permission of the Westerners, they secretly brought the two of us back to Shanghai." They were filled with sobs. It has also been learned that regarding the above situation, the Japanese concession is still very active in recruiting workers through deception. It is hoped that all sectors will inform the workers not to fall into the trap again.

### British Missionaries in Occupied Areas Have Suffered Significant Oppression; Many Missionaries in the Interior Have Withdrawn Under Threat; The Chinese People Generally Do Not Sympathize with Anti-British Sentiments

The *China Press* reports that the anti-British movement launched by the Japanese in all occupied areas of China is rampant, and its attention has now turned to British missionaries, who are now often subjected to pressure from the Japanese authorities. In recent weeks, Shanghai has received several reports of British missionaries being evicted from their properties and mistreated. However, so far, due to postal disruptions and traffic obstructions, there is little reliable information describing the truth in the occupied areas. Yesterday (the 3rd), according to staff from the China Inland Mission and the British Baptist Mission speaking to reporters, regarding the recent anti-British actions in the mission areas, although they did not have much information, they did know for certain that missionaries in the interior had withdrawn from their properties under threat, and other movements to expel Central Church missionaries in the occupied areas were in full swing. Properties of the China

Inland Mission affected by this movement include Linfen and Hongdong in Shanxi, where all British personnel have withdrawn. British personnel in Kaifeng, Henan, have also withdrawn, and the properties were subsequently sealed by the local police authorities. As a result of this action by the Japanese in Kaifeng, more than one hundred patients in the church hospital were forced to leave the hospital, many of whom had just undergone surgery and were in critical condition. It is believed that they did not find other places of refuge to accommodate these patients. British personnel of the British Baptist Mission

who withdrew under intimidation include those in Taiyuan, Xinzhou, and Daizhou (transliteration). Most of the missionaries who withdrew have gone to Beidaihe. There is no definite report yet, but it is believed that the property has not been damaged. According to reports from Linfen, church properties there were damaged by Koreans disguised as Chinese and "Manchus," but there is no news of the extent of the damage reaching Shanghai. The properties in Kaifeng and Hongdong are believed to be undamaged. An official from the China Inland Mission stated that the Chinese are indifferent to the Japanese's anti-British movement.

News received in Shanghai has proven that the Japanese themselves are carrying out all the incitement with the help of transferred people, "Manchus," and a few local ruffians. It is heard that there is a similar anti-British movement in the Changzhi area of Shanxi, where there is a sauce factory. There is an urgent desire to receive some news from that location. Another group of missionaries expelled by the Japanese army are stranded in Shijiazhuang due to flooding. It is not known whether they belong to the China Inland Mission. The official reiterated that the Chinese people do not sympathize with the anti-British movement, saying that after the uproar in Hongdong, the local

Chinese delegation apologized to the church and refuted the Japanese claims of general animosity towards the British in the area. Since the British are not allowed to enter Kaifeng or reside there, the China Inland Mission sent two American personnel to Kaifeng to take care of the property. The two are expected to be responsible for continuing the work, allowing them to serve in the hospital. Although the British in Shanxi have been subjected to harsh treatment, there are still a few missionaries in the southern part of the province. It is not yet known whether they are suffering significant oppression. The official believes that the anti-British uproar is limited to

large cities tightly controlled by the Japanese. Elsewhere, the Chinese treat the British as usual. The British in Kaifeng withdrew from their properties because of the deadline to leave the country. There was a demonstration by a crowd of twenty or thirty people in the church compound, funded by the Japanese with two or three dimes. The missionary wanted to stay in the area to do medical work to save the number of patients in critical condition, but was forced to leave, it is said.

### Resumption of Personal Small Packages to Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Guangxi

Due to traffic congestion and transportation difficulties, the shipping of large and small parcels from Shanghai to Xi'an, Lanzhou, Guangxi Province, and other places was temporarily suspended. After the Shanghai Postal Administration's Transportation Section made repeated efforts, shipping of large and small parcels to the above-mentioned places has resumed. Except for large-volume commercial parcels, which are still temporarily suspended, personal small packages and small packages of medicine have been resumed. However, they must be genuine personal parcels, and commercial goods must not be mixed in. Each item is limited to two kilograms. Detailed regulations for fees to be charged are in place.

### Japanese Bombardment of Pudong Proves the Activity of Chinese Troops; Rumor of Chinese Troops Attacking Japanese Troops in Chuansha and Nanhui; Japanese Warships Opened Fire for an Hour

Yesterday morning around three o'clock, there was a sudden burst of artillery fire from the Shanghai East area, faintly audible in the concessions. In the Yangshupu and Pingliang Road areas, it was clearly heard. Residents were awakened from their sleep in great terror, believing that guerrillas were attacking Shanghai. Around four o'clock at dawn, the artillery fire gradually subsided. After investigation, it was found that the artillery fire came from Japanese warships anchored off the coast of Wusongkou. It is heard that, given the increasingly active guerrillas in the suburbs of Shanghai, and the frequent attacks by the Chinese side on Pudong, Nanhui, Chuansha, and other places, the Japanese warships fired artillery at Pudong yesterday morning in an attempt to threaten the guerrillas active in Pudong and other places. Moreover, recently, Japanese warships have been frequently shining searchlights towards Pudong and Zhabei in the middle of the night. Due to the sudden tightening of Japanese defenses, it is evident that the guerrillas in the suburbs of Shanghai are indeed quite active.

The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reports that from 3:00 to 4:30 this morning (the 12th), someone heard Japanese warships heavily bombarding Pudong near Wusong, which confirms the Chinese reports of guerrilla attacks on Japanese garrisons in the Chuansha and Nanhui districts. It is heard that Chinese mobile troops outside the walls of Nanhui City are extremely active, sending small teams to the suburbs to lure the Japanese, while large teams ambush the Japanese troops who come to attack.

### After Maintenance by the Exchange Equalization Fund, National Foreign Exchange Stabilizes; Foreign Exchange is Supplied as Much as Possible for the Import of Essential Goods; Black Market Foreign Exchange in Occupied Areas is Difficult to Eliminate

After the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee maintained the national foreign exchange with all its strength, it finally stabilized. The legal price has not changed. Essential goods are supplied as much as possible. After the international trade was adjusted, the foreign exchange fund became more substantial. However, it is difficult to eliminate black market foreign exchange. The details are as follows:

After Maintenance, Foreign Exchange Stabilizes

Since the success of the £10 million loan from the British Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Mercantile Bank, and the Chinese Bank of Communications and the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee, it has made every effort to maintain the legal price of foreign exchange. The price of foreign exchange in all parts of the country, except for the occupied areas, has always been stable: (1) British exchange, one shilling and two and a half pence; (2) US exchange, thirty US dollars; (3) French exchange, one thousand and eighty French francs; (4) German exchange, seventy-five marks; (5) Hong Kong exchange, ninety-five Hong Kong dollars. Regarding the occupied areas of Shanghai, Tianjin, etc., there is the so-called black market for foreign exchange, where the price of foreign exchange is quite different from the legal price, about three-quarters lower.

Essential Goods Supplied as Much as Possible

All imported goods operated by importers that are not on the list of prohibited imports and are necessary for the country can apply to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee to purchase foreign exchange, which is handled by the Chinese Bank of Communications and the Bank of China. However, applicants must pay a balancing fee based on the difference between the legal price and the posted price of the two banks. However, if imported goods are imported through the occupied customs, they will not be eligible to apply for legal foreign exchange. Therefore, there is no establishment of a Foreign Exchange Review Committee in Shanghai, and the Chinese Bank of Communications and the Bank of China do not have posted prices. The Central Bank only publishes the legal foreign exchange price on a daily basis.

Black Market Foreign Exchange Difficult to Eliminate

The so-called black market foreign exchange in Shanghai is beyond the reach of the government and difficult to suppress. The Jianghai Customs, after being robbed, cannot implement measures to prohibit the import of goods and the settlement of foreign exchange for the export of local goods to collect the difference. Therefore, luxury goods and non-essential goods can still be imported through the Jianghai Customs. The purchase of foreign exchange for these goods has to rely on the Shanghai foreign exchange black market. Therefore, it is difficult to reduce the foreign exchange in the black market in practice. However, in order to prevent prohibited goods from being mixed into the interior, the re-export and mailing to non-occupied areas have been prohibited.

Adjusting Trade to Replenish Foreign Exchange

After the adjustment of international trade, the export of major local products such as tea, tung oil, bristles, and minerals has increased sharply, and foreign exchange has been sold to the government. The import of non-essential goods has been prohibited by government order, so China's foreign exchange fund is increasingly substantial. In addition, remittances from overseas Chinese have increased sharply after the war, as well as (1) cultural undertakings fees from various countries to China, (2) berthing and repair fees for foreign ships, (3) expenses for foreign warships and stationing in China, (4) expenses for foreign embassies in China, and (5) expenses for foreigners traveling in China, are all intangible income for China, which can offset part of the trade deficit.

Tightening of the Black Market Benefits China

The depreciation of the value of the legal currency in the Shanghai black market is actually the result of speculation by criminals, but it has no great impact on China's legal currency policy, and it will not cause any loss to the international credit of China's finances. Moreover, from the perspective of international trade, it is beneficial to China. As foreign currency prices rise, the prices of imported goods increase. The first to suffer are foreign merchants, while China can create national thrift and reduce the trade deficit. Therefore, the Chinese government has no reason to maintain the Shanghai foreign exchange black market. Therefore, it is heard that the Exchange Equalization Committee will allow the Shanghai black market foreign exchange to take its natural course.

Suppressing Speculation to Stabilize Society

The main forces behind the fluctuations in black market foreign exchange are (1) the exchange market, (2) the foreign currency banknote market, and (3) the gold market. The maintenance of the exchange market is mainly by banks, the foreign currency banknote trading market is mainly by Qianzhuang, and the gold market is mainly by Qianzhuang and silver shops. Now, Chinese and foreign financial authorities will strictly review the types of transactions to avoid arbitrage speculation, such as restricting the supply of black market foreign exchange and stopping foreign exchange swaps, in order to avoid excessive fluctuations in the exchange market, causing market chaos and social unrest among the people.

Special Concert in Zhaofeng Park

The Municipal Council Music Team is scheduled to hold a special concert in Zhaofeng Park from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM this (5th) evening (weather permitting). Mr. Klasha, a famous Austrian singer, will participate in singing famous songs. There are six items on the program.

### Japanese Troops Rampage Along the Coast Without Significant Value; Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Huang Shaohong's Report; Determines that Japan No Longer Has the Strength to Expand its Occupied Areas

The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Huang Shaohong, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, recently reported on the recent situation in Zhejiang Province and future response policies at a joint memorial week for party and government agencies, stating that the Japanese's harassment in various coastal areas of Zhejiang Province is part of the Japanese's overall policy, not a local action. The occupation of parts of Dinghai and Yuhuan counties has no significant value from a military point of view; the purpose is harassment. Regarding the overall war situation, Huang determined that the Japanese no longer have the strength to expand their occupied areas. Future response policies: (1) Strengthen political power to ensure military victory, strive to stabilize society, and cultivate local forces for long-term combat; (2) Strive for self-reliance and break the blockade plan. A. Strengthen international awareness and eliminate dependence; B. Strive for self-sufficiency and do not rely on external forces; (3) Implement political austerity and save waste. A. Strive to save on external things, and manage gasoline and kerosene; B. Study substitutes, and try to substitute everything that can be substituted; C. Improve technology and step up production; (4) Find new sources of tax revenue and establish a new financial foundation, implement public management and exclusive sales of various enterprises.

### Fire Insurance Issues Worth Studying: Shenxin Factory Sues Three Insurance Companies; Whether it is a State of War is the Focus of the Dispute

Rong Buren, the legal representative of Shenxin Textile General Company, recently hired lawyers Lu Congzu and He Baiqian to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court against Ding Xuetong, the legal representative of Taiping Insurance Company on Jiangxi Road, Guo Fuyun, the legal representative of China Insurance Company on Sichuan Road, and Wang Renquan, the legal representative of China Tianyi Insurance Company on Beijing Road, seeking compensation for fire insurance losses. The gist of the lawsuit is that the plaintiff company has Shenxin No. 7 Factory located at 468 Yangshupu Road in this city, with an attached warehouse, the building of which is a four-story Western-style warehouse, storing cotton and cotton cloth, underwritten by the defendant insurance companies, etc., with

fire insurance.

The warehouse is divided into eight warehouses, identified with numbers. Only Warehouse No. 3 and Warehouse No. 5 suffered losses due to the fire. Taiping jointly insured 900,000 yuan for Warehouse No. 3, and China jointly insured 400,000 yuan. The goods in Warehouse No. 5 were insured for 320,000 yuan by Taiping and 50,000 yuan by China Tianyi. The fire occurred on December 10, 1937, in the plaintiff's warehouse, causing severe damage to the goods in Warehouse No. 3 and Warehouse No. 5. Therefore, the plaintiff made a request to the defendants. If they could not agree on the submitted loss list, then, according to Article 18 of the insurance contract,

submit to arbitration.

Until August 22 of last year, the defendants still refused to select an arbitrator. The attitude of the defendants actually hindered the plaintiff's progress, because the contractual clause stipulated that no lawsuit could be filed without prior arbitration, so it was necessary to submit to arbitration first. Therefore, the legal counsel of the plaintiff selected accountant Li as the sole arbitrator. After careful investigation, the judgment result was that the amount of fire loss for Warehouse No. 3 was 329,736.20 yuan, and for Warehouse No. 5, it was 191,314.65 yuan. Based on the judgment result, the plaintiff entrusted Paget & Co. at No. 12 Huangpu Beach Road, Shanghai, to calculate the above

loss amount

and the amount to be apportioned by each defendant company and foreign insurance company under each insurance contract. On April 14 this year, Paget & Co. replied to the plaintiff's legal counsel with the calculated amount. According to its calculation, the first defendant, Taiping Insurance Company, should be responsible for paying 356,982.50 yuan, the second defendant, China Insurance Company, should be responsible for paying 91,273.13 yuan, and the third defendant, China Tianyi Insurance Company, should be responsible for paying 20,985.42 yuan, totaling 469,241.05 yuan. The plaintiff made this

apportionment calculation

to the defendants, requesting payment of the full amount, but was refused. Therefore, the lawsuit was filed, requesting a legal judgment for compensation, and bearing the litigation costs. It is also requested that a provisional execution be declared for this judgment, etc. After receiving the summons, the defendant Taiping, China, Tianyi, and other insurance companies also separately hired lawyers E Sen and Liu Shifang to file a defense, stating that the plaintiff's lawsuit against the defendants for compensation is based on the fire insurance contract signed by both parties. However, Article 6 of the contract stipulates that the insurer is not liable for losses occurring during the term of the contract under extraordinary circumstances. However, if the insured can prove that the cause of the damage has

absolutely no relation to the existence of extraordinary circumstances,

the insurer shall be liable for compensation. The last item of the same article also stipulates that the burden of proof in this case shall be borne by the insured. The location of the insured property in this case is the cotton and cotton cloth in the warehouse at No. 468 Yangshupu Road in the eastern district of the Public Concession, and the fire occurred on the morning of December 10, 1937. Since August 13, the area has been a base for Japanese military operations and is still under occupation and siege today. This is an obvious fact. Now, the plaintiff cannot prove that the defendants have no obligation to compensate in principle. The plaintiff misunderstood

the meaning of the insurance contract,

arbitrated, and requested compensation based on the amount obtained from illegal arbitration, which is unreasonable and should be rejected, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Fuji heard the case. In addition to stating the reasons for the lawsuit, the plaintiffs' attorneys Lu Congzu and He Baiqian stated that our national army withdrew from the north on October 27, 1937, and from the south city and Pudong area on November 11 and 12. The Shenxin warehouse caught fire at 8:00 AM on December 10, which was more than 40 days after the withdrawal of the national army. There was no state of war in the area. As for the

cause of the fire,

the plaintiff certainly does not know, but it was absolutely not destroyed by artillery fire or airplane bombs. Moreover, there is one most important point, that is, the 50,000 yuan insurance policy of Taiping Insurance Company was only issued on November 26, 1937, just over ten days before the fire. Having issued the policy, it should be liable for compensation. They also submitted the Municipal Council Gazette and the report of the Fire Brigade to prove that the fire was on the morning of November 10. However, the defendants' attorneys, E Sen and Liu Shifang, still used extraordinary circumstances as a reason for defense. Judge Xu instructed that the case be rescheduled for review.

Driver Commits Homicide Due to Negligence

Wang Jincai, a driver of the public bus company from Funing, was driving public bus No. 15042 east on Shandong Road on the morning of the 28th of last month when the brakes failed, killing pedestrian Hua Xiangsheng. After investigation by the police, he was prosecuted for negligent homicide. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Peishen concluded the trial and ordered the defendant to pay 1,000 yuan bail and await sentencing.

### Ma Ruqi Arrested and Released After Rescue Efforts; Japanese Lightly Believe the Words of a Witch and Make Indiscriminate Arrests; Said to Be Related to the Murder Case of the Yongyuan Boss

Zhang Amao (also known as Kang Meinian, 31 years old), the boss of the Shuiyuan gambling den at No. 6 Anlefang, at the intersection of Route des Soeurs and Route Cardinal Foch in western Shanghai, was shot and killed at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Dufeng Road at 8:40 PM on the 28th of last month. The murderer is at large. The details were reported in this newspaper. Until the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 3rd), Ma Ruqi, a local merchant residing at No. 31, Lane 598, Route Bayle, French Concession, was at the Dasheng Club in Xinkangli, Caojiadu, western Shanghai,

talking with friends,

when a Japanese man claiming to be from the Entertainment Venue Supervision Office suddenly came, claiming that in the Zhang Kangmei assassination case, someone had reported that Ma was a major suspect and had come to arrest him. At that time, someone explained to him, but the Japanese man threatened him. Ma had no choice but to go with the Japanese man. After hearing the news, Ma's relatives and friends tried every means to intercede, and he was not released until yesterday morning. However, after investigation, Ma's

reason for being arrested

is said to be that a witch (commonly known as a fairy), who likes gambling, is a customer of the Yongyuan gambling den. The day before yesterday (the 2nd), the witch came to Yongyuan to gamble heavily. In the midst of her gambling excitement, the witch suddenly changed her normal state and claimed that she was possessed by a wronged ghost, and that the wronged ghost was Zhang Kangmei, who had been shot and killed, shouting that the murderer was Xiao Wang (Xiao Wang was the co-founder of Yongyuan gambling den with Zhang Kangmei and is now on the run). She further claimed that the day before Zhang was killed, Xiao Wang had been at Ma Ruqi's home

plotting with Ma.

At that time, Zhang's family was present and, upon hearing this, lightly believed the above-mentioned ghost story and secretly reported it to the Japanese, and the Japanese immediately used the witch's words as evidence to arrest Ma. This is truly an interesting story amidst the rampant arrests in this city, and it is similar to the ancient King Li's use of witches to monitor and slander people and arbitrarily harm the people.

According to the Huawen News Agency, at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 3rd), the booth of Yongfang, an upper store in the Dasheng gambling den in Xinkangli, Caojiadu, western Shanghai, was finished and being taken over by Ma Shigan,

when suddenly several plainclothes personnel from a certain party came, approached Ma, and ordered him to go with them. Ma, seeing the situation was bad, quickly explained that he had no enemies recently, that he was a law-abiding person, and had not done anything out of line, but the plainclothes personnel were impatient and

slapped the bodyguard standing next to the gambling table. Their momentum was fierce. When the two sides were at a stalemate, Wang Wenbo, the manager of the gambling den, knew it was inevitable, so he

stepped forward

and advised Ma that it would be better to go with them and that he was willing to go along. Ma agreed and went out to the door. The plainclothes personnel immediately forced Ma into a car that had been waiting and sped westward. Wang Wenbo was left outside the door and did not go with them. It is heard that this case was led by Zhang, but the reason is unknown.

### Head of the Xianyue Dance Hall Arrested for Embezzlement

Sheng Yong, from Ningbo, lived at No. 3, Lane Tong'an, Route Kaimier, French Concession. He was the manager of the dancers (commonly known as the head of the dancers) at the Xianyue Dance Hall run by Xie Baosheng on Jing'an Temple Road. However, Xie Baosheng recently discovered that Sheng Yong had embezzled 350.49 yuan since April of this year and fled. He reported this to the Xinzha Police Station, and Hua Detective Ye Yushan arrested Sheng at the Dadong Billiard Room the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police Attorney Wang Yaotang prosecuted him for embezzlement under Article 336 of the Criminal Code. After interrogation by Judge Xiao, he was ordered to be returned to custody pending further investigation and a seven-day adjournment for another hearing.

### Dancer Disappearance - Accusations of Abduction by Male Patron - Chen Weiling Detained for Investigation

Chen Weiling, a native of Wuxi and an employee of Dachong Company at No. 8, Lane 197, Seymour Road, was an avid frequenter of dance halls, rarely missing an evening. He became intimately acquainted with Lin Shuzhen, an eighteen-year-old dancer from the Shanghai Dance Hall on Wuma Road. As extreme affection often turns to resentment, their relationship was marked by frequent ups and downs, a situation her mother was powerless to control. One afternoon at 3:30 PM, the pair had another argument at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road. Initially, they were whispering sweet nothings and holding hands, but soon they were hurling insults at each other, as if irreconcilable enemies. Suddenly, after the quarrel, Lin Shuzhen vanished. Her mother, unwilling to lose this cash cow from her grasp, reported the incident to the Lao Zha gate police station, accusing Chen Weiling of abduction and requesting an investigation. The police chief dispatched Chinese Detective Sun Dafa, along with a Western detective, to the Dachong Company, where they detained Chen. Yesterday morning, Chen was brought before the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian briefly outlined the case, stating that Lin Shuzhen had indeed been abducted by Chen and that a detailed investigation was necessary. He requested that Chen remain in custody pending a full investigation. Judge Xiao then questioned the defendant, but Chen denied the charges and retained lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang for his defense. Ultimately, the court, citing the ongoing investigation, granted the police's request to keep Chen in custody and adjourned the hearing.

### Deposit Dispute - Both Sides Hold Conflicting Accounts

Chu Shuncai, a native of Wuxi in his thirties, runs the Taifeng Fur and Bone Shop at No. 73, Moller Street in the French Concession. Recently, Xi Benchu, a native of Jiangyin, through his lawyer, filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court, Criminal Division, accusing Chu Shuncai of embezzling a deposit of 3,500 yuan. The case was heard yesterday in the Second Criminal Court by Judge Zhu Chuzhe. The plaintiff, Xi Benchu, was represented by his lawyer, who presented the following

Plaintiff's Claim

The plaintiff formerly owned the Xixi Store on Wuding Road in the International Settlement. On December 2nd of last year, he deposited 5,000 yuan in cash with the defendant, Chu Shuncai, who issued a deposit book with the stipulation that the money could be withdrawn after three days. The deposit book was witnessed by Li Rongsheng and Zhu Shunxiang, among others. However, the defendant only paid the plaintiff 1,500 yuan, leaving 3,500 yuan unpaid. The defendant then

Published a Notice

in the newspapers, stating that the 2,000 yuan deposit book issued to Xi Liben had been fully paid and was now void. While Xi Liben is not the plaintiff, the defendant's intention was to manipulate the plaintiff and attempt to embezzle the 3,500 yuan deposit. Therefore, the plaintiff seeks to have the defendant arrested and brought to justice. Defense lawyer Pan Zhensheng, representing Chu Shuncai, replied that the defendant was unable to attend court due to illness. He stated that the facts of the case were not as presented by the plaintiff's lawyer. The defendant previously operated the Hengfeng Shipping Company, which owned the Huadong steamboat. The boat was hijacked at Yanglinkou, and two

Passengers Were Kidnapped

(a businessman and an interpreter). Through Wang Tingzheng's efforts, they were ransomed for 12,000 yuan. An initial payment of 10,000 yuan was made, and for the remaining 2,000 yuan, the defendant, Chu Shuncai, issued a deposit book as a guarantee of payment. The defendant subsequently paid 1,500 yuan in cash, and the remaining 500 yuan was issued as a check. However, because the check could not be fully cashed, the plaintiff, Xi Benchu, filed a criminal lawsuit. After reviewing the testimonies, the court decided to adjourn the case until August 18th, when both parties would be summoned to appear in court for further questioning.

### Apprentice Factory Worker - Fraudulently Cashes Check - Sentenced to One Year and Six Months

Fan Benxi, an apprentice from Chongming at the Renhexiang Cloth Factory at No. 3, Lane 657, Ningbo Road, International Settlement, took a check from the factory the day before yesterday afternoon and cashed it for 1,250 yuan at the Futai Exchange. The exchange had previous dealings with Renhexiang and noticed that the seal on Fan's check did not match those of the past. They notified the factory owner, Guo Fucheng, who, after a detailed examination, confirmed it was a forgery. He reported it to the Lao Zha gate police station, which dispatched Detective Xu Fusheng and a Western detective to Futai, where they arrested Fan. They found three blank checks on his person and took them back to the police station for investigation. According to Fan's confession, he was instigated by Yin Zengrong, a native of Changzhou who managed the factory's labor accounts. Yin first stole the key to the silver box and then stole four blank checks from inside the box. Yin then filled in the amounts and had Fan cash them at Futai. Yin Zengrong was also arrested, but he denied the instigation. Yesterday morning, they were brought before the First Special District Court, where Judge Xiao conducted the trial. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian presented the case, and Guo Fucheng brought three large and small seals from Renhexiang to the court, proving the defendant's theft. The court questioned Fan Benxi, who confirmed that Yin was indeed the instigator. Yin claimed that Fan was falsely accusing him. Judge Xiao reviewed the evidence and determined that there was insufficient evidence against Yin Zengrong and acquitted him in court. Fan Benxi was sentenced to one year and six months imprisonment as a warning to others.

### Two Young Men - Suddenly Arrested - In Front of the First Special Court - By a Certain Special Agent

Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, near the First Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road, two Chinese youths in Western suits were suddenly arrested by several plainclothes agents from a certain faction. The agents immediately requested the Western police guarding the court entrance to temporarily hold the two youths while they notified the police station. However, the Western police refused. The agents then took the two youths to a cigarette shop on Qipu Road to use the phone to notify the police station. Shortly after, a police car arrived from the police station. The names of the two youths and the reasons for their arrest are unknown.

### "Clerk's Wife" Falsely Reports Robbery - Original Intention Was Extortion - "Fuxing Society" Member Demands Dismissal Fee - Forcibly Coercing Two Accused Sentenced to Imprisonment

At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, a Wuxi woman, Zhu Su, reported to the General Police Station that a group of thugs had snatched a gold ring worth 20 yuan from her finger. She said the robbers were hiding in Room 6111 of the Wugong Hotel on Fujian Road and requested they be apprehended. Chinese and Western detectives, acting on her report, went to the Wugong Hotel and arrested two suspects, Zhou Yizhang (aka Zhou Yongzhen), a native of Changzhou, and Chen Yongmo, a native of Guangdong. Under investigation, it became

Not Like a Robbery

and after severe questioning, she confessed that the case was actually one of extortion. According to Zhu Su's statement, her name is Su Xiaqin, and she lives at No. 10, Wenyuan Lane, Haining Road. She is the principal of the Ren Zhi School on Dongyouheng Road. Her husband, Zhu Ke (aka Zhu Mingde), is an organization clerk in the Fuxing Society on Xinming Road, Zhabei, earning a monthly salary of 50 yuan. Today, in addition to his regular work, he helped Clerk Ke distribute salaries to the members. Unexpectedly, at the end of June, the society's president, Zhang Mingxi, announced that starting from July, the

Society Would Be Disbanded

However, new members would be entitled to a dismissal fee of ten days' pay (all members received a monthly salary of 25 yuan), to be collected on July 25th. As the deadline had passed, Clerk Ke promised to pay on August 2nd. Yesterday, three member representatives, Gu Sen, Cheng Jie, and Zhou Yongzhi, arrived at the society, but Clerk Ke was not present. They turned to Zhu Ke and demanded money, also forcing him to go to Room 621 of the Wugong Hotel. As the situation was urgent, he

Could Not Resist

and had to go along. He then asked his wife to send a note to the house. Upon arriving at Wugong, she saw dozens of men surrounding her husband, forcing him to pay 200 yuan. They settled on 150 yuan, with the payment due the next day. At the time, the gold ring on her finger was snatched by Gu Sen and others, and her husband was released. At noon today, her husband suddenly received a call from Gu, demanding that the money be delivered by 6:00 PM, or his life would be in danger. Her husband, terrified, ran away, and she did not know where he went. In desperation, she

Falsely Reported a Robbery

to the police, and so on. The detectives detained Zhou and Chen. Yesterday morning, they were brought before Judge Fang Qinghuan of the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. After a clear interrogation, Zhou Shoutong and Chen Yongmo were found guilty of using violence to force a person to perform an action without obligation, and each was sentenced to three years imprisonment.

### Robbers' Cruel Methods - Setting Fire to Victims - Two Victims Severely Burned and in Critical Condition

Shao Bojun, 43, a native of Nanhui, Pudong, made a living selling chickens and ducks. He lived at No. 144, East Street, Datuan Town, Pudong. The day before yesterday, Shao hired a civilian boat to transport a large number of chickens and ducks to Shanghai for sale. As the boat passed the Zhagang port in Zhoupu Town around 5:00 AM yesterday, more than a dozen robbers on the shore, armed with guns, shouted, forcing them to stop the boat. The boat, unable to resist, had

to Dock

The robbers swarmed onto the boat, bound all the belongings and stole them away. Some robbers still not satisfied, dragged Shao Bojun and the boatman Zhou Ar Er ashore, using ropes to tie the two to a tree. They used firewood to light a fire, burning the two peoples lower body, forcing them to hand over the money. Shao, in great pain, said that there were still more than 40 yuan in the pile of firewood on the boat. The bandits plundered the amount, and left. Afterwards another boatman untied the two. They immediately took the original boat to Shanghai and sent to the hospital. Both people injured very seriously and feared for life.

### Soil Peddler Sentenced to Five Years in Prison

### Man Holding Hitler's Book Claims He Wants to Kill - Strange Man Clashes with Police - Sent to Hospital for Examination

Around 8:00 PM last night, in front of the Thames newspaper on the second floor of the Edward Road Thames Building, a man in his thirties wearing a silk long shirt held a book in his hand. It was a translation of the German leader Hitler's "Mein Kampf". He lingered in front of the newspaper office, looking around suspiciously. He was seen by the detectives on duty at the location, and they immediately went forward to question him. Unexpectedly, the person ignored them completely, and turned a deaf ear. The detective made further inquiries, and the man flew into a rage, and had an argument with the detectives, and said, "I want to kill people, what are you like!"

### Husband Bigamy - In-Laws Abuse - Zhou Li Requests Separate Residence

According to Huawen News Agency, Zhou Li, a 27-year-old woman from Yancheng, residing at No. 75, Dakang Village, Kanti Road, recently filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court, Civil Division, through her lawyer, seeking separate residence from her husband, Zhou Pinheng (formerly Huabu No. 763, son of Lu Ershun). According to the statement, due to open bigamy and abuse by her in-laws, it is difficult to live together, and a separate small family is requested. It is requested that the order be freely lived in. Zhou and the defendant have been married for three years, and their feelings have been good. However, due to the fact that the opposing party is in love with the prostitute A Zhang (who is said to have married), his attitude towards Zhou has changed drastically. If she protests, she is abused by her in-laws. She has been beaten several times and reported to the police. Therefore, she requests that she be ordered to leave the big family and form a separate small family, and that the order be issued to sever ties with A Zhang, and so on. The court approved the request. Yesterday, mediation failed in the Fourth Civil Court, and the court ordered a formal lawsuit.

### Disputes Over Setting Up Stalls on North Shanxi Road

More than 60 stores, including Yuqingtang Pharmacy on North Shanxi Road, jointly sent a letter to the police station opposing the establishment of stalls in front of their stores, requesting that they be driven away. After the stall vendors petitioned, the Shanghai Municipal Council Director General approved the establishment of stalls, and the order there was good. On the morning of the first of this month, more than ten Chinese police officers and three or four Western police officers suddenly ordered the stall vendors to leave. The stall vendors were panic-stricken and filed a petition with the Shanghai Municipal Council to seek relief.

It was also reported that the vendors along North Shanxi Road appealed to various groups for assistance because the stores on the road opposed the establishment of stalls. Now, the Haining Road Police Station, in view of the fact that most of the vendors were poor refugees, is providing free accommodation for the vendors along the road and advising them to join the market to set up stalls for business. Those who are not able to move in at once are temporarily allowed to set up stalls north of North Shanxi Road, north of Tiantong Road, and south of Santai Lane, in order to gradually correct the situation, so that traffic, hygiene and the livelihood of the poor can be taken care of at the same time. The vendors have agreed to accept it.

The attached civil suit was transferred to the civil court for trial.

### The Saving for Disaster Relief Society Announces that Saving Ghosts is Not as Good as Saving People

The City Saving for Disaster Relief Committee announced the diversion of Daoist ritual expenses to relieve refugees in an announcement that reads: The country is in trouble, and people are suffering. Everything that can be saved should be conserved as much as possible. Moreover, holding Daoist rituals for ghosts is a superstitious activity. As the saying goes, "If you cannot serve the living, how can you serve the dead? If you do not know life, how can you know death?" At this time when saving people is not enough and survival is difficult, how can we devote our great spirit and precious materials to appeasing ghosts? Mr. Jin Zongcheng, chairman of the Xin Xin Company, previously proposed diverting Daoist ritual expenses to relieve refugees. His benevolent words and good deeds are worthy of admiration. We also ask all hometown associations, guilds, institutions, organizations, and residents of each alleyway in this city to use their real hearts and efforts to eliminate the bad habit of holding Daoist rituals, divert the shared expenses, save for disaster relief, and send them to the various banks in the city at any time, to be credited to the account of this association. Accumulating small amounts into large amounts, and universally saving the afflicted, will be a hundred thousand times more blessed than saving ghosts.

### Finance - What Relationship Do New Banknotes Have to the Present - The Foreign Exchange Market Has Another Buying Spree

Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: The HSBC listing did not fluctuate. In the black market for British and American currencies, the price started to increase due to the purchase of oil companies such as Texaco Asia, Asiatic, and others such as Hesheng Xinfeng, as well as Japanese banks. In addition, HSBC only agreed to maintain the price of British gold at four pence three one two five in the morning, leading to a tight trend in the market. In the afternoon, rumors spread that the Ministry of Finance was printing new banknotes in England, which led to the mistaken belief that it was related to finance and the idea of capital flight. In fact, this large batch of banknotes is still being printed and cannot be completed in a short period of time. It is possible that it will be used for post-war reorganization and reconstruction. How is it related to the present? This started a speculative trend, and panic and buying increased. Chinese and Western speculators and foreign companies scrambled to settle, and HSBC was willing to sell, which made the market tighter. As a result, the market closed at four pence one nine six eight seven five for British gold and eight yuan three one two five for US exchange. The August futures also followed the same trend, ultimately with British gold tighter by one two five and US exchange softer by two five. The day's trading was still active.

After the opening, foreign companies such as Xinfeng and Hesheng came to buy and settle. First, foreign banks settled spot British gold at four pence three seven five, and then bought and settled spot US exchange at eight yuan five six two five from a certain bank. As a result, the process was slightly soft. When the HSBC listing was announced, it remained unchanged. After the announcement of the silver balance tax, it was still exempt from taxation. After that, Japanese banks also bought spot British gold at four pence three seven five from foreign banks, and spot US exchange at eight yuan five six two five. At the same time, foreign banks mutually made spot British gold at four pence four zero six two five, so the condition was still level. Around 10:00 AM, oil companies frequently came to buy and settle, and HSBC's willingness to sell was weak, which made the market continue to tighten. Texaco settled spot US exchange at eight yuan half from a certain bank, and then Asiatic also bought spot British gold at four pence three four three seven five from foreign banks such as Huabi. Soon, it also bought spot British gold from HSBC at only four pence three one two five. At the same time, the spot US exchange from the bank was also returned at eight yuan four three seven five. Later, a certain bank stuffed a certain amount of this month's US exchange at eight yuan zero six two five and spot US exchange at eight yuan five three one two five to a peer bank. Until the midday close, the bank's spot selling price was four pence three seven five for British gold and eight yuan half for US exchange, which was higher by 0.03125 for British gold and softer by 0.09375 for US exchange compared to the morning opening.

In the afternoon market, a Western merchant, Sassoon, first settled spot British gold at four pence three four three seven five from a foreign bank. At that time, a rumor suddenly spread in the market that the Ministry of Finance would add new banknotes, which led to foreign companies and Chinese merchants scrambling to buy and settle, so the condition became even tighter. Foreign companies and Chinese merchants successively settled spot British gold at four pence three one two five from foreign banks, and spot US exchange at eight yuan three seven five. Later, the Chinese merchants also bought this month's US exchange at eight yuan zero six two five and eight yuan from Datong Bank. Until the evening close, the bank's spot selling price was four pence two nine six eight seven five for British gold and eight yuan three one two five for US exchange, and four pence one two five for British gold and eight yuan for US exchange for this month.

### Sudden Talk of Additional Printing of New Banknotes, Gold Prices Rise Again, Reaching a High of $3,710

Yesterday, the black market price of cash gold surged due to tightening foreign exchange. It opened with a jump of $20. Because wealthy locals and Hong Kong merchants absorbed a considerable amount, and floating investors also followed suit, the price rose to $3,675. After 10 AM, as the number of buyers gradually decreased, general speculators took the opportunity to profit from the high price and sell, causing the price to fall back to a low of $3,620, the opening price in the morning. At noon, due to the upward trend and retail investors buying at low prices, the price rose again to between $3,650 and $3,660. The afternoon trend became even tighter, as rumors suddenly spread in the market that the Ministry of Finance was printing new banknotes abroad, causing foreign exchange to continue to tighten. Buyers were eager to buy, dragging and taking advantage, becoming increasingly excited. The price broke through the $3,700 mark, reaching a high of $3,710. However, before the closing, due to some profit-taking on the day's gains, the price retreated slightly. As a result, it still rose by $95, with active trading of about one thousand taels. Gold ornaments in silver shops rose by $10. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Cash Gold Up $95

From the morning, the price per bar (ten taels) initially rose by $20 as soon as the market opened, due to news of a slight softening of foreign exchange and strengthened confidence. Gold shops and silver shops bought at $3,620 per ten taels. After the opening, as buying intentions remained strong, a certain money exchange business acted as an agent for wealthy individuals to absorb the gold. Although a certain "Ling" firm (representing speculators) and securities firms took profits on their overnight long positions, and silver shops also slightly sold to hedge, the market remained firm due to the continued tightening of foreign exchange and sellers raising prices. Soon, the price soared by $55. Cash gold shops bought ten taels from a certain gold shop, and money exchange businesses bought fifty taels from securities firms, both at $3,675. Later, due to news that foreign exchange had stopped tightening and tended to stabilize, buying intentions waned, and a certain "Quan" firm and securities firms continued to sell, causing the situation to become weak. Before long, the price fell back by $55. Securities firms sold twenty taels to silver shops at $3,620. Around 11 AM, due to news that foreign exchange was trending tighter again, and a certain gold shop stopped selling and started buying, coupled with a certain money exchange business acting as an agent for wealthy individuals to absorb the gold, and Hong Kong merchants also becoming active, the upward trend resumed, soaring by $45. Money exchange businesses bought ten taels from silver shops at $3,665. Later, silver shops sold twenty taels to a certain money exchange business at $3,660, and then sold thirty taels to the money exchange business at $3,650, which was the closing price for the noon session. The afternoon session opened flat. Initially, silver shops sold ten taels to money exchange businesses at $3,649. Subsequently, silver shops sold another twenty taels to money exchange businesses at $3,645. At that time, news suddenly spread from foreign news agencies that the Chinese government was printing a large amount of new banknotes abroad. Simultaneously, foreign exchange reported a tightening and softening trend, further strengthening confidence. Sellers were hoarding goods, and the upward trend intensified. A certain "Quan" firm and money exchange businesses competed to absorb gold, causing the price to soar by $65, breaking through the $3,700 mark. Silver shops sold forty taels to money exchange businesses at $3,710, the highest price of the day. Afterwards, a certain gold shop suddenly sold at the high price, causing the upward trend to falter, immediately falling back within the $3,700 mark. "Ling" firms mutually traded twenty taels at $3,695, the closing price for the evening session. As a result, it soared by $95 compared to the previous day. It was heard that after the closing, silver shops bought thirty taels from a certain silver business, and the price rose again to $3,700. The price fluctuated by $90 throughout the day.

### Securities: Domestic Bonds Slightly Decline, More Foreign Stock Transactions

In the over-the-counter securities market, sellers gradually emerged yesterday, causing market prices to decline sharply. Trading was not active, mainly because there were too few buyers and sellers were unwilling to lower prices, so the downward trend slowed slightly. The current situation may hover between a few dimes and a dollar. Lianhe Firm, which had traditionally been bullish, suddenly changed its style and sold. Songmao, Yongda, and Firm No. 42 followed suit and also sold. Only Firm No. 41, Honglian Hengkang, slightly absorbed the securities. Market prices gradually declined, resulting in a decrease of $0.25 to $0.6. The total value of transactions was around $200,000 to $300,000. A brief summary is listed below:

### Cotton Yarn and Raw Cotton: Chinese and Japanese Factories Actively Purchasing, Cotton Trade Develops, Cotton Merchants Sell Out All Scheduled Cargo

Both domestic and foreign cotton yarn and raw cotton transactions are showing improvement. Chinese and Japanese factories are both showing appetite, hence the market is flourishing. This cotton is all cargo that was previously ordered by the same industry. Foreign telegrams have been received, and both coarse and fine cotton have been loaded onto ships heading to the Far East. They will arrive in Shanghai soon. Cotton merchants, avoiding having to raise funds to pay for the goods upon arrival, took advantage of the factories' activity and sold everything at market price, which was much cheaper than the prices quoted by foreign firms. The factories were also happy to get cheap goods, and the cargo trade became very active. The total number of transactions today was 4,500 bales. Chinese factories purchased 1,850 bales, Japanese factories purchased 200 bales, and the rest were traded among the industry. It is said that most of them were resold to foreign factories. The source from Northern Jiangsu included 55 bales of Tongzhou cotton. The current situation of raw cotton is recorded on the left.

According to another report, foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai have been brisker recently due to looser credit. Japanese factories have low inventories, and the selling price of goods in the hands of the same industry is also more than 20 dollars cheaper than the prices quoted by foreign firms. Therefore, Japanese factories are buying aggressively, and the inventory of the industry is almost exhausted. As inventory decreases, the selling price increases, becoming equal to the prices quoted by foreign firms.

Indian cotton is continuously arriving. It is reported that the British company's regular ship "Carthage," which arrived in Shanghai today from London, carried 457 bales of cotton from Bombay. It docked at Pudong Qichang Warehouse at 5 PM for unloading. Also, the company's "Shirala" ship, managed by Apcar and Company, carried 2,900 bales of cotton from Calcutta. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 6th) at 4 PM and will also dock at Pudong Qichang Warehouse for unloading.

Foreign Cotton Market Prices: When the New York cotton market opened, prices were weak due to reports of declines from Liverpool and Bombay, falling 5 to 8 points. Speculators took profits after the US cotton export subsidy was announced, and hedging activities were triggered. Reports on cotton-growing weather are increasingly favorable. According to private estimates, this year's cotton production will be around 11.5 million bales. Later, new buyers entered the market, and prices rose slightly, resulting in an increase of 1 to 2 points compared to the closing price on the 10th. Indian transport is predicted to rise by more than half a rupee, and Egyptian is predicted to rise by 7 to 8 points.

### Large-Scale Dumping of Japanese Cotton Yarn and Cloth in China Shakes Up the Yarn Market

The price trend of cotton yarn is downward and extremely weak. At the same time, sales to out-of-town merchants are becoming increasingly sluggish. This is because the amount of goods purchased in the past few days has been very large, and demand is temporarily saturated. There may be a period of rest and digestion before further purchases are made. The buying and selling among the same industry is also not as crowded as before, and the activity has slowed down. The market situation has reached a stable state. However, some people still believe that factories do not intend to open yarn, and raw cotton is expensive, so they are still leaning towards a bullish position.

The industry was mostly watching at the beginning of the current yarn session. Out-of-town merchants were also not buying yarn. Mobile brokers were hawking goods in the market and entrusted sales were numerous. It was also heard that Japanese yarn fell 10 dollars at the opening, and the selling cries were particularly loud. The opening price fell by 5 dollars. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn from foreign godowns was 583 dollars, and the price of godown receipts was 570 dollars. At this time, the situation was mediocre. After a while, it was heard that gold had risen slightly, and buying interest increased, rising again by 3-4 dollars. The current price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 587 dollars, and the price of godown receipts was 573 dollars. Afterwards, transactions were not very smooth. By the time of closing, it had fallen by a small amount of 2-3 dollars. In short, the yarn market is still in a state of flux. It was found that the total number of transactions in half a day was 970 bales, and the total number of transactions in the afternoon of the previous day was 250 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 3 dollars, and the closing price fell by 3 dollars. The price of Five Sons fell by 5 dollars. Today, 110 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Siam, and 220 bales were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each trade group is listed as follows:

The Japanese yarn market experienced significant ups and downs. The opening was shaken by reports that Japan was shipping large quantities of cotton yarn and cloth to North and Central China. The price of 20-count Yueqin yarn for this month's delivery suddenly fell by 10 dollars, to 450 dollars. It then rebounded to 456-458 dollars as those who had profited covered their positions. The closing price was only slightly lower than the previous day's price by 2 dollars.

### Food: Rice Prices Slightly Stable

Domi: A small steamer from the Songjiang trade group brought eight boats. From Jing to the Chelin Baozi Nan trade group, there were 1,600 to 1,700 bags. Confidence waned, and the market was exceptionally quiet. There were also few transactions outside the market. Therefore, the prices of thick japonica and other goods outside the market have decreased by about half a dollar, opening at around 23 dollars. The price of high-grade top-quality rice opened at 18.5 to 18 dollars. As for transactions in the market, there were still no samples available for both japonica and top-quality old rice. Only open transactions were done at 16 dollars, rough top-quality rice at 15 dollars, and variable rice at 22 dollars. In terms of appearance, it also fell by 3 to 4 jiao. It is estimated that there were more than 4,000 bags traded inside and outside the market. In short, although the market is chaotic, people are somewhat concerned. Therefore, as soon as the situation eases, everyone watches and waits. If the market remains sluggish today, then the downward trend will be sharp, no less than the upward trend.

Ke Xian: Yesterday morning, after a period of tension, merchants sold at a high price to profit and reduce hoarding. The market immediately loosened. Although there is still no definite news about the opening of production areas, confidence has slightly returned to normal. Selling prices in both the open and black markets were lower by one to two jiao. However, those within the 16-dollar limit are still considered rough. It is said that machine-milled rice is still different by one, two, or three dollars.

Foreign Rice: Yesterday, it was still in the process of being rejected.

Sellers had raised prices by more than one dollar, but although import demand was greedy, it was ultimately too expensive and no transaction was made.

### Flour Soars: Five Dollars and Twenty Cents for Spot Cash on this Street, Six Dollars and Twenty Cents for Out-of-Town Merchant Remittances

Flour: Yesterday, the price of spot flour rose again. The factories were very firm. Therefore, the wholesale price on this street in the morning had been changed to 5 dollars and 1 jiao in cash, an increase of 1 jiao compared to the previous day. It was heard that the price would increase by another 1 jiao in the future. Out-of-town merchants continued to request remittance and the factory also agreed to sell remittances at 6 dollars and 2 jiao. Therefore, from yesterday onwards, there was a distinction between cash and remittance prices for both local and out-of-town merchants. The total number of transactions in the market for all brands of flour was more than 50,000 bags. Apart from more than 10,000 bags sold to local and inland merchants for retail sales, the rest were all purchased by out-of-town merchants.

Wheat: Yesterday, the source of wheat was continuous and the sales were active. Fuxin and Fufeng factories continued to purchase more. The route for hoarders on this street was also not declining. Furthermore, as flour prices soared, those holding goods were all trying to raise prices. The market rose again by 1 to 2 jiao. A total of 20 carts of wheat from Kunshan, Wuxi, Danyang, Nanjing, Qishuyan, Suzhou, Benniu, etc., were sold in the market, at prices ranging from 6 dollars and 7 jiao to 7 dollars and 5 fen. Apart from 13 carts purchased jointly by Fuxin and Fufeng factories, the rest were all purchased by merchants on this street.

### Oilseed Cake: Oil Prices Soar, Dalian Opening Not Realized, Soybean Oil Soars by 1 Dollar and 9 Jiao

Yesterday, the soybean oil market experienced another wave of turmoil. The rumored opening of Dalian in August turned out to be a bubble, causing people to become excited and speculation to become active. Furthermore, today was the Changjiang Rinyin, and the number of transactions increased dramatically. Soybean oil soared by 1 dollar and 8-9 jiao in one day. However, as the source of boxed oil was continuous, the market was stable, only rising by 3-4 jiao yesterday. It is estimated that 150 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were traded, with the price rising from 46 dollars to 47 dollars and 1 jiao. 400 barrels of Kobe-Lian oil were traded, with the price rising from 46 dollars and 5 jiao to 47 dollars and 8 jiao. 50 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were traded at 47 dollars and 5 jiao. 400 cans of Tianjin canned oil were traded at 44 dollars to 44 dollars and 6 jiao. 300 pieces of Jiaozhou boxed oil were traded at 34 dollars. 250 pieces of Qingqi oil were traded at 34 dollars and 4 jiao. 300 pieces of Yanqi oil were traded at 34 dollars and 8 jiao.

On the 5th, 80 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong. On the 4th, 2,000 cans of tung oil were shipped from Tianjin.

### Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Weak

According to foreign reports on yesterday's sugar market, Dutch sugar for September fell slightly to 6.5 guilders. London sugar rose slightly, with December at 6 shillings and 0.25 pence, March of next year at 6 shillings and 1 pence, and June at 6 shillings and 1.5 pence. The local Chamber of Commerce's listed prices for 24 coarse white sugar, spot goods, and re-export goods remained unchanged. Taikoo Car White continued to fall, with Dongzhan B mark at 37 dollars, Xizhan at 37 dollars and 5 jiao, small triangle CW mark at 37 dollars and 3 jiao less 1 jiao, CX mark unchanged at 37 dollars, DY mark at 36 dollars and 5 jiao, and HX mark at 36 dollars and 3 jiao less 3 jiao. Dutch red spot goods were 3 jiao less at 28 dollars and 3 jiao, and re-export goods were 1 jiao less at 21 dollars and 7 jiao. Local cotton white and local ice remained at the original price. Domestic sugar transactions did not take place because the recent clearing has been sparse and the August 13th period is approaching, so merchants do not intend to be greedy.

### Northern and Southern Goods: New Zhangzhou Branches Appear

The first batch of Orchid Bamboo branches and Bird Leaf branches produced in Zhangzhou was shipped to Shanghai the day before yesterday, totaling more than 400 boxes. The harvest was still good. However, transportation from Zhangzhou to Gulangyu is extremely inconvenient due to occasional obstructions from a certain party. With even a slight lack of caution, there is a danger of being confiscated. Therefore, those engaged in this business have some concerns, so it seems difficult for the source to be too prosperous. However, as new Guangdong branches cannot be exported, and Zhangzhou branches can be shipped to Shanghai, they are expected to have a superior advantage.

### Orchid Bamboo Branches Sell for $80

After the first batch of orchid bamboo branches arrived in Shanghai, it was heard that the goods had already been released. As the cost is high, merchants do not seek high profits. Yesterday, selected orchid bamboo branches were sold for $80, and the remaining early red bird leaves were returned.

### Metals: Original Silk and Round Nails Both Rise

The trading of Japanese round nails has been very lively. Tianjin traders have been absorbing large quantities, and building traders and hoarders on this street have also been showing a good appetite, resulting in factories not having enough goods to allocate. The price of original silk and coiled steel (both raw materials for round nails) has risen by 4-5 dollars in recent days. The current market price is 26 dollars, and the price of original silk is 17 dollars. Therefore, the price of round nails has also been driven higher, selling at 27 dollars per barrel, only 1 dollar higher than its raw material (coiled steel). Therefore, some manufacturers are considering suspending operations, and confidence in the market is strong.

### Gardenia Rises by $8-9

Gardenia, in addition to supplying medicinal materials, can also be used as a pigment for all kinds of beverages, so sales are quite good. As Shantou and Jinjiang transportation have been successively blocked, the source has been cut off. The city's inventory is also limited. Yesterday, merchants on this street purchased more than ten pieces, and the selling price rose by 8-9 dollars compared to the past.

### Galangal Almost Reaches a Full Market

The source of galangal has been cut off, and the existing stock is gradually decreasing. Recently, due to the discount rate, confidence has strengthened. Therefore, merchants have tightened their prices and have not sold. It is heard that traders have been showing a strong intention to buy in recent days. The two sides are in negotiations, and the high bid is currently 40 dollars, and it is expected to reach a full market soon.

### Coal: Coal Briquette Factories Need Hongji Shavings

The source of Hongji white coal shavings is not abundant, and the digestion of various coal briquette factories is strong, resulting in the market supply not meeting demand. Furthermore, the general small factories are indirectly ordering goods in a panic. Therefore, the over-the-counter market is quite brisk. The price of Hongji No. 1 shavings has already reached 45 dollars per ton, and the price of No. 2 shavings is 38 dollars. Additional labor is added to the Yangjingbang dock to load cars.

### Statistics: The Advancing Cost of Living: Food and Housing Prices Rise Endlessly

The Shanghai Municipal Council Gazette published the Shanghai Municipal Workers' Cost of Living Index for July of the 18th year of the Republic. Since the beginning of this year, prices have soared and the cost of living index has increased dramatically. The July index reached 188.56, an increase of 12.41 points from the previous month, an increase of 7.05 percent. Compared with the index for the same month last year and the base year (the 25th year of the Republic), it is 20.98 and 88.56 percent higher, respectively. As the cost of living rises, the purchasing power of money decreases accordingly. One yuan in the 25th year of the Republic is now equivalent to 5 jiao 3 fen and 0.3 li.

Classification indexes are also trending upward. The food index increased by 9.56 percent compared to the previous month, fuel increased by 5.58 percent, miscellaneous items increased by 0.46 percent, clothing was generally stable, slightly decreasing by 0.07 percent, and rent increased by 4.67 percent compared to the first half of this year.

### Miscellaneous Talk on Literary Creation

— Sheng Dan

As Mr. Bai Ying said, in the publishing industry over the past year, translations have surpassed general creative works, creating a "prosperous" phenomenon. The translations he listed are naturally not limited to literary works, but include all translations related to economics, law, society, as well as biographies or travelogues.

This phenomenon is certainly gratifying on the one hand, as using other people's cultural food to heal our hunger is not only urgently needed at the moment, but may also be used as a reference in the future. However, on the other hand, it is too pitiful that our own creation is so poor.

In a nutshell, the factor that causes the "prosperity" of translations is the harsh and difficult environment, which hinders creation: Although creators have excellent materials, writing may not be a problem for the time being in today's world where chapters have not been eliminated, but publication will be a problem. Before the "July 7th" Incident, many progressive writers often "closed their mouths" in order to be in line with the national policy at the time and could not express the living reality in their writing. After Mao Dun's "Midnight" was cut off, why didn't translations start to roll up a climax? "Dead Souls," "Mirgorod," and "Outlaws of the Marsh" were all products of that period. The difficulties in the environment of the special region now are ten times greater than in the past. Creators have no better way than to "treasure" the materials. This is the reason for the silence and lack of vitality of creation.

However, having said that, in the Chinese literary world, and only in terms of literature and art, creation has always been very pitiful. Works that can fully express a strong social consciousness and become masterpieces of flesh and blood, such as Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q" and Mao Dun's "Midnight," are actually few and far between. What is the reason for this? In my personal feeling, writers seem to underestimate reality, or simply rely on subjectivity and "close the door to build a car," resulting in the content falling into emptiness. Even if writing skills reach the highest point, it is at best a step towards "art for art's sake," turning literature and art into decorations. Even worse, unnamed writers are kicked out. Editors and publishers form an iron blockade line, making unnamed writers with creative aspirations feel hopeless, and finally retreat in the face of difficulty. Therefore, in these remote twenty-odd years since the "May Fourth" Movement, we have rarely read great literary works. If there are any, they are only the few works such as "The True Story of Ah Q" and "Midnight." This irreparable loss can only be left to history to bear the responsibility.

Finally, Mr. Bai Ying's proposed issue of material processing and theme organization is also worth paying attention to. Having good materials but lacking processing methods, or having good themes but lacking organizational skills, will not produce successful works. As with Pearl Buck's "The Patriot," Chinese literary and art writers can naturally write, and there is no shortage of such materials. However, the problem with some writers is not that they are not good at processing, but that they use their ears instead of their eyes. The success of a scientist is based on experimentation. If literary and artistic creators can write works of flesh and blood, I believe that in addition to processing materials, they should also collect materials from reality and not allow any ideal components to seep into the works. As for the attitude of writing, we must always take not distorting reality as the main condition.

There have been too many materials available for writing in the past two years. After the barriers are removed in the future, I hope that epoch-making works will be produced.

### In the Communication Trench

— Zhang Zhenshan

——A Wartime Comforting Journal

In the height of summer, the intense sunlight blazed across the fields; the universe was silent, stifling, without a trace of sound. Willow branches, thorns, green grass, and wisteria all drooped, dry and shriveled.

On the prairie, we carried heavy loads of comfort goods, moving forward. After passing Yue Long Bang, we turned into the winding communication trench, our pace quickening, sweat dripping onto the dry, hot trench floor, leaving faint damp marks.

Looking out from the prairie, we saw a faint gray smoke rising. As we walked, we hummed the tune of "The Motherland March," remotely echoing the sound of gunfire in the sky.

"Sha...sha sha sha...sha..." Suddenly, a rushing sound swept overhead. Then, less than twenty yards behind us, a shell landed, the soil flying into the sky, a rapidly rising thick smoke condensing high in the air.

No one paid attention to the shell exploding, continuing to stride forward.

After turning past a field, another shell fell not far ahead, damaging the trench surface, the soil collapsing, emitting the smell of gunpowder.

"This is somewhat like a big black bear sighing sideways," a comrade joked with a laugh.

"Get to work, get to work, do it yourselves..." everyone shouted. But when we ran over, ready to start, we found four engineers already at the site, wielding shovels, clearing the pile of mud in the trench. We walked over in surprise, shook their hands, gave them a string of bananas, and continued on our way.

After walking some distance, looking back, the trench surface had been restored to its original state, and the four engineers had suddenly disappeared.

A talkative comrade then opened the floodgates of conversation: On the front lines, one must be quick in action, calm in demeanor, resolute, and composed. They have the instinct to waste bullets, but we have the skill to repair at any time. Shells close to us are useless; will distant ones be effective? They won't cause much damage..."

His words were interrupted by another loud "thump" sound. He looked ahead, opened his mouth, and smiled, saying, "Here it comes again, let's just keep walking, and let it be."

Walking, talking, and laughing, our lips again blew out the tune of "Blood Wash the Rivers and Mountains." The surrounding shell explosions, the faint shouts ahead, the whirring of airplane engines—these sounds became increasingly dense. The sun, the heat wave, the sweat, the thirst, all seemed to have flown out of our senses; the gunfire, the shells, the thick smoke, the warrior's blood flowing on the mud, were flashing and enticing us.

"The front is the trench of the second line of defense; beyond that is the front line. Maybe we'll have a chance to do something?" Captain Li said, raising his hand.

Although the shelling was intense, the trenches of the second line of defense were still quiet and peaceful; rows of soldiers lay prone in silence, gripping their guns; only the sound, like roaring sea waves and erupting volcanoes, coming from the smoke-filled front, banished the loneliness of space.

As we turned out of the communication trench entrance, a battalion commander ran over with several soldiers, humbly and respectfully relieving us of the burdens of the comfort goods, taking them on their shoulders, lightly and quickly, and walking together into the trench of the second line of defense.

Oneself

Knowing oneself, understanding oneself is not easy; conquering oneself, overcoming oneself is even more difficult, if you cannot be true to yourself.

People are accustomed to seeing the splinter in another's eye, but not the beam in their own, as a religious classic says.

Criticizing others, pointing fingers at others, giving others a slap in the face; but, turning around, you slap yourself in the mouth, burning and painful, truly pitiful and laughable. People often lose the mirror that reflects their own souls, which is lamentable.

Our national leader said it well: "Know yourself, examine yourself,鞭策yourself."

Who can? Cannot. Then, you must learn.

### On Makeup

— Yang Yanqi

Having acted in a few plays myself, I deeply know the hardship of makeup. Especially in summer, a face full of greasepaint is more unbearable than being wrapped in heavy fur. But I am not against women wearing makeup. At least because when they wear makeup, the suffering is only theirs, and it has nothing to do with me. On stage, you have to wear makeup; if, contradicting Shakespeare's saying, life is acting, then the makeup of daily life is naturally not surprising.

"Hua" means to change, and "Zhuang" means to adorn. Wearing clothes and hats are also makeup. On stage, whatever role you play, you wear makeup according to the nature of the role; in the human world, if you are a scholar, you have the attire of a scholar. Artists deliberately keep their hair very long, which is not without effort or without considering it, but simply to suit their profession, to add makeup.

In the theater, watching characters act on stage, it is rare not to be deceived by the effect of makeup. Once a person's face is rendered, it naturally changes infinitely, transforming magically. But in all the world, how many people can see through the appearance of makeup and penetrate into the inner soul? Moreover, human intelligence is advancing daily; not only faces can be made up, but even souls and spirits can be made up. After the powder and rouge, no matter how sharp your eyes are, you will only be deceived. The progress of makeup techniques is also advancing daily; it is simply not only advancing daily, but even advancing like a whirlwind.

In the world, the darker the heart, the whiter the face. This is a certain principle. Skin is rough, so a lot of moisturizing cream must be applied; hair is white, and to appear young, it must be dyed black. There is also the logic of dyeing black hair that is not black, and applying yellow powder to yellow skin. The arguments of traitors can also be disguised as bright and grand, and swindlers never wear the mask of a swindler. The scoundrel who is usually the target of public criticism is actually far less bad than others think the good person is. The more brilliant the makeup skills, the deeper the degree of cunning; this is a universal truth, but unfortunately, many people are deceived.

There was a famous beggar in Europe, dressed in tattered clothes, covered in festering sores, old, and extremely pitiful. During the day, he sat on the sidewalk, begging in a sorrowful voice, and most passersby casually threw down a penny or two. But at night, this beggar lived in a mansion, living luxuriously, dressed in gorgeous clothes, not old at all, and without sores; he was just begging and swindling money by means of makeup.

Such things are everywhere, not only swindling money, but also seizing fame, swindling power, swindling faith, and even swindling the country and the masses, all of which are implemented in the human world under the makeup of attitudes, psychology, faces, behaviors, and language.

Looking at it this way, who can not wear makeup?

In the sweltering heat, women's faces must feel uncomfortable. I am not against the use of greasepaint. If personality and character are wrapped in red and white greasepaint, then what is there to say about the skin of the face?

### Impressions of the Wilderness

— Li Ren

After the Sino-French Drama Society's performance of "The True Story of Ah Q" received rave reviews, they followed up with "The Wilderness."

This is a tragedy. Although the plot is simple, the handling is quite difficult.

The story is like this: Chou Hu, whose father was killed by Jiao Yanwang and who was framed and imprisoned for eight years, escapes from prison to seek revenge. But Jiao Yanwang has already died, leaving behind only his son, Daxing, and Daxing's blind mother. Daxing has a second wife, Jinzi, who was formerly Chou Hu's lover. When she sees Chou Hu this time, she is pleasantly surprised. However, Daxing's blind mother learns of this. She tells her son Daxing to report the fugitive. Chou Hu then kills Daxing; she wants to take revenge but mistakenly kills her grandson. Chou Hu and Jinzi flee into the wilderness and are surrounded by the local detectives. They commit suicide by slitting their throats.

The director is Shu Shi, who also plays the male lead, Chou Hu. He is an experienced actor. Overall, he is satisfying, but in some places, his spirit is not very focused, and he seems a little lax. Zhou Manhua plays Jinzi. Her lines are fluent and loud, and her movements and expressions are deeply moving. She is the one who leaves the deepest impression on the audience. Qiao Qi's Daxing is better in the second half than in the first. The first half is a little dull, which does not create unity. Meng Na's Jiao Shi is very capable of portraying a fierce, stubborn, and narrow-minded old woman. She is consistent from beginning to end, which is not easy to do.

The other actors are also competent.

The sound effects and set design all coordinate with the development of the plot, such as the roar of the wind, the chirping of two turtle doves. All can make the audience deeply appreciate the plot. The sets are all good, but only scenes two and three seem too cramped and crowded. It would be best to move the chair in the middle of the stage to the empty left side, and the small table next to the shrine could also be removed, which might make it more harmonious.

### Memories and Thoughts on Acting (Part 2)

— Recorded by Leng Fang

——A Conversation with Ms. Tan Ying

This film was only a guest appearance at the time. Later, when Lianhua Film Company was founded, they invited me to sign a long-term contract for three years. Only then did I leave school life and formally step into the film industry. However, I have been living this life in a confused way for eight years, and I feel ashamed to think that I have accomplished nothing!

My thoughts on acting: I think an actor's life should be complex, with a lot of stimulation, so that they can laugh and cry often and be experienced, so that they can act wonderfully and with strength. If they live in luxury, living in high-rise buildings and growing white and fat, without any experience of life, it is impossible for them to act well for the rest of their lives. In addition, if an actress wants to make money solely by selling youth, then her life will naturally be very short and difficult to last. But true performing arts are eternal, because as they get older, they can play older roles. If they don't know they are old when they are old, then they will truly become old monsters and inevitably isolate themselves from the audience. Now, I am only twenty-five years old, but my heart is as still as water, and I feel very old. For example, in the recent film "Lust Demon," I played a naive and innocent little girl with braids. Although the director said that I played the role well, I was only forced to do so, and I always felt very embarrassed.

Art is eternal! I want to work harder on this. But the future is uncertain, and it is not easy to predict. I believe that one can only rely on one's own ability to strive forward. As for the results of the struggle, that is another question that does not need much thought.

Dance World Sketches (34)
— Xiao Tian

### Star Six Star Chronicle Six — Rong Feifei

Anyone who travels around the metropolis has probably seen a dance star called Fang Lili. Her dance skills are no less than Jin Lili's, and her social skills are also good. She left for Hong Kong last week. When she left, many of her fellow sisters went to the ship to see her off. One of them, Fang Lili, even hugged her and cried loudly, even more sadly than a blood relative, which surprised the other people who were seeing her off. Do you know the reason? A disciple asked me, and I couldn't guess. A day later, she told me the truth. I am a straightforward person, so I won't let you suffer. Let me write it out quickly.

Before the August 13th Incident, Fang Lili met a close friend, and after a while, she inevitably became pregnant. Just at the moment when the war clouds were urgent, the little citizen in her womb was also eager to be born. Unexpectedly, the little citizen's father suddenly felt ashamed to be a father and refused to leave his house. When Fang Lili was a dancer, she only spent money as it came and went, and she had no savings. At that time, a production fee became a problem. She couldn't find her close friend, and the dance halls were closing one after another due to the impact of the situation. Her fellow sisters had no income from dance tickets and were all taking care of themselves, so naturally, they couldn't ask for loans. As the saying goes, heaven never bars one's way. Just when she was so anxious that she had no way to go to heaven and no door to enter the earth, suddenly a living benevolent Bodhisattva came down from Hui Mountain, took out some clothes and ornaments that she had saved, pawned them for two hundred yuan, and gave them all to her. She also comforted her and said, "The dance hall has opened. I borrowed this from the accounting room first. Later, when you dance, you can continue to receive money." Because of this, Fang Lili was able to get through the difficult time safely. You want to know where this living Bodhisattva lives and what her name is? Let me sing a few lines of opera lyrics for her: "Without opening her mouth, she smiles, respectfully listening to the details, her hometown is Rong Lane in Wuxi, Rong Feifei is the name of the servant; only because her family has suffered misfortune, she has therefore learned the art of being a dance star." Alas! In this era, this kind of enthusiastic and righteous friend is not easy to find. If you want to visit her, please go to Dahua Tea Dance once.

(Top picture) Bu Tailan and Bei Si laugh at each other. This is the rich harvest of the god of love.

### Peach and Plum Tribulation

— Qi Hua

“BcCk Road To Heaven”

The playwright of "Peach and Plum Tribulation" raised such a valuable question: the evils caused by a bad environment and the tragedies caused by an irrational society. He placed sympathy and sighs on the young Frank, and left "whose fault is it" on the heart of every audience, making people think deeply.

The writing of the script was carefully considered. For example, on graduation day, the teacher ordered each student to show a skill to show their interest in seeking further study in the future, to contrast with Frank, who stole the harmonica and eventually committed a crime and went to jail. It should be an excellent educational film.

But this good script completely failed in its performance. First: the tone of the whole film is too slow, and the center of gravity is not deep enough, and it loses its power. For example, in the later development of each student after graduation, the director did not grasp the strong contrast that the playwright gave to the audience's hearts. Second: he did not concentrate all his efforts on Frank, clearly portraying his process of falling, but let the horizontal development destroy the sublimation of emotions. Third: the editing is chaotic, such as after Frank escapes from prison in the end, he also writes about the alumni meeting, and only after Frank has escaped far away does he connect a shot of a police car chasing him. The scene where Frank says goodbye to his classmates and teachers is indeed the most moving scene in this film, and the grasp of the mood and atmosphere is strong enough, but the carelessness of the editing reveals a conflict in time.

A mediocre director is a great loss to actors, and can also destroy a good script. The tragic failure of "Peach and Plum Tribulation" is a great pity.

### Brief Art News

The Soviet film "Pugachev" is now showing at the Huiguang Grand Theater. The story of this film is tragic and the scenes are grand. It is said that ticket sales are very good.

The Yixing Amateur Drama Club will hold its first public performance on the 6th at the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Countrymen Association. The scripts include "New Father", "Dawn", "In the Shikumen" and "Four College Students". The directors are Song Chao, Ma Ling, Chen Mingxun, etc.

### Mei Lin Leaves the Film Industry

— Bu Zhi

For two years, the film industry has lacked the activities of Mei Lin. No, judging from Mei Lin's current living environment, perhaps, perhaps her light-hearted smiling shadow will never be reflected on the screen again.

The reason is: Mei Lin wants to gradually dilute and even eliminate everything about her in the audience's minds because of certain problems and relationships. Summer has arrived, and now, the black cannon car is carrying Mei Lin flying along the wide Edward Road. With him protecting her, her spirit appears more radiant and happier than before. The thin material of her clothing, the new-style sanction of 1339, sets off her slender figure, and the sound of her high-heeled leather shoes is so crisp and loud.

Most people know that Mei Lin is Mei Lin, but they don't understand that Mei Lin's original surname and name is Pan Zhaolin. At that time, she changed her name because she was afraid that her parents would object to her entering the film industry. She is from Shanghai and used to study at Moore Hall English School. Mei Lin is beautiful, so when Ruan Lingyu passed away, she was given the nickname of Sai Ruan Lingyu. But Mei Lin's innocence is more likely to attract the attention of the audience than her beauty.
