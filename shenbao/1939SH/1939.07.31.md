Observations by Foreign Affairs Observers

### Japan Plans a New General Offensive on Various Fronts in China, Xi'an, Yichang, and Nanning to be the Target of the Offensive, Fresh Army Divisions Gathered, Success or Failure Depends on This One Move

(Chongqing) According to foreign military observers speaking to the Associated Press, the Japanese army seems to be planning another decisive offensive against various Chinese fronts in September, in an attempt to end the war. The primary targets of the offensive are Xi'an in Shaanxi, Yichang in Hubei, and Nanning in Guangxi. The scale of the offensive will be comparable to the Japanese army's previous offensives against Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Wuhan. To carry out this new general offensive, the Japanese plan to transfer seven to ten fresh army divisions from Japan to China. It is also reported that since the start of the Japanese invasion of China, the Japanese army in China has lost 60% of its strength. According to the foreign military observer, the success or failure of the Japanese military depends on this one move. (30th Associated Press telegram)

### Chinese Army Denies Using Poison Gas

(Chongqing) According to a spokesman for the General Headquarters Military Affairs Department today, Tokyo's broadcast on July 27 claiming that the Chinese army used poison gas is a baseless fabrication and not worthy of laughter. The so-called document obtained by the Japanese as evidence is nothing more than a document abandoned by Japanese soldiers. Furthermore, China's current war of resistance against Japan is purely for justice, so why should we adopt such brutal and cruel war methods? (30th Associated Press telegram)

### Japanese Attempt to Invade Westward in Xinyang and Minggang Area Foiled, Japanese Troops in Guxian Town Have Already Retreated, Chinese Army is Searching and Advancing

Nanyang The Japanese army's westward invasion of the Xinyang and Minggang area has been shattered by the Chinese army. The area north of Minggang has been cleared, and the area west of the Shige River has also been repelled by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops in Guxian Town and other places, under the pressure of the fresh Chinese forces, have also retreated. Currently, the Chinese army is searching and advancing, while a unit of the Japanese army is still entrenched at Huaihe Dian on the Nanxin Highway. (29th telegram)

(Luoyang) The situation in southern Henan is still undergoing intense fighting. Observing the Japanese operational plan, it belongs to a three-pronged westward invasion: one from northwest of Minggang towards Biyang, one from San Guan Miao west through Wang Gang Maoji towards Huanggang Biyang, and one directly from Xinyang towards Tongbai, with the intention of capturing Guxian and Maoji southwest of Gu Xian as strongholds to support the two-pronged war. After the Chinese forces intercepted on all routes, the Japanese only occupied Wang Gang (west of Minggang) in the first route, and have been unable to advance to this day. The Japanese army in the second route once captured Huanggang, but was ambushed by the Chinese army from both sides, and most of them retreated to Maoji. On the evening of the 28th, more than 600 Japanese soldiers returned to Minggang. The Japanese army in the third route captured Ganhe Dian (east of Tongbai) on the 28th and is now engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army. The Japanese troops that invaded north once captured Li Xin Dian, but were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army and have retreated back to Minggang. Currently, the main Chinese forces are advancing and counterattacking in separate routes, and a new situation is expected to unfold within the next few days. (29th telegram)

Nanyang A phone call from Tongbai this morning stated that the Japanese troops in the Minggang and Xinyang area have invaded westward in two groups. The Japanese troops along the Xin-Nan Highway are invading villages such as Liuzhuang in Guxian Town, setting fires and destroying a large number of houses. The Japanese troops invading west from Minggang consist of 3,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry, more than 100 trucks, and over 10 tanks, have crossed the Huai River and invaded Wucheng Town. The county troops from Hua, Biyang and Tongbai have gathered to prepare for a fierce battle. (28th telegram)

Fancheng The more than 2,000 Japanese troops invading west from Minggang were forced to retreat to Minggang on the 29th after being attacked by the Chinese army in multiple directions. Currently, Maoji Lantang near the front of Guxian Town, southwest of Minggang, are controlled by the Chinese side. At the same time, the Chinese army is advancing step by step, forming a pincer-shaped encirclement to compress the Japanese army. (30th telegram)

(Luoyang) The Chinese army has been counterattacking in southern Henan for days and has been gaining ground. The main forces have been reporting frequent victories everywhere. In summary, the Japanese troops who invaded west in three routes have suffered serious blows. The Japanese troops who captured Wagang in the north have already returned to Minggang. The Japanese troops in Maoji in the central route have been desperately intercepted by the Chinese and have also collapsed eastward in a sorry state. There are no traces of the Japanese west of Landian (west of Minggang). The Japanese troops in Yuehe Dian (east of Tongbai) in the south were more rampant, but after the Chinese troops and local forces led by Hua forces surrounded and attacked from all sides, most of them also collapsed. The brave soldiers from various Chinese routes in Wujia Dian (west of Xinyang) are pursuing their victory. (30th telegram)

He deeply appreciated the patriotism of this overseas Chinese compatriot, which is enough to set an example and serve as a model. He sent a special telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be forwarded to the Consulate in Kuala Lumpur, conveying his commendation. (30th telegram)

### Fourth Company Commander Heroically Sacrifices His Life

(Chongqing) On the 21st of last month, Yuan Zhizhong, Liu Deshan, Li Kun, and Li Xuanting, company commanders of a certain unit in the ×th War Zone, were ordered to rush to support the troops amidst heavy rain and muddy conditions. At Xiajiashan, they engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army all day long. Although Yuan and others were seriously injured, they still held their positions and launched brave attacks, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese army. The next morning, the Japanese army reinforced and counterattacked, and they continued to engage in hand-to-hand combat, leading to their heroic sacrifice. Among them, Liu Deshan was the most heroic. During hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army, he was shot seven times but still stood up and fought bravely, taking on ten men at once. When his bodyguard, Hou Qingshan, went to rescue him, Liu firmly refused to retreat, saying, "I am seriously injured and cannot survive even if I retreat." He then heroically sacrificed himself in this battle. After receiving the report, the commander of the unit stated that the sacrifice of the company commanders was heroic and could serve as an example for the entire army. He specially reported it to the Ministry and requested posthumous compensation in accordance with the law. It is said that the highest authorities will commend him to publicize his heroism.

Editorial

### International Developments Underway

The Sino-Japanese war, the situation in the Far East, and even the general international welfare and security, are all entering a critical period of development in the short term.

We do not want to speak presumptuously about the conclusion of the developments we believe in. Moreover, after these developments, the situation may become even more dire on one or more fronts due to retrograde actions. However, the current developments do have the potential to produce good results, and provide an opportunity to pursue good results. How things ultimately turn out depends on the efforts of rational individuals around the world. What we want to emphasize is that we hope that rational individuals from all countries in the world will respond to each other's calls and work together on the basis of common and fair principles!

What are these common and fair principles? Some may think it is a particular ideology, believing that the world will be united as one family if a single ideology is practiced everywhere. This is a foolish fantasy that will never come true. Let's not talk about the different doctrines of communism, national socialism, and fascism, which can only be allowed to live and die within their own tribes, and at most, slightly influence the surrounding areas. Let's not talk about the incompatibility of communism with national socialism and fascism. Even national socialism and fascism cannot unite Germany and Italy into one country. As for democracy, we adhere to it and sincerely support it as the orthodox political system and thought of civilized mankind. However, why should we eliminate "heresy" with democracy? Therefore, using ideology as a rallying cry, or using "anti-" a certain ideology as a rallying cry, are not common and fair principles. This is one point. Others believe it is peace, arguing that peace is a common aspiration of mankind, and justice will prevail under peace. This is either a hypothetical ideal of anarchism or a hypothetical ideal of militarism. Because peace has its indispensable conditions. Anarchists assume that the causes of non-peace have been completely eliminated, while militarists assume that the opposing forces will eventually be completely eliminated. Is this possible? The key condition for peace is justice. Seeking peace without justice only results in the sacrifice of Czechoslovakia for peace, without seeing the protection of justice by the United Kingdom. Japan's unjust aggression destroyed peace. China's resistance to injustice and war is not reckless for peace. Therefore, to speak of peace without regard for everything is by no means a common and fair principle of mankind. This is the second point. These two are used by the cunning, confused, violent, and cowardly elements of the international community, each taking what is convenient for them as a banner, and they are all wrong.

What are the common and fair principles of the international community? To put it simply: Each country should uphold the integrity of its sovereignty, territory, and administration, respect the integrity of other countries' sovereignty, territory, and administration, and assist other countries in maintaining the integrity of their sovereignty, territory, and administration. That's all, that's all. All international actions that conform to this goal are extremely right and proper, and those that violate this goal are extremely wrong and absurd. Cooperate and strive for what is extremely right and proper, and cooperate and strive to correct what is extremely wrong and absurd. This is what rational individuals from all countries in the world should overcome all difficulties, prepare for sacrifice and pain, and devote all their efforts to achieve. Why are we so leisurely discussing these old sayings? Because these common and fair principles are inherently reasonable and indestructible. However, some people deliberately destroy them, some people ignore them because of their ignorance, some people condone and indulge them for the sake of short-term and petty gains, and some people are intimidated by violence and accustomed to pleasure and dare not face this goal squarely. There are also those who, based on population, economy, or a certain page or fragment of history, or a certain exaggerated traditional myth, claim that the sovereignty, territory, and administration of other countries should be destroyed, reduced, or changed. This is either sophistry or delusion, because sovereignty, territory, and administration have a definite definition, a clear fact, and a clear scope. What they use as a basis has no standards and only serves to cover up their ambitions. If population, economy, etc., are problems in themselves that need to be solved, then they should also be solved fairly under the integrity of sovereignty, territory, and administration. Delusions deceive oneself and others, and sophistry deceives oneself and others, while international disputes are reflected in them. Can old sayings be stopped?

Observing today's international phenomena: Apart from the war between China and Japan, which is a concrete action that determines the future and which China is irretrievably committed to, which needs no discussion, in addition, (1) the United States is clear, strong, and resolute, and has recently made a preliminary expression that conforms to the aforementioned common and fair principles. We firmly believe that the United States will follow this path and develop and strengthen the aforementioned principles, establishing them as a permanent and solid foundation for the international community. However, this preliminary expression is by no means the end. There is a great distance between the preliminary stage and the completion of the process. To shorten the distance in space, it is necessary to follow up with effective actions. To shorten the distance in time, it is necessary to act swiftly and decisively. How will the United States act? When will the United States act? There are rumors that the U.S. authorities are observing the changing times and will decide on the next steps. One is to observe domestic public opinion, the second is to observe the Japanese reaction, and the third is to observe the evolution of the European situation. It is necessary to be prudent and deliberate in planning the country, but a country that is in a leading position in the international community and has the power to influence the situation must attach importance to taking the initiative in developing strategies. If it delays too much, or if its hesitation and lack of resolve are misunderstood, or if its preliminary expression is misunderstood as empty threats, then its observation will be excessive. (2) The United Kingdom is making efforts in Tokyo and Moscow. Regarding the negotiations in Moscow, we sympathize with the United Kingdom's efforts to compromise, but if the former Prime Minister Lloyd George is still attacking Chamberlain for this, then there must be some incomprehensible inside story? What is this inside story that has been developing for so long! As for the negotiations in Tokyo, the previous preliminary agreement may have had justifiable circumstances, but its actions were absolutely unforgivable. International affairs are related to reality and must involve interests, so one must discuss actions and not emotions. Whoever has grudges and prejudices will be praised as a friend, otherwise they will be rejected and abandoned. Therefore, one must not make any concessions. The worldwide condemnation of the preliminary agreement was self-inflicted. However, the British attitude that has been reported over the past 113 days has been quite tough and will be praised by the world. However, as of now, things are not yet certain. Will the British diplomatic outpost in Tokyo fight unyieldingly for Far Eastern interests and the common and fair principles of the international community? Or will it give up its interests, violate principles, cut itself off from 450 million friendly people, and retreat to Singapore? This will become clear in the short term. Before this is clear, even the friendliest countries to the United Kingdom can only objectively argue that the choice of action is still developing. (3) Japan aspires to dominate the Far East, but lacks justification and power. However, in today's disputes, its decision-making mechanism can still be manipulated and utilized, unlike China, which is forced to resist and strive for survival. From the perspective of common and fair international principles, Japan has no justification and should retreat. However, Japanese-style thought and theory, due to education and traditional attitudes, seem to have never understood this principle. China's resolute resistance has failed to enlighten their understanding. Although countries have shown moral aversion, they have not stopped economic and political exchanges, and they have not stopped tolerating and enduring their violence. This has blocked their due understanding. Therefore, Japan's deep-rooted deviance is not only their own fault but also the fault of other countries. Even today, we would still present new evidence if Japan could humbly accept the above principles and change its course. However, the clear and strong preliminary expression of the United States is at least enough to make Japan realize that the United States cannot tolerate Japan's actions. It is said that Reuters' Tokyo dispatch recently stated that Japan's long-standing misunderstanding of the United States has been shattered by this, which must be true. Following the preliminary expression of the United States, American public opinion has transcended partisan disputes and praised the government, which shows national unity. World public opinion has praised the United States in unison, which shows global unity. The British attitude is said to be hardening, which shows Anglo-American unity. The economic and political exchanges that countries have had with Japan for years will no longer be the same. Japan's decision-making mechanism can still be manipulated and utilized. Should it not take this opportunity to change course and preserve its remaining strength and its international standing? Should it not graciously withdraw and reconcile with 450 million people under the common and fair principles of the international community? Or should it wait for other opportunities for international deterioration and seek good fortune? Or should it go its own way, be willing to fight against all countries, and ultimately destroy its remaining strength and plunge itself into an irrecoverable abyss? We dare not expect Japan to quickly conform to common sense and reason, but in today's environment, rational individuals in Japan should take this as an opportunity to restrain their sharp edges, change their course, and strive to develop a new policy shift. After all, Japan is not comparable to China, which is forced to resist and has no choice but to fight.

### Encouraged by the US Abolishing Treaty, the UK Adopts a Stronger Stance Towards Japan: Demands the Lifting of the Blockade and the Cessation of Anti-British Activities; Tianjin Case Round Table Conference Continues Today

(London) News from here last night: British Foreign Secretary Halifax has issued new instructions to the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, questioning Japan's instigation of anti-British movements in the Far East, and demanding that the Japanese authorities lift the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin. When representatives from both sides resume negotiations on the Tianjin case tomorrow, the British Ambassador will, in accordance with the new instructions, demand that the Japanese side cease anti-British movements and lift the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin. As for the new instructions issued by Foreign Secretary Halifax, there was speculation last night regarding whether it included a threat of breaking off negotiations with Japan. However, at a minimum, the British Ambassador will inform the Japanese side that the continuation of anti-British movements and the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin will affect subsequent negotiations in Tokyo. Diplomatic circles here believe that the UK's new move is due to the US's tougher stance towards Japan. It is reported that the Washington government announced last week the abolition of the 1911 US-Japan commercial treaty. (Reuters, 30th)

(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Arita met with the Japanese Emperor yesterday afternoon to report on the progress of the Tokyo Conference. (Reuters, 30th)

(Tokyo) Prior to the sixth UK-Japan talks to be held tomorrow, the "Economic Situation Investigation Committee" will meet at 9:00 am at the official residence of the Foreign Affairs Ministry. Those attending include Mr. Tanaka, Mr. Asami, and Mr. Aoki, all three ministry officials, as well as Mr. Macrae, the British Commercial Counselor to Japan, and Mr. Harvard, a consul. They will discuss the issue of transferring legal tender and silver based on concrete facts. The Japanese side will do its utmost to explain that if this issue cannot be resolved in reality, the maintenance of public order in North China and the survival of the Japanese army will not be secured, in order to promote British recognition. The sixth talks will begin at 4:00 pm. Furthermore, Mr. Dinnis, the Chief of the Tianjin Municipal Police Department, arrived in Tokyo yesterday evening after being summoned by Ambassador Craigie, bringing with him local data regarding the details of decisions reserved in the public order issue. Therefore, before discussing economic issues, the details of the security and police issues may be reviewed first in order to finalize the issue. If the discussion involves economic issues, it will likely be based on the deliberations of the morning subcommittee to find a way to resolve the theoretical conflicts in the previous talks. (Domei News Agency, 30th)

### Canada's Trade Surplus with Japan; Willing to Sacrifice Interests if UK Declares Abolition of Treaty

Ottawa: While local newspapers fully support the US's announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty, business figures deeply fear that if the Tokyo talks between the UK and Japan are unsuccessful, the UK may follow the US and declare the abolition of the UK-Japan commercial treaty, which is not without concern. In the past three years, Canada has sold goods worth 80 million Canadian dollars to Japan, mainly metals used for manufacturing armaments, while its imports from Japan are only worth 25 million Canadian dollars, resulting in a large trade surplus. The Canadian government is under pressure from public opinion to refuse to prohibit the shipment of raw materials for manufacturing armaments to Japan, which is also the reason. The government argues that prohibiting the shipment of raw materials to Japan will be ineffective without cooperation from other countries, especially the US. However, according to the Montreal Daily News, if the UK-Japan commercial treaty is abolished, Canada's trade with Japan will automatically cease. (Havas, 29th)

### Sassoon Arrives in America

Newark, New Jersey: Sir Victor Sassoon, a Shanghai tycoon, arrived here yesterday from San Francisco, refusing to reveal his mission and purpose in coming to the US, and refusing to talk about the situation in China. Sir Sassoon is travelling to New York from here. Sir Victor Sassoon's decision to come to the US has aroused much speculation here, as he only said he was going to Honolulu when he left Shanghai. (Associated Press, 30th)

Three Chinese Organizations Cable British Prime Minister, Urging Him to Stop Tokyo Talks; Also Cable US President, Congratulating Him on Abolishing the US-Japan Commercial Treaty

(Chongqing) According to sources in charge here today, seven organizations, including the Sino-British Cultural Association, the Sino-American Cultural Association, the Sino-French-Belgian and Swiss Cultural Association, the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, the China League of Nations Association, the Chinese People's Foreign Affairs Association, and the Chinese Branch of the International Peace Movement, held a joint meeting yesterday to discuss the UK-Japan conference and the US's abolition of the commercial treaty with Japan. As a result, it was decided to cable British Prime Minister Chamberlain, urging him to (1) stop the Tokyo talks, and (2) take action parallel to that of the US. At the same time, it was planned to cable President Roosevelt, congratulating him on his decision to abolish the US-Japan Commercial and Navigation Treaty. All the above cables were drafted at the meeting and are now being sent to the leaders of each organization for signature. It is expected that they will be sent to London and Washington today. The British chairman of the Sino-British Cultural Association is the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, and the Chinese chairman is former Minister of Education Wang Shijie. (Reuters, 30th)

(Chongqing) Currently, due to concerns from various parties regarding the involvement of cultural associations in political events, according to reliable sources, the cables to Chamberlain and Roosevelt will only be signed by three organizations, including the Chinese Branch of the International Peace Movement, and the four cultural associations will not participate. The Chinese Branch of the International Peace Movement has approximately 200,000 members. (Reuters, 30th)

(Chongqing) This morning, Chinese-language newspapers here expressed great concern about the future of the UK-Japan Conference. It is said that Chinese people, in view of the past friendship and cooperation between China and the UK, cannot help but feel disappointed with this Tokyo plan. Although the British side has repeatedly stated that the Tokyo plan does not contain any changes in the UK's policy towards China, the Chinese people still feel deeply concerned about the progress of the Tokyo talks. The newspaper also stated that Japan is currently promoting the smooth progress of the Tokyo Conference on the one hand, while expanding anti-British riots on the other. Therefore, the Tokyo Conference will have no compromise solution except for complete surrender by the UK. The Chinese authorities and public organizations are now considering how to advise the UK to stop the Tokyo talks immediately, not to mediate with Japan, and to adopt parallel actions with the US, as well as a strict and resolute policy to deal with Japan. This matter is under thorough consideration by the Chinese authorities and public organizations, and its final decision will be noteworthy. (Reuters, 30th)

(Chongqing) The United Daily News here published an article today entitled "Prospects After the Abolition of the US-Japan Treaty," stating that the US's position in the Far East is very different from that of the UK and France, because the UK and France are both located in Europe, while the US is a Pacific nation. The US occupies the position of leader of the Pacific nations, and no one has ever argued with it due to historical and geographical relations. The article concluded by saying that now is a good opportunity for the US to take active measures to prevent Japan's aggression in the Far East. (Reuters, 30th)

### Utilizing Economic Weapons Sufficient to Force Japan to Submit; British Newspaper Praises Roosevelt's Great Achievements; Urges UK, US, and Soviet Union to Cooperate Effectively

(London) The Times commented on the US's announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty, stating, "American public opinion has always sympathized with China's resistance and has been hostile to Japanese aggression. However, in the past two years, it has strictly adhered to a policy of non-intervention. This sudden change in attitude is probably due to the fact that American residents in North China have also been insulted by Japanese soldiers. The US has always attached great importance to attacks on its own people, and is not constrained by the threat of war like European countries, so it can calmly take action. This shows that the US is unwilling to sit idly by and watch the power of Western countries in China be completely excluded. The UK may be able to follow suit under certain circumstances, but it is not certain that the US is willing to cooperate with the UK to protect the common interests of both sides and prevent Japan from harming them." The Observer enthusiastically praised President Roosevelt, saying that the abolition of the treaty "is one of the greatest achievements of the President's life. His decision was well-thought-out and supported by the public, which has shown Japan that the US's patience also has its limits. The President is not only courageous, but also tactful, and did not notify the UK and France in advance, which is sufficient to prove his spirit of observing the Constitution. It is imaginable that Tokyo heard it like thunder." In our country, for the Far East issue, we should follow the US in both commercial and political aspects, and then find ways to make the negotiations between the UK, France, and the Soviet Union successful. If our country cooperates effectively with the US and the Soviet Union, it will be able to contain Japan and prevent China from being conquered. (Havas, 29th)

(London) The Observer's diplomatic correspondent wrote an editorial yesterday, saying that the British diplomatic community today recognizes that the US's abolition of the commercial treaty with Japan is not only crucial in US-Japan relations, but also has a great impact on the possibility of the UK deciding to take the same step, and acknowledges that the economic weapons of the two countries have immeasurable value compared to what one country alone can hope for. While the meeting on the Tianjin incident is in progress, there cannot immediately be a question of the UK following the US, but the possibility of the UK taking such a step in the future is now a factor in the Far Eastern situation, and it is expected to have an impact on the Tokyo Conference itself.

### Japanese University Professors Worry About National Fate; Jointly Appeal to US; Ask Them to Consider Old Friendship

(Tokyo) The Federation of Japanese University Professors held a meeting here yesterday and passed a resolution asking the US government to carefully consider its abrupt unilateral action of abolishing the US-Japan commercial treaty. The resolution was delivered to the US authorities in Tokyo by Professor Negishi of St. Paul's University and Professor Komatsu of Nihon University, representing the Federation. The resolution stated: "In view of the friendly relations between Japan and the US in the past eighty years, the unilateral act of your government announcing the abolition of the commercial treaty is regrettable. The Federation of Japanese University Professors hereby requests your country to give this matter careful consideration." (Reuters, 30th)

### Japanese Military Attaché to Soviet Union Declines Invitation to Farewell Banquet; Briefly Vents Resentment

(Moscow) Diplomatic circles here are commenting today on the fact that five Japanese army attachés refused to attend a farewell reception for Major Shea, the US army attaché, last night. However, according to the Japanese army attaché, there was "another meeting" when they accepted the invitation. Diplomatic circles here pointed out that last night's incident was related to the Washington government's abolition of the 1911 US-Japan commercial treaty last week. Others believed that the Japanese army attaché was retaliating for an incident a few weeks ago, when Major Shea and British air force attaché Howell left the Japanese embassy without waiting for the screening of a newsreel showing Japanese planes bombing Chinese cities to finish.

### British and American Strategies Towards Japan; Must Have Been Contacted in Advance; Observations of Roman Newspaper

(Rome) Italian newspapers have been commenting on the US government's announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty, mostly following the line of argument held by the Italian Daily yesterday, accusing the UK and the US of colluding, saying that President Roosevelt had subtly consulted the British government before abolishing the treaty, and that the UK's submission to Japan a few days ago was only superficial. The Fascist Labor News stated, "The UK has been encouraged by the US's abolition of the treaty and is preparing to participate in anti-Japanese economic measures. This is actually a crusade against totalitarian states, led by President Roosevelt. The UK has now discarded its mask, so it is not an exaggeration to say that the country is not sincere in holding talks with Japan." The Evening Post stated, "The US's move is a political expression and clearly has hostile intentions towards Japan, but the major democracies may not benefit from it. President Roosevelt probably wants to show the UK how to take a tough stance in the Far East. However, the will of the totalitarian countries is strong and their understanding is firm and unparalleled. President Roosevelt's family and several confidants want to see him step down, so they are using this kind of provocative strategy, hoping that he will cling to power because of it, but it will only harm himself. This is what President Roosevelt should know." (Havas, 29th)

### Defending Against Aggression is Interdependent; Soviet Union Decides to Continue Aiding China; Promises Large Loan for Purchase of Armaments; Sun Ke Negotiates in Moscow

(Moscow) Regarding the Soviet Union's granting of a commercial credit loan of 750 million rubles to China, informed sources here said they had no knowledge of it, but the Soviet Union is currently continuing to provide China with substantial assistance, which is beyond doubt after the visit of Sun Ke, President of the Chinese Legislative Yuan. This is also evident from the statement made by Soviet People's Commissar and Foreign Minister Molotov in the Soviet Supreme Soviet. Authoritative observers say that China's heroic resistance has achieved unexpected results, and Japan has therefore failed to attack the Soviet Far Eastern border in the autumn of 1937. The Soviet Union considers it beneficial to continue to aid China, and its financial assistance will take the form of credit loans to enable China to purchase armaments from the Soviet Union.

### Important Changes to Commanders of Far Eastern Red Army; Rumors of Blücher's Reinstatement

(Moscow) The Soviet government recently issued an order stating that General Stern, Commander-in-Chief of the Far Eastern Red Army, has been assigned to another post, and the vacancy will be filled by Chief of Staff General Popov. General Stern was originally Chief of Staff to General Blücher, and had made outstanding contributions in the Changkufeng Incident last year, and had been awarded the Order of Lenin. Observers are surprised by the reason for his dismissal. (Havas, 29th)

Warsaw: According to reliable sources from Moscow in the "Warsaw Times," a Soviet-Japanese war is likely to break out in the near future. The recent major changes in the commanding generals of the Soviet Far Eastern Red Army, as well as the issue of General Blücher's reinstatement, are related to the development of this matter. The newspaper continued to say that after the dismissal of General Stern, commander of the First Special Army of the Soviet Far East, many of his subordinates and personnel from the political department of the Far Eastern Red Army were arrested by the authorities because they had falsely accused General Blücher of baseless crimes, which weakened the combat effectiveness of the Far Eastern Red Army. It is said that the Soviet administrative authorities are now trying to exonerate General Blücher, restore his position, and revitalize the military discipline and war spirit of the Far Eastern Army.

### North Sakhalin Island Oil Rights Dispute; Soviet Union Has Not Enforced Seizure; Negotiations are in Progress

(Moscow) The Soviet government notified the Japanese Embassy last night that if the Japanese side concludes an agreement with the Soviet Union recognizing that the Japanese side must be subject to Soviet law, then the Soviet Union will not enforce the judgment of a 500,000 ruble fine. (Associated Press, 30th)

(Moscow) According to reliable sources, the Soviet authorities in North Sakhalin Island have notified those on the Japanese side who enjoy oil and coal concession rights that if a satisfactory solution is obtained, the fine of 500,000 rubles recently ruled by the court may not be paid under seizure procedures. At the same time, a Soviet newspaper published an article stating that we believe the Japanese side's claim that the Soviet Union intends to end the Japanese concession rights. The Soviet authorities recently earnestly stated that the Japanese people can still operate their concession rights, but they must strictly abide by the contract obligations and Soviet law. (Reuters, 29th)

(Moscow) Sakhalin Island Japanese commercial oil and coal mining companies have been fined 374,000 rubles by the Soviet court for violating their contracts with the Soviet trade union, and the companies were ordered to pay the full amount by the 19th of this month, otherwise their assets would be seized. The Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tōgō Shigenori, protested to the Soviet government, and at the same time, the Japanese commercial companies conducted negotiations with the Soviet side. This was the situation a few days ago. According to news from Aleksandrovsk-Sakhalinsky, Sakhalin Island, the Soviet authorities have notified the Japanese commercial companies that they do not intend to implement the seizure, so the supervisors say that although the negotiations between the two sides may be delayed, a compromise solution can ultimately be reached.

### Chinese Guerrillas Active in Northern Jiangxi; Japanese Suffers Severe Blows; De Rui Road Base Completely Destroyed; Ruiwu Road Outposts Also Recaptured

Zhangshu: After the Japanese occupied Nanchang, their forces were insufficient, and the rear of northern Jiangxi was very empty. As a result, Chinese guerrillas launched long-term mobile attacks. The Japanese army's strategy of defending strongholds and lines in northern Jiangxi has recently suffered severe blows from the Chinese military. For example, the De Rui and Ruiwu Roads are the transportation hubs of the Japanese in northern Jiangxi. After the Chinese guerrillas continuously attacked the outposts along the De Rui Road, the Japanese army felt extremely threatened and was forced to abandon them automatically last month. After the Chinese completely destroyed the De Rui Road base, they recently continued to attack the Ruiwu Road. After more than thirty battles, the Japanese suffered heavy losses. The Chinese then recaptured Yejiaxiang, Dawenhe, Da'ao, Xiao'ao, Fengjiapu, and Henggang Village on the Ruiwu Road and sent troops to garrison them. At the same time, they also completely destroyed the 50 li-long highway, turning the road base into a pond. Currently, the Japanese's road transportation on the Ruiwu Road can only reach Fanjiapu from Ruichang, which is only more than 30 li long. In order to force the Japanese to completely abandon the road, fierce battles are being waged near Fanjiapu. (Telegraph, 29th)

### One Week of War Situation: 23rd to 29th

(Chongqing) Spokesperson of the Military Committee said, since this week, the Japanese army has been moving troops frequently on all fronts, especially the so-called "mopping-up" battle in southeastern Shanxi, which is more intense. However, after our continuous attacks, they have suffered heavy losses and are now gradually entering a state of silence. Regarding the course of the battle, the important ones are described below:

Shanxi: On the southeastern Shanxi front, after our army successively recaptured Yangcheng and Qinshui on the 25th and 26th, the Japanese offensive has recently stalled and the battle situation has turned to silence. Since the beginning of this month, the Japanese army has moved out in six routes, one route from Xiyang and Heshun to the south, one route from Bo'ai to the north, one route from Wu'an to the west, and three routes from Taigu, Anze, Yicheng, etc., to invade westward, attempting to "clear" our army in the area in one fell swoop. However, they suffered from our soldiers' continuous attacks, the continuous rain on the battlefield, and our people's firm policy of clearing the fields, so the Japanese army that invaded southward along the Baijin Highway, although repeatedly attacked our strongholds such as Xiangyuan, Tunliu, and Lucheng, were decisively able to recapture Yushe and Wuxiang after our army reinforced and pursued them. The Japanese army that invaded eastward from Yicheng, captured our Yangcheng, Jincheng, and Huguan, and we intercepted them midway, successively recapturing Zhongcun, Dongfeng, Yangcheng, Qinshui, and other strongholds, and killed nearly a thousand Japanese in the two battles of Lanche and Zhen. In the victory of Dongfeng, the Yamazaki Regiment infantry artillery unit, known for its elite, was almost completely wiped out by the Japanese. Now Qincheng has been surrounded by us, and the Japanese are actively reinforcing and preparing to counterattack. As for the triangular area of southern Shanxi, our two armies have also had fierce battles for days, and Dongcun Station east of Yuxiang and Qinghua Town have been recovered, and the Datong-Pukou Railway traffic has been cut off. The key points southeast of Xiaxian City are also all in our hands, and the siege is in progress.

Henan and Hubei: On the southern Henan front, our army launched a fierce attack on Xinyang and Changtaiguan in separate routes last week, breaking into the north and south gates of Xinyang again, occupying the station, and recapturing the outposts northwest of Changtaiguan. Since the 23rd, the Japanese have been constantly reinforcing and counterattacking. More than 3,000 Japanese troops invading northward from Changtaiguan, combined with tanks and aircraft assistance, captured our Minggang on the 24th. Our army fought fiercely and once recaptured it. More than 2,000 Japanese troops invading westward from Xinyang, part of which bypassed Minggang to the north, were met with our separate attacks, and fierce battles took place in Sanguanmiao, Yangmiao, Yaomen, Guxianzhen, and other places. In this battle, the number of Japanese casualties, including Minggang and Yaomen, has exceeded 1,000. The battle is still going on fiercely. As for the various routes in western Hubei, our army has launched attacks on the Japanese army for days, recovering many places. On the northern Hubei front, Leigutang, an outpost near Suixian County, was captured on the 25th, and the county seat has been surrounded. On the central Hubei front, Yangzi, Zhujiamiao, and Yangji northeast of Zhongxiang were stormed on the 23rd, and Lejiatan was recaptured. On the same day, Baoshuan, Yingjialing, and Duoxianghe near Qianjiang were recaptured, and they are now advancing towards the county seat. On the southern Hubei front, Mushigang was captured once on the 23rd, Chongyang was stormed on the 25th, and Tingsiqiao and Daxian were captured on the 26th, cutting off the northern section of the Yuehan Railway.

Guangdong: The Japanese army occupying Chao'an, after our fierce counterattack, broke into the city again on the 17th and 22nd, fighting fiercely for several days and nights. A part of the main force of the Japanese Maori Regiment was wiped out by us. We have continued to mop up the area for days, and there is no Japanese trace in Yunli Kongqiuchi Anbu in the west, Guanchao Gulou Jinshi Shaxi in the northwest, and Dahao in the east. At the same time, the Japanese army that occupied Chenghai on the 17th also retreated to the Waishe area south of the city to wait for reinforcements due to the threat. Also, the Japanese army that landed in Shanwei has all retreated after our army bravely welcomed them. The battle situation has now become calm. As for the northwest Liangjiang area, the Japanese army in Sanshui, Xinhui, and Shengang have been attacking Yangmei, Liantang, Yinxidong, and other places for days, and have fought with our army in Xinyu, Fenshui, and Shitanling. The Japanese have not succeeded and have retreated to their original positions. On the 25th, our army once stormed the Japanese positions in Xinyu and seized many spoils. At the Hengmen estuary in Zhongshan, Japanese warships took the opportunity to provide artillery cover on the morning of the 24th, and infantry landed. Our army gave them a head-on blow, and the Japanese did not succeed. In addition, Jizhong regained Jiuzhou and other places along the Beining line and approached Langfang, stormed Wangguanzhuang south of Qinghe, besieged the counties of Lingxian, Linqing, and Chiping, burned the munitions warehouse in Gaomi, recovered Ma'anshan in northern Hunan, once captured Yanglousi, surrounded Linxiang, recaptured Huafang and other outposts in northern Jiangxi, forced the outskirts of Ruichang and Jing'an counties, and defeated the Japanese army that invaded Lizhuang from Nanchang. In northern Anhui, Huaiyuan was recaptured, and a large Japanese ship near Dongliu was destroyed. In western Zhejiang, Xingu Town in Tongxiang was stormed, and the Japanese captain Yamada was killed.

### Anti-British Movement Takes Another Step

(Beijing) Sixteen British missionaries from the Taiyuan Baptist Hospital, who were expelled by the local anti-British movement and came to Beijing, are currently being blocked in Shijiazhuang due to the severe floods that have completely disrupted traffic on the Pinghan Railway. Almost all British missionaries in Shanxi Province have been expelled, but the fate of the few who live in southern Shanxi, whose news has been cut off for a long time, is still unknown. The anti-British movement in Beijing has now taken another step. The police have gone to various Chinese shops, instructing them to remove all British goods and transport them elsewhere, because British goods are not allowed to be sold here. It is now known that Chinese business groups held a secret meeting this week and passed a resolution opposing the exclusion of British goods, saying that the current business is already depressed and should not be disturbed again. It is said that this resolution has been notified to the leaders of the anti-British movement. (Reuters, 30th)

(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: On the 29th, all employees of the Jian An Water Company, a Sino-British joint venture, received threatening letters, coercing them to resign immediately and not to serve the British anymore. Also, the Yihua Foreign Firm, an Italian company, received warning letters for transporting vegetables to the concession, limiting them to not supply any food to the concession from now on.

### Garrison Troops in Hong Kong to be Rotated

(Hong Kong) The British Army's 2nd Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers, will soon be transferred to Hong Kong to relieve the current garrison. The Scottish troops of the Middlesex Regiment stationed in Hong Kong will be transferred to the Mediterranean, including Malta, and British troops from Essex, England, will also be transferred to Hong Kong to strengthen the garrison. The defense of Shanghai may be taken over by the Tyneside Scottish, with troops transferred from elsewhere to Tianjin. Furthermore, the Hong Kong government has approved the construction of an air defense headquarters in Happy Valley, with construction commencing in August and expected to be completed by the end of the year. The Compulsory Service Ordinance and the Naval Volunteer Ordinance will come into effect on August 1st. (30th Dispatch)

### American Church School Bombed in Wuzhou

(Chongqing) Eighteen Japanese bombers bombed densely populated areas within Wuzhou city, Guangxi, on the 26th. The Red Cross Hospital was hit by two bombs, and the Bible school run by the American Baptist Church was destroyed by eight incendiary bombs. Sixty civilians were killed and thirty wounded. (30th Associated Press Dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to official reports, eighteen Japanese aircraft yesterday indiscriminately dropped bombs on densely populated residential areas of Wuzhou. Even the Red Cross Hospital was hit by two bombs, and the Bible school run by the American Baptist Church was struck by eight incendiary bombs. The Japanese aircraft dropped over a hundred bombs in total, resulting in sixty civilian deaths and three hundred and thirty injuries. It is a tragedy. (30th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)

### Bank of Communications and Bank of China in Chongqing Provide Loans to Refugees

(Chongqing) According to news from here today, four hundred refugees here have already obtained 20,000 yuan in loans from the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China, enabling them to re-establish small shops, small workshops, and small businesses such as miscellaneous goods stalls. The two banks have prepared a total of 600,000 yuan in loans for refugees, but due to a lack of guarantors, the loans have not been issued. It is reported that the method of providing loans to refugees by the two banks is for the refugees to provide mutual guarantees, in other words, a refugee who wants to obtain a loan must have three other refugees act as guarantors. The amount of the loan ranges from five to eight hundred yuan, depending on the refugee's ability to repay the debt and the profitability of their business. Most of the loans are given to refugees currently living outside the city, and small workshops outside the city are allowed to obtain the most loans because they are less likely to be attacked by airplanes.

### Excerpts from French Press Commentaries on the Far Eastern Situation

(Paris) The revocation of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty by the American government continues to receive positive reviews from local morning newspapers. A right-wing newspaper stated, "The revocation is a serious warning to Japan, and this is also the view in Tokyo. The United States, in recent events, has deliberately not expressed solidarity with other countries. This decision came suddenly, and the Japanese side is even more surprised. According to the commercial situation between the United States and Japan, the United States sells twice as many goods to Japan as it purchases from Japan, which is extremely beneficial to the United States. Now, by revoking the existing commercial treaty, President Roosevelt, in addition to achieving a political victory, probably also wants to make a good deal. The so-called political victory is because the issue of amending the Neutrality Act suffered a setback, so he took this opportunity, with public opinion as his backing, to wipe out the previous humiliation. The so-called good deal is to force Japan to return to a sensible attitude. Although Germany has signed a commercial agreement with Japan at this time, the raw materials needed by Japan cannot be supplied by Germany at all, so it will have no choice but to conclude a new commercial treaty with the United States, and give the necessary guarantees to the interests that the United States maintains in the Far East, as a condition for exchange." The right-wing "Echo de Paris" published a dispatch from its London correspondent, stating, "The two demands put forward by Japan, (1) the silver deposited by Chinese banks in British and French banks in Tianjin should be handed over to the Japanese side, (2) the paper money issued by banks controlled by the Japanese side in the occupied areas should be recognized, the above two items are actually related to the interests of Britain and France, which is very different from limiting the scope of the original negotiations to the Tianjin incident. In Britain and France, they do not intend to recognize the currency system forcibly implemented by Japan." "Le Temps" reported, "After the initial Anglo-Japanese agreement was reached, only our newspaper expressed disapproval. At that time, we explained two things: (1) Britain could have organized an anti-aggression front in the Far East, and this is confirmed by the current attitude of the United States, which is increasingly credible; (2) Britain's concessions to Japan cannot satisfy its desires, but will only invite new demands and new threats. Regarding this point, the news from the Far East is sufficient to prove it. The British newspapers have also changed their tone. The Tokyo initial agreement may not be respected by Japan, which is almost identical to Germany's disrespect for the Munich Agreement." "Le Republicain" stated, "The anti-British movement in North China is intensifying, and it can be seen that the Japanese side is determined to pursue an anti-British policy. Judging by its attitude, it is hypocritical. As such, it is difficult to conclude a final agreement with Britain. Fortunately, London still has a weapon that has not been used, namely economic sanctions. However, if Japan can purchase goods from the American market one day, then even if Britain implements economic sanctions, it may be detrimental and unprofitable. If the United States can come forward to cooperate, the effect will be significant." "L'Humanité" stated, "For the governments of Britain and France, if they want to pursue a wise and reasonable policy, they should take the warning constituted by the US revocation of the treaty as a starting point, and revive the prestige of the democratic countries in the Far East. Both Britain and France have commercial treaties with Japan, and they can be used as economic weapons to issue warnings to it, or even as a tool for retaliation. This issue is serious in nature and should be discussed jointly by the countries concerned to determine their attitude." (30th Havas Dispatch)

### German-Japanese Commercial Agreement Will Not Affect Sino-German Trade - German Diplomacy is Exhausted - Difficult Progress on the Danzig Issue

(Berlin) After the conclusion of the German-Japanese commercial agreement, economic circles here have commented that the trade relations between Germany and China will not be affected as a result. This agreement does not apply to the occupied areas of China. As for German credit loans to Japan, they will be handled by a German banking syndicate, which is entirely of a normal commercial nature. (29th Havas Dispatch)

(Berlin) According to foreign observers here, German diplomatic policy is gradually becoming exhausted. Since the US government announced the revocation of the US-Japan commercial treaty, the German side has been extremely disappointed. It is difficult to conclude a commercial treaty with Japan to respond, which is not of much significance. Yesterday, Führer Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop suddenly returned to Berlin, and it was thought that Germany might take some political action, but there was no indication as a result. Generally speaking, the leaders of the Nazi Party originally had this intention, but after careful study, they have already abandoned it. As for the fact that Führer Hitler and other important figures have left the capital for other places, although the German official said that the country is powerful, the government is relaxed and has no worries, in fact, the new developments in the international political situation have made the German authorities feel deeply troubled and have to make excuses to comfort themselves. For example, although Spain has been persuaded by Germany and Italy in many ways, its attitude remains cold. Japan has so far refused to join the German-Italian military alliance treaty. In addition, the anti-German sentiment in the protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia is also increasing day by day. As for the issue of the Free City of Danzig, the leaders of the Nazi Party also believe that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's insistence that the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor should be unconditionally merged into Germany is too hasty. In short, as a result of the evolution of the current situation, Germany must either resort to war or surrender. If it surrenders, it will be defeated, and the Nazi regime will inevitably suffer a fatal blow. As for declaring surrender, the position of the Nazi government will also be greatly shaken. The future situation is not optimistic. (29th Havas Dispatch)

Saarbrücken Führer Hitler, accompanied by the Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, arrived here yesterday to inspect the Saar defenses. He expressed satisfaction with the new defense works and praised the effectiveness of the special forces protecting the defense line. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop accompanied Hitler. Hitler then returned to Beirut by plane. (30th Haitong News Agency)

(New York) The New York Times has continued to comment on the US government's abrogation of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Japan, saying, "As far as German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini are concerned, this move by the US government can make them understand two facts: first, all provocative actions that harm US interests will be dealt with by the US with strong resolve; second, if such provocative actions continue, the political unity of the United States will be strengthened as a result. It is a pity that the authorities of Germany and Italy have apparently failed to understand these facts due to a misunderstanding of the issue of amending the US Neutrality Act. We can see from the comments made by the newspapers controlled by these countries that German Propaganda Minister Goebbels and Italian government spokesman Gayda have not understood this."

Approaching from All Sides

### British Navy, Army and Air Force Prepare for Major Exercises - Home Fleet Concentrates on Scottish Coast - 12,000 Naval Reservists Enlist

(London) The British Home Fleet's summer leave ended yesterday and has sailed from the south to the Scottish coast. 55,000 local troops have also entered camp. 12,000 naval reservists have been conscripted due to the impending "crisis months" of August and September and will report tomorrow. On the evenings of August 8th and 9th, half of England will conduct the largest air defense exercise since the German Air Force attacked London in May 1918. At that time, all lights will be extinguished, and more than 1,000 aircraft will participate in the air defense exercise. King George will inspect the reserve fleet on August 9th. The fleet will conduct its first joint exercise with the Home Fleet since July 1914. The reserve fleet includes 130 warships. After the 12,000 reservists report, the fleet can set sail within a few hours. (30th Associated Press Dispatch)

Portsmouth Several warships belonging to the British Home Fleet, including the aircraft carrier "Ark Royal", cruisers "Aurora", "Glasgow", and "Somali", have recently departed from this port for Loch Ewe in northern Scotland to prepare for exercises. However, the flagship, the battleship "Nelson", will remain here for several days before departing. At the same time, a portion of the naval reserve soldiers recently called up, totaling 3,000 men, have arrived here and will be assigned to the various ships of the reserve fleet after undergoing physical examinations in order to participate in the exercises.

### Spanish Minister of the Interior Denies Internal Strife

Burgos Spanish Minister of the Interior Suñer met exclusively with a Reuters correspondent today and stated that there are no rifts in Spanish politics and no internal strife. However, at this time, the new nation is groping forward, and unexpected events may be unavoidable. The case of General Lano (the dismissed commander-in-chief of the Second Military Region) has been resolved simply and smoothly. General Yagüe (commander of the Madrid garrison) has never been arrested and is on very good terms with me. According to recent rumors of internal strife among Spanish government officials, it is said that General Lano was dismissed for making indiscreet remarks during a speech in Seville. Parisian newspapers also reported that General Yagüe was arrested for opposing cooperation with the Axis powers, and that other generals are also out of favor. (29th Reuters Dispatch)

Hendaye News from the border last night stated that Spanish leader General Franco is now conducting a purge of the garrisons on both sides. Since the secret police in Bilbao put down a small riot, reactionary elements in the army have been exiled. When reactionary elements disturbed public order by painting slogans on the walls of the security command, they were suppressed. The slogans lamented the lack of bread and called on all Spaniards to prepare for a counter-revolution. (30th Associated Press Dispatch)

### Italian Air Force Exercise Completed

(Rome) The Italian Air Force recently conducted a large-scale exercise in the central Mediterranean airspace. According to an official statement, a total of 480 aircraft participated in the exercise, flying in formation from various bases in Italian Sardinia, North Africa, Libya, the Aegean Sea, and the Province of Friuli in mainland Italy. They were fully loaded with military supplies, and some had a range of up to 1,500 kilometers. Some bombers also conducted night bombing exercises hundreds of kilometers away from their bases. It is said that all aircraft flew a total of 300,000 kilometers in the Mediterranean airspace and never had an accident. (29th Havas Dispatch)

(Rome) The Italian Air Force conducted a large-scale exercise in the central Mediterranean for four days from July 25th to 28th. A total of 408 aircraft from the air force bases of Sardinia, Sicily, Puglia, and Libya participated in the exercise. Yesterday, it was announced in the official gazette that "the exercise was a test of the special tactics of the air force in the high seas, and the result was satisfactory, proving that Italy has built an excellent air force." (30th Haitong News Agency)

### Lloyd George Says Situation is Serious, Never More So Than Today

(London) Former Prime Minister Lloyd George, leader of the Liberal Party, recently gave a speech in Wales, broadly discussing the international situation. He said, "The international situation is more serious now than at any time since 1914. If you ask me, an old man of seventy-six, why I have not retired to the countryside but still travel around the country giving speeches at political gatherings, my answer is very simple: the international situation is more serious than at any time since 1914. I feel that my duty is not to abandon myself to idleness. I still remember that four years ago, when the League of Nations had not yet collapsed, its 58 members were all behind Britain. But now, only France and Poland have close ties with us. Therefore, it is necessary to try to unite with the Soviet Union. When the Nationalist government first came to power, the national defense budget was £117,000,000, and this year it will reach a huge £800,000,000." This increase in the budget is enough to prove the seriousness of the international situation, and the guarantee that our country has given to Poland is a willingness to provide assistance to that country if it is invaded. But it is impossible to send warships to provide assistance. Therefore, "without obtaining the cooperation of the Soviet Union, how can assistance be implemented? It must be known that the Soviet Union is the strongest land power in the world. We are now negotiating with this friendly country, asking it to come to our aid when necessary. This is not comparable to plotting peace with the enemy. However, Prime Minister Chamberlain would rather go to Germany himself in September last year to meet with Führer Hitler, and visit Rome in January this year to inquire about Mussolini's health and praise him as a good man, but now, in conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union, not only does the Prime Minister not deign to go in person, but even a cabinet member is not sent, but only a secretary of the Foreign Office is sent to Moscow. Is this reasonable? It should be known that at this time Führer Hitler is deploying defenses in the Free City of Danzig, and before the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is established, the city of Danzig will belong to Germany. In short, the policies pursued by the current government are all wrong. Even in terms of domestic land production, if war breaks out, domestic land production will inevitably be inferior to that of 1914. The reason for this is that those who call themselves the Nationalist government do not have a deep understanding of the livelihood of the people. The planting of food is also an important part of national defense, no less important than the manufacturing of aircraft and other armaments. In the previous European War, Germany succumbed to food panic, which can serve as a lesson for the future." (29th Havas Dispatch)

### Brief News from Various Countries

(London) The diplomatic correspondent of "Sunday Dispatch" recently declared that Britain is preparing to be actively involved in diplomacy, urging the countries of the Balkan Peninsula to improve their relations. In addition, after Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, recently came to London for an unofficial visit, the British government will grant credit loans to the country and increase its purchases of various products, mainly timber. At the same time, it also plans to grant credit loans to Bulgaria. (29th Havas Dispatch)

Warsaw News has recently been received here that the Senate of the Free City of Danzig will issue an order within days to implement compulsory military service to replace the current method, that is, all citizens between the ages of eighteen and twenty are obliged to be conscripted into the police. However, young people in the city who have not served as police officers have already joined various organizations of the Nazi Party, which is actually equivalent to compulsory military service. Therefore, if the Senate issues an order, it will only be recognizing the actual situation. In addition, military supplies from Germany are still being transported to the city of Danzig in a steady stream. Today, another 5,000 tons of gasoline, 2,000 tons of lubricating oil, and a large number of heavy trucks (mostly owned by the former Czech army) were transported to the city. (29th Havas Dispatch)

(Paris) The Council of State decided today to extend the term of office of the members of the current Chamber of Deputies from four years to six years. In this way, the re-election in 1940 will be postponed to 1942. This matter arose from the intention of Prime Minister Daladier, because the government has recently received reports from all sides, learning that the international situation is extremely serious and that it is necessary to be cautious and prepared in order to maintain peace. If necessary, it will fulfill its various obligations without the slightest retreat. Under these circumstances, it is essential that all parties in the country eliminate prejudices, unite, and strengthen national defense. Therefore, it was decided to extend the term of office of the members of the Chamber of Deputies so that the political passion caused by the election campaign can be avoided. (29th Havas)

### Japanese Aircraft Repeatedly Bomb, Guilin Begins Evacuation Work - Various Agencies Meet to Formulate Measures

Guilin Correspondence, since the establishment of the Southwest Military Headquarters, Guilin has suddenly become the center of military and political affairs, its importance in terms of its position no less than Chongqing. Therefore, Japanese aircraft frequently patronize. In the past two months, after the Japanese army suffered repeated defeats in Zhongtiao Mountain in southern Shanxi and Dahong Mountain in northern Hubei, the Japanese army, in order to cover up its military setbacks, took advantage of its air superiority to destroy the materials of important cities in the rear of the Chinese army. Chongqing and Guilin were subjected to inhumane bombing. At the beginning of this month, the Southwest Military Headquarters convened a meeting of military, political, and party authorities in Guangxi Province to discuss air defense measures. They all said that in order to preserve strength, it is necessary to have a precise set of passive air defense plans. Therefore, the Guilin Pacification Commissioner's Office and the Guangxi Provincial Government were ordered to be responsible for the preparation. Subsequently, Cao Qingbiao, Deputy Director of the Military Headquarters, Sun Renlin, Director of the Provincial Government, Chen Gui, Director of the Mobilization Committee, Tang Ji, Deputy Director of the Air Defense Headquarters, Xie Zongkeng, Director of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, Wu Yu, Section Chief, and others jointly met to draft a plan for evacuating the population and materials in Guilin, and urged the relevant agencies, bureaus, groups, and organizations to step up their work.

Evacuation work is planned as follows: (1) It was decided to first evacuate the agencies, schools, and groups in the Guilin urban area. (2) and (3) are confidential. (4) Evacuation areas were designated and locations were assigned for separate transfers. (5) Personnel were assigned to survey the evacuation areas and proceed separately. Cao Qingbiao was dispatched by the Southwest Military Headquarters, Xie Zongkeng was dispatched by the Pacification Commissioner's Office, Sun Renlin was dispatched by the Provincial Government, and Tang Ji was dispatched by the Air Defense Headquarters. (6) The evacuation of all materials from the various agencies and schools shall be based on the evacuation area designated by the original agency. (7) The evacuation of materials from the various mass organizations shall be based on the original designated evacuation area. (8)

The following matters should be noted in each evacuation area: (A) sanitary facilities, (B) transportation facilities, (C) air raid warning, air raid shelter or air raid room facilities, (D) identification and post office box facilities, (E) housing or shed construction facilities, (F) evacuation area market facilities. The above facilities shall be planned and properly handled by the original competent agency. (9) The prices of mud, water, carpentry, and carpentry work required for the construction of each evacuation area shall be determined by the Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Department in consultation with the various trade unions in order to avoid manipulation and hoarding. (10) When surveying the evacuation area, engineering and sanitation personnel should be brought along for design purposes

Various buildings (11) First, the Provincial Police Department is responsible for investigating the exact number of people in the city and the number of agencies, schools, and groups to determine the need for the width of the evacuation area. At the same time, the Air Defense Headquarters is responsible for adjusting the air raid shelters for citizens. (12) After the survey of the evacuation area is completed and locations are assigned, separate evacuation measures will be determined. It is found that the above items were discussed and carried out separately on the 15th. It is heard that at the latest by the end of this month, all agencies, schools, and groups in the city will be able to begin the evacuation work. According to the opinions of various military and political officials, the first step is to evacuate the elderly, the weak, women, and children in the urban area, then the agencies, schools, bureaus, and offices, and then the materials and merchants in the urban area. After all plans are completed, the entire implementation will be carried out.

### Japanese Troops Invade Shantou, Also Send Planes to Bomb Lufeng Hetian

Shantou Dispatch: The supreme commander of the Japanese Navy in South China, Kondo Akira, led a fleet to invade Shantou on the 18th. It is reported that his sole purpose is (1) to intensify the blockade of the Chinese coast, cutting off China's overseas supply lines; (2) to establish a military base in Shantou, echoing the Japanese troops in Chaoshan and Dongguan Shilong, and forming an outer encirclement of Hong Kong, cutting off Sino-British commercial and economic relations. On the morning of that day, six Japanese warships and twelve aircraft, covered by more than twenty speedboats, bombarded and bombed Magong, launching an invasion. The Chinese military and civilians calmly fought back, sinking two Japanese boats and killing or wounding dozens of Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops retreated to their ships. However, thirty shops and houses in Shantou city were destroyed by bombing. On the same day, two Japanese planes flew from Shenquan sea area, under the jurisdiction of Huilai County, into Lufeng Hetian and dropped three bombs. Two bombs landed on the main street, and one bomb landed on Fish Street, collapsing eight houses and killing or wounding more than ten civilians. The planes then flew over Daan, Dawu, Fenhe, Hepo, and Jieyang areas for reconnaissance. On the 20th, more than ten seaplanes flew to the eighteen villages near Shantou for reconnaissance, bombing and strafing the people with machine guns in Magong, Xiayang, Dongchong, Zhuyuan, and Lun. In Honghai Bay, seven or eight Japanese warships were anchored, covering four or five hundred marines, who took more than seventy speedboats and rubber boats and rushed into Xingang. The Chinese military and civilians rose up to resist, repelling the landing Japanese troops twice. At 10:00 AM, the Chinese army's cover was bombed and destroyed, and Shantou city was struck by forty or fifty bombs, turning it into scorched earth. The army then retreated with pain to Miwei, a small hill about twenty-five *li* from Shantou, which is a necessary passage to Haifeng City. The highway bridges along the way had been destroyed by the Chinese army in advance, so the Japanese armored vehicles and engineering corps could not operate. In the evening, the Japanese troops reached the vicinity of Miwei with their morale already weakened. The Japanese troops invading Shantou landed in several places. On the same day, four or five Japanese electric boats were sunk by the Chinese army, killing or wounding more than two hundred people. Finally, one thousand soldiers who landed were attacked by the Chinese army stationed in Chaijin, Huiyang, on the 21st, under orders to prevent the Japanese army from advancing further.

In the Chaoshan area, the Chinese army once again rushed into Chaoan City on the evening of the 19th, besieging Jinshan and Hulu Mountains. The Japanese troops in the city were quite empty because they had been transferred to Chenghai City and Shantou. The battle on Zhugao Mountain and Hulu Mountain was extremely fierce. The Japanese army even used poison gas bombs. The Chinese military and civilians were unable to prevent it, and more than one hundred people died from poisoning. The Chinese army on Anjie Road occupied Fuyang, Gezhou, Yunbu, and Jinshi, defeating the Japanese army and seizing many tanks, cannons, ammunition, and weapons. At present, there are only four Japanese warships in Shantou. In the sea area outside Mayukou and near Chaoyang and Tatou Mountain, the Japanese army has laid mines to prevent foreign ships from entering Shantou.

### Fujian Authorities Actively Seek Ways to Evacuate Overseas Chinese Families, Relieve Refugee Overseas Chinese, Send Personnel to Comfort and Investigate Living Conditions

The Fujian provincial authorities, considering that the families of overseas Chinese mostly live in coastal areas and rely solely on remittances from Nanyang to maintain their livelihoods, realize that their difficulties are more serious than those of the general public at a time when the Japanese are blockading the ports. Therefore, evacuating overseas Chinese families and relieving refugee overseas Chinese is a matter of great urgency. Thus, last month, the Fourth Section of the Provincial Government sent a letter to various overseas Chinese associations, requesting them to immediately provide their opinions on the above issues for reference. Recently, the Fuqing Overseas Chinese Association replied in a letter: "After investigation, the number of overseas Chinese in our county is very large, and most of their families are in China. In this time of tension and serious situation, our association pays great attention to the safety of overseas Chinese families. We have sent personnel to various coastal towns to advise overseas Chinese to evacuate women and children as much as possible to ensure their safety. We have also sent our chairman, Zai Xiangzi, to various hometown associations in Nanyang to promote the government's policies and seek funds to actively support overseas Chinese families. As for relief, we have convened rice merchants and wealthy overseas Chinese to organize a food adjustment committee, raising funds to purchase large quantities of rice and storing it in safe areas, implementing price controls to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding. Furthermore, our association believes that the responsibility of relieving wartime refugee overseas Chinese is heavy and that a sound organization is essential to cope with it. We have held a meeting and decided to establish a refugee overseas Chinese relief committee." It is reported that the Provincial Government has deeply appreciated the above opinions, and it is also reported that the overseas Chinese associations of various counties are also paying close attention to the evacuation of overseas Chinese families and the relief of refugee overseas Chinese and have successively started preparations in accordance with the organization of their counties. The purpose of the association is to provide relief to overseas Chinese families who are victims of the war and cannot be evacuated.

The source of relief funds is from donations from overseas Chinese from various Nanyang territories. In addition to the Standing Committee, the organization is divided into seven sections: Accounting, Documentation, Evaluation, Fundraising, Investigation, Relief, and Audit. It is also reported that the association holds two meetings every month to handle routine matters and holds meetings at any time when necessary. With this relief organization in the county, overseas Chinese families who are victims of the war and cannot be evacuated can all find a place to live, allowing overseas Chinese struggling overseas to avoid worries about their families. It is also reported that the Provincial Government, for the sake of comforting overseas Chinese families and providing relief, will send those who are familiar with the situation of overseas Chinese in southern Fujian

to guide everything. Provincial Councilor Lin Qingshan was sent to Dehua and Yongchun areas to comfort overseas Chinese families, investigate their living conditions, and discuss relief measures for refugee overseas Chinese. From this, we can see the government's attention to evacuating overseas Chinese families and relieving refugee overseas Chinese.

### Commemorating a Sincere Friend of China: Dr. Han Ninghao

— Qu Liang

Religion and education complement each other and are interlinked. Without education, reason cannot be fully developed, and the difference between humans and animals is negligible. Without religion, the treasures of the spirit lack the possibility of inspiration, life is controlled by instinct, and one cannot step into the threshold of transcendence. Bishop Han Ninghao has devoted himself to religious and educational undertakings for nearly half a century. What has passed has been transformed, what remains is divine. His influence is profound. His power to gently guide and inspire people is so great that one can imagine his own profound attainments. Dr. Han's spiritual life is indeed deeply hidden, and we have no way of knowing it. However, his rich life, presented before our eyes, is always the bits and pieces of his inner life and its expression. We might as well do a brief study.

Han Ninghao was born in 1862 in Men, Westphalia, Germany, and died in 1939 as the Bishop of Yanzhou, Shandong. Although he lived only seventy-seven years, he spent as many as fifty-three years in China, including thirty-two years as a bishop. He was proficient in Chinese language and spoke the Shandong dialect fluently. If you only heard his voice and did not see him, you would definitely think that he was a Shandong "fellow villager" speaking to you, and you would not hear a trace of a foreigner's accent. He spoke Mandarin with great style and was a natural speaker. Moreover, he wrote Chinese very well. His book "Questions and Answers Explained" has been popular in China and has recently been printed in its twelfth edition. He understood the situation in China, understood Chinese culture, appreciated the psychology of the Chinese people, and deeply felt the lovableness of China and the Chinese people. Years ago, he returned to Europe on official business. In a hurry, he returned to China. When people asked him why, he said, "I want to die among the Chinese people." He was afraid of dying in Europe and not being able to return to his homeland.

Dr. Han Ninghao was not only a religious figure but also a scholar. He had a very deep foundation in early literary education. Therefore, he was able to delve into the roots of Greek and Latin literature. After joining the Society of the Divine Word, he carefully studied theology and was ordained as a priest in 1885. Later, he studied philosophy and natural science at two universities, Engzig and Penler, before coming to China to preach. From this, it can be seen that his academic attainments were very deep and that he was able to grasp and have a very deep understanding of modern knowledge and trends of thought. Therefore, his speeches and writings were very correct and appropriate, and they were well received by the German people. Therefore, the Mingxing German Academy of Sinology invited him as a special honorary member to reward his contributions to religion and culture.

Over the years, Shandong has been plagued by natural disasters and man-made disasters. Under the pressure of floods, fires, and wars, people have been unable to live. Bishop Han has repeatedly exhausted all his possessions and done his best to save the poor and displaced, truly practicing loving others as himself. The Sino-Japanese War has lasted for more than two years, and countless people have spent their tragic and helpless lives in the flames of war and on the road of exile. I commemorate Dr. Han Ninghao here because he was a religious figure, an educator, and especially a complete person. At the same time, I also want to awaken the sympathy of righteous Germans for China. (End)

On the evening of the 22nd of this month, Cao and his friend went to the Ri Xin Pond to bathe. While dozing on a chair, three strong men suddenly attacked Cao with box guns. Cao was shot three times, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the strong men left with a roar.

### Japanese Troops Erect Obstacles on the Eastern Section of North Jiangxi Road; Rumors Say This Move Is to Delimit Defense Zones; Residents Are Moving Out, Situation Is Very Tense

North Jiangxi Road, starting from the northern end of the Waterworks Bridge in the south and ending at the old shooting range road to the east end of a row of shops and houses, as well as alleys, has been suddenly blocked by the Japanese side since more than 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. According to the reporter's new observations from yesterday's patrol, the Japanese side is using wooden poles and barbed wire to block the eastern end of the road, causing many shops to be surrounded and unable to operate. However, at several intersections such as the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Tiantong Road, the intersection of Qipu Road, the intersection of Jiaojianshi Road, and the intersection of Haining Road, there are gaps in the barbed wire blockade at the eastern end, allowing shops and residents in the area to enter and exit, and to move freely without the need for passes. However, it is obvious that these gaps will be blocked again in a few days. At that time, residents living in the area who want to enter the central area of the concession will need the same procedures as those living in Hongkou, resulting in many moving vehicles parked on North Jiangxi Road. Those moving from the blocked area to the concession are constantly increasing. It is said that some shops near the Iron Horse Road Small Vegetable Market, located at the eastern end of North Jiangxi Road, have been doing well in business on weekdays. Once blocked, the losses in their business are difficult to describe. At each gap on the road, there are Japanese soldiers on guard, and the situation is quite tense.

The Incident of Conflict Between British and Japanese Soldiers

The *North China Daily News* reported that yesterday (the 29th) in the afternoon, four British soldiers from the West Yorkshire Regiment, traveling in a truck, went to a lane next to North Jiangxi Road to remove the barbed wire obstacles erected by the Japanese army during the 1937 war in the Japanese defense zone. When they were replacing it with new barbed wire, they were surrounded and detained by the Japanese marines and were unable to return to North Jiangxi Road. The time was 3:45 PM, and the situation was very tense. At 7:00 PM, the four British soldiers and the truck were released and returned to their own defense zone.

After the British soldiers were detained, 250 Japanese marines, carrying wooden stakes and barbed wire, arrived at the scene. Some Japanese sentries stationed themselves in the middle of North Jiangxi Road, which is in the British military zone, to protect other Japanese soldiers removing the British-placed wire mesh on the east side of North Jiangxi Road and replacing it with Japanese barbed wire obstacles. They also forced the few West Yorkshire British soldiers to withdraw from their defense houses on the east side of North Jiangxi Road near the firing range and sealed off the houses. These British soldiers stood on the west side of Peng Road and watched. However, when the Japanese sentries had completely withdrawn last night, American soldiers cut off the obstacles erected by the Japanese soldiers and re-entered their defense houses. When the Japanese soldiers erected obstacles as high as six feet in the British defense zone on the east side of the road, thousands of Chinese residents living east of North Jiangxi Road were quite alarmed and carried boxes and baskets into the British defense zone. At the same time, Japanese sentries with guns and bayonets stationed themselves on the center of North Jiangxi Road, five yards inside the British defense zone. Although they did not prevent the Chinese from leaving the Hongkou district east of the road, at least one Japanese sentry slapped an elderly Chinese woman who was passing by on the cheek. Yesterday's incident seems to confirm that the British soldiers were in the wrong because the British defense zone extends to the east side of North Jiangxi Road, and the sidewalk on the east side is the western end of the Japanese defense zone. However, in the past, little attention has been paid to this point. The barbed wire obstacles built by the British army the year before last can still be seen on Peng Road and Wuchang Road, ten yards west of North Jiangxi Road. The four British soldiers thought that the Japanese army would not object to their entering the Japanese defense zone to replace the new obstacles in the middle, so they went to work in the lane. British and Japanese military officers and police officers began consultations on Wuchang Road in the Japanese defense zone around 6:00 PM. It was then heard that although the Japanese soldiers had not yet removed the obstacles they had erected, they had retreated to their defense zone. However, all parties believed that the matter had been resolved, and the Japanese soldiers would remove the obstacles in the late night or this morning (30th) and return to their defense zone. In recent weeks,

rumors have been rampant that the Japanese soldiers intend to completely erect obstacles on North Jiangxi Road and have built defense houses in various locations, requiring Chinese residents in the area to register. However, the British soldiers have still been able to live in the defense houses in the Japanese defense zone on the east side of the road, indicating that the Japanese authorities do not object to the British soldiers stationing there until yesterday. The British soldiers had only erected barbed wire between Bazi Road and Haining Road so that the Chinese could freely enter the Xihongkou area. However, yesterday, the Japanese soldiers erected obstacles throughout North Jiangxi Road all the way to the Suzhou River, leaving only small gaps at each intersection to allow pedestrians to pass through. While the officers were conducting consultations, several truckloads of armed Japanese marines were stationed behind them waiting for orders. However, after the Japanese soldiers erected the obstacles in the evening, there were no other actions. Early this morning, Chinese residents continued to withdraw in droves. However, after yesterday evening, the Japanese sentries had withdrawn, and by 10:00 PM, there were no Japanese marines to be seen in the vicinity. At the same time, the West Yorkshire British soldiers divided

into two groups, cut off the Japanese soldiers' obstacles, and re-entered the defense houses near Bazi Road and the bottom floor of the telephone company building at the corner of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road. Late last night, there were few people to be seen on the streets east of North Jiangxi Road, while the west side was as bustling as a hive. The Japanese soldiers' obstacles extended to Tiantong Road. There were rumors that the Japanese soldiers' obstacles near the post office headquarters had already been

removed by the Japanese soldiers and that the Japanese soldiers would electrify the barbed wire. However, there was no sign to confirm these rumors late yesterday night. According to a Japanese naval spokesperson last night, the Japanese soldiers erected obstacles in order to delimit the defense zone boundaries and are preparing to investigate all residents in the Marine Corps defense zone starting from August 1.

### Shanghai Subsidiary Coin Panic, Expected to Be Thoroughly Resolved; 500,000 Subsidiary Coin Notes Printed in Hong Kong; Lead Coins Also Being Minted by Bank of China

After the Ministry of Finance approved the request of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and ordered the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank to issue 1-cent and 5-cent subsidiary coin notes to circulate in Shanghai to regulate the situation, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency obtained reliable information from the Central Bank yesterday regarding the issuance of 1-cent and 5-cent subsidiary coin notes. The bank has signed a printing contract with the Hong Kong Yongning Printing Company, totaling 300,000 yuan for 1-cent notes and 200,000 yuan for 5-cent notes, for a total of 500,000 yuan. According to the contract, delivery will be made within 20 days from the date of signing the contract, and they will be issued by the Central Bank. The bank, considering that the 1-cent notes are inconvenient to count and easily damaged, plans to issue "aluminum" coins, also in 1-cent and 5-cent denominations. It has also actively consulted with the Ministry of Finance to proceed. The cost of the aluminum coins is quite expensive, similar to the tokens of the former Shanghai China General Omnibus Company. The decision to first issue 500,000 yuan in subsidiary coin notes is a temporary relief measure during the transition period, and aluminum coins will be issued in the future. Regarding the 500,000 yuan in subsidiary coin notes, they are expected to be shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai by mid-August and officially issued.

### Uniform Public Bond Principal and Interest Payments to Begin Today; Bank of China Receives Official Notice from Headquarters; Shanghai to Handle Discount Payments in Six Installments

After the Ministry of Finance suspended the payment of principal and interest on various bonds guaranteed by customs duties due to the interception of customs duties, the National Debt Fund Management Committee, in order to maintain credit and stabilize the market, consulted with the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank to agree to discount and pay the uniform principal and interest due at the end of the month. The Shanghai branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Communications Bank have now received notice from their headquarters that they are authorized to handle discount payments starting today. The details are as follows:

Shanghai Installment Discount Method

After the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank discounted and paid the uniform public bond seventh installment principal and interest due at the end of July, the four banks and the National Debt Fund Management Committee agreed on a discount method, stipulating that Shanghai will pay it off in six installments, each lasting one month. The "discount certificates" and installment payment forms have all been printed, stipulating the amount to be received per installment based on the certificate. If there is a fraction of less than one cent in Shanghai, it should be included in the sixth installment for combined calculation. The discount certificate is based on the account name, with one form filled out per household, and the five types of bonds (A, B, C, D, and E) do not need to be listed separately.

Official Notice from Headquarters Arrives in Shanghai

Yesterday was Sunday, and the Central Bank was closed as usual. The reporter from the New Voice News Agency paid a special visit to a deputy director at his private residence. According to him, the principal and interest of the uniform public bond due at the end of this month will be discounted and paid by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank. However, Shanghai will handle it in six installments, paying with remittances. The paying agencies are the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Communications Bank. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has now received notice from its headquarters that it is authorized to start payments on the 31st, and all procedures are ready. The discount is the result of the National Debt Fund Management Committee consulting with the four banks and reaching an agreement.

Eighth Principal Repayment Lottery Date

The National Debt Fund Management Committee has determined the lottery date for the eighth principal repayment of the uniform public bond: (1) Type A, August 10, 25 winning numbers will be drawn, repaying 3.75 million yuan; (2) Type B, September 10, 10 winning numbers will be drawn, repaying 1.5 million yuan; (3) Type C, October 9, 8 winning numbers will be drawn, repaying 2.8 million yuan; (4) Type D, November 10, 8 winning numbers will be drawn, repaying 4.4 million yuan; (5) Type E, December 9, 8 winning numbers will be drawn, repaying 2.08 million yuan. The payment date is January 31 of next year.

Maintaining Credit Always Remains Unchanged

The Ministry of Finance's policy of maintaining credit remains unchanged. After the war, the central bank overdrawn the accounts for payments, totaling over 17 million yuan, which is enough to prove the government's determination to maintain credit. As for the notice on January 15 to stop financing overdrafts, it is a common sense of world affairs, explaining that "when the customs duties of the war zones that have already been deposited and owed are submitted to the General Customs Department in accordance with the old regulations, the funds for debt compensation will still be allocated," so this measure has been deeply understood by both Chinese and foreigners. The Ministry of Finance does not oppose the decision of the four banks to handle uniform public bond discounting.

### Compatriots from Gaogiao, Baoshan Repair Sea Dikes; Typhoon Direction Changed Yesterday Afternoon; Gale Warning Signal Hoisted Outside Wusong Port

The sea dikes of Baoshan and Gaogiao outside Wusong Port have been out of repair since the war. Although the compatriots' associations managed to repair them last autumn, the project was so large that it was not easy to raise funds. Therefore, only the collapsed embankments were filled in, which was inevitably crude and simple. Although it was hoped to consolidate them, the dikes were attacked during the first typhoon this year, causing more collapses. Fortunately, it is not yet the peak tide season in autumn, so there was no danger. In order to prevent floods, the Shanghai Pudong and Baoshan Compatriots' Associations are carrying out repairs to the collapsing embankments to avoid danger in the coming autumn.

Second Typhoon Direction Changes

The two new typhoons that originated in the Pacific Ocean on the 26th have been declared: The first typhoon has been extinguished. According to the report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 2:00 PM yesterday, the typhoon is still at 131 degrees east longitude and 24 degrees north latitude. According to yesterday morning's report, its direction was north-northeast, staying southeast of the Ryukyu Islands without change. By the 2:00 PM report, the direction had changed from north-northeast to northwest and was advancing, but the speed was very slow. The wind range was 120 nautical miles, 600 nautical miles from Shanghai. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the typhoon's future path.

Wind Signal Flags Added in Wusong

In order to facilitate ships outside Wusong Port, the Jianghai Customs Port Authority Director Tebek has temporarily issued Gale Warning Signal flags to indicate wind conditions in Wusong in the Sixth Bulletin, stating: "The regulations of the Ranlu Signal Station on indicating typhoons and wind conditions were announced in the eighth bulletin of this department on August 24, 1932. Now, in order to facilitate ships anchoring outside Wusong Port, it is specifically stipulated that the same wind signal flags will be hoisted on the Wusong large wind signal mast or on the flagpole on the top of the Wusong Quarantine Sub-station near the Wusong Lighthouse. If there are any changes in the future, they will be announced by this station. Only one or two black balls will be hoisted temporarily at the above signal locations during the daytime. All merchants and sailors are hereby notified. This bulletin is specially issued."

### 京滬車遭襲擊　橫林附近地雷轟炸鐵軌四濺　機車貨車出軌交通昨已停頓

Mainland newspapers report that guerrillas fighting along the Shanghai-Nanjing railway line launched another attack near Wuxi around 7:00 AM yesterday (the 29th), using machine guns to strafe a mixed passenger and freight train and blowing up several sections of the track. The locomotive and eight freight cars were derailed. While the number of casualties is unknown, it is reported that several passengers were killed and some injured. Several Japanese railway guards also died. A Japanese military spokesperson acknowledged the attack yesterday in response to inquiries, stating that this was the third successful attack on the Shanghai-Nanjing line by guerrillas since February of last year. The mixed passenger and freight train was attacked by about 400 guerrillas yesterday morning at 7:00 AM between Changzhou and Wuxi. The bombing occurred 300 meters from a bridge. Although the bridge was unharmed, several sections of the track were destroyed, and the locomotive and several freight cars were derailed.

The train was carrying farmers and goods. It was ambushed by guerrillas shortly after leaving Changzhou. The spokesperson said in response to another question that there were no Japanese soldiers on the train other than the train guards. Details of casualties are unknown. However, it is reported from other sources that the train was strafed with machine guns, resulting in deaths and injuries. This was one result of the attack. The

Shanghai-Nanjing express train that departed from the North Station yesterday morning returned last night. Because the Shanghai station did not receive the news, the Shanghai-Nanjing express train departed as scheduled at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Upon reaching the scene of the incident, Japanese soldiers ordered the driver to drive the train back to Shanghai. According to a passenger on that express train, heavy machine gun and rifle fire could still be heard when the train arrived at the scene. They did not know the exact nature of the incident, nor were they

allowed to leave the train, only hearing that the track had been destroyed. However, due to the gunfire nearby, they believed that the guerrillas were involved. Furthermore, the news agency reported that a train derailment occurred between Changzhou and Wuxi on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway on the morning of the 29th. The incident occurred at 7:00 AM when a train of 3rd and 4th class carriages, Train No. 10, traveling from Nanjing to Shanghai,

reached a section 350 meters west of Bridge No. 6185 between Henglin Station and Luoshe Station in Wujin. A landmine pre-positioned there by guerrillas was triggered with a deafening explosion, sending sleepers flying and rails scattering. The locomotive and the eight freight cars in front immediately derailed and overturned. At that time, the guerrillas who had been lying in ambush there,

numbering about three hundred, immediately surrounded the train and opened fire. After receiving the news, Japanese troops stationed in Changzhou rushed to the rescue, but the guerrillas had already retreated. At the same time, the Shanghai Railway Bureau also immediately dispatched an ambulance and vehicles loaded with sleepers. However, due to the extensive damage, it was not easy to repair immediately, resulting in the suspension of traffic on the Shanghai-Nanjing line yesterday. It is reported that many passengers were injured in this incident.

### 法幣準備充足　中外一致擁護　現金準備較各國為高　發行新滬幣難成事實

With the Ministry of Finance's determination to maintain the value of the legal tender (fapi), the issuance of fapi is particularly cautious, and reserves remain adequate. As of the end of June this year, the total amount of fapi issued by the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) was 2,626,929,300 yuan. Cash reserves (including gold, silver, and foreign exchange) accounted for more than 44% of the total issuance. Although slightly lower than before, it is higher than in most countries in the world.

Since the implementation of the fapi policy, domestic and foreign individuals have found it convenient. The banknotes previously issued by foreign banks have been gradually withdrawn and are now nowhere to be found on the market. The statutory foreign exchange policy of the Central Bank of China remains unchanged. To date, the British exchange rate remains at one shilling and two and a half pence, and the US exchange rate remains at 30 US dollars. It is now heard that some people are suggesting that the authorities in the concession issue a new Shanghai currency. Although it has not been confirmed whether this news is true, it is important to know that

Chinese fapi is the only currency of China recognized by all countries. Shanghai is a part of China. Legal currency should be used within China, and new currencies should not be issued separately, thereby undermining

the currency system and hindering the circulation of fapi. Domestic and foreign individuals who seek to develop trade should all maintain the fapi so that the foundation of the fapi becomes increasingly consolidated.

### 徐家匯　聖母院育嬰工作

— Chen Zhengfan

The Xujiahui Orphanage of the Holy Mother was established in 1869 as a magnificent structure of Catholicism in Shanghai. It has made many outstanding achievements in infant care, which is worthy of our attention and praise. Because of my investigation of childcare, I visited and studied the orphanage's infant care situation. I have written down an outline of it as follows:

The Xujiahui Orphanage of the Holy Mother was established in the eighth year of the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the late Qing Dynasty (1869 AD), and has a history of seventy years to date (Note 1). Its founder was Father Xue Kongzhao of the Catholic Church. Thanks to the resolute talent of the first director, Mother Duominwu, and her thirty years of long-term efforts (Note 2), the orphanage is booming and has the grand scale of today. The hospital is now divided into an infant care center, kindergarten, school for the deaf and dumb, Qiming Girls' School, Christmas Girls' School, Xuhui Girls' Middle School, medical clinic, laundry, embroidery shop, lace room, sewing workshop and other departments. The current director is Dai Bu Xian President (President of the Rescue Association), and those in charge of infant care affairs are Mother Augustine.

All affairs of the Holy Mother's Hospital are now handled separately by the Sisters of the Rescue Society (more than 150) and the Virgins of the Dedication Society (more than 20), completely on the basis of sacrifice and service, without receiving any compensation. As for those serving in the infant care center, there are 12 Mothers, 14 teachers, and more than 30 nannies and workers.

The Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care accepts helpless infants from birth to five years old. Since its establishment, it has accepted more than 25,000 infants. There are currently 650 infants. It is said that after the August 13th Incident, an average of 3,000 infants are admitted each year. In the past, 22 infants would be admitted on one day, and 80 infants would be admitted in one week, which was common and not an exception.

The Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care has considerable and complete medical equipment. At the same time, all the Mothers have rich medical knowledge (Note 3), and the famous doctor He Lizhong is often responsible for his voluntary work, so he can accommodate as many sick infants as possible and give them appropriate and timely treatment. According to the person in charge of the hospital, other infant care centers in Shanghai (such as Renji Infant Care Center) also send sick infants to the hospital for treatment and accommodation. In order to provide infants with fresh and clean milk, the Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care has specially raised 24 dairy cows. Dairy milk is milked daily by specialized technicians and disinfected. This is not only a pioneering initiative in the childcare industry in Shanghai, but also rare in China.

Male infants in the Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care are fostered in Catholic families after they are one year old, and the hospital provides a subsidy of four to nine yuan per month. On the first day of each month, the foster families must bring the infants to the hospital, where they are examined by the person in charge. If any improper treatment is found, they will be explicitly pointed out and strictly ordered to make improvements.

The Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care follows the policy of assuming full responsibility for the entire life (material and spiritual) of each infant admitted, attempting to cultivate and educate the infant into adulthood, teach him/her skills, and assist in choosing a spouse to establish a devout and happy family. Based on this unique policy, the hospital has no intention of adopting or imitating the common adoption system used by ordinary infant care centers.

Infants in the Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care receive kindergarten education from the age of six, learning to read, listen, play, sing, etc. every day. Their daily life is as follows: (1) Get up at 6:00 a.m. and say morning prayers, (2) Breakfast at 7:00 a.m., (3) Take a walk at 7:30 a.m., (4) Learn to read and listen at 8:30 a.m., (5) Eat snacks at 9:30 a.m., (6) Sing and play at 10:00 a.m., (7) Lunch at 11:00 a.m., (8) Nap at 12:00 p.m., (9) Eat snacks at 3:00 p.m., (10) Take a walk and play at 3:30 p.m., (11) Dinner at 5:30 p.m., (12) Evening prayers and sleep.

Infants at the Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care who are growing up are sent to the Tushanwan Orphanage to continue their studies when they are six years old. Girls who are six years old are taught elementary school courses and are instructed to learn sewing (a required subject), embroidery, lace, weaving, and other household work.

When girls at the Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care grow up to be adults, the hospital will help them choose a spouse and establish a family. According to the hospital's rules, those who enter the hospital are dedicated to Catholicism and can only marry Catholic men. The heads of the hospital believe that only orphans can deeply love orphans, so they strive to help adult orphans from the hospital marry adult orphans from the Tushanwan Orphanage to seek permanent and reliable happiness. If the orphans are willing to work after marriage, the hospital will be responsible for arranging work for them (embroidery, lace, weaving, etc.); otherwise, the orphans and the hospital will maintain close contact and emotional harmony forever, just like biological mothers and daughters.

Because the Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care has its own houses, raises dairy cows, and the staff are sacrificial, the average monthly cost for each infant is only eight yuan. This is very different from other infant care institutions. (According to Renji Infant Care Center, the average monthly cost per orphan is 21 yuan, and the average monthly cost per child in the Shanghai War Zone Infant Shelter is 19.2 yuan).

The Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care relies on donations from Chinese and foreign believers and the surplus from various production projects organized by the hospital. The hospital's leaders never solicit donations from the public because there is no need to do so.

(Note 1) Father Xue Kongzhao founded the Holy Mother's Hospital in Hengtang, Qingpu in the fifth year of Xianfeng of the late Qing Dynasty (1855), moved to Wangjiatang in the third year of Tongzhi (1864), and moved to Xujiahui in the eighth year of Tongzhi (1869). If the history of the Xujiahui Holy Mother's Hospital is calculated along with its predecessor, it has a history of 84 years.

(Note 2) Mother Duominwu was a French national who preached in China for a total of 56 years and devoted 30 years to the planning and management of the Holy Mother's Hospital.

(Note 3) The Mothers of the Catholic Church have medical and nursing knowledge. They not only preach but also heal people's suffering. After the foreign exchange was tightened, the price of coal balls increased again and again due to rising raw material costs and high costs. The price per ton was 52 yuan to 56 yuan. The retail price of the same goods also varied by three to four corners. The highest price was 3.23 yuan per tan, and the lowest price was 2.67 yuan per tan. The quantities were also inconsistent. The situation was chaotic and can be said to have reached its extreme. It is reported that the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association has issued a notice on the retail price of coal balls from August 1 in order to unify the market price, stipulating that the retail price of each 100 city catties of national currency is 3 yuan, and no arbitrary increases or decreases are allowed. At present, the source of domestic coal has disappeared. All of it depends on the supply of foreign coal in Shanghai. It is said that Indian coal is the most popular. Although the price of coal is high, the source is still smooth. Indian coal has been shipped in large quantities in recent days. The city's inventory is sufficient, and there is no shortage of fuel. The selling price is expected to gradually stabilize, but since foreign exchange has been repeatedly reduced, the price of foreign coal has risen accordingly. After each ton has increased by more than 10 yuan, the Japanese side has taken the opportunity to ship coal from Shandong and other places to Shanghai for mixed sales. The selling price is more than 10 yuan lower than that of foreign coal, and sales are very smooth. It is rumored that the Japanese side will ship large quantities of coal from North China and other places to Shanghai for dumping in order to seize the market.

### 米糧堆棧徹查　嚴懲囤戶操縱　米業今開聯席會議　蕪米開禁早稻出新

There will be a thorough investigation of rice warehouses, and severe punishment for hoarders and manipulators. The rice industry will hold a joint meeting today, the ban on Wuhu rice will be lifted, and early rice will be released.

The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, in view of the rising rice prices in Shanghai, which is related to the livelihood of ordinary people, in order to find ways to adjust the sources and stabilize market prices, because this matter is of great importance, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve results if carried out alone, so it has specially invited the Shanghai Rice Business Association, the Rice Milling Industry Association, the Rice Grain Sales Association, the Changshu Rice Industry Office, the Nanbang Office, and the Rice Transportation Merchants United Association. And other seven groups held a joint meeting. The original letter is recorded as follows: Dear Sir/Madam, Our Association is scheduled to hold a joint meeting at 4:00 pm on the 31st of this month (Monday) on the second floor of the Grain Exchange on Avenue Edward VII to invite representatives of various rice industry groups in the city to discuss important matters. It is hoped that your (association) (office) will send representatives to attend the meeting at that time.

### 執行限價　徹查囤積

Enforce price limits and thoroughly investigate hoarding

In addition to strictly enforcing food rice price limits and making every effort to dredge up the source of domestic rice, the concession authorities will thoroughly investigate the number of rice stored in each rice warehouse and the names of the owners, and have already begun a thorough investigation. There are 77 warehouses, 9 belonging to the French Concession and 68 belonging to the International Settlement. All the warehouses that have been investigated shall be certified by the investigators. If it is found that someone is hoarding privately for huge profits, they will be severely punished and ordered to be sold below the price limit. In addition, citizens are allowed to report incidents that exceed the price limit in order to investigate and deal with them.

### 通知應查　米糧堆棧

Notice of rice warehouses to be investigated is as follows: Bank of China, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Bank of Communications, Shanghai First, Shanghai Second, Jiangsu Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, New China Bank, China One Trust, Zikang, Local Bank, China Real Bank, Donglai Bank, Wan Shen Xing, Hengfeng, Longmao, Yucheng, Shengji, Yongsheng, Taikang, Hefeng Yuan, Zhengfeng, Dafeng Chang, Deda, Dayouyu, Deherun, Gongji, Runji, Dade Xin, Xin Yu, Shenghe Long, Xian Mao, Hengda, Lianyi, Dade Xin Nan, Jutai He, Jiangnan, Heng Xing Yi, Yi Xing Feng Nan, Yi Xing Feng Dong, Jiuda, Wan Chang, Xinye, Pinghe, Wan Sen Sheng, Zhang Xieji, Qiada, Datong, Wan Sheng Tai, Xie Chang De, Yuan Mao, Tong Shen, Mao Tai, An Shen Er, An Shen San, Taikoo, Roosevelt, Chang Yi Heng, Ding Tai De, Xie Da, Guang He, Hu Feng, Xin Yuan, Ding Yu, Yuantong, Ding Yu, Huang Changsheng, Ding He, Heji, Heng Xin Shun, Tong Sheng Heng, Heng Xing Gong, Deng Rentai, Yuelai, Daxing, Wan Tai Xiang,

### 東新登塲　蕪湖弛禁

Dongxin rice has entered the market, and the ban on Wuhu rice has been lifted.

According to the Xinsheng News Agency reporter's interview with Fu Qian Geng, Director of the Market Management Committee, the Pudong new japonica rice has entered the market, with an annual output of 30,000 to 50,000 shih. Sample rice has arrived in Shanghai and is of excellent quality. It will be shipped to Shanghai in batches. As for the Yangjian rice in Jiaxing, it will be on the market soon, but sample rice has not yet arrived in Shanghai. Regarding the ban on rice from Wuhu, it is heard that those who hold old removal permits can still ship it out of the country. It is said that new removal permits will be issued on August 1, and a "export tax" of 20 cents per tan will be added. Secondly, the ban on rice and grains from Wuxi, Changshu, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Pinghu and other places is also more relaxed than before, and they can be transported and sold to Shanghai through transit.

### 華董主張　嚴懲操縱

Chinese directors advocate severe punishment for manipulation

Regarding the price limit on rice and grains, the authorities previously invited representatives of rice merchants to agree on a maximum rice price of 21 yuan per shih, and stipulated that the price should be gradually reduced every week according to market conditions by one yuan per turn. Therefore, after the rice price in the city was lowered to the maximum price limit of 20 yuan two weeks ago, it was originally planned to find a way to change it to 19 yuan. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange tightening incident occurred, and a group of speculative hoarders took the opportunity to manipulate the price, causing the rice price to rise again and almost reach 23 yuan in the dark market. Fortunately, it was stabilized thanks to the proper control of the authorities. It is now learned that all Chinese directors of the Public Works Department, namely Yu Qiaqia, Yuan Ludeng, in view of the soaring rice prices, which has a great impact on people's food, the reason for this surge is obviously the manipulation of shuttle hoarders, in order to suppress market prices and stabilize people's livelihood, they advocate that speculative hoarders and rice merchants who raise prices should be severely punished, so as to punish one hundred, and the future of the rice market can be expected to be stable.

### 德籍猶太人來華　具體計劃　負責人柏格拉期稱　移民機關經濟協助

German Jews come to China with concrete plans. Person in charge, Berglas, said that immigration agencies will provide economic assistance.

According to the Mainland Daily, Berglas, who was in charge of discussing the matter of German Jews immigrating to China two months ago, issued a statement yesterday (29th) stating that the central government and the Yunnan Provincial Government are prepared to allow 100,000 German Jewish immigrants to enter China under certain circumstances, with the right to reside and work, enjoy government protection, and have the rights and obligations of Chinese citizens. Jewish refugees must bring sufficient funds to cover the cost of food and accommodation for one year, estimated at 50 pounds sterling per person, which will be allocated as follows: 14 pounds for one year's food, 12 pounds for building houses, and the remaining 14 pounds for start-up capital. The organizing committee of the world's leading immigration agencies has also established a cooperative bank to handle accommodation and business issues in the first one or two years according to the planned economic model, and to provide immigrants with special training in physical and intellectual education. After one or two years, they should be self-sufficient. However, this plan is purely economic and has no political nature, which will benefit China and all parties involved.

### 百老匯大廈內賭場　停業敬告　日海軍發言人　咋巳發表聲明

The casino in the Broadway Mansion is closed for business. The Japanese Navy spokesperson issued a statement yesterday.

According to the Mainland Daily, the Japanese Navy spokesperson told reporters last night (29th) that the casino named "Temple", which opened on the 18th floor of the Broadway Mansion last week, was warned to close on Friday night.

After this news was published, the Mainland Daily editorial department received an anonymous phone call. The person spoke with an American accent and contained threats. He asked who belonged to this manuscript. He wanted to know the name of the reporter of this manuscript in order to provide information about the casino.

### 夫妻仳離後　婦忽請求廢約　前日傳審諭令退候核辦

After the couple divorced, the woman suddenly requested the revocation of the contract. The trial on the previous day ordered the case to be returned for review.

Xiao Junhou, a graduate of Fudan University, had an unusually harmonious relationship with his wife, Zhang Qin, after they were married, because they both had considerable knowledge. They had been married for several years and had one child each. It can be said that it was a happy marriage. However, on January 15 of this year, they both went to lawyer Zhang Danping to ask him to certify the divorce agreement that they had already negotiated on their own. Zhang, who did not know either party, asked them if they had no objections to the divorce terms after seeing the unexpected parties, and then went through the procedures for certification and publication. However, only ten days later, Zhang Qin suddenly visited Zhang alone, saying that the previous incident was suddenly forced by her husband, and she could not agree to it. Since then, the existence or abolition of the divorce contract has become the focus of the dispute between the two parties. It has been several months and has not been resolved. Recently, Zhang Qin filed a lawsuit against Xiao Junhou in the First Special District District Court, requesting the cancellation of the contract. The head of the civil court, Li Hu, held a hearing on the previous day. Neither of the original defendants appeared in court. Only lawyer Zhang, who was the certified person of the contract, appeared in court in accordance with the summons. After describing the circumstances of the certification for both parties on that day, the court ordered the case to be returned for review.

### 某方卡車肇禍　撞斃老嫗

A foreign truck caused an accident and killed an old woman.

Liu Xu, an old woman from Hubei, was fifty-two years old this year and lived at No. 36 Zhoujia Lane, Pudong. She made a living as a vegetable vendor. Yesterday morning, she sold a load of cowpeas. She crossed the Huangpu River to Shanghai. She landed at around seven o'clock, carrying her load on her shoulder, and then went to the small vegetable market on Fourth Ma Road to sell them. In front of No. 107 Avenue Edward VII, she was crossing the road from south to north, walking to the center of the south half of the road. A truck No. 20366, driven by a foreigner, was speeding from east to west. Old woman Liu could not avoid it and was knocked down, injuring her head. The truck continued to drive straight ahead. It was seen by Russian constables at No. 119, who rushed forward to chase the truck and was finally caught and brought to the police station to report the situation. On the one hand, the police sent Liu to Renji Hospital, but she died of her injuries. The police were notified to send the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch mortuary to be examined. The Second Special District Court will be requested to send personnel to inspect the body today. The driver of the accident truck was reportedly escorted by the police to the consular office in Shanghai under the jurisdiction of the case for investigation.

### 生活艱難　路有棄孩

Life is difficult and children are abandoned on the road.

In these extraordinary times, with serious national crises, combined with foreign exchange shortages and soaring gold prices, everything is expensive, causing ordinary people to feel the pressure of life and the pain of hardship. Recently, some lower-class people have given birth to children and felt unable to raise them, so they abandon their children everywhere. The police have found them and sent them to charitable organizations for adoption. This has been seen many times in the newspapers. The other day, a blue cloth package was found on the side of Rue Grosse in the French Concession, containing a female infant who had been born for more than ten days. She was crying loudly. The police saw her and took her to the police station. The Second Special District Court was asked to arrange for her. The judge ruled that she should be sent to a charitable organization for foster care. Also, recently, there have been girls aged three or four to five or six who have gotten lost. The police have seen them, taken them to the police station, and transferred them to the Second Special District Court for instructions. They have all been ruled to be sent to charitable organizations for foster care pending collection. When the reporter asked the girls, they said that they were out playing with their families and got separated and lost. However, there are very few family members who report to the police station asking for an investigation. It is speculated that the reason for this is also that they are too poor to make a living, so they are abandoned on the road. The situation is very pitiful.

### National Physician Qi Linsheng Accused of Indecent Assault Case, Judge Reassigned for New Trial, Witness Testifies All Fabricated False Accusations

A Suzhou woman, Chen Wangshi, residing at No. 1 Wufeng Lane, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lubin, previously appointed lawyer Hu Yongsheng as her representative, filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Qi Linsheng, a Henan national physician who runs a business in Yongyu Lane, Route Lafayette, of enticing her 19-year-old daughter, Chen Sanyuan, on October 7th of last year,

Leaving Home

Hiding and sexually assaulting her at No. 522 Rue Péreire until April 12th of this year, when she was finally found on the street and brought back. She requested Qi to be punished for crimes such as disrupting family ethics. The case was previously concluded by Judge Liao Yuan, but because the judge was reassigned to the Civil Court, the conclusion of the debate was revoked. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Until yesterday, Judge Sun Pengxian opened the Criminal Court

For a New Trial

Both parties and their lawyers were present. Chen Wangshi and Chen Sanyuan successively testified about the above-mentioned events. When questioned, the defendant Qi Linsheng denied the indecent assault. Then, witness Zhang Shucheng testified that the defendant was his friend and that the plaintiff was initially introduced to the defendant by him to prescribe medicine to quit opium. This was entirely a fabricated fact with the intention of extortion. He also said that her mother ran a brothel and her

Daughter a Prostitute

The co-tenant He Gongdu also knew about it. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer immediately stated that the witness's insults to the plaintiff were excessive and requested the clerk to record it for a separate lawsuit. After verifying the statements, the court ordered that the co-tenant He Gongdu be summoned to court for questioning and rescheduled the trial for August 2nd. The defendant was released on the original bail.

### Refugee Lottery Committee Scheduled to Host Press

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Charity Lottery Committee is organized by enthusiastic people from friendly nations with the aim of relieving refugees. It has the same nature as other charitable organizations. The Lottery Committee, in view of the fact that the previous lottery sales system involved multiple intermediaries, resulting in huge expenses and inability to sell smoothly, has now directly commissioned Fengxing Company to handle it. It is learned that Mr. Ou Nong, the general manager of the company, has been in charge of charitable causes such as floods, droughts, and military disasters in various provinces for more than ten years and has considerable experience. Since the start of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, he has assisted Father Jacquinot in handling relief work in the Nanshi refugee area and has made remarkable achievements and is admired by all walks of life. This decision to take over the lottery business is bound to be optimistic for the future of promotion. Also, the Western name of the association is Lotovie de Bienfaisance pour Les Refugies S.A. The official Chinese translation is the Refugee Relief Lottery Committee. The current lottery tickets have already been printed and cannot be changed. The official translation will be used for all future issues. The association, fearing misunderstandings from all sectors of society, plans to periodically invite the press and lottery merchants in the city, hosted by Father Jacquinot and others, within the month to report on the distribution of relief funds and the process of distributing them to various shelters, so that all sectors can understand the truth and facilitate sales for the benefit of refugees. It is heard that Mr. Blancart, the transport chief of the International Red Cross, has come to Shanghai from the United States to help Chinese refugees. He has contacted overseas Chinese in the Philippines and Indonesia along the way to promote refugee lotteries. The overseas Chinese there are enthusiastically subscribing because it concerns the relief of fellow refugees. It is expected that the sales of this issue will exceed previous records.

### Ministry of Education Improves School System Adds Six-Year Secondary Schools Without Distinguishing Between Senior and Junior High Schools Establishes Five-Year Vocational Schools Within the Higher Education Stage

(Chongqing News) In order to promote educational administration in various provinces and cities and reform the school system, the Ministry of Education of the National Government has formulated and promulgated various points for revising the school system, based on the resolution of the Third National Education Conference, referring to the current school regulations and actual needs, and ordered the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to conscientiously follow them as appropriate. (1) Within the secondary education stage, in addition to the original 3-3 system secondary schools, six-year secondary schools will be established, without distinguishing between junior and senior high schools. (2) In addition to attaching simple normal science courses, the original 3-3 system junior high schools may also attach simple vocational science courses to recruit junior high school graduates. (3) Within the higher education stage, in addition to the original two-year and three-year vocational schools, five-year vocational schools will be established to recruit junior high school graduates and students with equivalent academic ability to junior high school graduates.

### Chen Dongyuan, Section Chief of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, Talks About How to Choose Departments and Schools Government Limits Liberal Arts to Reorganize Them Any Subject Can Lead to Success as Long as It Is Studied Well

(Chongqing News) Chen Dongyuan, Section Chief of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, published an article on how young people should choose departments and schools when applying to schools. The content is very concise. The details are as follows:

Principles Discussion

Young people who want to go to school must choose schools and departments when applying to schools, and their choices generally have certain principles. Unfortunately, the principles commonly used may not be very reasonable and are worth discussing. For example, (1) the principle of national needs. This is a very common principle. Every young person applying to school has the idea of ​​serving the country. In today's lack of talent, this is also very appropriate. However, it is very difficult to say what kind of talent the country needs and what kind of talent the country does not need. There are eight different colleges in universities: liberal arts, science, law, agriculture, engineering, commerce, medicine, and teacher training. None of them are not needed by the country. Hu Shih is known to everyone. When he went to the United States to study, he was determined to study agriculture because agriculture is a practical subject and China is still an agricultural country. Studying agriculture well can practically save the country. Who knew that after studying for two years, he felt that it was not close to his nature, so he changed from agriculture, a very practical subject, to philosophy, the most theoretical subject in liberal arts. When he changed departments, he wrote a poem containing the line "Saving the country in everything, what can't be done." Sure enough, after returning to China, he used his philosophical cultivation to launch the cultural movement of the May Fourth period, which greatly awakened China's ideological circles. This is enough to prove that literature can also save the country, and its influence is even greater than that of practical subjects. The needs of the country are very complex with thousands of threads. Any academic skill is needed. In the past ten years, the government has had a policy of restricting liberal arts and law, so some people think that liberal arts and law are not worth studying. However, after carefully studying the government's intention to restrict liberal arts and law, it does not mean that it will no longer train talents in liberal arts and law. It is only because the establishment of liberal arts and law does not necessarily require how to equip them. A group of universities filled with incompetent people simply opened courses casually, and because no experiments are required, the number of students admitted at all levels is one or two times more than in science and engineering, so it is inevitable to produce rough and shoddy products and reduce the degree. Therefore, the government came out to restrict them. In other words, it is actually reorganizing them, hoping that the liberal arts and law schools left behind by various schools will be enriched and can create real talents to meet the needs of the country. Since the Anti-Japanese War, everyone has thought that the need for engineering will definitely increase in the construction of the country, so last year, in the unified enrollment, 33.9% of the students applied to the engineering college. The number of students who applied to the aeronautical engineering department was the largest, which is enough to prove the young people's enthusiasm for serving the country, but this view is not very correct. If all young people want to study engineering, thinking that it is the way to save the country, then all cultural undertakings, social work, and political work other than engineering will have to stop. Agriculture and commerce cannot be improved either. How can the country be built then? Therefore, I think that the principle of choosing departments based on the needs of the country is very good, but it can only be used as a higher ideal. In fact, at least in the next 20 years, the country needs all kinds of talents. (2) The principle of personal career prospects. This is a more common principle. Every student applying to school is considering which subject will have broader career prospects after graduation. The number of people applying to the aeronautical engineering department was the largest last year, which is also the reason. Studying is originally to put knowledge into use, so this is also very appropriate. However, this reason is not absolutely correct. In countries where various industries are on track, the relationship between studying and career prospects is indeed closer. For example, the United States is like this. Railways and highways have already been built in all directions. It is simply not easy for students graduating from civil engineering to find jobs. Other subjects that you want to study are also worth paying attention to the social needs. Which talents are insufficient and which are surplus, but in China, a new country that is starting to build, everything is waiting to be done, and the needs are huge. There are no accurate statistics on existing talents, and there are no detailed plans for future careers. It is simply impossible to determine the differences in the needs of various subjects. If you ask which subject has good career prospects, I think it is better to ask you whether you can study any subject well. Any subject, as long as you study it really well, has career prospects. Engineering, agriculture, commerce, and medicine are indeed professions. Literature and philosophy can also be used as professions. Law, politics, and education are even more so. They are all professions, and they are all needed by the current society. The only thing to fear is not studying well. As the old Chinese saying goes, "Every profession produces an expert." This sentence still has merit to this day.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Expenditure on Chinese Education Over the Past Eight Years Totals Over 1.487 Million Yuan

The Shanghai Municipal Council has always attached great importance to Chinese education. It is true that Chinese education has been promoted and developed rapidly in the past ten years. The number of high schools and junior high schools established in the concession area has increased year by year. Therefore, in addition to the original Chinese primary schools established by the bureau, the bureau also provides a large amount of funding each year to subsidize the education expenses of private Chinese schools. The amount of funding increases according to the situation of the school's request. The reporter recently investigated at the Education Department of the Municipal Council. From 1932 to 1939, in the past eight years, the Municipal Council has subsidized Chinese school expenses totaling 1,487,425 yuan.

Currently, the number of students registered for both middle and primary school has reached more than two-thirds of the total capacity. In addition, the middle school plans to add a continuing education course for adult women starting next semester, with a tuition fee of only three yuan per semester.

Municipal Primary and Middle School: The Municipal Primary and Middle School on Wu Hu Road has been established for 18 years. Its students are known to thrive. It upholds the principle of providing education to those who are poor, without increasing tuition fees, and improving the salaries of teachers and staff.

The city's construction industry is enthusiastic about supporting it, and graduates will have excellent career prospects.

### United States Abrogates Trade Treaty with Japan, Japan and Germany Establish Trade Treaty

— Bao Le Di

In Tokyo negotiations, the United States abruptly abrogated the U.S.-Japan Commercial and Navigation Treaty established in 1911. This move did not occur during the U.S. Congressional discussion of this case this spring, but is now being implemented while the Anglo-Japanese so-called Tokyo negotiations are underway, revealing its political significance. As soon as this news spread, the Tokyo negotiations immediately stalled. Even without the U.S. abrogation, the Tokyo negotiations were inevitably doomed to fail; but the halt after the U.S. ripped up the U.S.-Japan trade treaty shows that the alignment of democratic countries on the Far East issue has not changed in the slightest due to Britain accepting the Tokyo negotiations. This is where the political significance of the U.S. abrogation of the trade treaty with Japan lies.

However, from an economic point of view, the consequences of the U.S. abrogating the trade treaty with Japan may be more severe than the blow it has given Japan on the international diplomatic stage.

First, from the perspective of the interests of the national economies of the two countries in their trade relations: Needless to say, Japan's main objectives in foreign trade, apart from obtaining raw materials and absorbing excess commodities from other countries in foreign markets, now include a more important objective, which is to obtain foreign exchange to purchase military supplies. Although Japan's trade with the United States has consistently been in deficit, the trade volume accounts for the top spot in its so-called "trade with third countries." Maintaining the main raw materials and tools for its export industries and military industries almost entirely relies on the United States. Before the war, large quantities of U.S. cotton, timber, and machine tools were imported; now, large quantities of U.S. steel, machinery, oil, copper, etc. are imported. Today, more than 90% of Japan's absolutely essential military raw materials and equipment rely on the United States, including copper and automobiles; more than 60% rely on the United States, including various fuels; and about 42% to 50% rely on the United States, including machinery and pig iron. Therefore, Japan must maintain its export market in the United States and maintain its purchase of military supplies from the United States and the necessary raw materials for export industries. Trade with the United States accounts for an absolute majority of Japan's "trade with third countries." Japan's trade volume with the five major powers of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy (unit: million Japanese yen)

(Note) Figures are cumulative for January to April of this year

This clearly points out that U.S.-Japan trade is not only the economic foundation for Japan's invasion of China, but also the condition for maintaining its entire national economy. Therefore, renowned journalist Gernway believed that "the invasion of China is the baby of the United States." Without U.S. supplies, Japan simply cannot invade China. Moreover, many experts have pointed out that the biggest shortcoming in Japan's industrial equipment is that it mostly uses American machinery. This highly mechanized production equipment requires even a single screw to be purchased from the original manufacturer. If the United States were to stop supplying, Japan's industrial activities could grind to a halt.

The second point to note: the trade of the three major democratic countries, Britain, the United States, and France, accounts for almost all of Japan's foreign trade. Its so-called German and Italian allies cannot provide any assistance to Japan's war economy or national economy, especially since they themselves rely on supplies from Britain, the United States, and others. Therefore, the U.S.'s sudden abrogation of the trade treaty with Japan has greatly shocked the Japanese government and public. Not only Japan, but also the German and Italian governments and public. This is why the Japanese-German trade treaty, which has been negotiated for almost two years, was able to be concluded so quickly. However, as shown in the table above, the trade relationship between Japan and Germany is really insignificant. Although Tokyo and Berlin believe that signing the German-Japanese trade treaty is a response to the U.S. abrogation of the U.S.-Japanese trade treaty, it is really too pathetic.

Negotiations for the Japanese-German trade treaty began in Berlin as early as last spring. At that time, Japan attempted to complete a joint Japanese-Manchurian treaty with Germany, but because the conflicts of interest in trade relations between Germany and Manchuria were not as severe as those in German-Japanese trade, the German-Manchurian trade treaty was established separately and was formally signed last September. Negotiations for the Japanese-German trade treaty have not been close ever since.

The first trade agreement between Japan and Manchuria was in April 1936. This was the initial performance of the anti-communist axis composed of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Economically, it was only because Japan attempted to use the export of special products from Northeast China to maintain its domestic purchasing power for Germany. Last year's plan to sign an integrated Japanese-Manchurian treaty with Germany had only this effect. Because Japan hoped to offset its own trade deficit with Germany with the trade surplus of Northeast China, it naturally hoped that Germany's exports to Manchuria would be as small as possible. This is one of the fundamental reasons for the conflicts of interest in trade between Germany and Japan.

Furthermore, Germany's exports to Manchuria are mostly daily industrial products and low-grade machinery that are in surplus in Germany; Japan hopes that Germany will import mainly military supplies, which are products that Germany itself has insufficient supply of. Of course, it is unwilling to supply others. This difference in the needs of trade products also determined the fate that trade between Germany and Japan is not easy to reconcile. At the same time, it is also the reason why the German-Manchurian trade treaty was finally established first and existed separately. We should also understand this German-Manchurian trade treaty.

The main content of the first German-Manchurian trade agreement was to stipulate that the annual trade volume between Germany and Manchuria should be 100 million Japanese yen. However, Germany only needs to pay three-quarters (75 million Japanese yen) of the foreign exchange in cash to Manchuria for imports from Manchuria; the remaining one-quarter (25 million Japanese yen) only needs to be recorded under Germany's debt to the Yokohama Specie Bank, which is offset by Germany's trade surplus with Japan.

In terms of Northeast China's export capacity, this total trade volume of 100 million Japanese yen only restricts Manchuria's exports to Germany and does not provide any benefits. However, in order to achieve its political conspiracy, Japan did not hesitate to sacrifice Manchuria's industries to sign the agreement. Manchurian exporters naturally opposed it, and Japanese importers also unanimously opposed it. Because restricting the trade volume of Northeast China means restricting the possibility of Northeast China's trade surplus, which also reduces the possibility of Japanese importers using the foreign exchange obtained from the Northeast China trade surplus to purchase goods from Germany. Therefore, in the new agreement established last autumn, Japan and Manchuria unanimously requested to expand the trade volume. Germany, due to the urgent need for internal demand, had strict restrictions on exports; therefore, it reluctantly agreed to expand the trade volume between Japan and Manchuria to 163 million Japanese yen. Since June of last year, Manchuria has greatly increased its exports to Germany in order to meet Japan's need for foreign exchange, and Germany has also tried to reduce its trade deficit with Manchuria and has also greatly increased its exports to Manchuria (which is actually Japan's disguised import). However, there is no room for adjustment in the trade relationship between Japan and Germany. Because Germany's required imports from Manchuria are limited to raw materials such as soybeans, soybean oil, and peanuts, and Japan's required imports are textiles, silk fabrics, aquatic products, and toys. These needs all have certain limits in Germany. However, Japan and Manchuria's required imports from Germany are machines, iron pots, and chemical products, which are also in extreme need in Germany itself and cannot be exported indefinitely. On the contrary, Germany has requested that Japan not restrict the import of surplus products such as cameras and medicines and maintain the import records before the war, but in Japan, which is suffering from a foreign exchange panic, these are regarded as unnecessary and non-urgent products and are strictly restricted from import. In addition, as a result of Japan's war against China, there is a large shortage of domestic labor, and general industrial activities are overwhelmed by military industry. Therefore, not only has production been drastically reduced, but exports related to military needs are also uniformly restricted. For this reason, while trade between Japan and Manchuria has勉强 increased, trade between Japan and Germany has plummeted. The trade contradictions caused by this fundamental conflict not only have not improved at all, but are becoming increasingly worse. Take a look at the table below to see the details (unit: 1,000 Japanese yen)

(Note) The first year is from June 1936 to May 1937, when the first German-Manchurian trade agreement was established; the second year is from June 1937 to May 1938, and the third year is from June 1938 to April 1939.

The fundamental relationship between the trade of Germany and Japan is already so opposed; not to mention that the conflicts of interest between Germany and Japan in the Chinese market are even more difficult to bridge. Since their interests are not easy to reconcile with each other, even if they are reconciled, their relationship in Japan's war economy and even national economy is still too small to enumerate. Therefore, the hasty signing of the new agreement this time will definitely end in failure, and its effect will be at most to slightly strengthen its momentum. However, the "momentum" reflected in this small trade record only makes people feel more pathetic.

### Regarding My Speech

— Yao Qingsan

Editor's Note: The most precious strength of a nation at war is unity of spirit. Has the spirit of all circles in Shanghai remained consistent from beginning to end? The public opinion circles bear a responsibility of rigorous oversight.

In the past week, all the economists staying in Shanghai unanimously sighed about the events revealed in the bi-monthly Economic Review published last Monday. It is understood that the target of the review seems to be Mr. Yao Qingsan, which is especially concerning because Mr. Yao is one of the outstanding economists in the country. The editor is one of them, and also a friend of Mr. Yao. Reading that rigorous and righteous review, I felt even more distressed.

However, after the editor read Mr. Yao's original manuscript of the speech, the heavy burden in my heart was relieved. However, everyone is still eager to read Mr. Yao's original manuscript of the speech to understand the truth; and Mr. Yao is even more willing to make his original manuscript of the speech public to prove the brightness of his position and to dispel doubts. Because the Economic Review could not be published immediately, Mr. Yao handed over a summary of the speech (because the original manuscript was more than 10,000 words long, and the position of this journal could not be fully published) to this journal for publication. I believe it will be welcomed by readers.

However, the editor personally has a few thoughts on this matter:

First: The most important thing in academic research is that the attitude must be pure, and the position must not allow any divergence. As for the inconsistency of academic ideas, this is unavoidable. What Mr. Yao talked about here is quite different from my humble opinion. Who is right and who is wrong? Only the judgment of historical facts has the most power.

Second: Freedom of speech should be promoted, but one should not avoid treatment for one's faults; but it must also be considered in terms of time and space; otherwise, it will not only easily cause misunderstandings, but also lead to bad consequences; however, this is often difficult for scholars who are bookish in nature. Therefore, the supervision of the public opinion circles is by no means superfluous, and it is absolutely necessary. But it must also strive to prevent unfortunate misunderstandings from occurring. If there is a misunderstanding, it should strive to eliminate it and avoid causing division.

Third: This event, in Shanghai Ecouomist and even among intellectuals, has the "rectification" significance of being the first of its kind. And it takes the nation's most outstanding scholars as the target; the relationship is very serious; the nature is perhaps completely different from ordinary debates. But the result is gratifying: because the solemn spirit of Shanghai's Ecouomist group has not been lost, but has been further emphasized because of this.

Fourth: Academic debate is indeed a necessary process for elucidating the truth. However, in Shanghai during this extraordinary period and environment, it is best to avoid its occurrence. In view of the Economic Review's editor's explanation that they had long considered the two letters from readers they received, and asked experts to study them; the seriousness of the attitude is conceivable. And when Mr. Yao made this summary of his speech, it was just after reading that review; it can also be said to be a period of being wronged; the bad mood is naturally in mind, but the writing still restrains his emotions, and in addition to publishing the main points of his speech, he does not adopt a debate method to defend his theory. It can be seen that both sides can care about the overall situation and do not engage in emotional disputes, so a cloud of doubt will surely disappear with the publication of this article. There is often the criticism of "scholars despising each other" in the world, but it has now proved that it no longer exists. This is indeed a great progress in the atmosphere of China's academic circles, or perhaps an extraordinary harvest under an extraordinary environment? (Zhang Yifan)

Two months ago, I was invited to give a speech at the Political Science Association of Soochow University and by President Hu Wenyao and Sun Ruihuang, who had read the original manuscript of the speech, and by the Law School of Aurora University. Unexpectedly, after a lapse of time, Mr. Tang Wenkai and Zhang Yifan made arrangements. It was originally unnecessary to spend words on corrections, but I was deeply afraid of causing misunderstandings from all parties, so I still published the manuscript of the speech at that time in summary to clarify the truth. This article is based on "Readers' Letters," but I absolutely cannot admit the various points mentioned in the "Readers' Letters."

 (1) My lectures at Soochow and Aurora Universities were purely academic discussions, and their content was the opposite of what was described in the "Readers' Letters." At the very least, this can be confirmed by Professor Zhang Sumin, who invited me to lecture at Soochow, and the current Mr. Tang, Mr. Wenkai, and Mr. Zhang Yifan at Aurora University. Moreover, the arguments were entirely focused on economics, and absolutely did not involve politics. I made a solemn statement at the beginning of the lecture, and I have never had any relationship with politics, so I have no opinion on political issues at all.

 (2) The Population Issue and the "Manchuria" Issue. My conclusion on the population issues of China and Japan is that while Japan does have a problem of overpopulation, China's overpopulation is even more serious. Japan wants to use "Manchuria" as an emigration destination, but "Manchuria" is Chinese territory and also China's lifeline. As for the solution to the "Manchuria" issue, according to strict logic, there are only three ways: (1) China naturally hopes to recover its lost territory, (2) Japan wants to turn it into a Japanese colony, (3) A compromise plan similar to the Lytton Investigation Team of the League of Nations. As for how it will be resolved, since the issue is beyond the realm of economics and concerns national policy, how dare I express any opinions.

 (3) The Yen Bloc Issue. I have always been skeptical of the "Yen Bloc." For detailed opinions, please refer to my recent article "From the Sterling Bloc to the Yen Bloc" published in the "Financial Review." I have also given speeches on this issue at Jiaotong University, Jinan University, and Daxia University, with records from the students of each university as proof.

 (4) Freedom and Control. Regarding post-war economic construction, given the necessity of using foreign capital, I advocate adopting a more liberal policy and do not approve of an absolute control policy. There is an original theoretical basis, and it goes without saying that any country should adopt a strict planned economy during wartime.

 (5) Industry and Agriculture. I believe that industrialization is a solution to China's population problem. Only in this way can the living standards of the Chinese people be expected to improve. Any force that attempts to suppress China's industrialization will be resolutely opposed by the Chinese people. However, because China's economic structure is still dominated by agriculture, in the immediate future, China should accelerate the process of industrialization, but in fact, agriculture will still occupy an important position temporarily.

 (6) Trade Issues. Free trade and protectionist trade have long been a contentious issue among economists in the West. I advocate that China should adopt a more liberal trade policy after the war to facilitate the import of necessities and the export of local products. Furthermore, the relatively free trade policy I advocate refers to all friendly countries and is based on equal and reciprocal trade agreements. Such opinions were originally individual freedom of thought and have nothing to do with political issues. Moreover, except for Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, in recent years, it has almost become a unanimous demand of economists in European and American democracies—including socialist economists—who believe it is an important step in solving the world's economic problems.

 (7) Investment Issues. Utilizing foreign capital was originally one of the national policies. The Central Political Conference had a decision on three principles. As for opening up the interior, it must be conditional on all countries abandoning extraterritoriality and foreigners truly abiding by Chinese laws (in fact, the National Government had the same provisions in the new treaties signed with Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Portugal, and Spain in 1928). Furthermore, if all countries can abandon extraterritoriality, and foreigners can truly abide by Chinese laws, although China can open up the interior, according to the established rules of civilized countries, the following rights should still be reserved: (1) Immigration Control Rights, (2) Agricultural Land Rights, (3) Transportation Rights, (4) Public Utility Rights, (5) Mining Rights, (6) Fishing Rights, (7) Munitions Manufacturing Rights, (8) Other Special Industry Control Rights. My above opinions were originally based entirely on the conventions of international treaties. Although it is not the time to discuss them, it is not impossible to conduct academic research on them. It is regrettable that the reviewer did not observe this and misunderstood.

The above are the truths of my lectures at Soochow and Aurora Universities, and what I want to disclose is these truths only. As for other words that are used as excuses to make an issue, facts speak louder than words, so why should I say more? Scholarship and morality are the most precious, and emotional words are not what I want to say!

### The Future of the Japanese Economy

— Translated by Ms. Feng Meiqi

Japan's Economic Outlook by T.A. Bisson Froeign Poliy Report Vol. XV, No. 7 Jun. 15, 1939.

The recent developments in Xiamen and Shanghai show that the attitude of the great powers towards Japan's aggression in the Far East has become tougher. When the Japanese army occupied the Gulangyu concession, the navies of the British, American, and French cruisers landed on May 17th and 18th to protect it. The United States also sent a note to Japan, strongly protesting the Japanese demands for administrative power in the Shanghai concession. Over the past eight months, Japan's attacks on European and American interests have continued to increase; from the occupation of Guangzhou and Hainan Island to the attacks on concessions, it has now reached its peak.

As the European crisis is approaching, the actions of the Japanese are becoming more important. Although their strength is still sufficient to influence the two major forces in the world, it has been greatly reduced compared to two years ago. The scope of its actions has been limited by China's protracted war. During the First World War, the Japanese were able to act freely in the Far East and seize the interests of Europe and the United States. Today it is not the same. What the Japanese can obtain will depend on their military, political, and economic achievements in China, and their domestic economic strength.

Although the Japanese have achieved some military victories in China, they are not true victories for Japan. After the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident in 1937, the war soon spread throughout the country, and there is no end in sight. Guerrillas in the occupied areas are quite active. The regular army under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek has never wavered. As the war has expanded, it has become more difficult for the Japanese to defeat the main force of the Chinese army, and the retreat of the Chinese army to the interior is becoming more and more unfavorable to the Japanese.

Before a thorough military solution is achieved, the Japanese can only achieve partial political and economic success in China. Even the Japanese are unwilling to formally recognize the puppet governments they have repeatedly established. Economic development can only proceed smoothly after political stability is achieved. Now that the Japanese have not yet won, if a Second World War breaks out, it will inevitably be greatly hindered by the prolongation of the war in China.

The impact of the war on Japan's economy and finance is difficult to estimate. When the Japanese Diet passed the military budget in the summer of 1937, it believed that the war would end and peace talks would be held after the fall of Shanghai and Nanjing. The result was not realized. Later, the Japanese Diet passed an unprecedented huge military budget. The huge amount of military supplies imported has also put serious pressure on Japanese commerce and exchange rates. If war breaks out and Japan is opposed to the Western democracies, its import and export markets will inevitably be cut off, and the result will undoubtedly aggravate the domestic economic crisis.

Japan's Domestic Economy

Under the pressure of wartime needs, several complex problems have arisen in Japan's domestic economy: the expansion of the budget has increased taxes, domestic debt has also increased unprecedentedly, the increase in paper money issuance has affected currency stability, and prices have also risen considerably. Japan's ability to avoid the threat of inflation depends entirely on its ability to increase agricultural and industrial production to meet the huge wartime financial needs.

Table (1) shows the increase in Japan's financial burden since the outbreak of the war. The budgets for 1931 to 1933 were based on the Miseits government's "inflation relief" policy. Most of its expenses came from taxes and other income, and borrowing accounted for a small number. The budgets for the next five years were drafted by Minister of Finance Takahashi. The amount of borrowing has increased, but has never exceeded 75.3 million yen. Commerce has been quite prosperous during these five years, and the increase in government spending has allowed idle labor and capital to be fully utilized. Normal tax revenues continued to increase, and a business profit tax was re-imposed from 1935 to 1936, earning 2.6 million in that year and 4.2 million in the following year. At that time, the national debt increased from 61.88 million to 105.75 million, an increase of 43.87 million, or 70 percent.

The last three years of the budget in Table (2) are in sharp contrast to the Japanese finance in the Takahashi era. The figures for 1937 to 1938 include half a year of war expenses. The following two years include the full year's war budget. The expenses for 1939 to 1940 are almost double those before the outbreak of the war. The borrowings for 1938 to 1939 and 1939 to 1940 are almost double those for 1936 to 1937. The increase in taxes is equally significant. Tax revenues increase by about half a trillion every three years. The estimate for 1939 to 1940 is 153.2 million yen, an increase of 150 percent compared to the year before the war. In that year, in addition to increasing taxes, it was still necessary to issue 565.2 million yen in public bonds to make up for the budget deficit.

How to issue this huge amount of public bonds without affecting its economic operations is an important issue for Japan's wartime finance. The actual public bonds sold are often lower than the budget estimates. Public bonds issued in the 1937 to 1938 fiscal year totaled 22.30 million yen. Public bonds issued in the 1938 to 1939 fiscal year, to February 1939, totaled 43.00 million yen. The budget for the first eighteen months after the outbreak of the war should have issued 89.4 million yen in public bonds, but only 65.4 million yen were actually sold.

The difficulty in selling public bonds can be seen in the increase in the amount held by the Bank of Japan. The numbers held in the past three years are shown in Table (2). The second item is the amount of public bonds that the bank has undertaken but not digested. The Oriental Economic Journal said: "In 1938, public bonds were issued for 43.50 million yen, while the Bank of Japan's holdings increased by more than 50 million yen. That is, 15.7 percent were not digested, and the situation does not seem to be optimistic." In addition to national borrowing, private groups needed to borrow 40.00 million yen in 1938. Although national savings reached 80.00 million yen in 1938, they were not enough to fully consume the government's public bonds. And the increase in production is extremely small, then the increase in national savings may be due to the depreciation of the currency value, and the previous savings are also part of it (to be continued).

### Disguised Foreign Currency

— Mu Weng

Yesterday, this newspaper's local news reported: Someone suggested issuing a new Shanghai currency based on British gold, with a value of eight pence, and it is said that many foreign businessmen agree. Shanghai is my country's only trading port. Since the opening of the port, Chinese and foreign transactions have been based on my country's currency. Although foreign banks have taken advantage of the "worship of foreign countries" mentality in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China to issue banknotes, since the issuance of banknotes by Chinese banks, after Yuan Shikai's selfishness in the third year of the Republic of China, the exchange of Chinese banknotes was stopped. At that time, Mr. Song Hanzhang, the president of the Bank of China in Shanghai, did not accept the chaotic order and continued to exchange normally, which made the credit of the Bank of China's banknotes last until today. The same banknote seems to be valuable for the Bank of China's banknotes, which shows the great effect of this move and the deep impression. After the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai, the awareness of national economy became stronger, and the scope of use of foreign bank banknotes became narrower and eventually disappeared. After the implementation of legal tender, the issuance of banknotes was centralized, which was convenient for all industries and made circulation more convenient. Now foreign merchants often shrink sharply because of the foreign exchange black market, only care about their current interests, regardless of the difficulties of the absolute majority of Chinese people in Shanghai, and increase prices again and again, such as public utilities, has enjoyed a monopoly treatment, although coal prices have risen, but not suddenly increased, and price increases frequently, monetary concepts, egoism is too strong, so regardless of the burden of the public, and this does not meet their desires, but also want to use China's few import industry and a few wealthy funds to escape the mentality, afraid that the legal tender will continue to fall, afraid that prices will not rise, afraid that their business security is not individual, and can only exercise its nature equal to the foreign currency in the Shanghai market suggestions, if adopted this statement, even to implement it will destroy my country's monetary system, It will inevitably make the circulation of legal tender in Shanghai greatly hindered, and speculation will occur between legal tender and new currency. Making the already unified monetary system become non-unified also undermines the British authorities' promise to maintain legal tender. Since Shanghai is a local place in my country, and legal tender is the world-recognized currency of my country, we should use my country's currency in my country's territory, and we should not issue a new currency separately. Chinese and foreign merchants want to seek trade development, and often cooperate to stabilize foreign exchange and consolidate the foundation of legal tender, and not help the tyrant to do evil, and there is an indirect action to destroy legal tender is the long-term benefit.

### Chinese and Foreign Artillery

China used stone artillery in ancient times, and now uses fire artillery. The system of stone artillery began with Xuanyuan, and Fan Li used the method of flying stones, Li Mi used the attack of Guangyun artillery, and Yanshou threw stones by hand, Hao Zhao used ropes to transport stones, and Zhuge Liang used siege vehicles to break through the formation. All of them were the most famous users of stone artillery in later generations. The system of fire artillery began with Yuan Shizu obtaining Western Regions fire artillery and using it to attack Caizhou city. Ming Dynasty sought its system more widely and became the ancestor of a generation of fire artillery. In the Yongle period, the Shenji artillery was obtained and specially placed in the Shenji camp, while the General Cannon used carts, and the Yihu artillery and Baizi artillery used frames. In the fourteenth year of Zhengtong, Yu Shan asked to cast two-headed copper artillery, each containing ten bullets. During the Jingtai period, Shi Xiang made a machine with milling, which fired three times in a moment and could reach three hundred steps away. In the third year of Tianshun, Canjiang Fang Yongyan said that he used firearms to break the enemy, named Jiulong Tong, which fired nine arrows simultaneously in one burning. In the eighth year of Jiajing, Youdu Yushi Wang Hong praised the benefits of the Folangji. At the end of Zhengde, Guangyuan obtained its system and made it of copper, five or six feet long, with the larger ones weighing a thousand catties and the smaller ones weighing one hundred and fifty catties. It had a huge belly and a long neck, with a Xiu hole in the belly, with five sub-cannons, loaded with medicine and placed in its belly for firing. It was also beneficial for naval battles and was driven by centipede boats. It was invincible wherever it went. Bai Sha's patrol inspector He Xu obtained its method and ordered it to be made and sent to various borders, calling it the General Cannon. In the nineteenth year of Wanli, the late Governor Huang Yingyong said that the General Cannon weighed hundreds of catties, but it was very difficult to use. Later people imitated it and made it empty, using hemp ropes to string it with medicine bullets. It was light and easy to lift, and the cost was also saved. Later, when Western ships arrived, they obtained a huge cannon called Hongyi, which was more than two feet long and weighed up to three thousand catties. When fired, it could crack stone walls and shock dozens of miles. According to the use of iron cannons, as far as China is concerned, ancient times are not as good as today. Compared with Western countries, China is not as precise as Western countries. Now, observing the artillery of Prussia, it changes monthly and innovates daily. The reason is that they abandon the old and seek the new, and they are constantly researching. The Chinese people used to know the precision of French artillery, but now they know that Prussian artillery is even more precise.

Before the Battle of Wuhan’s Outskirts was launched, Dabie Mountain seemed very unfamiliar, just like Dahong Mountain, Taihang Mountain, and Zhongtiao Mountain, not arousing people's universal interest; moreover, it had never received praise from any poet, so it had to let Mount Lu and other mountains steal the limelight. However, this nameless hero was preparing with a posture of devouring everything, complex paths, overlapping ridges, and deep valleys that would make people's heads ache, and cause them to sigh, "It's impossible to go!"; otherwise, Wuhan has been occupied for more than nine months, why hasn't a single grass or tree been damaged, isn't this obvious evidence?

Its overall appearance is like this: Starting from Tongbai Mountain, it meanders southeast, passing through Henan and Hubei provinces and entering Anhui, directly connected to the Anhui Mountains, becoming the watershed between the Yangtze River and the Huai River. The eastern part extends into Yingshan County, Anhui Province, and then turns northeast from Huoshan, entwined in Qianshan, with the main peak reaching 6,500 feet, each being Tianzhu Mountain. The northern branch extends eastward from Hefei, ending at Zhangbaling. If we put it symbolically, it resembles a crouching warrior, with two arms like steel chains extending into Henan and Hubei, and a torso cast from pig iron standing tall in western Anhui. It's not that we intentionally exaggerate; during the previous "encirclement" period, three routes were taken to advance, and the route that advanced from Shangcheng through Suxianshi was blocked at Gouji Ridge, the other two routes were blocked at Songzi Pass and frustrated at Yangliudian, neither able to cross the Lei Pool even a step. So, using the past as an example for the present, even if one could enter, it would be hopeless to get out.

That day, we arrived at Zaoxie River, and looking from afar, Gouji Ridge appeared in the clouds, so we rushed to Zhangdian in the early coolness in one breath.

Bu, bu, bu...,

The sound of rifles suddenly echoed from the mountain hollow, because in the surrounding deep mountains, the sound seemed particularly loud, and it continued to fire.

"What's going on?" Little Shen asked in surprise.

"Maybe they've attacked Dabie Mountain!" Old Yao said mockingly.

Then, there was a burst of laughter. When we crossed the ridge and appeared opposite the pine forest, two teams of warriors were practicing field combat, a stone, a tree, and a pile of dirt were all used as cover for assault. They lay prone on the grass, assumed aiming poses, and simultaneously surveyed, moved, and chased cautiously. After half an hour, they began to withdraw. Looking at the insignia on their sleeves, we knew they belonged to General Feng Zhi'an's troops. Through mutual singing and introductions, we began talking to the captain, from the fall of Beiping to the transfer to western Anhui for defense.

### Literary Construction

— Yang Yanqi

There is no need to give any definitions or explanations. Literature and art are not technology. This should be universally known to those who understand literature and art. Since it is technology, there should be no such thing as construction or destruction. However, literature and art have their own constructiveness and also have the ability to destroy. Because no one can deny: literature and art, in the hands of people, can be used as tools, and can also be used as weapons. And in fact, everything so-called "tool" in the world is precisely another way of saying "weapon."

For example, wartime literature and art, regardless of whether it directly reflects or exposes, should at least be able to stand on the foundation of construction. War is of course a material war, but psychologically it is an active construction. The battlefield is a scene of ashes, and although more than ten thousand elite soldiers are killed or wounded, we are left with a profound concept of struggle. The longer the war lasts, the greater the material losses, and the more determined the resolve to fight. Isn't this construction? This construction, in its promotion, requires the help of literature and art.

Conversely, construction necessarily involves destruction. To build a building of more than ten stories, one must first level the soil on the ground, and also deeply penetrate the foundation. To build a new era in literature and art, one must first eliminate the old dregs. This is originally a reasonable statement, and no one can deny it. However, in reality, people often forget that new products need old fertilizers to cultivate, and new construction needs old gardens to serve. At the same time, we cannot cut our feet to fit the shoes and remove everything that is not our own construction. Our construction is in our construction, and the construction of others should also grow. A good garden only grows one kind of flower, especially in the literary and artistic garden, as long as it is not a pest, there is no reason why it cannot be accommodated.

Talking about literature and art will naturally involve thought. When thought is involved, it may not be in line with the goal of construction. Construction is naturally not backward, not regressive, and does not necessarily shout loudly, only seeking that its voice be heard ten or a hundred miles away. Construction is in the production of new forms, not in the mutual exchange of clichés. In construction, there is no reason to exclude others, and there is no need to lead those with ulterior motives down the same path. Literature and art have thought, and thought has its own subjectivity. Sometimes the tip of subjectivity is a sharp blade; this sharp blade should be used on the enemies of the opposing camp, not to suppress brothers who are also in production and construction. Whether it is an individual or a group, as long as the "individual" does not forget their position, or the "group" is not selfish, they are all construction. If one can't wait to be the leader and wants to suppress the success of others and prevent the progress of others, then not only is one not building, but even actively destroying.

The same is true in the realm of literature and art.

To open up barren gardens, to build solemn palaces, or to produce a great work, there is a common goal: that is, authenticity. Empty shouting will not work, and waving flags empty-handed will not work either. If the throat is shouted hoarse and the drum surface is pierced, where is the achievement of construction? Ideal? Illusion? Mr. Lu Xun once admonished his son in his will, saying not to be an empty-headed literary artist. What is an empty-headed literary artist? Simply put, it is a literary artist who does not engage in construction.

Construction is construction. There is no paper tiger that is successful forever. We should bring literature and art to the mountains and plains of war to depict the mask of the times; but we cannot bring the form of war into the realm of literature and art to engage in struggles of contention and harm. What is needed in the realm of literature and art is construction, not the destruction of construction. The masses are in front of us, urgently awaiting the construction of new war weapons and new food supplies.

Being detached, not fighting with others, indifferently transcending the world, all kinds of attitudes are what we do not need; and literature and art that undermine the rear and stir up trouble with words are even greater enemies of ours today.

The country is in active progress, and is waiting for the construction in the literary and artistic garden to flourish.

Many mountains are suitable for prolonged battles; a vast land can endure a long march. Who can achieve victory? It will ultimately be as clear as the sun.

### Two Prose Poems

— Chuan Gen

Phantom

A shadow is depicted in the forest, like a cloud? Like twilight? Like a pool of still water? Like hazy twilight? Like the spring sun? ... But it looks like nothing, it is the most cruel desolation in the world.

I reached out to touch it, but unexpectedly, my hands were buried in the melancholy, empty darkness, and in a daze, I lost the dream of a lifetime.

In the mountains and forests, there is still a haze.

The wind spread the dust, blew off the wheat stalks, withered the grass, stirred the spring water, and blew away the gloomy wilderness, but it could not penetrate the phantom-like life.

Lonely tree shadow, you ask me: "What time is it?"

"..." I looked up at you.

I wanted to say: "Anyway, it's a sunny day."

But I said this instead: "The real sun no longer shines."

"Then, is it all darkness?" you asked again. ';I tell you: "The phantom of life is originally buried in darkness. Strange music

In the quiet night, I wore starlight and stepped on dew, looking for some lost sounds.

But there was nothing on the desolate land.

So I wrapped my disappointed soul and leisurely crossed the small bridge.

In the distance, a burst of music floated:

Although the night is long,

It cannot bury our daytime,

The south wind brings us

The news of dawn:

Lonely passerby,

Don't linger in disappointment anymore!

Oh, I found it, this kind voice, this strange music lingering on the walls of my heart.

The dawn has risen slightly in the clouds, I am walking forward, stepping on the exciting and victorious footsteps, and closely following my feet is the dawn.

Enthusiasm

Who among young people is not filled with excessive enthusiasm? If it is lacking, it is a morbid state.

Enthusiasm is like a bonfire, burning fiercely, illuminating the road in the vastness; in this cold world, it gives people the heat of life and the courage of life.

Enthusiasm should also be cherished, used well, and not wasted in vain. It should be vented on sacred causes. Rely on youth to do more of what young people should do, after all, freedom is more precious.

"The sacrifice at Nanyuan was really too great!" I said.

"That's right, especially the students who were just training," he said with regret, "their boiling blood did not demand a corresponding price!"

"Then how did you escape?" Little Shen couldn't help but interject.

"No, no," the captain replied, "I was defending Yongdingmen and retreated to Nankou with the main force."

In the sound of the military flute as they continued to practice, we left Zhangdian.

### Farewell to You Fan

— Liu Lan

Water connects to the sky, the sky connects to the water, a vast ocean. A ship cuts out a line of waterway like a sharp knife, the sea spitting out white foam painfully along the wound. The thick chimney proudly spews out wisps of smoke, heading towards the blue sky (Madeli-like sky).

Sitting at the farewell banquet, I have distant imaginations. There are graceful smoke rings in front of me.

"University of Michigan by Lake Michigan, Michigan." He said this amusing address. So, someone wrote it down, "It's a lake, not a river, the lake of the lakeside poets." He corrected, "You have to write in English."

"Lakeside Poets," I grabbed these four words. Our friend is also a poet. But, I don't know if he likes Wordsworth. I heard that his poems are all praises of life, but unfortunately I have read very few, and my impression is weaving skill and delicacy. My opinion is that it should be written more rudely and simply. The conscience of art should and must be upright, regarding the current

Current topics are like lake water, flowing arbitrarily, one sentence here, one sentence there, one laugh followed by another. I am silent, strangely silent. "Why don't you speak?" I smiled, looking at the graceful smoke rings.

"Will you still love literature and art in four years? - What you love now"

"I think so. But maybe I will write more prose."

"That's good, but I'm afraid it's difficult?" I knew he was going to study business administration

"Will you still remember us? What about the motherland?"

"Of course I will, and I will remember the motherland even more. Over there, I will do what I can do."

We all laughed, young people's laughter, brightly.

So, we talked about our ages and birthdays, I am the third brother, he is the fourth brother. We have older brothers, younger brothers, and a sixth sister. Holding hands, tightly. We laughed loudly again. The chairs also laughed creakily.

Law

### Notice to Readers

This year's Labor Day, at the request of the Central Daily News, this association will edit "Law." The beginning of its publication coincides with the eve of the 10th anniversary of the establishment of this association. Looking back over the past ten years, this association's focus on law has been limited to discussions and exchanges among colleagues. Although occasional research results have been offered to the legislative authorities, it has not been able to universally serve the general public. Since Shen Bao has entrusted the editorial duties, we are deeply pleased to have the opportunity to serve, so we resolutely accepted the task, and assigned more than ten members to specialize in it, so as to show that we are not perfunctory.

When "Law" was published, several matters were announced, namely, to support legal justice, promote the spirit of the rule of law, collect materials for research at any time, and popularize legal common sense to the public. It has only been three months since then. Colleagues have worked diligently and readers have enthusiastically supported, all taking this as their common goal, and striving to reach the final goal. However, the evolution of events is something that cannot be predicted. The current economic situation is changing rapidly, turbulent and unstable. Although the current financial turmoil was caused by speculators seeking profit, the result has been rising prices, with paper prices doubling compared to the past. The Shen Bao authorities, in this difficult situation, still uphold their past spirit as a mouthpiece for the people. However, with so many weekly publications, the cost is naturally huge. Since there is no supply of domestic goods, they have to seek ways to remedy the situation. Therefore, various weekly publications will be temporarily suspended. This "Law," which was born just three months ago, will also be temporarily separated from the readers. Shen Bao is in a difficult situation to continue, and this association has a heart full of helplessness. We know that readers will also have the same feeling.

It is also fair to say that, although "Law" has only been published for a short time, we have never slacked in our cultivation and irrigation. All research and commentary works have grasped the center of the times and expressed sincere opinions. Even the columns of judgments and official documents have tried their best to collect widely, hoping to provide practical help. As for the answers to questions, based on laws and regulations, considering the circumstances and reasoning, without being tired of seeking details, all have been witnessed by readers. Although we are suddenly saying goodbye to you today, the time is inevitably too short, but precisely because the time is short, it is worth savoring. The Shen Bao authorities certainly do not want this phenomenon to last forever, and the members of this association also urgently want to have another opportunity to contribute their efforts. Therefore, readers may wish to slightly reduce their reluctance to say goodbye, and the day of reunion is not far away.

Now, as we temporarily part ways, we offer a word, hoping that readers will understand and appreciate it!

Research and Criticism

### A Study on the Non-Competition Obligation of Company Directors

— Zhou Kun

Our Civil Code and Company Law stipulate that the manager of a firm and the unlimitedly liable shareholder of an unlimited company may not, without the permission of the firm (Article 562 of the Civil Code) or the unanimous consent of the other shareholders of the unlimited company (Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the Company Law), operate a business of the same kind as the company themselves or for others, nor may they be an unlimitedly liable shareholder of a company of the same kind. However, the firm (Article 563 of the Civil Code) or more than half of the other shareholders of the unlimited company (Article 28, Paragraph 2 of the Company Law) may regard the actions they have taken for themselves or others as actions taken by the company. The legal provisions are very clear and unambiguous. However, whether the director of a limited company is also subject to the non-competition obligation is a matter that is worthy of study.

The director of a limited company is the shareholder who represents the company and executes its business. Therefore, whether they are a director specifically representing the company externally or a director executing business internally, they all have extensive powers and heavy responsibilities. They are deeply familiar with all the internal details of the company's business. If they use this knowledge to operate the same kind of business for themselves or others, and compete with the company, or become an unlimitedly liable shareholder of another company, then the company will inevitably be significantly affected, and all shareholders will suffer disadvantages. Therefore, in order to prevent conflicts of interest and fulfill their responsibilities, they should all be subject to the non-competition obligation.

Article 158 of our old company regulations stipulated that directors may each represent the company, and the provisions on non-competition obligation were placed in paragraph 2 of that article. Therefore, all directors should be subject to it, and there is no problem. However, after examining Article 145, Paragraph 1 of our Company Law, it stipulates that "the company may, in accordance with the articles of association or the resolution of the shareholders' meeting, designate one or more directors to represent the company," and Paragraph 2 stipulates that "the provisions of Articles 28 and 31 to 33 shall apply mutatis mutandis to directors." The legal text on non-competition obligation is placed after the directors specifically representing the company, so it seems that only the directors specifically representing the company should be subject to the provisions on non-competition obligation. Other directors executing business can be unrestricted. I believe that if such an interpretation is made, it will be inappropriate in terms of legal principles and human feelings. The director executing business is the highest administrative organ of the company internally. Even the appointment and dismissal of managers is within their power (Article 144 of the Company Law). If they can be unrestricted, then if they engage in private fraud and do whatever they want, the abuses will be endless and the harm will be immeasurable. Not only will they fail to protect the interests of other shareholders, but it will also not be a blessing for the commercial society. Moreover, it clearly violates the strict legislative intention of Article 28 of the Company Law, which stipulates that all shareholders executing business are uniformly subject to the non-competition obligation. Furthermore, managers are selected and appointed by directors and are still subject to the non-competition obligation, while directors executing business, whose powers are higher than those of managers, can be unrestricted. This is also quite contradictory in terms of reason. I am afraid that the legislation often has negligence regarding the technique of legal provision structure. To prevent disputes, we can only wait for the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan.

The fact that directors should be subject to the non-competition obligation has been stated above. As for how directors can engage in the same kind of business, and how to exercise sanctions when the non-competition obligation is violated, there is also a need for explanation in law. I will divide them into the following:

(A) How can directors engage in the same kind of business? Article 28, Paragraph 1 of our Company Law stipulates that "shareholders may not, without the consent of all other shareholders, engage in acts of operating a business of the same kind as the company for themselves or others, or be an unlimitedly liable shareholder of another company." However, what is stipulated in that article refers to the shareholders of an unlimited company. Therefore, it says "the consent of all other shareholders." If a limited company and an unlimited company have different structures, the application will often be inconsistent. Since the number of shareholders of a limited company is certainly very large unless it is established by promoters, it is factually impossible to obtain "the consent of all other shareholders." Therefore, if a director of a limited company wants to engage in the same kind of business, the phrase "without the consent of all other shareholders" should, in the author's opinion, be interpreted as "without the resolution of the shareholders' meeting." That is, more than half of the shareholders representing more than half of the total number of shares must be present, and the resolution must be passed by more than half of the voting rights of those present (Article 100, Paragraph 2 and Article 128, Paragraph 2 of the Company Law).

(B) How to exercise sanctions when the non-competition obligation is violated? Article 28, Paragraph 2 of our Company Law stipulates that "when a shareholder violates the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the other shareholders may, by a resolution of more than half, regard the acts they have taken for themselves or others as belonging to the company, but this shall not apply after one year from the act." The phrase "a resolution of more than half of the other shareholders" also refers to the sanctions against shareholders of an unlimited company. In the author's opinion, when sanctioning directors of a limited company, in addition to the resolution of the shareholders' meeting being naturally valid, other provisions of the Company Law can also be invoked, namely: First, the supervisor (Article 160 of the Company Law); Second, shareholders holding more than one-tenth of the total number of shares (Article 150 of the Company Law) can all directly exercise their rights, so as to avoid the various procedures of convening a shareholders' meeting and requiring a resolution of the shareholders' meeting, thereby achieving the effect of quick use of power. However, I have something that is inappropriate, and I hope that scholars at home will teach me. Research on ownership

### Study of Ownership

— Zheng Baohua

Reading the inaugural address in the first issue of this publication on May 1st, it stated that there are four methods for studying law: first, the philosophical method; second, the analytical method; third, the historical method; and fourth, the sociological method. Among these four, using philosophical, analytical, and historical methods to study law all have their shortcomings. If one seeks perfection and accuracy, there is no other way than to apply the sociological method. This statement is quite insightful and serves as a guiding light for those studying law who are unsure of which method to choose. Observing legal phenomena or exploring their results from a sociological perspective yields different results than those obtained through philosophical, analytical, or historical methods. Moreover, because it is obtained through the sociological method, it can be integrated with actual society, avoiding the criticism of "building a cart behind closed doors" or "cutting the feet to fit the shoes." This article will discuss the foundation of ownership theory based on the above opinions.

What is the basis for the establishment of initial ownership? Why is ownership in principle inviolable? On this, scholars have different views due to their different methods of studying law. Some advocate the "first occupancy theory," some the "labor theory," some the "legal definition theory," some the "needs theory," some the "economic theory," some the "human nature theory," and finally, some the "evolutionary theory." There is much debate and no consensus. It is lamentable that without a clear understanding of research methods, one will inevitably be dizzy and confused, not knowing what to do. Now, the main points of these various theories are listed below:

The first occupancy theory states that originally, all objects were unowned. Whoever first applies their intention and physical strength to an unowned object and occupies it acquires ownership of the object and can exclude the interference of others. This recognizes first occupancy as the basis for originally acquiring ownership of movable or immovable property.

The labor theory recognizes that the original acquisition of ownership of an object is entirely due to human labor. This means that ownership is entirely derived from production. For example, unowned wasteland is acquired through reclamation, minerals are acquired through mining, and other newly produced objects created by labor changing raw materials all belong to this category.

The legal definition theory recognizes that the original acquisition of ownership and its inviolability are both granted by law. If the law does not protect ownership, then ownership may be difficult to continue to exist.

The needs theory believes that the fundamental reason for the occurrence of ownership is that people have various desires that need to be satisfied. The desire to satisfy these desires must be filled through the method of ownership of things. This is the function of ownership.

The economic theory recognizes that ownership has its place and can exist because it is beneficial to the social economy. The initial cause of ownership is also due to its benefit to the social economy. This theory and the aforementioned needs theory both belong to the economic aspect of the argument.

The human nature theory recognizes that ownership arises from human nature. Humans cannot maintain their lives and develop physically and mentally without using external objects to support themselves. Therefore, the initial fact of the existence of ownership is entirely due to human nature, recognizing that objects should not be obtained by force, and that people should respect each other's ownership of things obtained through labor, which is a necessary condition for human survival and development. This is what the human nature theory considers to be the origin of ownership.

As for those who advocate the evolutionary theory, they believe that ownership exists because it actually adapts to the changing evolution of social life.

Now that the main points of the various theories have been clarified, we will now criticize the merits and demerits of the above theories from the perspective of the latest sociology. However, the purpose of this article is to prove that applying the sociological method is superior to other methods. As for whether our criticism of the theories is appropriate and which of the above theories is most appropriate, it cannot be said that there is no room for different opinions. From a sociological perspective, the idea of first occupancy is not clear enough. Is it limited to the scope of physical strength? Or any scope within the reach of mental strength? Moreover, first occupancy is only a fact and is not enough to explain the origin of ownership. For example, making wood into a boat, casting iron into wheels, melting copper into a bowl, or fermenting grapes into wine to obtain ownership of the boat, wheels, bowl, and wine is the result of labor, not through first occupancy. Moreover, according to Article 814 of the current Civil Code, "If a person processes movable property of another, the ownership of the processed object belongs to the owner of the materials, but if the value added by the processing clearly exceeds the value of the materials, the ownership of the processed object belongs to the processor." Therefore, when the processor obtains ownership according to this article, it has nothing to do with first occupancy. Conversely, if labor is regarded as the only source of acquiring ownership, it is also not correct. There are many cases in the world where people gain without labor or obtain huge ownership with minimal labor. Because processing the property of others, except in the circumstances of Article 814 of the aforementioned Civil Code, generally cannot obtain ownership. Moreover, land is not fundamentally created by human labor, but merely by cultivating and farming on the surface of the land. Therefore, the ownership of the land itself is not entirely related to labor. As for the legal definition theory, it ignores that ownership actually exists before the law. Because it has legitimate and inviolable reasons, the law then protects it. If ownership is created by law, it is inevitable to stick to legal formalities and ignore the spirit of the law, abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial. According to the needs theory, human desires are difficult to satisfy, and greedy people will use this as a talisman to start disputes and robberies, and how can order be maintained? Moreover, it ignores the function of labor in the composition of ownership, so it is also inappropriate. The economic theory recognizes that the social economy develops due to the existence of ownership, which also seems to be a specious argument. The existence of individual ownership also hinders the social economy, such as large landowners having tenants cultivate their land and only collecting their profits. The evolutionary theory uses evolution to explain the origin of ownership, while ignoring the universal and unchanging principles of human nature. It is a fact that ownership changes with the times, but this is only a change and not the cause of the creation of ownership. So how does ownership occur and where is its source? If we infer it by the sociological research method, the human nature theory seems to be the most appropriate. Ownership changes with the necessities or interests of group life, and group life originates from human nature, so ownership also arises from human nature. Aristotle said, "Man is a social animal." Hobbes said, "Everyone fights each other, which is human nature." It can be seen that human beings inherently have a heart of love and a feeling of hatred. Respecting the ownership of others is caused by this heart of love; repelling the interference of others with one's own ownership is caused by this feeling of hatred. Without the above-mentioned natural human nature, ownership would be difficult to occur. Since we determine the origin of ownership based on human nature, we will further study it from the perspective of sociology. Although we know that ownership is a necessary condition for the survival and development of each individual, and each individual must have the freedom to acquire ownership, when exercising this freedom, it must be limited to the scope of not infringing on the ownership of others, and it must be done through legitimate means. This is why the exercise of ownership is generally limited in the progressive civil laws of various countries. If rights are not exercised for a long time, such as allowing land to be barren and not cultivating it, it is recognized as anti-social behavior, and the law intervenes to force its exercise. As for the abuse of rights, the laws of various countries have more express provisions to restrict it. The disposal of property, due to social relations, in certain circumstances, cannot allow the freedom of the owner, such as even if it is the industry completely owned by the husband, when his ownership is transferred to others, the consent and participation of his wife must be obtained. The current civil law of our country also has express provisions on the restrictions on the exercise of ownership, such as Article 765 of the Civil Law of Property Rights stipulates, "Within the scope of legal restrictions, the owner may freely use and dispose of his property and exclude the interference of others," and Article 773 stipulates, "The ownership of land, unless otherwise restricted by law, extends to the upper and lower parts of the land within the scope of its beneficial exercise. Interference by others that does not hinder the exercise of its ownership may not be excluded." Also, Article 793 stipulates, "When the owner of land has gas, steam, odor, smoke, heat, ash, noise, agitation, and other similar intrusions into the land of others, he may prohibit it, but this does not apply if the intrusion is minor, or if the land shape and local customs deem it appropriate," and Article 790 stipulates, "The owner of land may prohibit others from entering his land, but this does not apply in the following circumstances: 1. Others have the right of passage. 2. According to local customs, others are allowed to enter unfenced fields, pastures, and mountains to cut weeds, collect dead branches, or collect wild animals, or graze livestock." Article 791, paragraph 1 stipulates, "When the owner of land encounters the articles or animals of others occasionally entering his land, he shall allow the possessor or owner of the articles or animals to enter it to search for and retrieve it." These are all provisions belonging to the restriction of ownership. The legislative reasons for all these provisions are nothing more than recognizing that the law is based on society, recognizing that today's society is a fusion of many people, that is, people are closely related and inseparable, and that there is a close relationship of mutual assistance between individuals, resulting in the emergence of social solidarity. The above-mentioned various restrictions on ownership are also based on social solidarity and recognize public interest as more important and individual interest as less important. Therefore, if we can study the law of modern ownership by the method of sociology, it will be easier to understand. If we apply other philosophical, analytical, historical, and other methods, it is still difficult to avoid discrepancies. The purpose of this article is to prove through the point of ownership that the method of studying law is most reliably the sociological method. Extending it, in today's modern society where the law is everywhere socialized, it is impossible to abandon the sociological research method when studying any law.

Spring and Autumn

### The Troubles of Middle School Teachers

— (Zhou Yong)

Everyone says that education is a noble undertaking. Indeed, those clerk-like teachers deserve the two words "noble," which means "noble" in poverty and "high" in emptiness. As for some boss-like principals, with money around them, they cannot be said to be "noble."

Recently, prices on the isolated island have repeatedly risen, and the cost of living is almost twice as high as before the war; but how much can the work of the salaried class increase? Especially those who are teachers, not only have not increased their prices, but also have to depreciate. Taking middle school teachers as an example, in the past, in public middle schools, the salary per hour of teaching was 1.25 yuan, 1.75 yuan, and now it is very difficult to get 8 jiao, 1 yuan; some also changed the original six-month salary system to a five-month salary system, leaving teachers with two months of income empty each year. As for private middle schools, a salary of 3 or 4 jiao per hour of teaching is commonplace. But you must know that being a teacher is not just selling energy to students in the classroom; and after class, you have to spend a lot of effort to prepare lessons, grade papers... Therefore, on today's isolated island, being a clerk-like teacher, even if you are busy all day long, you will inevitably have to pay a bit of your old capital for family life.

However, being able to get a salary is still better than others; some private middle schools only give teachers a few yuan of "travel allowance" each month; even if you save all of it, it is only enough for yourself to eat a hard meal. This kind of thing is naturally not common, but it does exist.

The depreciation of teachers' salaries is said to be because school expenses have increased, which seems to be reasonable. However, some schools have raised tuition fees, and most schools have increased the number of students. As for the schools that were originally public, most of them still receive subsidies; and the equipment is simple and does not require spending money. It can be seen that the income of many schools is higher than before the war; however, teachers' salaries have not only not increased, but have decreased instead. In severe cases, the number of students increases and the number of teachers is reduced in order to implement a contracting system; this strange thing also happens.

The above only talks about the material situation of teachers. As for the spiritual aspect, it is also troubling.

The education sector, like the political sector, often has factional disputes. If there are two factions in a school, then faction A will win over students, and faction B will win over teachers, which will inevitably lead to open and secret struggles. A teacher who sincerely runs education and can gain the belief of students will either be pulled around by them and waste a lot of unjust effort; or they will be suspected and distrusted by them and suffer all kinds of attacks and criticisms. In such an atmosphere, the style of teaching is swept away, and the style of learning is naturally impossible to rectify, let alone talk about the way of teachers?

Even in schools where there is no factional dispute, being a teacher is not necessarily pleasant; ingratiating oneself with the boss and perfunctorily dealing with colleagues is already troublesome enough, and middle school students are not as docile as elementary school students, so you have to please students. If a teacher wants to strictly enforce discipline and is unfortunately booed and driven away by some spoiled students, it is not only spiritually embarrassing, but also has the risk of losing their job. Because some school leaders are unwilling to offend customers and would rather let the clerks suffer injustice.

As for being a teacher and wanting the school authorities to spend a little money, add equipment; work a little harder, promote teaching; and make economic administration public, and have cooperation between teachers and students, etc.; that is not only a small voice, but also a faithful word is unpleasant to the ear, and you are suspected of having ulterior motives.

Especially now, the general schools do not express their attitude towards the departure and retention of teachers and staff until after the holidays; appointment letters are often issued only when the school is about to start. Therefore, teachers are always worried at the end of each semester: the occupation of the next semester seems to be hanging in the air; and even if they are rehired, the teaching is reduced, which has become a major problem in the lives of teachers.

Ah, noble teachers, in such circumstances, they will feel pain in their conscience and tremble in their spirit. To make the lives of teachers pleasant and the cause of education truly "noble," I request that the Chinese education authorities strictly implement the following principles:

(1) Adopt talentism: Break all prejudices and strictly prohibit all factional disputes.

(2) Hold a serious attitude: Ban schools with business properties; reform the facilities of various schools; implement strict teaching and discipline.

(3) Improve teachers' treatment: Increase teachers' salaries, to at least be able to maintain their family life; and extend the term of employment to stabilize their lives.

(4) Implement the spirit of education: The entire school, from the principal, director, teachers to students, and school workers, must be integrated and cooperate, eliminate barriers, and work together towards the educational goals of China.

### Summer Service for Refugee Children Movement

— Xin Meng

The Chinese YMCA, after the successful conclusion of the Health Education Movement Week, the Boys' Division launched a summer service for refugee children movement. The goal of this movement is to allow members of the Boys' Division to have the opportunity to serve during the summer vacation and to make them more aware of the meaning of service. And the main task is to start by serving refugee children, helping teachers in various shelters, and promoting the education of refugee children. The intention is not to be unkind.

As far as I know, among all the members of the Chinese YMCA in Shanghai, in addition to adults, there are also boys, so there is a distinction between the adult department and the boys' department; and children under the age of sixteen can join the YMCA as boy members. The membership fees are much lower than those for adults, but boy members can also enjoy the same sports, library, bathroom and other facilities. The day schools and night schools attached to the YMCA, all the students are boy members, and at the same time, many young people from the vocational sector also join as boy members and use their spare time to study. In addition to implementing group life and working hard to study, general boy members also often use opportunities to serve the community, organize drama troupes, lecture groups, and establish voluntary night schools, etc.

After the YMCA Boys' Division began the summer service for refugee children movement, it started with training, and the association carefully selected several outstanding members for special training. After about ten days of training, they were sent to the No. 12 shelter on Yuyuan Road to serve. In order to perfect the work, the first four weeks were a trial period, and whether it would continue in the future would depend on the service performance. The service time is from 2 pm to 5 pm every day. The little teacher system is adopted. In terms of teaching materials, they are divided into (1) singing, (2) group games, (3) celebrity stories, (4) civic education, etc. In this way, members can get practical opportunities, and refugee children can get increased knowledge, which is really beneficial to both!

However, there are currently many refugee children in Shanghai, not only in shelters, but also wandering in the streets and alleys, the numbers may not necessarily be less than those in shelters. General refugee children are in a state of being out of school, and they are urgently in need of people to provide volunteer education, so that they will not become illiterate, and in the future, whether in their own lives or in their contribution to the society, they can increase their effectiveness by knowing some characters. It can be seen how important this work is. On the other hand, many literate youths with secondary education or above, instead of wasting two months of vacation time, it is better to serve refugee children. Therefore, I think the summer refugee children service movement should be promoted to the bodies of youths in every corner, and promoted to all refugee children in all shelters and street wandering refugee children in Shanghai, so that there will be a definite effect. Furthermore, it is not limited to the summer vacation, but after the summer vacation, this service for refugee children movement should continue to be promoted.

### The Iron Man's Last Road

— Bai Hua

“Ex-Champ”

After watching "Maritime Purgatory", I feel that a mediocre director is a great loss to the actors. In "The Iron Man's Last Road", Victor McLaglen was also buried. For example, in the drinking scene of McLaglen, he borrowed wine to relieve his sorrows under a very painful mood, but after the director added a gimmick, the audience laughed loudly, and intuitively felt that McLaglen seemed to be a clown in this scene.

The whole play is also piled up with some small gimmicks. The discord between father and son, and McLaglen's training of Bob, are not properly connected, so that the whole play only sees many trivial scenes. Even the final boxing match could not capture the tense air in the boxing ring.

Only after McLaglen secretly put the sleeping pill in the water, he walked out of the boxing ring blankly, and only when he got to the boxing room did he look at the medicine on his palm, and then sat down in fear. Here, the director handled the shouts in the boxing ring and the low music to accompany McLaglen's contradictory mood very well, but after Massey came in, the director used McLaglen's fainting to win the laughter of the audience.

A boxer who will win the boxing championship, because he is too old to dominate the boxing ring, is reduced to a gatekeeper. The son is in love with a rich woman and despises his father, but when the son spends money wastefully and misuses public funds, he is still deep in love with his son and wants to use illegal means to earn a huge sum of money. The director wrote such a story into a comedy, and naturally could not save its fate.

The second thing is the purchase of machines. Trading machines and building houses can be carried out at the same time, so as not to waste time. However, some of the machines can already be manufactured in China, while others cannot. The two Misses He studied the spinning green industry in the United States, and they also knew a little bit about textile machinery. In general, those who study abroad in a certain country believe in everything in that country. They studied in the United States, so they naturally believed in everything in the United States. Therefore, in their minds, if they trade machines, they must buy American machines. This is actually very reasonable. They learned in the United States and have some experience in the American textile industry. If they change to the machinery of another country, they will be at a loss. However, the material civilization of the world is progressing very quickly now, and it is often changing there. As the saying goes, "With a blink of an eye, the old hen becomes a duck." Although they have only returned to China for two or three years, the situation abroad has changed again. They feel that they have to go to the United States to order machines, and to order machines, they have to go to the United States themselves. They have already discussed it the day before yesterday. They said: "I don't want to be a manager, but I want to be an engineer." They have also discussed going to the United States. It is not only for the machine, they are preparing to do foreign trade for this silk weaving factory, to sell the finished fabrics abroad, so they must go to inspect in advance. There is no need for two people to go to inspect, only one person is enough. Or two people can take turns to go out, Liyu this year, Shuangyu next year, it is also possible. Because they are two people, Liyu is active, Shuangyu is quiet, of course Liyu is willing to go out first. Shuangyu also knows her wish, so if one of the two people goes out, she is also willing to let Liyu go out first. The night before last, they had already discussed this matter. Liyu said: "We will ask our father about this matter. If our father agrees that one of us two people will go out, please ask our father to appoint. Whoever our father appoints will go out." Shuangyu said: "I think there is no need to ask our father to appoint. When we go back, our father will say: You have already discussed and settled it yourself, why do you need me to appoint? If you decide to go out, it is reasonable for you to go out first, you should go out first." Liyu said: "What is the reason?" Shuangyu said: "You have the knowledge of yourself, you are more active than me, and you are better than me in everything in communication. There will be some banquets and other things when you go out for the first time, it is still more appropriate for you. What's more, you have studied painting, and weaving has a very close relationship with painting, etc., this is also more suitable for you." (165)
