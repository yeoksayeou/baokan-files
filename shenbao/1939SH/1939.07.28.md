### Important Diplomatic Move by the United States: US-Japan Commercial Treaty Declared Void - Sanctions Loom, Japan Shocked, Stocks Plummet - China Believes It is the Greatest Moral Support

(Washington) The United States government has decided to declare the annulment of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. This startling news was released yesterday around 10 PM, when the head of the State Department's information office summoned reporters from various newspapers, providing them with a statement. It stated that the US government, in order to more comprehensively protect the interests it maintains in the Far East and to foster their development, has decided to declare the annulment of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. According to the provisions of this treaty, the US government's decision will take effect six months after notification, i.e., January 26, 1940. Consequently, the proposal by Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to prohibit the shipment of munitions and raw materials to Japan, can be submitted for discussion once Congress reconvenes in January next year, as the treaty's provisions stipulate that neither side may discriminate against the other, which would conflict with Pittman's proposal. (Havas, 27th)

(Tokyo) Regarding the US government's notification of the abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, Ambassador Horinouchi's telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs arrived at 3 PM on the 27th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will carefully study the true intentions of the US government based on this report and then seek appropriate and effective measures at a suitable time. (Domei, 27th)

(Tokyo) Based on instructions from his government, the US Chargé d'Affaires to Japan, Dooman, visited Yoshizawa, the director of the American Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at noon today, formally notifying him of the US decision to abrogate the current US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, and explaining the reasons. It was stated that due to the recent surge in American imports of Japanese cotton yarn products, the US, after considering various defensive measures, accepted the demands of the private sector and took this action. Director Yoshizawa, while acknowledging the notification, stated that the sudden move by the US had to be considered an act of challenge towards Japan. He also stated that even if the US proposed the conclusion of a new treaty in the future, satisfactory results would not be obtained if such an attitude was not abandoned, urging the US to reconsider. (Domei, 27th)

(Tokyo) The first reaction here upon hearing the US announcement of the abrogation of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation was shock. Japan initially believed that the bill proposed by Republican Senator Vandenberg in the Senate on July 18th was purely a domestic political maneuver and would not be implemented. Japan had long thought that America was exercising patience, thus misunderstanding its attitude towards Japan. Now, the sudden move by the US government has shattered the long-propagated misunderstanding of America's attitude. After receiving this news, the Japanese stock market plummeted, with some stocks falling by two yen. (Reuters, 27th)

(Chongqing) Today, there is great joy here regarding the US decision to abrogate the trade treaty with Japan. Although this decision will take effect in six months, the general consensus is that it is perhaps the greatest moral encouragement that any power could give to China. Prior to the announcement of this matter, Chongqing had received intelligence that the US would make some kind of move to break away from Britain's appeasement policy in the Far East. Observers believe that this action by the US is a very clever move psychologically, which will make a most profound impression on the Chinese regarding American friendship. (Reuters, 27th)

### Full Text of the Note

(Washington) Regarding the declaration of the abrogation of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, Secretary of State Hull delivered a note to Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi yesterday, stating: "For several years, the United States government has studied the treaties of commerce and navigation signed between our country and various nations, thereby seeking to revise them so that the original objectives of these treaties may be more easily achieved. Soon a conclusion was reached that certain clauses in the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation established between the United States and Japan in Washington on February 21, 1911, need to be reconsidered. Now, for the necessity of preparing in advance and adapting to the progress of the situation, so that American interests may be more comprehensively protected and developed, in accordance with Article 17 of this treaty, we hereby notify your government of the intention to declare its abrogation. From now on, this treaty and the attached protocol shall expire six months after July 26 of this year." (Havas, 27th)

### New Sino-British Loan Still Under Negotiation - Premature to Speak of Signing

(London) It is rumored in Chinese circles that Britain has granted China a new export credit loan of £3 million, which was signed last week. This report is denied here today, with sources stating that these negotiations have been ongoing for months, but have not yet been concluded, and there is no signing. (Reuters, 27th)

### Commemorative Stamps Presented to US President

(Chongqing) Minister of Communications Zhang Jia'ao presented 30 sets of Chinese stamps to the American Embassy here to be forwarded to President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and Postmaster General Farley. These stamps are commemorative stamps issued by the Chinese government to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the establishment of the US government. The stamps come in four denominations: 3 fen, 5 fen, 2 jiao 5 fen, 5 jiao, and 1 yuan. The center features a map of China adorned with miniature American flags. Ten million sets of these stamps have been issued and are being sold throughout China. (Reuters, 27th)

### Most Startling Development Since the Sino-Japanese War Began: Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty May Also Be Abrogated

(London) According to reliable sources today, in order to take consistent action with the United States in the Far East, Britain intends to terminate the 1911 Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty today. It is said that when the British government abrogates this treaty, it will give Japan a one-year grace period. (Associated Press, 27th)

(London) The US notification to Japan to cancel the US-Japan Commercial Treaty is arguably the most startling event related to the Sino-Japanese War, as it follows closely after President Roosevelt's defeat in the Senate regarding the Neutrality Act revision, signaling a resurgence of the American isolationist faction. Although the newspapers have not yet published articles criticizing it, the evening papers have prominently featured this news. Political circles are currently refusing to comment, stating that they have not yet received official notification of the treaty's cancellation and that its effects should be carefully considered. Reuters has gathered opinions from Chinese, British, and Japanese sources as follows: The Chinese are overjoyed, saying that they expected the US to take action sooner or later from the beginning of the war, and now it has come true. The British believe that the US action will have a beneficial impact on the Tokyo talks. Japanese businessmen are concerned that the notification of cancellation has almost the same effect as the actual cancellation because American businesses will hesitate to enter into contracts with Japanese businesses, as they do not know what their position will be in January next year. Some observers now fear that extremists in the Japanese military may use this opportunity to force Japan to conclude a military alliance with Germany and Italy. Others are more optimistic, saying that Japan relies on the US for supplies of scrap iron and gasoline, both of which are necessary for warfare, so they believe that the abrogation of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty may well open the door to eventual peace. (Reuters, 27th)

(London) Members of Parliament here are delighted to hear that the US government has declared the abrogation of the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, saying: "The poor impression created by the US government's refusal to cooperate with Britain and France in financially assisting China to stabilize its currency has now been completely dispelled. Moreover, the US move has special significance, as the existing Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty was also established in 1911. The British government may follow in the footsteps of the United States when necessary and declare its abrogation." Regarding this matter, the government has not yet considered it, but political figures insist that the British authorities will not allow the Tokyo talks to extend beyond the scope of the Tianjin local incident. In addition, the main source of Japanese military supplies is about to be cut off (referring to the Pittman proposal, which the US Congress will discuss in January next year), which should easily pressure Japan to comply. (Havas, 27th)

### British Compromise with Japan: MPs Raise Questions One After Another, Undersecretary of State Declares No More Munitions Shipped to Japan

(London) During the House of Commons session this afternoon, several MPs raised questions about financial assistance to China. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler reiterated in his reply that Britain's policy towards China had not changed. Labour MP Maclean asked whether the Japanese war aims in China were recognized by the British government and whether future Anglo-Japanese talks would be based on the principle of China's vast territory falling into the hands of the Japanese army and being governed by Japan. Butler replied: "No." Maclean further asked: "Since the land involved in the Anglo-Japanese talks does not belong to Britain or Japan, what is the reason for conducting the talks?" Butler replied: "Certain facts, even if extremely displeasing to the British government, must sometimes be taken into consideration." Labour MP Henderson asked whether, after the conclusion of the initial Anglo-Japanese agreement, Britain would no longer legally recognize the Chinese government and continue to provide it with financial assistance. Butler replied that the Anglo-Japanese agreement did not mean a change in Britain's general policy towards China, as Prime Minister Chamberlain had already stated. Henderson also said that a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry had made a statement saying that Britain would no longer provide financial assistance to China, and the government should pay attention to this. Butler then reiterated his assurance that Britain's policy towards China had not changed. Labour MP Alexander asked whether representations had been made to the Japanese government regarding the Japanese blockade policy, which had now extended to Shameen. Undersecretary of State Butler replied: "The entire matter is under consideration." Labour MP Maclean also raised a question about the four Chinese suspects in the Tianjin Cheng Xigeng case, saying, "Does the right to try these suspects belong to the Chinese courts, rather than being taken over by the British and Japanese?" Butler did not answer this point, merely stating that the suspects would not be extradited until the Japanese side presented new evidence. Labour MP Price asked whether any countries had taken the necessary measures to prevent the sale of armaments to Japan. Butler replied that, apart from the US government's advice to aircraft manufacturers not to sell aircraft to Japan, no other countries had made any public statements. As far as Britain is concerned, the government has not issued any export licenses for munitions to Japan since February 4, 1938. As for Germany, it is selling large quantities of munitions to China. (Havas, 26th)

### Japanese Newspaper's Attempt at Self-Justification

(Tokyo) Japanese evening newspapers believe that the US declaration of the abrogation of the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty has damaged the goodwill between the two countries. Japanese political figures say that the US government wants to abrogate the treaty in order to prepare to prohibit US merchants from selling and transporting military goods to Japan, while Japanese economic figures believe that the US abrogation implies an economic challenge to Japan. They speculate that the US government consulted with the British government before taking this step, with the motive of strengthening the position of the British in the Tokyo talks and giving Japan a psychological blow. (Haitong, 27th)

(Tokyo) The "China and Foreign Commercial News" cited trade statistics from last year as proof, saying that Japan purchased oil, iron, copper, and raw cotton from the US, worth 915,353,000 yen, while Japanese goods sold to the US, such as raw silk, canned food, cotton cloth, and porcelain, were only worth 425,123,000 yen. The newspaper also said that because silk is indispensable to the lives of Americans, there are 200,000 Americans working in the silk industry. It believes that the US government cannot force a large reduction in Japanese silk imports. After the treaty is abrogated, a major ban on the export of military goods to Japan will follow. (Reuters, 27th)

### Fourth Anglo-Japanese Conference

(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department announced that the fourth Anglo-Japanese conference was held twice at the residence of the Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, from 9:45 AM to 1:00 PM and from 4:00 PM to 6:30 PM on July 27. In the morning, the details of police procedures that could be implemented in the future were discussed and brought to a conclusion. In the afternoon, economic issues were deliberated. It was decided that the next conference would be held at 10:00 AM on the 28th. (Domei, 27th)

Editorial

### The United States Abrogates the US-Japan Commercial Treaty

Gloomy clouds are all around, the wind and rain are mournful, it seems as if the sky is about to fall, as if the land is about to sink, ghostly shadows flit about, it seems as if mankind is about to be destroyed. It is at this moment that a thunderclap brings sudden enlightenment! How can one not believe that the influence of the US government's sudden announcement the other night to abrogate the US-Japan Commercial Treaty extends to the entire international phenomenon, both past and future!

The existing US-Japan Commercial Treaty was signed in 1911 and has been in effect for 28 years. It is based on friendship, equality, and mutual benefit, and its scope covers commerce and navigation. The announcement of its abrogation was made in Washington on the evening of July 26, which is the morning of the 27th in Shanghai. The procedure for abrogation was a formal notification from the US government to the Japanese government. The reason for the abrogation is "to better protect American interests." The implementation of the abrogation will take effect six months from the date of the announcement, i.e., beginning on January 26, 1940.

Taking the abrogation of the commercial treaty itself, focusing on the commerce and navigation of the US and Japan, and the agricultural and industrial sectors that are closely related to them as a whole, as well as national finance, the national economy, and even the daily lives of the general public, the implications of the existence or abrogation of the treaty cannot be exaggerated in magnitude, and the aspects that can be discussed cannot be overstated in number. Let us not say that even discussing this is not the most urgent matter at present, nor can it be fully explained in a short newspaper commentary. Moreover, this action by this country on this day has significance and implications that extend far beyond the scope of a commercial treaty. Please allow a general account.

Before the US government announced the abrogation of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty the other night, there were many in the US government and public who discussed it for a year, but they had no direct relationship to the current measures. This is evidenced by the fact that a month ago, the US authorities, regarding the application of the established law of imposing special taxes on German goods to Japan, were still acting cautiously and hesitating to act. A week ago, some US Congressmen suggested abrogating the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, but it also had no direct relationship to the current measures. The bill had not yet been reviewed, had not yet been put on the agenda, let alone voted on and passed into law. This is further evidenced by the fact that Secretary of State Hull's response to inquiries a few days ago still stated that this session was unlikely to discuss this matter and that it would have to wait until next year. It can thus be seen that this decision to announce the abrogation of the treaty was indeed made decisively in response to the most pressing current situation and was by no means a pre-planned strategy from days or months ago. Yesterday, Reuters' Washington dispatch called it a sudden occurrence, unexpected, like the explosion of a bomb; such is the case for good reason. However, this only refers to the action; in terms of the overall situation, American interests have been greatly eroded and discriminated against, and the spirit and foundation of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty had long been abandoned by the Japanese side; thus, the current abrogation can be said to be a natural measure. Moreover, since the outbreak of the Far East incident, the US government, for several years, whether issuing declarations, diplomatic notes, or protests, has invariably emphasized its determination to protect American interests; listeners may have been few, but speakers have been earnest. Thus, the current abrogation can be said to be a measure that has been repeatedly forewarned. The action is sudden, but the nature is not sudden.

The impact of this move by the United States on the entire international phenomenon and the future trends of the international situation will certainly have objective and concrete facts, which will gradually be recognized by the world and future generations in the near future. This is by no means our extravagant hope, nor does it require today's predictions. For there are things that are inevitable, and there are forces that cannot be resisted. However, to predict a certain dispute or a certain problem for the sake of pleasure is merely to stimulate emotions that are harmful and useless, and it can well be stopped. What can be discussed in general is that the US, in its recent congressional discussions of the Neutrality Act, has shown the weaknesses of party politics and the predicament of President Roosevelt in political struggles. However, this sudden declaration of the abrogation of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty is clear proof of the absolute consensus of both parties on foreign policy. Senator Vandenberg and others, Republican senators in the US opposition, have already declared that they will not use foreign policy as a tool of political struggle, and the so-called isolationists, politically speaking, do not entirely take party affiliation as a boundary, and ideologically, they firmly advocate isolation on European issues, while they mostly advocate active involvement in the Far East and Latin America. Therefore, this decisive measure is by no means a unilateral decision by the authorities but is supported by the full strength of the entire United States. This is the first thing that should be recognized. For several years, from the Far East to Africa to Europe, the actions of aggressor nations have been almost universally successful, and the arrogance of aggressor nations has been almost impossible to blunt. Thus, their desires have become more extravagant, and their momentum has increased. What they fear is the United States, and what they are flattering is the United States, thinking that if they treat it with respect and keep it at a distance, it will no longer stand in their way. Indeed, the national power and position of the United States are truly pivotal in the international arena and cannot be compared with by any aggressor nation or even aggressor group. And this decisive measure, which is said to be a declaration of the abrogation of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, is rather a declaration of determination to stop aggression in the Far East. Seeing this, "the greedy will become honest!" This is administering the right medicine for the illness, the second point. Countries that have fallen to aggressors have done nothing but gain the world's sympathy. Yet there is a country that braves all difficulties and endures great pain to resist violence, to defend independence and freedom through war, to sacrifice for justice, and to be in the forefront of the common interests of friendly nations. This is what maintains the world's faltering faith in justice and has unparalleled value. However, what two years of resistance have contributed to the world is that Britain's one knee in Tokyo has almost made the world suspect that justice has fallen to the ground beyond recovery. And now, the US measures have not only given the resistance fighters deeper confidence and revived the general public's sense of justice, but also, at this urgent moment, can "make the cowards stand!" This is turning the tide, the third point.

Alas! Mankind should indeed be civilized animals who take freedom and equality as the principles of life. In recent years, those who can oppose freedom and advocate shackles, and those who can oppose equality and advocate conquest, are practicing their anti-civilization ways. As the wind blows, the grass bends. The cowardly have followed suit, bowing their heads and lowering their hearts, either being shackled, conquered, or shamelessly seeking their own well-being, siding with shackles and conquest, and sitting idly by as freedom and equality decline and fall. Today, the United States has raised its voice from a high place, deafening the deaf and opening the eyes of the blind, proving that mankind can still be civilized animals. International relations should be based on mutual respect for sovereignty and mutual respect for independence. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to destroy everything by violence and to dominate everything by violence. At the extreme, there is only violence as a trackless track. And today's actions by the United States are both the beginning of clearing up the international situation and restoring order, and the basic work of laying the foundation for order. This is a historical measure of civilization and a historical measure of international relations. When things reach an extreme, they will surely reverse; the time is not far off. But will the violent take advantage of the period between about to reverse and not yet reversed, to act out their most violent acts and attempt a final struggle? This is what those who are determined to promote human civilization and restore international order should be fully vigilant about and jointly address.

### Roosevelt Decides to Abrogate Treaty: Nearly Unprecedented in American History; Upholding Rights and Opposing Aggression: A Prelude to the Embargo of Munitions

(Washington) President Roosevelt yesterday first summoned the Far Eastern Affairs Advisor, then received Secretary of State Hull, and agreed to abrogate the treaty. The note of abrogation was then delivered to the Japanese Ambassador. (Reuter, 27th)

(Washington) The abrogation of the U.S.-Japan treaty was unexpected by those concerned. Yesterday at 11:30 AM, Secretary of State Hull summoned reporters to the State Department and announced the news of the abrogation. The United States is the largest supplier of military goods needed by Japan, including cotton, steel, iron, and gasoline, all necessities for warfare. The United States is a particularly large supplier. Those who support the arms embargo generally believe that the implementation of an embargo against Japan can prevent Japan's aggression against China or force Japan to withdraw its aggression. Opponents say that this action leads to war, believing that Japan will retaliate. From then on, the two countries will retaliate against each other endlessly, eventually leading to war. (Reuter, 27th)

(Washington) The U.S. government's announcement of the abrogation of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation is regarded by diplomatic circles as a warning to Japan. Regarding this matter, Senator Vandenberg, a Republican, previously submitted a proposal to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. After the committee decided to postpone further discussion until next week, there was a misunderstanding as to what the U.S. attitude would be. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull therefore decided to announce the abrogation. Secretary of State Hull has notified Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi and instructed the U.S. Embassy in Japan to notify Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. Political figures here stated in firm tones that the U.S. government only needs to announce the abrogation of the Most Favored Nation clause, and the proposal made by Biderman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (that is, a proposal to authorize the President to prohibit the shipment of arms, ammunition, kerosene, and various metals and metal mixtures to countries that destroy the Nine-Power Treaty), can be submitted to the Senate for a vote and passed without difficulty. Now, the U.S. government has decided to abrogate the entire U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, which is due to political reasons. The U.S. government's abrogation of a commercial treaty for purely political reasons, except during the French Revolution when French pirates attacked American merchant ships, resulting in the abrogation of the U.S.-France commercial treaty, is almost without precedent. Judging from this, the U.S. policy toward China will still maintain the principle of "Open Door," and clearly indicate that when necessary, it will retaliate against countries that violate this principle, regardless of the policies of other countries toward China. As for the various incidents that have recently occurred in China, such as the beating of Baker, the clerk of the U.S. gunboat Guam, by Japanese soldiers in Hankou last week, the Japanese blockade of Guangzhou, or any harm to American residents, the U.S. government cannot condone them. Now, before implementing a "sanctions policy," that is, before prohibiting the shipment of arms and ammunition to Japan, the U.S. is giving the Japanese government six months to change its policy in China. Regarding this matter, American public opinion generally believes that actions within China are becoming increasingly apparent. Although the reasons why Britain must compromise with Japan after the establishment of a preliminary agreement between Britain and Japan in Tokyo can be understood, the sentiment of hoping that the United States will take positive action is becoming stronger. The State Department therefore decided to announce the abrogation in order to satisfy general public opinion. Political figures here also said that Secretary of State Hull issued a statement on the 19th of last month, restating the policy toward China (briefly stating that although the Tianjin incident has nothing to do with the United States, its development and significance are of great concern to the U.S. government, judging from what has been seen and heard in other parts of China in the past and now). In view of the various incidents that have occurred again in China, this policy must be promoted in a warning manner." (Havas, 27th)

(Washington) The U.S. government's announcement of the abrogation of the 1911 U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has been endorsed by Senator Biderman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senator Vandenberg, the Republican who proposed the abrogation of the treaty. Vandenberg said, "This action by the government is commendable. Considering the interests preserved by the United States in the Far East, the situation this year is significantly different from when this treaty was signed in 1911. A new treaty must be drafted to adapt to reality. Our country has now given Japan six months to see if that country is willing to continue to maintain friendly relations with our country. Our country is no longer bound by this outdated treaty and can negotiate a new treaty with Japan to protect our rights." Biderman said, "This is a meaningful and well-founded action." (Havas, 27th)

### China Purchases Machinery for Manufacturing U.S. Transport Vehicles

Buffalo, USA. The Stewart-Maddi Transport Vehicle Manufacturing Company was liquidated automatically in February of this year. The machinery in the factory has now been purchased by the Chinese. It is widely believed that the machinery will be shipped to China. (Reuter, 26th)

### US Determined to Preserve Face in Far East

(Washington) The New York Times stated in its news column that this action by the U.S. authorities shows that the U.S. is not only safeguarding its rights in the Far East but is also prepared to take retaliatory action if Japan infringes on its rights. If Japan repeatedly uses actions such as Japanese soldiers beating Americans in China to deliberately make the U.S. lose face in the Far East, then Orientals should know that the U.S. is doing its best to maintain its dignity and is dealing with Japan in the only language that a government ruled by warlords can understand. This action by the U.S. has shown Japan and the world that although Britain may have made some concessions in the Tianjin issue, the U.S. will not do so. The newspaper's Washington dispatch stated that President Roosevelt decided to take this action when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee postponed the discussion of the treaty abrogation proposal. (Reuter, 27th)

### Soviet and Japanese Troops Confront Each Other on Both Banks of the Khalkha River

Bairshagal, 26th. Last night, Japanese artillery units heavily shelled the Soviet artillery positions on the opposite bank of the Khalkha River. It is also reported that as of the 27th, Japanese-Manchu troops and Soviet troops are confronting each other across the river in the Khalkha River battle. (Domei, 27th)

(Changchun) The Kwantung Army Headquarters announced that the Soviet troops who crossed the border in the Nomonhan area on July 23 are currently engaged in combat after the Japanese counterattack and are shelling Soviet artillery positions on the opposite bank of the Khalkha River. Japanese troops defending the Khalkha River are closely monitoring the Soviet troops. (Domei, 27th)

(Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Naval Ministry stated at a press conference today that the Japanese Navy has decided and is prepared to protect Japan's legitimate rights in Sakhalin Island. The Soviet government apparently wants to confiscate coal mines and oil fields owned by the Japanese. These industries were recognized by the Soviet government as compensation for the massacre of 700 Japanese residents in Nikolaevsk-on-Amur in 1920. The Japanese Navy is currently closely monitoring the development of the diplomatic negotiations underway in Moscow. (Reuter, 27th)

(Hong Kong) Japanese troops, using a portion of their naval, land, and air forces, launched an invasion of the Fourth District of Zhongshan. On the 24th, they occupied the isolated Qiqingshan Island opposite Hengmen and set up artillery positions. Yesterday, they sent shallow-water warships, transport ships, etc., carrying 500-600 soldiers to attack the Furongshan Wangrongwei area near Hengmen and attempted to land troops. Zhang Huichang personally led his team to resist. The artillery battle continued throughout the night. Dieshi and Jinzhong and other places are still peaceful. (Special Dispatch, 27th)

Zhaoqing. The battle situation in Xinhui and Jiangmen is quiet. Japanese and Chinese troops are still confronting each other in their original positions. (Telegram, 26th)

Zhaoqing. The Japanese attempted to disturb Hengmen in Zhongshan on the morning of the 24th but failed. They came again on the 25th. From morning to dusk, Japanese warships outside Hengmen continued to bombard Furong, Qiongzhou, and other places in Hengmen. At the same time, several Japanese planes bombed the Hengmen area in batches and strafed intensively with machine guns, attempting to cover the Japanese troops' forced landing. The Chinese defense forces and self-defense teams calmly resisted and fought hard all day. The Japanese offensive was thwarted at night, and they retreated one after another. (Telegram, 27th)

Zhaoqing. At dawn on the 24th, three Japanese transport ships, five shallow-water warships, seven armored fishing boats, and more than ten motorboats gathered on the Hengmen River in Zhongshan. At 10:00 AM, a part of the Japanese fleet, carrying hundreds of Japanese soldiers, invaded along the river under the cover of two Japanese planes, breaking through the Chinese Hengmen blockade line. The Chinese garrison calmly counterattacked, inflicting heavy damage on them. The Japanese army failed and withdrew from Hengmen and landed on the isolated Qiqing Island. The Chinese army is closely monitoring them. (Telegram, 26th)

### Japanese Troops Shaken in Central Hubei; Chinese Troops Advance on Suixian; Japanese Troops in Zhongxiang Hold Fast; Transportation Between Yuekou and Qianjiang Cut Off

Fancheng. The Japanese troops in central Hubei are extremely panicked due to the Chinese army's continuous attacks. Anlu, which is more than 400 li away from the former front line in central Hubei and which the Japanese army has used as a military base in central Hubei, has also been shaken. Currently, there are 40-50 Japanese military vehicles carrying Japanese corpses and important military supplies away from Anlu. Lugudun, a stronghold near Suixian, was recaptured by the Chinese army on the morning of the 25th, killing more than 70 Japanese soldiers and seizing two Japanese cannons. The first to attack Lugudun was a brave team from a certain Chinese unit. When the team entered the Japanese阵地, they threw more than 100 hand grenades and fought fiercely with the Japanese army. When the follow-up Chinese troops arrived, the Chinese brave team had all sacrificed themselves for the country, and the Japanese army also retreated due to heavy casualties. The Chinese vanguard attacked Suixian on the 26th, and the Japanese troops fled in all directions. Chinese troops are still夹击in the Zhongxiang area, and the Japanese troops are holding fast. Transportation between Yuekou and Qianjiang has been cut off. The Japanese troops along the East Jing River have slightly increased and are operating towards the west of the city. The Chinese army has destroyed the Japanese army's transportation routes to cut off the Japanese army's supplies. (Telegram, 27th)

Yichang. A certain Chinese unit crossing the Hanshui River encountered several hundred Japanese soldiers near Qianjiang on the 24th. After a long and fierce battle, the Japanese army was finally repelled by the Chinese army, suffering more than 100 casualties and abandoning many military supplies. The Chinese army is continuing to advance towards Qianjiang. (Telegram, 26th)

### Intense Fighting in Southern Shanxi; Part of Chinese Army Rushes into Qinghua Town; Dongcun Station Also Recaptured

(Xi'an) Military news: on the 25th, in heavy rain, a certain Chinese unit lay in ambush in Fenghouyu (southeast of Yuxiang) and Chaijiayao (southwest of Jiexian) and besieged Qinghua Town with all their strength. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted in the fortress, and the battle was fierce. Then, more than 100 Japanese soldiers from Yuxiang reinforced Qinghua Town, but they were ambushed by the Chinese army, and the Japanese soldiers were almost completely wiped out. Then, more than 200 infantry and several cannons came from Yuxiang and attacked Fenghouyu, engaging in street fighting with the Japanese army all night. At the same time, another main force of the Chinese army attacked Dongcun Station, fought fiercely with the Japanese army for three hours, and recaptured the station. Then, more than 200 Japanese soldiers and four cannons from Jiexian reinforced Dongcun Station and were ambushed by Chinese ambush troops in Chaijiayao.

### Even If Britain Cancels Aid, the Chinese Can Still Fight: Weng Wenhao's Statement; If Britain Wants to Protect Its Interests in the Far East, It Must Take a Tough Stance

(Chongqing) According to Economic Minister Weng Wenhao, speaking to the Associated Press reporter today, even if Britain completely cancels its aid to China, we can fight at any time. Our soldiers are also loyal, brave, and persevering. We must think about future generations. Although we need foreign loans, we have no other hope other than loans. This is also the general opinion of the Chinese here. Also, according to the English-language Chu Bao today, if Britain accepts the Japanese demands, it can at most temporarily protect its interests in the Far East. However, if the British can take a tough stance, Japan, because of the danger of war, will be able to adapt and withdraw its demands. Japan is now trying to use bluffing and intimidation to obtain from Britain everything it cannot achieve in China through war. Therefore, the only way to deal with Japan is to expose its bluffing. Because of Britain's firm stance in Europe, Danzig has been preserved. Therefore, if Britain can take the same stance in the Far East, it will be able to protect all its interests in the Far East. The newspaper then compared the military strength of Britain and Japan, believing that although Japan can seize British concessions and Hong Kong in China at the beginning of the war, Britain has control of the sea and economic power, which can lead to Japan's collapse. Moreover, Britain's subjugation of Japan in the Far East will not weaken its position in Europe. However, the worst strategy is to try to satisfy the insatiable desires of the aggressor. Some Chinese people believe that Britain's attitude towards China was extremely cold in the first year of the war. It was not until after the United States provided economic aid to China that Britain also made some gestures. If Britain abandons China in the future, the Chinese will never forget it. (Associated Press, 27th)

(Chongqing) The United Daily News here, after criticizing Britain's attitude at the Tokyo conference yesterday, today used a more moderate tone to comment on the matter, saying that Britain's attempt to compromise with Japan is enough to encourage the seizure of the rights and interests of third countries in China. In order to protect its own interests and fulfill its obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty and the resolutions passed by the League of Nations, Britain should not change its policy in China. British Prime Minister Chamberlain has already made a full statement in his speech in the House of Commons. After explaining that the Tokyo compromise plan is clearly inconsistent with the British Prime Minister's speech, the newspaper expressed that Britain's approval of the Tokyo plan is only an attempt to avoid immediate conflict with Japan at a time when the Anglo-French-Soviet pact has not yet been completed and the U.S. Neutrality Act has not yet been revised. At the same time, there is no sign of easing in the European situation. The newspaper continued that Britain's future actions are worthy of our attention. It must be known that appeasement policy can never satisfy the ambition of the aggressor, but only makes the relationship between Britain and other countries increasingly alienated. Finally, the newspaper asked the Chinese people to adopt a calm and patient attitude towards the Tokyo conference in order to avoid the conspiracy of the Japanese to undermine Sino-British friendship. (Reuter, 27th)

(Hong Kong) The Governor of Hong Kong declared in the Legislative Council today, "I believe that the preliminary agreement signed in Tokyo does not foreshadow that Britain's policy towards China will be weaker than before. I solemnly declare that the outside world's misunderstanding is due to the intentional slander and dissemination of rumors by China's enemies and those who are ill-intentioned towards Britain, without solid evidence. However, the attitude clearly expressed by Prime Minister Chamberlain in the British House of Commons can be realized." (Haitong Telegram, 27th)

### China Islamic National Salvation Association Holds Annual Meeting in Chongqing; President Chiang's Speech: Praising Muslims for Defending the Truth; Many Examples of Loyalty and Bravery in History

(Chongqing) President Chiang delivered a speech yesterday at the annual meeting of the China Islamic National Salvation Association here, stating that the 50 million Muslims in China have made valuable contributions in terms of manpower, financial resources, and other forms in China's united resistance against Japanese aggression. More than 200 Islamic leaders attended the meeting, as well as many high-ranking Chinese officials, such as Deputy Chief of Staff Bai Chongxi, who is the chairman of the association, Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, and Minister of Education Chen Lifu. President Chiang praised the Muslims' love of justice and fearless spirit of defending the truth and cited many historical examples of the loyalty and bravery of Chinese Muslims, such as Chang Yuchun of the Ming Dynasty. President Chiang also stressed the freedom of religious belief in China, saying that Buddhism, Taoism, Christianity, and Islam coexist in China. There was a moving ceremony at the opening of the conference, in which the Chinese Islamic imam recited prayers from the Quran and prayed for the final victory of China. (Reuter, 27th)

### Sudden Turn in the Three-Power Talks; Agreement Expected Within Days; Definition of "Indirect Aggression" Largely Agreed Upon; Tripartite General Staff to Hold Talks; Soviet Foreign Minister Continues Talks with British and French Ambassadors Yesterday

(Paris) Regarding the ongoing negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, government sources have reportedly stated that Britain and France have jointly drafted new instructions with identical content. These will be telegraphed to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, and the French Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Naggiar, tonight. The ambassadors are expected to meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov tomorrow evening to discuss the final obstacles to the political agreement, namely the definition of "indirect aggression" and the issue of tripartite general staff talks. France will be represented in these talks by General Huntziger, commander of troops in the Near East (Note: General Huntziger is a member of the Supreme Military Council and once represented France in talks with Turkish General Staff personnel), assisted by General Dumont of Lille, although this is not yet confirmed. (Havas, 26th)

(London) Reuters diplomatic correspondent has learned that the meeting between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and British Ambassador Seeds and French Ambassador Naggiar is scheduled to continue today, with the aim of finalizing the agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 27th)

(London) The Financial Times recently reported, "According to news received here last night, the agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union may be signed today. Representatives of the general staffs of the respective countries will then quickly hold talks. Britain and the Soviet Union will also conduct trade negotiations, and Britain may request the Soviet government to send Trade Commissar Mikoyan to London, although this is not certain." (Havas, 27th)

(London) Regarding the progress of the Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations, Prime Minister Chamberlain will present a report to the House of Commons on the 31st of this month. The House of Commons, which was originally scheduled to debate foreign policy today, has also postponed the debate until the 31st. At that time, the leader of the opposition Liberal Party, Sir Archibald Sinclair, will be the first to raise questions. In addition, the House of Commons is scheduled to discuss on the 28th the establishment of an intelligence department during wartime and the establishment of an overseas propaganda bureau by the Foreign Office during peacetime. (Havas, 26th)

(Paris) According to French official sources last night, although the military alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union has not yet been signed, a definite outcome can be expected within today. (Associated Press, 27th)

(London) It is announced here that the selection of representatives for the British military delegation to Moscow is currently being made by the British government from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. It is said that there are two issues that must be discussed in the Anglo-French-Soviet general staff talks: (1) the issue of regular technical deployments of troops among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union; (2) determining the scope and nature of Soviet assistance to Romania in wartime, as well as naval measures in the Baltic Sea. (Haitong, 27th)

(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons yesterday that if the Soviet Union wishes to hold general staff talks with British and French Army, Navy, and Air Force inspection teams, the Soviet Union is free to do so. Observers point out that these general staff talks will be the prelude to the conclusion of a tripartite military alliance. Chamberlain avoided questions from Labour Party members about whether Britain would send a military inspection team to Moscow, but admitted that the government had sent new instructions to British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds. Chamberlain stated, "We have sent certain instructions to Moscow, but we have not yet received a response to those instructions." Liberal Party member Mendell questioned the Prime Minister whether France had sent an army inspection team to Moscow. Chamberlain replied, "The British and French governments are cooperating closely." Reliable sources within the government claim that the British government has approved a plan to send an army inspection team to Moscow. A Soviet spokesman here stated that the upcoming general staff talks will be a "true test of the strength of the alliance." (Associated Press, 27th)

(Paris) Well-informed sources here stated last night that the British and French governments have now accepted a definition of what constitutes an act of aggression against the Soviet Union. The Anglo-French-Soviet negotiations have therefore entered a favorable phase. Political figures in Britain and France are confident that the negotiations can be concluded in the short term. Britain and France have also agreed to convene a meeting of the general staffs of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. It is reported that the French military delegation will be headed by General Huntziger, a member of the French Supreme Defense Council and commander of the Levant Military District. (Haitong, 27th)

(London) Regarding the negotiations among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the only remaining difficulty is the definition of "indirect aggression." Soviet sources here stated that since Britain and France have acceded to the Soviet request to allow tripartite general staff talks, the Soviet side may accept a definition of indirect aggression that is satisfactory to Britain in return. Regarding this matter, the British government recently telegraphed new instructions to Ambassador Seeds in Moscow, explaining the British view and instructing him to convey it to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. If concrete results can be achieved in today's talks between the representatives of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, a draft of the tripartite political agreement can be prepared and telegraphed to the British and French governments for their approval. The three governments will also issue a public statement on the 31st of this month, announcing that representatives of their respective general staffs will hold a meeting. Even if the talks today fail to reach an agreement on the definition of indirect aggression, an agreement should be reached on the content and date of the announcement. In addition, it is claimed that the Soviet side stated, "After the political agreement among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is concluded, Stalin will issue a letter to all countries of the world, declaring that since the Soviet Union has rejoined the international community, it will devote all its efforts to maintaining peace, and that domestically, it will focus on industrial and social reconstruction, neither threatening any country nor seeking any territorial gains. If this is the case, the countries along the Baltic Sea can be reassured." (Havas, 27th)

(Paris) According to semi-official sources, General Dominot, commander of the French First Military District, will go to Moscow to participate in the Anglo-French-Soviet general staff talks. (Reuters, 27th)

(Moscow) Foreign Minister Molotov is scheduled to meet with French Ambassador Naggiar, British Ambassador Seeds, and Mr. Strang, head of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, at 5:00 PM today to continue discussions on the conclusion of a political agreement among the three countries and the issue of tripartite general staff talks. (Havas, 27th)

### Polish Concerns: German Conspiracy Against Danzig; Rumors of Hitler's Inspection of East Prussia

(Warsaw) It is widely rumored here that German leader Hitler plans to travel to East Prussia via the Free City of Danzig on August 25th or 26th to attend the commemoration ceremony of the Battle of Tannenberg during World War I. The German cruiser "Königsberg" will also sail to the port of Danzig on August 22nd. Some believe that this trip by Hitler will only provide the city of Danzig with an opportunity to once again express its desire to be annexed to Germany. However, political figures are deeply concerned that Hitler may issue a declaration in the Free City of Danzig that, while claiming to respect Poland's major rights in the city, is actually tantamount to declaring the annexation of the city to German territory. At the same time, the city authorities may also take various administrative measures to gradually eliminate the existing system in the city, such as (1) replacing passports issued by the Danzig Free City authorities with German passports; (2) replacing Danzig currency and stamps with German marks and stamps; (3) dissolving the city council and openly seizing power by the Nazi Party. If this happens, the annexation of the Free City of Danzig to Germany may be quietly realized, without any violent actions or German interference, which is a matter of great concern. However, Poland currently has an armory at Westerplatte in the port of Danzig, which serves as a military symbol of Poland's authority over the city. If the city is gradually annexed to Germany, how to deal with this armory will be a major difficulty. (Havas, 26th)

### German Propaganda Ministry Retaliates Against British Press; Letters Sent to Prominent British Figures; Vehement Criticism of Colonel Kimche

(London) After British political commentator Colonel Kimche repeatedly sent secret letters to the German people, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels reciprocated yesterday by sending multiple letters to prominent British figures, especially Scottish figures. Oddly, many golf club secretaries also received these letters, which were titled "Dr. Goebbels's Response to British Propaganda." The letter stated, "Colonel Kimche, We have noticed that you have sent pamphlets and letters to our people, claiming that you wish to get closer to our people. However, we know that you are employed by your country's Foreign Office. The writing, printing, and mailing of your letters and pamphlets are all authorized and funded by your country's Foreign Minister, Lord Halifax. Your true colors have now been exposed. This is unfortunate for you, but fortunate for us. Although this propaganda is extremely childish and laughable, it is extremely crude and hateful because it comes from Downing Street. In short, what you said is all fabricated. Please tell it to your sailors." (Havas, 27th)

### British Royal Reception for Doctors Coming to China

(London) Lord Horder, the royal physician to King George VI, and his wife hosted a reception today to welcome refugee doctors joining the Chinese Red Cross. Chinese Ambassador Quo Tai-chi was also present. Horder said that the doctors joining the Chinese Red Cross are preparing to face the dangers and hardships of service in China, but they lack medical equipment to carry out their work. He hopes that generous people will donate medical equipment. (Reuters, 26th)

### Dutch Parliament Majority Opposes New Cabinet

(The Hague) It is now known that 32 members of the Catholic Party, 22 members of the Socialist Party, 6 members of the Radical Party, and 3 members of the Communist Party in the parliament will oppose Prime Minister Colijn's new government. Therefore, in theory, only 34 members support the government, while 62 members oppose it. However, at present, no opposition party intends to introduce a motion of "no confidence" in the government. Opposition parties are expected to become active around October when the 1940 budget is presented. (Reuters, 26th)

### Anti-British Movement Intensifies

(Tianjin) British residents in Tanggu and Dagu received warnings today from anti-British Chinese, asking them to leave the two places within four weeks. They also stated that if the British ignore this warning, they cannot guarantee the lives and property of the British in the two places. At the same time, the Japanese blockade of the British and French concessions here has greatly intensified. British people passing through obstacles at the entrance and exit often have to wait for several hours before being allowed to pass. According to the British Consulate, there are 17 British people in Dagu and 11 in Tanggu. As of now, the British side has no preparations to evacuate the British people in the two places. However, women and children spent the night in a barge last night as a precaution. The British gunboat "Santon" is currently stationed in Tanggu for vigilance. (Associated Press, 27th)

(Tianjin) The anti-British tide in Tianjin has not subsided. British residents in Tanggu have now received threatening notices from the so-called Anti-British Committee, demanding that they leave the country within four weeks. If they are unable to leave the country within the deadline due to circumstances, they must notify the committee of the date they intend to leave so that the committee can treat them with "good intentions," but it does not guarantee their lives and property. The threatening notice ends with words such as "Farewell, and wish you a smooth journey." The British residents in Tanggu are mostly employees of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, Jardine Matheson & Co., Kailan Mining Administration, and Butterfield & Swire. (Reuters, 27th)

### Continuous Bombings in London; Irish Terrorists Active; House of Commons Passes Prevention of Violence Act

(London) Bombings occurred continuously in London today. The first incident occurred in the afternoon when two bombs exploded simultaneously in the cloakroom of King's Cross Station, killing one person on the spot and injuring 15 others. The second incident occurred in the evening when a bomb exploded in the luggage room of Victoria Station. The explosion was so powerful that it could be heard 900 yards away. Several people were injured at the time. Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm. The police authorities received the report and immediately implemented special security measures at various stations, especially at the Sitten Viaduct (the largest railway bridge in Britain) on the main line of the Great Northern Railway. (Havas, 26th) (London) As the House of Commons was passing the Prevention of Violence Act tonight, a bomb explosion at a station and shops outside the station destroyed them. It is believed that this was done by sympathizers of the Irish Republican Army. Two taxis were destroyed and 16 people were injured, one of whom died of serious injuries. The terrorists hid the bomb in a handbag and placed the bag in a locker in the luggage storage room on the platform. Another bomb exploded in the cloakroom of Victoria Station, blowing out windows. People fled in all directions, and smoke filled the station. Ambulances and fire engines rushed to the scene, and the police also arrived immediately. Three porters and three others injured in the cloakroom were sent to the hospital. Two other porters were shaken up and treated at the station. (Reuters, 26th)

(London) The Prevention of Violence Act and the British Overseas Airways Act were both passed on the third reading in the House of Commons today and have been sent to the House of Lords. Members of Parliament were very angry after hearing about the recent bomb explosions in London. Therefore, the Prevention of Violence Act was quickly passed in five minutes. The proposal to add another day of consideration to this bill has now been withdrawn. The amended text of the motion, which stipulates that the detention period for suspects who have committed this crime must not exceed 48 hours, has been passed. (Reuters, 26th)

### Hong Kong Tests Blackout

(Hong Kong) Starting tonight, sirens will sound throughout Hong Kong to test the blackout. Wartime lighting control will be continuous throughout the night. However, tonight's test will only be limited to when "enemy aircraft" are approaching. Once the all-clear is given, normal conditions will be restored. After the alarm is sounded, the city will first reduce lighting, and then all traffic will stop, and the city will be dark. Ferries traveling between Hong Kong and Kowloon will be suspended, and only navigation lights will be allowed on ships in the harbor. (Reuters, 27th)

Regarding Anglo-Japanese Negotiations

### International Law Expert Zhou Gengsheng Expresses His Views: If Britain Accepts the Various Conditions, It Will Violate the Nine-Power Treaty; Different Interpretations of the Plan; British Representatives Should Be Very Cautious

(Chongqing) Since representatives of Britain and Japan held meetings in Tokyo, people at home and abroad have speculated and felt uneasy. In order to understand the truth, the reporter specifically visited international law expert Dr. Zhou Gengsheng, who expressed the following views: British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Minister Halifax have repeatedly stated that Britain's fundamental policy towards the Far East will not change due to the Tokyo meetings. Judging from the statements repeatedly issued by the British government and the treaties concluded by Britain with foreign countries, Britain's fundamental policy in the Far East can be divided into several points: (1) Britain cannot recognize de facto or de jure the situation created by the violation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the treaties or agreements concluded by force or other means; (2) Providing moral and material assistance to China and not taking any actions that would weaken China's strength to resist Japan; (3) In principle, recognizing that Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant can be applied to the Sino-Japanese Incident and directly recognizing Japan as an aggressor; (4) Adhering to the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty. Among the various conditions put forward by Japan in this Anglo-Japanese meeting, whether viewed from the perspective of principles or studied individually, if Britain accepts them, it will actually recognize de facto the situation created by Japan, and at the same time weaken China's strength to resist Japan. This would make it impossible for Britain to adhere to the provisions of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant in writing or in spirit, and would violate all the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty. Has Britain forgotten its moral and legal obligations? Is Britain unaware of Japan's conspiracy? Britain has always been a nation that values its promises. I personally believe that Britain will not do this. No matter what, just when the U.S. Congress and the press were discussing the implementation of economic sanctions and retaliation against Japan, the Tokyo meeting was suddenly held, giving a major blow to the calls for sanctions against Japan. This is regrettable. Moreover, Prime Minister Chamberlain's report in the House of Commons on the 24th of this month on the Klesh-Arita agreement is extremely vague in content. Therefore, the result will inevitably lead to various different interpretations. Japanese people like to make exaggerated interpretations of any agreement that are beneficial to them. At present, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma and British Prime Minister Chamberlain have different views on the interpretation of the plan. For the sake of Britain's own interests and for the sake of Britain's allies, the British government and its representatives should be very cautious about the Tokyo meeting. At the same time, I hope that the people of the country should remain calm and not allow Sino-British friendship to be affected by this. In addition, we should also be vigilant at all times to avoid being misled by propaganda and making hasty judgments. (27th dispatch)

### Japanese Troops Blockade Pearl River; Food Supply to Hong Kong Cut Off; A Small Number of Foreigners in Guangdong Searched by Japanese Soldiers; Chinese Entering and Leaving Shameen Subjected to Particularly Strict Searches

(Hong Kong) The recent Japanese blockade of the Pearl River has cut off the food supply to Hong Kong and Macau. The cost of living here has therefore increased. The purpose of the Japanese blockade of the Pearl River is to force the majority of refugees here to return to Guangzhou and to strengthen the Japanese military position in the Guangzhou area because Japanese troops are encountering attacks from Chinese guerrillas there. Regarding Shameen, there is news that foreigners there are not panicked by rumors that Japanese troops will impose a "Tianjin-style blockade" around the foreign concessions. A small number of Europeans have been searched by Japanese sentries stationed around Shameen, but foreigners have not been harassed this week. Chinese entering and leaving the concession are subjected to strict searches. The Japanese authorities claim that the Japanese troops are conducting searches to prevent the smuggling of military currency into foreign concessions. It is said that Chinese speculators in Shameen have caused great fluctuations in the value of Japanese military currency. Japanese officials here claim that the Japanese blockade of the Pearl River is purely a military operation because Japanese troops are engaged in "mopping-up" operations in the Pearl River Delta. (Associated Press, 27th)

(Guangzhou) The city-wide search of Chinese people, which began on July 21, stopped this morning. It is believed that Japanese soldiers have often been shot at by armed Chinese people, so the Japanese side took this search action. (Reuters, 26th)

(Ningbo Correspondence) The Ningbo Maritime Affairs Office recently received instructions from the Ministry of Communications, stating that since the outbreak of the war, many seafarers have become unemployed, and their lives are difficult. The Ministry is deeply concerned and should be coordinated by the government to provide relief and utilize them. It is instructed to investigate and report to the Ministry in detail for overall handling.

### Japanese Troops in West Shanghai Rush to Build the Hongxin Road

(Qingpu Correspondence) Japanese troops in West Shanghai, feeling threatened by the Chinese army, began rushing to build the Hongxin (Hongqiao-Xinqiao, Songjiang Prefecture) Road on the 23rd. The road builders are mostly villagers from the nearby area, in addition to some Japanese troops from West Shanghai. The road project is extremely simple, which shows the urgency of the need. It is generally expected that because the military strength in West Shanghai is insufficient to cope, the Japanese side intends to use transportation to increase the deployment of troops from Songjiang and other places at any time in order to defend against the advance of the Chinese army. Yesterday afternoon, more than a dozen Japanese soldiers, disguised as Chinese merchants, took two civilian boats to spy near Qibao Town, Puhuitang. They were discovered by Chinese troops, who immediately dispatched more than 20 elite soldiers to attack. The Japanese troops retreated towards Xujiahui.

### Opening of Irrigation Gate Along the Canal to Release the Yellow River and Huai River Flooding

(Xinghua Correspondence) The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously ordered the Canal Works Bureau and the Huai'an County Government to open all the sluice gates along the canal to prevent the rise of the Yellow River and Huai River and to take care of farmland irrigation, considering that the water level in the lower reaches of the river was low. It is now known that the Provincial Government has successively reported from the Canal Works Bureau that the Gaoyou City North Toutou Sluice, City South Huoyao Sluice, Wanlü'an, Tubu, Pipa Sluice, and Tonghu Bridge have been completely cleared. It also transferred the remaining sluice gates along the embankment and opened the sluice gates to the greatest extent possible to facilitate drainage. At the same time, the Provincial Government also reported from the Zhun'an County Government that the sluice gates within the county's jurisdiction had been completely opened long ago. However, because the riverbeds of the diversion rivers of each sluice gate are shallow and most of the mouths are silted up, the flow of each diversion river is very small. It has now been transferred and instructed the district chiefs of each district along the embankment in the county to requisition people to dredge the upper and lower diversion rivers of each sluice gate to facilitate unobstructed drainage.

### All of the Pseudo-Security Corps in Taicang Revolts

(Taicang Correspondence) After Geng Chao, the deputy commander of the Taicang Pseudo-Security Corps, was killed in a design ambush by the 4th Regiment of the 2nd District Security Force of Jiangsu Province in Xintang City last month and more than 100 pseudo-soldiers were captured, the Japanese authorities immediately transferred several military officers and brought more than 100 pseudo-soldiers who had been tricked by Geng Chao to the county seat for training to Xintang to fill the defense and assist the pseudo-county government in collecting land taxes. At that time, the commanders of the Jiangnan Volunteer Army, He Kexi and Wu Gang, led more than 1,000 combatants to Taicang County, contacted Wang Shilan, the commander of the 4th Regiment, and attacked Xintang City in groups at 2:00 a.m. on the 3rd. The combatants of the Liao Detachment first climbed onto the Japanese soldiers' housing and threw hand grenades, bombing and killing more than a dozen Japanese soldiers and capturing two alive. As soon as the pseudo-Security Corps members heard that the guerrillas had arrived, they fled in all directions. Later, the pseudo-soldiers were motivated by patriotism and intended to revolt. Director Tang learned that the pseudo-soldiers had such an intention to revolt and ventured to persuade them. The pseudo-army captain scheduled an uprising to implement the revolt. Unexpectedly, the matter was not confidential and was discovered by the Japanese military department. Suddenly, on the 17th, a large number of Japanese troops were dispatched to surround Xintang City, intending to confiscate the pseudo-soldiers' guns. Before the Japanese troops arrived, the team leader, Cang Shenxiu, and others led more than 100 team members, each carrying a rifle, to withdraw from Xintang City and rushed to Wang's regiment to surrender. Regiment Commander Wang and Director Tang immediately reorganized the unit and reported it to the provincial government for approval.

### Japanese Troops Hastily Build Defenses in Suzhou, Chinese Regular Army Presses Forward Steadily

Suzhou Dispatch: All the towns and villages outside Fengmen in this county are in the waterlogged area, hence surrounded by water on all sides and the only waterway connecting Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Recently, due to the steady advance of the Chinese regular army, the Japanese troops are engaged in building defensive works. For days, the Japanese army has been forcibly conscripting large numbers of Chinese people from inside and outside the city, assigning them to dig ingot-shaped trenches at strategic points in the surrounding countryside to prevent attacks by the Chinese army. According to those who have been conscripted and returned, they were first detained in wooden houses after being conscripted by the Japanese army. Around 10 PM, large numbers of laborers were escorted onto barges specifically for transporting goods, towed by motorboats, and taken to the wilderness outside Fengmen. Observing the terrain, it seemed to be between Chefang and Xietang. They lit specially prepared kerosene lamps during work, and after six hours of work, they were ordered back onto the boats and returned to the original place. This went on for seven days, but the locations varied each day, sometimes near Taihu Lake. During these seven days, they were never fed adequately. Their work involved either transporting mud to build earth forts or digging trenches five feet deep, with the tasks varying from day to day. During each work session, countless Chinese people were knocked down by the Japanese army using wooden sticks.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Taixian, Prosperous Areas Also Suffer Tragic Bombing

Taixian Special Dispatch: At 8:21 AM on the 23rd of this month, three Japanese planes were suddenly spotted over the city of Taixian, circling for about an hour. They first strafed the city with machine guns, and then indiscriminately bombed the most prosperous commercial areas outside the city, including Beida Street and Pozi Street, causing damage to Tianfu Silk and Cloth Store, the nearby Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant, money shops, clothing stores, and department stores. Several bombs also fell on the open areas around the large parade ground inside the city, but fortunately, there were no major casualties. This was because the people maintained order and obeyed the instructions of the air defense personnel during the circling and bombing of the Japanese planes, and their attitude was exceptionally calm. In addition, women and children had already been evacuated.

### Jiangsu Construction Department Increases Production, Improves Cotton Production

Xinghua Dispatch: In order to increase production, the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department is improving the cotton production in the coastal counties of the province and improving agricultural products throughout the province.

### Finance - Wild Surges and Plunges: Spot Reached the 4,000 Yuan Mark; Cancellation of the US-Japan Treaty Triggers Reversal

Yesterday, the spot black market price of Gold Bullion (烚赤) continued its fluctuating state. Generally, it rose first and then fell, with a difference of 175 yuan between the high and low points. Initially, due to news that HSBC was more willing to buy than sell in the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate tightened, and market sentiment was bullish. Although some money changers initially tended to sell, securities firms and certain gold shops aggressively absorbed currency, further supported by a money changer who stopped selling and started buying as prices rose. The market once reached a high of 4,015 yuan. Later, a Reuters telegram reported the cancellation of the US-Japan commercial treaty, and the domestic foreign exchange market strengthened, causing pessimistic sentiment to dissipate. Many operators quickly shifted their targets and tended to close out positions. However, buyers hesitated during the decline, and the market eventually closed at 3,865 yuan, a net increase of 70 yuan. There were many twists and turns during the day, but no significant turbulence. Due to the supply of negotiable instruments and cash, transactions were mostly small-scale, with a total of over 1,000 taels. Gold jewelry prices also rose and then fell. The Greater Shanghai Jewellers Association once created an unprecedented high price of 405 yuan, eventually closing up 5 yuan. Customs Gold remained flat, while Chinese Gold and other types of pure gold continued to rise.

Gold Bullion Still Up 70 Yuan

From the morning, operators initially raised prices by 65 yuan per bar (ten taels) because they saw reports that the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee would no longer maintain the foreign exchange rate of the non-occupied areas. Furthermore, there were rumors that HSBC was more willing to buy than sell in the domestic foreign exchange market, further boosting market confidence. Gold shops bought ten taels from money changers at a price of 3,860 yuan. A certain money changer suddenly tried to sell over a hundred taels, causing a temporary pullback. A money changer sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 3,850 yuan, and then sold another 30 taels to gold shops at a price of 3,840 yuan, which was the lowest price of the day. Although a certain money changer still intended to sell, the tightening of foreign exchange rates triggered buying. A certain gold shop (acting for Hong Kong speculators) and securities firms competed to absorb currency, and the market quickly rebounded. Soon, it broke through the 3,900 yuan mark. Securities firms bought ten taels from gold shops at a price of 3,920 yuan. Later, a certain money changer aggressively sold over a hundred taels again, so the price fell back below the 3,900 yuan mark. A money changer sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop (acting for Hong Kong speculators) at a price of 3,860 yuan. However, soon after, news came that the foreign exchange rate was tightening, and the securities firms absorbed currency again. In addition, a certain money changer also stopped selling and started buying, causing the upward trend to resume vigorously and again surpass the 3,900 yuan mark. A money changer bought a total of 20 taels from gold shops at a price of 3,960 yuan. This was around noon. Later, the same money changer bought another ten taels from gold shops at 3,950 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning session. In the afternoon, news came that the US dollar exchange rate had weakened by 38 yuan, so the market was even stronger, opening up 60 yuan and breaking through the 4,000 yuan mark. Money changers bought 20 taels from cash shops at a price of 4,010 yuan. Then they raised the price by five yuan again, and money changers bought 30 taels from cash shops at a price of 4,015 yuan, which was the highest price of the day. At one point, it hovered between 4,010 yuan and 4,000 yuan. Around 2:30 PM, news came that the US-Japan Commercial Treaty had been cancelled, and the foreign exchange rate weakened. The market price immediately reversed. Securities firms and cash shops competed to sell aggressively. In addition, gold shops also tracked and hedged sales, and buyers generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The market successively broke through the 4,000 yuan and 3,900 yuan marks. Cash shops sold 30 taels to money changers at a price of 3,860 yuan. Later, money changers traded 50 taels among themselves at 3,865 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening session. As a result, it still closed up 70 yuan compared to the previous day. (It was heard that after the close, securities firms sold another ten taels to cash shops at a price of 3,860 yuan.) It has risen for four consecutive days, a total of 395 yuan. The price fluctuated by 175 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the current brand gold from bullion shops is about 10 yuan higher than that of the Gold Bullion (烚赤), and the spot price is about 50 yuan lower than the listed price. According to inquiries, there were some transactions.

### Importers Compete to Buy; Sterling Strengthens Sharply

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices remain unchanged. The black market for sterling fluctuated greatly. Initially, due to the newspaper reports that the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee would no longer maintain the black market, importers were very panicked and competed to buy aggressively. In addition, Chinese cotton yarn merchants and Japanese banks were also active. Furthermore, the Bank of England and HSBC sold very little spot currency and were very willing to buy, causing the market to tighten significantly. At one point, sterling was called over four shillings and 625 pence, and the US dollar was also called over 7.875 yuan. Later, a Reuters telegram reported that the US Senate had passed the abolition of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty signed in 1911, causing buyers to adopt a wait-and-see attitude. In addition, sudden and continuous selling from Hong Kong telegraphs and the Bombay Bank caused the tightening trend to be less severe. At noon, it was heard that the Bank of England was closing out its positions for this month and arbitraging into August, posting a premium of US$0.0875, a monthly interest rate (excluding commissions) of about 1.15 cents. Trading was still active. The Hong Kong exchange rate tightened sharply, and the selling price was reportedly softened to 28 yuan and 50 cents.

Foreign Banks Offer Very Little

In the early morning, the London exchange rate was down 1.875 for both near and far dates. The New York silver price was stable. The London gold price was up half a penny. The exchange rate between sterling and the US dollar was down slightly by 3 cents, and the exchange rate with Shanghai was down 125. The exchange rate with France remained flat. The exchange rate between the US dollar and sterling was unchanged. The exchange rate with Shanghai was down 15 cents, and the exchange rate with France was unchanged. The listed rates of the Central Bank were the same as before. The opening spot selling prices of banks in the morning were 4 shillings and 3475 pence for sterling and 8.4375 yuan for the US dollar, unchanged from the closing prices of the previous day. After the opening, exporters first sold spot sterling to HSBC at 4 shillings and 375 pence. Then, importers came to buy, but HSBC offered very little and was very willing to buy, but slightly sold August futures. The market softened. When the HSBC listed prices were announced, they were unchanged. When the Silver Balancing Tax was announced, it was still exempt. After that, foreign firms settled and bought spot US dollars from a certain bank at 8.375 yuan. After 10:30 AM, more foreign firms closed short positions. In addition, Chinese merchants, such as cotton yarn merchants, were also active, causing the market to tighten further.

Hong Kong Continues to Sell in the Afternoon

The market was still tight at the beginning of the afternoon session. Japanese banks bought spot US dollars from a certain bank at 8 yuan. Suddenly, foreign news reported that the US-Japan Commercial Treaty signed in 1911 had been cancelled, so the buying from speculators and foreign firms stopped. In addition, foreign cables from Hong Kong and the Bombay Bank came to sell aggressively, so prices gradually strengthened. Hong Kong telegraphs and the Bombay Bank successively sold spot sterling to foreign firms and foreign banks, strengthening from 4 shillings and 1625 pence to 21875 pence.

### Foreign Currency Rises Sharply

Yesterday, foreign currencies rose sharply due to the weakening of foreign exchange rates and the sharp rise in Gold Bullion (烚赤). Demand was strong, and market prices soared. In the afternoon, news came that the US-Japan Commercial Treaty had been abolished, and the supply became smoother. The market situation stabilized. As a result, the prices of sterling banknotes and US dollar banknotes rose sharply. If the international situation can improve, there is hope for foreign currencies to soften and fall back.

### Securities - Far Eastern Bank Shares Rise; Chinese Domestic Debt Remains Weak

The securities black market weakened again yesterday after rising for two consecutive days. Gold and debentures continued to rise endlessly. Public confidence in exchange drafts and bills weakened further. Public bonds are in a sense exchange drafts, and their environment is surrounded by various factors, so they cannot rise. Most transactions on the market aim to close out positions with small profits. Very few investors exist, and the tendency is that buying is not easy to raise, and selling is easy to slump when entries and exits are slightly large, which is in the reverse proportion to the situation in the first half of June. The surrounding haze does not dissipate, and it is not easy to hope for a rise. It can be said that it is a turbulent time. Yesterday's transactions were even worse. Neither buying nor selling was enthusiastic. Lianhe, Tongkang and other firms bought slightly more, while Songmao sold more than bought. Northern merchants were still selling, such as the 14th, Defu 8th and Tongyu. The range of rises and falls has become smaller. As a result, except for Grade A which was stable, the rest all fell by 0.1 to 0.6 yuan. The total number of transactions was about 400,000. A simple table is listed below:

Category	Highest	Lowest	Closing	Compared to Previous Day

Grade A	52.20	51.20	52.00	Flat

Grade B	43.40	42.80	43.40	Down 0.10

Grade C	42.00	41.45	41.80	Down 0.55

Grade D	41.30	40.50	41.00	Down 0.60

Grade E	41.70	41.15	41.35	Down 0.60

For stock transactions, 180 shares of China Bookstore were traded at a price of 26.4 yuan.

According to the report of the Public Securities Exchange, all stocks in this city continued to show weakness yesterday. However, there were no crowded sellers on the market, but only those who settled foreign exchange for July had to settle their payments next Monday. This day also happened to be the settlement day of this exchange. Since the forward exchange rate was even higher, the exchange forced the sale of stocks that were easy to sell to obtain funds, so the prices of each stock fell, and the closing market was very weak. The comparison between the opening price and the closing price is listed below:

Opening	Closing

Tram Stock	42.75 yuan	41.5 yuan

Jardine Stock	19.1 yuan	18.5 yuan

Telephone Stock	12.6 yuan	11.8 yuan

Electricity Preference Stock	120 yuan	117.5 yuan

Previous Stock

The recent new low price was seen again today, such as the International Trust share price of 3.25 yuan, the Wharf share price of 29.5 yuan, and the Yesson share price of 112 yuan. Rubber stocks were also affected by this, and the price was still stable.

HSBC shares rose by half a pound each, with British registered shares at £78 1/2 and Hong Kong registered shares at £78. Kuala Lumpur Rubber shares fell back by 1.5 pence, with a price of 12 shillings and 10.5 pence. The market price of Chinese foreign debt was unchanged.

### Cotton Yarn - Strong Bullish Sentiment; Buying Resumes in the Yarn Market; Much Arbitrage in Japanese Yarn

The yarn market turned up, because gold rose again, and rumors abounded, saying that there were more foreign exchange rumors. Although actual demand was clear, the market was covered by strong bullish sentiment, and actual buying resumed. The current price of 20s Double Horse was high, and it would meet 561 yuan. However, demand in South China decreased greatly. It was heard in the afternoon that exchange drafts continued to contract, and black market transactions increased compared to the morning. The price of a 10s Double Horse warehouse receipt was 555 yuan, and the 20s Special Golden City saw a new peak price of 630 yuan.

The situation of spot yarn: At the beginning of the morning opening, because rumors were rife, and the market unanimously looked good, the opening price was still flat, up 3-4 yuan. The price of 20s Double Horse foreign warehouse stock was 557 yuan. However, warehouse receipt stock was more profitable, with the opening price at 545 yuan, plus 5-6 yuan. But actual demand was average, and the Hong Kong merchants' purchasing capacity was very narrow. The market situation was still peaceful, but the general practitioners were very bullish and their thoughts were very strong, so they came to buy again, and with the good news, they moved forward again. The closing price of 20s Double Horse foreign warehouse stock was 560 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 546.5 yuan. It was found that 805 packages were traded in half a day, and 90 packages were traded in the afternoon of the previous day. The prices of 20s Double Horse rose by 6 yuan, Shepherd rose by 3.5 yuan, and Double Earth rose by 7 yuan. The Yong'an Factory opened 120 packages of 20s Special Golden City, with a price of 630 yuan, which was taken by the Hong Kong merchants. Today, 1,250 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong, 120 pieces will be shipped to Beihai, and 120 pieces will be shipped to Guangzhou Bay. The amounts bought by each gang are listed as follows:

Dealers	570	Hong Kong	235

Statistics	805

The Japanese yarn market rose sharply. The price of this month's goods has risen very strongly, but actual demand has not developed very much. The popularity is very strong. The factors for its firmness are that the yarn market has been weak for a long time, and the price difference between this month and next month is too large, which has attracted arbitrage. Therefore, the situation has tightened, and the rising power has become stronger. The current price of 20s Yueqin is 427-8 yuan, up 14 yuan, and the price for next month is 442 yuan. However, the debenture discount is still high.

### Japanese Factories Purchase Indian Cotton - All Transactions Are in Cash

Indian cotton transactions: Japanese factories purchased exclusively well, importing 1,800 pieces, and all payments were made in cash to the factory. This cotton was all purchased by flower merchants in the past, and has been resold to Japanese factories, making a large profit. Chinese factories are still dull and do not purchase, probably due to the shortage of legal tender. However, the mutual buying and selling among the industry is still lively, and it is also a cash transaction. However, kapok business is quiet and lifeless. The source in Northern Jiangsu is still not interrupted. 249 packages of fine velvet flowers arrived at the dock. The current cotton situation is as follows:

Another report: Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions: due to the difficulty of financial adjustment, spot goods are not easy to sell for a while, so the selling price is more than ten yuan cheaper per dan than the fixed goods, and no one is interested in it for a while. In recent days, there have been a few people in the industry who have settled prices with foreign firms. This is a high view of the operators.

Foreign cotton market prices: New York cotton market: the opening price of India rose by 2 pounds, and then rose due to telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai. Due to export subsidies, it attracted buying from many overseas merchants. Bank buying in the market was also very strong, and spot transactions turned active. Yesterday, Agriculture Secretary Henry Thielers announced the determination of New York, Washington, Savannah, New Orleans, Houston. Five places were designated as cotton export ports, and commissioners were stationed to handle export registration matters. Yesterday, New York rose by more than 10 pounds, India together with forecasts rose by 2 Robis, and Egypt rose by more than 20 pounds.

### Piece Goods - Eastern Piece Squeezed Short; Domestic Cloth Slackens

Domestic Cloth

Although the cost of weaving and manufacturing has increased, the sales market is restricted by actual sales and financial resources, making it difficult to keep up with the increase. There are still cheap goods due to expire this month, which must be sold later. At the same time, the factory's end-of-month payment is huge, and they are also willing to sell some of their inventory without raising prices temporarily. Therefore, the sales market is relaxed outside and tight inside. Yihua coarse cloth has risen by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan per piece, and the opening price of fine cloth and fine twill is flat. Fine woolen cloth, serge, blue cloth, and cloth for foreign trade are raised by 0.15 to 0.3 yuan per piece. There is still demand for summer silk plain fabric in this street, and the selling price has also risen by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. Current sales are uniquely good for Hong Kong and Nanyang merchants. Transactions included more than 4,000 pieces of dyed cloth, dyed twill, red label, bleached cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth. This street imported more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth, coarse and fine twill, velvet cloth, and serge. Shenxin Factory opened more than 100 pieces of Fugui fine cloth and fine twill, including 50 pieces that were sold to Kunming.

Eastern Piece

Yesterday, white fine cloth and fine twill in this street rose sharply due to the Northern merchants searching for cash, and the market was uniformly squeezed short. The Longtou and Yangguan brands rose 0.8 to 0.9 yuan per piece. The current market price of Longtou spot goods is 15.3 yuan, and the price for next month's goods must be 15.75 yuan. The sales price of Yanghe fine twill is 14.2 yuan, which is also an increase of 0.35 yuan compared to the previous day. Dongmian Foreign Firm opened 50 packages of Yanghe fine cloth, with a price of 15 yuan. The best transactions of the day were more than 600 packages of spot fine cloth of various brands, which were imported by the Qinhuangdao and Tianjin merchants. Short covering and dyeing sales in Mujie also reached 500 to 600 pieces. Dyed goods, such as Yuanzhi tribute, have risen to 0.45 yuan per yard.

Exports

Piece goods exported on the 28th: 150 pieces to Hong Kong, 50 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 3 pieces to Beihai, 20 pieces to Singapore, and 50 pieces to Ningbo.

### Food - No Samples of Various Goods; Rice Market Stagnates

Domestic Rice

The market has already shown a state of stagnation. Except for 700 to 800 packages of Wuhu Jiankai sold for 16 yuan, and 125 packages of Biang Yuan station cars sold for 22 yuan, there were no samples of japonica and indica rice on the market. In this situation, if there is no remedial measure, the rice in the shops will be exhausted in about a week. At that time, the rice supply in Shanghai will inevitably cause panic. It is hoped that the authorities will quickly seek good measures to remedy it. The city's sources: no arrivals from the river, and only 1,300 to 1,400 packages from carriage transportation.

Customer Indica

Yesterday's market still used Bomi rice as the authentic transaction. Retailers and local merchants in this street continued to handle it. The total market traded 3,000 packages of coarse Bom and Jueji indica rice. Because of the strict enforcement of the price limit, the market price still did not differ much from the previous market. However, according to grain merchants, there is still effort in progress to lift the ban on Wumi, or it may be announced and implemented on the first of next month.

Foreign Rice

Yesterday, there were few in and out. The market only opened 300 to 400 packages of New Saigon, and the market price has been stabilized, still opening at 25.5 yuan. As for the continued order of foreign rice, it is the only important plan in the current reduction of inventory. It is heard that rice merchants are in consultation.

### Sugar Market - Dutch Red Opens More Than 6,000 Packages

### Silk and Tea - Factory Silk Maintains Strong High Status; Silk Reeled in Chibli (輯里) Opens at 2,000 Yuan

The silk market in this port is still firmly rising. The market situation yesterday was fresher than ever. The Chibli silk, made by New York City brand, opened at 2,000 yuan, and the other six silk filatures have risen to 1,800 yuan, which is a daily change. White factory, made by Shanghai RR, has a price of 3,200 yuan, and tin silk is 3,100 yuan, all maintaining a strong high advantage. Da Chang, Ren Chang and other companies opened 90 bundles.

Yokohama silk price spot 1,300 yuan, up 10 yuan, long-term rose 5 yuan. However, according to Yokohama long-distance radio news in the afternoon, the United States may have decided to revise part of the Neutrality Act, which will affect US-Japan trade. Therefore, Yokohama silk prices fell back, with spot prices falling 30 yuan and long-term prices falling 24 yuan.

### North and South Goods: Cloud Ear Fungus and Peach Kernels Rising Steadily; New Dates Available

Cloud Ear Fungus: Recently, the source has been obstructed again, coupled with high premium costs, leading to a sharp increase. A new batch of goods has been released, with prices rising by more than thirty yuan, settling at two hundred and fifty-two yuan. Market prices have increased accordingly, but the market remains tight, with an upward trend expected.

Peach Kernels: Cold-stored Tianjin peach kernels have seen prices soar recently due to strong demand. Tianjin peach kernels have risen to one hundred and ten yuan (paper currency), more than forty yuan higher than at the end of last month. Tiger skin peaches are at seventy-five yuan, also up more than twenty yuan. The tight trend has not weakened, and further increases are expected. Walnut prices have increased less significantly, with hand-picked peaches at fifty-five yuan, Dongchang peaches at forty-four yuan, and southern peaches at thirty to thirty-one yuan.

Dates: The first batch of Suzhou dates has already appeared on the market. Five pieces have arrived. Due to the long-term shortage of old goods, they are selling exceptionally well. The price of *tutou* dates has risen to eighty-five yuan. It is reported that Jiaxing dates will also be available soon, and the market is very tight.

### Coal: Henan Shortage; Door-Front Shops Switch to Selling Haifeng Coal

Henan white coal has not been available since the war due to transportation disruptions in the production areas. The city's sales have relied on pre-war stocks to survive. Recently, as the bottom stock is about to run out and the sales market is booming, supply is falling short of demand, and a sense of urgency is growing. Suppliers are taking advantage of the scarcity of goods. Coal traders are asking for seventy-five yuan per ton for bulk coal, but there are no large batches of warehouse receipts available. Therefore, the door-front shops on this street have had to change course and switch to selling Xunfeng white coal, but the cost is relatively high, requiring seventy-seven yuan per ton.

### Import and Export

Today (the 28th), a large quantity of goods was shipped to Hong Kong, including 1,190 bags of soybeans, 2,470 bags of raw peanuts, 130 pieces of crude oil, and 250 pieces of fresh eggs. In addition, 2,300 bags of soybeans were shipped to Singapore.

### Except for Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou Banknotes, All Local Legal Tender is Generally Accepted; Banks and Money Shops Do Not Refuse to Use Them; Bank of Communications Banknotes Are Fully Usable

After the Chinese government made every effort to maintain the value of legal tender, the legal tender reserves remained sufficient, with cash accounting for more than 60%, which was deeply trusted by the people of the whole country and friendly countries. In order to prevent speculation and encourage capital inflow into the interior, two regulations on the collection and exchange of banknotes from Tianjin, Shandong and Hankou were promulgated. After that, the exchange craze in Shanghai subsided, and the remittance into the interior surged. New Life News reporters learned from the banking sector yesterday that, regarding

Banknotes from Other Places, except for those from Tianjin, Shandong (including Shandong, Jinan, Qingdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, etc.) and Hankou, all Shanghai markets accept and use them fully, and banks and money shops do not refuse to accept them. As for Zhejiang Xingye, China Industrial, Siming, Bank of Communications, Agricultural and Industrial, Agricultural and Commercial, Reclamation and South China and other commercial banks’ banknotes, in addition to those from Tianjin, Shandong and Hankou and the Bank of Communications

being handled in the same way, because the issuing reserves of each bank have long been taken over by the Issuing Reserve Management Committee, they are used in the same way as legal tender. Therefore, those holding banknotes of various commercial banks other than Tianjin, Shandong and Hankou place names can exchange Shanghai place name banknotes from the designated China, Central, and Bank of Communications. In short, in addition to those from Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou, other place name banknotes can be

fully used, and bondholders should not discriminate against them. However, speculators are devaluing and buying banknotes from Tianjin, Shandong, and Hankou place names. It is hoped that bondholders will not be fooled. According to financial sources, the Huaxing banknotes supported by the Japanese and puppet regimes are mostly distributed in the suburbs of Shanghai, but they can only be forced to be used in the occupied areas and will never have the opportunity to circulate in the isolated island. Residents oppose the use of these notes, and banks have no intention of accepting

or using them at all. In addition, all banks now have strong preparations for storing existing reserves in their vaults. It is hoped that all sectors will no longer lightly believe rumors and inducements and cause unnecessary panic. As for the Shanghai branches of China, Central and Bank of Communications, they are all willing to take on the important responsibility of stabilizing the financial market and will listen to the orders of the Chongqing head office for all calming measures and means. They are determined to break any abnormal rumors from now on.

### Zhenhai and Haimen are Repeatedly Bombed; Japanese Ships Bomb Tongjiao in Fenghua

According to shipping industry sources, Japanese aircraft once flew to Ningbo for reconnaissance, only distributing absurd leaflets and not dropping bombs. Japanese warships sailed to the waters of Longshan, Xiepu Township, north of Nanhong Town, and fired artillery shells at the shore, firing more than 30 shells in an attempt to cover the Japanese army's landing. The defending Chinese army inflicted a heavy blow on them, and they were eventually forced to retreat. Japanese warships in the waters of Hukoubo, Fenghua Port, also bombarded Tongjiao on the northwest coast, causing aimless harassment. The shells landed in barren fields and caused no damage. The Chinese army in various coastal areas is now on high alert. At 2 p.m. on the 26th, three Japanese aircraft invaded Haimen and dropped five or six bombs, causing very little damage.

### The Nanhua Line is Repeatedly Hit; Qingyuan Sets Sail for Singapore This Morning; Guiyang Will Also Join

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, China's coastline has been controlled by the Japanese Navy, and foreign exports have also been obstructed. In the past, such cases have been numerous and reported in newspapers. Since the fall of Guangzhou, foreign ships operating on the Nanhua route have suffered considerable blows, with Jardine Matheson and Taikoo suffering the greatest losses. The two companies have sought new ways to open up the coastal defense route and Guangzhou Bay and Shantou shipping is more prosperous than before. Therefore, the losses from the suspension of shipping in Guangzhou have been recovered. Unexpectedly, Shantou was lost again in late last month, resulting in the severance of the Shanghai-Shantou, Hong Kong-Shantou, and Shantou-to-Nanyang routes. Foreign ships have suffered another blow. Taikoo has changed the Shantou-to-Siam route to a Shanghai-Siam route, and the Suzhou and Zhangjiakou ships have already sailed. The company is also planning to expand to Nanyang and has sent the Qingyuan to test the route to Singapore. Passengers and cargo have been loaded, and it is scheduled to set sail at 8:30 this morning, calling at Hong Kong and Guangzhou Bay before sailing directly to Singapore. As for the Zhangjiakou, which previously sailed the Nanyang route from Shantou, it has arrived in Shanghai to operate the Shanghai-Siam route. It is reported that the Guiyang will also arrive in Shanghai on the 2nd of next month to join the new route.

### Shao Shijun Secretly Travels to Japan

Shao Shijun, with someone supporting him, has been the head of the "Unified Tax Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Provinces" for more than a year. Because of his sophisticated methods and skillful appropriation, he has transformed from a poor scholar into a wealthy man with millions of assets. However, the staff in the "Bureau" follow suit, engaging in corruption and embezzlement, which Shao cannot control, resulting in the internal corruption becoming increasingly serious and corruption cases emerging one after another. The "Reformed Government" was dissatisfied long ago. Now, using this as an excuse, he was forced to resign and be replaced by Yan. Shao was panicked when he heard this. First, he went to Beijing to seek help, and then secretly went to Japan to lobby various parties, intending to cling to his position and continue his desire to plunder.

### Employee Subsidies at the Telephone Company

The Shanghai Telephone Company, in view of the recent high prices of goods and the general suffering of employees, has increased subsidies from July. Salaries above 200 yuan will be increased by 25%, and those above 100 yuan will be increased by 45%. In addition, a few yuan will be added as rice subsidies. However, small employees below 100 yuan will not receive any additional subsidies except for a small amount of rice subsidies, which has caused considerable dissatisfaction within the company.

### Financials Become Active After the United States Revokes the Trade Treaty with Japan; Black Market Foreign Exchange Loosens and Gold Recovers; The Market Generally Believes It is Beneficial to China

The Shanghai foreign exchange black market, due to rumors that the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee would not maintain it and HSBC Bank restricted supply, the shrinkage of the foreign exchange black market was drastic again yesterday morning. Although the HSBC listing did not change, the British exchange rate was 4 shillings and the US exchange rate was 7.75 yuan, but the actual market price was lower than the previous day. It is estimated that the British exchange rate was 4 shillings 25 cents, and the US exchange rate was 8.215 yuan. Subsequently, because the US State Department announced the abolition of the US-Japan Commercial and Navigation Treaty, and the British Foreign Secretary stated in the House of Commons that the policy toward China had not changed, the Shanghai financial market generally believed that it was beneficial to China. Therefore, the foreign exchange black market loosened, and speculators emerged one after another. As for the gold black market gathering place, the price rose to 3,920 yuan after opening yesterday morning. The morning closing price was 3,950 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 21,865 yuan. The silver shop Dahang yesterday listed it at 405 yuan, and last night it was 390 yuan. The exchange rate spread rose to 260 yuan yesterday morning and then fell back to 230 yuan.

### Concession Authorities Thoroughly Investigate Rice Storage in Firms and Warehouses; Ask Silver and Money Industries to Tighten Rice Mortgages; Jiuda's License Revoked and Temporarily Suspended

After the Public Concession’s Public Works Department and the French Concession's Public Works Bureau strictly enforced the price limits on the rice market, it was confirmed that Jiuda Rice Shop at No. 780 Julu Road exceeded the price limits. The manager of the shop, Wang Yusheng (i.e., Wang Youren), who was arrested in the market a few days ago, has been reprimanded by the Market Management Committee and released by the Public Works Department. However, his market entry permit has been revoked and he is prohibited from trading in the market. As for the rice shop, in addition to the French Public Works Bureau sending police to order the sale of all top-quality white rice below the limit price of 210 yuan, the business license was revoked yesterday morning. The shop announced a temporary suspension of business starting yesterday morning. Thorough Investigation and Disposal of Speculation

The rice in the Chinese, Zhejiang Xingye, Bank of Communications, China Industrial, Reclamation, Donglai, and Shanghai banks and warehouses in the Shanghai Concession area is the most. It is reported that in order to prevent hoarding, speculation, and manipulation, the Concession authorities will thoroughly investigate the amount of rice stored in each bank, money shop, and warehouse, as well as the names of the owners, strictly enforce the price limits, crack down on speculation, and advise foreigners not to speculate in rice. It has been learned that the Concession authorities have measures to deal with hoarders and have asked the silver and money industry to tighten rice mortgages to prevent fueling speculation. The rumors about relaxing the rice price limits have been firmly denied by the authorities. Assign Personnel to Supervise and Permit Reporting

The rice market on Fuzhou Road is still supervised daily by supervisors assigned by the Concession authorities. Yesterday, someone reported to the French police that Gongda Xin Rice Shop at No. 95 Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession had exceeded the 20 yuan price limit. The Public Works Bureau revoked the shop's business license, and it was not returned until the afternoon. Therefore, the rice shop is still operating as usual, but it is said that it was a misunderstanding, and the business license was returned after the facts were clarified. The Guild Publishes a List of Rice Storage Warehouses

The Bean and Rice Industry Guild yesterday released the 17th report on the amount of rice stored in grain warehouses, with a total of 231,337 bags, a decrease of 69,144 bags from the previous period. The Bank of China warehouse has the most, with 36,589 bags, followed by the Zhejiang Xingye warehouse with 35,993 bags, Maotai Warehouse with 24,516 bags, China Industrial Warehouse with 21,476 bags, Longmao Warehouse with 10,884 bags, Xinhua Bank Warehouse with 8,1383 bags, Zikangzhuang Warehouse with 6,0388 bags, Dinghe Warehouse with 5,819 bags, and Zhengfeng Warehouse with 5,069 bags. The Market is Chaotic and Underground Trading is More Rampant

Yesterday morning, the market trading was still chaotic, and top-quality rice was nowhere to be found. However, underground trading suddenly became rampant. It is said that those engaged in underground trading use the market to make contact and then go outside to negotiate deals directly, without signing any transaction documents. It is said that the price of top-quality white rice has reached 32.8 yuan, exceeding the price limit by 2.8 yuan. Only glutinous rice and Tianjin rice are traded in the market. As for the firms of the Market Management Committee, there has been no trading since Monday, because they are limited by the ban and refuse underground trading. It is said that the Concession authorities have sent detectives to secretly investigate firms engaged in private underground trading in order to investigate and deal with them. The Source is Sufficient to Regulate

The representatives of the rice industry groups visited Mr. Hede Kui, Deputy Director of the Public Works Department, the day before yesterday. In addition to reporting on the recent sources and rice market trading situation, they also asked for ways to dredge the sources. According to a report by the New News Agency, the rumors that Wuhu, Changzhou, Wuxi and other places are obstructing the export of rice cannot be fully believed, but obstructions along the way are unavoidable. Yesterday, four or five ships from the rice market at the lower Nanbang port arrived, and more than 2,000 bags were loaded by carriage from Ba and Fengjing and other gangs. Fortunately, the new rice season is approaching, and Dongxin japonica rice will be fully available in early next month. Although the rice stored in Shanghai has decreased compared with before, the rice purchased by citizens has increased. Although it is impossible to investigate, it is estimated that there are at least four to five hundred thousand bags, which can regulate the market until September and October without any problems.

### Unified Government Bonds' Discount and Pledge Are Ready; Central Bank Branches Are Waiting for Implementation; Headquarters Orders Should Arrive in Shanghai by the End of the Month

After the Ministry of Finance announced the payment method for the principal and interest of domestic and foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties, the customs revenue in the occupied areas was intercepted. The four banks of China, Central, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank had no choice but to temporarily suspend the payment of the principal and interest of each debt. In order to stabilize the market, the four banks will discount and pledge the first repayment of principal and interest of the unified government bonds due at the end of July. The Chongqing headquarters will pay the full amount at one time, and the Shanghai and other port branches will pay it off in six installments. The Shanghai Central Bank branch has fully printed the discount vouchers and installment pledge payment schedule, and all preparations have been completed. As soon as the official headquarters order arrives in Shanghai, the pledge payment will begin on July 31. It is decided that the relevant order will arrive in Shanghai before the 31st. According to a report by the New Life News Agency to the securities black market, the closing prices of the unified government bonds yesterday morning were 52 yuan for Type A, unchanged; 43.4 yuan for Type B, down 5 cents; 41.8 yuan for Type C, down 5.5 cents; 41 yuan for Type D, down 6 cents; and 41.35 yuan for Type E, down 5.5 cents.

### The Hankou US Consulate Asks About Going to Jiangxi

To Meet Reverend Hollen in Nanchang The Japanese Army Claims It Will Facilitate It

The North China Daily News said that a spokesman for the Japanese army claimed yesterday (the 26th) at a reception for journalists that the Japanese side would facilitate the Hankou US Consulate's visit to Nanchang to meet Reverend Hollen. A Japanese liaison officer visited US Consul General Gauss on Tuesday to discuss the matter and assured Gauss that preparations would be made to facilitate the trip.

### Five People Arrested in Recent Days

On the 26th, Yu Guoying, Sun Mingjia, Ying Baolin, and Chen Xiaodi were arrested in Yunnan Road in the Public Concession and Beile Road and Fululi Road in the French Concession on suspicion of something. Then, at 11:11 a.m. yesterday, Gong Boqi (32 years old), a resident of Jiangsu Province living in Room 33 of the Dongchang Hotel at No. 5 Wufeng Lane, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, was arrested. At that time, special agents of the Japanese side, together with personnel from the Public Concession and French Concession police departments, went there. However, the Japanese side pointed out that the guests in that room were related to the guerrillas, but the police officers searched inside and found no relevant evidence. It was found that Gong lived in that room on the 23rd of this month and lived there with his wife and children.

### Dense Gunfire Near the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway

According to transportation industry sources, dense gunfire occurred in the western district of Shanghai at about 7 am yesterday. It is rumored that a battle occurred near the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway. The main land routes in western Shanghai, such as Hongqiao Daxi Road, are heavily guarded, and there are very few people coming and going. The public buses between Shanghai and Qingpu have stopped, and the defense at the Beixin Jing ferry is even stricter. All ships and pedestrians are subject to strict inspection. Although the ferry has resumed, there are few passengers.

### The Public Works Department Responds to Foreigners' Questions All Issues Are Handled Properly Traffic Incidents Are Also Resolved at Meetings

During the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Public Concession this spring, some taxpayers raised several questions. At that time, the Director-General of the Public Works Department replied that the issues raised would be investigated by the Bureau.

Improvements in Traffic Will Be Announced Separately

Among the issues raised, some were related to traffic. These matters, as well as some other traffic issues, were submitted to the Police Committee of the Public Works Department for discussion at a meeting on the 20th of this month. All the motions at this meeting were about traffic matters. As a result of the discussion, the Bureau will issue a separate announcement soon. The Issue of Remuneration for British Agents

Another issue raised by the taxpayers was about the remuneration of the Public Works Department's agents in London. This remuneration is calculated in British gold, so it naturally increases a lot when converted into national currency. The ability to reduce the remuneration required by the Public Works Department's agents in London for performing several important tasks for the Bureau has been considered by the Bureau's Finance Committee. This issue is still under discussion by the Committee.

Publication and Distribution of Official Gazette Will Be Announced Soon

The issue of printing and distributing the Public Works Department's Official Gazette has been submitted to a special sub-committee of the Finance Committee for discussion. Its report has been approved by the Board of Directors and will soon be announced to the press. The Amount of Old-Age Pensions Has Been Revised

A taxpayer once questioned why the amount of retirement pensions for retired employees listed in the Public Works Department's budget for this year, when converted into national currency, was less than in previous years. Regarding this issue, the former Director of the Public Works Department submitted a report to the Finance Committee stating that there were some errors in the previous years' pension budgets, namely that the amount of national currency was converted at a fixed exchange rate of one yuan of national currency to one shilling, two pence, and three-eighths of a penny of British gold, instead of the fixed exchange rate of one tael of silver to two shillings and six pence of British gold stipulated in Article 7 of the pension custody agreement. The pension amount table for this year has been revised to comply with the provisions of the custody agreement. As a result, the amount of British gold listed this year, when converted into national currency, is less than in previous years. However, the item for exchange subsidies in the general expenses category has increased. The Director also said that the revision of Article 7 of the custody agreement and the change in the above-mentioned exchange rate (that is, replacing the exchange rate of one tael of silver to two shillings and six pence of British gold with the exchange rate of one yuan of national currency to one shilling, two pence, and three-eighths of a penny of British gold) increased the pension fund by about 300,000 yuan. This expenditure was not included in the original budget. The Director then suggested to the Finance Committee that all pensions calculated in British gold should be marked in future pension budgets as having been converted according to the provisions of the custody agreement at the exchange rate of one tael of silver to two shillings and six pence of British gold. This suggestion has been accepted by the Finance Committee. The Situation in the Western District Has Been Publicly Announced

During the taxpayer's annual meeting, questions were also raised about the situation in the area of roads outside the boundary of the Western District. On May 5 of this year, the Public Works Department issued a public notice, which has been published in various newspapers and will not be repeated here.

### The Pseudo "Municipal Government" Detains Garbage Trucks; The Purpose Is to Coerce; It Wants to Discuss It Together with Other Issues; Fifteen Trucks Have Not Yet Been Returned; Loss Relates the Experience of Being Mistreated

The Mainland News reported that Ross and his party from the Public Works Department of the Public Works Department were forcibly taken to Jiangwan by personnel of "Dadao" on Sunday and stayed in a dirty place for 46 hours with a shortage of food and guarded by armed police. After the British Consulate General and the Public Works Department made strong protests, the people have been released yesterday (the 26th). However, the Public Works Department and private trucks worth at least 500,000 yuan are still under the "arrest" of the "Shanghai Special Municipal Government". Among them, the value of 15 new American trucks purchased by the Public Works Department is equal to the amount of arrears that "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an demanded from the Public Works Department for the right to dump garbage in Zhabei. According to Jimson, Director of the Public Works Department yesterday,

Fu's agency is particularly difficult to deal with. It was heard a few weeks ago that the French Concession authorities had difficulty dumping garbage, so the Public Works Department began negotiations with Chuan. However, the "Dadao" personnel wanted to discuss this matter together with other issues so that they could be satisfied and solve the matter. However, they are dealing with the entire event without any good reason, according to him. Acting British Consul General Gibson said yesterday morning that since the people had been released at 9:30, he would not

pursue the protest. According to Ross's statement to reporters yesterday about his detention in Jiangwan, at 2:30 pm on Sunday, he and his party of more than 100 people were dumping garbage from the Public Concession near the 63 Huayuan. A Japanese plane began to circle above. Just as he was suspicious, 30 "Dadao" police officers and an armed Japanese officer arrived in a car, approached with guns, and forced the people to return to the trucks without explanation, saying that they had to go to Jiangwan. At that time,

most of the garbage in the car had not been dumped. When the car crossed the railway line and entered the Concession road, Ross went to the car to discuss with two Japanese Marine Corps sentries, but there was no result. Suddenly, a "Dadao" policeman pushed him back into the truck. Before Hongkou Park, he saw an Indian police officer. Ross jumped out of the car and left a note on the Indian police officer's notebook, then returned to the car. He finally arrived in the city center. After a while, the Chinese workers were forbidden in one room, and Ross, the German Brute, the Russian, and a Chinese supervisor were taken into a smelly room.

Saliva was all over the floor, and six armed police officers were wandering outside the room. An hour later, a senior "Dadao" police officer named Yao ordered three eggs and two plates of vegetables to be sent into the room. At 8:30 pm, he brought four bottles of beer for the people and sent in three dirty, smelly beds, coupled with harassing mosquitoes, they could not sleep peacefully. At 1:30 pm, a Japanese military officer, probably an advisor to "Mayor" Chuan, entered the room and told

the people to dress and prepare to be released. A few minutes later, the Japanese returned to the room and said that because of a guerrilla attack, a curfew had been declared and they would not be released until morning. At about 4 o'clock, the people left the room to get some fresh air. At about 7 o'clock, "Municipal Government" personnel began to arrive, and the people were forbidden in the room all day. At 11:30 am, Ross managed to call the Public Works Department to report the details of the detention and requested that a police car be sent

Food arrived Yao heard the news and ordered people to send in four breads and some milk. Ross told him that he was waiting for the food from the Concession to arrive. Yao sent someone to take back the beer and some dishes as soon as possible by private car. When the two Japanese personnel of the police department arrived with food, Yao asked Ross and others not to accept it, but Ross and others turned a deaf ear. During the detention, the Chinese workers only ate coarse rice, while Ross paid 6 yuan for each meal, and the Chinese workers only had

a little vegetables to fill their stomachs. On Tuesday night, Ross and others got new beds and clean bedding, and were able to sleep. Yesterday morning, they ate the remaining food sent by the Concession. The trucks were parked outside the room. Ross repeatedly asked to dump the smelly garbage in the car for hygiene reasons, but it was unsuccessful. At 11:00 am, Ross and others were released and left on

several moving trucks. They drove to Ditchville Road. One car was damaged and could not move. Ross ordered the party of 103 people to get off the car and go to the Ditchville Road police station, and then returned to the Public Concession to report the details to the Public Works Department.

### Hongqiao District in Western Shanghai: Chinese Guerrilla Forces Bolstered, Numbering at Least One Thousand, Not Disturbing Foreign Nationals, Foreign Nationals Even Aiding Guerrilla Forces with Funds—Japanese Army's Inability to Control the Area Clearly Proven—

According to the Continental Daily News, foreigners residing outside the Shanghai Western District concession have received letters in recent weeks, or have had well-dressed Chinese individuals, accompanied by their fifteen-year-old sons, call at their door to request several yuan in funding to assist the Chinese guerrilla forces in the Hongqiao area and to guarantee one year of protection. Foreign nationals in Hongqiao are currently unsure whether these requests are genuine or deceptive. Some believe that the funds are indeed

used to assist the guerrilla forces. According to a foreign national in Hongqiao, speaking to a reporter yesterday (the 26th), they contribute two yuan each month, handed over to the Chinese individual collecting the money. They believe that this money does indeed reach the hands of the guerrilla forces. Although the Japanese army nominally controls the area, only a few Japanese soldiers are seen in daylight, and only a small number of patrolling Japanese soldiers appear at night, often triggering gunfire. Foreign nationals are aware that there are guerrilla forces in the area. Logically, this money must

reach the hands of the guerrilla forces. Other foreign nationals in Hongqiao have said the same. In summary, their statements demonstrate that the Japanese army only nominally controls the area. They also state that, whether the funds are being fraudulently obtained in the name of guerrilla forces, or whether the money is indeed reaching the hands of the guerrilla forces, both reflect the Japanese army's lack of control. It is estimated that there are currently at least one thousand guerrilla fighters active

in the Western Shanghai area. They do not disturb foreign nationals. Gunfire is almost certain to occur at night, either for a short time or continuously for two or three hours. The frequency of gunfire is a fact.

### Zhenhai County Government Carefully Issues Exit Permits

Shanghai-Ningbo Line Foreign Vessels' Whereabouts Mysterious; Arriving at Wenzhou, Unable to Enter

The Zhenhai County Government, due to the increasing number of people going to the county to obtain permits, has formulated the following measures to ensure caution and facilitate issuance: 1. Regardless of gender or age, everyone must provide two 2.5-inch head-and-shoulders photos, along with their identity card, and submit them to the government for verification. 2. Starting from the 22nd of this month, applications will be received and issued in the morning and afternoon, respectively. Only receiving in the morning, not issuing; only issuing in the afternoon, not receiving. Application forms, documents, and photos received on this morning will be issued with a pass at 3 PM on the next afternoon. 3. The elderly and young may have someone submit their application forms and photos on their behalf if the journey is too far, but the pass must be collected in person for verification and issuance. Proxy collection is not allowed. 4. Those who have paid off their field taxes and voluntary defense contributions must still present the receipts for verification when collecting the permit. If field taxes and voluntary defense contributions have not been paid, they should be paid first. 5. The written guarantee deposit should be submitted to the local district office, or office, or police station by the guaranteed person with the completed guarantee letter in advance, and the responsible head officer should be responsible for checking the guarantee and signing and sealing (using a private seal) and then submitting it to the government together with the application form and two 2.5-inch head-and-shoulders photos for verification and issuance of the pass. In addition, if any township has not sent the allotted conscripted laborers since June, that township shall not arbitrarily issue applications, and the county government's exit passes shall also be temporarily withheld until the quota has been conscripted in full, in accordance with the regulations, to emphasize military service and benefit the war of resistance.

Shanghai-Ningbo Line

After the authorities approved the continued sailing of foreign vessels on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, they were to anchor at the mouth of Zhenhai, outside the sealed line, and passengers and cargo were to be transferred by barge. This information was reported in previous issues. It is now known that the Moller Line's Moufuk (謀福)  Wheel departed from Shanghai to Ningbo this morning. The Yihua Line's Baoli Wheel (寶利輪) has been approved by the authorities to join the Shanghai-Ningbo line, and was originally scheduled to sail this morning. Due to passenger and cargo procedures not being completed in time, it has been rescheduled to sail to Ningbo at 3 AM tomorrow morning. The Moller Line's Haifuk Wheel (海福輸) also intends to sail on the Shanghai-Ningbo line and is currently applying. Once approved, the sailing date will be set. The Far Eastern Company's Hanna Wheel (哈納輪) decided to sail to Ningbo twice. It was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai last night, but the cargo had not yet been loaded. The company said that it would return to Shanghai on the 29th (Saturday) and continue sailing to Zhenhai on the morning of the 30th. The Sino-Italian Company's Deping Wheel (德平輪), which sailed to Ningbo at the same time as the Hanna Wheel and arrived in Zhenhai at the same time, will not be able to return to Shanghai until next Monday because the ship is larger and carries more cargo.

Shanghai-Wenzhou Line

The Jardine Matheson's Shenyuan Wheel (神元輪), which left Shanghai directly for Wenzhou on the 25th. According to a telegram received by the company from the ship, it arrived outside the mouth of Wenzhou at around 5 PM on the 26th. Because the port was sealed, it could not enter. It is unknown whether it will return to Shanghai or change its route.

### British Tax Collectors Temporarily Detained in Western Shanghai: Puppet Regime Denies the Municipal Council's Right to Collect Taxes; Two British Nationals Detained for Five Hours

According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, on Tuesday afternoon and evening, while the staff of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Works Department, including Mr. Ross, were still being detained by the "Great Way Municipal Government" in the city center and had not been released, two British tax collectors from the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Frazer and Mr. Griffiths, were detained for five hours in the "badlands" area of Western Shanghai by the "Great Way" police. It began shortly after 2 PM when the two were collecting taxes at No. 95 Yidingpan Road in the "badlands" area. At 2:15 PM, a group of "Great Way" police approached the two and politely asked them to accompany them to the police station at the end of the alley. The two had no choice but to comply. An hour later, Mr. Frazer and Mr. Griffiths' official car was allowed to return, and the driver was told to report the detention. Upon hearing the news, police officers from the Jing'an Temple police station went to consult with a Japanese consultant from the "Great Way Municipal Government" in the Western District. At 7:15 PM, the two British nationals were released. The reason for the detention was that the "Great Way" authorities did not recognize the Shanghai Municipal Council's right to collect taxes in the alleys next to the roads outside the concession. According to Shanghai Municipal Council personnel speaking to reporters today (the 27th), the Shanghai Municipal Council believes that it should be compensated for providing services, as residents of the alley enjoy the public convenience of using the roads leading to the concession.

### Dual Organization Discovered in Local Privately-Run Radio Stations

The privately-run Chinese radio stations in this city originally had an organization called the Shanghai Broadcasting Industry Association, for the purpose of mutual contact and business development. Since the August 13th Incident, the Japanese side established the "Shanghai Broadcasting Wireless Supervision Office" in Shanghai, stipulating that all newly established radio stations must first obtain permission from the office, otherwise they would be banned. Before the war, there were more than 30 Chinese radio stations in this city. After the war, some voluntarily ceased operations, but several new radio stations were also established. Therefore, the number of radio stations is currently about the same as before the war, and they all operate by broadcasting commercial programs. It is now heard that, under the guidance of the "Supervision Office," a so-called "Shanghai Private Radio Station Association" has been established, and it is learned that the association held its inaugural meeting on the 22nd of this month. Thus, a dual organization has also emerged in the privately-run radio station industry in this city.

### Hurricanes Active in the Pacific Ocean

Two New Typhoons Arise; Movement Still Unclear

Hurricanes have arisen in the Pacific Ocean one after another, which is rare in previous years, because the active season for hurricanes usually starts in the autumn. According to a Reuters reporter, this morning they learned from the Xujiahui Observatory that there are currently two hurricanes rising in the Pacific Ocean. The first hurricane had already reached 29 degrees north latitude and 123 degrees east longitude at 6 AM this morning, heading due west. Although Shanghai will not be attacked by this hurricane, the climate has been somewhat disturbed. Therefore, the sun appears and disappears intermittently in this city, and there are occasional rain showers. The second hurricane has just begun. At 6 AM this morning, it reached 22 degrees north latitude and 134 degrees east longitude, heading northwest. It is still unclear whether Shanghai will be affected by it. As for the hurricane that arose in the Pacific Ocean on the 24th of this month, it landed and dissipated after reaching 29 degrees north latitude and 120 degrees east longitude, near Wenzhou and Ningbo.

### Japanese Troops in Changshu Repeatedly Attacked

On the 24th of this month, the guerrilla unit led by Zong Bolian, which is active in the Xihu (錫滬) Highway area of Changshu, has been trained and equipped since being assigned by the Eastern War Zone military authorities. On the night of the 24th, at about 8 PM, he led more than 80 team members to sneak into the Changshu section of the Xihu Highway. The highway is used by the Japanese army as an important military transportation route. The guerrillas have been constantly carrying out sabotage on the road in recent weeks. The Japanese army repairs it and then it is broken again, unable to maintain it. They dispatched more than 200 Japanese soldiers to patrol and guard the Baimao Gu area of the road all day long, but the guerrillas appear and disappear unpredictably, and the Japanese army cannot stop them. Therefore, at about 5 AM on the 25th, they attacked and destroyed four military vehicles and one commercial vehicle from Shanghai to Wuxi near the No. 62 Foreign Bridge, killing more than 50 Japanese soldiers and seizing 374 new-style rifles, 21 Type 38 light machine guns, two steel cannons, 126 boxes of ammunition, eight Lee-Enfield rifles, nine pistols worn by the killed Japanese soldiers, 13 Mauser pistols, and two revolvers (six-inch and eight-inch). During the attack, the Japanese army fought back in panic in the east, and were swept by light machine guns. Eleven team members and two squad leaders were also killed. Although the guerrillas also suffered some casualties, their morale was extremely high.

### Qian Industry Clearing Houses Report on Drawing Funds; More Than 30 Reports Received, Only a Few Not Reported; More Than 10 Million Needed for Clearing, Collateral Valued at 70%

The new clearing system to be implemented by the money industry, with the money industry's 10 million yuan fund for drawing, and the amount of position that each bank plans to draw, has been reported to the association. It is estimated that the 10 million yuan amount for the entire industry will exceed the assumed amount. The details are as follows:

Drawing Positions: Banks Report Completion

There are 41 members of the money industry, both north and south. Since the association announced on the 25th of this month to consult with each bank on the amount of new clearing funds needed, and limited the time to report within two days from the date of the announcement in order to calculate, the managers of each bank immediately summoned the assistant managers and the people in charge of the business department to carefully discuss the total amount of clearing funds needed for business, and then prepared a report and sent it to the association within the day before yesterday, confirming the amount of position for the assumed amount of clearing to be drawn. The association did not receive many reports from members the day before yesterday. As of yesterday afternoon, the association had received reports from as many as 36 or 37 banks. It is expected that the remaining few banks' reports will be completed this morning.

Need for Clearing Exceeds 10 Million

The money industry assumed that the total amount of new clearing funds to be drawn by the money industry would be 10 million yuan. The association was responsible for announcing to each bank to estimate the amount of clearing funds needed for business. It was rumored in advance that the allocation of funds in the industry would not be enough to reach 10 million yuan. Yesterday, according to the industry spokesperson, the recent business of each clearing bank has been prosperous. Although there are a large number of reserves, the amount of clearing funds to be drawn is also extremely necessary for business. It is found that this amount is only an assumed amount. It is estimated that the total amount of clearing funds to be drawn reported by the association has already exceeded 10 million yuan. In the future, after the new banknotes are implemented, if each bank has a surplus in the amount it has subscribed for, it can also be dismantled among the industry. As for the limit of collateral, whether it is a title deed, securities, jewelry, etc., it will be valued at 70%.

### Disabled and Old People's Home Formulates Admission Methods

The Shanghai Disabled and Old People's Home, jointly organized by the entertainment industry, etc., has started to take in people after the board of directors of the home elected Zhu Qizhen, Zhang Yichen, and Zhang Ye'er as chairmen, and Ye Nianqu, Quan Baoqing, and Liu Ziyun as directors. The methods are as follows: (1) The home will take in a maximum of 100 disabled people and 50 elderly people (the elderly must belong to the entertainment industry). (2) Disabled people and helpless elderly people must have an introducer report their name, age, native place, family situation, and the reason for the disability to the home. After the home verifies the information and there is room, it will notify the introducer to fill out a guarantee letter and send it to the home for admission.

### Large Gang of Bandits on Trial for Murder, Kidnapping, and Robbery; Defendants Confess to Numerous Crimes

The bandits Yang Shunkang, Ming Shanxiang, Chen Yuansheng, Jiang Liansheng, Zhang Shaole, Wang Zhongshi, Sun Yaowu, Li Youtai, Chuan Kaihua, and dozens of others, from May 2nd to December 2nd of this year, continuously committed more than 17 cases of kidnapping, robbery, and attempted murder in the Public Concession and the road extension areas of Western Shanghai. Recently, the Public Concession's various police stations collaborated to arrest 29 male and female bandits in Wugong, Daxin, Dongfang, and Dachunghua hotels, and in the shacks on Lou Lang Road, and seized military weapons such as handguns, Mauser pistols, and hand grenades, which were brought to the police station for investigation. Yesterday, they were transferred to the First Special Court's Criminal Division. The defendant Yang Shunkang and Ming Shanxiang were prosecuted for attempted murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code. The defendants Chen Yuansheng, Jiang Liansheng, Zhang Shaole, Wang Zhongbao, Sun Yaowu, Gao Yunwen, Li Youtai, Chuan Kaihua, and Yang Shunkang were prosecuted for robbery under Article 330 of the Criminal Code. The defendant Yang Shunkang was prosecuted for endangering public safety under Article 186 of the Criminal Code. Jiang Liansheng, Sun Yaowu, Zhang Shaole, and Li Youtai were prosecuted for preparing to commit kidnapping for ransom under Article 347, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code. Attorney Li Zhishan represented the police station and described the process of solving the case and the criminal facts of each defendant, stating that at 3:35 PM on the 2nd of this month, Western Police No. 83, Chinese Police No. 2989, and Chinese Police No. 2864 dispatched by the Jing'an Temple Police Station were patrolling and searching pedestrians in their jurisdiction. Unexpectedly, the defendants Yang Shunkang and Ming Shanxiang opened fire on the Chinese and Western police at Yidingpan Road, attempting to murder them. The defendants Chen Yuansheng and Zhang Shaole repeatedly committed theft in the concession. Jiang Liansheng, etc.

attempted to kidnap Zhou Baoqing's three-year-old son. All of these acts were confessed to at the police station. However, among the 29 defendants, some committed several crimes, and the most serious ones were prosecuted, while the minor ones were not prosecuted in accordance with Article 233 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Judge Jiang then interrogated each defendant based on the charges. According to the defendant Yang Shunkang's confession, he was a bodyguard at a mansion at No. 6, Lane 95, Yidingpan Road. At 3:35 PM on the 2nd of this month, he and Ming Shanxiang did open fire on the Chinese and Western police. Afterwards, he handed the gun over to Xu Xiongfei. All actions were in accordance

with the orders of the bodyguard captain Xu Wenan. Ming Shanxiang's confession was similar to Yang's. Chen Yuansheng, Li Youtai, Jiang Liansheng, Sun Yaowu, and others confessed to the thefts they committed. However, Chen Yuansheng's sister, Xiang Chen, repeatedly cried out for injustice. The court heard the case from 2 PM to about 5:30 PM. Several witnesses also identified each defendant. Afterwards, police attorney Li and the defense attorneys of the defendants Sun Yaowu and Zhang Shaole, Fan Gang and Zhang Danping, exchanged opinions.

### Rickshaw Parts Prices Increase; Rickshaw Owners Plan to Request Rent Increase

Due to the tightening of foreign exchange and the increased prices of metal and rickshaw parts, the cost of rickshaws has increased by one-half. Outer tires sold for 19 yuan last month, and now sell for 25 yuan. Inner tires previously sold for 3 yuan, and now sell for 4.5 yuan. Other items such as paint, tarpaulin, and steel wire have also increased across the board. Therefore, the cost per rickshaw, which was 98 yuan in June, has now increased to more than 140 yuan. The rickshaw industry is unable to increase rickshaw rentals due to the restrictions imposed by the Municipal Council. Therefore, at 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a general meeting of rickshaw owner representatives was held to ask the director and deputy director generals to be responsible for negotiating, and requested to discuss and resolve the issue based on the reasons for the price increases of trams, rental cars, public buses, and other industries.

### Inciting Abduction; Temple Monk Sued for Receiving Stolen Goods; Each Side Held Their Own Grounds During Yesterday's Trial; Court Ordered to Wait for Verdict

Yang Yunwu, from Gaoyou, who had served as a county magistrate in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, and other provinces, fled with his family after the "August 13th" Incident and resided at the Leshan Temple on Jin Shenfu Road for more than a year. He has now moved to No. 3, Lane 44, Raul Dong Road. His concubine, Sun Lanzhen, absconded with cash and jewelry worth about 6,000 to 7,000 yuan on May 18th of this year. Yang believed that Sun had an ambiguous relationship with Wan Yuan, a former monk at the Leshan Temple (31 years old this year, secular name Tong Changyao). The monk was significantly involved in this absconding. Therefore, at the beginning of this month, he reported to the French Concession Police Station, ordering detectives to arrest the monk Wan and confiscate stolen goods such as embroidered pillowcases. The police station received instructions to detain the monk for investigation. This has been reported in the newspapers many times. The French police yesterday transferred the monk Wan Yuan to the Criminal Division 8 of the Second Special Court, charging him with receiving bribes. Judge Qiu then took the seat and interrogated him. The plaintiff, Yang Yunwu, insisted that his concubine Sun Lanzhen ran away because she was instigated by the defendant monk Wan Yuan, and that the stolen jewelry was also under the defendant's control. The embroidered pillowcase confiscated from the defendant's residence was undoubtedly made by the plaintiff's own daughter, stolen by Sun Lanzhen, and hidden in the defendant's residence. The court then interrogated the defendant based on this, but he flatly denied it. According to the testimony of witnesses Zhang Youfa, Zhu Wanzhang, and others, Sun Lanzhen and the defendant had a very close relationship. The court then ordered that arguments be made and announced the end of the trial, with the verdict scheduled for the 1st of next month.

### Qianzhuang Employee Embezzles Funds and Flees, Indulging in Prostitution and Pleasure, and Agrees with a Friend to Run Usury Business; Extreme Joy Leads to Sorrow, Finally Arrested

The Rixin Qianzhuang at No. 9, Fuan Suili, Tianjin Road, was opened by Hu Houfu from Yuyao. At about 11 AM on the 11th of this month, Hu ordered his partner, Kong Guangfu (also known as A Xing, 22 years old), to exchange two clearing bills, with a face value of 4,368 yuan, for 4,000 yuan in cash at the Hangzhou Line No. 48, Jixiang Street. Kong then

fled with the cash. That night, he went to various brothels in the French Concession to have fun. Then, he went to Oriental and Continental hotels and other hotels to solicit prostitutes. In one night, he solicited ten prostitutes to accompany him, spending 150 gold. At the same time, he bought clothes extravagantly. Guan Depei, a Yangzhou native who lived at No. 50 Ximenli, Ximen Road, and Kong met

in the amusement park. After Kong obtained the huge sum of money, he invested 2,000 yuan and rented a room on the upper floor of No. 1 Fushouli, Allegre Road, with Guan to run a usury business. Although Kong was so carefree and happy, the Jiu Xin Zhuang reported to the police station after the incident, and detectives searched everywhere. At 6 AM the day before yesterday, the chief patrol officer Gao Zhen and detective Wang Qi from the General Patrol Police Station

arrested Kong in Room 365, Dajiangnan Hotel, No. 410 Fujian Road, and confiscated 900 yuan of stolen money. Guan Depei was also arrested and 300 yuan of stolen money was also confiscated. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to Criminal Division 1 of the First Special Court. Police Attorney Ru Baoyi explained the process and requested permission for a retrial at a later date because further investigation was needed. The Rixin Zhuang also commissioned Attorney Jiang Chiping to appear in court and filed a civil suit, requesting that the stolen money be returned first. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, it was ordered that the retrial be held one week later and that the stolen money be returned to the owner first.

### Romantic Thief Jiang Jianqiu Sentenced to Nine Years

The romantic thief Jiang Jianqiu has committed dozens of cases of fraud, theft, and robbery in the two concessions in recent months. Most of the victims are prostitutes, guides, dancers, concubines, and female actors. In May of this year, Jiang was arrested by the Public Concession Police Station and transferred to the First Special Court. He was tried and sentenced to three years imprisonment for repeated theft and three years imprisonment for fraud, to be served concurrently for five years. The French Concession Police Station brought Jiang to justice because Jiang had committed ten cases of fraud and theft and five cases of robbery in the concession. Jiang's confession involved Kunqu actress Mao Jianqiu, Yu Guifen, Yao Yuchan, and wealthy concubine Jin, etc. When Mao Jianqiu appeared in court to confront Jiang, Jiang claimed that he did not know Mao Jianqiu. Yu Guifen and others did not appear in court. The case was concluded by Judge Qiu Huan Ying of the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Yesterday morning, he took the seat in Criminal Division 8 and ordered the defendant to be brought to court to announce the verdict. The main text of the judgment stated that Jiang Jianqiu, a repeat offender of robbery, was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment. The charges of fraud and theft were dismissed. It is heard that Jiang did not accept the judgment and will appeal to the Higher Branch Court for a reduction in sentence.

### Letters to the Editor

Having read the Shanghai West news in the third section of your newspaper on the 24th of this month, which stated that the bandit troop of Xu Leisheng was disarmed and resolved, it is not in accordance with the facts. After Zhisheng withdrew from the Guojun West, he was motivated by his enthusiasm for loving the car, organized troops, engaged in guerrilla warfare, disturbed the enemy's rear, was formally incorporated by Shangfeng early on, and appointed to positions. He is by no means comparable to the so-called bandits. Late at night on the 18th of this month, a team of unknown origin did contact bandits to attack the department. Fortunately, the officials and soldiers were unanimously committed to their lives. Therefore, although slightly damaged, it is not difficult to immediately restore the original state. In addition to reporting the details to Shangfeng for instructions and review, I am sending another letter to your newspaper for correction, so as not to confuse the hearing and cause public and private feelings. Respectfully to the Editor-in-Chief of Shen Bao, Xu Leisheng, July 27,
Respectfully, Having read the news item "Charity Lottery Continues to Be Issued" in today's newspaper's local news column, the fact that it was undertaken by our company is true, but there is no person named Ma among our company's shareholders. Moreover, the statement "It is also heard that he has been permitted by a certain party to promote sales in various guerrilla areas, so the confirmed sales amount is still 150,000 yuan" is not only fundamentally unfounded but also damages our company's reputation. Our company's undertaking of the lottery is purely driven by charitable concepts, and there is no intention to profit. How could we dare to do such a frivolous act? It is obvious that others are creating rumors and slandering us. It is hoped that a correction will be made. Respectfully to Shen Bao, Fengxing Company, July 27.
Respectfully, Having read the news item in your newspaper "Pinghu Steamer Attacked by Chinese Troops for Transporting Japanese Supplies," it is not in accordance with the facts. The Shanghai-Pinghu route sailed by our company used a steamer and towed one passenger ship and one cargo ship on the 23rd of this month, fully loaded with goods, heading to Pinghu. At around 6:00 PM that afternoon, when arriving at Xindai, it happened to meet troops passing through. They boarded the ship for inspection and found a transit permit on a passenger, which caused a misunderstanding. The ship was burned and five employees were detained. Our company is currently trying to rescue them. This is the actual situation. Please correct it to avoid misleading rumors. Respectfully to Shen Bao Taijian, Ping He Xing Ji Transportation Company, July 27.

Correction - Regarding the news item "Anti-British Conflict in Hongkou" published in this newspaper on the 25th of this month, after a thorough investigation by this newspaper's reporters, it has been learned that the news was indeed a misreport. We hereby make a correction.

### On Sorrows, Hatreds, Flowers, and the Moon

— Chiqiang

Looking through old poetry, there are sorrows and hatreds.

New poetry should have saved us from these old ailments, but that is not entirely the case. There are sorrows and hatreds; without hatred, there is no sorrow.

Some say that poets have a different heart. They hate old things, hate them thoroughly, and add new sorrows on top of old ones.

Have you ever weighed how much these sorrows and hatreds weigh? As Li Qingzhao said, "Old hatreds and new sorrows, the Double Creek dragonfly boat cannot bear!"

Double Creek is in my hometown. Dragonfly boats are probably just like those, but not that small. Their carrying capacity and draft are still okay. However, it is said that our poets' sorrows and hatreds cannot be borne. The weight can be imagined!

Sick sorrows and sick hatreds spread across the Chinese poetry and literary scene before an appropriate vaccine was found. If you don't believe it, try humming; those who let you hum will be sure to fall into a city of sorrow and also fall into a sea of hatred. If you want to reach the other shore, to be famous, you must fill the sea of hatred with all the old hatred, "Fill the sea with water until it is dry," isn't it? Embrace all the new sorrows into the city of sorrow, "Retreat from the city of sorrow, ten thousand miles are reduced," isn't it?

Writing poems and composing lyrics is not difficult. What is difficult is to be sorrowful without rules, to hate without enough heat. Your great work is good! Not only empty and without substance, but also unbearably vulgar; to put it expertly, it lacks elegance.

However, without wind there is no elegance, and with wind, flowers bloom and fall. Blooming is natural, "There is a beauty!" Falling petals are, of course, falling. Alas! Pity! Pity! Defects, defects! Immediately, a fever develops. "The crescent moon shines on Kyushu, a few families are happy, a few families are sad"; so, you get angry looking at the moon, from "The moon rises above the willow" until the moon sets and the crow cries. This is called: "Since ancient times, those who have made the moon a source of sorrow, the sorrow will cease when the moon is pushed down."

The moon existed in ancient times, it exists in modern times, and it will continue to be bright in the future. And flowers bloom every year today, and wither tomorrow. Sorrows are endless, and there is hatred within hatred, layers upon layers, new and old, taking up a large page of literature and art.

The "de ma ne ya" sounds are harmless; new poems warm old hatreds, the shadow of the moon on the flowers dappled on the corners of our ancestors' walls, is especially bright tonight, alas! There is no way out, are you still learning to add sorrow and hatred, reaching for the moon and climbing for flowers?

I have nothing more to say. I will copy a poem by Xin Jiaxuan to counter the poison and use it to end the discussion:

When young, I did not know the taste of sorrow, loved to climb the tower, loved to climb the tower, forced to speak of sorrow for new words. Now I know the taste of sorrow, want to speak but stop, want to speak but stop, but say the weather is cool, a good autumn.

A good "The weather is cool, a good autumn"!

Central Plains is disturbed, it is truly a time of national crisis.

### The Book of Truth (Part 2)

— Mala

"So everyone rushed to that mountain, opened the book of truth, and recited the sentences in the book in loud tones. Their voices resounded to every corner of the world, telling people that it was possible to live without those oppressors, and that they would certainly be happier and more free. Thus the whole world was enveloped in turmoil and unrest. Terror threatened all nations, and of course the nations with the most oppression were the most afraid. In an attempt to struggle against their ultimate fate, they incited a scruffy officer who had been kicked aside by the people to commit even greater massacres on their behalf."

"This massacre was truly unprecedented. Even the people had not suffered such a fate in the days of the Inquisition and Rivera. They wanted to wipe out the people's heroic struggle in a massacre. They were like a band of crazed magicians. Wherever these magicians passed, bustling cities became ruins. Destruction, death, the innocent blood of peaceful people flowed across the land of this country. Corpses piled up like mountains in the mountain valleys, on the roadsides, and in the villages. The loud voices weakened and finally suffocated in their own blood. Everything was the victory of power." My father said in grief, as if waking up from a long dream. He wanted to take a puff of his pipe, but it was extinguished. He added resolutely: "My story ends like this."

"It shouldn't end like this," I said loudly, suppressing my grief. My heart was twisted by it.

"Yes, my child, the victory of violence is only an illusion. I can tell you for sure that the third tragedy is still being prepared. We must believe in the future," my father said calmly and firmly.

Wanting to calm my heart, I turned my head away, wanting to forget the sad ending of the story filled with deep despair. In the distance, on the horizon, I suddenly discovered a few sparse stars shining like golden buttons. The moon also peeked out from the clouds, pouring clear moonlight into the forest, and a few colorful clouds floated slowly beside it.

"Father, there are stars over there," I exclaimed with joy, pointing at them.

"Yes, I see them. I always feel that light is everywhere. Even my story still implies great hope, still shining future light and warmth," my father said forgetfully, stirring his rich, springy hair.

"It's getting cool, let's go to sleep." My father's excitement had subsided.

That night I had a dream in which the whole panorama of the great tragedy of the people of that country fighting for freedom and happiness unfolded.

I dedicate this article to Mr. Gan, who knows Spain best. He warmed my heart during my days of doubt and depravity, giving me new energy to continue living. I wish him good health from afar.

### The Sigh of the Earth

— Wenku

It was a time long past. The earth was still growing happily. At that time, it was simple, yet it had a primal beauty.

In its youth, the undulating mountains, winding rivers, boundless seas, vast plains, lush trees, colorful flowers, giant beasts, clever birds, chirping insects... adorned it in a very pure way.

At that time, it had the tenderness of a virgin, like a flower bud, and was filled with infinite vitality throughout the universe.

The earth grew quietly in peaceful days, without loneliness. When all living things came to the end of their lives in old age, new beauties immediately replaced them. There was never any decline, nor any lack.

Gradually, the earth evolved, and intelligent humans were multiplying. This made it even more excited. It entrusted its entire life to mankind, who would exhaust their rich brains, use their strong limbs, dig up underground treasures, and develop barren land, to adorn the earth with splendor and beauty.

But the souls of these humans had great disparities: loyal, sincere... cunning, deceitful... Therefore, disputes, struggles... replaced their careers. They no longer worked hard to make the earth beautiful, to create a happy world!

They forgot that only the earth could sustain them. They did not know how to remedy things. The ashes of fire, the traces of bloodshed, the lethal weapons, the clumsy schemes... tainted the earth. The earth lost its innocence and its pure beauty. And those hideous demons and despicable ghosts used the lovely earth as their nests.

The slaughter of the violent, the intimidation of the mighty, the howling of ghosts, the weeping of the oppressed, destroyed all the beauty of the earth!

On earth, there was decline, chaos, gusts of wind, bursts of storms!

Mankind embarked on a path of destruction, and at the same time, they destroyed the beautiful earth!

The earth could not cry, nor could it be angry, but only sighed quietly. It sighed for mankind! At the same time, it sighed for its own fate!

It waited for mankind to wake up, hoping to drive away the ghosts wearing human-shaped masks, so that it could shine again with the brilliance of its youth.

But at present, it is still a sad sight.

Unceasingly, unceasingly, the earth is sighing.

### Inextricably Entangled!

### I Gaze at the Clouds and Trees in the Distant Sky

— Guo Nidi

I have returned from a city thirty miles away,

Where I spent my long months and years:

In the dusk, on the streets, by the beautifully decorated shop windows,

My lonely and desolate shadow often lingered.

Now, there are vexing winds and rains every day,

Listening to the sound of the wind sweeping past the treetops outside the window like a sea wave:

Let the sound of the rain gently knock on my closed door,

Having just arrived at my old home, everything feels strange and interesting,

I am originally as bland as a wild monk.

The monotonous music of the chirping insects no longer evokes joy,

My childhood companions have also gradually aged in the dust.

What is more, the stars here have also changed their colors:

I dare not go to the market,

Because I hate seeing all the strange things in the market.

Although I am uneasy with loneliness, I fear

That germs will slowly grow in my blood cells!

I need to breathe some of the moist air of the countryside,

The noise of the noisy carriages and horses is unbearable.

Oh, at this moment, I only hope that tomorrow will be sunny,

To wake up early and hear the cooing of the pigeons,

To spend some time on the tender yellow path after the rain.

Isn't it true, "Germs are more likely to age in the sunlight?"

Then I will gaze at the clouds and trees in the distant sky,

And my heart will fly to a place even further away.

Life and Death

One day, walking into the cemetery, my friend said, "I want to die." His eyes were fixed on the white cross, perhaps it was the goddess? In the past, my friend lived in an unfavorable environment, reading those books with the fragrance of death—they taught young people some strange ideas.

Hearing this, I said in surprise, "Lying here quietly, aren't you afraid of being lonely?"

"Look, aren't there so many companions?" He pointed to the tombs underground, widening his round eyes.

"But, this is a shameful escape!"

He was silent, his head drooping.

Indeed, "Life is like a burden, some pick it up, some cannot." Now, we are walking on a painful road again, a little tired maybe, but not to the point of falling down. Cheer up, switch shoulders, we still have to go on, we still have to live on.

"Death is not difficult, but we have to consider how to die. We should always have love and attachment to life."

Editor's Note: Wang Yin has always been known in the film industry for his "hard-line" style. He has been working hard for the Chinese film industry for nearly ten years. Recently, he started trying directing as an actor, and is currently filming "Desperate Fugitive." From this piece of writing, we can see that he is a thoughtful artist.

Since entering the film industry, it has been nearly ten years, and I am ashamed to say that in these long years, I have not seized the opportunities that so many people longed for to develop my ambitions; although I often played important roles that suited my personality, I have never contributed any better achievements to the audience, which is what I regret most.

My initial motivation for joining the film industry was half out of interest and half for the sake of life. There is no need to deny this. At that time—the early days of the rise of the Chinese film industry—many people thought that "making movies" was a novel and good profession. My family became increasingly difficult after my father lost his job, so I got the opportunity to enter this silver screen world. My heart was unusually active, and I was working hard with infinite excitement. At the same time, the outside world's enthusiasm for the film industry also engraved a strong belief in my heart: I am ready to use all my strength to create.

The birthplace of my life on the film set was China Southern Film Company. I remember that the first film was with the "late" Ms. Ye Juanjuan. I was only a supporting actor, playing an insignificant role in the film, a so-called "extra." My performance showed my clumsiness and rigidity everywhere. Fortunately, several colleagues in China Southern were able to guide me wholeheartedly and encourage me at any time. This allowed me to barely finish filming my role. Until the film was screened, I was both happy and apprehensive, but this after all laid the foundation for my nearly ten years of life as a filmmaker.

I muddled along in China Southern Company for two years, but only acted in two or three films. Later, thanks to the introduction of the famous photographer Mr. Hong Weilie, I entered Shanghai Film Company. At that time, because of the lack of actors in Shanghai Company, I was fortunate to be selected by Mr. Du Yu as the leading actor, and successively acted in several films such as "Tales of the Orient," "Hate of a Fallen Woman," and "Beautiful Island." At that time, my "stage name" was "Wang Chunyuan."

Most of the films I starred in at Shanghai Company were martial arts and action films. At that time, the style of film tended towards this aspect, so this type of work was very popular with the audience. In that period, there was absolutely no talk of any "consciousness," so I also blindly followed suit, and worked vigorously on the film set doing fighting work.

### Big King, Second King - A Tale of Rivalry in the Wilderness (4)

— Uncle Fei

—Fifth of Rambling Recollections by the Plum Tree—

This story is finished, and it could have ended here. But I have a slight feeling about this, I wonder if the editor will allow me to finish my words? (Ancient writing style, after recording events, a brief commentary is added to conclude. Like Wei Bing's collection of essays, Uncle Wei's Diary, I might as well copy the sages and have a Li Uncle say:)

The dispute between Zhu and Xu was originally a kind of unconscious venting of anger, which is not worth discussing. But they did not want others to know, and they had a spirit of hard work. Often when they were discovered by colleagues backstage, when the Black Pool Dragon was found, they sighed at each other, expressing disappointment! Because they were not able to implement their original intention, to decide the winner, this is indeed a great regret in the world! It is also normal for a third party to come out to mediate, and there was no pressure to make them comply. At the same time, the two people did not lose face, and they could avoid the harm of both sides being injured. Although later there was a distinction between the Big King and the Second King, this is a factual issue of the past, and it seems that there is no need to care. From now on, when colleagues call Zhu Xiangquan, they all call him Second King instead of his name, and Zhu does not think it is a disgrace. If the third party wants one party to apologize to the other party, or even ask him to take out medical expenses to give to the other party, then this is a humiliating peace! I think the two of them would definitely not accept it, and would definitely go back to fighting! So I think there are too many ways to make peace, there is "glorious peace," there is "shameful peace," and there is "neither glorious nor shameful peace." "Glorious peace" is the peace of victory, "shameful peace" is the peace of defeat; "neither glorious nor shameful peace" is like the peace of Zhu and Xu. Human psychology, of course, wants to take "obtaining glorious peace" as the best policy. The late teacher Nantong Zhang Jian once said: "Since ancient times, domestic and foreign conflicts have only two strategies, war and peace. Peace takes the current peace, and war is a comprehensive plan for the overall situation. To make peace for the sake of peace, is to say that the argument of ceasing war comes from me, then I am weak and he is strong; to make war for the sake of peace, so that the request for peace comes from him, then he is weak and I stretch." How wise is this saying! It is truly an unchanging principle. After writing the Tale of Rivalry in the Wilderness, I suddenly had some feelings, and I added a few words to the end of the article, feeling that I was too verbose! Readers, please don't be surprised! (End)

### Fan Xuepeng Will Rejoin Green Jewel

— Yu Di

The leading actress of the Green Jewel Theater was formerly Fan Xuepeng. She went from the silver screen to the stage of spoken drama, and naturally she was deeply welcomed by the audience. Unfortunately, Fan's physique was weak, and she could not bear the burden of performing on stage day and night. After a doctor's diagnosis, she was said to have lung disease, so she was so frightened that she repeatedly resigned from Green Jewel. After Fan Xuepeng left, Green Jewel "specially invited Zhu Qiuhen to fill the vacancy, but Zhu Qiuhen could not cope, and her appeal was not enough, so she changed to invite the current Wang Xueyan to take over.

After several months of rest, not long ago, Fan Xuepeng went to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road to use X-rays to examine her lungs. As a result, it was found that her lung lobes were undamaged, which proved that Fan Xuepeng did not have lung disease! When the Green Jewel authorities received this news, they sent someone to visit and invite her, asking Fan Xuepeng to return to Green Jewel. It is said that she has agreed to the request. If the conditions are negotiated, she may be on stage at Green Jewel from August 1.

### Recent Developments in Various Opera Troupes in the Old Capital

— Yan Yan

Although there are many opera troupes in the old capital, except for Fuliancheng, the Opera School, and Rongchunshe, the others are insignificant. The following describes the recent developments of the three troupes, to inform those who are concerned.

(1) Fuliancheng Society: Fulianshe, with Ye Shengzhang as the center, suffered heatstroke while performing the play Ouyang De at the Jixiang Theater on the 4th of the month, so he did not perform for many days, and the plays were performed by Huang Yuanqing and others. The rising martial arts students have neat roles and great progress in art. Recently, it was heard that the president of the society, Ye Wenfu, said that he would discuss with the martial arts professor Wang Lianping to rehearse the entire "Three Heroes and Five Gallants." This play is the old collection of the society's Xiaorongchun troupe. From Bai Yutang searching for the imperial cat and the five heroes seeing him off, to capturing Bai Yutang at Dulong Bridge, it is original and different from others. Once the entire cast is selected, they will start rehearsing and premiere at the Huale Theater.

(2) Opera School: Recently, the school authorities announced the academic achievements of the students in the past year. Hou Yulan was the first in Qingyi, Li Hehui was the first in Laosheng, Wang Jinlu was the first in Wusheng, Li Jinquan was the first in Laodan, Yuan Jinmian was the first in Wujing. Hou Yulan alone occupied the top spot in the overall score, and Wang Jinlu was the runner-up. Also, this autumn is the 15th anniversary of the school's founding, and it is also the day when Wang Jinlu, Li He, Zeng Wang Helin and others graduate, so it was decided to hold a grand founding anniversary and graduation ceremony on that day.

(3) Rongchunshe: Rongchunshe focuses on rehearsing original plays and old plays, and has performed many of them one after another. Recently, there is a play "Five Righteous Ones" that can be performed. Shang Xiaoyun gave the role of the Pipa Fairy to Sun Ronghui, Cai Ronggui gave the entire Catch and Release to Xu Rongkui, and in addition, there is the entire Stab Bajie, with Shang Changchun playing Luo Hongxun, Sun Ruichun playing Hu Li, and Tian Rongfen playing Bajiu's wife. These three good plays have all been rehearsed skillfully and will be performed one after another, to give the people of the old capital the limit of happiness.

### Yi Hua Miscellaneous News

Diao Banhu's posture is beautiful. Two months ago, Yi Hua Propaganda made every effort to produce the costume film "Wang Baochuan." At that time, there was a battle between Wang Yang and Gu Han for the role of Princess Daizhan. Yi Hua was difficult to deal with, so she changed to Diao Banhu. According to Wu Cun, the director of the film, Diao's role as Princess Daizhan is extremely beautiful. Diao's facial contours are very suitable for the costumes of this role, and she is also very heroic.

Ning Xuan has a lot of gimmicks. Miss Ning Xuan, plays amateur and makes movies, then movies and dances, then dances and plays amateur, and then returns to the silver screen from the amateur world. In recent years, she has been changing in cycles, which shows that this lady is very active. Miss Ning is originally from the South, but she has lived in Beiping since she was a child, so she speaks very beautiful Mandarin. This time, Chen Kengran, the director of "Women's Apartment," specially invited her to play a very important role as "Wang Refang." "Women's Apartment" started filming with her scene. Miss Ning's years of experience have indeed made her acting skills improve rapidly. Everyone says "Ning Xuan is really promising."

Lan Lan appears on the silver screen. Those who have seen the stage play "Women's Apartment" are very satisfied with Miss Lan Lan, who plays Chen Peipei. The standard Chen Peipei finally appeared on the silver screen. Miss Lan Lan, for the sake of the beauty of the lens, did not hesitate to endure the pain of flesh and blood, and cut her eyelids to make them double eyelids, which is particularly charming. When the film "Women's Apartment" is released, it is expected that many movie fans will be captivated by Chen Peipei on the silver screen.

### Chess Garden

— Edited by Bao Zibo, Revised by Lu Chengzu

Opening Method - Fifty-fifth Game

Black First

Move according to the previous game

Rook 9 to 6　Elephant 3 advances 5　Rook 6 advances 5　Pawn 3 advances 1

Explanation: It should be connected with cannon first, then the chariot is activated. Whether using horizontal chariot or straight chariot, each has its own advantages. However, straight chariot seems to be slightly better, like Shaolin and Wudang in boxing. From cannon 2 to 5 to pawn 7 advances 1, the black side still does not advance the chariot, which is a missed opportunity, resulting in the red side cannon 8 advances 4 pressing the chariot.

From Rook 9 to 6 to pawn 3 advances 1, at this time, the black side loses the spirit of connection, while the red side's pieces are active. The reason for this is entirely due to the loss of the chariot chance.

Chess News: The Hualian Tongle Association at No. 194 Nanjing Road initiated the Hualian Cup Amateur Team Chess Championship. Registration has begun and will close on the 27th of August. The competition will begin on the 19th of September. It is hoped that all chess teams will actively participate.

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

The Meaning of the Ten-Minute Break Before the Final Play

According to the old rules of the Pear Garden, it is not allowed to "cut the gong" in the middle of the play. "Cutting the gong" is the opposite of "opening the gong." Although the scene in the middle of the play is mainly dominated by the drum, which is like the life of the three armies, the rules of the opera troupe have always been to say open the gong instead of opening the drum when the play starts. For example, a certain role is the first play of the opening, or the first three plays before the opening of the gong. This is all that is usually said. As for the end of each day's play, it was previously said that a certain garden had already cut the gong, but now it is all changed to "stop." In theory, both the big gong and the small gong are important instruments to support the action. During the performance of martial arts plays, when the two armies are facing each other and holding up knives and guns, at this time, the sound of the big gong is used to inspire the spirit of the actors and the audience. Even in literary plays, the steps and movements of the sheng, dan, and chou roles when they enter the scene, as well as the literati's posture and expression, cannot make people feel relaxed and happy without the sound of the small gong. Therefore, in the past, each garden was very cautious when allocating plays. After a loud and deafening martial arts play, it was always followed by a funny skit. As soon as the loud sound of the gong and drum stopped, the sound of the small gong immediately followed, like a violent storm followed by a slight sunshine, revealing a faint blue sky, and the cool breeze was really comfortable. The turbid air that had been suffocating in the heart for a long time could also be completely exhaled at this time. The power of the big gong and the small gong to shift the movement on the stage and the audience's attention is so great, so the name "opening the gong" has its own reason when it was first proposed. Furthermore, such as the "gong and drum sutra" that people in the scene are familiar with, and the insiders often say what kind of gong and drum should be played in a certain place in a certain play, this "starting the gong and drum" also has the word gong at the beginning, which is probably another clear proof that the opening play should be called the opening gong play.

### Prefect Rong Shaves His Head and Hires a Beautiful Woman

Prefect Rong Hong, who was sent to the United States to supervise the affairs of the foreign affairs bureau, recently heard that he married an American woman named Keller as his wife, and immediately changed his clothes and shaved his hair, intending to live in the United States for a long time and not return to his ancestral land. Lord Li Xiang knew about his hiring of a wife and was also very happy! Alas, how strange! If the students studying in the United States follow his example, they will drive the Chinese people to become Americans. However, there must be a deep meaning in this matter, which outsiders cannot know. The matter of shaving one's hair and changing one's clothes cannot but startle those who hear about it! This time, he was forced to change, and his heart was nothing more than a plan to please his wife. Nowadays, people love the people in their room, and they will naturally follow their wishes in everything, and especially this braid, which is like a wart, should be hated by the emotional woman, and there is a situation where it has to be cut off.

### Three Wonderful Couplets

(1) A certain family in Hangzhou has a huge area at the gate, saying: "Grandfather, son, father, brother, uncle, nephew, the home of the Hanlin." A well-meaning person continued: "But the person in the middle is not involved." And he wrote a couplet saying: "Eating, drinking, whoring, gambling, swaggering and cheating, bad seeds do everything, only Yu Jizi is capable of it." (2) The Dragon God Temple in Zhejiang Province has a couplet saying: "Flying in the sky, seeing in the fields, changes show functions, rampant in summer." "Slowly clouds, abundant rain, Yin and Yang support changes in theory, and there is also autumn." (3) In the Guangxu Yewei year, a certain government office in Henan Province congratulated the Emperor's longevity couplet: "Taiyun experiences six symbols, driving six dragons, leading the six palaces in the inner six palaces, the six ministers outside, the six residences, coordinating the six laws and six concordances of the Tai Chang, and celebrating the empress dowager's 60th birthday." "Kunyi becomes ten numbers, and the ten emblems are sublime, combining the ten records of heaven, the ten poles of earth, and the ten ethics of man, celebrating the festival on the tenth day of the tenth month, and respectfully meeting the sacred master for ten or five years."

### Rain Grain

In the local area of Xinghua Prefecture, Fujian Province, there has recently been a rain of grain. The husks of the grain are no different from those taken from the fields, but when the rice grains are peeled off from them, they are sometimes green, black, or other colors.

Spring and Autumn Annals

### Before Sunrise

— Lu Si

Directing a play, this is the second time. The first time was a disastrous defeat. I am really worried that I will not be able to do it and repeat the mistakes of the past.

One morning two weeks ago, Mr. Tan, the person in charge of the Baolian Theater Troupe, came to me in the wind and rain through the introduction of Mr. Jin Xin, asking me to direct Mr. Shen You's "Before Sunrise" for them.

At that time, the fate of Chekhov's "The Seagull" immediately came to my mind: the unprecedented disastrous defeat of the first decision in St. Petersburg, and the unprecedented success of the performance at the Moscow Art Academy. The same script, but the performance results of the two times were so different. This shows how important the director's understanding of the script is, and his artistic and political accomplishments can determine the life and death of the play and affect the success or failure of the play's performance.

Therefore, I politely declined. I doubt my artistic cultivation, and I don't trust my understanding of the script. I am afraid that I will invisibly become an executioner and kill the life of Mr. Shen You's script.

However, they did not allow me to decline. They said that this decision was a "charity performance," and the position of director should be a matter of honor.

Under the premise of "directing a charity sale," I silently agreed. But my heart became as heavy as lead again. I thought: To rush out a four-act play in just twelve days, I always felt that it was a loss of artistic dignity. However, this was also inevitable, because the charity performance could not be postponed because of Baolian's "Before Sunrise." Therefore, during the entire ten days of rehearsals, I felt extremely painful, and the inner conflict between "art" and "relief" was strongly tormented.

Now it's good, and my mood has returned to peace. Thanks to the actors' intelligence and hard work, I finally removed a big stone that had been pressing on my heart for a long time, and I can breathe a sigh of relief comfortably.

"Before Sunrise" was written by Mr. Shen You two years ago out of "inspiration." However, today, things have changed. As Mr. Shen You himself said: "The time and environment in which this play was written are very different from the present." Therefore, to put this play on today's stage, the objects of exposure and satire by Mr. Shen You must be greatly shifted.

I should thank Mr. Shen You for allowing me to change his masterpiece as much as possible; at the same time, I should also express my deep apologies to Mr. Shen You, because I really made some bold changes to his masterpiece.

I believe that in the feudal environment of a large family like Huang Weiren, the tragedy predicted by the playwright Shen You will inevitably occur, and the main factor that creates the tragedy of Daozhong is undoubtedly the old and unreasonable social relationship; and all the conflicts and struggles here are also without objection, and are entirely produced by the outdated large family system.

Therefore, I give a different interpretation to the theme of "Before Sunrise." I only regard "Before Sunrise" as a true picture of the collapse of the large family system.

Based on this point of view, I made the eldest young mistress and the third brother Huang Weilian even more opposed to each other, and strengthened the struggle between them, which is the struggle between the new and the old.

Therefore, when I directed this play, I did not regard "Before Sunrise" as a tragedy, but as a tragicomedy.——I particularly emphasized the end of this play. Although three people are dead on the stage, I do not allow the audience to come back with sadness. I want them to smile with tears, go back with a new hope, and I want them to feel a new strength to go back!

Although I say so sharply, I dare not say what the effect of the performance will be. I hope my friends can give me some serious criticism.

### Appeal from Graduating Students in the Occupied Areas

— Sincerely submitted by students in the occupied areas

Dear Editor:

I was studying in Beiping in the past year. After graduating from middle school this summer, I came to Shanghai with full enthusiasm, hoping to take the national university entrance examination. If I could be admitted, I could temporarily eliminate all the pain I had felt in the occupied areas in the past, wouldn't that be very happy. So I paid attention to the joint examination registration and enrollment advertisements every day. The day before yesterday, I saw that the joint examination was scheduled, so of course I stepped up my preparations, but what I never dreamed of was that the staff at the registration office looked at my diploma and said: "This diploma says Beijing and cannot take the examination. If an exception is made, it would seem to recognize the puppet government, so the Education Bureau does not recognize this type of graduation certificate unless you get another valid diploma." This is like a thunderbolt from a clear sky, and a basin of cold water has been poured on my full enthusiasm. It is also said: "This issue will be decided after the authorities have a meeting." This sentence is nothing more than a comfort, so as not to make me despair. Therefore, I, Minren, feel that the issue of not being allowed to take the examination really has two points that need to be discussed:

(1) In order to adapt to the environment, the people who run education in the occupied area—Beiping—have had to change Beiping to Beijing. This was originally a matter of force majeure. It is by no means what the people who run education are willing to do. If they insist on not changing, the school will inevitably close. Students with ample financial resources can indeed find ways to study abroad, so there is no problem. Then how will another group of students from poor families solve it? At that time, the education authorities did not seem to pay attention to this point, so there was no appropriate remedy. Therefore, we students continued to complete our middle school studies as before. Who would have thought that we would have the distress of not being allowed to take the examination today.

(2) Because the students in the occupied areas cannot bear all kinds of insults, they are very willing to go to the interior to study. But now they are not allowed to stay. Under this situation, we will inevitably be called back to the tiger's mouth to spend the rest of our lives. This method is probably not what everyone wants.

Therefore, from the above two points of view, the education authorities should best formulate an appropriate resolution under the principle of not spending too much money and time, so as to avoid us, the students in the occupied areas, from going back to live a life of tears!

There must be many people like me who have suffered depression, so I boldly ask your column to grant publication, so as to attract the attention of the education authorities, and I will be very grateful.

### Mr. Chen Xinru's Calligraphy

### Biographical Sketches of Female Ballad Singers

— Shen You

As for Pei Lan's later years, Volume 2 of "Seashore Beauties" has a record, saying: "In the summer of Gengchen (1880), she was appreciated by a certain county magistrate's son, and a song Seeking the Phoenix became a marriage bond. Not long after, the son died of diabetes. The brocade quilt was empty and fragrant, and the mandarin ducks guarded alone. It is heard that the prostitute has advised her to cut off all ties with the world, and will use a hundred and eight mani beads to end her life." Pei Lan's later fate was also very sad. This was the female ballad singer who was known for her charity at the time. In terms of talent, there was Cheng Daixiang. Volume 1 of "Dream Shadows":

There is a female ballad singer in Shanghai named Cheng Daixiang, who is quite famous for her ability to write poetry, and she is especially infatuated. She once boasted that she wanted to have both Daiyu and Xiangjun, so she used it as her name. In the Xiang Pavilion, there is a painting of Feng Xiaoqing's song. Her face is similar in appearance. Daixiang often talks to her in the morning and evening, and has a special understanding. She once wrote three jueju poems saying: "Burning the poems and essays, I will end this life. Don't be affectionate in the next life. You say you only pity your shadow, I will pity you as much as you can." "I write poems on the subject of the exotic song, and I have thoughts about the old things in Qiantang. There is little Qing before and little Xiaoqing, both are talented women and have infatuation." Her self-admiration can also be imagined. More than ten years have passed since Daixiang died, and the poems are still extant. It is rare to find. Recording one or two of them is also a fragment of good fortune in the Misty Fragrant Cave.

In addition, there is Yuan Yaqin. "Records of Lustful Travels, Volume 3: Aka Yuan Yaqin, a native of Jiahe, ... a descendant of an official. ... At the time of Qingxin, Ji was only six years old, lost and had no return, and was sold by the wet nurse, so she belonged to the music register, using ballads to gain entanglement. She is calm and quiet, and does not speak or laugh easily..." However, her story still has a tragic nature. Her own experiences are similar to the legendary comedies in old novels, and none of them are more than Qi Kongzhi. "Ying Wei Suo Ji" contains the master of Hongdouguan in Wumen, "A Biography of Ye Kongzhi," which describes her person and her affairs in the most detail. (13)

### Rouge Tiger

— Bai Hua

"Person In Hiding"

A Paramount Pictures production, playing at the Nanjing Grand Theatre

This newcomer from Paramount! Mary Morrison, in "Rouge Tiger," has already achieved astonishing success. Her composed face and sharp gaze are the best conditions for her to play villainous roles, and in the romantic arena, the expression of her generally contained passion is similar to that of Dorothy Lamour. We should pay attention to her next work, and I predict she will take the latter path.

This script was written by a G-Man with a history of solving cases. Naturally, writing such a script from the perspective of someone who has experienced it firsthand has its unique aspects. For example, the scene of undercover arrests is truly written with meticulous detail and thoughtfulness. However, he does not portray Dorothy's vanity strongly enough. Such a woman certainly has the possibility of falling, but her ability to immediately strategize and appear as the "Rouge Tiger," committing crimes, is ultimately a bit far-fetched. If the screenwriter had removed the scenes after the undercover arrest (ending the play at this climax would also be natural), and instead emphasized Dorothy's gradual descent in the preceding scenes, thus creating the "Rouge Tiger's" status, the achievement of this play might have been even greater than it is now.

The director tries to avoid robbery scenes as much as possible and focuses on Dorothy's life, which is what makes it endearing and avoids being identical to all other G-Men works. For example, after Dorothy and Martin commit a robbery and escape to the farmhouse where her parents live, he makes it clear that the father and daughter have not seen each other for two years, and there is familial love between the mother and daughter. But when the mother discovers that her daughter is a terrible person, she drives her away and does not allow the father to accept their gifts. The emotion in this scene is very strong. The climax of the undercover arrest is even better at tightly gripping the tense atmosphere that escalates step by step. Of course, half of the credit must also go to the script.

The scenes after the undercover arrest inevitably become somewhat lax. However, Dorothy, unable to bear her elderly mother's arrest, decides to reveal Martin's hiding place as a condition, preparing to flee herself, which gives Mary Morrison and Carl Nash (Martin) another opportunity to act. For example, during their separation and when Dorothy is telephoning the police station, both actors are able to demonstrate their acting skills.
