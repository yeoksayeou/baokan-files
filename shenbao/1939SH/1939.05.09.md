### Chinese Troops on Various Fronts in Central Jiangxi, Southern Hubei, and Northern Hunan Gain Strategic Initiative; Japanese Fiercely Attack Xianghua Road Without Success; Fierce Fighting Near Fengle River; Japanese Troops in Chongyang East Swept Away; Tongcheng Surrounded by Chinese Troops; Nanchang City Breached Once, Japanese Now Counterattacking in Three Routes, Chinese Troops Advancing in Two; Japanese Troops in Pengze Displaying Signs of Wavering

(Changsha) Since the Chinese troops launched offensives on the fronts of Central Jiangxi, Southern Hubei, and Northern Hunan, more than ten days have passed, and nearly fifty major and minor battles have been fought. Significant results have been achieved in both strategy and tactics. First, the Japanese plan to transfer troops to invade Northern Hunan has been thwarted by the Chinese offensives. Second, in each battle, Chinese troops have been able to exchange small sacrifices for great victories, with the total gains exceeding Chinese consumption and casualties by more than twofold. Third, each Chinese offensive has managed to seize the initiative, engaging the Japanese everywhere, causing them to be overwhelmed, exhausted, and unable to retaliate. Fourth, each area attacked by the Chinese is a vital point for the Japanese, often causing them significant losses and threats. One particular characteristic is that the Chinese troops' coordination of mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare has become increasingly sophisticated in this offensive, with a tendency to transition from guerrilla tactics to regular field army tactics. Therefore, although the Chinese troops are not currently seeking to quickly occupy points, they are sometimes willing to defend occupied areas with all their might at certain times.

Yesterday, rumors circulated that armed Chinese guerrillas had been discovered in the city, so a curfew was implemented, but after a thorough search of the city, no armed Chinese were found.

Editorial

### From the "Twenty-One Demands" to the "New Order in East Asia"

— Commemorating the Anti-Japanese War and Canceling "May Ninth" —

Today is once again "May Ninth." Twenty-four years ago, the world was in a frenzy of war, engaging in the re-division of the world. At that time, Yuan Shikai, a feudal remnant who controlled Chinese politics, was dreaming of becoming an emperor. Japan, therefore, believed that this was a "once in a lifetime" opportunity to carry out its long-planned invasion of China, in order to realize its long-standing fantasy of dominating the Far East. It first used the pretext of declaring war on Germany to send troops to attack Qingdao, occupying Shandong. Subsequently, under the pretext that China's request for troop withdrawal was an insult to Japan, the Japanese Minister to China, Hioki Eki, suddenly presented the Twenty-One Demands to Yuan Shikai. The content is divided into five groups: the first group of articles demanded the inheritance of Germany's rights in Shandong and the expansion of Japanese influence; the second group of articles allowed Japan to gain a monopoly position in Southern Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia; the third group of articles made the Daye Iron Mine and Pingxiang Coal Mine jointly owned by China and Japan; the fourth group directly sought to annex the entire territory of China, prohibiting others from interfering; the fifth group of articles, such as hiring advisors, was even more of a condition that treated China as a Japanese protectorate. In short, these Twenty-One Demands were completely the shackles of Japan's attempt to destroy China. However, Yuan Shikai was mired in the dream of imperial restoration and dared not refuse outright, secretly entrusting such a major matter to one or two diplomats to negotiate with Japan in secret. At this point, Japan naturally did not relax its grip, and on May 7, 1915, presented Yuan Shikai with an ultimatum, requiring a response by the ninth. Yuan Shikai, on the morning of May 9, ordered Cao Rulin to send a reply to the Japanese legation, agreeing to all but the fifth group of items. If it were not for the passionate opposition of the Chinese people and the righteous intervention of the international community, Yuan Shikai's reply would almost have become an ironclad case of selling out China's sovereignty and interests.

Invading China is a traditional Japanese policy, and the "Twenty-One Demands" can be said to be the first major revelation of Japan's ambition towards China. For twenty-four years, Japan's aggression against China has never ceased for a single day, but has changed its form from time to time depending on the international environment and the internal situation in China. When the international balance of power was stable and the Chinese people's movement was active, Japan took the opportunity to advance slowly, as exemplified by the situation around the Washington Conference. When the international balance of power was shaken or destroyed, and the Chinese people's movement was relatively sluggish, Japan would advance headlong, and the "September 18th" Incident in 1931 was launched under these circumstances.

When the world was in the midst of an economic panic in 1929, the great powers were overwhelmed and unable to care for themselves. Japan seized this opportunity to act freely in the Far East, using the Wanbaoshan Incident as a test, and the reaction was lukewarm. Finally, on September 18, 1931, the Beida Camp incident was launched. In a few days, the fertile three northeastern provinces of China, and thirty million Chinese people, fell into the hands of the Japanese army. At that time, Japan was "proud and satisfied," and elated. Therefore, it tried its best to expand the incident. On January 28, 1932, the Shanghai Incident broke out. Although it lasted only a month, the Chinese army finally retreated, but the heroic achievements of the Chinese army broke the general pessimism of the Chinese people and shifted the international psychology towards Japan.

Aggressors are "never satisfied." Seeing China's internal disunity and the international community's complacent peace, Japan marched into Shanhaiguan in January 1933, occupied Rehe in March, and captured various passes of the Great Wall. Since Japan's military actions were successful step by step, it simply demanded to annex the entire China. On April 17, 1934, the obscure Tiani made a statement, openly excluding the interests of European and American countries, and even treating China as a Japanese protectorate. Although this type of statement has absolutely no legal standing and his intention was merely to test the international community, the statement exposed his ambitions and proved the hypocrisy of various diplomatic rhetoric before and after.

Thus, from the "September 18th" Incident, the "January 28th" Incident, to the Great Wall War of Resistance, China always tolerated in many ways. Japan thought that bayonets could scare China, and it stepped up its pressure on China step by step. However, there is a limit to tolerance. The Lugouqiao Incident on July 7, 1937, finally aroused the heroic resistance of the Chinese army. The cannons of "August 13" opened the massive curtain of China's all-out war of resistance. This had long been seen by international observers and repeatedly warned, but was probably unexpected by the Japanese side!

Now, China and Japan have been at war for over ten months: China's bloody struggle has entered a new stage. Although China has lost many cities, the morale and fighting spirit of the Chinese front, and the increasingly favorable domestic and foreign conditions possessed by China, stand in stark contrast to Japan. The Japanese side has also seen the determination of China's resistance and the unity of the national will, and cannot help but feel panic and trepidation. Therefore, while continuing its military operations, it is also working hard on political conspiracies and diplomatic activities, and the so-called New Order in East Asia is a smokescreen for political diplomacy!

The international community will never be deceived by the "New Order in East Asia." The notes from countries such as Britain, the United States, and France to Japan have made a clear denial. On the Chinese side, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has directly revealed its hidden intentions, pointed out sharply: "What kind of evil intentions are contained under the seven words of building a new order in East Asia? In simple terms, this is a total name for overturning the international order in East Asia, creating a slave China, in order to achieve its ambition of dominating the Pacific and dividing the world." Every Chinese person knows that because of the international torch of justice shining outside and the leader leading the national policy of resistance and construction inside, Japan, no matter what attractive slogans it shouts or what good-looking banners it displays, will not stop until it has destroyed China or exhausted its own aggression. Therefore, it is well known that China must resist to the end. This belief of the Chinese government and the people is by no means created by China and those who sympathize with China by calling on each other with any sophistry, nor can it be shaken by sophistry that destroys China.

From the "Twenty-One Demands" to the "New Order in East Asia," the whole world has seen Japan's step-by-step intensification of its aggression against China. The so-called "New Order in East Asia" is actually a continuation and expansion of the "Twenty-One Demands." The historical lessons and bloody lessons of Japan's aggression against China over the past twenty-four years have finally awakened the 450 million people of China. Today, China's war of resistance is a positive response to "May Ninth" and "May Seventh" and the "Twenty-One Demands," replacing "May Ninth." In the past, Chinese society commemorated "May Ninth" with sorrow and tears; now, Chinese troops are canceling "May Ninth" with heroism and iron blood. The international community showed empty words of sympathy in the past, but the international community is providing practical assistance today!

### A Japanese Plane Conducts Night Reconnaissance Over Chongqing

Anti-Aircraft Artillery Remains Silent, Residents Spend Entire Night in Trenches, Authorities Properly Plan Relief for Refugees

(Chongqing) The government is making every effort to assist refugees from occupied cities. Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang are deeply concerned and have resolved to provide maximum assistance. The relief efforts are currently being managed by the Relief Committee and the Chongqing Air Raid Emergency Relief Joint Office. It is reported that the central government has decided to allocate three million yuan for relief expenses, of which one million yuan has already been allocated. Plans are also in place to raise the remaining two million yuan.

Regarding relief measures, the government has established dozens of refugee reception centers to specifically accommodate refugees who have lost their homes due to Japanese air raids. After a short rest at the reception centers, the government will transfer them to various counties, mainly by waterway, supplemented by highway. The authorities have dispatched personnel to various counties to find housing. If there are no vacant houses, new houses will be built for the refugees to live in after the evacuation. The government will also provide refugees with all necessary expenses. Upon evacuation, each person, regardless of age or gender, will receive an evacuation allowance of one yuan. After departure, each person will receive one yuan per day for food and lodging until they reach their destination. Upon arrival, impoverished refugees who are unable to support themselves will receive a monthly allowance of four yuan to maintain their livelihood, for a period of three months. At the same time, the government has decided to find a way to solve the long-term living problems of the refugees. Relief agencies are planning to cooperate with central production agencies to organize production projects to provide employment for the refugees. It is reported that these relief measures apply not only to the victims but also to ordinary citizens who voluntarily evacuate to various counties. (8th dispatch)

(Chongqing) Shortly after midnight last night, the air raid siren blared, and Chongqing residents spent the entire night in air raid shelters. At 00:30, a Japanese plane was seen flying towards Chongqing, triggering the first alert. At 01:05, the Japanese plane appeared closer to Chongqing, and the emergency alarm was sounded. However, the Japanese bomber did not come here, and the all-clear was not sounded until 04:45 this morning. According to reports from Chinese officials, a Japanese plane lingered over Chongqing for a long time, clearly for reconnaissance purposes. The Chinese side turned on searchlights, but the anti-aircraft artillery did not fire. (8th Reuters dispatch)

(Chongqing) According to the latest official announcement, the total number of casualties from the bombings of Chongqing on May 3rd and 4th is currently 3,500. There are still bodies buried in the rubble. The number of dead and wounded are roughly equal. From May 5th to 7th, the government facilitated the evacuation of a total of 200,000 refugees. This does not include those who evacuated on foot, by rickshaw, or by sedan. (8th Reuters dispatch)

(Chongqing) After the two bombings of Chongqing, a new way of life has been implemented. Most banks have changed their office hours to 7:00 to 9:00 AM, and government offices begin work after 2:00 PM. Stores have also decided to stop business from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. At the same time, the government has ordered all stores to resume business after 4:00 PM to allow the public to buy food. An Associated Press reporter walked one and a half miles today and confirmed that one-third of the city had been destroyed, and there were only 200 people in the bombed area. Workers are busy excavating charred corpses. In addition, the government plans to move six hospitals outside the city to avoid accidental losses during Japanese bombings. The injured are first transferred to hospitals in the city for first aid and then transferred to hospitals outside the city for surgery. According to an Associated Press reporter quoting personnel from the New Life Movement, the organization plans to establish "industrial camps" to help the affected workers. All products from the "industrial camps" will be transported to the General Chamber of Commerce for sale. In addition, grocery stores will be set up to provide refugees with work, and residents can also purchase various supplies. Workers can earn one and a half yuan per day. The grocery stores are located on the highway outside the city leading to Chengdu. Since the bombing of Chongqing, the New Life Movement has been providing food to 30,000 refugees every day. The most interesting and touching thing is the clinic set up by the government in the YMCA, where the injured receive five to twenty yuan, depending on the severity of the injury. The families of the deceased receive thirty yuan each. Foreign correspondents residing in Chongqing will form a "laundry cooperative." All foreign correspondents must participate in the laundry work, as the laundry workers have left Chongqing to seek refuge. Even more comically, when the laundry workers left the city, they took away all the clothes, including underwear, entrusted to them by foreigners, leaving most foreigners with only the coats on their backs.

(Fuzhou) In recent weeks, Japanese warships have intensified their blockade of Chinese coastal ports. No fewer than thirty or forty British, American, French, and German merchant ships have been detained and searched by Japanese warships in the waters off Fujian, Zhejiang, and Guangdong.

It is reported that the British government has now decided to dispatch a large number of warships to southern China to protect navigation rights and has ordered all merchant ships to install gun mounts and implement armed self-defense.

### Central Government Remains in Chongqing

Relocation Rumors Untrue

(Chongqing) Rumors spread by the Japanese that the Chinese government has moved from Chongqing to Chengdu are absolutely untrue. According to reliable sources, the Chinese government will remain in Chongqing. Most administrative agencies will be dispersed in the countryside outside the city, but not far away, allowing close contact with each other. The British Consulate Office has moved to the south bank of the Yangtze River, and the German and French consulates have also moved to the western suburbs. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador, flew to Chengdu on Saturday, but according to reliable sources, the ambassador's trip is absolutely unrelated to the bombing of Chongqing. He had intended to visit Chengdu some time ago, and arrangements were made before the bombing. According to a Reuters reporter in Chengdu, the British Ambassador arrived in Chengdu on May 6th as planned and inspected the beautiful campus of the West China Union University on the day of the annual sports meet. The universities participating in the sports meet included West China University, Nanjing University, Ginling College, National Central University, and Cheeloo University. All five schools are located on the same campus. Sir Archibald Clark Kerr was very interested in the various sports competitions. After a short stay in Chengdu, he will return to Chongqing.

### British-Soviet Mutual Assistance Negotiations Reach Critical Juncture British Ambassador Submits Proposal to Molotov Soviet Union Tells Britain Policy Unchanged

(Moscow) The British Ambassador Seeds had a 40-minute meeting with Molotov today. The results were not disclosed. (8th Reuters dispatch)

(Moscow) British Ambassador Sir William Seeds is scheduled to visit the new People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, this afternoon to personally deliver his country's counter-proposal regarding the formation of an anti-aggression group. It is said to advocate (1) the Soviet Union providing security guarantees to its neighboring countries unilaterally, (2) Britain providing assistance if the country is drawn into a war vortex due to fulfilling the guarantee. (8th Havas dispatch)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons today that the British government has telegraphed its further expressions to the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, to be forwarded to the Soviet government. It is not appropriate to make public statements while conducting this diplomatic exchange of views. A member asked whether the government intends to strive for full cooperation with the Soviet Union to build a system based on mutual guarantees to resist aggression from any party. The Prime Minister replied that the government's current policy aims to achieve full cooperation with the Soviet Union. Labor member Fletcher asked whether the Soviet policy would be affected by the change of foreign minister. The Prime Minister said that this could not be answered definitively. The Prime Minister also answered a question from Labor leader Attlee, denying that the government's procedures for obtaining national security had been delayed in any way. (8th Reuters dispatch)

(London) During the House of Commons meeting today, Conservative member Boothby asked whether the Prime Minister knew that the majority of the British people advocated a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union, given the guarantees Britain had given to Poland and Romania, and the increasing concern among the public that future necessary steps to fulfill these guarantees might not be possible. Would the Prime Minister issue an assurance stating that he would do his best to conclude a treaty between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union as soon as possible? The Prime Minister replied that he was unaware that the British people had the opportunity to express such opinions to a greater extent than Mr. Boothby had just stated. (8th Reuters dispatch)

(London) A Daily Telegraph correspondent in Moscow reported that there was an optimistic opportunity for the agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union on the European political situation. British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir William Seeds, will first visit the new People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, today. However, the newspaper's diplomatic correspondent said that the facts were not so optimistic. Previously, Britain had instructed Ambassador Seeds to ask the Soviet government whether it still supported the proposal put forward by Britain on April 16. If the Soviet Union's reply was affirmative, then the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union could proceed to explain Britain's position to the Soviet authorities. Another dispatch from the Daily Telegraph correspondent in Moscow stated that Stalin held a meeting with several Central Executive Committee members yesterday. The result of the discussion was that they expressed understanding of Britain's views. The correspondent speculated that the Soviet Union might be prepared to conclude an alliance with Britain and France. (8th Haitong dispatch)

(Moscow) The French Chargé d'Affaires Bérard recently visited Ambassador Seeds on this day and conducted talks with each other. The embassies of Britain and France are in close contact. (7th Havas dispatch)

(London) Reuters has learned that the British government has obtained assurances that Soviet foreign policy will not change due to the resignation of former Foreign Commissar Litvinov. (8th Reuters dispatch)

(London) Regarding the resignation of Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov, the country's ambassador Maisky is said to have notified the British government that the country's policy will not be changed as a result. However, some people here still have doubts. In short, what Soviet policy will be depends on the meeting between the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Seeds, and the new Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, on this day before it can be seen. (8th Havas dispatch)

(Moscow) Speculation about changes in Soviet foreign policy continued today. There is no indication of a sudden change in the political bureau that has always directed Soviet foreign policy. Soviet political figures pointed out that the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs is not the person in charge of Soviet foreign policy. The press has not hinted at the possibility of changing policy. Rumors of a Soviet-German reconciliation still lack solid evidence. Political figures believe that the possibility of such a reconciliation is extremely small. (8th Associated Press dispatch)

(Moscow) Soviet officials and newspapers have remained silent about the resignation of Foreign Commissar Litvinov. According to a Soviet official, Soviet newspapers have not criticized foreign affairs for several weeks because the current international situation is extremely serious. The government is unwilling to accept any binding terms. (8th Reuters dispatch)

(Tokyo) A foreign journalist asked Minister of War Itagaki today whether the resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov would affect Soviet foreign policy. Itagaki replied that, in his opinion, the Soviet government believed that Litvinov had gone too far. Litvinov resigned for this reason. Therefore, the Soviet Union will now sit on the fence to fish in troubled waters and will not support any group. (8th Reuters dispatch)

### Rumors of German-Russian Rapprochement Circulate in Berlin Another Divisive Tactic

(Berlin) Today, Berlin political circles are rife with rumors that Germany and the Soviet Union may reconcile. This theory began to circulate after Litvinov resigned as People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. However, the most reliable National Socialist Party believes that this theory is merely speculation, but they do not believe that Germany and the Soviet Union have no possibility of improving relations. (8th Associated Press dispatch)

(Berlin) Soviet Ambassador to Germany Merekalov departed for his country half a month ago. On the eve of his departure, he visited German Foreign Secretary Weizsäcker. As a result, rumors are circulating here that the Soviet Union and Germany may be approaching each other, and both sides have decided to expand the scope of the current commercial treaty. All of this seems to be propaganda by interested parties, intended to cause unease in Poland and Western European countries. German political figures at the time were quite pleased, but now they no longer talk about this and are concerned about the Soviet Union forming an agreement with Western European countries. It can be seen from the decision of Italy and Germany to sign a military and political treaty that these countries fear the formation of an agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union.

### German Navy Conducts Exercises in Danish Waters Some Warships Still in the Mediterranean

There are now 103 schools in the province, with 13,000 students. (7th Tass dispatch)

I have already visited Latvia and Estonia in Germany, and I should visit Poland to fulfill diplomatic etiquette. (8th Havas dispatch)

Warsaw General Raštikis, Commander-in-Chief of the Lithuanian Army, is scheduled to visit here tomorrow. According to Polish observers, General Raštikis's trip is to hold talks with General Smigly-Rydz, Director of Military Education of the Polish Army. Germany's intention is to encircle Poland through the Baltic Sea countries, so Poland and Lithuania must discuss countermeasures and discuss ways of cooperation in wartime. General Raštikis will also visit Polish armories. The supply of military aircraft and weapons to Lithuania by Poland will also be discussed. Poland is currently actively building high-speed bombers in large numbers, which can be sold to Central European and Baltic Sea countries in addition to domestic military use. (8th Havas dispatch)

(Berlin) The Eisen National Daily, the mouthpiece of Aviation Minister Göring, revealed a surprising piece of news today, saying that Poland had previously expressed its willingness to give up the Polish Corridor, but on the condition of acquiring Lithuania. Germany was unwilling to sacrifice Lithuania in exchange for the Corridor, so it rejected the proposal. As for rumors that Germany intended to use Poland to establish an independent Ukrainian state, the newspaper denounced it as complete fabrication. (8th Haitong dispatch)

(Moscow) Government insiders recently commented on the political and military nature of the German-Italian public, stating that the countries already had an alliance relationship in military terms. This matter is only legally confirmed and will not have any impact on the international situation. The intention is probably to respond to the firm attitude of Western European countries with intimidating tactics. (7th Havas dispatch)

Warsaw According to information received here, the Soviet government has recently appointed Dekanozov, the former party secretary of the Caucasus Province, as the Second Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. The First Deputy People's Commissar is Potemkin. (8th Haitong dispatch)

### The Danzig Question: England Willing to Mediate; This Issue Was Discussed Before Guarantees; Chamberlain Praises Polish Foreign Minister's Declaration

(London) During the House of Commons meeting this afternoon, Morgan, a Labour Party member of the opposition, inquired whether the dispute between Poland and Germany over the Danzig issue could be submitted to international arbitration. Foreign Office Under-Secretary Butler replied, "The current legal status of the Free City of Danzig is stipulated by the Treaty of Versailles. Any changes to it should be agreed upon by the countries most concerned. Our government has repeatedly expressed that international disputes should be resolved through friendly negotiations, arbitration, or other peaceful means. If any of the countries concerned request our country to mediate on the Danzig issue, we will be happy to do so." Labour Party member Henderson then inquired about the recent speech by Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "Foreign Minister Beck's words were firm yet conciliatory, which is fortunate." (All members cheered.) Another Labour Party member, Johnston, further inquired whether the government had advised the Polish government to conduct negotiations with Germany when offering guarantees to Poland. "If the German government puts forward reasonable proposals at this time, hoping to find a fair solution to the Danzig issue, British public opinion would very much like Poland to accept them. I wonder if Prime Minister Chamberlain can convey this intention to the Polish government." Prime Minister Chamberlain replied again, "Mr. Johnston must have read Foreign Minister Beck's speech (May 5th). He should know that the Danzig issue had been submitted for discussion by Germany and Poland before our country provided guarantees to Poland. Our government hopes that it will be resolved in a friendly manner. The Polish government is also well aware that our public opinion must be taken into account. This is an important point, and the Polish government also sees this, there is no doubt about it," (Havas, 8th)

### Germany Hopes Poland Will Consider at Length; Claims Unity with Italy

(Berlin) The Frankfurter Zeitung claims that Germany has given Poland and the Western countries time for lengthy consideration, hoping they will use it. Hitler's proposals regarding the Polish issue have received Italy's full support. Poland's firm demand for free access to the Baltic Sea is not opposed by Germany. Germany's proposals have not refuted this. (Reuters, 8th)

### Romanian Foreign Minister to Visit Turkey on Schedule

### Hungarian Prime Minister Reiterates Treaty Revision Demands; Maintains Amicable Relations with Germany and Italy

The Hungarian capital: Following the dissolution of the House of Representatives, a re-election is scheduled for the 28th of this month. President Teleki delivered a campaign speech yesterday, stating, "All ethnic groups that have been under Austro-Hungarian rule should be allowed to establish the political organization they need according to their own wishes. This principle also applies to the Slovak people." "Our country's demand to revise the Treaty of Trianon is not new. This demand has not yet been fulfilled. Although our country has recovered the Carpathian Ukraine province, this is the result of the disintegration of Czechoslovakia and cannot be regarded as achieving the goal of revising the treaty. Regarding our country's relations with the Axis countries, they are very good. Our country maintains the greatest amity with Germany and Italy, and both Germany and Italy recognize our country's important position in the Danube region. Moreover, Germany is our country's largest customer for products, and our country's economy should adapt to this reality. Regarding national defense issues, our country's military reorganization plan was originally scheduled to be completed in five years, and it should now be accelerated to complete it ahead of schedule." (Havas, 8th)

### Internal Strife in Yugoslavia; Croatian Autonomy Agreement Not Approved by Regency

Zagreb: Regarding the issue of Croatian autonomy, an agreement was previously reached between Prime Minister Cvetković and Croatian leader Maček, but it was not approved by Prince Paul, the First Regent. Maček therefore convened a meeting of one hundred representatives of various opposition parties of the Croatian ethnic group at nine o'clock this morning to discuss countermeasures. The meeting adjourned at 12:45 PM and was scheduled to continue at 5:00 PM in the afternoon. During the meeting, a conflict suddenly broke out among the crowd outside the venue, followed by a brawl. A young man opened fire with a pistol, and a member of a Croatian military-style group was shot and injured. It is not yet clear whether the shooter was a member of the government party or a separatist from the Croatian ethnic group. It is reported that the Croatian representatives are deeply dissatisfied with the failure of Maček's negotiations with the government authorities, so it is possible that they will put forward a radical resolution at the meeting to oppose the government authorities. If so, Maček will feel thorny. (Havas, 8th)

### British Air Force General Secretly Arrives in France

(London) Major General Alexander, commander of the First Division of the British Air Force, left for Paris on the night of the 6th with several senior air force officers. Because all parties kept the matter secret, the news was only revealed in today's newspapers. It is difficult to ascertain the purpose of the visit to France by the senior British air force officers. It is said that when Major General Alexander and his party flew to Paris, General Blancard, the air force commander of Bourget Airport, and Colonel Durenne, commander of the French Air Force Base No. 194, were at the airport to welcome them.

### German African Party Opposes National Socialism; Declares Maintenance of Freedom

Windhoek: The German African Party of Southwest Africa is organized by naturalized Germans, mostly German veterans. The entire party opposes the National Socialist system. The party issued a statement today calling on South Africans to firmly maintain freedom. The statement said that Hitler not only wants Southwest Africa, but also needs South Africa to restore the inflated German finances. The party is very surprised by the shortsighted attitude of some of the federal people of Southwest and South Africa towards the current situation in Europe and Africa. South Africans must remember that rights and justice were the supreme law of the former Germany. The statement also said that if the Hitler system would bring blessings to our homeland, we should of course not fight it. The principle embraced by the German African Party is freedom and lasting freedom. (Reuters, 7th)

### German-Italian Military Alliance to Be Signed in Berlin; Mussolini to Go in Person; Italian King to Visit Berlin as Well

(Berlin) According to reliable sources, the German-Italian military and political treaty concluded by the German and Italian foreign ministers in Milan yesterday will be signed in Berlin in a few weeks. At that time, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will visit Berlin for this purpose and sign this alliance with Hitler on behalf of Italy. The text of the treaty is currently being carefully drafted. (Haitong, 8th)

(Rome) The Messenger reports that the German-Italian political and military treaty will be signed in early June. (Havas, 8th)

Como, Italy: After Foreign Minister Ciano and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop agreed on a political and military treaty in Milan this afternoon, they traveled by car to this city and attended a grand banquet at the Villa d'Este. Crowds gathered on the streets to cheer and pay their respects. Foreign Minister Ciano will return to Rome tonight to report the progress to Prime Minister Mussolini. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will return to Berlin tomorrow evening or early the day after tomorrow. (Havas, 7th)

(Berlin) Chancellor Hitler visited Italy last May. It is rumored here that King Emmanuel III will visit Germany on the 28th of this month to return the visit. (Havas, 7th)

### Japanese Attitude

(Tokyo) Today, all newspapers here published the news of the signing of the German-Italian military agreement with large headlines, but since the news only arrived in Tokyo at 2:00 AM this morning, no editorials have been published. A foreign newspaper reporter asked the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman to express his opinion on the agreement. The spokesman replied that strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact is Japan's unchanging policy. The reporter asked whether the Anti-Comintern Pact would be related to the military agreement. The spokesman declined to answer this. The reporter then asked Minister of War Itagaki whether Japan had the possibility of joining the German-Italian military agreement. Itagaki replied that the spirit of promoting the Tripartite Anti-Comintern Pact is deeply rooted, so if Germany and Italy are willing to have it, Japan may as well conclude a military agreement with the Axis powers. Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso said that, according to what he heard, negotiations on the conclusion of a military agreement between Germany, Italy, and Japan are clearly in progress. However, according to his personal observation, whether this negotiation can be realized depends entirely on whether Germany and Italy understand Japan's position and power in East Asia and their own situation in Europe. Cooperation between Japan and Germany and Italy to implement its national policy will naturally feel convenient. But if Germany and Italy attempt to implement their national policies in the environment of the encirclement policy implemented by their enemies, without seeking the full cooperation of Japan, the largest power in East Asia, it will not only be inconvenient but also dangerous. Koiso also expressed his opinion, saying that misunderstandings arise when there is a lack of understanding. It would be fortunate for Germany, Italy, and Japan if the two countries had a full and correct understanding of Japan's position and power in East Asia and their own situation in Europe. Japanese people mostly know more about Germany and German events than Germans know about Japan and Japanese events. (Reuters, 8th)

(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman met with reporters today and answered Japan's attitude towards the German-Italian military alliance, saying that Japan's main purpose is to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact. Regarding whether Japan will sign a military alliance with other anti-communist countries, the spokesman avoided answering, only saying that Japan believes that the Anti-Comintern Pact is the best tool for maintaining amicable relations with Germany and Italy. (Haitong, 8th)

(Tokyo) Japanese Minister of War Itagaki met with a Haitong News Agency reporter today and issued a statement, saying that the conclusion of the German-Italian military and political alliance is a congratulatory event. The unity of the two countries will become more solid in the future, thereby eliminating the unease in Europe and establishing a new order in Europe. Itagaki continued, "The chaos in Europe today is due to the inability of the old powers and the emerging powers to maintain balance." The reporter asked whether Japan would also join this alliance. Itagaki replied that, in terms of the spirit of anti-communism, this matter is not necessarily impossible. Finally, the reporter asked whether the rumored Soviet Russian Far East military strength is very strong and is a threat to the Far East. Itagaki replied yes. (Hai Dian, 8th)

### American Observation: Japan Increasingly Isolated

(Washington) Diplomats here today speculate that the German-Italian military alliance may isolate Japan, forcing Japan to develop closer relations with Western democracies. Experts who have recently studied Japanese-American and British-Japanese commercial relations also believe that if Japan develops close ties with Germany and Italy, it will be economically extremely fragile. In 1937, Britain and the United States supplied Japan with 3.8% of important military needs, while Italy provided almost no assistance to Japan. (Associated Press, 7th)

### Former British Consul General in Hankou, Sir Goffe, Passes Away

(London) Sir Goffe, the former British Consul General in Hankou, China, passed away at his private residence here yesterday at the age of sixty-nine. Goffe went to China in 1890 as a trainee interpreter and was promoted several times. In 1911, he served as Acting Consul General in Hankou. The following year, he served as Consul General in Yunnan Prefecture. In 1920, he was transferred to Consul General in Hankou. In February 1927, the British returned the Hankou British Concession to the Chinese Nationalist Government, which was during the tenure of Sir Goffe. (Havas, 8th)

### Conflicts Erupt Again on the Border of Mongolia and the Puppet State

(Tokyo) According to news received here, a serious conflict occurred on the border between "Manchukuo" and Mongolia today. It is said that 50 Mongolian soldiers opened fire on 16 border soldiers and 6 policemen of "Manchukuo." The "Manchu" army "returned fire," and the fierce battle lasted for five hours. As a result, at least three Mongolian soldiers were killed. As for the "Manchu" army, Chang Fang claimed that there were no casualties. (Haitong, 8th)

### Different Perspectives on the German-Italian Alliance; Germany and Italy See It as a Natural Result; Britain and France Say International Tendencies Have Not Changed; Poland Believes International Status Weakened

(Rome) The Italian "People's Voice" reported that political figures were not surprised by the formal alliance between Italy and Germany, as its significance lies in indicating that there has been no change in the understanding between the two countries. However, it is believed that after the establishment of this alliance, Italy has accepted open constraints and is stronger than before. The mouthpiece of the Italian Foreign Minister reported that Italy and Germany have recognized that each has its own sphere of interest, Italy being the entire Mediterranean, and Germany being the Baltic Sea and Central European region. Each country is engaged in realizing its responsibilities in a spirit of complete autonomy and does not strictly force one party to provide assistance, but only provides convenience. However, there is one thing that the relationship between each other is strong and consistent, that is, the war of principles. Both countries are determined on this because they both know that the failure of one side is the collapse of the other side. (Reuters, 7th)

(Rome) People here point out that German and Italian military and staff officers have long been in contact, such as General Göring's visit to Rome, Baliani's visit to Berlin, Baliani's meeting with General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces, in Innsbruck on April 5th and 6th, and General Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, visiting Italy, all of which are related to this matter. (Haitong, 8th)

(Berlin) Political figures here do not express surprise at the conclusion of the German-Italian military and political alliance in Milan, because they believe that the cooperation of the Axis countries has long been so close that neither side doubts the attitude the other will take under any circumstances. The form of this decision is only to make those who generally promote the incompatibility of German and Italian opinions break down on their own. It is decided that this alliance is defensive in nature and its purpose is to deal with the "aggressive" encirclement policy launched by Britain. This policy has been confirmed by the speech of the Polish Foreign Minister, so this alliance is a natural result of the European situation. (Haitong, 8th)

Warsaw: Officials here refuse to comment on the German-Italian political and military agreement pending further news, but believe that Poland's international position in any negotiations on Danzig has been weakened by this agreement. According to non-official sources, Italy was not willing to sign this agreement and was forced to do so because it did not want to see a conflict in Europe over Danzig. At the same time, it is also believed that Mussolini seemed to have obtained a mild guarantee from Germany before agreeing to sign this agreement. Newspaper editorials all believe that the time has now come for Germany to decide the future of Polish-German relations. The Polish government newspaper hopes that Germany will choose a peaceful path and begin negotiations based on the basic conditions put forward by Polish Foreign Minister Beck. (Reuters, 7th)

Warsaw: The military and political treaties agreed upon by Germany and Italy are currently being commented on by observers here. Poland should negotiate with Lithuania and try to keep Hungary neutral in order to avoid German encirclement. (Havas, 8th)

London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that London is not at all surprised by the German-Italian political and military agreement showing the Axis relationship. However, officials do not want to criticize it until they know the details of the scope of the agreement. London observers say that, as far as Italy is concerned, this agreement can determine Germany's military status. There are two points discussed in diplomatic circles: one is the impact on Italy's neutrality under certain circumstances, and the other is Germany's relationship with the Mediterranean and North Africa. (Reuters, 7th)

(London) After Germany and Italy decided to sign a political and military treaty, members of parliament here commented that the idea of Germany, Italy, and Japan signing a military alliance has always been opposed by Japan. Now that Germany and Italy have established this treaty, it may induce Japan to change its original intention, which is not necessarily the case. The main purpose of Germany and Italy in doing this is to respond to the efforts of Britain and France to organize an anti-aggression group. But in practice, the current situation has not changed in any way as a result. German and Italian staff officers have repeatedly held talks recently. General Göring, the German Minister of Aviation, even went to inspect the defenses of Italian Libya in North Africa. Their close military cooperation is not new and can be seen from this. It is hoped that Italy can maintain neutrality in wartime, but now it is hopeless. (Havas, 7th)

(Paris) Well-informed sources here believe that the German-Italian political and military alliance cannot change the situation, and believe that the communique issued in Milan focuses on political demonstrations to warn the democracies that the Berlin-Rome axis has not weakened. The "Paris Times" reported that, in view of various circumstances, it makes people think that Mussolini cannot escape Germany's control due to policy errors. At the same time, it is even believed that Italy will continue to try to persuade Germany not to be too stubborn towards Poland. (Reuters, 7th)

(Paris) After Germany and Italy decided to sign a political and military agreement, responsible French officials declared that this move only confirms the long-existing facts with diplomatic documents and wants to psychologically influence the countries of Central Europe and the Balkans. The international situation has not changed as a result. (Havas, 7th)

(New York) After Germany and Italy decided to sign a political and military treaty, the New York Public Forum commented that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini would ask Germany not to overdo it with Poland and only exercise diplomatic pressure to avoid bloodshed. However, one thing must be known, that is, the victory won in diplomacy is often more brutal than the victory won on the battlefield. The past events of Austria and Czechoslovakia can serve as a warning. (Havas, 8th)

(Moscow) The newspapers published the news of the Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Potemkin's return from Turkey, calling him "the First Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs." Potemkin will become the assistant of the new Commissar Molotov. From this, it can be seen that the newspapers all praised the results of Potemkin's talks with Turkish officials, saying that they can make the joint strike between the two sides closer. In addition, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union is scheduled to meet on the 25th of this month, and the newspapers attach great importance to it. (Havas, 7th)

### Italian Side Reports: Germany Offers Guarantee Not to Use Force Against Poland

Milan: Well-informed sources here have declared that Germany has provided a guarantee to Italy, stating that it will never use violence to enforce its demands on Poland. In other words, it will not place a fait accompli before Italy. This is the condition for Italy's agreement to sign a political and military treaty. Although Italy has been cooperating with Germany militarily for a long time, it has never expressed support for the idea of formally concluding an alliance treaty. After Germany repeatedly made representations, it always treated them with a cold attitude. Now that it has finally agreed to sign this type of treaty, it is because it sincerely hopes that the issue of the Free City of Danzig can be resolved peacefully. It can be seen that in order to make Italy accept this treaty, Germany has had to abandon its grand plan for the Free City of Danzig. (Havas, 7th)

### Situation of Japanese Aircraft Bombing Shantou; Ten Japanese Warships Arrive Along the Chaoshan Coast

Shantou Correspondence: Recently, the Japanese army has been making every effort to attack the Siyi region of the Xijiang River, while also increasing troops from Taiwan to Guangdong, attempting to attack the Chaoshan coast and contain the Chinese army counterattacking the Dongbei River area. Five Japanese warships were originally stationed outside Mayu Port in Shantou, dispersed in the waters of Chenghai, Raoping, and Chaoyang. On the 28th, five more warships suddenly arrived, stationed at Daya Bay in Haifeng County, Jieshi in Lufeng County, Dahao River Dumen in Chaoyang County, outside Mayu Port in Shantou City, and the North and South Ports of Chenghai County. On the 27th, a Japanese cruiser outside Mayu Port dispatched a seaplane to bomb Shantou. The entire city of Shantou was under air raid alerts all day. The first bombs dropped by the Japanese aircraft fell near Tongji North Road, but all four landed in the water. Two bombs did not explode, only injuring one elderly woman. At 9:30 AM, the aircraft flew again to the Wujiao area, dropping four bombs. This area is a depot district, with the grain depot of the China Southern Rice Industry Company located there. At that time, two warehouses were destroyed. Residents fled into air raid shelters and were fortunate to be safe. At 10:20 AM, the Japanese aircraft flew into the city again, continuously dropping bombs on Wujiao and Tongji Road, destroying over ten civilian houses. The Liangmao Soybean Oil Factory was destroyed, resulting in seven casualties, both men and women. The purpose of this bombing by the Japanese aircraft seemed to be the Guanghua Wharf Match Factory, as the factory was in the process of manufacturing, employing over a thousand workers. The plan was to turn the raw materials into finished goods and then dismantle the machinery to set up a factory in Xingning. The main purpose was to threaten the residents. The Chaoshan Garrison Headquarters, feeling that the situation was becoming increasingly serious, intensified the forced evacuation of residents, ordering the police stations and neighborhood chiefs to persuade people to move from house to house. Those unable to move were given free boat and vehicle tickets issued by the police district. These tickets were only valid for travel to Chaozhou, Jieyang, Fengshun, and Meizhou, and not back to Shantou. Starting from the 29th, when police districts went door-to-door to persuade people, free boat and vehicle tickets were issued according to the number of people in the household, asking where they wanted to go and specifying which boat or vehicle they were allowed to board, with a one-time use limit. The ticket specified the valid time. It was also heard here on the evening of the 28th that the Japanese warship stationed in Haifeng landed over a hundred soldiers at Magong in Shanwei at 3:00 PM. The local militia immediately rushed to meet them in battle. Seeing that they were prepared, the Japanese soldiers immediately retreated back to the ship, burning five fishermen's cottages and plundering many pigs, chickens, and ducks before leaving. On the 29th, the citizens of Shantou knew that war was inevitable. All factories and shops were closed, with only three or five teahouses operating as usual. Military police patrolled the streets to maintain order. The men, women, old, and young leaving Shantou carried clothing and belongings, walking along the roads. At this time, the Chaoyang-Jieyang ferry no longer operated on a fixed schedule, departing when full. Passengers bought tickets and boarded the ship at any time, not allowed to rush for seats.

### Yangcheng: Broadsword Brigade Ambush Japanese Personnel

Japanese Army Trains Scoundrels as Spies

Yangzhou Correspondence: At 5:00 PM on the 28th, a member of the Japanese pacification team was ambushed and killed by a broadsword brigade in a deserted village six or seven li away from Liuwei. The body was also taken away by the broadsword brigade. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese army in Yangcheng was terrified. A curfew was imposed in Yangzhou that night, and the electric lights in Yangcheng were not turned off all night. Also, at dawn on the 28th, the Chinese People's Service Corps burned a section of the Xiannvmiao Erdaoqiao bridge and captured three puppet soldiers. Furthermore, at 11:00 PM on the 28th, the Chinese army attacked Xiannvmiao Sanyuanqiao and Hongqiao in two routes. The Japanese army at Xiannvmiao panicked and randomly fired machine guns at the Chinese army lying in ambush. During the two-hour engagement with the Japanese army, the Japanese side consumed a large amount of ammunition. Subsequently, the Chinese army safely returned to their defenses after their mission was accomplished.

The Japanese Army Headquarters in Yangzhou recently recruited a group of opium addicts, totaling thirty-seven, for training. They are all middle-aged scoundrels in their thirties. The training is now complete. They are divided into groups of three or five and dispersed to Chinese army positions and Gaoyou, Taixian, and other places to act as spies. Each traitor is given two new-style explosives, hidden on their person, intending to cause trouble. They have passwords and secret signals when they are active. Traces of them have already been found near Zhaoguan Dam. The Chinese military and political authorities are closely monitoring them.

### Northern Guangdong Province: Chinese Army Gathers to Prepare for General Offensive; Fierce Competition for Xinshi Consumes Much of the Japanese Army; Japanese Reinforcements are in a Difficult Situation

Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the Chinese army launched the initial stage of the counteroffensive in northern Guangdong, they have successively recovered Conghua, Huaxian, and Xinshi, advancing to Guotang and controlling the Jiangcun area. The Japanese army in Guangzhou has also revealed its state of panic. However, the Chinese army's current advance is still localized. The full-scale general counteroffensive is yet to come. Here is a record of the battle situation in the past ten days.

Second Recovery of Xinshi

At the beginning of the counteroffensive, the troops of the Li Division of the Group Army advanced south from the front of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway and attacked Xinshi. The Japanese army in Xinshi, caught off guard by the sudden Chinese army attack, fought in a panic, lacking morale, and were eventually defeated by the Chinese army. The Chinese army then recovered Xinshi. Xinshi is of great importance to the future of the war. If Xinshi is obtained, the southern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway will be no different from being under control. Militarily, it is a must-win place. The Japanese commander Ando immediately drew more than a thousand Japanese troops from Guangzhou and, starting on April 20th, launched a counterattack on Xinshi in three routes. In order to lure the enemy, the Chinese army quickly withdrew from Xinshi, setting a trap to wait and cause the Japanese army to consume as much as possible. That night, the two armies engaged in a fierce battle at Letong in Xinshi. After nightfall, the central route of the Chinese army approached the Xinshi railway station. The fighting was fierce and protracted, with gains and losses of strongholds like a tug-of-war. The left and right wings of the Chinese army took advantage of the darkness to advance and detour. Until the morning of the 21st, they suddenly launched an attack from the side, encircling Xinshi from three directions. In addition to the central route already close to the Japanese position, one route came from behind the station, and another route came from near Hengtan. The Chinese artillery also bombarded the Japanese positions, destroying the Japanese fortifications. The Chinese army then resolutely attacked Xinshi again. The Japanese army fled south along the railway, escaping to Jiangcun via Guotang, suffering three to four hundred casualties. After the Chinese army recovered Xinshi, in the afternoon, they took advantage of the victory to pursue, advancing towards Guotang. After the Japanese army retreated from Xinshi, most of them fled to Jiangcun, but some gathered at Guotang. When the Chinese army advanced near Guotang, the Japanese army counterattacked but soon fled. The area nearby was then occupied by the Chinese army, and the Jiangcun area was controlled.

Frequent Engagements on the Front Lines

After the Chinese army recovered Xinshi again, they established a strong defense to prevent the Japanese army from recapturing it. They immediately pursued the retreating Japanese army, clearing the remnants. Therefore, fierce battles took place in Xin Village, Hengtan, Changgang, and along the Guanghua Road, Longxiang, and Longkou Village. Many Japanese soldiers were annihilated. The Japanese army, now trapped in Longkou Village, still has over a thousand people, putting up a desperate fight. The Chinese army on the railway front is continuing to advance, maintaining vigilance in the Guotang and Shilongxu areas.

Since the Chinese army recovered Conghua, they have been attacking towards Shangang. On the evening of the 24th, the Liang Division attacked Shangang at night, annihilating dozens of Japanese soldiers. It is said that the Japanese army has suffered continuous heavy blows from the Chinese army over the past month, with more than half of their casualties, and their strength is very weak. Therefore, they have shortened the surrounding defense lines and tightly secured their camps. It has been learned that the areas west of Shangang, such as Mianya Cliff, Jiulian Tomb, and Mayazhuang, used to be frequently harassed by Japanese infantry and cavalry, looting grain. Recently, the Chinese army has established a strong front line in the area of Aotou Shiqian City, tightly controlling the Japanese army, so the Japanese army no longer dares to send troops to harass. The above-mentioned areas are as peaceful as usual. Also, on the 26th, some of the Japanese army in Shangang retreated towards Taipingchang with food, military supplies, and equipment, with unclear intentions. The Wang Regiment of a certain division of the Chinese army in Huaxian has been pressing south along the Guanghua Line towards Xilong Pingshan for days. The Japanese army guarding this area is the remnants of the Fujii and Watanabe units. Fearing an attack by the Chinese army, they are moving around erratically. On the 24th and 25th, over two hundred Japanese infantry and cavalry, accompanied by a small artillery unit, sneaked into Pingshan. The Chinese army's attacking team then launched a surprise attack on the Japanese army late at night on the 26th, encircling and annihilating them in several routes. The Japanese army stubbornly resisted, relying on the terrain, but their strength gradually waned. Then, the Japanese army in Longkou Village, upon hearing the news, immediately rushed to reinforce in armored vehicles. A certain battalion of the Chinese army's fresh troops also joined the battle at this time. The battle situation was fierce. The Chinese army bravely charged, stepping into the Japanese positions. The Japanese army was defeated in a panic, retreating into the market town and being trapped. More than twenty Japanese soldiers were killed by the Chinese army, and more than ten long and short guns and several war horses were seized. It was not until dawn that the Chinese army voluntarily withdrew to their original positions.

The Chan-Tan line on the left wing of the Chinese army has also made progress in the past week. The Li Division troops of the Group Army have been pressing towards Tanbu from the direction of Chibaini. Only a little over a hundred Japanese troops are stationed there. On the morning of the 27th, the Chinese artillery first launched an attack on the Japanese army, firing five or sixty shells in succession. Many shells hit, destroying the Japanese fortifications. A battalion of the Chinese army took the opportunity to charge at the Japanese army. The Japanese army was weak and was defeated in one battle, retreating towards Fengyong. The Chinese army captured many prisoners. By noon, the Japanese army in the Tanbu area had retreated south one after another. The Chinese army is pursuing them in the middle of the pursuit.

Chinese Army Gathers for General Offensive

Currently, the Chinese army is stationed with heavy troops between Xinshi and Letong, confronting the Japanese army retreating to Jiangcun and Guotang. The main force of the Group Army is gathering at Juntian, Yinzhan'ao, and other places. At the same time, they are closely coordinating with guerrilla units in various places. Commander Zhang Fakui and Yu Hanmou will readjust the various armies and inspect the front lines. Once the time for the general offensive arrives, they will give the Japanese army an even greater blow.

Japanese Army Rapidly Reinforces

The Japanese army in the Jiangbei position has been repeatedly annihilated by the Chinese army, so they have transferred troops stationed in Guangzhou and the suburbs to reinforce the northern Guangdong area, resulting in a significant reduction of Japanese troops in Guangzhou. The so-called maintaining of治安is only carried out by a small number of Japanese military police and puppet self-defense forces. As for their reinforcement situation, it has been learned that thousands of troops have been suddenly added to the Taipingchang, Shangang, Qiangang, and Zhongluotan areas in the past week, totaling ten thousand people including the previous troops. They are forcing civilians to build barracks and ammunition depots in Shiling and other places in Taipingchang, and they are also ordering two able-bodied men to be drawn from each village in nearby villages and formed into the South China Plainclothes Advance Team. Furthermore, the original 400 Japanese troops stationed in Shangang have been transferred to Shiling to reinforce. There are now over a thousand Japanese troops in Shiling. A certain unit of the Group Army of the Chinese army has surrounded the Japanese army in Shiling, waiting for an opportunity to annihilate them. As for the Japanese army in the Jiangcun area, they are also forcing the people to build many more fortresses, attempting to defend to the death.

### Bai Chongxi Inspects Zhejiang

Bai is Extremely Optimistic About the Future of the War Against Japan

Yongkang Correspondence: Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Military Affairs Commission, arrived in Zhejiang from Jiangxi the day before yesterday to inspect the military affairs of the various war zones under his command. Those who came with him included Chen Yi, Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, He Sui, Chairman of the Military Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan, and others. Huang Shaohong, Liu Jianxu, and others personally went to greet them.

He also spoke freely about the war situation to visitors. He also gave a considerable explanation of the construction of our country's land and air forces, believing that Japan will never have the ability to increase troops in China again. He is extremely optimistic about the future of the war against Japan. Bai has now transferred to a certain place for inspection. (April 20th)

### Jiaxing: Japanese Army Conscription is Busy

There is a Fierce Battle at Jiaoshanmen Bridge

Jiaxing Correspondence: The Japanese army, due to the active guerrilla warfare on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, has transferred Japanese troops from Shanghai and Hangzhou to concentrate in Hecheng, attempting to respond with Hecheng as the general supply station, controlling the Sujia and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. Therefore, Jiaxing has been full of Japanese soldiers in recent days. On the 5th, two thousand soldiers from the Ishikawa and Yamamoto units were dispatched to Huangwan, Ganpu, Jiaoliyan, Changchuanba, and other places, forcing the people to rush to build highways and bridges. The Haiyan Puppet County Office was established in Ganpu, with Yu Sen as the chief of the police station. Three hundred Japanese soldiers also arrived in Xinzuan Town. The Jiaoshanmen Bridge, the end point of the Jiashan-Jiaoshan Highway (Jiaxing County boundary), has been the site of fierce battles between the Japanese army and the Chinese army under Jiang Bu, Wu Liangbi, Shen Guangming, and others since the 6th. The sound of artillery fire continued all night.

### Great Chaos in Yixing

Zang Licheng Flees to Wuxi

Wuxi Correspondence: The four suburbs of Yixing have recently been controlled by the Chinese army. The Chinese army once stormed into the city, and many bridges on the Xiyi Highway were also destroyed. The Japanese army stationed at Heqiao and Caoqiao rushed to Yixing to help, and fierce battles broke out with the Chinese army. In the great chaos in Yixing City, the puppet magistrate Zang Licheng has fled to Wuxi, not daring to go to Yixing.

### Guerilla War Occurs in Meili, Changshu

Changshu Correspondence: The Dongxiang guerrilla unit under Ren Tianshi has been quite active recently.

Civilian houses in Meili were destroyed, and more than a hundred people were left homeless.

Education News

### Guizhou Province Develops Special Ethnic Education

14,000 Yuan Allocated This Year; Special Teacher Training Classes Established

(Guilin Special Dispatch) According to statistics from the Guangxi Provincial Government, there are over 300,000 people from special ethnic groups within the province, namely the Yao, Miao, Lao, Guo, Ling, Tong, Nong, and Sheng Nong tribes, distributed in over 60 counties, scattered in deep mountains and poor valleys, with a very low level of culture. In recent years, the provincial government has been actively seeking to develop their education. In 29 townships and 1,026 villages where special ethnic groups are scattered, 36 central national basic schools have been established by township, and 62 national basic schools have been established by village. This year, 14,000 yuan has been added to the annual budget as subsidies, and special teacher training classes have been attached to the Donglan Fengshan Tian'e Joint National Middle School, making it easier for children from special ethnic groups in the northwest to attend school.

### The Ministry of Education Continues to Hold the Middle School Graduation Joint Examination Trend (II)

Does the Joint Examination Hinder Youth Health? (The example of the Beijing Municipal Elementary School Joint Examination shows that although some students lost weight, others gained weight. The factors contributing to weight loss include climate, diet, sleep, and illness, and cannot be solely attributed to the joint examination. The original text also discusses other aspects, which are omitted for brevity.) Discussion of Improvement. So, is the joint examination free of serious malpractices? That is not the case. The situation of the aforementioned elementary schools in former Beiping, where the joint examination increased the workload, may still be prevalent in middle schools across the country today. Even if the subjects in the joint examination have been reduced, schools cannot avoid additionally increasing the teaching hours for the subjects in the joint examination. Why? The courses for Chinese History and Chinese Geography are completed in the second grade, while the courses for Foreign History, Foreign Geography, Mathematics, and Chemistry are not started until the last semester. However, most or part of the courses were completed long ago. It is not easy to lightly mention examinations for these past subjects and courses without a period of review. Moreover, schools with poor performance are aware that they have neglected teaching in the past. Without reviewing, there is no way to take the exam. Those with excellent performance also feel that it is difficult to win without reviewing. As a result, the learning burden of young people suddenly increases, and their health is harmed. Why wait until the joint examination is held? Some suggest that the way to correct this is to limit the subjects and the amount of coursework in the joint examination to those in the last semester, without tracing back to the past. This is indeed a good plan for the joint examination. However, what about those who must take the entire course in the entrance examination after graduation? Moreover, the scope of the graduation examination is the level of graduation, while the entrance examination even exceeds the level of graduation. The difficulty is far above the problem of the joint examination. If the entrance examination and the graduation joint examination cannot be connected and merged, then those who are exempt from the joint examination cannot be exempt from the entrance examination. What is the value of this temporary exemption, and why gather all the difficulties afterward? Last year, the Ministry held a unified enrollment for all public universities nationwide. Students with excellent results in the provincial joint examination were exempted from the entrance examination. This was only a temporary incentive method. In the future, we should thoroughly seek a reform of the system, or, like France, strictly implement the middle school graduation joint examination and directly exempt the university entrance examination.

As for the joint examination, there are many technical issues that should continue to be improved, such as the oral examination, the way of formulating questions, the scope of topics, and the time for supplementary examinations. All of this depends on objective attitude and thorough discussion. (End)

### Su Education Director Ma Yuanfang Talks About the Entire Picture of Education in Jiangsu Province After the War (Part 1): Changes in Provincial and County Education Administrative Organizations and a General Overview of the Work of Implementing Anti-Japanese Education

(Taixian Correspondence) Jiangsu Education Director Ma Yuanfang recently published the situation of education in Jiangsu after the war as follows: In the past, the education industry in Jiangsu Province was the most developed province in the country's education industry. In addition to the two cities of Shanghai and Nanjing, there were eight colleges and universities, 41 provincial secondary schools, 33 provincial primary schools and compulsory experimental areas, 14 provincial social education institutions, 68 county secondary schools, and 106 private secondary schools. It is estimated that there were more than 1,000 classes in secondary schools, accommodating more than 50,000 secondary school students. There were more than 8,000 county primary schools and junior primary schools in each county, with a total of more than 15,000 classes, accommodating more than 750,000 primary school students (the above figures are from the 25th year and do not include compulsory classes). The total amount of the provincial education budget in the 26th year was more than 6.4 million yuan, and the total amount of the county education budget was more than 11.2 million yuan. The prosperity of the industry can be said to be unique. Since the War of Resistance against Japan and the fall of Jiangsu Province into the war zone, the scope of the war was initially in a corner of Shanghai and Shanghai, and then expanded to the north and south of the Yangtze River. The educational institutions of Jiangsu Province were either bombed or burned. The amount of the loss is difficult to count. However, our country's strength in the War of Resistance and the spirit of building the country through resistance are increasing day by day. Under the difficult struggle of the military and political authorities in northern Jiangsu, the complete organization is still maintained. Although the education industry in Jiangsu Province has undergone many changes this year, it has fortunately not been interrupted. Amidst the smoke of gunpowder, the sound of stringed instruments and songs can still be heard. This is the result of the joint efforts and hard work of the colleagues in the education sector of Jiangsu Province. Now, the recent educational situation in Jiangsu is specifically described below:

Changes in Provincial Education Administrative Institutions

The changes in the provincial education administrative organization and the internal organization of the Education Department were originally the Secretariat, the Inspection Room, the Compilation and Examination Room, the First Section (managing higher and secondary education), the Second Section (managing local education administration and elementary education), the Third Section (managing social education), and the Fourth Section (managing education funding). There was also the Education Funding Committee, the Secondary Normal Teachers Examination Committee, the Primary School Teacher Examination Committee, the Compulsory Education Committee, and the Illiteracy Elimination Education Committee to take charge of various tasks. In the spring of the 27th year, the provincial government temporarily moved to Huaiyin, and the internal organization of the department was slightly reduced. It was the Secretariat, the First Section (managing education funding), the Second Section (managing local education administration and elementary education), and the Third Section (managing secondary education). Later, the Third Section was merged into the Second Section. The most recent organization is the Secretariat, the First Section (managing education funding), the Second Section (managing education affairs), the Inspection Room, the Compilation and Examination Room, and a liaison office in Shanghai to handle all the matters related to the relocation and resumption of schools in the province. (To be continued)

### Today is the 5/9 National Humiliation Memorial, Citizens Deeply Mourn

Saving from Thrift to Relieve Refugees, Upholding the Environment and Not Flying Half-Mast

Today is the 25th anniversary of the 5/9 National Humiliation. The people of this city are fasting for a day to express their deep sorrow and using the savings to relieve refugees. In order to uphold the difficult environment, raising the flag at half-mast will be temporarily suspended. Various groups in the city have given narratives on the brief history of 5/9, which are extracted as follows: (2) On January 18, 1915, Japan presented the Twenty-One Demands to the Beijing government. On May 7 of the same year, it issued an ultimatum. Yuan Shikai, blinded by his imperial ambitions, succumbed to it and signed the agreement on this day twenty-five years ago. However, our compatriots across the country firmly opposed it. Since then, the May 30th Massacre of 1925, the Jinan Massacre of May 3, 1928, the September 18th Incident of 1931 in the Northeast, and the January 28th Incident of 1932 in Shanghai all stemmed from the evil seeds sown by the Twenty-One Demands of 5/9. Therefore, the central government has designated today as the National Humiliation Memorial Day, so that the people across the country can be vigilant. If the national humiliation is not avenged for even one day, the compatriots across the country will never have a day of peace. (2) The July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident was a complete exposure of the invasion conspiracy and the final juncture for our country to avenge the humiliation and seek survival. The central government saw this and resolutely launched a full-scale war of resistance. The President proclaimed to our people, "If we do not resist at this time, our entire nation will perish, and our descendants will forever be slaves, cattle, and horses, with no hope of recovery." Therefore, if we want to wash away the national humiliation and save the nation, we must uphold the national policy and use the Thirty-Two Articles of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction as the overall response to the Twenty-One Demands. Under this special environment, our Shanghai compatriots should be deeply vigilant, firm in their beliefs, intensify their work, be down-to-earth, work hard with their heads down, not value formality, pay attention to practicality, and gather the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the entire people for a long-term struggle. Final victory will be within our grasp.

### Rice Market Opened as Usual Yesterday, Situation Slightly More Stable

However, the seriousness of large households still buying in remains undiminished. The Evaluation Committee will hold a meeting today to strictly crack down.

Due to the manipulation of hoarders, rice prices in the Shanghai rice market have skyrocketed. Compared with the previous investigation, the current rice reserves have decreased by more than 40,000 bags. The Evaluation Committee is scheduled to convene a committee meeting today to discuss stabilization measures. Those who speculate and manipulate will be investigated and dealt with, and they will be advised not to engage in speculative rice business to avoid affecting the people's food. The Doumi Industry Association will report to the authorities of the two concessions and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Details are recorded as follows:

Market Situation Still Serious

Although the Doumi Industry Market opened as usual at 9:00 AM yesterday, the market situation was slightly more stable than the day before yesterday, but it was still very serious. Due to the price limit of 15 yuan for high-grade white japonica rice, there were no formal transactions on the market. The prices of rice in various warehouses have risen to the limit price. Although all members of the Market Committee have tried their best to persuade, the results were minimal. Large households are still buying in, resulting in a phenomenon where demand exceeds supply. This has caused those holding rice to remain on the sidelines and not sell, so the number of transactions is only about 1,000 to 2,000 bags.

Evaluation Committee Meeting to Discuss Measures

The Rice Evaluation Committee, in view of the speculative manipulation by domestic households, which has led to improper rice prices, has decided to convene the third Rice Evaluation Committee meeting at 3:00 PM this afternoon to discuss concrete measures for strict crackdown in order to crack down on hoarding and speculation. It plans to conduct a thorough investigation of the rice reserves in the Shanghai market and the names of the owners. At the same time, it will conduct rice reserve registration and report large households that manipulate, speculate, hoard, and engage in price gouging to the authorities for investigation and handling to avoid the high rice prices in the Shanghai market and affecting the livelihood of millions of citizens. A notice was issued yesterday, stating that the committee is scheduled to convene the third meeting at 3:00 PM on the 9th of this month (Tuesday). It is hoped that you will attend the meeting at that time for discussion.

Reporting to the Authorities on the Price Limit Process

The Shanghai Doumi Industry Association reported to the authorities of the two concessions and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday that on the 5th of this month, the association invited representatives from the Rice Store Association, Rice Milling Association, Rice Retail Association, Changshu Guild Hall, Nanbang Guild Hall, and the Shanghai North Rice Transportation Merchants Association to hold a joint meeting of rice industry groups to discuss the rice price issue. (Omitted from previous reports) The above is the process of this joint meeting of rice industry groups. It can be seen that there is no other reason for the change of the price limit, and the strict penalty rules are to prevent another price increase. In the end, the main purpose is still to increase the source of rice and stabilize the market price, which can be understood by your bureau (association). Therefore, a special letter is submitted for reporting, hoping to be approved for record, and expressing great gratitude.

Six Surveys of Accurate Rice Reserves

The Rice Evaluation Committee is responsible for surveying the rice reserves in each rice warehouse. The sixth survey ended yesterday. According to the announcement, the total amount of rice in the city is 567,138 bags, a decrease of 44,015 bags compared to the previous survey. However, the rice reserves of various rice stores, totaling more than 300,000 bags, are not included. The accurate figures for each rice warehouse are recorded below: Bank of China 114,315 bags, Bank of Communications 4,700 bags, China One Trust 100 bags, Jin Cheng Bank 6,730 bags, Kenye Bank 337 bags, Industrial Bank 46,552 bags, China Bank 26,550 bags, Zhejiang Industrial Bank East and West Warehouses 91,519 bags, Jiangsu Second 4,643 bags, Local Bank 11,391 bags, Donglai Bank 5,143 bags, Shanghai One Warehouse 8,072 bags, Shanghai Two Xie Chang De 2,714 bags, Zi Kang 8,225 bags, Hengfeng 803 bags, Long Mao 21,276 bags, Yuan Xing 554 bags, Yuan Xiang 808 bags, Yong Sheng 380 bags, Sheng Ji 781 bags, Tai Kang 133 bags, Da Da 3,337 bags, Zheng Feng North and South 3,602 bags, Rui Feng 3,450 bags, Da Feng Chang 769 bags, Zheng Da 4,618 bags, Da Youyu 5,892 bags, Da Dexin North 2,261 bags, Gong Ji 1,469 bags, Heng Yi Gong 40 bags, De He Xiang 1,668 bags, Xin Yu West 6,900 bags, Sheng He Long 2,726 bags, Da Dexin Middle 6,500 bags, Cheng Yi 240 bags, Xian Mao 300 bags, Heng Da 5,694 bags, Da Dexin South 4,198 bags, Ju Tai He 154 bags, Heng Xing Yi 229 bags, Jiangnan 1,303 bags, Yi Xing Feng 3,943 bags, Run Ji 1,924 bags, Jiu Da 266 bags, Wan Chang 2,050 bags, Xin Ye 1,400 bags, He Ji South 357 bags, Yu Cheng 180 bags, Heng Tai 294 bags, Qia Da 720 bags, Zhang Xie Ji 710 bags, Wan Sen Sheng 320 bags, Yu Sheng 548 bags, Wan Sheng Tai 275 bags, Yi Xin 1,541 bags, Fa Ji 538 bags, Zhou Ting Ji 152 bags, Xie Ji 50 bags, Mao Tai 26,436 bags, Xie Chang De 1,125 bags, Qing Sheng Yi 1,074 bags, Tong Shen 3,253 bags, Taikoo 941 bags, Chang Yi Heng 1,053 bags, Ding Tai De 13,389 bags, An Shen Two Warehouses 1,570 bags, An Shen Three Warehouses 6,971 bags, Xin Feng 418 bags, Hu Feng Xin Yuan 21,219 bags, Ren He 1,107 bags, Yue Lai 249 bags, Ping He 2,695 bags, Xie Da 350 bags, Da Xing 4,719 bags, Ding Yu 6,740 bags, Yuan Tong 2,637 bags, Ding Xing 5,842 bags, Ding He 21,570 bags, He Ji 11,708 bags, Huang Chang Sheng 1,022 bags, Tong Fa 90 bags, Deng Ren Tai 901 bags, Feng Sheng 778 bags, Heng Xin Shun 55 bags, Tong Sheng Heng 40 bags, Heng Xing Gong 158 bags, Wan Sheng Xing 200 bags, Wan Tai Xiang 715 bags, He Ji North 1,769 bags.

Sincerely Advising to Maintain People's Food Supply

A reporter from Xin Sheng She met with a leader of the rice industry yesterday morning. According to him, the total rice reserves in Shanghai are more than 500,000 bags. The cost of these reserves is around the price limit. If they are sold at the price limit, there will be profits. Now, hoarders are taking advantage of this lean season to manipulate rice prices in order to seek huge profits, which is hateful. In addition to reporting to the authorities for investigation and handling, it is hoped that all hoarders will consider the overall situation and share the difficulties of the times, and not engage in speculative rice business. Because rice is a daily necessity for citizens, it is different in nature from other goods.

Not Suitable for Hoarding During the Plum Rain Season

Due to the soaring rice prices, the general public in the two concessions are rushing to buy rice from rice stores. As a result, rice stores that are members of the Rice Store Association have seen a surge in transactions in recent days. Now, each rice store has advised rice buyers that Shanghai's rice reserves are still sufficient, and the source of rice will not be interrupted after dredging. Moreover, as the plum rain season is approaching, it is not suitable to buy and hoard too much rice. According to rice industry sources, the rice reserves surveyed by the Evaluation Committee refer to various warehouses and firms. As for the rice pre-purchased by citizens, it is not included.

Exert Efforts to Dredge the Source of Rice

In order to maintain the food supply for the citizens of Shanghai, various rice industry groups, in addition to cracking down on speculation, manipulation, hoarding, and price gouging, are also making every effort to dredge the source of rice. Because the rice transported from the producing areas to Shanghai will definitely not suffer losses according to the current price limit. Although the producing areas are affected by the Japanese control and the local authorities restrict leaving the border, the transport of rice to Shanghai has not been cut off. The rice blocked at the Rice Market Ferry and other places has been successively released. The goods arriving in Shanghai in recent days amount to three or four thousand bags per day, which is the same as in previous years.

### Foreign Ships Gradually Sailing on Zhejiang-Shanghai Route

Full Restoration Still Under Consideration, Current Situation Has Not Yet Eased

Regarding the Shanghai-Wenzhou and Shanghai-Dinghai routes, after being approved by the Zhejiang Eastern Military Authorities, transportation has gradually been dredged. However, due to incidents such as Japanese warships hindering or detaining ships, most foreign ships are watching and not moving forward in order to avoid accidental losses. Currently, there are only a few flights. The situation will be observed later, and if there are no other changes, the full restoration will be carried out. The reporter from Da Guang She has investigated and recorded the situation as follows:

Ende and Nanning Come to Shanghai Together

The Ende ship of the Italian Chinese Company, after sailing empty from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the 5th of this month, arrived safely at that port on the evening of the 6th. It is currently loading various passengers and goods. It was originally planned to return to Ningbo on the 7th, but due to insufficient loading of passengers and goods, it was changed to leaving Wenzhou on the evening of the 8th. If there are no other accidents or delays during the voyage, it is expected that it will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon. According to the report received by the British Taikoo Company's Nanning ship from Hong Kong to Wenzhou, it is already on its way from Wenzhou to Shanghai and will arrive in Shanghai at 4:00 PM tomorrow.

German Ships Resuming Service to Wenzhou One After Another

The Moufu ship of the German Lihuo Foreign Company was originally scheduled to resume service to Wenzhou soon. However, after the incident of the detention of the German Pingdeng ship by the Japanese warship, it was postponed again and again. In view of the fact that the British Jardine Matheson Company's Lisheng, Taikoo's Nanning, and the Italian Chinese Company's Ende have resumed service, the ship is also scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to Wenzhou this morning (9th). The German Lulin Foreign Company's Feikang and Lihuo Foreign Company's Haifu are also planning to resume service to Wenzhou tomorrow (10th). If there are no other changes, the schedule will not be changed.

Hana Ship Changed to Sailing to Dinghai Tomorrow

The Hana ship of the German Far East Company, which resumed service on the Shanghai-Dinghai line for the first time, returned to Shanghai on the 7th. The second flight was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 8th, but due to the loading and unloading time of passengers and goods, it was postponed to 4:00 PM today (9th).

### Foreigners Send Telegrams, Japanese Planes Bomb Mogan Mountain, Which is Actually a Neutral Zone, Senders Urge the Consular Corps to Maintain It

The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that the secretary of the Mogan Mountain Summer Resort Association, also known as Beckman, a member of the Southern American Methodist Church, received a brief telegram last night (7th) from Nordhute, the person in charge of the Mogan Mountain Refugee Shelter, stating that the famous summer resort 50 kilometers north of Hangzhou was bombed by Japanese planes yesterday morning. This is the first air raid on Mogan Mountain since the Chinese army withdrew from the Hangzhou area. The telegram did not specify the number of casualties or material losses. The place of origin was Xiaofeng County, near Mogan Mountain. It is believed that Nordhute ordered coolies to go from Mogan Mountain to the nearest telegram station to send the

Bombed News

It was sent out at 1:54 AM yesterday morning, with a slight delay. It was received here at 10:02 PM last night, stating, "Japanese planes bombed Mogan Mountain today, urging the consular corps to maintain the neutral zone, Nordhute." It is heard that there are many chicken farmers living in Mogan Mountain, most of whom are extremely poor. According to Beckman's estimation, when he left the area in January, there were 2,000 refugees, almost

All Women and Children

When foreigners leave the mountain, the International Relief Committee, run by Chinese, takes care of these refugees, assists in self-reliance activities, and provides free education. Nordhute was invited to stay in Mogan Mountain to take care of the refugees after Shirase of Soochow University. In his capacity as a neutral person, he is doing his best to protect the area and the refugees. Both the Chinese and Japanese armies have agreed to avoid Mogan Mountain, so the mountain is actually a neutral zone. According to Ms. Huait, who has been engaged in

Relief Work

For several months before coming to Shanghai, she stated this morning that during the war in the area, Chinese soldiers were not allowed to stay on the mountain. The Chinese army had orders that they must not approach the area unless they were oppressed by the Japanese army to the point of extreme danger. The Chinese army was able to implement this guarantee. Since Chinese soldiers could not stay in the area, the mountain was never used as a base for the Chinese guerrillas to fight. Therefore, there is no reasonable motive for the bombing yesterday morning. It is said that guerrillas would rather use

Xiaofeng and Wukang

Mountains with fewer traces of people in the area, rather than Mogan Mountain, which clearly shows its route on the tourist map. Even when the Japanese army advanced from the Taihu Lake area to the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway, the Chinese regular army did not use the mountain as a military base for the benefit of the civilians living in Mogan Mountain. Most of the foreigners on the mountain withdrew a few months before Hangzhou fell, taking public buses to Ningdu and then taking a boat to Shanghai. The withdrawal was taken care of by the Zhejiang Provincial Government and proceeded smoothly.

### Fundraising Society Organized by Fellow Provincials - Donation Situation

It is now reported that the center, in order to expand its operations, has specially invited artists to hold a broadcast fundraising campaign at the Dalaideng and other radio stations all day today (5/9). It is also reported that the board of directors, led by Zhou Bangjun, has approved renowned artists in Yue opera and comedic singing to perform voluntarily. It is expected to be a grand occasion, and enthusiastic philanthropists are encouraged to donate generously. The proceeds are certain to be considerable.

### Japanese Warships Break into Dinghai - Ningbo Bombed Four Times

Incendiary Bombs Destroy Over a Hundred Houses with No Casualties - Japanese Warships Break into Dinghai and Then Sail Away on Their Own

According to the Datong News Agency, after Ningbo was bombed by Japanese aircraft in the commercial district on the 28th of last month and on the 1st and 2nd of this month, on the morning of the 6th, Japanese aircraft again flew to Ningbo to wreak havoc. On that day, a total of seven Japanese aircraft came and dropped twenty-one bombs at both ends of the Xinjiang Bridge. The bomb landing sites included Fangjingtou, Tangxing Street, Yinhang Street (i.e., Hongxia Street), Maojia Alley, and the Taohuadu and Baisha River surfaces on the north bank.

Over a Hundred Houses Destroyed

The bombs that landed on Yinhang Street included incendiary bombs, so they immediately caught fire and burned, destroying over a hundred houses. Because the residents had automatically evacuated in advance, there were no casualties. However, after this fourth catastrophe, Ningbo's commercial heart has been severely damaged, and the bustling city is like a ruin. There are very few people during the day. However, the local administration is proceeding as usual, and the work of comforting and relieving victims is being actively carried out.

Japanese Warships Harass Dinghai

In addition to the bombing incident in Ningbo, according to the Datong News Agency's reporters, on the morning of the 6th, at 9:00 AM, a Japanese warship suddenly appeared in Dinghai and broke into Zhushanmen (i.e., the Dinghai port), anchoring directly on the Jiangtou River. Because it did not attempt to dock and land, the local authorities responded calmly. The warship sailed away on its own at 11:00 AM at noon, but the residents of the Dinghai urban area were inevitably alarmed, and many people relocated.

Factory Relocation

Since Ningbo was bombed by Japanese aircraft several times, the number of casualties was considerable, and the damage to houses was significant. According to a letter from residents in Shanghai yesterday, after the Japanese aircraft bombed Ningbo, stores immediately stopped doing business during the day. Local agencies and commercial firms that did not have storefronts had all moved out of the bustling areas. All factories had also been ordered to move to the countryside to start work. The elderly, weak, women, and children among the residents, as well as unnecessary personnel, had also been notified to evacuate separately. Therefore, the Ningbo market is less lively during the day, except at night. Foreigners residing in Ningbo had all hung flags or drawn very clear signs on their residences and properties. The authorities were actively adding various air defense facilities, but the market was as peaceful as usual, and people were still calm.

Schools Suspended

According to reports, since Ningbo was bombed by Japanese aircraft several times, all schools had decided to evacuate and suspend classes separately. Most schools had announced a temporary suspension of classes for ten days from the end of last month. After the period expired, a decision would be made based on the situation.

### Chuansha Guerrilla - Zhou Jintao Passes Away

Zhou Jintao, the commander of the 1st Battalion of Zhang Huifang's Hua Army Guerrilla Force in Chuansha County, Pudong, since leading his troops to recover the suburbs of the city last month, was ordered to be stationed at Xujialukou in the county, repeatedly threatening the Japanese and puppet troops. However, Zhou Jintao was wounded by a bullet in a fierce battle with the Japanese and puppet troops on the 16th of last month. Although the team urgently sent him to Puxi for treatment, Zhou passed away due to excessive grief and indignation. He sacrificed himself for the country, and all who heard of it mourned.

### Various Japanese Government Bonds - Plummet in Foreign Markets

4% Government Bonds Only Worth £28 - Others Only Around £40

According to the French-language "Beijing Political News," according to London news, in the past month, Japanese government bonds have continued to fall in the London market. Their prices are all below 50% of the face value. It is reported that the Japanese 4% government bonds of 1899 are now only worth £29, the 4% government bonds of 1910 are only worth £28, the 5% government bonds of 1907 are only worth £37, and the 6% government bonds of 1924 are only worth £43. Also, the 5% Tokyo municipal bonds are only worth £38.

### Chairman of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce Praises - Chinese Merchants Have Amazing Abilities - Trading in Extremely Difficult Circumstances - Anxious About Promoting International Trade

The Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce held its annual meeting yesterday. Chairman Schlusser elected new officials and read last year's report, which gave a visual description of the business last year. The following is an excerpt from Schlusser's speech,

Merchants' Difficulties Reported to the Government

Schlusser first talked about the Sino-Japanese War, saying that our residence in Hong Kong is closely related to the current Sino-Japanese War. Unfortunately, the Sino-Japanese War does not seem to be stopping. We are heartbroken that we cannot stand by and mediate. What is gratifying is that Hong Kong has done its best to help the refugees in the war zone. The main purpose of this chamber of commerce is to promote the interests of international trade and the open door policy, which we are deeply concerned about. This chamber of commerce has reported the difficulties felt by merchants to the government, but the government has many things to deal with and may not have time to take care of them for the time being. We must be patient and wait. The representatives of the British government and the British chambers of commerce in various parts of China have helped a lot in conveying the opinions of the British merchants. The Hong Kong government is also paying close attention to the Chinese people's business in difficult times. We should express our gratitude here.

Amazing Ability of Chinese Merchants

Schlusser described Hong Kong's trade last year, saying that most of Hong Kong's business last year could be described as satisfactory, but it was only temporary, because the business of the Yangtze River and North China was transferred here. In October, Guangzhou fell, and the Pearl River and the Chinese section of the Jiugang Road were closed, and business immediately declined, but the impact was not as great as we expected, because Chinese merchants have amazing abilities and can trade in extremely difficult circumstances. After the outbreak of the war, refugees gathered in Hong Kong, which increased the government's difficulties, but at the same time stimulated Hong Kong's business. Under the imperial preferential tariff system, manufacturing goods to supply the imperial market maintained a superior position last year. This proves that the plan is sufficient to promote imperial trade.

Eager to Restore Shipping on the Pearl River

Hong Kong's shipyards are also very developed. Taikoo Shipyard built four ships last year. At the beginning of this year, it also built the "Breconshire" wheel with a weight of 10,000 tons for Glendon Shipping Company. This is the largest ship ever built in Hong Kong. Its sister ship "Glenrothes" is also under construction at the yard. Huangpu Shipyard built a total of fifteen new ships last year, including the "Yongsheng" and "Taisheng" wheels of the Annam Shipping Company. Those who had been repaired in the shipyard had the intention of mailing Gan Deluozi. Although Hong Kong can trade in the current situation, it is quite restricted. We are eager to reopen the Pearl River and restore shipping.

Manufacturing Export Merchants' Interests

Schlusser then briefly described the implementation of the Imperial Air Mail Plan to Hong Kong and the government's increase in mail delivery time, and then raised the issue of the government's plan to take back the wharves in 1949, saying that the government issued a notice in October last year, saying that it did not intend to renovate the wharves and only considered expanding the port, whether it was done by the government or by merchants, or jointly by the government and merchants, but promised not to delay the time and accepted good opinions. Since then, the government has not issued any more notices, so we must wait for the government's plan to be released before we can decide again, but it is better for the government to hand it over to merchants. Schlusser then mentioned the Imperial Preferential Tariff System, saying that Hong Kong manufacturers and exporters have benefited greatly from it. The largest industries developed in Hong Kong under this tariff system are canvas, rubber shoes, etc.

### Jewish Refugees - Another 400 Arrive

Scarlet Fever Still Rampant - One Youth Has Died

Continental News reports that 440 Jewish refugees from Germany arrived in Shanghai yesterday (7th) aboard the Italian mail ship Contiroso. This brought the total number of European refugees to around 8,000. The refugees landed at the Customs Wharf at around 6:00 PM, including fifty children. There were also a small number of more unfortunate refugees.

Sick on the Ship

They were sent to the Jewish Refugee Hospital on Huasheng Road by doctors from the European Refugee Committee. Their conditions were not serious. According to the refugees, they had been imprisoned in a concentration camp in their home country, but they were afraid of Nazi retaliation, so they did not dare to describe their experiences in the country they did not want to return to. The local committee has accommodated 100 of the newly arrived refugees in the Riverside Building. Dozens more have been taken care of by relief organizations.

Sheltering in Churches on the Museum Road

A small number of refugees were welcomed by relatives who had arrived here before them and provided with temporary accommodation. According to some refugees who arrived in Shanghai, the journey from Europe was comfortable and there were very few cases of seasickness. The English-language "Greater America Evening Post" reports that a terrible case of scarlet fever has invaded the European refugee camp north of the Suzhou River. As of today (8th), a total of 110 people have been infected with the disease. Yesterday afternoon, one person died. German-Jewish doctors have received voluntary

Nursing Assistance

from among the refugees and are doing their best to contain the spread of the disease. Jordan, the director of the Public Works Bureau's health department, stated that the health department is working with doctors to treat patients in the temporary isolation hospital on Zhaofeng Road. However, the situation does not allow the health authorities of the Public Concession to fully assist these refugees, as the Public Concession is densely populated and there are not enough nurses. At the same time, health workers are currently in the refugee camp where the disease was discovered

Conducting Disinfection

and are doing their best to help doctors fight the spread of scarlet fever. Within a few days, there were 110 cases, which is alarming, but the medical community here believes that this epidemic can be dealt with satisfactorily in the short term. The person who died yesterday was a 25-year-old youth who arrived in Shanghai with his parents on April 3. He was sent to the hospital at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon and died around 5:00 PM.

### Strike at Japanese Shanghai Ferry Company - Japanese Staff Routinely Beat and Humiliate Employees - Company Forced to Sign Guarantee Conditions

The Shanghai Ferry Company, funded by the Japanese Nisshin Shipping Company, has a total of thirteen ferries, including "Donggou Maru," "Dongchang Maru," "Xidu Maru," "Qichang Maru," "Beijing Maru," "Dinghai Maru," "Weisai Maru," "Takahashi Maru," "Jiangsu Maru," "Chunjiang Maru," "Wusong Maru," "Zhejiang Maru," and "Qingning Maru."

Dingshi Shibata often used his power to beat and humiliate the Chinese employees, causing dissatisfaction. Yesterday morning, a sudden strike broke out by the entire workforce, and several demands were made, resulting in the originally scheduled 8:00 AM departure of each ferry being temporarily blocked. Passengers in the West Ferry of Pudong were also unable to cross the river. At 10:00 AM, the company expressed its willingness to compromise and first called the captains and others to start operations, while the ticket sellers and inspectors insisted that the manager must first

before they would resume work. Therefore, after the ferries resumed sailing at 10:00 AM, there were no ticket sellers, and the company dispatched more than ten internal Chinese and Japanese staff members to take their place. Due to the shortage of manpower, too many tickets were missed all day, resulting in considerable losses. It was not until 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon that the Japanese manager Shibata expressed his willingness to compromise again and

the four demands of the Chinese employees on the spot: (1) No beating of Chinese employees; (2) Crew members can take turns leaving the ship outside of working hours, and ticket sellers and inspectors can return home after completing their work; (3) The company will study ways to increase wages; (4) No dismissal of Chinese employees without cause. The strike was resolved, and the ticket sellers and inspectors who left the ship are scheduled to return to work on the ship this morning.

### Postal Workers Going to Southwest Set Date - Leaving Shanghai for Haiphong

Kaifeng Parcel Post Has Been Restored

Ten Class B postal workers from the Shanghai Postal Administration requested the bureau to allow them to leave Shanghai to serve in the Southwest postal area. After being approved by the bureau, they completed the handover at the beginning of last week. It is now learned that the ten Class B postal workers are scheduled to depart on the 10th of this month, take a ship to Haiphong, and then transfer from Haiphong to various parts of the Southwest. Also, since the bulk commodity parcel post in Kaifeng was suspended a few days ago, it has recently been restored due to the recovery of transportation in the area. The Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice saying, "From today, all parcels sent to Kaifeng or nearby areas can be accepted as usual. This is a special announcement." Also, regarding bulk parcels to Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and other provinces and cities, it was originally intended to resume acceptance on May 8 (Monday), but due to the Haiphong Post Office being unable to transfer them, a telegram was sent to temporarily suspend the resumption. As for personal and pharmaceutical parcels, they can still be delivered as usual.

### Public Works Bureau Protects - Peace Memorial Tower

A certain Western organization in this city, in order to maintain the appearance of the Peace Memorial Tower on the Bund, sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau asking it to take measures to protect the tower and, if necessary, add a fence to prevent idlers from entering. The Public Works Bureau immediately dispatched police to guard the area and ordered the Public Works Department to maintain cleanliness. As for the organization's proposal to add a fence, it was decided to postpone it because it required a sum of 1,500 yuan, which was not included in this year's budget, and the fence might detract from the appearance. If the measures currently adopted are not effective within three months, it will be reconsidered at that time.

### Fresh Pigs Transported to Shanghai Detained Again - Pork Industry Insists on Not Yielding

Pig Merchants Seriously Negotiate with Carrier Company - Cargo Volume of Foreign Vessels on the Yangtze River Plummets

The fresh pig industry, because fresh pigs have been robbed repeatedly, refused to pay the unnamed fees and did not yield to the pressure for days. Since the stalemate, pig traders, because they could not control the goods, regarded the transportation to Shanghai for sale as a dangerous journey, resulting in a shortage of fresh meat on the market and soaring prices. The meat industry has decided to refuse to sell pigs of unknown origin. The details are as follows:

Fresh Pigs Transported to Shanghai Detained Again

The pigs that arrived in Shanghai on the 7th, 517 fresh pigs transported by the Japanese ship Chiyo Maru and 472 fresh pigs transported by the Defeng Maru, were illegally detained by the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou. Pig merchants are still seriously negotiating with the carrier company. It is reported that a large number of goods from Jiafeng and Dechang in the incoming goods were also taken away. As a result, the cargo volume of foreign shipping companies on the Yangtze River plummeted. In fact, the transportation of fresh pigs cannot be carried out freely.

Refuse to Purchase Pigs of Unknown Origin

It is reported that someone was selling slaughtered white pork of unknown origin in the Xiaocai Market on Beijing Road the day before yesterday, and was scolded by passers-by as shameless. Also, Xie, the owner of Rongji Meat Shop, was persuaded by enthusiastic members for buying goods of unknown origin, which led to a conflict and the white meat was thrown on the ground. When the store owner reported the arrest to the scene, the storm was avoided. As for other meat industries, they have firmly refused fresh meat of unknown origin, and slaughterhouses have also stopped slaughtering these pigs.

### Public Relief Pawnshop - Actively Planning

Methods of Implementation Being Drafted

Pawnshops are financial assistance institutions for the common people. The pawnshop industry in our country has always been subject to the traditional profit-making policy, which has led to the suspicion of exploitation and is criticized by society. Since the environment of Shanghai has changed and refugees have gathered, all sectors are trying to provide relief, and the industry has taken the opportunity to rise. High-interest pawnshops have increased endlessly. Previously, Mr. Ji Mingzhai and others suggested to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association and requested the Ministry of Finance to set up a fair and relief-oriented public relief pawnshop. It is now learned that Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi has expressed his appreciation for this suggestion and has issued an instruction No. Yuqian Zi 2206, which roughly stated, "In addition to ordering pawnshops across the country to reduce interest rates and extend periods, and ordering the Farmers Bank to provide low-interest loans, as for the establishment of a public relief pawnshop in Shanghai, since the applicant has written to the Relief Association for handling, it will still be handled by the association." Now, Mr. Ji and others, according to the approval order, have written to the Relief Association to expedite the handling, and will discuss in detail with Mr. Hu Shouqi, a fundraising member of the association, to plan everything. It is reported that Mr. Hu believes that this measure will not only relieve the current economic situation of the common people, but also benefit the national economy, people's livelihood, social security, and peace. He is willing to be responsible for actively promoting it in order to achieve it as soon as possible.

### French Cruiser - Leaves Shanghai and Sails Elsewhere

The English-language "Greater America Evening Post" reports that the French colonial cruiser "Bayard" set sail from Shanghai at 8:00 AM this morning (8th).

### The Visit of Lin Kanghou (2)

— Zhou

He said that the market situation in Shanghai suffered a temporary slump in financial situation at the end of the year before last. However, thanks to the efforts of all parties, by the end of last year, in addition to new accounts without arrears, about 70% of old accounts had been repaid. The general business situation has greatly improved. As for the remittance system, it is indeed beneficial to finance. Then, he talked about the efficiency of China's currency system promotion. He said that Chinese society was originally a semi-cash system. Since the government implemented the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan, it can be said that it was preparing to implement the legal currency policy. However, the necessary path was to abolish taels and adopt yuan, and then to abolish yuan and adopt legal currency. Now that the legal currency policy has been successful, it can adjust everything in this extraordinary period. The smooth circulation is indeed the most important page in the history of Chinese finance. He contributed to the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan and the implementation of legal currency at that time, and tried his best to promote it. He was modest and said that he was only doing his duty. He was very concerned about this newspaper. He said that the spirit of hard work of the "Shen Bao" now is admirable. Those who can work hard will surely be able to revive.

The reporter then asked Mr. Lin about the way to establish oneself and live in the world. He said that his usual creed of self-discipline is: first, be careful in speaking and eating; second, be happy even in suffering; third, eat breakfast early, eat lunch full, and eat dinner less; fourth, do not make people afraid, but should make people love; fifth, having money but not using it is like managing accounts for others; wasting money is like having no money at all. It can be said that he goes everywhere for entertainment, but he does not go to things that are not beneficial to society. He believes that entertainment is a necessary adjustment to relax the body and mind, but he does not linger. He often recites Mencius's "Those who are capable will also do so," "Those who wait for King Wen to rise are ordinary people," "As for heroes, they will rise even without King Wen," "When heaven is about to entrust a great task to someone, it must first afflict his mind, exhaust his muscles and bones, starve his body, and empty his body" to encourage himself. When the reporter was talking to him, Mr. Lin recited it repeatedly, which also shows his firm belief in ancient precepts.

In addition to what the reporter knew, Mr. Lin also talked about his academic and service experience. Now, a summary is given below to show Mr. Lin's spirit of service:

He first studied with his father. The school was in the countryside, so his habits are simple. This comes from his understanding of the difficulty of farming. Then, he studied with his maternal uncle, Mr. Shen Xinqing. In his early years, he was a supplementary doctor's disciple. He studied in a certain surname's residence, earning 20 gold coins per section, a total of 60 gold coins per year, supplemented by the academy's scholarships (i.e., what is now called scholarships). Because the social economy was balanced in those days, and because of his thrift, his life was very affluent.

Before the Reform Movement of 1898, he already felt that China would not prosper unless it changed its laws. However, his views were different from those of the contemporary figures. At that time, the general advocates of reform believed that abolishing the imperial examination and establishing schools could immediately enrich the country and strengthen the army. However, his opinion was not to oppose abolishing the imperial examination and not establishing schools. He believed that abolishing the imperial examination was one thing, and establishing schools was another. The imperial examination itself was not for cultivation, but a tool for selecting talents. Schools are the institutions for cultivating talents. He believed that the reformers at that time used the abolition of the imperial examination to run schools as a tool for exercising political power. In fact, the people had no political training and did not understand the content of the reform, let alone the power to supervise and cooperate. The result was just scratching the surface.

### Women's Circles - Celebrated Mother's Day Yesterday

Held Commemorative Meetings and Dinners Separately - And Visited Distressed Mothers in Shelters

Yesterday was International Mother's Day. The women's circles in this city celebrated enthusiastically. Women's groups held commemorative meetings and dinners separately and visited distressed mothers in shelters. All sectors expressed their unlimited respect for the lofty maternal love.

Celebration Meeting at International Shelter

Yesterday was the anniversary of Mother's Day. The First Shelter of the International Relief Committee on Masnan Road held a special entertainment celebration meeting. More than 300 mothers and their children participated in the grand event. Mrs. Yudan, Honorary President of the Commemorative Meeting, representatives of the Women's Relief Association and the female students of Daxia University, the director of the shelter, Pan Da, and all the Chinese and Western staff attended. Mr. Wang Wulin of Yumin Egg Factory donated one duck egg to each mother to show respect. The commemorative meeting distributed sweets. The Nursery for Laboring Refugees Participating in Production at the shelter also opened on the same day, and Mrs. Yudan cut the ribbon. There were many entertainment programs, including dramas and songs and dances. Mrs. Yu also gave a speech, which roughly stated, "China is now growing on the road to new life, so the task of mothers in the new China is even more important. The selfish psychology of raising children to wait for old age and storing grain to prevent famine in the past is gone. You are now offering your children to the country and the nation. Dear mothers of the new China, I would like to take this great anniversary to congratulate you on completing the great task of mothers in the new China, so that the new China will be realized sooner!" The entire audience was very moved and thanked her for her sincere sympathy for China and Chinese mothers. The event ended happily until after 5:00 PM.

The monthly fee is ten yuan, payable three months in advance, and no assessment is required.

### Guerilla Commander Yang Xingfang's Alleged Acceptance of a Puppet Position is Unconfirmed

According to a visitor from Changyinsha, Yang Xingfang, the former guerilla commander of Chang County, has remained uninvolved in all external activities since a conflict with a certain guerilla unit last year. A recent report stated that a certain party appointed Yang as the "Pacification Commander" of the county. According to those close to Yang, this is purely speculation and not factual. It is rumored that a certain party has repeatedly sent people to persuade him, but Yang has refused each time. He has been living in seclusion, adopting a very passive attitude.

She has recently sought refuge in Shanghai, residing at No. 8, Lane 108, Huanlong Road in the French Concession. Members of the Women's Calligraphy and Painting Association have encouraged her to showcase her work to the public. Her uncle, Mr. Pingzhai, has already set the price list on her behalf.

### Forged Yi Bao Envelopes Sent Out "Giving An Example" Shows that Wang Jingwei's Examples are Fabricated

A few readers of the Yi Bao newspaper yesterday each sent a forged envelope of the newspaper to the newspaper. Each envelope contained a printed piece titled "Giving An Example", which was written by Wang Jingwei and was previously denounced by Wu Zhihui. These forged envelopes, whether in terms of paper color, ink color, handwriting, or size, are completely different from the Yi Bao newspaper envelopes. The Yi Bao's real envelopes are pure white paper, while the forged envelopes are light pink. The Yi Bao's real envelopes are printed in vermilion red, while the forged envelopes are in magenta. Furthermore, the Yi Bao's real envelopes are wider than the forged ones, and the handwriting and arrangement of the words are also different. This kind of forgery is clearly intended to slander the Yi Bao and deceive its readers. In fact, the Yi Bao's position has long been known to the public, and no one will believe in such a thing. Instead, it exposes Wang Jingwei and his followers' habit of fabrication, making people suspect that the so-called examples in "Giving An Example" are all rumors and slander.

### The Cao Jiazhen Kidnapping Case: Bizarre Appeal Testimony

Claiming Collusion with Cao to Swindle Money from His Mother. Cao Denies it Completely. The Trial is Concluded and Awaiting Judgment.

Cao Jiazhen, a 27-year-old from Ningbo Cixi, residing at No. 488, Jianye Lane, Fuli Road, French Concession, and working at the Datong Shipping Company at No. 207, Second Floor, Guangdong Bank on Jiangxi Road, was kidnapped at 6:00 PM on March 2nd of this year while returning home from work. Lin Xucen (29 years old, a former cosmetics dealer who lost his job after the war), a fellow townsman and classmate, colluded with his father, Lin Jinyou (67 years old), to

Design and Execute the Kidnapping

They hid Cao in the attic of Yangjian Elementary School at No. 9, Lane 1216, the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Massenet. They then falsely used the name of He Hongda, the head of the Labor Iron Blood Corps, to send a letter to Cao's mother, Cao Qiu Shi, demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan. Subsequently, after negotiating the ransom price over the phone, they agreed on 1,000 yuan. Later, Cao's maternal uncle, Qiu Youxin, reported to the French Police, who sent detectives to arrest Lin Xucen at the Danghu Inn in Huajin Lane, Shanxi Road, on the 5th of the same month, rescuing the hostage. They also

Arrested the Guarding Lin Father, Lin Jinyou, and Lin Sister, Lin Maoren, et al.

They were transferred to the Special Second Court, and the French Concession authorities filed a public lawsuit according to law. After the first trial, Lin Xucen was sentenced to ten years in prison, Lin Jinyou to seven years in prison, and both were deprived of their civil rights for the duration of their sentences. Lin Maoren was sentenced to three years and six months in prison and deprived of her civil rights for three years. Because the Lins did not accept the verdict, they appealed to the High Third Branch Court. During the appeal period, Lin Jinyou died in the detention center due to old age and illness.

Died of Illness

The details of each situation have been recorded in this newspaper. The High Third Branch Court held a trial yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in the Third Criminal Court, presided over by Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi, along with Judges Gu Hongbiao and He Jingcen, and Prosecutor Zhao Changmin. Appellant Lin Jinyou had passed away, and Lin Maoren was in custody and severely ill, unable to present her case. Only Lin Xucen was brought to trial. According to Lin's statement of the grounds for appeal, he stated that because he lost his job after the war, he had repeatedly asked Cao Jiazhen for loans last year.

In Order to Do Business

Cao agreed, but he had no money on hand. On March 2nd, I opened a room at the Asia Hotel and wrote a note with a fake name of "Chen" to have my father invite Cao to come and discuss the loan again. Cao arrived at the Asia Hotel after 6:00 PM, and my father accompanied him to my house. Cao said that he could not borrow money at the moment and asked me to write a threatening letter to his mother, pretending that Jiazhen had been kidnapped, but in reality, he was temporarily staying at my house, waiting for his mother to pay the ransom. Cao also asked me to make a phone call to his relatives and contact his mother.

On the Phone

We agreed on 1,000 yuan. Cao also stipulated that he would lend me the entire purchase money of 1,000 yuan or less, and I would return 100 yuan per month. If it was more than 1,000 yuan, Cao would take the excess. He also told me not to leak it to the outside world to avoid being reprimanded by his mother. Therefore, I followed his plan. The incident was discussed jointly with Cao Jiazhen, requesting a reduced sentence, etc. Cao Jiazhen was summoned to the court for questioning and flatly denied that he had discussed writing the letter with Lin. He said that Lin had lured him to his home and illegally detained him, and he did not know how they acted.

I Don't Know Anything

The witnesses, Zhang Pangen, the tea boy of the Asia Hotel, as well as Qiu Yue'e, Cao Saizhen, Cao Qiu Shi, and the investigating detective Zhong Benchang, were also summoned for questioning. At this point, the court ordered a debate on Lin Xucen's part first. After the prosecutor presented his opinion, Lin's defense lawyer and Yao Zhao Di, the lawyer of the French Concession authorities, debated each other. The court announced the conclusion and scheduled a sentence to be announced. The appellant was still remanded in custody.

### The Assassination of Zhao Yongtao, Head of the Fake Armed Police

Shot Five Times and Died on the Spot. Cang Daming was Injured by a Stray Bullet.

At approximately 9:45 AM yesterday morning, at the Daxi Tea House at No. 47, opposite the White Palace Funeral Home on Daxi Road, a man with glasses and a slightly pockmarked face entered and ordered tea. Not long after, three men followed him. One stood guard outside, and two went to the man's presence. One of them drew a box-type pistol and fired seven or eight shots in succession. The man was shot five times and died on the spot. The shooters, seeing that their purpose had been achieved, calmly dispersed. At that time, Cang Daming, who lived in a shed on Dunxin Road, was injured in the hand by a stray bullet and was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the Jing'an Temple Road Police found several business cards near the deceased, with the words "Zhao Yongtao, Supervisor of the Qinfeng Refugee Cloth Factory in Fa Hua Town," as well as a badge. According to an investigation by a reporter from the Social News Agency, the deceased was indeed Zhao Yongtao, a native of Liuhe, Anhui, 37 years old this year. Before August 13th, he served as a platoon leader in the city's security team. After the National Army withdrew westward, he drifted to Shanghai and became a gangster. He had considerable influence in the Fahua Township area. Recently, Zhao suddenly assumed the position of captain of the armed police force of the puppet regime, setting up a team headquarters in the new house next to the Deji Clubhouse in the town. A month ago, one of his subordinate puppet police officers was also shot and killed, as reported in various newspapers. Unexpectedly, less than two weeks after the incident, Zhao himself was assassinated and killed. Therefore, after receiving the news yesterday, the Japanese military police stationed there conducted a house-to-house search in the nearby area in the afternoon, and it was reported that several innocent residents were arrested on the spot.

After taking it, he went directly to the home of his cousin Zhao at No. 9, Wei Hou Lane.

After the doctor's emergency treatment, his life was not in danger. As for the reason for Shi's suicide, it was because Shi's relative, Zhao, from Dinghai, Zhejiang, had a daughter named Ai Bao, 18 years old and quite beautiful. Shi intended to marry her, but was opposed by the girl's parents. Because of this, Shi was disappointed and suddenly had the idea of committing suicide.

After Pan found out, he accompanied a certain foreigner with a pair of handcuffs and hired a car between the 22nd of last month and went to the Russian brothel on Bazizi Road and accused Xu A'bao of being abducted into the brothel by Weng (Weng is the chief steward at the Russian woman Ramanini's house). Without asking the circumstances, he handcuffed her and dragged her and Xu A'bao into the car, drove to the puppet bureau to detain her, and went to Weng Jihai's house and extorted 200 yuan from his wife, Chen. The case was exposed, and the Hongkou Police arrested and escorted him to the Special First Court. After the interrogation was completed, Judge Huang presided over the court yesterday and sentenced him to six months in prison as a warning.

Mr. Cao joined the police station on October 21, 1927, and was promoted to the position of Inspector General on January 1, 1938, due to his accumulated merits. He was awarded the French Public Works Bureau Medal on March 2, 1938. Mr. Cao's successive promotions were entirely due to his outstanding talents. His handling of affairs was decisive, loyal, and courageous, and no one can match him. Therefore, all those who worked with Mr. Cao were shocked and mourned his tragic death," etc.

Two Suspects

Wang Tingsheng, a Tianjin native who was suspected to be the most serious at the time of Cao's death, is currently undergoing treatment in the hospital due to injuries. It is rumored that Wang Shaokun was also captured in addition to Wang Tingsheng, which is a misunderstanding. The two Wangs are probably the same person. This Wang Tingsheng was captured because he hit the electric pole on the side of the road while trying to escape and fell to the ground, where he was shot. His injuries have not yet healed, so he has not been formally interrogated. As for the issue of Cao's compensation, the French authorities are now weighing the situation, and the police department is also selecting personnel for the successor.

### Letter

To the editor: I saw a news item on page 10 of the third edition of your newspaper yesterday entitled "The Iron Industry Public Association Donates Achievements," which stated that "steel bars and scrap iron totaled more than 800 yuan in March and April," which is slightly inconsistent with the facts. According to the investigation, the association's total for March was 774 yuan and 8 jiao and 9 fen, which has been submitted to the Relief Association. The income for April has just been collected, totaling 1,885 yuan, 7 jiao, and 2 fen, which is still in the accounting period and has not yet been submitted to the Relief Association. It will be sent tomorrow. Therefore, I would like to request a correction to be used as a basis for the WeChat account.

### The Husband and His Sister-in-Law Live Together, Claiming to Have the Wife's Consent, Hoping to Curb Her Prodigal Behavior. The Accused Was Released on Bail After an Appeal and Interrogation.

Xia Changyu, a native of Wuxi, 30 years old this year, was in the money shop business in Suzhou. He decided to bring his wife, Xia Xuehuai Shan (31 years old), to Shanghai to avoid the disaster and lived at No. 25, Qingshun Lane, Beijing Road. Because Xia had been in love with his wife's younger sister, Xue Qi (24 years old), for a long time, he rented a house with her at No. 12, Gujia Lane, Hualong Road in the French Concession. On the morning of the 5th of last month, Xia's wife suddenly reported to the French Police, who sent detectives to

Live Together and Commit Adultery

Xia and Xue Qi were arrested and escorted to the Special Second Court. The French Concession authorities filed a lawsuit according to law. After the trial, each was sentenced to four months in prison. During the appeal period, they were detained in the detention center awaiting review. Xia and others did not accept the verdict and hired lawyer Wang Shizong to appeal to the High Third Branch Court. On the one hand, because he was ill in custody, he requested bail from the original court, and the ruling was

Rejection of Application

The case was also appealed to the High Third Branch Court. The hearing was held yesterday morning by Wu Tingqi, the presiding judge of the High Third Branch Court, along with Judges Gu and He. Xia Changyu stated the grounds for his appeal, saying that because his wife was dissolute outside, she used her sister to have a relationship with me in the 25th year to curb my dissoluteness outside, which had long been

Approved by His Wife

I live with her sister, and my parents-in-law were alive at that time, and they all knew about it. This sudden accusation has another purpose. Xue Qi said, I have a relationship and live with my brother-in-law, which was allowed by my sister and parents, and I often go back and forth with my sister, and it has been a long time, and so on. After the plaintiff, Xia Xuehuai Shan, was summoned to the court, he was informed that the conclusion would be announced and the sentence would be pronounced in ten days. The two defendants were each released on bail with a security deposit of 100 yuan, subject to the responsibility of the defense lawyer.

### Preliminary Study of the Brain and Electricity

— Qu Shaoheng

Chairman Chiang's instructions can be heard clearly by the people on the isolated island even when he is tens of thousands of miles away. Airplanes can be tracked hundreds of miles away. Is this not the power of electrical science? Therefore, it is said that the 20th century is the electrical world. I have long aspired to explore the ultimate truth of the relationship between the brain and electricity. I once said to people that the human body has electricity, which can be proven by the hair and skin. Everyone with a little scientific knowledge knows this. In the human brain, regardless of intelligence or stupidity, virtue or vice, there are electrical receiving and transmitting mechanisms. For example, if A thinks of B and goes to visit him, the electrical waves emitted from A's brain gradually reach the electrical receiving center in B's brain, causing a response. Then B's idea of A suddenly arises at the same time. This kind of thought is not contrary to the principles of electricity. It is a pity that I have not been able to conduct further research. Recently, I read Bergier's theory, which can be used to verify my ideals. He said that the human brain has electricity. It can be proved by using hair as a conductor to conduct experiments. There are two kinds of current with different wavelengths of vibration. One is a regular and never-changing current. The vibration number of this current is 8 to 12 times per second. The other is an irregular current with very drastic changes. Its vibration number actually exceeds the former's by a hundred times. It vibrates over a thousand times per second. Bergier called the former "alpha" (α) wave and the latter "beta" (β) wave. "The α wave is the same for everyone, regardless of intelligence or weakness, just like the human body temperature, which is 37 degrees regardless of gender or age. "The β wave is not like this at all. It is usually not seen flowing in the human brain. When the person's mental or emotional activity is tense, the "β current begins to circulate in the brain and covers the standby α wave. This is like when a high fever rises, the normal temperature is covered by the high fever. Moreover, the time for the "β" wave to circulate in the brain cannot last long. After a long time, people will not be able to support it. This is like the human body cannot withstand high fever for a long time. Therefore, the action of the "β wave is really or rise or fall, and there is no fixed rule. Bergier's theory is like this, which coincides with my so-called electrical induction of the human brain. Moreover, it is consistent with Bergier's idea of the alpha wave. I would like to discuss it with those who are interested in electrical science.

Popular Medical Talks

### On Dantian Breathing and Health

— Wang Yugang

According to the position of the Dantian as usually referred to, it is in the lower abdomen. This kind of breathing style, in the Taoist and martial arts practitioners' internal cultivation, is said to be very important, but I who do not know the methods and martial arts, it is difficult to glimpse the reasons why they attach importance to it, but from the physiological effects of our medical aspects to explore, we can say something about the relationship between Dantian breathing and human health.

Physiologically speaking, the types of human breathing movements can be divided into two types: one is called thoracic breathing, which relies on the expansion and contraction of the rib muscles to expand and contract the chest cavity, and the other is called abdominal breathing, which relies on the expansion and contraction of the abdominal muscles to expand and contract the abdominal wall. Generally, men use abdominal breathing more, and women use thoracic breathing more, and in the supine position, both men and women become thoracoabdominal. According to the Dantian position in the lower abdomen, the Dantian breathing belongs to abdominal breathing undoubtedly, but its meaning is to make the abdominal breathing movement fully developed to the lower abdomen, so that its function is fully exerted to the entire abdominal cavity.

In recent years, many people have noticed deep breathing exercises. Deep breathing exercises are generally considered to refer specifically to strenuous thoracic breathing, and do not contain the meaning of strenuous abdominal breathing. This is the negligence and vulgarity of people in physiology and hygiene. We should try our best to correct and promote it. Why? Because strenuous thoracic breathing can make the blood circulation in the lungs and heart in the chest cavity smooth, the metabolism is prosperous, so the lungs are healthy, the resistance is strong, and it is not easy to get sick. This is indeed a correct principle. But there are many organs in the abdominal cavity? Is it not necessary for the blood flow to be smooth, and the metabolism to be prosperous, so the matter of strenuous abdominal breathing of the same deep breathing exercise is completely ignored. Otherwise, we should advocate Dantian breathing, which should be as important as strenuous thoracic breathing, and perhaps even more meaningful. This is not an overstatement, scaring the sky, wanting to gain unexpected effects, the fact is so, the physiological function of the respiratory organs is simple, only serving the function of absorbing oxygen and exhaling carbon, while the physiological functions of the organs in the abdominal cavity are complex, more than the lungs are doubled, so it is necessary to strengthen, among which the most effective is the digestive system. To give an example, I usually say to patients with habitual constipation that laxatives should not be taken regularly. If you want to correct this disease, there is a simple method. After going to bed every night, take a steady supine position, perform strenuous abdominal breathing forty or fifty times, which can reach the Dantian is better. Do it once in the same way before getting up in the morning the next day. As a result, habitual constipation can be eliminated, daily bowel movements are smooth, and at the same time appetite is increased, and digestion is good. This is an experienced fact. Patients may wish to try it. But people with stomach ulcers or appendicitis, or nephritis should not try it, otherwise there is a danger of inducing the disease. According to this fact, the beneficial effect of abdominal breathing on the abdominal organs is very significant.

German Kiehl-Neinel placed a suction cup Saugglocke on the abdominal wall to perform suction and extrusion movements to change the activity of intra-abdominal pressure, which is nothing more than this meaning. As a result, in addition to the digestive organs being well affected, for patients with circulatory disorders, it can lower blood pressure and slow down the pulse, but I think using a suction cup to change the abdominal pressure is too clumsy, and it is much more natural and simple to use strenuous abdominal breathing.

Common Sense of Food Cultivation

### Scientific Research on Food Cultivation (Continued from Issue 15)

— Zhou Zhenyu

CO2+H2O+Sunlight+Chlorophyll→H2CO3

Carbon Oxygen Two Water Carbonic Acid

H2CO3+Sunlight+Chlorophyll→H.CHO.O2

Carbonic Acid Middle Oxygen (Freely Separated)

6(H.CHO)+Sunlight+Chlorophyll→C6H12O6

Six Methyl Thio Glucose (Carbohydrate)

After research by many people, it is known that it is the effect of ultraviolet light. Now it can be imitated with artificial sunlight, so it has been proven undoubtedly. In plants, this photochemical effect is called Photosynthesis.

Plants take shape by means of photochemical construction, so that our food is cultivated. Therefore, the heat of sunlight is indirectly transmitted to the human body, and this is method one. The life of livestock also depends on plants, because what animals need is also what humans need. However, humans are the spirits of all things, so they have special abilities to use them as food to supplement the needs of the body. Therefore, the heat of sunlight is transmitted to humans, and this is method two. Therefore, the greatness of the benefits of sunlight to mankind is indeed something that we have not been able to anticipate.

People in the world have their own innate responsibilities. Due to the different responsibilities, the lightness and heaviness of the operations are different, and therefore the food cultivation is also different. Now that we know the source of heat and the method of measuring it, we dare to discuss it separately according to the amount of heat.

For men of medium height from youth to middle age, if there is no labor, the food cultivation is enough to meet the needs of the body, and the daily requirement is 2,000 calories. If it is a slight operation, such as walking, etc., then you need to add one or two thousand more. A man of medium height refers to a body weight of seventy kilograms, which is equivalent to one hundred and fifty-four pounds. People with heavier or lighter body weight can increase or decrease their food cultivation if their operations do not change much, or calculate it proportionally according to their body weight (details separately).

The weight of ordinary women accounts for four-fifths of that of men, which is equivalent to 80% of the calculation. Although the operations of men and women are the same, the amount of heat used only accounts for four-fifths of that of men. This is because the basic metabolic rate of women is 5% lower than that of men. This difference may be due to the percentage of fat contained in the body. For example, a tall and thin man has the same weight as a short and strong man, but their basic metabolic rates are not equal, so the thin man eats more, and his thinness remains the same, while the short and strong man becomes fatter. The basic metabolic rate will be detailed separately, and will not be repeated here. (To be continued)

### Medical Gleanings

Argyria

Silver preparations are slowly absorbed from the digestive tract, so silver is deposited in the skin and body tissues, causing grayish-white to dark gray pigmentation that does not fade for life.

Feces and Breath After Using Bismuth Preparations

After using bismuth preparations, the feces become black because bismuth is vulcanized. Also, bismuth preparations often contain impurities. After internal use, the breath sometimes has a garlic odor because it is mixed with a small amount of tellurium Te(OH3)2.

Musk

Musk and the secretions of the musk sac are very different. In addition to containing fatty acids, cholic acids, etc., they also contain a certain aromatic substance that is unknown. In the past, it was used as a cardiotonic and stimulant, but there is no definitive proof from animal experiments.

Limits of Obesity

If a man of medium height weighs more than 85 kilograms, and a woman weighs more than 75 kilograms, and there is no edema, there is a suspicion of pathological obesity.

Two Stages of Obesity

Obesity initially makes people envy its strength, which is called the envy stage. When the disease progresses to a comical appearance such as a sagging belly and a double chin, it is called the comical stage. Further progress causes regret and sympathy, which is called the sympathy stage. The above is what Edstein said.

### Finance: Cash Rush Expands Due to Absorption from It

Yesterday, the black market situation was bleak. Under the cover of buying interest, the rising wind suddenly expanded, and the market situation became chaotic again. It even broke through the two levels of 2,120 yuan and 30 yuan in succession. It once reached a peak of 2,134 yuan. It was actually because of rumors in the market that "Huaxing Bank" was about to open, and there were rumors that it was secretly buying gold. Therefore, the hearts of all parties were suddenly agitated. A certain gold shop continued to vigorously advance for the South China Gang without slackening, and the securities gang also bought more and sold less. Moreover, a certain money exchange industry bought a large amount for customers, so although the silver shop gang and the gold shop sold, the supply and demand quantity was still very different, which led to the price rising to the peak. However, before the evening closing, many long positions took advantage of the high price to close out profits, so there was a slight reversal. In the end, it rose sharply by 18 yuan, and the transaction was very prosperous, reaching 1,570 taels for the whole day. Silver jewelry also rose by 2 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stagnant.

Raw Gold Jumps 18 Yuan

Starting in the morning, each bar of fifty taels, the initial opening was quite flat. First, the silver shop gang mutually traded fifty taels, with 2,120 yuan as the opening price, which was 7 yuan higher than the noon transaction price on the previous weekend. After opening, the silver shop gang forked into the money exchange industry for fifty taels, the price was the same as the morning opening. Then the cash shop mutually traded fifty taels, the price was 19 yuan. Later, the securities gang also stuffed the money exchange industry and the gold shop with fifty taels each, the price was 18 yuan each. After this, although a certain gold shop bought a large amount for customers, the silver shop gang and the gold shop frequently stuffed it vigorously, resulting in a stable situation. A certain gold shop entered the silver shop gang for a total of 200 taels, and the price was the same. Then they entered the same industry for 200 taels, and the price was also 18 yuan. Later, the money exchange industry mutually traded 70 taels, and the price was still 18 yuan. At that time, it was heard that foreign exchange futures were soft, and someone secretly moved, and the hearts of the people were suddenly agitated. A certain money exchange industry's absorption turned stronger, and the securities gang also came to vigorously advance, and the market situation suddenly became prosperous, rushing out of the 20 yuan level. A certain money exchange industry entered the same industry for 50 taels, and the price was 19 yuan. They also entered the silver shop gang for 50 taels, and the price was 20 yuan. A certain silver shop also absorbed 50 taels of the same industry for customers, and the price jumped by 5 yuan to 25 yuan. A certain money exchange industry re-entered the silver shop gang for 50 taels, and the price was 27 yuan. Later, the securities gang entered a certain gold shop for 100 taels, and the price was 28 yuan. At the same price, they entered the silver shop gang for 50 taels, and then entered a certain money exchange industry for 50 taels, and the price was 27 yuan. Before long, the money exchange industry transferred and re-entered the same industry for 50 taels, and the price was 26 yuan. After this, the buying wind gradually weakened, and retail investors took advantage of the high price to sell, so they moved downwards. The money exchange industry sold 50 taels to the gold shop, and the counterfeit noon closing price was 22 yuan. In the afternoon, because a certain gold shop and a certain money exchange industry continued to vigorously advance, the rising wind re-ignited. The initial opening was raised by 6 yuan, and then a certain money exchange industry entered the same industry for 50 taels, the price was 28 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop entered the money exchange industry for 50 taels, and the price was 29 yuan. Soon after, they entered the money exchange industry for 50 taels again, and the price was 32 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange industry and the securities gang successively vigorously entered more than 100 taels, and the price rose to 34 yuan, all supplied by the money exchange industry and the gold shop. At that time, many floating households took advantage of the high price to sell out profits, so they returned slightly. The money exchange industry sold 50 taels to the silver shop gang, and the price was 31 yuan. After this, although the sellers reduced to 28 or 9 yuan, it was difficult to open because the entrants were waiting and watching. Therefore, the evening closing was still 2,131 yuan. As a result, it rose by 18 yuan compared with the noon closing on the previous Saturday, with a difference of 16 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was 2,135 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,120 yuan. The current marked gold was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. Both were not opened.

Jewelry Listed Up 2 Yuan

The initial selling price of silver jewelry per tael in the silver shop was not changed. At 9:45, Datonghang listed 1 yuan higher because the price of raw gold had risen to the 2,120 yuan level. Later, at 10:20, Datonghang listed 1 yuan higher again because the market situation of raw gold was even stronger. At the same time, Xintonghang also listed 1 yuan higher. After this, there were no changes. Datonghang changed to suspend 216 yuan, Xintonghang was 214 yuan, and the purchase price was 208 yuan.

Sino-British Pure Gold Unmoved

The Central Bank's purchase price of Chinese cash remained stagnant at 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed Customs gold remained flat, calculated at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 li, and 6 hao. The Shanghai standard marked gold price also did not change, calculated at 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao. This was due to the London telegram on the 6th that British pure gold was still stable at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence per ounce.

### Foreign Exchange: Oil and Cotton Settle Accounts

Futures Slightly Tightened

The foreign exchange market yesterday was turbulent because oil companies, Asiatica, and cotton merchants settled their accounts, and Chinese speculators also followed suit. Moreover, the Bank of England was profitable (on behalf of the Tianjin gang), and Japanese banks also competed to vigorously buy U.S. dollar futures. However, foreign banks such as British and American banks were willing to supply cash at the maintained price, but they were less willing to supply futures. As a result, the situation showed a flat cash and soft futures. In the middle, foreign firms bought U.S. dollars for cash and hedged July futures, with a premium of 2 and a half jiao per U.S. dollar, calculated as a monthly interest rate of 5 li excluding commissions. However, it was still difficult to arouse the interest of wealthy arbitrageurs. The day's trading was quite strong. Initially, the Hong Kong dollar was hard because the money exchange industry had a strong desire to sell, but it returned to flat after foreign firms frequently absorbed it. In the end, there was still no honor or disgrace.

In the early morning, London's large bars were long or short by 125, and New York's silver price was stagnant as before. London's raw gold was also flat. The exchange rates of British dollar against U.S. dollar, against Shanghai dollar, and against French franc were all flat. The U.S. dollar against British dollar, against Shanghai dollar, and against French franc also remained unchanged. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same as before. The bank's morning opening selling prices for cash were 8 pence 25 for the British dollar and 16 yuan 0625 for the U.S. dollar, which were the same as the previous weekend's noon closing. After opening, although the settlement of accounts for cotton was quite frequent, and Chinese speculators also followed suit, there was no change because various foreign banks such as British and American banks also had a strong desire to supply. Foreign firms settled HSBC and McCallum cash British dollars at 8 pence 25. Then they and Chinese speculators successively settled accounts. A certain bank's U.S. dollar cash was 16 yuan 0625. When HSBC's listing was announced, it did not move, and the white silver balance tax was announced to be 7 and a half li, calculated as 7.00%. After this, the oil company Asiatica also purchased and settled HSBC's July British dollars at 8 pence 125. Later, the Bank of England (on behalf of the Tianjin gang) also absorbed the Dutch bank's July U.S. dollars at 15 yuan 8125. At that time, Japanese banks also purchased and settled the foreign firm's July U.S. dollars at 15 yuan 8125. Therefore, the futures situation was slightly soft. Near noon, foreign bank Ander Holland absorbed the money exchange industry's Hong Kong dollar cash at 55 yuan 875. The situation was still flat at that time. Soon after, foreign bank Naville turned weak and was willing to supply the above absorption price, so the potential was slightly hard. At the noon closing, the bank's cash selling prices for both British and U.S. dollars were no different from the morning opening. The Hong Kong dollar was 55 yuan 875.

In the afternoon, the Bank of England continued to settle HSBC British dollars for cash at 8 pence 25 on behalf of the Tianjin gang. It then settled a certain bank's U.S. dollars at 16 yuan 0625 with HuaBee. The process remained unchanged. After entering, foreign firms purchased and settled Dutch and Ander cash Hong Kong dollars at 55 yuan 75. The situation returned to flat. At the evening closing, the bank's cash selling prices were 8 pence 25 for the British dollar, 16 yuan 0625 for the U.S. dollar, and 55 yuan 75 for the Hong Kong dollar. As a result, there was no honor or disgrace for the British, U.S., and Hong Kong dollars compared with the previous weekend's noon closing.

### British and American Gold Pounds Rise Again

Yesterday, foreign exchange in this port was settled very heavily by foreign firms, such as yarn and flower gangs, Japanese banks, Asiatica, etc., which absorbed quite strongly. Fortunately, foreign banks supplied smoothly. The changes in raw gold were sudden. Money exchange customers, etc., absorbed very strongly. The market price rose sharply. It was heard that it was absorbing on behalf of the Tianjin gang and the local counterfeit Huaxing Bank. Near noon, gold shops took advantage of the high price to sell. In the afternoon, money exchanges purchased and absorbed the recovery, and the supply was not smooth. The market price rose very sharply. The demand for foreign currency British and American gold pounds recovered strongly. The market price followed the high rise in raw gold and became expensive. The supply and demand of British and American gold notes were quite smooth. The demand for Hong Kong notes and Annam notes was quite strong, and the price trended upward. It was heard that it was needed by civil servants going to the southwest and passing through Hong Kong and Vietnam. Only French franc notes were supplied more heavily, and the price dropped slightly. The public association's transactions were not strong. Chengtai sold and Yongtai bought Singapore notes for 400 yuan. Sentai sold and Qintai bought Hong Kong notes for 1,000 yuan. Chengtai sold and Qintai bought Hong Kong notes for 500 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds each rose by 2 jiao, Hong Kong notes rose by 5 li, French franc notes fell by 7 hao and a half, Annam notes rose by 1 fen, and the others remained unchanged.

### Tianjin, Hong Kong, and Shanghai Exchange Rates Rise Slightly

(Shanghai dollar is the amount of Tianjin's receivables for 100 Shanghai legal tender)

Also, the black market price of Tianjin's counterfeit "Lianyin Notes" was 1 yuan higher than the morning opening on the 6th. 100 legal tender can buy 130 yuan of "Lianyin Notes", that is, 1 yuan of "Lianyin Notes" is only worth 7 jiao, 6 fen, 91)3 legal tender.

### Food - The Key to the Rice Market

According to the current situation, it is not a matter of supply and demand. As long as there is strict management and fair distribution, rice prices should return to normal.

Yesterday, the rice market was still chaotic. Northern japonica rice was not sampled at all, and southern japonica and Bo Dao rice were also very few on the market. Most of them were old stocks. Market prices were all in accordance with the price limit. Therefore, stores could not buy high-quality goods. At the same time, Du Yang wharf sharp rice was still out of stock. Only the Zhongguan sharp rice under Ying jurisdiction poured out in large quantities, and the price was also 14 yuan. If second-class rice such as 硠米 were sold, the price would reach 15 yuan and 45 cents. Because the black market was not restricted, it gradually soared. High-quality goods have been priced at 21 yuan, and medium-quality goods have also reached 20 yuan and 5 cents.

For this rise in rice prices, rice merchants publicized it widely, blaming hoarders for not releasing the rice. It is true that most of the rice hoarders are silver and money businesses and wealthy merchants. These people usually eat goods that are more expensive than rice, and they do not know the suffering of ordinary people who buy rice. Therefore, they only hope that the price will be high, and the higher the price, the more they will gain and the better they will enjoy. It is difficult to believe that rice merchants can really think for the people's food. Because the arrival of goods has not been cut off, and there are goods coming from the He Xia carts, why are they unwilling to sell at the price limit, but instead shout high prices and break through the price limit? Therefore, according to the current rice market situation, there is sufficient rice in storage, and the arrival of goods is constant. It cannot be said that the relationship between supply and demand is unbalanced. It is all because of the hoarding and profiteering of hoarders, the manipulation of rice merchants in the name of others, and the unwillingness of vendors to sample. In a word, everyone wants to make a fortune from the people's food. This kind of situation is not difficult to break, and it can be brought back to the right track. As long as there is strict management and fair distribution, hoarders, rice merchants, and vendors will not be without profit, and the people's food will not be difficult. Rice merchants can blame hoarders, and hoarders can blame rice merchants. Even if the rice of hoarders is all in the hands of rice merchants, can we guarantee that there will be no manipulation and monopoly? Who really believes it? However, to achieve these two points, the industry association alone cannot achieve it, which is also inevitable.

Foreign rice has gradually increased in the continuous rise of rice prices. Yesterday, the retail and wholesale of Saigon rice were all reported to have risen. High-quality old Saigon rice was priced at 19 yuan and 23 cents, and the transaction price was also around 19 yuan. Therefore, yesterday grain merchants had contacted foreign firms to inquire about prices by telegram. According to the telegram at the end of last week, the price was about 20 yuan, which was less than one yuan away from the Shanghai price. If the Shanghai market continues to rise and the production price is slightly flat, then the order can be approached. It is heard that the Ningbo gang is also in contact with 50,000 bags. Yesterday, 790 bags of rice came from Hong Kong and 200 bags of rice came from Fuzhou.

Yesterday, high-quality indica rice was not sold on the market, and Wuxiang rice, which was limited to 14 yuan, was also of great market quality. The Wuxiang rice also reached 13 yuan and 78 cents, and the Po Xiang rice was 13 yuan and 45 cents. The newly arrived Yuzhou coarse indica rice was priced at 11 yuan and 8 cents. In terms of selling price, high-quality indica rice was still 56 cents short. Yesterday morning, there were still new hoarders asking about it, so medium and second-class goods continued to see a hidden increase. In the afternoon market, the market hoarders took advantage of the high late hands, and the later market saw a return. The total daily turnover was 56700 bags.

### Flour - Another Wave of Price Increases

The wholesale price of this street has increased by five cents. A large batch of foreign flour is directly transported to other ports - factory flour.

Yesterday, another wave of price increases occurred in the flour market. The wholesale price of No. 2 flour factory in this street increased by five cents, the same as the customer price of 4 yuan and 5 and a half cents in cash. The difference between the wholesale price of this street and the customer gang has been several days. Yesterday was the beginning of the week, and each factory shouted high prices on the opening day due to the high price of raw materials and insufficient flour reserves. However, the sales market of the customer gang was flat, and the Beiyang gang had foreign flour to handle due to the exchange rate relationship, so they had no intention of taking more in the new transaction, only sporadic embellishments and adding thousands of bags of No. 3 and No. 4 flour. Therefore, the customer price could not be increased again, only the wholesale price in this street was increased to show consistency. The total market turnover of various brands of flour was about 50,000 bags. In addition to the transaction between this customer, the retail sales of the inland gang have not been lonely recently, so the market may still be optimistic. It is found that 11,200 bags of flour were exported today, heading to Fuzhou.

Foreign Flour

The market situation of foreign flour continued to be calm. It is found that except for a part of the new arrivals that are waiting for the price to sell, a large number of arrivals are directly transferred to North China and other places, and transported and sold to other ports. Therefore, the supply of market sources is still scarce, and the freight side insists as before. The price of medium-grade brands is 4 yuan and 5 and a half cents in cash, including the cost, which is similar to the selling price of this factory's flour. The foreign production price is still high, and the scheduled foreign flour is priced at 2 yuan and 8 cents in US dollars. However, the market rumor has a 4 yuan and 4 and a half cents scheduled foreign flour for sale, but no transaction has been heard.

### Oil Cake - In Two Weeks, Soybeans Have Fallen Sharply by Nine Yuan - Scheduled and Spot Cakes Have Also Fallen

Soybean Oil

Since the futures sale was stopped, the Japanese side has entered a state of rest. Therefore, general speculators lack the skills to fuel the flames. Under the situation that spot oil is coming to Shanghai in a continuous stream, the sales market has suddenly become sluggish. In these two weeks, soybean oil has fallen by a total of nine yuan. This kind of wind and rain storm-like rise and fall is justified by the special environment, and the industry is also actively working to say that there is no manipulation, who can believe it? Yesterday, there was no transaction in peanut oil. Only 120 barrels of Dalian oil were traded, and the price fell from 40 yuan and 8 cents to 40 yuan at the close. The sales market was in the mainland of this street.

Yesterday, 5,000 cans of raw oil came from Hong Kong, and 2,700 bags of soybeans came from Tianjin, and 2,200 bags came from Yantai. Today, 600 bags are being transported to Fuzhou.

Soybean Cake

The transaction is still only for Dalian goods. Although the spot cake is not in a time of large-scale digestion, the retail sales are still uninterrupted. The market situation only had fractional ups and downs in the score last week. Yesterday, the market fell because the June futures cake fell by 3 cents, causing the lower end to be affected. The transaction only settled 1,000 pieces of Shimei brand, the price was 2 yuan and 8 cents and a half, which was also 3 cents lower than last Saturday. The futures cake also only had transactions in June. Yesterday's market price fell from 3 yuan and 2 and a half cents (specifying Yuanji brand delivery) to 3 yuan and 5 cents, with a total turnover of 7,000 pieces. The price for the delivery of miscellaneous brand cakes was 3 yuan to 2 yuan and 9 cents and 8 cents, with a turnover of 2,000 pieces.

### Securities - Bond Market Does Not Get Rid of Sideways Movement

The black market for securities remained sideways yesterday. In the morning, it turned from flat to firm, then gradually weakened. In the afternoon, it turned from flat to weak, then slightly firmer again. However, the range of highs and lows was only between one and one and a half cents. The trend was completely caused by people's confusion and the unwillingness of both bulls and bears to give way, which led to this stagnant situation. If there is no significant change in the environment, the market price will not have huge ups and downs. Yesterday, the sellers who opened the market included No. 14, 38, 11 and Dafeng Shunli, and the buyers included Datong Tongkang and No. 20. The market price weakened slightly and then rose, and firmed slightly and then fell, and finally remained sideways between one cent. The afternoon trading was very clear, only Dingzhong had more transactions due to the lottery relationship. This kind of government bond was the last day before the seventh lottery, and the lottery will be held on the 10th, so there were more buyers. Yongfeng and No. 42 slightly absorbed, and Tiansheng Runli slightly released. The market price was still flat and unremarkable, and the result was still inconsistent in highs and lows, and the turnover was only more than 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Today is the 59th National Humiliation Memorial Day, and the market is closed for one day.

In stock trading, more than 70 shares of Huashang Electric shares were traded at a price of 5 yuan and 5 cents, slightly firmer than before by one cent.

The stock market of Zhongye Gongsuo is the most firm in several selected stocks, such as the Yesong stock and the Ruiteng stock, because it is expected that there will be good dividends, resulting in new high goods, and the Ruiteng stock has a huge turnover. The public bus stock also rose to a new high price of 30 yuan. The reclamation stock transaction is also smooth, but the price does not rise and fall greatly. The Shanghai Silver Company stock is dim, the Jardine stock is calm, and the rubber stock is difficult to trade, because the buying price and the selling price are too far apart.

The ordinary shares of China Business Company saw a turnover of 3 cents today. However, according to its reorganization plan, the 8% bonds should be worth 79 taels, while the turnover on Saturday was only 56 taels. It is unknown whether the value of ordinary shares is too high or the value of 8% bonds is too low. Therefore, it is very surprising, but there is no doubt that it will be worth the same in the future.

### Please See How Difficult Life Is Today

Meat is expensive... Those who can eat meat may not feel it is expensive. It is also expensive... Therefore, ordinary people feel great pain in life.

Since the outbreak of the August 13th War in Shanghai, people's lives have suddenly increased. In addition to the sharp rise in rents due to the sudden increase in population, the daily necessities in the family have also continued to rise. As for the food necessary for life, such as rice, vegetables, and "the seven things to open the door, firewood, rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea", none of them have not risen. For example, the fresh meat of meat dishes and the essence of legs are one yuan per catty, and you can only buy one catty and two liang for each yuan in the middle rib, and each live chicken is one catty, two or three liang per yuan, and fresh fish also costs from three or four cents to eight or nine cents per catty. As for the cheapest vegetarian food that ordinary people regard as "bean sprouts and salted vegetable tofu" and other things, the price of raw materials such as soybeans and raw soybean oil is now soaring due to the manipulation of the Japanese. In early spring of this year, 5 catties and 7 or 8 taels of raw soybean oil could be bought for each yuan, but now only less than 3 catties can be bought, so the cheapest food is not cheap now. The recent price increases of food are recorded on the left.

(1) The price of each item in the Tofu shop (unit corner)

(2) The selling price of each item in the Noodle shop (unit text)

(3) The cheapest vegetarian dishes in the vegetable market (unit corner)

The selling price of the above-listed vegetarian dishes has increased by two-thirds compared with before the war, and some have doubled. For example, tofu was sold for ten texts per piece before, but now it costs twenty texts. Dried tofu was fifteen texts per piece, and now it is sold for thirty texts. Salted vegetables and bean sprouts can be bought for at least forty or fifty texts, but now it costs at least four or five cents. The hardship of the public's life is all given by the invaders.

### Yarn Flowers - More Than One Slice of the Cutting Knot Sound Now, the Yarn Price Plunges Ten Yuan - There Is a Feeling That Yesterday Was Right and Today Is Wrong

The yarn market continued to be tired and the falling wind rose again. Although the actual demand was more than the previous day, there was still no huge development. In addition, some bigwigs were thinking about the possibility of a callback, and after the first-class fell cheaply, they would buy it again. Therefore, people's hearts were flat, and the market went down in a roundabout way. The eastern Zhejiang Wenzhou area has already started to transport by wheel. It must wait for it to return to Shanghai. If the road is safe, there may be a better business improvement in the middle of this week. Therefore, the current mainstream opinion is to hold a hopeful attitude. In the afternoon, the virtual wind suddenly rose, and the decline was rapid. The floating more than saw the bad environment and all cut the knot. The 20-count double horse foreign warehouse goods fell below the 420 yuan mark, and the warehouse single goods also tracked down, entering the 10 yuan mark. In this situation, it can be imagined that the operators are confused. It has created a situation of rapid advance and retreat.

The current yarn situation, at the beginning of the morning, colleagues gathered together, and the discussion was weak. Because the actual needs of all roads were cold, there was no telegram commission, and the market was showing a hesitant trend. The opening fell by one and a half yuan, and the price of 20-count Bianma warehouse single was 416 yuan. However, since the spot price was tired, the purchasers were even more rare, and the price was 423 yuan. After a while, the general mobile brokers shouted and sold in the market like an auction. The market gradually declined. By the time the market closed, the spot price was 418 yuan, and the warehouse single price was 412 yuan and a half. When the market opened in the afternoon, the sellers gathered, and the buyers were scattered and unbearable. The 20-count Te Jincheng spot yarn Yunnan gang entered 20 packages, and the price was 8 yuan lower than the morning price. People's hearts suddenly became fearful, and a selling wind suddenly rose, and the selling price continued to fall. The closing price of Shuangma spot was 415 yuan, and the warehouse single price was 406 yuan and a half. This kind of falling wind is too violent to avoid. In fact, the price increase in the past was excessive, and yesterday's reflection was even more dramatic. It is found that all the gangs bought a total of 1,895 packages, and the market price of 20-count double horse yarn fell by 8 yuan, the double earth fell by 10 yuan, the Te Jincheng fell by 10 yuan, and the 10-count coarse yarn also fell by 34 yuan. Today, 71 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, and 87 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong yesterday, and there were still 75 pieces. The amount bought by each gang is listed separately as follows.

Colleagues 1,285 Hong Kong 155 Mainland 35

Yunnan 130 Shantou 110 Total 1,895

The market price of Japanese yarn has been declining frequently yesterday, which is the reaction of the rise in the past. The number of people in the market has been greatly reduced compared to before, and the momentum is cold. However, the selling price is declining day by day, because there is no need for all parties, and some people say that cotton weaving factories have sold out, because the price of yarn is good, and the profit of weaving into cloth is not as thick as raw goods. In this situation, spot yarn cannot stand. The 20-count Yueqin yarn has been in a slump in the front and back markets, and the closing price is 363 yuan, which is 12 yuan lower than the previous day.

### Although the Foreign Market Is High, Brazilian Cotton Still Has Transactions

The foreign cotton market price, the New York cotton market, is quite active. The government's loan cotton loan release problem has not been confirmed for the spot on the market. However, the previous saying of export subsidies caused all parties to purchase, so the spot on the market is decreasing day by day. Recently, the transaction of colleagues is very prosperous, and the short sellers have also made up a large number of them. As a result, the closing price rose by 6 to 10 pounds. India quickly predicted that it would fall by 1 rupee, (but according to the latest news, the Indian market price rose by 2 rupees today,) Egypt stopped the market, and the exchange rate did not change much. The legal currency was converted, and the US cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 5 cents per burden, the Egyptian cotton rose by 5 cents, and the Indian cotton fell by more than 8 cents.

Shanghai's foreign cotton transaction, because the overseas cotton market has been rising for days, the transaction of each factory has temporarily stopped. However, the Japanese side is still buying fiercely in the market. Yesterday, Brazilian cotton still had transactions, and they were all ordered by commercial companies, and they were all delivered in June, and the exchange was about 85 yuan per group. There will be two rounds of shipments from the US to Shanghai this week, with a total of more than 16,000 packages. The following is a list of the spot price of the cotton market that was converted and sent to the factory yesterday.

The local cotton business is still very depressed, and the selling price is not much different from the previous day. The factory's needs are very slow, and it probably only uses the goods that arrive. Therefore, the purchase of local cotton is as rare as a phoenix feather. In fact, the factories that lack goods, even if they have the intention to do so, have no way to start. Therefore, they are hesitant to move forward. The source of northern Jiangsu has arrived in Tongzhou for more than 300 packages in two days. The following is a record of the current cotton situation.

### The Price of Yarn Rises and Falls Greatly

It is an inevitable result of human creation.

In recent days, the market price of the current market has been turbulent, with storms and rains. The reasons are as follows.

(1) The market price of the current yarn before the spring rose was hovering between 38, 9 and 10 yuan. At this time, South China and Guangxi received commissions, and there were 5,000 packages of 20-count double horse Tiannv brand in all directions. There were still 2,000 packages, which were followed by merchants, with a total of 7,000 packages. The price of handling goods was probably the most at 38, 9 and 10 yuan. It was decided that outside of 400 yuan, the yarn market would be more solid, and the market would be prosperous.

(2) The actual position of the yarn market, speculators suddenly came to activity. At the same time, the "Japanese puppet" Huaxing Bank was established, and there were various rumors in the market. Therefore, buyers fueled the flames and scrambled to buy, as long as they bought in, they created a peak of 450 yuan. Unexpectedly, the degree of rise was too violent, and the actual sales were helpless. The chips were overflowing, and the falling wind was strong. Yesterday, the price had broken the 20 yuan mark, which was 415 yuan, which was a huge difference of 35 yuan from the high price on Monday last week. In fact, the rise in the past was all due to the strong sales, and most of the recent rise was caused by human beings. Therefore, once the cracks appeared, it was like a river going down the drain. The fundamental problem is still the amount of consumption, which is the standard for the rise and fall of the market price. If we rely solely on human power to do it, it will be difficult to last.

### Piece Goods - The Falling Wind of Dongyi Is Turning Fierce - The Sales of National Cloth to Customers Are Clear and Dull

National Cloth

The market situation is tired, and the actual sales to customers have not improved. People's hearts have turned to the lower reaches. The rise in wind before the week was too violent, causing the public to hoard, and it was in stark contrast to the rise in wind due to the supply exceeding demand during the peak sales period. At this time, the actual sales are becoming more and more clear and dull, and the selling price of retail investors is unusually loose and bad. However, the number of pieces is very fragmented, and the attitude of general hoarders is calm, so the return wind of the cloth market is not fierce. The selling price of fine cloth, fine twill, and group cloth has fallen by 5 cents to 12 cents per piece, and the price of bleached and dyed cloth has also fallen by 12 cents. The sales of fine cloth and fine twill in the Ben Street, Jiangbei Gang, and Xiang Gang were more than 50 pieces, and more than 60 pieces of coarse cloth. The retail and disassembled white cloth bag transactions in the Ben Street Jiangzhe Guerrilla Area were endless, with more than 3,300 pieces arriving yesterday. The National Army-controlled areas in northern Jiangsu, Taizhou, and Xinghua also handled nearly 1,000 pieces, with light-colored cloth, poplin, ramie yarn, colored cloth, and printed cloth as the majority. The new additions of the Chuan, Dian, and Guangdong gangs were consistent and scarce, and the orders were still being shipped vigorously. Although the navigation to Wenzhou and Dinghai in eastern Zhejiang has resumed, there are still many obstacles to selling goods, so the loading of goods is extremely small, which is a trial operation.

Dong Cloth

After the white goods rebounded at the end of last week, the sales of colored cloth in the market declined yesterday, and retail investors scrambled to sell, and the falling wind turned tight. At the morning market, the spot price of Longtou fine cloth was 13 yuan and 9 cents, and the wood and moon futures opened at 14 yuan and 2 cents and a half, and then fell to 14 yuan and 1 cent. The spot price also once reached 13 yuan and 8 cents, which was 23 cents lower than last week per piece. Baobei fine twill also fell by 3 cents, opening at 12 yuan, 5 and a half cents to 6 cents. The industry did not open the goods, and the Ben Street turnover was 5600 pieces. The big hoarders still tried their best to raise the goods.

Export

On the 9th, the export of piece goods was 78 pieces to Fuzhou, 15 pieces to Shantou, and 25 pieces to Hong Kong.

### Silk Tea - Yokohama Silk Sets New High Price Again

Shanghai Silk Factory Has Difficulty Collecting Cocoons, Which Is Also One of the Reasons for Following the Rise.

Yesterday, the New York market was closed on Sunday, and the price of Yokohama silk set a new record high again. The spot price was 1,290 yuan, up 15 yuan, and the forward price was 1,155 yuan, up 19 yuan. The market atmosphere was stable. General speculation is that it will rise above 1,300 yuan. The spring silkworms are about to come up, and the output in Japan will not be abundant. In addition, the currency inflation in their country is increasing, so the conditions for the rise in silk prices are more complete.

The silk market in this port was very prosperous yesterday, but the US sales were relatively quiet, so the French silk market became the focus. Yesterday, the price of 2022 threads of the Bai Factory without Iwinas was 1,770 yuan. Da Feng Cheng Chang and other banks purchased nearly 100 loads in total. The silk price from the British bank was also high, and the grade of Bai Factory Qixing was 1,880 yuan, which can be called an unprecedented market price. There were only Zhili transactions at the New York bank, and six banks sold it for 1,000 yuan, which was another 20 yuan increase. The silk factories in this port have not yet found a proper way to buy spring cocoons. Recently, the cocoon factories in the occupied areas have been destroyed by guerrillas, and 40 cocoon factories have been burned in Hai Ning alone, so as not to be used by others. However, the guerrilla areas have not yet found a possible way to collect cocoons. It is inevitable that it will be difficult to carry legal currency to the inland to collect cocoons and pass through the closure money. It makes the general manufacturers hesitate to move forward. Therefore, the price of silk in this port has been rising day by day, which is not only due to the overseas increase and the relationship between the reserves.

### Huzhou New Tea Is Shipped to Shanghai

Since the interruption of traffic, there has been no new tea from Zhejiang Province to the port. It is known that a large amount of new tea has been transferred from Hangzhou Station to the port yesterday. Among them, except for 34 packages of De Changxiang, which have begun to be baked, the rest are also preparing to be unloaded. It is heard that the new goods are handled by Sian Shangbei in Huzhou. The mountain price is high, and the shipping cost to Shanghai is worth more than 130 yuan per load. In addition, the cost of work is huge. After the sample is made in three or five days, the foreign firm will have a formal new market. The mountain prices in various places, except for Shangyu and Wenzhou, have been reported in the previous report. It is heard that the mountain price of Tangxi tea is more than 110 yuan. In short, this year's mountain prices have broken the peak record of previous years.

Tea Hua came from Hong Kong on the 8th with 800 pieces, and 28 boxes were shipped to Hong Kong on the 9th.

### Sugar Market - Coarse White Returns to Good by Four Corners - More Than 10,000 Pieces of Sugar Are Imported

According to the London telegram of the previous day, the coarse white has slightly returned to good, and the Hong Kong telegram package fee has also risen to the Shanghai office, and the handling price has also risen by four corners to 20 yuan and 2 corners. Therefore, after the Shanghai market suddenly rose and fell, it has turned better again. The association's drawing plate, the spot price of 24 coarse white goods in the current warehouse rose by four corners, drawing 28 yuan and 3 corners, the price of goods in the foreign warehouse rose by three corners and a half, which was 28 yuan and 1 corner, and the price of goods in the customs warehouse rose by five corners, and 600 packages were traded at 20 yuan and 1 corner. Those that will arrive on the 13th on the road are 23 yuan and 3 corners, and 800 packages were traded. The Taikoo Che Bai rose by one corner, the B-mark west warehouse goods were 28 yuan and 2 corners, the east warehouse was 28 yuan, and the Dutch red and local cotton white remained unchanged. Guotang has a Chao gang that opened 60 packages of ordinary cotton red, 16 yuan and 3 corners, and 670 packages of Huanggang Qing, opened 15 yuan and 3 corners, and the high goods called 15 yuan and a half, but failed to become.

### Vegetarianism

— Mao Lie

Anyone who wants to achieve something must have the following positive conditions: spirit first, material second, and form third. This is almost an iron law. If China wants to resist Japan and build the country, the main conditions are no exception. The recently launched spiritual mobilization can be said to be a probing step in the resistance against Japan and the construction of the country.

Today is the longest and most important National Humiliation Memorial Day in China. In the past years, in a corner of Shanghai, there were flag-lowering and other commemorative actions. The situation is special this year. People from all walks of life in China have agreed not to lower the flag on this day, nor to hold any gatherings, but to be vegetarian for a day to show mourning. This is indeed a good way.

Lowering the flag is a form, and form can also represent spirit, and it is sometimes very necessary. However, when this form cannot be held, when weighing the advantages and disadvantages, naturally it is better to abandon the form and focus on the spirit. As long as there is such a clean victory, bearing the burden of humiliation and vowing to avenge the country, even if there are some flaws in form or even material, it doesn't matter. What's more, in addition to lowering the flag, there are other commemorative methods, vegetarianism.

In Chinese customs, vegetarianism is a sign of piety and grief. It is very appropriate to be vegetarian to mark shame with a painful heart; it is especially appropriate to be vegetarian to cleanse shame with a pious heart. Vegetarianism is also equivalent to sleeping on firewood and tasting courage. The Chinese people, especially those in Shanghai, who does not remember this shame? Then, everyone should be vegetarian. This is equivalent to the form of lowering the flag, but it also contains the essence of tenacious struggle, and it can also contribute to the required materials. Why not be vegetarian?

Germany wanted to cleanse the shame of the Treaty of Versailles, and its people did not eat white-mixed beef, tightened their belts, and saved money to build planes and cannons. This is equivalent to long-term vegetarianism. If the Chinese people can be vegetarian on this day, and donate the money saved to the country, the amount must be considerable, and it will help the strength of the resistance, it will not be small!

In fact, on this day, the Chinese people should even fast, let alone be vegetarian. Because if everyone still does not know how to be ashamed and work hard, the result of national subjugation is certain; if the country is subjugated and people are not forced to be unable to eat, or have nothing to eat, they will inevitably be like the Jews. On the anniversary of the kingdom's subjugation, they will always fast for a day automatically. If there is a spirit of fasting now and persevering to the end, I believe that even being vegetarian will become unnecessary in the future.

Those who mourn will surely win, and vegetarianism is also to express mourning. Those who have a belief in victory should be happy to be vegetarian!

### Surpassing the Preceding Generation

— Ding Ti

We accept the next task, inheriting it from the preceding generation.

Human history is a tapestry woven with the blood of struggle, with the martyrdom of heroes and the foul corruption of demons. It is like the battle of dragons and snakes, locked in combat for millions of years, with light and darkness taking each other's place. There is no eternal light, nor is there perpetual darkness.

Righteous people sacrifice themselves in struggle, seizing light from the hands of "evil." When the spark of light is snatched away by the "wicked," the universe transforms into a hell—deep, dark, and bitterly cold. There is no sun, no moon, no stars, no fire. The timid are frozen like autumn insects, groaning, weeping, lamenting, and quietly dying in despair. The brave, the steadfast, the enlightened, unable to submit to fate, rise up, baring their arms, willing to consign their flesh and blood to the mountain streams; in this way, they build a bridge, so that their descendants can cross the deep ravines, traverse the dark valleys, and climb to the mountaintops.

With the spark of light in hand, the "evil" world falls to the brave, the steadfast, the enlightened, the seekers of light.

Like hibernating insects, hiding in silence, "evil" never disappears completely. Given the opportunity, it will seize the chance to rise up from the soil, from beneath the roots of trees. Thus, "evil," though seemingly dead, will be reborn. In human history, the struggle between dragons and snakes is emphasized once more.

Because the root of "evil" is never completely severed, "righteousness" can never be at peace. Light ascends into the sky, but darkness quietly creeps upon the earth; "morality" barely wearies before the clown tries to strangle it to death; the small boat of "justice" sailing on the vast ocean is constantly threatened by cruel crocodiles seeking to devour it.

"Evil" never repents. Those who indulge "evil" are often harmed by it before long. At this time, those who assist the wicked in their cruelty, the accomplices of evil, the flatterers, are unwilling to praise decaying righteousness any longer. They call it: cowardice, incompetence, the way of natural selection.

When "evil" is ascendant, we are easily infected and attacked, so we want to build a fortress of righteousness to defend ourselves.

For thousands of years, we have felt that the fortress left by our ancestors is half-destroyed and half-unstable. "Evil" may invade at any time. Although we may temporarily repel it, it is not eliminated. For lasting peace, we build a new fortress, greater and stronger.

We erect high wooden frames, tie long ropes, and use heavy stones, striking them down with force. We strike, strike, driving piles—driving piles. For the sake of righteousness, thousands of years ago and thousands of years from now, we lay a foundation that is deep, thick, broad, and eternally unshakable.

Sweat drips from our foreheads, our hands and feet are calloused. This is truly a bitter task. Our predecessors would not do it, our friends have not done it, but we, in these difficult times, shoulder it with iron-like shoulders.

"If it's just for self-defense, then it's enough to repel 'evil.' Why build a greater, stronger fortress?" Some mock us for being too busy, for not knowing how to take shortcuts. But we don't care about these things. We are willing to sacrifice ourselves for lasting righteousness. Protecting ourselves, even more so protecting our friends; planning for ourselves, even more so for our descendants.

Not only must we lay a deeper foundation, but we must also engage "evil" in close combat, clearing away the defeated insects, extinguishing the dying embers. For the sake of the universe, for thousands of years to come, we filter it into a clear pool of water, removing the eternal sediment.

Although our predecessors also had a fortress, and they also drove out "evil," now the fortress is about to collapse, and "evil" has not been eliminated. Those who have passed have passed, taking with them laughter, tears, sunny days and cloudy days, sorrow and happiness, leaving behind the fragrance of *Du Ruo*, and also leaving behind the stench of *Peng Hao*. The walls of "righteousness" are erected, but the snakes of "evil" are stirring again, swaying, swaying. Don't you see that the giant boars and long snakes are constantly eyeing us, wanting to swallow the light in one gulp? Tell me, can we continue to be complacent?

This is not a time for complacency, nor is it a time to retreat. Even a single spark can start a prairie fire. Where "evil" is buried, mankind can never be at peace.

Unearth what is buried there; capture and destroy the "evil" beneath the ground; build a deep and strong fortress. For the sake of other evil people, and for the sake of yourself.

Cleanse the universe of thousands and thousands of years, leaving not a single trace of "evil." The dead and putrid, cleanse them from the tombs of the "past," the remnants of the evil legacy, we tear off the masks of "today."

When chasing and attacking, we are the vanguard; when building a fortress, we are the first to raise high the pile-driving stone.

Sow the seeds of "righteousness," and one day they will blossom, blessing the people of the world. Let us build a fortress of happiness.

Since "evil" was not eliminated in the preceding generation, our work must surpass that of the preceding generation, so that it will never be reborn.

### One Wave Subsides, Another Rises

### Hope

— Liu You

Hope is the most beautiful flower of all mankind, the purest water in the universe, it will refresh the dry air of the world!

Hope lives forever in people's hearts, it can help people pursue light, it is not lazy, not afraid of being busy or facing difficulties!

Most gratifying is the song of hope, that loud and magnificent voice, shaking everything:

"Our surroundings will not be dead and沉沉, we have hope, which can make it flourish!"

Anxious hearts, wisps of sorrow, bursts of grief, as long as you step on the road of hope, everything will be active!

Hope is a boundless ocean, hope is a lofty peak, it encompasses everything!

Ignite the flower of hope, not for the illusory golden land, the peach blossom creek, which can drive people crazy, they are forever isolated from humanity. Even the bravest adventurers cannot find that world, it is a temptation!

Our hope is survival - the most needed thing for humanity.

We have hope, without waiting, we want to create a road towards the only hope, without hesitation, without fear!

This hope is the most precious thing in our lives (charity donation)

### Mourning Wu Mei

— Hu Shanyuan

Mr. Wu Quan'an passed away in southern Yunnan two or three months ago. There have been several articles in various newspapers commemorating him. More than ten days ago, the National Government issued an order to commend him and grant a special pension. For an old professor, reaching this stage can be said to be posthumous honor. Some of my friends who know that I had some dealings with him have said, why haven't I said a word about his passing? Moreover, I have never seen an article mourning him in *Ziyoutan* either?

Indeed, I spent five years at the World Book Company compiling "The Complete Collection of Song Lyrics," totaling more than 260 types, which had already been typeset and was just waiting to be printed. In addition, I compiled "An Integrated Collection of Discussions on *Qu*," which collected more than 30 types of *Qu* discussions, all of which had been proofread, and I asked him to write a preface for me, which he was kind enough to praise. Unexpectedly, with the sound of gunfire on August 13th, I and my colleagues at the bookstore hurriedly left Yangshupu. Many manuscripts could not be taken away. These five years of my hard work and the bookstore's capital resulted in two massive works, which had to be left at the main factory on Dalian Xiao Road; of course, the preface he wrote for "An Integrated Collection of Discussions on *Qu*," like the preface Mr. Xia Chengtao wrote for "The Complete Collection of Song Lyrics," is now nowhere to be found. Because of this, in addition to generally mourning him as the academic world losing another great master of *Qu* studies, I especially want to mourn him. It's just that I have been busy and restless, and I have been delaying it, not realizing it. This makes me regret it. Now, I have finally completed a set of Northern *Qu* tunes to mourn him. I know it is like showing off one's axe in front of Lu Ban, not worthy of high regard, but since I have a sincere heart, and he once recognized me as a fellow enthusiast of *Qu*, perhaps he will respond.

Mr. Wu's given name was Mei, his courtesy name was Jun'an; later he changed it to Quan'an, with the sobriquets Linggu and Shuangyai. He was from Suzhou. In recent years, he served as a professor at Central University. His works include "The Legend of Fengdong," "The Legend of Xuehuafei," "The Legend of Xiangzhen Pavilion," "Random Talks on Appreciating *Qu*," "Simplified Notation of Southern and Northern Nine Palaces," "Quye in the Shemota Room," and "Selected Excellent *Jia Qu* Songs," etc. After August 13th, he first took refuge in Mutian Town in the countryside of Suzhou, at the home of my friend Gu Yongru. Later, when Central University reopened in Sichuan, he traveled to Sichuan with the school, and then followed the school to Yunnan, until his death, at the age of fifty-seven. A detailed biography will certainly be written by someone. Here, I will only briefly mention these things as references for the eulogy below.

(Zhong Lü Fen Die Er) The tragic news is spread, looking south to Yunnan, where the light is no longer seen. The banished immortal returns to the distant heavens. The willows are gentle, the spring is silent, the sorrow is difficult to dispel. The flute's melody is melancholic, how can the falling plum blossoms bear to be blown everywhere?

(Zui Chun Feng) His character is like plum blossoms, refined; his temperament is like cranes, distant. He always entrusted his traces to Shuangyai. Now, he is nowhere to be seen. Seen, the fog obscures the mountains in front. Where the cuckoos cry, fallen flowers form a carpet.

(Ying Xian Ke) The Qunyu Palace, the small pearl boat, the selected *Qu* tunes, the vast collection of *Qu*. Fengdong's heroism, Xiangzhen's collection, how many surviving works, all suffer from the war.

(Hong Xiu Xie) Spring is like a thread under the Stone City. Peach and plum blossoms bloom, the skirts and shoes dance lightly. The leader of the literary circle year after year. Unexpectedly, the bloody wind blows the sea, and the torrential rain submerges the mulberry fields. Only the swaying curtain is left, drifting everywhere.

(Shi Er Yue) Searching for the gate, in front of Changchun Lane. Resting the staff and shoes along the Mutian Creek. Mourning Qu Yuan at the foot of Linglong Mountain, visiting Xi Shi near the Liguo border. In the blink of an eye, everything becomes a past event, leaving only lingering echoes.

(Yao Min Ge) Ah, listening endlessly to the sound of the Yangtze River's ten thousand miles of waves. Seeing endlessly the towering Shu Road, like the blue sky. Early again, a load of luggage to Sichuan. Opening the mat again, sitting on the green felt. It's a pity, just when Du Huanhua was leaving the Gorge, it turned out to be Fu Xian's wish to ride a crane.

(Yao Hai Er) All because the Shu River boils and the Shu Mountains tremble. And flowing to southern Yunnan. Spring sorrow is dark, unable to sleep. Thoughts are always grievances. Knowing that the rebirth of the nation will eventually be fulfilled. Helplessly, growing old, wandering, only pitying oneself. Difficult to dispel, clouds vast, the soul fading at Chicken Foot Mountain, water vast, dreams broken at Erhai Lake.

(Wei Sheng) Mourning the war dead, thoughts are confused. Writing new lyrics, the sentences are not beautiful. Hoping for the day when the Royal Army pacifies the rivers and mountains in the north. Awaiting to sprinkle wine and offer a chicken at the grave.

### Wusong Road Project

(See this newspaper from the fifth month of the eleventh year of the Guangxu reign)

North of Yangshupu, directly to Wusong Town, Western merchants are building a road, winding for dozens of miles, forty feet wide, using people's fields, with compensation given. In the early stages of this project, when building a bridge at a road intersection, villagers repeatedly pulled out the piles. After the Consul-General sent a letter to the Shen Official, who instructed Chen Sima to investigate and explain, the situation was complicated by the clamoring of women. Later, Chen Sima gathered the headmen of various districts and repeatedly persuaded them to give a large price for the use of private land. The project was divided into sections, and local villagers in each area were assigned to build the road on their own land, with labor costs still paid. For the first section of the project, silver was paid in accordance with regulations, and construction was carried out. The villagers gladly engaged in the work. The latter part of the project had already crossed into the territory of Baoshan County. The Austrian Deputy Minister, Xia Gong, distinguished between the roads and the remote areas, and gave silver ranging from 270 to 300 taels per mu. Where there were actual obstacles to buildings, demolition fees were added. Local headmen and property owners were gathered together, and it was ensured that everything was voluntary, with agreements signed before construction began. For those who had been surveyed and measured, silver was immediately given, without any coercion or duress for dozens or hundreds of households. The remaining areas connected to Baoyi and the areas directly north that had not yet been determined were to be first marked with gray, forming a road pattern, so that the headmen of each district could then investigate and build accordingly. The number of fields under the names of individual households to be used could also be given the land price first. The current honorable magistrate of Baoshan, Zhang Gong, has been instructed by the official to come to Shanghai to negotiate and jointly go to the countryside for surveying and measurement.

### Swire Company Acquires Ships

It is heard that the Gongzheng Steamship Company held a meeting yesterday and decided to sell all of its ships to the Swire Shipping Company. It is scheduled that the company will be established as a trading house after March next year. It is also heard that Swire will use two new ships for the Yangtze River, which will also arrive in March next year.

### Saying a Few Words to "An Apprentice" and Others Suffering from the Same Ailment

— (Chi Qiang)

Recently, an "apprentice" expressed the hope that society would establish correspondence schools, allowing him or them to read a little during their spare time. This urgent desire for knowledge has moved me greatly. As the editor of this publication said:

"—I think the issue of establishing correspondence schools is secondary. The Shanghai East Public Association sending fifty investigators to various district shops to investigate the educational level of apprentices and to implore managers or shopkeepers to allow their apprentices to study is indeed an urgent matter!"

If accomplished, this will be good news for "an apprentice" or most apprentices. They will send people to implore your managers or shopkeepers. In the future, your desire for knowledge may overcome the difficulties in this "imploring." As long as the shopkeepers and managers "allow" it, your long-cherished wishes can be fulfilled immediately.

This is a completely true matter: shop assistants, apprentices, or middle-aged people who have lost the opportunity to study, residing in the cultural center of Shanghai, constantly exposed to knowledge, there is not one who does not urgently think of the importance of seeking knowledge. They think that way, but at the same time, the clutches of life tightly grip their surroundings. Therefore, wanting the brain to absorb a little spiritual food is still not as difficult as enduring hunger. The famine of knowledge, at most, is like suffering from anemia or a chronic disease. Being able to endure it, becoming muddle-headed, joining the ranks of the illiterate, will not lead to loss of life! But if bread is lost, "death will occur in seven days"! Ancient teachings are clear and worthy of fear! This is the first point that ordinary apprentices have not dealt with clearly under the torrent of both spiritual and material food!

Secondly, during the apprenticeship, under the accumulation of habits, there seems to be a situation of "selling oneself into servitude." There is only the shop, not the apprentice; there is only the freedom of the shop or factory, not the apprentice's freedom: there is only the freedom of the shop owner or manager to plan and accelerate production, not the apprentice's freedom to cultivate their own body and mind. Therefore, life and death are determined by fate, and rolling away is destined. They will be "beasts of burden" for the rest of their lives! This is another point in the complex structure that prevents apprentices from achieving their desire for knowledge.

We can frankly say that, in the eyes of the shop or factory, apprentices seem to be a flexible tool for generating wealth; and ordinary managers and shop owners mostly embrace the ambition of "the Qin Shi Huang's policy of keeping the people ignorant." The moment an apprentice looks at a book, the machine stops there "like a white horse passing through a crack": the unified economy must naturally temporarily declare a disconnection, and the production function cannot be allowed to waver! Not only that, but proximity to ink stains one black. Once the mind is opened, the apprentice's desire advances greatly: either demanding improved treatment, or jointly starting an independent business, the production elements are destroyed midway. If another batch is recruited, not only is it considered greatly contradictory in business terms, but it is also felt to be a waste of capital, which is really too uneconomical. This is another point why apprentices want to study but shop owners and managers are unwilling to boldly let them try, leading to their inability to seek knowledge.

With these three relationships, the apprentice's schooling naturally has to implore their shop owner or manager to allow it, so those who think it is urgent, the urgency lies with the shop owner or manager, the key lies in their answering or not answering only.

Now, I wish the apprentices of Shanghai, to wait quietly and not be impatient, let educational institutions such as the Shanghai East Public Association send personnel to investigate, and to help you implore or find ways. Even the Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Education Office is based on this original intention of rescuing unemployed workers and shop assistants, and has established four vocational night schools within the concession, and also often helps unemployed apprentices to implore their factory directors, shop owners, and managers. Presumably, there are many wise and understanding factory owners, who often respond to requests and gladly comply. However, sometimes the factory adds a little "snack money" to the apprentices' pockets and implements its intensified work to seek a special surge in production, then the snowstorm of leave requests flies, and it is time for the apprentices to "steal busy during leisure." So I think the apprentice's bread and spiritual food are both important. Abandoning spiritual food and focusing solely on bread can easily lead to becoming muddle-headed, unknowingly, and sticking to one's original position in the career; as for abandoning bread and pursuing spiritual food, the west wind is ultimately not enough to satisfy hunger! To be an apprentice, one can only plan for both, and obtain both kinds of food through imploring and negotiation or permission. The national economy and people's livelihood rely on this. I wonder if apprentices find these words pleasing to their ears?

### Miscellaneous Thoughts on Reading History

— Lin Gengbai

Since the border defense autumn is urgent, the Jianghuai area sees days of disorder. The dragon war begins in the Nine Provinces, the crabs of a single surname grow fat. Empty cities are moved and resettled, the refugees are graded in status. The army labors and mouths are wearied, the long siege covers ten thousand miles. At night, I sigh over the affairs of the marshal, the pure officials compete to steal hooks. I hear nothing of punishing the two eunuchs, only of pardoning all the provinces. The blood of the generous Tian Heng, the sorrowful head of Ma Ji. The front army is still fighting, while the staff hides Qiao Zhou! The party's enemies are in the same boat, the flattering to the stove abounds. Eyes pierce through waiting for the Uyghur horses, tears are exhausted by the camels in Luoyang. The dust of the servant Yuangui, the halberd of the general Yueshi. The spirit of the radiant Gao Guang is here, eternally protecting the Han mountains and rivers! Hundreds of generations speak Xianbei language, three capitals wear Jimo boots. Riding in carriages like cranes, arrayed in ranks like geese in vain. The Jiangzuo are reveling Wang Xie, Shanxi relies on Mu Po. Even now, the Yan Zhao bandits dare not cross the Yellow River! The Beifu soldiers are still strong, the western neighbors have exhausted their envoys. Still able to rely on Jin Zheng, unable to rely on ghosts and Rong. Pacifying internally laments Chao Cuo, greedily taking credit is a mistake like that of Lü Meng. Lingering over the historical regrets, is it only selling Lulong? The Ba Shu region once revived the Han, Jingxiang did not preserve Wu. From ancient times the relationship of lip and teeth, one must cut into the diagram of the heart and stomach. The Yin is lost and Qin can recover, the ball is lost and Chu is also isolated. The army is exhausted Zhang raises the red banner, tearing the eyes to see the Donghu! I do not see the Master Zhu, I bear the trace of Bailu in vain. Officials receive half a *Shu*, hermits enjoy thousands of *Zhong*. The world is without Confucius, who can ask Duke Lu. Tomorrow on the vast sea, the world is turbulent! (Charity donation)

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

— Bao Tianxiao

Ninth Episode: Enduring Grief and Suffering, Tears are Shed in All Directions

This kind of tear-jerking drama is truly as Jin Danyun said: Why write this kind of tragedy, to make people feel sad? However, because humans are the most emotional animals, the more tragic and moving the drama, the more people want to watch it. Many things in dramas, knowing that they are castles in the air, there is no such thing, just writers creating them from imagination, from the pen. However, seeing the tragedy of life and death separations, the heroic and tragic sacrifices, even a clever person will shed tears. People say: when reading books, one worries for the ancients, now when watching dramas, one truly grieves for the people in the play. For example, Jin Danyun said: Why this kind of tragedy, but telling her not to watch it, she will definitely not want to. There are even those who laugh at themselves, why do they have to cry, it is truly inexplicable. Moreover, today this Miss Lin, performed really well, her tears, I don't know where they came from, naturally and truly tears flowed non-stop. Because they were true tears, the people watching the play accompanied her tears, truly like the ancient poem says: "The Red Chamber's tears are angrier than the tide." This play finished, it was already twelve o'clock, Wu Junsu then invited Zhu Airen, Jin Danyun, He Shuangyu, Li Wang to her room. According to Junsu's meaning, it was rare that they all came, tomorrow is a Sunday, she wanted them to stay here for one day. Helplessly, Zhu Airen was eager to accompany the He sisters to Zishan Village, taking advantage of that Sunday being a rest day, after this day, she would be busy with work again. Airen also briefly told Junsu about the He sisters going to survey the land to build a silk weaving factory, and she was also very happy. Thinking that the He sisters, since they are starting a business here, they can often gather together. As for Jin Danyun on the other hand, she was also eagerly wanting to return to Shanghai. Because Mrs. Sulia, no matter how big or small, wanted to ask Miss Jin. Miss Jin was not only her senior advisor, but simply her secretary. According to Mrs. Sulia's intentions, it would be best to ask Jin Danyun to resign from the post of entertaining foreign guests under the National Diplomacy Committee, and be hired exclusively by her. But Jin Danyun refused to agree. She was willing to serve the public, to do her part for the country, but was unwilling to work for Mrs. Sulia personally. Although in terms of remuneration, Mrs. Sulia's side, the treatment would be several times better than her current position. But Jin Danyun kept the heart of serving the country, and the National Diplomacy Committee was unwilling to let Miss Jin resign. And Mrs. Sulia gifted Miss Jin a lot of property, she also declined them all, she said: she has enough to use, she doesn't need extra wealth. (105)

Life Report

### Apprentices in Retail Stores

— Zhi Bai

In the Spring and Autumn column a few days ago, I saw a letter from an apprentice to the editor, in which he expressed his hope of being able to attend compulsory school in the evenings. This request is indeed good, but in reality, it may still be impossible – especially in retail stores. Moreover, how can one expect it under the hands of bosses who only care about making profits and not the future of their apprentices? The author is also a small clerk, so he can very well understand the daily life of ordinary apprentices. Therefore, he writes this out, hoping that the bosses will allow apprentices the opportunity to study, so as not to bury their aspirations. In ordinary retail shops, they open at seven or eight o'clock in the morning. However, general cigarette and paper shops and candy stores open particularly early in order to meet the needs of the morning market. For example, cigarette and paper shops have many people coming to buy breakfast dishes and cigarettes as soon as it dawns. At the same time, the chief cooks and maids from the vegetable markets also come to exchange money in order to buy the food they need. Candy stores cater to office workers and students going to school, who come to buy bread, butter, milk, etc., so they must open early as well. Moreover, the people who deliver bread from the factories are particularly early, so apprentices have to get up especially early to open the store door, sweep the floor, wipe the tables and chairs, and tidy up the goods – which is also what they should do.

The other stores originally used this time as their morning practice for calligraphy, but in cigarette and paper shops and candy stores, business is naturally more important due to the busyness. Moreover, some lazy female bosses sometimes even ask them to buy groceries and cook. In the afternoon, it is even the busiest time in the market, and they are simply busy like this until eleven or twelve o'clock at night. Especially in the summer candy stores, they still have to deliver goods at night, because there are particularly many people buying soda and beer in the evening, so apprentices have even less opportunity for self-study! Alas! What exactly do they learn? At the same time, the bosses are also not understanding and are unwilling to hire an extra experienced clerk. They would rather pay less and have the apprentices take on this extra work. Therefore, apprentices can only forever groan under the oppression of selfish managers and bosses!

Although the author's life is better than that of apprentices now, the time for self-study is already after ten o'clock in the evening when I am exhausted, and I still have to endure many setbacks. Therefore, I implore all capitalists not to hinder the future of apprentices for their own selfish interests, and to at least come up with a way to give them time for self-study or night school.

### An Opinion on Hanging Flags

— Mou

Some time ago, there was a misunderstanding about hanging the national flag. After negotiations between the municipal chamber of commerce, the Chinese ratepayers' association, and the authorities of the two concessions, it was agreed that flags would be hung on eight designated days each year, and the issue was resolved. The day before yesterday (May 5th) was the anniversary of the Premier's inauguration as Extraordinary President and the establishment of the revolutionary government, and it was also the first anniversary of flag hanging after the establishment of the above-mentioned informal agreement. Going out early in the morning, one could see the national flag flying everywhere, solemn and beautiful. On the one hand, this demonstrated the citizens' patriotic enthusiasm, and on the other hand, it greatly inspired people.

It should be known that the national flag represents the country. We respect the country, and therefore we also respect the national flag. We cherish the country, and therefore we also cherish the national flag. We raise it very respectfully in the morning, and we should lower it very respectfully in the evening and store it properly. However, on the evening of the 5th, around 8:30, I went shopping and saw that many stores were still flying the national flag. Perhaps they were bearing the immense sorrow and indignation of being forced to take down the flag in the past, and wanted to fly it to their heart's content on days when they could hang it. However, out of respect for the national flag, we should take it down in the evening. In light of this, I specially borrow a corner of your esteemed publication to point out this error, hoping that all merchants in the city will pay attention to it. (Charity Sale Donation)

### Unfree Marriage

— (Buddha)

The marriage system for young people nowadays is free; there is no need for the orders of parents or the words of a matchmaker. However, old-fashioned families are an exception.

Now there is a certain young man who sees a certain modern woman and is pleased with her. They are deeply in love and always together. But when the woman wants to make a lifelong pledge and enter into marriage, the young man refuses, saying that as long as the old man next door is around, this agreement cannot be made. Listeners will definitely be surprised by this strange tale.

There have been cases of young people committing suicide because their marriage was interfered with by their parents and they could not achieve their goals. I have never heard of someone being afraid that the old man next door would interfere and therefore not daring to make an agreement. Mr. Zhang Shi is the first to have this happen.

### How to Revive Kunqu Opera

— Xing Shu

Hoping Mei Wan Hua will Call for Revival

Everyone knows that Kunqu opera is the essence of Chinese drama. It has elegant lyrics, melodious music, and delicate expressions. When Mei Lanfang performed "The Assassin of the Tiger" in the United States, it was quite successful, and those who perform Peking opera are also better if they have a Kunqu opera background! Thus, Kunqu opera should be very prosperous. However, the reality is not so. For example, the Xiani Society, which is the only surviving group, performed at the Dongfang Shuchang last year and at the Xianyao Theater recently, and the business was very bleak. The acting skills are no less than those of first-class Peking opera stars, and the ticket prices are very low, but the audience is never crowded. Compared with Shanghai Opera, Shaoxing Opera, and Changzhou Opera, it can be said that there is a world of difference. What is the reason for this?

Most people always say that Kunqu opera is "too highbrow" and "the words are too profound." This is certainly true, but I think this is not the main reason. For example, can the audience understand Peking opera? Probably not. I can sing a few lines, but honestly, apart from familiar plays, I'm just watching the performance. Moreover, in terms of dialogue, most of the dialogue in Kunqu opera is in Suzhou dialect. People in the Suzhou and Shanghai area should understand it more easily than Peking dialect. Why can't it attract attention? I think the following points are worthy of study.

Lack of Scenery

Watching a play is inseparable from watching the scenery. Facing beautiful and pleasing scenery is certainly more comfortable than facing a plain yellow board. I remember once going to see Zhou Xinfang's "The Magnificent缘," in which there was a Kunqu opera segment. The stage was decorated with extremely beautiful scenery, and the lights in the whole theater were dimmed, radiating beautiful arc lights. White snowflakes fell from above, and Wang Xichun, draped in a vermilion cloak, sang a Kunqu opera duet with Zhou Xinfang to the melodious sound of the flute. The whole theater was silent, and there was endless praise after the performance. If "The Peony Pavilion" had such a good scenery, I am afraid the effect would be the same.

Lack of Costumes

Costumes are quite important to ordinary people, let alone performing. If Mei Lanfang was asked to perform in a torn dress, it probably wouldn't be very good.

Lack of Publicity

Publicity is an indispensable thing. May I ask if anything in society can be a sensation without publicity? Which Peking opera stars were not made famous in Shanghai? The Xiani Society lacks publicity and support.

Lack of Comparison

As the saying goes, "You don't know the goods until you compare them." If you don't compare things, you won't see the difference. If the theater troupe 程剧团 has no other opera troupes to compare with, and they perform in Shanghai for five cents a year, people will probably think it is "commonplace and nothing to be surprised at." Now there is only one Xiani Society like this, and no matter how well they sing, there is no way to compare.

The above points of shortcomings, the way to save it, all lies in the economy. The members of the Xiani Society are all from poor backgrounds, and even their livelihood is a problem, let alone other things. As for re-establishing a Peking opera training class like those of the past, and teaching more new disciples, who would be willing to do this work? In the beginning, Mr. Mu Ouchu spent tens of thousands of dollars. It was not easy to train the current members of the Xiani Society, but now, those with the power to do so easily find it "incumbent" to do the complex work of Kunqu opera. In my opinion, only Mei Lanfang Mei can do it. He is now the king of Chinese drama. Shouldn't he promote the essence of Chinese drama? Is it not his duty to Zhang Chuanfang's skills, why can't he配断桥 for Wanhua? If we can get Wanhua to call for revival, then Kunqu opera will be revived one day.

Ms. Zhou Suixiu, a member of the Shanghai Bank Peking Opera Society, has a beautiful appearance, steady stage presence, and a clear voice. She is a talented female amateur.

### Watching the Abridged Version of "Tears on the Flowers"

— Victor

Lan Lan is much better than before, and all the sisters of the women's world are present

Adding the word "abridged" to "Tears on the Flowers" seems very ridiculous, but in fact, the Shanghai Drama Society is indeed performing an "abridged" version. Originally, "Tears on the Flowers" had five acts that could not be performed, and only the fourth act was performed. This Sunday morning, the Shanghai Drama Society performed at the XinGuang Experimental Theatre, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. In such a short two and a half hours, even performing four acts is impossible. Therefore, the Drama Society came up with an "abridged" performance: cutting off the beginning and end, and only leaving the middle section, cutting off the first act and only performing the middle second and third acts. Now let me talk a little about the performance.

This time, in these two acts, we found many corrections. Taking the actors alone, Lan Lan's Lai Lai is much better than in the past. When he recites poetry, his voice is also raised, and his eyes are on the poem; when listening to the truth, the earphones are also tightly attached to his ears, and his movements are much calmer. Especially in the third act, when she is preparing to sing La Salle's suicide, she uses many small movements to show Mimi's confused and painful mental state before her suicide, which is very good.

For example, the lights gradually dim, and the soft music rises. Mimi pours out all the cosmetics and lipsticks wrapped in her hand, and with a dazed and sad mood, stands in front of the mirror, looking at her still young and quite beautiful face and figure... Isn't it very lovely? When she first prepares to sing La Salle, a large handful of colored paper pieces from the Guidance Society suddenly falls outside, startling Mimi and causing her to ask loudly who it is? Isn't this much cuter than before? When she stands at the window and sheds tears sadly (this action is not done well enough), she takes the curtain and wipes her tears, and then (her face is gloomy) stretches out her hand from the window and slowly walks to the table to take the poured La Salle cup... Isn't this terrifying mood and atmosphere enough? In the past, Hong Mo played Chang Haicai, the comprador of the Dalai Bank, but Shuyan played it instead. His movements are more varied than Hong Mo's, but he has one shortcoming, which is that his shoulders and body shrug too much.

Mona's Mimi's mother is still a pleasing character, and the audience still likes her vulgar temper and laughs loudly, but the atmosphere of civilized drama is still strong.

Xia Xia, Zhang Wanjun, Xu Li, Tu Guang, and Ding Zhi all maintain their past achievements. There are two pieces of music inserted before and after the two acts, which adds a lot to the atmosphere of the play.

On the day of the performance, the dancers who are preparing to perform, such as Yang Wenying, Wei Chuyun, and Fang Lili, are all present. It is said that their play will not be performed until next month.

### Yifeng Drama Society Holds Registration

— Jing

The Yifeng Drama Society, led by the famous actor Zhou Xinfang, has been well-received since it performed at the Carlton Grand Theater and has won the trust of the audience, who consider it the only progressive and perfect troupe in Shanghai. Now, in order to make the organization more consolidated and sound, the company is preparing to register with the government, opening up a precedent for Peking opera troupes. Xinfang recently told people that Yifeng Society's performance is in a stage of 青黄不接, so the script must be both new and old, so as not to go against the evolution of the times and cater to the tastes of the audience. Only at the appropriate time can a comprehensive reform be carried out, so as to avoid the danger of wanting to achieve success too quickly. Xinfang's arduous management can be seen in this one aspect. Those who care about the future destiny of Peking opera should support and supervise it.

### Photo of Liu Qinxin's "Little Shepherd Boy"

— Xing Yan

In recent days, there has been a great flourishing of talents in 花衫. Among male actors, there are only a few such as Xiao Cuihua, Mao Shilai, and Xiao Guihua. Among female actors, there are not many in the north, and only Yu Sulian in Shanghai has been working hard to study recently. In addition, there is also a Liu Qinxin, a disciple of Liu Yuqin, who has a good foundation in 花旦戏 and whose skills in 蹻工 are steady, which is especially commendable. Green 花旦戏 mostly wear袄裤, and it is not enough to display the graceful posture and the beauty of a graceful figure without 蹂跷. For example, in the play "Little Shepherd Boy," there are many poses that are not easy to look good without踩跷. In their later years, famous Dan actors often vigorously advocated the abolition of this because they were not good at 蹻工. This is inevitably giving rise to ridicule that one would cut one's feet to fit the shoes.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Recording the Brutal Acts of Warlords Massacring Actors

The previous narration of the reasons for the rise in the value of actors is mostly due to the enthusiastic support of warlords and politicians before the Northern Expedition; but among them, there were also a few military men who hated the actors the most. One was Meng Enyuan, who had been the military governor of Jilin, and the other was Chu Yupu, who had been the military governor of Zhili. Meng once buried alive the Qinqiang opera star Yuan Yuanhong (named Wei Lian, not the old Yuan Yuanhong Guo Binchen). Chu once shot the male 生 San Kui, Liu Hanchen (not the Wusheng Liu Hanchen who is currently performing at the Tianchan Stage. This Liu Hanchen, whose original name was Eight Years Old Red. The deceased Liu Hanchen performed at the Nine Mu Di New Stage in his childhood, singing and learning from Pan Yueqiao, and it is said that he was Pan's adopted son, and Liu Wenkui was a brother of Liu Wenmei). The origin of these two incidents was all due to adultery and had a great relationship with their concubines. Meng was born from a 捞毛 (meaning pimp), so when it was his birthday one year, someone sent him a brocade, but when he opened it, it was a large teapot made of coarse porcelain, and on it was written the six characters "Large Teapot Meng Enyuan." At that time, there were many guests present, which really made him angry. It is said that his concubine was also born as a prostitute, and later fell in love with Yuan Yuanhong. Meng learned of this and captured Yuan Yuanhong and buried him alive. Who was the one who found the other to start their love affair? Because it was far away in the northeast and more than twenty years have passed, the people of society have not been able to find out the truth. As for the matter of Chu Yupu shooting the two actors Liu and Gao, it has only been a dozen years, and this matter is also close to Tianjin, where both Chinese and foreigners are concerned. Although Chu has passed away, the heroine who seduced Liu and Gao is still alive in the world. Therefore, I have long learned in detail the whole story of this incident, and now I will describe it in detail, first to speak out for the wronged actors, and second to expose the cruelty and killing of ordinary military men in the era of warlords, who insisted on their own way. It is just as the saying goes, "Loving someone, you want them to live; hating someone, you want them to die." They also supported the actors and killed them. This kind of nonsense behavior is incomparable to the patriotic generals led by Chiang Kai-shek today, who are loyal to the party and the country and defend the country with their hot blood. They have all received advanced training and only know to put national affairs first. Their virtuousness and unworthiness cannot be measured. 六)
