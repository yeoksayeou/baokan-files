### The Northeast Guerrilla Force Gains Momentum; Two Hundred Thousand People Are Organized into Ten Armies Under the Jurisdiction of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Association

(Chongqing) According to authoritative sources speaking to the Associated Press, the Japanese 18th Division, along with large numbers of Mongolian and "Manchukuo" troops, are currently engaged in a "campaign to wipe out Chinese guerrilla forces" in North China, fiercely fighting with approximately five hundred thousand Chinese guerrilla fighters. In order to deal with this situation, the Chinese guerrilla forces are currently busy organizing and recruiting guerrilla forces from the forests and deep mountains of Manchuria. To date, they have gathered two hundred thousand people, organized into ten "armies." Most of these guerrilla forces are Manchurian people who joined the volunteer army and fought against the Japanese army since the Mukden Incident in 1931. They were later dispersed by the Japanese army and are now being reorganized into an army to carry out guerrilla warfare in their homeland. These newly organized guerrilla forces are under the jurisdiction of the "Northeast Anti-Japanese Association," which is under the control of Chongqing. The reorganization of the Chinese guerrilla forces in the Northeast is the result of a government decision to restore China's legitimate administrative power in the Northeast. The location of the headquarters of the Chinese guerrilla forces in the Northeast is a military secret and will not be disclosed. (Dispatch from the 10th, Associated Press)

Editorial

### Re-Examining the Question of Amending the Neutrality Act

At the beginning of this year, when the 76th US Congress reconvened, President Roosevelt sent a message to Congress advocating for the amendment of the existing Neutrality Act. The editorial of this newspaper on January 7 pointed out that the existing Neutrality Act is not only insufficient to protect the United States from being drawn into the vortex of war, but also passively contributes to the atrocities of aggressors, causing her own legitimate interests to be repeatedly violated. If the United States wants to maintain its legitimate interests, it can only actively adopt effective sanctions against aggressors. President Roosevelt's request to amend the Neutrality Act is a preliminary step in sanctioning aggressors. Therefore, we hope that the isolationists in the US Congress can realize their previous mistakes and amend the indiscriminate Neutrality Act that they created, in order to stop the atrocities of the aggressors. Unfortunately, at that time, the isolationists in the Senate were still infatuated with outdated and backward concepts and postponed the issue again.

The isolationists in the United States still believe that the United States can be separated from Europe, Africa, and the Far East by the floods of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Despite the war clouds spreading there, the United States can always avoid being drawn into the vortex, so the current Neutrality Act does not need to be amended. When the views of these isolationists prevailed, the aggressors knew that as long as they did not directly infringe on the United States, the United States would not take any action other than verbally supporting the maintenance of peace. As a result, they became even more unscrupulous and engaged in more aggressive aggression. After Britain and France recognized Franco's regime in Spain, Italy actively promoted anti-French propaganda, increased troops in North Africa, and prepared to make unreasonable demands on France. Germany also formulated a plan to pressure Britain and France, preparing to issue an ultimatum to Britain and France when Italy made demands on France, and even to seize the Netherlands and Switzerland by lightning means, forcing Britain and France to submit. On the other hand, taking advantage of the opportunity that Britain and France were busy in the Mediterranean and unable to take care of the Pacific, they instigated Japan to launch a southward policy, creating a "September 18th Incident" in the Pacific, threatening the interests of the United States in the Pacific. This is the result of the isolationists' insistence on implementing the current Neutrality Act.

Recently, the issue of amending the Neutrality Act has once again become a central issue in the US Congress. Originally, the effective period of the "cash and carry" clause in the current Neutrality Act will expire on May 1, so it has to be discussed again. The so-called "cash and carry" means that third countries must trade with the United States in "cash" and transport the military supplies themselves. This provision treats aggressor and victim countries equally. Therefore, the implementation of this bill in fact completely facilitates the aggressor countries. The production of military supplies in aggressor countries must be greater than that of the victim countries. If the victim countries want to resist the aggressors, they must purchase a large number of military supplies from third countries, but the economic status of the victim countries is mostly relatively backward. Therefore, under the "cash and carry" provisions, it is difficult to obtain a large supply of munitions. Secondly, the military equipment of the aggressor countries is also more complete. After purchasing military supplies, they have their own merchant ships to load and a strong navy to protect transportation, while the victim countries have neither merchant ships nor warships. Therefore, after the implementation of this Neutrality Act, the aggressors are not unable to buy military supplies in the United States because of this, but the victim countries are instead blockaded. It is no wonder that President Roosevelt shouted loudly that the current Neutrality Act not only does not help peace, but also promotes war.

According to a Havas dispatch from Washington on the 9th, if the US Congress can expand the scope of implementation of "cash and carry," then the two naval powers of Britain and France will be able to control maritime transportation and have sufficient financial resources to pay for goods in cash, and will be able to obtain various necessities from the United States, which will be more advantageous than the totalitarian countries. If the US Congress really passes and implements this method, then it can be an ally of Britain and France in Europe, but it will inevitably be an ally of Japan in Asia. We believe that far-sighted members of Congress who are committed to world peace will never agree to this approach. We hope that Congress will pass the suggestion of Representative Thomas: authorizing the President and Congress to determine any country that violates international treaties signed by the United States as an aggressor country, and at the same time provide military supplies to the victim. This is the only way to effectively stop the atrocities of the aggressors, maintain world peace, and protect the legitimate interests of the United States.

### National Education Conference Declaration: Embracing the Guidance of the Supreme Leader and Creating a New Force for a Modern Nation

(Chongqing) (Continued from yesterday) At this education conference, Chairman Chiang personally presided over the meeting and interacted with sincerity. The members deeply admire and appreciate this spirit. We believe that the national education cause will surely achieve unified steps in will and universal improvement through mutual cooperation. The future of our education cause is infinitely bright. We in the education community pay our highest respect to our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang. His great spirit of leading the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction with unwavering determination has long been admired by our national education community. We are honored to receive his personal instructions this time. What he told us is not only far-sighted, but he also revealed to us "that the Three Principles of the People, which are based on revolution and saving the country, should be the highest standard of education in our country, to implement the program of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and to create a new life for a modern nation. The new life force of a modern nation is composed of three elements: education, economy, and military force. Education is the foundation of all undertakings." He further revealed to us, "We must create a modern country that has vitality and a promising future for China from all kinds of hardships and difficulties." We unanimously and sincerely use the guidance of the supreme national leader and the enlightenment of the supreme leader to encourage our colleagues in the national education community. We must have a strong will, and our education community must fulfill its responsibility to save the country and build the nation. Indeed, we still need to intensify our efforts, but we absolutely oppose the saying of some people that education has gone bankrupt, and we cannot admit the training that casually negates the value of education. We have been fighting in the War of Resistance for more than twenty months, and we are getting stronger as we fight. We do not know how much of this is due to the education we have received in the past thirty years. Since the War of Resistance, the national consciousness of the whole country has been universally promoted, and the heroic bravery of the soldiers at the front, especially the young officers, who have shed blood in the war, is a manifestation of the power of education. From now on, in order to win the victory of the War of Resistance and achieve the success of national reconstruction, and to increase the efficiency of education, our education community urgently needs to redouble its efforts. Chairman Chiang often says, "We should treat peacetime as wartime, and wartime as peacetime." He also said, "We must not forget the basics for the sake of emergency." These are truly wise words. Only by treating wartime as peacetime can we move forward calmly and persevere. Only by treating peacetime as wartime can we engage in our work with tension and take the initiative. We cannot forget that we not only want to resist the war, but also want to build the country. We must review our past shortcomings and strive to improve in order to comfort our own conscience. Our previous education has had many undeniable shortcomings in knowledge. We must train young people to be national educators, and we must have well-rounded and healthy intellectuals who are also healthy national teachers. Training young people must be given equal importance to training the masses. Training young people to establish themselves and be human is fundamental, and young people should be familiar with the history and geography of their country in order to inspire national concepts. However, the difficulties and pains of the future may be a hundred times greater than today. All our colleagues in the national education community must further recognize their extraordinary responsibility in the country, their hardship, and their example in order to set an example, change the atmosphere, rectify discipline, sacrifice generously, save honestly, and fight together for life and death. Furthermore, with healthy citizens, there must be a common faith to achieve unity of talent, and the people will be of one mind, and the strength will not be wasted. The Three Principles of the People has become the creed of the whole people, uniting the nation and consolidating the country. There is only this way. We hope that our colleagues in the national education community will take the realization of the Three Principles of the People as their own responsibility, deeply study it, and make it a common belief in general knowledge and a common political consciousness of the people, which are indispensable conditions for a modern unified country. For several years, because young people lacked a common political consciousness, the country did not know how many sacrifices it had gone through. The whole country has a unified consciousness of upholding the Three Principles of the People, which is the beginning of national rejuvenation. Colleagues in the education community should have a unified and sincere belief in this and use it to train young people. This is not only a passive way to avoid future disasters for the country, but also a proactive way to lead the nation to independence, equality, wealth, strength, and happiness. The supreme leader has shown us that education cannot be separated from politics, and the education community cannot abandon the country and society and not ask about it. We respect this meaning and are willing to embrace the common belief in the Three Principles of the People to train the spirit of the whole people in our country. (9th dispatch)

### Japanese Troops Captured Northwest of Zhao County

(Luoyang) Panxi Ferry, northwest of Zhao County, Hebei Province, is stationed with Japanese troops and the Second Regiment of the puppet army led by Liu Zhugong. Hua's troops learned that the Japanese and puppet troops were not well-defended, so they took the opportunity to surround and attack them on the 5th. In addition to killing more than a hundred people on the spot, the remaining three hundred Japanese and puppet troops were all captured. Hua's troops won a complete victory. Among the captured Japanese troops, there was also a Japanese commander. In addition, more than ten light machine guns, more than three hundred rifles and carbines, and many other military supplies were seized. (10th dispatch)

### Situation in Funing Unclear

(Tianjin) According to Japanese sources here, Funing in northern Jiangsu is said to have fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. It is also said that the Japanese troops who entered Funing came from the southeast corner of Haizhou. It is now said that the recent military goal of the Japanese army is to advance towards Huaiyin and Siyang. However, the Chinese army in the area has strong defenses and is sufficient to inflict a major blow on the Japanese army. (Fast News Agency dispatch, 10th)

### Tianjin-Hankou American Chamber of Commerce Demands Sanctions Against Japan, British Ambassador Negotiates with Japanese Foreign Ministry, Puppet Currency in North China Unable to Circulate in Various Regions

(Washington) According to the U.S. Department of Commerce today, the American Chamber of Commerce in North China has asked the U.S. government to take further action to protect American interests in Japanese-occupied areas. According to American businessmen in North China, the North China exchange and trade control measures to be implemented by the Japanese tomorrow are aimed at excluding American commerce in North China. The Japanese are using their puppets to implement restrictions on exports and exchange controls, apparently to deprive American industries of the Chinese raw materials they need, while at the same time preventing American goods from entering the North China market. Moreover, judging from the accumulated actions of the Japanese in North China, the Japanese purpose is clearly to drive out American commerce in North China. The American Chamber of Commerce in Hankou also expressed great dissatisfaction with the Japanese infringement of American rights and interests in China, especially the Japanese restrictions on foreign ships and the movement of foreign nationals in the Yangtze River. The passes presented by American nationals in Hankou are often not recognized by the Japanese. Nationals of any third country must obtain a pass from the Japanese. At the same time, according to a report from the American Chamber of Commerce in Hankou, in the one month since the Japanese army occupied Hankou, as many as three thousand Japanese ships have arrived in Hankou. American and other foreign businesses have been subjected to various difficulties by the Japanese, but Japanese goods can be freely sold in Hankou. At the same time, the Japanese are also freely transporting Chinese products to Japan. Finally, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hankou also asked the U.S. government to take strong retaliatory measures against Japan. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)

(Chongqing) The newspapers here have praised the proposal of foreign businessmen in Tianjin asking their national governments to take retaliatory actions against Japan's control of trade in North China. The newspapers all stated that the interests of Britain and the United States and Japan are completely in contradictory conflict, and there is no possibility of reconciliation. Therefore, they expressed surprise that Britain and the United States have not yet taken retaliatory measures. As for the trade control and exchange control currently implemented by Japan in North China, the purpose is clearly to intensify its economic war against Britain, the United States, and other countries. Therefore, if Britain and the United States want to protect their interests in China, in addition to providing more economic assistance to China, they must also take retaliatory actions against Japan. The Chinese Army's organ newspaper, *Sweeping Away*, published an article today praising the letter from former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson to the *New York Times*. The newspaper stated that although Stimson is a Republican leader, he not only fully supported President Roosevelt's advocacy of cooperation with Britain and France to confront the dictatorial countries, but also went on to advocate that the United States should seek naval cooperation with Britain and France once they were attacked. This spirit of discussing matters on their merits, without bias, is due to Stimson's far-sighted vision and broad mind. At the same time, it is also because Stimson has a full understanding of the indivisibility of peace. In short, Stimson's remarks can be said to be a head-on blow to the American isolationists. (Associated Press dispatch, 9th)

(Beiping) The plan to abolish legal tender in the entire North China region from the 11th of this month has been temporarily changed. According to the "Provisional Government" announcement today, from March 11th, North China will be divided into two regions in terms of currency circulation, namely the "United Reserve Zone" and the "Bandit Zone." The so-called "United Reserve Zone" is limited to eleven cities in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places are not included. People in this area will be punished if they are found carrying legal tender after March 11th, and their property will be confiscated. The order also stated that the circulation of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes will be promoted to other places as the Japanese army expands its occupation. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

(London) Although there is no official confirmation of the news that Beiping, Tianjin, and other places are not included in the North China "new currency" zone, it coincides with what the London financial community expected. It is said that Japanese businessmen also do not think the original plan is correct. Political and financial figures believe that Japan does not intend to make Anglo-Japanese relations excessively worse. Therefore, the recent order is actually a face-saving measure, not including the truly important central points in the order, but instead applying the order to other places that are not very important. At the same time, the impact of the Sino-British Exchange Stabilization Fund on Chinese currency prices is now attracting attention. *Financial News* said that the exchange rate of legal tender will be around eight and a half pence, while others believe it can reach nine pence. According to Reuters, the actual price of the exchange stabilization has not yet been determined. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

(Hong Kong) The Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee will be established in Hong Kong. The committee will have five members. HSBC and Mercantile Bank of England, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, each from China, will send one person. The other person will be a British person recommended by the Chinese government and confirmed by the British government. From now on, China's economic and financial policies will adopt the value of stabilizing the exchange rate of legal tender against the British pound. The purchase of foreign exchange must be traded with one of the banks of the management committee. (Special dispatch, 10th)

(London) The *Financial Times* editorial said that the announcement of the establishment of a Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund loan in the British Parliament on Wednesday, and the development of the Japanese currency plan in North China came one after another, the coincidence of which is very noteworthy. This loan is undoubtedly beneficial to commerce, but what is expected of British taxpayers and the officialdom is not only to stop at guaranteeing finances. Britain's policy in this regard has also greatly developed, as can be proved by the expansion of export credit loans. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

(London) In the British House of Commons today, a member asked Under-Secretary Butler whether he knew that British commerce in Yantai and Weihaiwei was completely paralyzed because the Japanese did not allow the export of goods that were not purchased with bills of exchange from the Yokohama Specie Bank. Butler replied that he was aware of this. Foreign Secretary Halifax is currently discussing the entire issue of trade and exchange control laws in North China ports with the British ambassador to Japan, Craigie. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

### Britain Helps China's Finances, Japan Has No Choice, Domestic Currency Once Tended to Inflate, Still Hopes Britain Will Change Its Policy

(Tokyo) Japanese Minister of Finance Taro Ishiwatari declared in the Lower House Budget Committee yesterday afternoon that Japan has inevitably experienced currency inflation to a certain extent, but this matter is not worth worrying about. Political figures interpreted this statement as meaning that as a result of the war against China, the purchasing power of the Japanese yen has been reduced. The Tokyo government is now actively using restrictive methods to prevent the devaluation of the currency. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)

(Tokyo) A Foreign Ministry spokesman criticized Britain's financial loan to China at a reception for foreign correspondents today, saying that it was not worthy of serious attention. If the British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon stated that the stability of the Chinese currency system is an element in Britain's economic policy towards China, which can greatly help British businessmen in China, then the British government should grasp the general trend of the East Asia incident by various methods and abandon its policy of assisting Chinese legal tender and assisting the new currency to promote its stability, then it will be seen that the old currency will be converted to the new currency without any difficulty. It is hoped that British politicians with a broad vision will soon realize the mistakes of their policy. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

(Tokyo) *Asahi Shimbun* reported that after British Ambassador to Japan Craigie explained Britain's new loan to China to Foreign Minister Arita yesterday, the Japanese Foreign Ministry immediately convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures and decided that it was necessary to warn Britain. It was also decided to carefully study the Japanese reaction. The newspaper continued, "We can say that Britain's attempt to maintain Chinese legal tender has inadvertently joined China's economic guerrilla warfare. Japan may not be without ways to counter it, such as delaying the solution to the Yangtze River navigation issue." Japanese newspapers all carried criticisms authorized by the authorities, and most of them strongly attacked this new currency loan. *Hochi Shimbun* also stated that the Japanese cabinet convened an emergency meeting in the Diet building on Thursday evening to discuss the government's attitude towards this new loan. It was heard that the cabinet had decided to issue a strong protest against this unfriendly act and adopt active countermeasures to resist the new Sino-British agreement. If Britain continues this unfriendly action, Japan should take retaliatory action against British interests in China. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)

(Tokyo) Britain's lending of huge sums of money to China has aroused extreme indignation throughout Japan. Political figures are speculating whether the Japanese government will lodge a protest with London. According to a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman this morning, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Craigie has formally notified Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Sawada of the nature and certain details of this loan, stating that Britain had no choice but to lend money to China in order to protect its interests in China and maintain the stability of the Chinese currency. Sawada immediately protested on behalf of the Japanese government. According to the spokesman, Britain's attitude completely disregards the recent developments in the Far East and is intent on maintaining the status quo. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)

(London) After Japanese Foreign Minister Arita issued a statement in the Japanese House of Representatives on the 6th of this month (the content of which roughly stated that the "China Incident" was launched by the Communist International, and although Japan is dealing with the Communist International with all its strength, it is not an omnipotent country and does not need to adopt a hostile attitude towards the United States, Britain and France), the *Times* of London correspondent in Tokyo recently sent a telegram to explain it, saying, "This statement implicitly indicates that although Japan has joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, it will not endanger Japan's relationship with the United States, Britain and France because of the other signatory countries, namely Germany and Italy. Because although this pact can facilitate Japanese policy at certain points, at other points, it must obtain the approval of the democratic countries, or at least their understanding, before it can achieve anything. Based on this, since Japan has not unconditionally joined the anti-democratic bloc, plans for further and closer cooperation between the signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact will be rejected by the Japanese authorities no matter where they come from." (Havas dispatch, 10th)

(London) After Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon announced in the House of Commons yesterday that he would lend the remaining funds to China, the *Yorkshire Post* (formerly known as the organ of former Foreign Secretary Eden) recently commented, "The British government's decision to help China establish a £10 million exchange stabilization fund is tantamount to a head-on blow to Japan. These negotiations have been going on for some time, and the intention is less to deal with Japan and more to strengthen China's financial foundation to develop trade between China and Britain. Since the Chinese authorities cannot control legal tender, their trade will be adversely affected. The British government has previously granted China credit loans (totaling £500,000), and now it has helped establish an exchange stabilization fund. From then on, Britain's policy of protecting and developing its trade with China will always be effectively promoted." The *Manchester Guardian* stated, "This financial loan has been criticized by Japan as a political move. We will not discuss it for the time being, but it is a real situation that this move has significant meaning and will have far-reaching effects. In short, the financial loan is enough to maintain China's economic health, so Japan cannot have this major condition to subdue China. Based on this, it is undeniable that the influence that this move can cause has a political nature. In the UK's view, this is an unavoidable duty. If the British authorities are afraid that these political influences will be unfavorable to the country because Japan is suspicious, they will be afraid and not help China's finances with concrete methods, that is, the UK will abandon its responsibility to protect its trade with China in order to be wary of Japan's suspicions, that is certainly not the reason."

### Observations from London: The European Situation Has Improved; Italy Will Not Be Overly Demanding of France; Disarmament Will Be Revisited

(London) Responsible figures here recently stated that the international situation has improved in the past two months. Once the Spanish Civil War ends and the Franco-Italian dispute is peacefully resolved, all involved nations can further discuss the issue of arms limitation. It is reported that when Prime Minister Chamberlain approached Italy in January of this year, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini stated that as long as the Spanish problem and the Franco-Italian dispute remained unresolved, the international situation could not be stabilized. Now that the Spanish Civil War is nearing its end, and the Franco-Italian dispute is likely to be resolved peacefully, the various demands put forward by Italian newspapers and irresponsible individuals should not be given undue weight. In general, the main issues to be discussed when France and Italy negotiate in the future will be the following three: (1) the issue of French Somaliland's Djibouti port; (2) the issue of the Djibouti port railway to Addis Ababa; (3) the issue of the legal status of Italian nationals in French Tunisia in North Africa. Although there is currently no information on the content of the demands that the Italian government plans to make, it is expected that the country will make many demands to create room for bargaining, and it can be asserted that a compromise solution will eventually be found. Once the Spanish problem and the Franco-Italian dispute are resolved successively, all nations can negotiate on the issue of arms limitation. Even if only a small-scale arms reduction agreement can be reached, it will be of great benefit to restoring confidence and boosting world trade. As for the articles still appearing in German newspapers criticizing democratic nations, and the aggressive remarks made by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels at the Leipzig city market recently, their purpose is only for domestic propaganda and should not be given too much weight. The claim that many key German figures have anti-British sentiments is also considered an exaggeration. For example, although Labor Front leader Robert Ley is a radical figure in the National Socialist Party, he also sincerely expressed sympathy and goodwill towards Britain during his meeting with Prime Minister Chamberlain. In addition, Overseas Trade Minister Hudson will soon go to Berlin to conduct economic negotiations with German government officials. This trip is also of great importance, and based on the recent informal contacts between Britain and Germany, the prospects for economic negotiations are optimistic. This is another factor in easing the situation. (Havas News Agency, 9th)

(Berlin) British officials recently made statements that the international situation has improved in the past two months and that the future is relatively optimistic. German political figures, upon hearing this, offered commentary, expressing doubt, and stating, "As long as the spiritual disarmament of totalitarian nations by Britain and the United States is not achieved," there is no need to talk about arms reduction. The urgent priority is that Britain and the United States should first advise the Soviet Union to reduce its armaments. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

(Berlin) The French newspaper "L'Ere Nouvelle" reported yesterday that Führer Hitler plans to seize the Netherlands and Switzerland within this year by surprise means, thereby coercing the democratic nations of Western Europe into submission. Semi-official circles here recently denied this, saying, "This is nonsense, not worth laughing at." (Havas News Agency, 10th)

### British Foreign Secretary Announces Policy on Spain: Does Not Recognize Nationalists' Blockade But Trusts Their Guarantee of Independence

(London) The House of Lords discussed the Spanish issue this afternoon. After the members spoke, Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax explained the government's position, which included two points: (1) Regarding the Spanish Nationalist government's plan to blockade the coast controlled by the Republican government, the British government has instructed its warships that whenever they encounter submarines attempting to sink British ships, they should retaliate, even within Spanish territorial waters. (2) Expressing trust in the guarantee provided by the Spanish Nationalist government authorities to maintain the territorial integrity of the country, while also stating that if this guarantee cannot be kept, an extremely serious situation will develop as a result. The following is a summary of Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech. The Foreign Secretary first stated that after the Spanish Nationalist government decided to blockade the coast controlled by the Republican government, the British Admiralty had already notified British ships that "the government believes that the Nationalist authorities have no intention of taking any action outside territorial waters, but I must make it clear that if the Nationalists take any action outside territorial waters, the British government will have no choice but to take appropriate measures, following past practice, to retaliate. If any submarine attacks a British ship without issuing a warning or ensuring the safety of the crew in an appropriate manner, the British government will consider it a most serious event and has instructed its warships to take the necessary measures to protect British ships and retaliate against such submarines, even within Spanish territorial waters. As for the general situation in Spain, maintaining the territorial integrity of the country is extremely important to the British government. Regarding this matter, the Nationalist government has repeatedly provided guarantees. Some may fear that this guarantee may not be worth anything, but the British government believes that this guarantee has been accepted in good faith, and others must also keep it in good faith. If not, an extremely serious situation will ensue. It can be asserted that regarding the request for the Nationalist government to issue an amnesty decree, some advocate that the British government should do its best for the Republican government authorities. It should be known that the British government is exchanging views with the Nationalist authorities, and there is a possibility of reaching a peaceful solution. If Britain openly sides with the Madrid government, it will only spoil things. If the Nationalist government and the Republican government can reach an agreement in the future, the British government will do its best to help implement it. This has been mentioned repeatedly, and I emphasize it again." (Havas News Agency, 9th)

(London) The House of Lords discussed the Spanish issue this afternoon. First, opposition Labor Party member Lord Snell proposed a motion, stating that since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the British government's policies have failed and national interests have been greatly damaged. Now, all attention should be focused on the situation in Spain to ensure that the promise of maintaining territorial integrity can be realized. As for the relief of refugees and the safety of Republican government personnel, these are secondary matters. He then gave a speech, stating that the government had pressured France to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government and had allowed Spanish Republican government personnel to be disposed of by General Franco, which was inappropriate. "Now there is a person who has brazenly betrayed his own government, how can it be guaranteed that he will not betray our country?" Former Air Minister Lord Swinton then spoke, expressing his support for the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government, and stated that the Soviet Union was the first to interfere in the Spanish Civil War. Lord Cecil stated that the non-intervention policy was a shameful farce. Finally, Foreign Secretary Halifax delivered an important speech, ending the debate. (Havas News Agency, 9th)

### Madrid: All Communists Surrender; 1,400 Captured, Nationalists Say They Will Attack

Madrid: An official communiqué recently announced that the Communist headquarters has surrendered and that a total of 1,400 party members have been captured.

(Paris) News has just arrived from Madrid, stating that the Communist headquarters surrendered to Prime Minister Miaja this evening. Earlier, Mr. Walter Garcia volunteered to mediate, but to no avail. Until 8:00 a.m. this morning, government forces resumed their attack. For a time, the sound of cannons boomed, mixed with the sound of machine guns. The intensity subsided slightly until noon. The central district of the city was extremely chaotic. Soon, the government dispatched fresh troops to suppress the Communists, who finally succumbed. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

Burgos: According to news received here, the Communists in Madrid, Valencia, and other cities are now clearly determined to overthrow the Defense Committee. It is reported that the Defense Committee is dominant in all cities. People here believe that the current chaos in Madrid can only be stopped by a large-scale Nationalist offensive. It appears that the date of the Nationalist offensive is not far off. (Reuters, 9th)

### Soviet Communist Party: Congress Opens Yesterday Afternoon

(Moscow) The 18th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party will open at 5:00 p.m. on March 10 in the Kremlin Palace. Representatives from all over are arriving here one after another, including party workers, commanders of the Red Army, Navy, and Air Force, political instructors, economic organization staff, scientists, Stakhanovite workers, and outstanding collective farmers. Stalin and the members of the Politburo have been elected as delegates to the Congress by the national party departments and the party congresses of the various ethnic republics. (TASS, 9th)

(Moscow) The 18th National Congress of the Soviet Communist Party is scheduled to open today in the Kremlin Palace. Approximately 2,000 delegates, elected by 2 million members of the National Communist Party, will attend. It is noted that the previous Congress was held five years ago, after which the anti-Party elements were purged. Only now is this Congress being convened. There are many proposals to be discussed, the most important of which include: (1) Large-scale denunciations should be condemned; (2) Party members should have the right to criticize and the right to appoint lawyers in court for defense; (3) The conditions for joining the Party should be standardized. In other words, the current conditions for joining the Party, which are convenient for workers, should be extended to all citizens. Because lower-level officials who have not obtained Party membership and are well aware that joining the Party is very difficult and takes a long time are often dispirited, it is necessary to encourage them. Regarding this matter, the Soviet government authorities plan to reduce the conditions for joining the Party. All citizens need only accept the Party's principles without thoroughly studying them, and they will be allowed to obtain Party membership. Informed sources here commented that what the Soviet government is emphasizing now is to stimulate the people's patriotism and make them obey discipline, and no longer focuses on theoretical exploration. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

### US to Build Two Giant Warships: 45,000 Tons Each, Costing $200 Million

(Washington) Chief of Naval Operations Rear Admiral Leahy recently told the press that the Navy Department will begin constructing two battleships with a tonnage of 45,000 tons in the short term. Once the House Appropriations Committee discusses the 1939-40 fiscal year Navy budget (totaling $700,000,000) this month, it will be submitted for discussion. The cost of each ship will be approximately $100 million. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

(Paris) The European edition of the New York Herald Tribune recently carried a cable from New York, stating, "Informed sources in naval circles here say that the Navy Department is planning to build a 45,000-ton battleship, to be named the 'New York,' costing approximately $100 million, and will submit a bill to Congress." (Havas News Agency, 10th)

Middletown, Connecticut: Senator Nye, a Republican from North Dakota and one of the original proposers of the current Neutrality Act, recently gave a speech here, stating that if the United States joins an international collective security plan, it would be tantamount to suicide. The situation in Europe may evolve to a certain stage that would force the United States to participate in the European war for a second time. I am not unaware of this, but before deciding on the mode of participation, we must thoroughly understand the content of this situation in order to better safeguard American interests. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

Baltimore, Maryland: Senator Thomas, a Democrat from Utah and a member of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, recently gave a speech here, opposing the current Neutrality Act, saying, "This law is enough to prevent the United States from taking effective action in the world. President Roosevelt is also bound by it when a state of war exists, unable to adapt to circumstances and handle international events, and must be amended. For the present, Congress should pass a bill authorizing the President to include various raw materials in addition to munitions in the list of prohibited exports, and after obtaining the consent of Congress, prohibit any country that violates international treaties signed by the United States from purchasing munitions and various raw materials in the United States. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

### All-India Congress: Supports Gandhi

Tripuri: The All-India Congress People's Committee has passed a resolution of confidence in Gandhi and expressed regret for the defamation of the highest authorities of the Congress. Most of the highest authorities are disciples of Gandhi. Leftists believe that this move is a movement against Bose. (Reuters, 10th)

### US and Brazil: Conclude Financial Agreement, US Lends $50 Million to Brazil, Credit Loan of $9.2 Million

(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently concluded a financial agreement with Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha, the main points of which are as follows: (1) The United States lends Brazil $50,000,000 in gold to organize a central bank; (2) The US Export-Import Bank provides Brazil with a credit loan to promote bilateral trade, with interest limited to below 5%; (3) The Export-Import Bank provides an additional credit loan of $9,200,000 to the "Bank of Brazil" to maintain exchange rate freedom, to be repaid with principal and interest before June 24, 1941; (4) Brazil's foreign debt denominated in US dollars and with suspended principal and interest payments shall continue to be repaid with principal and interest from August 1 of this year. (Havas News Agency, 9th)

(Washington) The financial agreement concluded between the United States and Brazil is in the form of an exchange of notes, the main points of which are as follows: (1) The Brazilian government promises to take necessary measures on exchange rates to remit cash in order to pay for the value of US imports and the principal and interest of Brazilian bonds issued in US dollars. The principal and interest of these bonds were once suspended, and it is agreed that they will continue to be repaid from August 1 of this year. (2) Brazil shall organize a central bank so that the international pastoral situation can correspond to the regular financial resources held by foreign exchange, but Brazil must be given a credit loan by the United States before holding sufficient gold reserves. (3) The US government agrees to request Congress to approve the loan of gold to the Brazilian government for application under fair conditions, the amount of which is limited to $50,000,000, and when necessary, it can be used as a supplementary gold reserve. Brazil will repay the principal and interest with its gold production. In addition, the United States will send several consultants to assist Brazil in organizing a central bank. Regarding the loan, Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, stating that Brazil currently has 30 tons of gold, valued at $35,000,000, and produces approximately 8 tons of gold annually. The total of both can hold 70 tons of gold after five years, valued at $80,000,000, which is approximately 32% of the total amount of banknotes currently issued in the country. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

(Washington) After the financial agreement between Brazil and the United States was concluded, Undersecretary of State Welles gave a statement to the press, expressing his happiness, saying, "If this agreement can be used well, the trade relationship between Brazil and the United States can have a significant and positive impact." Responsible officials in the United States also stated that the totalitarian nations would conclude barter agreements with Brazil and add certain interests to realize their economic aggression attempts. Now that the Ba-Mei financial agreement has been concluded, the crisis of economic aggression that offsets it can also be eliminated. In the future, the United States and Brazil can also exchange US wheat for Brazilian manganese in the same way as this agreement. As for Brazil's US dollar-denominated foreign debt, the agreement to continue repaying principal and interest can also be satisfied. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

### Another Internal Change in Czechoslovakia: Slovakia Demands Independence, Key Figures Arrested, Government Reorganized

Czech Capital: A large-scale disturbance has occurred in Slovakia. The central government army has surrounded the public institutions of the province's capital and has declared martial law. Slovak Prime Minister Dr. Tiso has retired to a Jesuit monastery, and there are rumors that he has been arrested. (Associated Press, 10th)

(Berlin) According to news from Bratislava, the capital of the Slovak province of Czechoslovakia, the central military authorities have issued a martial law order in the province. After the provincial government was ordered to reorganize, thousands of members of the Slovak Autonomous Party gathered in front of the provincial government this morning, shouting, "We will never yield, we demand a free Slovakia!" The police department immediately sent personnel to suppress them. In addition, various Czech groups in the city have armed themselves and clashed with Slovak radicals this morning, but the Czechs have been able to control the situation. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

Czech Capital: President Hacha ordered the dissolution of the autonomous government of the Slovak province last night and dismissed Tiso, the prime minister and minister of the interior of the province, as well as Vanco, the minister of justice, Dzuganski, the minister of transportation, and Cernak, the minister of education, and appointed Sferak as prime minister and transferred former Minister of Industry Deplanski as minister of finance.

### UK's Current Air Force Budget: 12 Times Higher Than Any Previous Year, A Huge Sum of Over £220 Million, 1,750 First-Line Aircraft

(London) Air Minister Wood detailed the large-scale expansion of the air force in the House of Commons today to meet the defense needs of the British Empire, saying that the current figure is 12 times higher than any year from 1929 to 1934. Wood presented the air force budget, saying that this budget is approximately double the total defense budget for the sea, land, and air forces from 1932 to 1933. This year's air force budget has increased by £74,000,000, which is equal to the entire national defense budget in 1913. Around April 1 this year, there will be 1,750 first-line aircraft. Britain is spending £250,000 per day on aircraft manufacturing this year, and the cost will be even higher thereafter. The largest item in this year's air force budget is the cost of aircraft and anti-aircraft balloons, totaling £93,000,000. The local women's auxiliary corps is currently forming 35 detachments. Wood said that Britain is blocking balloon defenses, and this equipment in London can now be used when needed. He hopes that this equipment can be completed throughout the country by the end of this year. The civilian air defense team currently has more than 1,400 members, all of whom have obtained flight licenses. In addition, there are 3,800 people undergoing flight training. The standard for pilots is now higher than before. There are currently 30 squadrons of the Imperial Air Force stationed overseas, and 7 more squadrons will be formed to meet the goal of increasing overseas air force to 500 first-line aircraft. Britain has always regarded counter-attack as an important factor in its strategy and still attaches importance to its value. A powerful offensive force is not only a tool to prevent enemy attacks, but also a necessary component in enriching air defense. Recent developments have indeed reduced the advantage of attack and focused on sky defense, but this does not mean that we can rely solely on fighter jets and ground defenses to defend against the enemy. Eleven aircraft manufacturing plants established according to the concealment plan have now started construction, and aircraft production has also made great progress. Plants in a group of three or four will manufacture the same aircraft to avoid production interruption due to the shutdown of one plant. In this way, large-scale design and ordering can be facilitated, and the disruption caused by war can be reduced. Aircraft drawings will also be reduced to speed up production. Last November, he estimated that by the end of next year, British aircraft production could increase by 400% compared to the 1938 production. Today, he dares to hope that this goal can be achieved by the end of this year. Although today's air force budget is unprecedented, it is necessary. He firmly believes that this is the best way to prevent war and hopes that the world will realize this and change its course. Wood announced that the current air force budget is £220,626,700, which is unprecedented in the history of the British Air Force. It is noted that the British Air Force budget in 1934 was only around £18,000,000. Wood explained that the huge amount of this year's funding is mostly due to (1) the Air Force's adoption of a large number of new aircraft, (2) the expansion of aircraft manufacturing capacity, (3) the construction of new air stations, (4) the sudden increase in aircraft production, and (5) the unusually enthusiastic response from the people, resulting in the increase of air force personnel to 102,000. The large-scale delivery of fuselages and engines, the accelerated progress of the construction of air stations and aircraft factories, and the implementation of the balloon obstruction plan have all increased the air force budget. This not only indicates the success of Britain's efforts to expand its air force, but also shows that the British people have a full understanding of air defense and the determination to be fully prepared. Aircraft production has increased by 150% compared to last year. Aircraft purchased in the United States are now arriving in Britain one after another, and aircraft ordered in Canada will also begin delivery next year. A British air force delegation is currently in Australia to study the possibility of manufacturing aircraft. The number of workers employed in the British aircraft manufacturing industry has increased by 40% in the past six months. All new aircraft submitted for inspection are extremely qualified, indicating that Britain now has the best aircraft in the world. Last June, he asked the people to apply for pilots, scouts, etc., totaling 31,600 people. This number has already been exceeded last week. There are 1,400 applicants who are physically qualified. He will need 20,000 more people in the coming year. (Reuters, 9th)

### Britain, Australia, and New Zealand: To Discuss Strengthening Defense

(London) Informed sources here recently stated that the British government will hold a "Pacific Conference" in the Far East with representatives from the Commonwealth of Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand in the short term. The agenda includes (1) the sea, land, and air defense of the British Dominions in the Pacific, (2) the opening of civil aviation routes, and (3) the issue of army officer training. The British government's attendees will mainly be representatives from the sea, land, and air forces. Among them, General Squires, the representative of the War Office, and Rear Admiral Colvin, the representative of the Admiralty, have already arrived in the Commonwealth of Australia. Since the Dominion of Canada can supply aircraft manufactured by them to the Dominions in the Pacific in the future, just as they supply the British mainland, they may also send personnel to participate in the meeting at that time. (Havas News Agency, 10th)

(London) Aviation Minister Wood stated in the House of Commons today that Hong Kong is a part of the British Empire, and Britain hopes that an air force reserve team will be trained there, as well as in Malaya and East Africa. (Reuters, 9th)

### Last Year’s Purchases from England by China Reached Over £180,000; Committee Holds Annual Meeting

(London) The Chinese Government Purchasing Commission held its annual meeting this afternoon at the Chinese Embassy. Ambassador Guo Taiqi chaired the meeting, with Chinese Commissioner Wang Jingchun, British Commissioner Weiji Hood, and others in attendance. The atmosphere at the meeting was optimistic. Ambassador Guo congratulated the establishment of the national currency stabilization fund. Although the volume of purchases by the committee decreased significantly due to the war over the past year, it was reported that a total of 74 purchases were made, with a value of £182,034. Of particular interest was the order for £35,000 worth of telephone and telegraph equipment for the development of Southwest China. In the second half of the year, £30,000 worth of railway materials were purchased. The purchase of railway materials needed for the Yunnan-Burma Railway has now begun. Since the committee began purchasing materials in England in 1931, it has purchased a total of £5,266,783. The total operating expenses were £48,439, which translates to operating expenses of 18 shillings and 9 pence per £100 of purchases. The interest income is approximately four times greater than the operating expenses. At the end of the year, the committee had a total of £788,963 in fixed deposits and current accounts. In the past year, the committee has sent Chinese students to British machinery factories and shipyards for internships. (Reuter, 9th)

### Chinese Troops Counterattack Fuyang; Only Over a Hundred Residents Remain in the City

Fuyang Correspondence: Fuyang City was once recovered by General Liu Jianxu's troops of the Chinese army. Subsequently, a large unit of Japanese troops from Hangzhou reinforced the area, and the Chinese troops withdrew from Fuyang City and defended Zhongzhou, Zhujialing, and other positions. After the Japanese troops occupied Fuyang City, they sent their troops to harass the Yingzhen area. The houses in Fuyang City were reduced to ashes by a large fire. About 1,000 innocent civilians who did not have time to escape were arbitrarily killed and raped by the Japanese troops, and the roads were filled with corpses. Currently, apart from the Japanese troops and puppet officials, only over a hundred residents remain in the entire city, living in extreme misery. Recently, Chinese troops have advanced to Fusha, Zhoujiapu, Dayuanzhen, and the Japanese troops at Huozi Mountain have also been cleared by the Chinese army. The Chinese army's positions have added many air defense works, and County Magistrate Wang has convened various agencies to allocate civilian laborers to actively construct them. The county government's funds are also sufficient, and a joint office system is adopted, with all accounting personnel managed by Director Qin Wenjiang. Hu Jiaxiang was appointed by the provincial government as the director of the county treasury. All political work is proceeding as usual. It is rumored that the vanguard of the Chinese army has reached the suburbs of Fuyang City and is advancing towards the city. The Japanese troops in the city are retreating along the Hangzhou-Fuyang Road towards Yuhang.

### Zhang Shanzi's Works Open at Paris Exhibition

(Paris) The famous Chinese painter Zhang Shanzi came to France at the invitation of Bishop Yu Bin of the Nanjing Diocese to exhibit his works, in order to raise funds for the relief of refugees in the Chinese war zone. The exhibition opened at the Foreign Art Museum at 3:00 PM today. French Minister of Education Thiaut Johann, Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun, and Archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Verdier, represented the attendees and jointly presided over the opening ceremony. The appreciation of the works is truly rare in the Parisian art world this year. Mr. Zhang is a Catholic and has worked in the Chinese judicial system for many years. His painting style is different from that of ordinary modern Chinese painters. In essence, Mr. Zhang still adheres to the traditional spirit of Chinese painting, unlike other painters who focus on integrating Chinese and Western painting techniques. His painting "Lotus" was once exhibited here in 1933 and has now been purchased by the French government. Mr. Zhang has become particularly famous in recent years for painting tigers. He usually keeps several fierce tigers at home, carefully studies them, and then depicts them on paper, all with lifelike accuracy. His being admired by Parisians is well-deserved. After the end of the art exhibition here, Mr. Zhang will also cross over to America to hold an exhibition in New York. (Havas, 10th)

### Beiping Postal Chief Detained for Over a Month; Platt Returned Safely to Beiping; Ransom of 10,000 Yuan Fully Returned; Platt Praises Guerrilla Discipline

The "China Press" Beiping correspondent reports: The Beiping Postal Chief, Platt, was detained in the Western Hills for forty days, and suddenly returned to Beiping before the lunar New Year. Platt was arrested on January 8th while picnicking at the Ming Tombs with a friend. On the way to the Ming Tombs, they passed through a small town. The Japanese garrison soldiers there heard that Mr. Platt was going to the Ming Tombs and said that the area around the Ming Tombs was quite safe, but when they arrived and were dining, they were surrounded by armed Chinese, who called Mr. Platt a hateful Japanese who was plundering their country. They blindfolded Mr. Platt and quickly dragged him and his driver into the mountains. Mr. Platt's friend was sent back soon after. That night, Mr. Platt and several other Chinese prisoners were held in a small room. Soon, a man in civilian clothes entered the room to visit Mr. Platt. The man's surname was Liu (transliteration), and he seemed to have some authority. Mr. Platt explained to him that he was not Japanese but Italian. Mr. Liu angrily said that the Italians were also their enemies because they were helping Japan. Mr. Platt further explained that he was a postal worker who had been working for the Chinese government for over thirty years. Mr. Liu slowly said, "If that's the case, you must be a traitor. You were appointed by the National Government, but now you are working for the Japanese." This conversation at least prevented Mr. Platt from being killed as a hateful Japanese. Mr. Platt was then forced to write a note to a friend in Beiping, stating that if a ransom was delivered to a certain village, he would be freed. Mr. Platt's driver was immediately released and returned to Beiping with the note. However, after they directly delivered 10,000 yuan on Tuesday, Mr. Platt was still not released. These guerrillas changed locations every night on the mountain, either living in isolated farmhouses on the hillside or in herdsmen's huts, so the accommodations were very simple. But if possible, they would let Mr. Platt live in a room alone. On the mountain, the sky was already dark by 4:00 PM, and the weather was cold at night. The food was also very poor, only hard-to-swallow porridge and salted vegetables, but this was not because the guerrillas were treating Mr. Platt badly, but because they themselves often had difficulty obtaining supplies. They shared what they ate with the detainees. Once or twice, they treated Mr. Platt with skinny chicks, which he also received from the food sent from Beiping. The Chinese prisoners who were detained were arrested on the plains and accused of being traitors because they or their relatives were indeed working for the Japanese. Those who were proven to be directly traitors were shot. Those who were not directly traitors were released after strict guarantees and the payment of a ransom. The prisoners were interrogated by a special court, presided over by the aforementioned Mr. Liu. Messengers traveled back and forth between the various camps of these guerrillas day and night, so they seemed to have a lot of contact and cooperation with other guerrillas. The clothing of the guerrillas who detained Mr. Platt was quite inconsistent, but many of them wore Japanese army coats, military caps, and were equipped with Japanese army rifles, battlefield telescopes, and trench periscopes. They also maintained a small degree of military discipline, especially when on sentry duty. The sentries' on-duty time was determined by burning a stick of incense. Mr. Platt also heard gunshots not far away several times. On one occasion, the Japanese army came within about a mile, but during the forty days he spent with the guerrillas, he did not see them suffer any casualties. Mr. Platt believes that the people who captured him were not affiliated with the Eighth Route Army, because he did not hear them mention this name. What he heard was that they called themselves guerrillas. After Mr. Platt returned to Beiping, the local newspapers published it in a special and prominent position, and said that the guerrillas had mistreated local residents, but the reporter had met Mr. Platt, and he could not confirm this statement, because the guerrillas had never passed through or stayed in any villages. Furthermore, although the guerrillas lightly demanded food from the farmhouses on the mountain, they definitely paid for it, or would repay it later when they found food elsewhere, and they would repay any surplus. The mountain people also delivered messages for the guerrillas. Finally, the guerrillas suddenly told Mr. Platt that he was free and could leave at will, but Mr. Platt did not leave immediately, but waited for the guerrillas to escort him to Nankou. Before Mr. Platt set off, the guerrillas returned the 10,000 yuan ransom and the camera. When they arrived at Nankou, Mr. Platt said goodbye to the guerrillas and immediately hired a donkey and his loyal groom to rush back to Beiping. For three days on the way, they passed through guerrilla areas and Japanese army defense lines. Because he was carrying a large sum of money, he was afraid of encountering unexpected events again or being considered a spy by the Japanese army, so it was quite dangerous, but he avoided the main roads, highways, and military posts, and managed to return to a safe place. Mr. Platt replied to reporters' inquiries that he did not understand the reason for the return of the ransom. Some say that Wu Peifu intervened to prove his power to the Japanese side. If so, this matter should have been vigorously promoted, but it was kept strictly secret, and this statement was transmitted from a very suspicious source. Some say that the guerrillas acted on the direct orders of the Chinese government. Everyone here knows that the Beixiao Post Office and the Italian Association appealed to the Chinese government to release Mr. Platt several weeks ago, which can be used as supporting evidence for this view. Furthermore, about two weeks before Mr. Platt's release, several parties who had close contact with the Chinese government beforehand claimed that the Chinese government had ordered the release of Mr. Platt, which seems to be the most reasonable explanation.

### Feng Yuxiang Proposes Eliminating the Malpractices of Conscription; Ministry of Military Administration Issues Circular for Compliance

Ningbo Correspondence: The Ministry of Military Administration recently issued a circular to all division management areas, relaying it to the headquarters of all regimental management areas, stating: "Having received a telegram from Chairman Chiang of the Military Committee, stating that according to a letter from Feng Huanzhang, the malpractices of conscription have not yet been eliminated, and there are many instances of substitution and bribery, which greatly affects the implementation of military service. Many new recruits desert after enlisting, and cannot be recovered. In this situation, on the one hand, local authorities should be instructed to quickly improve the Baojia organization and military service administration, thoroughly investigate, seriously punish, improve the treatment of soldiers, and reduce the suffering of soldiers. On the other hand, efforts should be made to strengthen propaganda work, so that the people understand the importance of today's war of resistance and its relationship to themselves. It is hoped that these instructions will be followed." It is noted that in order to eliminate the malpractices of conscription, prevent desertion of new recruits, improve the treatment of soldiers, and strengthen propaganda work, the Ministry has previously promulgated the "Methods for Drawing Lots for National Conscription," "Methods for Preventing and Handling Desertions in Various Units," "Methods for Soldier Care," and "Outlines for Implementing Conscription During Wartime," etc., and has issued circulars for compliance. Now, in accordance with the aforementioned reasons, in addition to sending a separate letter to the Political Department, it is hoped that these instructions will be followed and relayed to subordinates for strict compliance.

### Japanese Troops Land at Qixu Port; Both Sides in Stalemate

Taixian Correspondence: At around 6:00 AM on the 27th of last month, over 200 Japanese troops landed at Qixu Port, which belongs to Taixing County, in small motorboats, with unclear intentions. Chinese troops are closely deployed in the Sixianzhen area, preparing to resist. Both sides are in a stalemate. As of the time the reporter was writing, there had been no contact. However, at 12:30 PM on the same morning, nine Japanese bombers were spotted over the port, flying from the southeast to the northwest. Taixing and Taixian both issued emergency reports, which were lifted at 12:55 PM. At around 1:00 PM in the afternoon, five Japanese transport ships were spotted at Longwokou, heading upstream from downstream. At the same time, there was also a Japanese transport ship and a large motorboat heading downstream from upstream, but neither stopped.

The fort built in front of the Japanese army headquarters in Xiannvmiao, Yangzhou, has not yet been completed. On the morning of the 27th, they continued to forcibly conscript civilian laborers and dismantle the brick walls of the houses north of Tongshi Bridge, transporting them to build the fort. Also, in the Gaomotou area, at around 5:00 AM on the 27th, about 80 to 90 Japanese troops from Shizhuang, together with Japanese troops who arrived from Rugao, came into contact with the Chinese Self-Defense Forces. It stopped at 11:00 AM. As a result, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties.

### Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangsu Fiercely Attack Jiangyin

Jiangyin Correspondence: At present, the urban area of Jiangyin has entered a state of terror and chaos, and the Japanese troops are wantonly harassing the vicinity of the city under the guise of "searching," causing innocent people to suffer injustice. The recent guerrilla activities and the suffering of the people in the county are recorded as follows:

Chinese Troops Fiercely Attack

The total number of the Chinese Loyal Patriotic Salvation Army is no less than 30,000, and they are equipped with some heavy weapons, posing a serious threat to the Japanese troops in the Chengxi area. Commander Yuan Yacheng's unit of over 300 men used light machine guns and rifles to fiercely attack the city under the eastern, southern, and northern walls at around 9:00 PM the day before yesterday. The gunfire was dense for about half an hour, and then they withdrew to their original defenses in formation. At that time, there were about 100 Japanese troops in the city, who lay down at the foot of the walls of the four city gates to avoid being hit by stray bullets. All the major and minor traitors, fearing that the city would be broken and they would be slaughtered, hid in the homes of relatives and friends, and dared not sleep soundly.

Fierce Battle at Zhouzhuang

Zhouzhuang Town, more than ten miles southeast of Jiangyin City, is famous for its cloth production. During the late Ming Dynasty, Yan Yingyuan, the national hero who led the county residents to resist the Qing soldiers for eighty-one days and nights, once lived in seclusion on Shasha Mountain south of the town. The place is known for its spiritual energy and outstanding talents. This time, the Japanese army felt that the strong morale of the people and the loyal and brave guerrillas in Jiangyin were particularly difficult to deal with. In late February, more than 30 Japanese troops went to the town to search, but were detected by the guerrillas, who surrounded Zhouzhuang Town on all sides and advanced to the vicinity of the street, resulting in fierce street fighting. All the guerrilla soldiers fought bravely, bombing forward with hand-held grenades. As a result, several guerrillas were killed in action, and more than ten civilians were wounded or killed, while no more than ten of the Japanese troops survived. Two days later, more than 100 Japanese troops, with several small steel cannons, set out from Jiangyin and planned to search Zhouzhuang again. When they approached the town, they came into direct contact with the guerrillas, and a fierce battle lasted for about five hours. At around 9:00 PM, the guerrillas surrounded the Japanese troops. Then Japanese reinforcements arrived and broke through the encirclement, retreating to the Caojia Village area, about six or seven miles from the city. Both sides suffered casualties. At the end of last month, more than 100 Japanese troops again took 13 small boats from Lujia Bridge, copied the back of Zhouzhuang, and landed on the top of Shasha Mountain, hoping to spy on the guerrillas' situation. After half a day, they gained nothing and left dejectedly.

Japanese Troops Harass

Regarding the situation of Japanese troops disturbing the people, according to investigations: (1) On February 20, at around 3:00 AM, several Japanese military policemen went to the Chen family near the Xiaochenghuang Temple in Dongmen, broke into the house, and set it on fire without asking why. They also pushed a lacquer worker (over 50 years old) living in the house into the flames and burned him to death. As a result, two houses were destroyed. It is said that this action of the Japanese army was based on a traitor's false report. (2) On February 22, more than ten Japanese naval soldiers, with small boats, went to the Duanshan Port of Quandong Township along the river. When the Jianglun rowing boats were unloading goods, they boarded the ship and forcibly robbed a cage of live chickens sold by vendors, totaling 120. As a result, merchants were frightened, and travelers were afraid to proceed.

### Chinese Troops in Qingpu Attack the County Seat; Puppet Official Lu Shoupeng Killed

Qingpu Correspondence: On the morning of the 7th, Qingpu was attacked by more than 100 Japanese and puppet troops from Baihejiang Town in northern Qingpu, led by Lu Shoupeng, the captain of the puppet police brigade, carrying small bronze cannons and light and heavy machine guns, traveling along the Dayingpu River in motorboats. The guerrilla unit of Fei Yiming stationed in the town received the report in advance, and together with Ling's unit from Zhaotun Bridge, cut off their retreat. The Japanese and puppet troops were unprepared and suffered heavy casualties. Seeing the situation was critical, the Japanese troops retreated in motorboats towards the Anqing Highway. Lu Shoupeng, the captain of the puppet police brigade, was also killed by the Chinese army. Fei's unit took advantage of the victory to advance towards the county seat, and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese troops stationed there near the Cha'an area, about three Chinese miles outside the north gate. For a time, gunfire erupted. The Japanese troops stationed in Qingpu heard the alarm and immediately set up steel cannons on the city towers to bombard, and after a fierce battle until dusk, two ocean bridges on the Qing'an Highway were destroyed, and they safely withdrew to their original defenses. The Japanese troops immediately conducted house-to-house searches in nearby villages, and many villagers were killed. Young women were all raped. The next morning, Fei Yiming's unit of the Chinese army again rushed into Cha'an. In addition to hastily fighting back, the Japanese troops fled into the city.

### Japanese Troops Attack Haiyan, Use Poison Gas; Chinese Troops Await Opportunity to Counterattack

Haiyan Correspondence: Since the Haiyan Chinese army base area was attacked by the Japanese troops on three routes on the 24th of last month, the Japanese army has not succeeded and has suffered heavy casualties. Therefore, in the mornings of the day before yesterday and yesterday, a large number of troops were transferred from Shanghai and began a full-scale offensive, with aircraft support. At this time, the officers and soldiers of the various units of the Chinese army were not afraid of the fierce artillery fire and continued to resist, so the positions did not move. Later, because the Japanese army could not win, they indiscriminately used poison gas. Almost all of the advance units of the Chinese army smelled the gas, were poisoned, and shed tears, so the first defense line was broken by the Japanese. The officers and soldiers of the Chinese army then defended the second defense line and continued to fight, eliminating many enemies, but due to the heavy casualties, they abandoned all the strongholds at the same time. Now the Chinese army has retreated to a certain place to concentrate, awaiting the opportunity to counterattack. According to a person who just came from that place, after the Japanese troops occupied Shendang, Ganpu, and Haiyan, they carried out large-scale burning and killing, and forcibly pulled farmers to find women. Then they forcibly forced the people who had not left to help build defensive works at various key points, dig trenches, and build artillery positions and set up sandbags overnight on the Changchuan area, an important road for the Chinese army to source supplies.

### Chen Lijiang Discusses China's Education in the Past Year (Part Two): The Calamities of the Cultural World, Though Unbearable to Recall, Offer Hope for the Revival of New Education in the Future

Regarding educational theory and thought, regardless of the person, faction, or publication, all consider the Three Principles of the People education as the highest category, with nationalism as the center. This is not merely a verbal assertion; in the practical implementation of education in China over the past year, there have been various innovations and advancements. The government's measures have shown significant reform and progress, and the dynamics of society have also exhibited substantial innovation and progress. Considering the government's measures, we can examine them in several aspects: higher education, secondary education, primary education, social education, frontier education, and others.

(A) Looking at higher education, there have been the following innovations and advancements: (1) "The Establishment of Normal Colleges": The Ministry of Education planned to establish six national normal colleges this year. This is an important measure to cultivate qualified teachers for secondary schools. Last October, the Ministry of Education also convened a National Higher Normal Education Conference, which involved important discussions and decisions on normal education issues. (2) "Adjustment of Departments in Colleges and Universities": Based on the needs of various industries nationwide, the Ministry of Education has made significant adjustments to the departments in various universities. For example, the National Northwest Institute of Technology was established through the merger and reorganization of the engineering colleges of Northwest Associated University, Northeast University, and Jiaozuo Institute of Technology. Yunnan Provincial University was changed to National University, etc. The list is not exhaustive. (3) "Relocation of Colleges and Universities to the Interior": This will have a positive effect on the development of culture in the interior. (4) "Organization of University Courses": Last September, the Ministry of Education published a list of compulsory courses for the colleges of liberal arts, science, and law. The compulsory courses for the colleges of agriculture, industry, and commerce have also been announced. (5) "Implementation of Unified Enrollment for National Colleges and Universities": In the past, each university recruited new students independently, without a rational plan for cultivating talents. Candidates often had to travel long distances, suffering losses in physical health, finances, and mental well-being. Last year, national colleges and universities implemented unified enrollment. (6) Planning for Employment of University Graduates and Relief for Unemployed Secondary School Graduates: In the past, university graduates faced the cry of "graduation equals unemployment." Last year, the Ministry of Education had comprehensive plans for the employment of university graduates, either introducing them to jobs or providing training to ensure that everyone can use their talents to the fullest. Recently, to provide relief to secondary school graduates who applied to universities but were not admitted, or who were unable to participate in entrance examinations for various reasons, the Ministry of Education has also established various specialized courses and university preparatory classes to seek relief. (B) Looking at secondary education, there have been the following innovations and advancements: (1) "The Establishment of Youth Training Outline": This is the most concrete plan for promoting youth training. From now on, there will be a definite basis for training youth. (2) "Continued Establishment and Improvement of National Secondary Schools": For example, adding National Anhui Secondary School, abolishing the school affairs committee of National Secondary Schools, implementing the principal system, etc. (3) "Curriculum Reform": Reducing the original curriculum, improving military training, enriching political education, and implementing wartime rear service are all significant improvements to meet wartime needs. (4) "Pilot Implementation of Student Camps": This is an experiment in new educational methods.

Ms. Wang Ximin was elected as the principal. A Western-style house at No. 57 Zhengjia Street, West Aixiangs Road, French Concession, was rented as the school building. Since the spring semester of last year, when enrollment began, there have been more than 250 students, divided into six grades in senior and junior high schools.

During the summer vacation, high school graduates who applied to famous universities in Shanghai were all admitted. When the second semester started, the number of students increased to more than 350. Classrooms were expanded and teachers were added. Because the school building was not enough, another newly built Western-style house was rented nearby and opened as a classroom so that students could attend classes all day. As a result, more and more students came to study. The school now has more than 3,000 books and magazines, and the physics and chemistry instruments are sufficient for general experiments. As for sports, it has all kinds of ball games such as basketball, volleyball, and baseball. The dormitory facilities are quite hygienic. The school's future is very promising.

### Charity Football: Tung Wah vs. Portugal, Held Tomorrow Morning Rain or Shine, Chen Hongguang Will Play as Defender, French Army Band Will Perform to Help

The third charity football match, organized by the Shanghai International Relief Association and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, will be held by the Portuguese team against Tung Wah at Yiyuan at 10:30 tomorrow morning. Because it is related to disaster relief, even if it rains, it will not be postponed and will still be played on time. At that time, more than 30 members of the French Army Band will participate in the performance to help. After the game, the third football will be auctioned off. It is found that the first one was auctioned off by Mr. Gao Huaide for 400 yuan, and the second one was auctioned off by Mr. Pu Zaiyuan for 500 yuan. I don't know who the third ball will fall into the hands of. The lineup of Tung Wah will be slightly changed tomorrow, and Chen Hongguang will play as a defender. The record is as follows:

Zhou Dayun Zhuang Youren Chen Hongguang Xu Chengdong Ji Shengsen Jiang Zhaoxiang Wan Jin Wan Xianghua Sun Huizhang Dai Linjing Shen Shiyan Jia Youliang

Public Announcement of Second Game Revenue and Expenditure: The revenue and expenditure of the previous second charity game (British Army United vs. Lido) of the Association has been calculated and announced by the International Relief Association and the Western Football Association as follows:

Revenue: 1,147 tickets of 1 yuan each, totaling 1,147 yuan, 2,121 tickets of 50 cents each, totaling 1,103 yuan, proceeds from the football auction (auctioned by Mr. Pu Zaiyuan), totaling 500 yuan, totaling 2,752 yuan in national currency

Expenditure: 10% donation to the French Concession Bureau, totaling 225 yuan and 20 cents

Miscellaneous expenses of Yiyuan (six items), totaling 252 yuan and 10 cents, police duty expenses, totaling 72 yuan

Expenses for Jewish refugees (25%), totaling 550 yuan and 70 cents

Expenses for Chinese refugees (75%), totaling 1,652 yuan

Totaling 2,752 yuan in national currency, the net expenses for Chinese refugees were 1,652 yuan, and the expenses for Jewish refugees were 550 yuan and 70 cents. The income from the second game was far less than that of the first game, partly due to the rain and partly because the game time was on Sunday morning, so only 3,357 tickets of 50 cents and 1 yuan were sold (according to the March 2nd edition of this newspaper, the first game was 9,365 tickets). This third game will also encounter rainy days, so enthusiastic relief workers are quite worried, but I hope that people from all walks of life can bravely watch the game to help the refugees.

### Today's Scott Cup Final Postponed, All Games Today May Be Difficult to Hold

The Scott Cup football final, Lido vs. Xipu, was originally scheduled to be held at Yiyuan at 2:30 pm today, but due to the continuous overcast and rainy days, the field was unbearable. The Western Football Association specially announced the postponement of the game yesterday. The remaining Group A French Commerce vs. Lax Reserve Group, Tung Wah vs. St. Francis, and two Group C games may also be difficult to hold as scheduled, but according to news from Jiaozhou Park, if it clears up today, the Tung Wah vs. St. Francis game may be able to be held.

### Chinese and Western Cross-Country Race Held Tomorrow Morning, Starting in Front of French Park with a Total of Eight Teams Participating

The first ten-mile Chinese and Western Open Group Cross-Country Championship, initiated and organized by the Sports Association of the British and French Army stationed in Shanghai, will be held in front of the French Park on Luban Road at 8:00 tomorrow morning, rain or shine. A total of eight teams will participate in the competition, with ten people on each team. The top eight will be selected. There are four individual participants, including athletes from China, Britain, and France. Participating athletes must register at 7:30. As for the strongest teams, Lido should be recommended. It has Wang Zhenglin, Zhang Liang, Ling Xuewen, Cao Shizhang, etc. The second is Huizhen, which also has Liu Guangfa, Li Duan, Xu Peishun, Lin Guoyou, etc. It is expected that the championship will be contested by Lido and Huizhen. According to the generals of Huizhen, taking advantage of the double championship in the Chinese and Western seven-mile race, they are ambitious and will definitely be able to compete with Lido. However, both team lists have the name of Li Duan, and I don't know how Li will divide himself. Dongsailai's strength is slightly inferior and can win the third place, but its experience is rich, and there may be upsets at that time. As for the fourth place, the French Army and Hongkou and Xifusi are vying for it. Other teams such as Youqiang and Hualian have mediocre talents and may be difficult to achieve anything. The full list of athletes is as follows:

(Lido) Wang Zhenglin, Zhang Liang, Ling Xuewen, Ai Youwen, Li Duan, Guan Shizhang Zhou Ruquan, Shen Jishun, Wu Xuecheng, Jing Qiangshi, (Hongkou) Wan Jinsheng, Chen Zixiang, Huang Cangguan, Jiang Jun, Chen Sihao, Tian Shuitang, Huang Wuyuan, Gu Qiming, Zhang Quanfa, Shen Cilin,

### After Successfully Securing a Loan of £10 Million: Establishment of a Management Committee, Designated Use to Stabilize the Value of Legal Tender, Subscription of the Loan by the Four Banks, Funds Deposited in the UK

In order to maintain the credit of legal tender, stabilize foreign exchange, facilitate commercial transactions, and make exchange rates reasonable and stable, our government has secured a loan of £10 million from four banks, HSBC, McCallum, China, and Jiaotong, to serve as an exchange rate stabilization fund. A fund management committee has been established. The details are as follows:

Distribution Method: The distribution method for the £10 million loan from the four banks is as follows: (1) HSBC, £3 million; (2) McCallum Bank, £2 million; (3) China and Jiaotong Banks, jointly responsible for £5 million. The term is temporarily set at twelve months, with an annual interest rate of 5.5%. The designated use of the loan is to maintain the stability of the value of legal tender and shall not be used for other purposes. The funds are deposited in the British banking industry.

Establishment of a Committee: It has been decided to establish a fund management committee for this loan. HSBC, McCallum, China, and Jiaotong Banks will each send one representative to be a member of the committee. The Ministry of Finance of our government and the Ministry of Finance of the British government will each send one representative to be a member of the committee. It is heard that the general headquarters will be established in London, England, and an office will be established in Hong Kong. The committee will be announced after the representatives of each bank and the government are appointed.

### Negotiations for the Return of Dredging Bureau Vessels Seized; It is Heard That the Two Sides are Close to Reaching a Conclusion Soon

The Shanghai Dredging Bureau's various dredgers, survey vessels, and passenger launches, totaling more than twenty vessels of all sizes, were forcibly seized by the Japanese side.  More than a year has passed since then, and they have not yet been returned. Consequently, dredging operations in various sections of the Huangpu River, the lower reaches of the Wusong River, and the Shentan sandbar outside the Wusong estuary have all been suspended.  Silt and sand drift with the currents, causing previous dredging work to be completely undone, and the degree of siltation is even worse than before dredging. This poses a significant hazard to navigation. As for the seized vessels, except for the "Jianshe" dredger, which remains moored on the Huangpu River near Yangshupu after being seized, all other vessels have been forcibly requisitioned for use in places such as Gaoqiao. Furthermore, Japanese puppet (Manchukuo) personnel have been dispatched to carry out dredging, usurping authority, which is extremely dissatisfying to various foreign shipping companies. Because the nature of the Dredging Bureau is international, its shipbuilding and all related expenses are derived from the dredging fees levied by the Customs from various foreign ships. Once dredging stops, the waterway is bound to be obstructed, and the rights and interests of third-country shipping merchants will be harmed.  For this reason, the Inspector General of Customs and the Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs have repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side for the return of the seized vessels and the resumption of dredging.  However, these negotiations have been ineffective. The crux of the matter is that the Japanese side also uses the Customs' employment of Japanese staff as an example, and demands that the Dredging Bureau must add Japanese staff as a condition. This matter is extremely unacceptable to the Bureau. However, it is now heard that negotiations are being re-initiated and are closer than before. It is generally believed that a conclusion can be reached soon.

### The "Hiliotomo" Has Not Yet Been Returned; The Greek Consul Is Determined to Negotiate Forcefully

The Greek merchant ship "Hiliotomo," chartered by the Norwegian trading company "Hua Lun Yang Hang" at Wuma Road and Sichuan Road in this city, arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month, carrying general merchandise from Tianjin.  Just as it was about to dock at the Longmao Warehouse in Pudong after entering the port, it was suddenly seized by the Japanese Navy and forced to sail to the center of the river at the Yangshupu Bridge and anchor, and was not allowed to unload cargo.  After the incident, the Greek Consul General in Shanghai lodged a protest with the Japanese side, demanding its immediate release.  However, the Japanese side falsely claimed that the ship's nationality was unclear and that it would be returned only after verifying that it was indeed a Greek merchant ship.  According to news from shipping circles, the "Hiliotomo" is indeed owned by Greek merchants, and the consulate has records to prove it. Since the Japanese side seized the ship, although they have falsely claimed to be investigating its nationality, they have not done so. The ship is still being detained and has not been released. It is heard that the Greek Consul is determined to make another forceful negotiation to protect the interests of Greek merchants.

According to the draft budget, the total regular income is 27,246,750 yuan, of which 2,272,370 yuan has been allocated to the education budget.

Before the various committees considered the budget, this number was reduced to 28,827,450 yuan. Subsequently, as a result of discussions among the heads of various departments, it was further reduced by 290,770 yuan. The surplus of 280,000 yuan from the Shanghai account for the purchase and sale of foreign rice was reallocated as funds for refugee relief. Thus, the total expenditures, excluding education expenses, amounted to 28,256,680 yuan. The above-mentioned income and expenditures offset each other, resulting in a net deficit of 2,946,850 yuan. In order to make up for this deficit, the Director of Finance suggested that, starting from July 1 of this year, the general municipal tax and the special municipal tax should each be increased by 2%, and the land tax should also be increased by the same proportion from the same date. The increased taxes and fees could generate approximately 1,250,000 yuan within half a year. As for the remaining deficit in the budget, it could be carried over to the next year's budget or made up for by other methods. The Director of Finance said that the amount of donations and subsidies given by the Council had not yet been determined when the budget was being prepared, and the effects of the recommendations made by the committee discussing the salaries and benefits of the staff had not been taken into account. Due to these two reasons, the budget still needed to be adjusted further. The Director also said that the calculation of foreign exchange rates was based on a ratio of 1 yuan in national currency to 8.5 pence in British gold. As for the special expenditures of various departments, the initial draft totaled 2,547,630 yuan. Some of these expenditures were deemed unnecessary by the various committees during the discussion of the draft and were removed. However, a supplementary budget was used to replace them. The total expenditures removed amounted to 755,600 yuan, and the supplementary budget totaled 32,500 yuan. Thus, the total special expenditures were 1,824,530 yuan, exceeding the expenditures of the previous year by 347,260 yuan. The Director of Finance said that a separate report would be made on the balancing of the special expenditure budget in due course.

The tax schedule applicable to this year was also considered by the Finance Committee on the 3rd of this month. The committee's recommendations are as follows: (1) Land Tax: From January 1 to June 30 of this year, land in the Public Concession will be taxed at a rate of 8 per thousand based on the assessed value. From July 1 of this year until the next annual meeting of taxpayers, the tax rate will be changed to 9 per thousand. This land tax will be prepaid by the land renter every six months. (2) General Municipal Tax: For houses in the Public Concession, a tax of 16% will be levied on the assessed rental value from April 1 to June 30 of this year. From July 1 of this year until the next annual meeting of taxpayers, a tax of 18% will be levied. This house tax will be prepaid by the resident every quarter. (3) Special Tax: For houses outside the Public Concession whose residents enjoy the convenience of various facilities and public services in the Concession, a tax of 14% will be levied on the assessed rental value from April 1 to June 30 of this year. From July 1 of this year until the next annual meeting of taxpayers, a tax of 16% will be levied, prepaid by the resident every quarter. On the 8th of this month, the Council Board of Directors resolved to approve the above-mentioned regular expenditure budget and tax schedule as proposed by the Finance Committee, but the additional donation provision was changed to take effect from October 1. The Director of Finance of the Municipal Council reported that the Council's accounts for the year 1938 were being audited. In summary, the total income (before deducting education expenses) was actually 24,742,403 yuan, an increase of 2,542,723 yuan compared to the budgeted income. The total expenditures were 26,602,647 yuan, exceeding the budget by 1,760,027 yuan. The two offset each other, resulting in a net deficit of 1,860,244 yuan, a reduction of 782,696 yuan compared to the budgeted deficit. According to the Director of Finance, the main reason for the increase in income was that the tax collection performance in the Northeast and Northwest districts was better than budgeted, and the number of vacant houses south of the Suzhou River was fewer than expected, and various licensed businesses were expanding. The difference between the budgeted and actual income for each item is listed below: Land Tax (more than budgeted, same below) 107,407 yuan, General Municipal Tax 1,222,119 yuan, Special Tax 179,862 yuan, License Fees 395,881 yuan, Public and Municipal Enterprise Income 338,979 yuan, Other Income 280,759 yuan, Education Fee Miscellaneous Income 17,716 yuan. As for the expenditures of various departments, except for donations, subsidies, and the expenses of the Public Works Department, they all exceeded the budget by a considerable amount. The main reason was the sharp drop in exchange rates in the second half of last year (the exchange rate when the budget was prepared last year was 1 shilling and 2 and 3/8 pence). Observing the exchange subsidies for pensions, retirement savings, and other retirement benefits, which accounted for almost all of the additional expenditures in the general category of 1,109,238 yuan, the impact of the soaring exchange rates is evident.

### More Than 10,000 Japanese Soldiers in China Mutiny Against War; They Destroyed Weapons and Refused to Land; They Were Detained at Tanggu and Sent Back to Their Home Country

According to a businessman from Tianjin who spoke to a reporter from the Modern News Agency yesterday, at the end of February, three Japanese transport ships carrying approximately 10,000 Japanese soldiers departed from Dalian. When they arrived at the Tanggu port, the Japanese soldiers on board refused to disembark and destroyed some of the weapons they were carrying. The order was chaotic. Although suppressed by high-ranking Japanese officers, the Japanese soldiers disobeyed orders, acted freely, and chanted anti-war slogans. Later, nearby Japanese warships arrived after hearing the news to suppress the situation and escorted the Japanese soldiers on the three ships back to their home country under surveillance. According to the businessman, he was in Tanggu at the time to purchase goods and witnessed the incident. The local people were panicked, and every household closed their doors. However, all newspapers in North China are run by the Japanese puppets, so there was not a single word about this unfavorable news, and people were forbidden to discuss it. Furthermore, incidents of Japanese soldiers stationed in various regions of North China committing suicide out of war-weariness also occurred from time to time.

### The Chinese Express Grief Over the Municipal Council's Tax Increase; The Increased Revenue is Only Enough for Salary Increases; The Public Does Not Benefit from the Prosperity of the Market

The "Continental Daily" stated that, regarding the resolution of the Municipal Council to increase the tax rate from 16% to 18%, taxpayers in the Public Concession will not mount an organized resistance to this. The reporter conducted a wide-ranging investigation yesterday (the 9th) and learned that although the majority of taxpayers do not approve of the tax increase, they also have no intention of opposing it. Foreigners in the Public Concession pay little attention to this news. However, Chinese taxpayers in the Public Concession, who are most affected, lament the tax increase. Furthermore, Japanese residents north of the Suzhou River also severely criticized this resolution. However, it is certain that Chinese taxpayers will not take any action to argue with the tax increase. A spokesperson for the association claimed that the Municipal Council is finding it difficult to balance its income and expenditures, so Chinese residents do not want to make things more difficult for the authorities. However, Chinese taxpayers also mentioned the salary increases for senior Municipal Council staff, firmly asserting that the senior staff of the Municipal Council should bear some responsibility for the necessity of the tax increase. This time, the tax increase will increase the Municipal Council's revenue by 1.25 million yuan per year, while the salary increases for senior staff will increase the Council's expenditures by 1 million yuan per year. Therefore, the tax increase is tantamount to filling the private pockets of the salaried employees. Furthermore, according to criticisms from various Chinese circles, the Municipal Council must have believed that the increased income of stores due to the prosperity of Shanghai's commerce would offset the tax increase. However, the Council does not know that the so-called prosperity does not benefit the public, especially the majority of Chinese taxpayers. Only large merchants and property owners benefit.

### The Bean and Rice Industry Holds a Management Meeting; Earnest Admonishment Not to Hoard or Speculate; Hoping That Merchants Will Resume Transportation

Regarding the city's food supply problem, since rice and grain from producing areas have been transported elsewhere by the Japanese puppets, the amount coming to Shanghai has decreased, causing prices to rise steadily and affecting the people's food supply. The Bean and Rice Industry Association has already resolved to strictly enforce price limits and not exceed them. The association believes that the prevailing trend of large households absorbing grain is seriously affecting the future of the people's food supply. Therefore, at 9:00 AM yesterday, it resumed holding the Market Management Committee meeting, chaired by Fu Qian'geng. It was resolved that each bean and rice firm should be earnestly admonished to share the difficulties of the times, not to hoard, not to speculate, not to manipulate, and to unanimously implement the association's resolution to maintain the price limit of 14 yuan, and to hope that merchants will purchase and transport grain from the producing areas as usual in order to enrich the source of food for the people.

### Ningbo Compatriot Association Decides to Purchase Foreign Rice; A Total of 100,000 Stones; Telegram Sent to the Ministry Requesting Foreign Exchange

The Ningbo Shanghai Compatriot Association planned to purchase rice in Shanghai and transport it to Ningbo in preparation for the spring famine. However, it failed because the Shanghai Jianghai Customs prohibited the export of rice. Recently, according to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter, the Ningbo Compatriot Association has now sent a letter to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, soliciting a joint request to the Ministry of Finance for foreign exchange to purchase 100,000 stones of foreign rice, and will submit a joint request to the Ministry of Finance as soon as the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce agrees, in order to alleviate the people's food supply.

### New Terrorist Incidents Occur in the Hongkou Area; Terrorists Change Tactics, Committing Arson Everywhere in the Quiet of the Night

The "terrorist" incidents in the Concession area have subsided as a result of the Municipal Council's efforts. However, new "terrorist" incidents are becoming active again in the Hudong area of the Hongkou district. Recently, terrorists in the Yangshupu district have been spreading throughout the back streets and alleys, and even hiding in empty houses. Every night, when people are sound asleep, they sneak out and commit arson, almost every night. These so-called "terrorist" incidents occur in areas governed by the Japanese side, making it difficult for the Japanese side to prevent them.

### The Prohibition of Using Legal Tender in North China Does Not Harm the Financial Market; Exchange Rates Are Smooth; All Inter-Bank Transfers Are in Legal Tender; All Banks Refuse to Accept "Lianquan"

Since the puppet government of North China prohibited the use of legal tender starting today, the issuance of legal tender in North China has increased unabated because the people deeply believe in legal tender and are happy to collect it. Shanghai banks have long been prepared and the financial market is unaffected. Exchange rates are smooth, and all inter-bank transfers are in legal tender. The details are as follows:

Promoting Lianquan by Prohibiting Legal Tender: After the "United Reserve Bank" of puppet North China failed to exchange legal tender and obtain foreign exchange by issuing banknotes, it forced the devaluation of legal tender in North China, and the puppet "North China Government" ordered the prohibition of legal tender circulation starting from March 11, all to promote the issuance of its "Lianquan". It also stipulated two zones: the "Lianquan Zone" and the "War Zone". The "Lianquan Zone" includes Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Taiyuan, Yantai, Shanhaiguan, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Linfen, Xinxiang, and other places, where the use of legal tender is prohibited and the use of "Lianquan" is forced. The "War Zone," which is controlled by guerrillas and cannot be reached by Japanese puppet troops, still uses legal tender as usual and cannot be prohibited.

People Collect More Legal Tender: Although the circulation of legal tender in North China has been repeatedly sabotaged by the Japanese puppets, such as forcibly devaluing it and prohibiting its use, the people of North China are happy to collect it because the legal tender is well-prepared. As for the puppet banknotes, they are paid out as soon as they are received. Thus, in places like Tianjin in North China, not only is it not used at a discount, but there is also an additional 20 to 30 yuan per thousand yuan, which proves that the value of legal tender is above "Lianquan." The issuance of legal tender in North China has increased unabated. As of February 18 this year, the Bank of China had 162,233,100 yuan, the Bank of Communications had 78,500,000 yuan, the Central Bank had 36,559,905 yuan, and the China South Bank, China Industrial Bank, Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Reclamation Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, etc., had 4,860,000 yuan.

Shanghai Finance Unaffected: A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the prohibition of legal tender circulation in North China has absolutely no impact on the Shanghai financial market, because Shanghai banks have long been prepared. After that, legal tender will still circulate as usual in the concessions of Tianjin in North China and in the guerrilla areas, and all receipts and payments will be in legal tender. Therefore, the puppet "North China Government's" prohibition of legal tender circulation is of no help in fact. The exchange between banks and various places in North China is still smooth, and inter-bank transfers are still in legal tender. Shanghai banks uniformly refuse to accept "Lianquan." However, Chinese banks in North China, Beijing, and other places are facing sharp declines in business due to the oppression of the Japanese puppets.

Full Exercise Without Doubt: Even if the legal tender issued by our Tianjin Bank of China and Bank of Communications is forcibly stopped from circulating in the occupied areas after March 11, it will still be able to fully exercise in the embassy circles in Beijing, the Tianjin concession area, and the inland villages, because the exchange rate with foreign currency remains stable and the people's confidence is increasing day by day. Moreover, all international commercial payments and receipts, and the buying and selling of agricultural and industrial products, use our legal tender as the means of payment and receipt. The successful loan of 10 million pounds this time has made the value of legal tender more stable and consolidated, and Chinese and foreign people have increased their belief in our country's legal tender, so the financial community does not pay attention to the prohibition of legal tender in North China.

### Unemployment Statistics for Shanghai Workers; The Total is Approximately 300,000; People from All Regions are Included

The Shanghai "Times" stated yesterday (the 9th) that, according to statistics from the China Section of the International Labor Office in Geneva, there are currently 300,000 unemployed male and female workers in Shanghai. Unemployment is a common occurrence in any major city, but before the outbreak of the Shanghai War in 1937, Shanghai was known as the "colony of the unemployed." Shanghai has a total number of White Russian immigrants, which has increased due to the arrival of new White Russians from Harbin. The Hongkou district also has Japanese, and their unemployment rate is also high. In addition, there are countless unemployed Chinese who previously worked around the Shanghai concessions. Recently, several thousand unfortunate European Jews have arrived with their families, so the number of unemployed of various nationalities has increased again. The Chicken People's District in Nanshi also accommodates thousands of refugees, and it is heard that many Chinese who have withdrawn from Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places have gone to Shanghai. Some of them stay in Shanghai, while others, seeing that it is difficult to make a living and that the cost of living in Shanghai is quite high, immediately go elsewhere to seek a livelihood. This situation has reached a focal point, and Chinese and foreign stores have resumed large-scale cost-cutting, and many people will lose their jobs as a result. Although everyone agrees that times are bad, at the end of last year, the local commercial and trade situation was still fairly satisfactory. Many major department stores made substantial profits, and it is heard that one or two of them earned as much as 6 million yuan. The majority of Chinese banks and money shops also made substantial profits. Although a small number of Chinese stores voluntarily liquidated, very few were forced to close. However, well-informed business circles in Shanghai expect that the local commercial situation will not return to its pre-war state without a long period of time. Of the 800,000 unemployed male and female workers in 1937, approximately 500,000 have found work in Chinese factories that have recently opened in the Public Concession. If this statistic of reduced unemployment is indeed true, then the status of the local industry seems to be better than before.

### Foreign Shipments of Rice and Grain Refused Visas by Japanese Authorities: Inland River Companies Exclusively Control Yangtze River Shipping; Ports Such as Baimao and Yanglin to be Blockaded

Regarding the Japanese control of Yangtze River shipping and the squeezing of foreign business interests, active progress has been made and is gradually becoming concrete. The existing foreign ships operating at various ports are being subjected to extreme difficulties, and the issuance of procurement certificates is being refused. It is reported that ports such as Liuhe, Qiyakou, Hupu, and Changyinsha will be served by vessels of inland river companies, which are essentially disguised subsidiaries of the Nisshin Shipping Company. Other ports are being blockaded. The following is a report from a reporter of the Xiandai News Agency on the situation:

Foreign Ships Loading Cargo Refused Visas: The Japanese are extremely hostile towards foreign ships operating on the Yangtze River. They are using special violence to arbitrarily inspect passengers and goods at various ports, causing significant losses to foreign businesses. Unexpectedly, since March, the Japanese authorities have implemented a goods import and export procurement certificate system, resorting to extreme obstructionist tactics. The British firm Jardine Matheson's Tonghe Shipping Company, which was scheduled to sail to Hupu last week to load rice and grain for Shanghai, was refused a procurement certificate by the Japanese authorities. Therefore, the vessel remains anchored outside the port, and negotiations are underway with the local garrison. Similarly, the German firm Reiss & Co.'s Jiangding, the Qianxin Shipping Company's Kaisteng, and the Changfeng Shipping Company's Xin Jiangnan are only permitted to carry passengers and a small amount of cargo but are not allowed to load rice and grain, cotton, etc. In addition, the Yita Shipping Company's Alexander, which operates to Changyinsha, Hupu, and other ports, is also prohibited from loading cargo.

Inland River Companies Take Over Navigation: Regarding the future of shipping on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, it will be served by vessels of the Jiangzhe Inland River Shipping Company, an affiliated organization of the Nisshin Shipping Company. Earlier this month, Asano, a Japanese representative of the company, visited various ports on the southern bank of the Yangtze River and, after visiting Takahashi, the garrison commander of Changshu, Taicang, and Jiangyin, began consulting with the puppet organizations of each county to discuss navigation methods. It is expected that this will be realized within this month. It is also understood that the company has made arrangements for inland river shipping (operating in the Suzhou Creek area), establishing a transport hub in Kunshan. Subsequently, foreign small ships will be excluded by the company. It is reported that foreign firms have decided to strive together to protect their interests in China.

Jiangnan Ports to be Blockaded: According to sources in the shipping industry contacted by the Xiandai reporter, the Japanese authorities will implement a blockade of various ports on the southern bank of the Yangtze River, such as Xiaochuansha (under Baoshan County), Yanglin and Dangqi (under Taicang County), and Baimao and Fushan (under Changshu County). In the future, only the four ports of Liuhe, Qiyakou, Hupu, and Changyinsha will be open.

### Japanese Side Solely Resumes Navigation on Lower Yangtze River: Japanese Merchant Ships with Blackened Funnels Operated by Yuyun Shipping Company

The shipping rights of foreign shipping companies on the Yangtze River have not been restored since the Japanese authorities forcibly closed the river under the pretext of military operations. Despite repeated strong protests, no results have been achieved, causing significant losses to the various companies. It is reported that the Japanese have now independently resumed navigation from Jiangyin upstream to Hankou, sending vessels to carry passengers and goods, and the business is quite developed. The details are as follows:

Initially Reopened Jiangyin Route: On the Yangtze River, the Japanese authorities first independently reopened the Shanghai-Jiangyin route last year, deploying the Japanese vessel Haimen Maru, which travels back and forth. The funnel has been painted black, ostensibly acting as a transport ship, making a round trip every four days, with one sailing from Shanghai every four days, docking at the Weisaigong Wharf in Pudong. Each trip is mostly passengers, with fewer goods.

Then Reopened Wuhan Route: After the opening of Wuhan, the Japanese authorities have further independently opened the Shanghai-Hankou route, dispatching the Rokuchi Maru and Naruto Maru (both owned by the Osaka Company), with blackened funnels, still resembling transport ships in appearance, but actually carrying both passengers and goods. They also call at Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Datong, Anqing, Jiujiang, Wuxue, Huangshi Port, and other ports. Passenger traffic is also dominant, as inland traffic has not yet recovered, so there are very few goods. The vessels dock at the Osaka Wharf in Pudong, Shanghai, departing approximately every seven days (because navigation is not possible at night in several sections of the river, each round trip takes fourteen days).

### Commander of the 17th Army Corps Commends Boy Scouts: Du Yuesheng and Wang Xiaolai Also Send Telegrams of Condolence

The Boy Scouts of the 50th Regiment of this city have been handling rescue work with the army and have achieved remarkable results. Recently, the headquarters of the 7th Army Corps specially issued a commendation order, stating, "After investigating, this regiment has worked diligently and its records are detailed, which is highly commendable and should be commended by order. Let this be known." In addition, the regimental affairs committee also sent a telegram of condolence, stating, "Your telegram and winter letter are received. We are deeply saddened by the death of troop member Cang Chengquan in Guizhou due to illness contracted in the line of duty. We are also deeply concerned about the injuries and illnesses of troop members Zhang Desun, Xu Defu, Li Bingkui, and Wang Shouchun due to overwork. Please convey our condolences to the family of troop member Cang, and extend our condolences to each of the other members. Upon the final victory, this committee will submit a request for awards to be conferred separately to commend their efforts." Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Jin Runyang, sincerely.

### Shanghai Municipal Council: Registration of New Rickshaw Pullers Limited to 38,000

The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, because the licenses for rickshaw pullers had expired, issued new licenses at Gordon Road from January 23 to February 14. Due to the large number of rickshaw puller vacancies, it has been decided to conduct a supplementary registration of new rickshaw pullers starting on the 15th of this month. Those rickshaw pullers who have pulled their rickshaws for 15 shifts or more each month will be given priority in registration, and the registration will be limited to 38,000. Yesterday, a special notice was issued to all rickshaw businesses to check and proceed accordingly.

### Cai Dingxin Appointed as Puppet "Director of the Trademark Bureau"

The puppet "Ministry of Industry of the Reformed Government" recently appointed Cai Dingxin as the puppet "Director of the Trademark Bureau." He assumed office on February 15 and relocated the bureau to No. 24 Sichuan Lane, North Sichuan Road, Shanghai.

### Quantai Bank Suspends Operations

Quantai Remittance Bank, located at No. 310 Sichuan Road in this city, was established in August of last year with a capital of 8,000 yuan, handling various remittance businesses. Due to differences of opinion among the shareholders, the bank announced its closure the day before yesterday. The bank is currently handling the aftermath.

### Guerrilla Unit of Fan Min Recovers Key Town of Nanqiao: More Than 40 Japanese Officers and Soldiers Killed; Both Sides are Deploying for Fierce Fighting

The Fan Min guerrilla unit, which is lying low in the Qianjiaqiao area of Songjiang, received a tip-off that a large contingent of Japanese troops had arrived in Nanqiao. Fan led all his warriors in a surprise attack the night before last (the 7th), taking the Japanese troops completely by surprise. The Japanese troops scrambled to prepare for battle. After less than an hour of fighting, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand the assault and fled in disarray. The guerrillas killed one Japanese unit commander, Nakajima, and more than 40 soldiers. The Fan unit suffered two warrior deaths and three wounded, with no other losses. The unit captured many light and heavy machine guns, ammunition, and weapons, and Nanqiao was recovered by Fan. It is now reported that the Japanese troops are mobilizing reinforcements, and the Fan unit has also made comprehensive deployments, preparing to fight the Japanese troops to the death.

Fighting at Bailianjing: Since the restoration of smooth passage through various ferry crossings such as Zhoujiadu and Nantoutou in the South Huangpu area, as well as Bailianjing and Liuliqiao, the Bailianjing-Liuliqiao ferry service was suspended again starting on the 10th. It is reported that the guerrilla forces in the Punan area have been quite active in recent days. A guerrilla battle once occurred in Bailianjing on the 9th. After completing their mission, the guerrillas left, resulting in tightened security in the area, and the various ferry crossings have been blockaded again. Although the Nantoutou-Zhoujiadu ferry service is operating as usual, inspections are quite strict, and there are very few travelers.

Beijing-Shanghai Railway Under Control: The Wang Jinshan special forces unit, operating in the western suburbs of Shanghai, is active on the border of the extraterritorial road construction area. Wang's regular forces, as well as the Fifth Column and First Detachment concurrently commanded by Wang, crossed the Punan area, passed through Minhang, and reached the western suburbs of Shanghai. The Third Detachment, led by Bao Yunting, and the Sixth Detachment, led by Chen Yi, went directly from the western suburbs of Shanghai to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, controlling and destroying the railway line in the Weiting area between Kunshan and Suzhou. They have also occupied Changshu and other places on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway.

Ding Xishan Receives Important Position: Ding Xishan, commander of the Eighth Detachment of the Loyal Salvation Army, has been commissioned by Gu Zhutong, commander of the Third War Area, as the Deputy Commander of the Third Security Zone of Jiangsu Province. Ding was sworn into office in XX, and Gu Cai’gen, the commander of the Sixth Battalion, was promoted to the commander of the Eighth Detachment.

### Old Zhabei Police Search Two Hotels: Oriental and Far Eastern Suddenly Searched; Two People Arrested, Both Drug Offenders

The Zi Lin Bao reports that the Old Zhabei Police search team and patrol reserve team, accompanied by the White Russian Business Corps, conducted a large-scale search of the Oriental and Far Eastern hotels on Yu Qiaqing Road last night (the 9th). Within minutes of their arrival, the White Russian Business Corps, wearing steel helmets, surrounded both hotels, sealing off all possible escape routes. The police officers, divided into several teams, each carrying a handgun, first entered the Oriental Hotel to search. A number of reserve Indian police and plainclothes detectives wearing steel-wire vests were stationed in the lobby at the entrance. A number of Chinese men and women in the lobby were also prohibited from entering or leaving. Within minutes, two people were arrested and escorted out of the hotel. They were found to be carrying drug paraphernalia and a white powder, presumably heroin. The two men were arrested on the roof after they were seen fleeing up to the roof with the drug paraphernalia upon hearing the search team enter the building. Other search teams thoroughly searched each room, checking everything from shoes and hats to bedding. They even inspected the hot water in the bathtub of a guest who was in the middle of bathing. After half an hour, they found nothing else. At 10 p.m., the search team immediately entered the Far Eastern Hotel and carried out the same procedure. A few minutes later, they also seized some drug paraphernalia, but the drug users had already escaped, so no one was arrested. The reporter accompanied the search team to both hotels and saw the detectives' thorough search, leaving no corner or crevice unchecked. At 10:30 p.m., the inspection was completed, and the detectives left the hotel together, boarding the police cars waiting outside and returning to the police station. The White Russian Business Corps also returned in trucks. Those who had been standing by watching since the beginning of the search then swarmed to the two hotels to inquire, and the scene was filled with noise. The search was directed by Assistant Commissioner of Police Robertson and others.

### Opium Found Under a Seat on a Public Bus: The Owner Could Not Be Found, and the Court Ordered Confiscation

The police authorities of the International Settlement have always maintained strict security in the western district. Since the Japanese authorities have repeatedly protested under the pretext of terrorist incidents, the security and searches have been particularly strict. The search teams in armed security vehicles patrol the various areas of the western suburbs almost every day, inspecting pedestrians and vehicles. At 4:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, while a large team of detectives was searching on Connaught Road and Yanping Road, a No. 10 public bus passed by. The detectives boarded the bus and searched it, finding a package of opium weighing more than 17.5 taels under one of the seats. All of the passengers on the bus at the time denied being the owner of the package, and the seat was also vacant, so the opium owner could not be found. The opium was taken back to the Gordon Road police station and sent to the First Special District Court yesterday. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the circumstances of the opium seizure. Judge Meng then ordered confiscation.

### Son of TASS Chief Missing: Search Continues Without Success; Family Uses Radio to Inquire

Sixteen-year-old Russian boy Sterlyaikov, the son of the Shanghai branch chief of the TASS News Agency, has been missing since the morning of February 14. Some say he has gone to Chongqing to join the army, but inquiries have been made domestically using radio and other methods, without a trace. Others suspect he has boarded a ship to the United States, so the Sterlyaikov family has asked the radio stations in San Francisco and Manila to send out calls to inquire on overseas ships. The United Press International has also agreed to widely publicize his disappearance in order to find out his whereabouts.

### Korean Drug Trafficker and Chinese and Russian Accomplices to Be Sentenced

Koreans established a morphine-selling operation at No. 8, Lane 164, Avenue du Dépôt, in the French Concession. The operation was busted by the French Concession police on January 28. The main culprit, a Korean, escaped, but his accomplices, White Russian Magorov (transliteration) and Chinese Huang Zhanglin, were arrested on the spot, and the seized morphine was taken to the police station.

### Gathering for Mahjong, Taking the Opportunity to Steal: 100 Yuan in Legal Tender Stolen; Two Suspects Detained Pending Interrogation

Chen Bosan, the owner of a small cigarette and paper shop at No. 732 Tiantong Road, was a habitual gambler. During the Lunar New Year, his gambling enthusiasm increased. He often invited friends and relatives who visited his shop to play mahjong in the bedroom upstairs. Yao Niansheng, from Zhenjiang, was also a frequent guest. On the Lantern Festival, Chen suddenly discovered that 100 yuan in new legal tender hidden on top of the cabinet in the room had disappeared. After carefully considering the relationship of those who had entered his room, Yao was the only suspect. Chen reported the information to the Huisi police station in charge, which sent detectives to investigate. Yao denied the theft, and there was no corroborating evidence, so the matter was temporarily put aside. Chen's seven-year-old daughter, Xin, only told her father the day before yesterday that she had seen Yao standing on a chair in the room after 10 a.m. on the Lantern Festival, with his hand reaching towards the top of the cabinet. Chen then took his daughter back to the police station to accuse Yao of theft. Yao was arrested a second time and admitted to the theft without hesitation. However, he said that 54 yuan of the stolen money had been lost gambling, 26 yuan had been used to repay a debt to the cigarette and paper shop at No. 102 Kaifeng Road, and the remaining money was given to Liu Kunming, a local shoemaker living at No. 21 Gaoshou Lane, Elgin Road, to help cover things up for fear of being discovered. He had borrowed 50 yuan from someone and gave it to Liu along with his remaining funds. The police chief immediately ordered the detectives in charge to arrest Liu. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated the case, saying that Yao had already confessed to the theft and should be punished according to the law. As for Liu's acceptance of Yao's money, saying that it was for mediation to avoid being detained, it seemed that there was a suspicion of intimidation and fraud, so Liu's part still needed to be investigated. Yao Niansheng confessed to the theft and admitted to giving Liu 70 yuan to help with the matter. Liu Kunming said that Yao entrusted him to settle the matter with the original owner and gave him 70 yuan, which he then transferred to Shen Agen, instructing him to return it to the original owner. However, Chen Bosan said that he did not know Liu at all, and no one had returned the money. Judge Dai reviewed the confessions and ordered that Yao and Liu both be returned to custody and that the hearing be rescheduled.

### Two British Soldiers Commit Suicide: One Died in the Home of a Russian Woman, One Died in Camp; Both Used Official Handguns to Shoot Themselves

The English-language Great American Evening Post reports that two British soldiers stationed in the city died last night (the 9th). According to all appearances, they both committed suicide using official firearms. The two men were soldiers of the Royal Marines from the British warship Theseus, one being Clemont, age 20, and the other being Sergeant Hawkins of the British Royal Army Regiment, age 40. Clemont died in a lodging in the French Concession. The firearm used was a .45 caliber official handgun. Hawkins died in the barracks on Avenue Haig. The firearm used was an official rifle. Clemont landed yesterday evening and went to the home of a Russian woman he knew at No. 207, Lane 613, Avenue Joffre, around midnight. The woman had gone to a tavern. Clemont apparently entered the Russian woman's room through the balcony and window. At around 12:30 a.m., the host and hostess of the lodging were awakened by a loud noise and, along with another lodger, went upstairs to tell the person in the room not to make noise and disturb others. They then went downstairs. Five minutes later, they heard a light knock on the floor and a moan coming from upstairs. The lodging owner went back upstairs to investigate and found the door locked. With the help of the servant, he broke down the door and saw Clemont lying in a pool of blood, blood flowing from his right chest. There was a British official handgun next to him, and he was still breathing. He drank tap water. It was heard that Clemont fired the shot himself after drinking the water. The gun was not his own but belonged to the ship. The lodging owner summoned an ambulance and the police, but he died in the hospital after the ambulance arrived. Hawkins died in the barracks bedroom. This morning, other British soldiers found him lying stiff on the ground, with a gunshot wound near his right eye. An official rifle was next to him. It was discovered that he had died. Other British soldiers had last seen him at 8:30 p.m. last night. The reasons for the suicides remain a mystery. Hawkins had served in the military for 20 years.

### Small Clerk in Customs Brokerage Firm Embezzles Funds: Sentencing Scheduled for 17th

Mao Zhenyu, a 23-year-old from Taicang, was introduced by Lu Songwu, the deputy manager of the Tongfa Customs Brokerage Firm at No. 78 Rue des Pères, in the French Concession, and entered the Tongfa Customs Brokerage Firm as a small clerk, earning only seven yuan a month. Unexpectedly, Mao had a fanciful idea of ​​falsifying the receipts issued by Taikoo and other shipping companies, adding hundreds of yuan to the amount on the receipts, and deceiving the company's accounting department into claiming the money for his own use. Over the course of a year, the amount reached a total of 3,163 yuan and 30 cents. He used 2,000 yuan to marry a wife and rent a house at No. 78 Yuli, Route des Soeurs. Recently, Xiao Zheming, the Cantonese general manager of the firm, discovered Mao's deceitful scheme and hired lawyer Qian Zheng to report it to the French police station, which detained Mao for interrogation and investigation at the Second Special Court, scheduling another hearing. All the details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Minsheng resumed the hearing in Criminal Division 1. The French Concession Administrative Authority's lawyer, Xi Zhen, filed a charge of occupational embezzlement. The plaintiff was represented by lawyer Qian, who also filed a civil suit, seeking to recover the embezzled funds. Mao Zhenyu admitted that he had worked at the Tongfa Customs Brokerage Firm for seven years, earning a monthly salary of seven yuan, and had resigned on December 18 of the previous year. He admitted to falsifying the receipts of the Taikoo Company, adding hundreds of yuan to the amounts, and deceiving the company into claiming the money, embezzling a total of about 2,000 yuan in just three months. The court reviewed the confessions and ordered the trial concluded, scheduling sentencing for the 17th. The defendant was returned to custody.

### Kidnapping and Selling a Nephew: Sentencing Scheduled

Zou Qinshi, a 34-year-old woman from Pudong, already has a five-year-old son. She recently became pregnant and was due to give birth at the end of last year. Because there was no one to take care of her five-year-old son, Zhou Maotou, she entrusted Maotou to the care of her cousin, Zhou Zou (who lives at No. 54 Yuchang Lane, Rue du Marché, in the French Concession). Unexpectedly, on January 27 of this year, Zou Baisheng, Zou Qinshi's husband's younger brother, went to Zhou Zou's house, ostensibly to visit the child, but instead kidnapped Maotou and sold him to Zhao Xushi (age 30, of Shanghai County), at No. 16 Avenue Bugeaud, for 33 yuan. After Zou Qinshi gave birth and left the hospital a month later, she learned that her son had been kidnapped and began searching everywhere. It was only recently that she learned that her son had been kidnapped by her husband's younger brother, Zou Baisheng, and sold to Zhao Xushi as a son. She reported the matter to the French police station the day before yesterday, and Zou Baisheng and Zhao Xushi were arrested. The child was also retrieved and returned to the mother. Zou and Xu were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Minsheng presided over the hearing in Criminal Division 1. The French Concession Administrative Authority's lawyer filed charges of disrupting the family. Zou Baisheng confessed that he had kidnapped and sold his nephew because he was in dire financial straits. Zhao Xushi confessed that she did not know that the child had been kidnapped, so she dared to buy him and begged for leniency. The court reviewed the confessions, declared the trial concluded, and scheduled sentencing. The defendants were returned to custody.

### Bank Director He Gusheng Actually Converts Private Property into Gambling Dens, Which is Extremely Harmful to Society

He Gusheng, a director of a certain bank, purchased a large piece of real estate at No. 864 Avenue du Roi Albert, in the western suburbs of Shanghai. In the center of the property, there is a magnificent mansion, surrounded by a large amount of open space. It is reported that He recently rented out the open space to a large gambling den for a term of three years, for a total rent of 72,000 yuan. The designs have now been completed, and the gambling houses will be built soon. From then on, in addition to the Hollywood Paradise Casino, another large-scale gambling den will be discovered on Avenue du Roi Albert. However, the most frustrating thing is that He Gusheng, who holds an important position in the financial world, is now only interested in making profits and actually leases his own land to gambling dens, which are harmful to society and full of evil, which is extremely regrettable.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Fluctuates Uncertainly; Gold Price Plummets and Briefly Rebounds; Lowest Point Reached 2044 Yuan

Yesterday's spot gold market in this city was extremely volatile. Because of the sharp easing of foreign exchange, followed by a sudden return to equilibrium, the gold price rose sharply amidst the downward trend. After suffering four consecutive days of decline and hearing of a sharp easing of foreign exchange, with British gold reaching eight and a half pence, gold dealers first sold aggressively. Securities brokers and northern brokers also began selling after making slight advances. For a time, buyers were at a loss, causing prices to plummet by more than 40 yuan, successively breaking through the four major levels of 2090 to 2050 yuan, falling to a low of 2044 yuan. Compared with the unprecedented high of 2200 yuan last Saturday, it fell by more than 156 yuan. Upon hearing that foreign exchange was tightening again, the northern brokers temporarily stopped selling. Therefore, with the double buying pressure from money changers and gold shops, it rebounded to outside the 2060 yuan level. In the early afternoon, the northern brokers resumed selling, causing it to fall to 2050 yuan. However, foreign exchange remained tight, and money changers increased their purchases, eventually leading to a surge to 2075 yuan. However, this was still a sharp drop of 23 yuan compared to the previous day's closing, although the fluctuations were quite large and there were no major waves. Everyone was uneasy, and trading was very active, with 1,220 taels changing hands. Gold jewelry also fluctuated unusually, rising and falling, changing five times throughout the day, and eventually falling by 3 yuan. Customs gold remained stable, but British pure gold and other items rose slightly.

Spot Gold Plunges Heavily, Down Another 23 Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially heard that foreign exchange was easing, so most buyers waited and watched. The selling price was reduced from 2100 yuan to 90 yuan before any trading occurred. Initially, a spot gold dealer sold 50 taels each to gold dealers and securities brokers at 2090 yuan, which was the opening price, 8 yuan lower than the previous close. After the opening, because there was a greater lack of buyers, the downward trend was quite severe. The spot gold dealer sold another 50 taels to money changers at 80 yuan, and a gold shop sold 50 taels to money changers at 68 yuan. At that time, securities brokers continued to purchase, so it rose slightly. The securities brokers vigorously purchased 100 taels at 68 yuan and 75 yuan (all sold by a certain Hong of a gold shop). Before long, the securities brokers suddenly stopped buying and sold aggressively, selling 50 taels to money changers at 75 yuan. During this time, it was heard that the easing of foreign exchange was intensifying, buyers cautiously waited and watched, and the securities brokers did not hesitate to sell cheaply, so the downward trend intensified again. The securities brokers sold 50 taels to money changers at 65 yuan, and another 50 taels to money changers, falling to 45 yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold shop also sold 50 taels to money changers at 44 yuan, which was the lowest price. Afterwards, it was heard that the easing of foreign exchange had stopped and turned tight, so it triggered buying. The money changers and local brokers purchased 100 taels from their peers at 50 yuan (the sellers were the ones who had previously purchased and profited from the liquidation). Later, a certain gold shop sold 50 taels to gold dealers at 47 yuan, a gold shop purchased 20 taels from money changers at 90 yuan, money changers purchased 50 taels from gold shops at 55 yuan, and gold shops traded 50 taels among themselves, with the price jumping to 65 yuan, and then another 50 taels traded between them at 63 yuan. It was already noon. In the afternoon, money changers first traded 50 taels among themselves at 60 yuan. Later, the securities brokers came to sell again, continuing the decline. The securities brokers sold 50 taels to gold shops at 50 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange was softening again, and a certain money changer suddenly developed a buying interest, causing it to repeat the rise, purchasing 50 taels from securities brokers at 54 yuan. Afterwards, the securities brokers stopped selling, so the upward trend intensified again, raising it directly to outside the 70 yuan level. Gold dealers purchased 50 taels from money changers at 74 yuan, and a certain money changer purchased 200 taels at 75 yuan (supplied by securities brokers, gold shops, and their peers). Afterwards, another money changer slightly sold off, but buyers remained on the sidelines, so although the price was shouted down to 72 yuan, it was still difficult to find a counterpart, so the closing price was still set at 2075 yuan. As a result, it fell by 23 yuan compared to the previous day's closing (already falling for five days, totaling 115 yuan). The selling price of the spot gold dealer's own brand of gold was 2085 yuan, and the buying price was 2070 yuan. The current margin gold is hanging at 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is no trading.

Gold Jewelry Changes Five Times, Ultimately Falling a Small 3 Yuan

The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael was not changed. Then, at 9:52 AM, because the spot gold had opened weakly, it was also lowered by a small 1 yuan. At 10:05 AM, spot gold continued to soften, so it was lowered by another small 2 yuan. Later, at 10:55 AM, the potential of spot gold became more weak, so it was lowered by another small 2 yuan. At noon at 12:00 PM, because the spot gold had slightly rebounded, it was also raised by 1 yuan. At 3:55 PM in the afternoon, because the spot gold continued to rebound, it also followed with another 1 yuan. As a result, it fell by 3 yuan compared to the previous day's close. Datongxing and Laoqingyun suspended at 210 yuan, and Xintongxing was 208 yuan, purchasing at 202 yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Briefly Tightens in the Afternoon; British Gold Reaches Eight and a Half Pence

Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was filled with the selling by the pseudo-"North China Reserve Bank," the Chinese cotton yarn dealers, and speculators, so the potential was quite loose. It is estimated that British gold reached as high as eight and a half pence, and the US exchange rate also rose to 16.5625 yuan. Later, because the "North China Reserve Bank" resumed purchasing, combined with the Hong Kong Telegraph Company's continued buying, the potential turned soft. However, the result was still slightly loose, with significant fluctuations and brisk trading. The Hong Kong exchange rate followed the fluctuations of the British and American exchange rates, initially easing to 56.875 yuan, then slightly tightening, with the result continuing to ease.

In the early morning, the London large bills were short 0.0625 in the near term and long 0.0625 in the far term. The New York spot price was unchanged. The London raw gold rose by half a penny.

The bank's opening selling price in the morning was 8.34375 pence for the British exchange rate and 16.3125 yuan for the US exchange rate, with no changes compared to the previous close. After the opening, the pseudo-"North China Reserve Bank" first sold aggressively, and Chinese speculators also followed suit, so the potential stepped loose. The North China pseudo-bank and Chinese speculators successively sold British exchange rates to HSBC, Anda, Youli, and a certain bank, from 8.390625 pence to 8.4375 pence, and the US exchange rate also rose from 16.40625 yuan to half a yuan. The HSBC listing was unchanged. The silver balance tax fell 0.025 yuan, calculated at 7.75 percent. Subsequently, Chinese cotton yarn dealers also came to sell, so the easing trend continued. The cotton yarn dealers sold British exchange rates to HSBC at 8.5 pence and sold US exchange rates to a certain bank at 16.5625 yuan. At that time, the "North China Reserve Bank" suddenly resumed purchasing, causing the easing trend to immediately tighten. The North China pseudo-bank purchased British exchange rates from foreign banks at 8.4375 pence. Near noon, various money changers frequently sold Hong Kong exchange rates, and foreign banks were not enthusiastic, so the situation was quite tight. The money changers sold Hong Kong exchange rates to Anda, Holland, and Huayi from 56.75 yuan to 56.875 yuan. The noon closing bank selling price was 8.390625 pence for the British exchange rate and 16.40625 yuan for the US exchange rate.

In the afternoon, a sudden surge in buying from Hong Kong via foreign telegraph, and the supply from foreign banks was not smooth, so the situation turned tight and soft. Hong Kong Telegraph purchased British exchange rates from HSBC and foreign banks at 8.34375 pence. Subsequently, a father purchased US exchange rates from a certain bank at 16.3125 yuan. After that, the market became quiet, with only slight Hong Kong exchange transactions. The various money changers forcefully sold Hong Kong exchange rates to foreign banks Huabi at 56.25 yuan, and the situation also turned soft. By the evening closing, the bank's selling price was 8.359375 pence for the British exchange rate and 16.34375 yuan for the US exchange rate. As a result, compared to the previous close, the British exchange rate eased by 0.015625 yuan, the US exchange rate tightened by 0.03125 yuan, and the Hong Kong exchange rate also declined by half a yuan.

Yesterday, the London pure gold rose by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate was unchanged. The foreign exchange market in this city took advantage of the overnight downward trend, and Western merchants Sassoon and others frequently sold. Tianjin Telegraph liquidated many positions. The supply from Hong Kong Telegraph was continuous. Market prices eased all the way, with no room for review. In the afternoon, Western merchants stopped selling, the supply from foreign telegraph became scarce, and foreign firms were suddenly busy closing accounts. Banks' willingness to sell faded, and market prices tightened. Sassoon, the cotton yarn dealers, and others came to replenish their positions, and sellers were scarce. The result was a very slight easing. The initial follow-up to the easing of exchange rates by spot gold led to a frantic sell-off by all parties, and the market price was extremely weak. However, gold dealers, money changers, and others still held bullish psychology, occasionally absorbing. Later, upon hearing that exchange rates were tightening, retail investors added to their positions even more fiercely, and Tianjin brokers stepped in to purchase, with a strong rebound. The result was still a decline. Foreign currencies were affected by the easing of exchange rates and the decline in spot gold. Wealthy individuals were still selling in large numbers. Money changers' absorption was not smooth, and market prices continued to decline. However, the downward trend turned moderate, and most currencies were stable and unchanged. The Australian gold note has rebounded, and the decline is observed to have stopped. Overall trading was not smooth. The association's transactions were extremely rare, with only Huitong selling to Changtai, purchasing British gold notes for 75 pounds. Yesterday's market prices: British pound down 4 jiao, British gold note down 0.05 yuan, US gold pound down 3 jiao, Hong Kong note down 0.01 yuan, French franc note down 0.5 yuan, Singapore note down 0.02 yuan, Canadian note down 0.04 yuan, Italian note down 0.01 yuan, and Australian gold note was the only one to rise by 0.1 yuan. The others were all unchanged.

Pure Gold Up Half a Penny; Customs Gold Unchanged

According to an 8th London telegram, British pure gold rose by half a penny per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 3 pence. As a result, the China cash purchase price of the Central Bank also rose to 1210.03 yuan. The listed customs gold was unchanged, remaining at 2.392 yuan. The Shanghai standard margin gold price also rose by 4 jiao, calculated at 1205.6 yuan.

### Sino-British Exchange Fund Loan

— Sheng Mujie

(1) From Goods Loans to Monetary Loans In mid-December 1938, the US Export-Import Bank granted China a credit line of US$25 million. At that time, the author commented on the economic significance of this loan, explaining that it was a goods loan and inferring that British loans to China would definitely materialize. As expected, after the amendment of the Export Credits Guarantee Act on December 15 last year, a loan of 500,000 pounds was granted to China, and it was also stipulated that several batches of commercial credit loans would be granted to China at the end of last year to purchase goods other than trains and munitions to develop the economic construction of the southwestern provinces. At that time, the British side argued that China's needs were very large, and if this meager sum of 500,000 pounds were distributed equally according to the Chinese population, each person could only get one Farthing—equal to one-quarter of a penny, which would not be of any benefit in reality; moreover, the British government not only failed to allow China to borrow softly, but also designated this meager sum for the purpose of purchasing heavy-duty vehicles and transportation materials, which was really not perfect. Although China received this 500,000 pounds when it established a US$25 million credit loan with the United States, it did not feel it was insufficient, and only hoped that Britain could provide stronger assistance in finance and monetary affairs. Therefore, only three months have passed from last year to now, and China and Britain have established a monetary loan of 5 million pounds.

(2) Establishment of Sino-British Monetary Loan

According to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir John Simon, who declared in the House of Commons on March 8, the establishment of this Sino-British monetary loan is a loan to China's foreign exchange stabilization fund, which is used to consolidate China's legal tender system. We can analyze the content, nature, and use of this loan decision based on Simon's reply to Councilor Lawrence's request to publish words to assist China in maintaining the stability of the true value of legal tender as follows:

Name: China Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Loan;

Amount: British commitment of 5 million pounds;

Purpose: To consolidate legal tender;

Lending Banks: HSBC and Chartered Bank;

Guarantee: If the fund suffers losses at the end, the British Treasury guarantees compensation; if it obtains profits, it will be transferred to the British Treasury:

Term: The term of use is limited to twelve months, which can be extended upon expiry, and can be terminated early if necessary.

Britain's plan to loan to China was considered by the cabinet in July last year. At that time, it was not approved due to insufficient reasons, and it was feared that it would be inconvenient to adopt an active plan in the Far East when the European crisis was progressing. However, the Japanese cut off commerce in North China, prohibited navigation on the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers under the pretext of military affairs, organized a Japanese yen group, excluded foreigners' interests in China, and even provoked Britain by bombing Kowloon and occupying Hainan Island, threatening Hong Kong, forcing Britain to take necessary measures to protect its interests in China. Therefore, in fact, Britain on the one hand granted China credit to purchase British goods, and on the other hand loaned funds to China to help it maintain the legal tender system. Now that the Spanish issue is about to end, Britain can concentrate its attention on the Far East issue and confront Japan economically. Then, this monetary loan is undoubtedly a diplomatic gesture, no less than a warning to Japan that although Britain does not want to use war to maintain the open door in China, it will never allow its interests in China to be eliminated due to the lack of practical assistance. Under this reason, the recent Sino-British monetary loan of 5 million pounds was established.

(3) New China's Wartime Financial Policy

Based on the previous analysis of this Sino-British loan, it can be known that this is the latest type of financial policy in China's wartime financial policy. According to the news revealed by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir John Simon, the Chinese government has notified the British government that it intends to continue the current monetary policy, and in addition to the legal tender reserve, it will also set up a foreign exchange stabilization fund of 10 million pounds to stabilize the legal tender as part of this policy. It is obvious that this foreign exchange stabilization fund policy is a new type of financial policy in China. According to China's implementation of the silver export equalization tax system in October 1934, in order to stabilize foreign exchange, the three government banks of the Central Bank of China Transportation raised a fund of 100 million yuan and handed it over to the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee for use. However, strengthening the use of this policy now is of course a new financial policy during wartime.

China's current monetary policy, from the point of view of maintaining the legal tender exchange rate, is nothing more than the control of foreign exchange, the collection of gold and silver, and the exploitation of gold sand. However, at present, taking the collection of gold and silver and the mining of gold sand as the only way to solve the foreign exchange problem is really too slow to solve the urgent need. Now that China naturally has a strong power to maintain the legal exchange rate of legal tender, in fact, the legal exchange rate of legal tender has always been stable after nearly 20 months of war, but the current foreign exchange control method is not said to be completely appropriate and without drawbacks (refer to Kong Xiangxi's speech at the 14th annual meeting of the China Economic Society in Chongqing). Therefore, it is now conceived from the foreign exchange stabilization fund in order to make the legal tender system more and more consolidated. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the British government sent economic adviser Sir Otto Niemeyer to vigorously assist China in stabilizing its currency and establishing the legal tender system. Could it be that after the Sino-Japanese War, it would be indifferent to the stabilization of legal tender, which is most important to British finance and economy? Now that China is making its best efforts to continue its current monetary policy and implement a new financial policy to establish a foreign exchange stabilization fund in order to stabilize the legal tender, it has a great relationship with Britain's trade in China, and Britain is happy to lend money to help the success of this new policy.

### Securities Domestic and Foreign Bonds Continue to Rise Sharply Railway Stocks Already Showing Discrepancies

The securities black market continued to soar yesterday. Types C and E have both broken through the 50 yuan mark. As predicted by this newspaper, this kind of rising trend has changed from slow to rapid and lasted for more than half a month. The market price has risen by about six yuan in total. The main reason is this major loan decision. However, the rapid rise of public bonds is bound to cause a reversal, because the buying power of many parties is gradually feeling satisfied. Yesterday, only No. 20 was strongly absorbing, and the rest were only sporadic purchases. The bulls are looking for an opportunity to sell, and this must also be guarded against.

Yesterday's process: At the beginning of the morning, type C immediately broke through the 50 yuan mark. Gan Hao vigorously absorbed a very large number. Yongkang and No. 5 followed. Although there were sales from Qiaofeng Tianxing and Runli, the price was very firm, so the market price rose straight up. Retail investors entered and exited frequently, and the market was even more lively. The market rose by six to eight cents in one session. Because type B held a lottery, the market price excluded the right to win the lottery, but it still rose by one and a half cents. In the afternoon, No. 20 continued to pull up, and Nos. 15 and 52 both had replenishment. Maoda Hao also had considerable buying power. Type E broke through the 50 yuan mark again. Type C saw 51 yuan and 4 cents. The highest price of type A also broke through 8 yuan. The sellers were Tongkang and Zhenkang selling. Lianhe and Hengfu also sold off. Nos. 11 and 35 all sold off, but the market price was still pulled up very firmly. The strength of the rising trend was only seen this year. In total, the market price rose sharply by 1 yuan and 1 cent to 1 yuan and 4 cents. Type B only rose by 7 and a half cents due to the lottery. The total number of transactions was more than 1.67 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:

The stock exchange or yarn cloth exchange stock of 50 shares was priced at 37 yuan and 5 cents.

London Chinese Foreign Currency Bonds On the 9th of this month (Thursday), the market price of various bonds continued to rise and the rising trend has not stopped. There was still an increase of half a pound to one and a half pounds. However, railway bonds showed discrepancies and the steps were not consistent. There was also a fluctuation of one pound. Vickers Aircraft Bonds rose sharply by one and a half pounds, priced at 16 pounds. The Sino-French US 5% public bonds with stamped bonds and the Qing Dynasty British-issued bonds continued to rise by one pound. The former was priced at 69 pounds, and the latter was priced at 52 pounds. Crisp Bonds continued to rise by half a pound, priced at 37 and a half pounds. Railway bonds: Daoging Railway Bonds rose by one pound, priced at 23 pounds. Longhai and Guangjiu Railway Bonds also rose angrily by one pound. The former was priced at 16 pounds, and the latter was priced at 21 pounds. However, the Jinghu and Jinpu Railway Bonds fell back by one pound. The former fell to 24 pounds, and the latter both returned to the original price of 16 pounds. London physical supply: There were 2,000 pounds of Qing Dynasty British-issued bonds, priced at 53 pounds, one pound higher than the market. There were 2,000 pounds of Sino-French US 5% public bonds with stamped bonds (i.e., US$10,000), priced at 69 and a half pounds, half a pound higher than the market. Vickers Aircraft Bonds were 500 pounds, priced at 16 pounds, all at the same price as the market. Jinghu Railway Bonds were 2,000 pounds, priced at 24 pounds, all at the same price as the market. Huguang Railway Bonds were 5,000 pounds of non-German issued bonds, priced at 24 pounds, one pound higher than the market.

London British East Asian Companies Stocks On the 9th of this month (Thursday), the market price also tracked Chinese foreign debt and sparked a rising trend. Chartered Bank shares rose by half a pound, priced at 9 and a half pounds. HSBC shares rose sharply by 4 pounds, with market prices of 91 pounds each. Kaiping Coal Mine unregistered shares continued to rise by one shilling, priced at 19 shillings. Craig Rubber shares rose by seven and a half pence, priced at 21 shillings and ten and a half pence.

### Yarn and Cotton Limited Freight Between China and India Indian Cotton Unable to be Shipped to Shanghai on Time US Cotton Industry Proposal Passed

Foreign cotton market price: New York's Smith proposal, which had been long awaited in Washington (as reported in this newspaper on February 16), was approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee, causing short sellers to violently cover their positions, and industry players also had huge transactions. As a result, the cotton market rose sharply by 13 to 4 pound notes. India, including forecasts, rose by one and a half rupees. Egypt fell by more than 20 pound notes. It was still loose yesterday. Converted into legal tender, US cotton rose slightly by six cents, Indian cotton rose by four cents, and Egypt fell by more than three cents.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Indian cotton was sold too much, and the shipments to the Far East were very crowded. The freight between China and India that can be assigned to cotton transporters is limited. As a result, Indian cotton is fully stocked in the Indian wharf warehouses, and the Shanghai factories have purchased cotton due to needs, and it has already been used as a credit. Due to the fact that Indian cotton cannot be shipped on time, all are deeply worried, fearing that the raw cotton will be interrupted. Temporary observation of the handling of Indian cotton, so the foreign cotton transaction turned quiet. Yesterday, Xinyu imported 1,000 bales of US cotton, priced at 75 yuan and 5 cents. No other factory has any transactions. The cotton prices yesterday are listed below:

Native cotton business is still quiet, because the goods are too scarce, the price is difficult to loosen, and the foreign exchange conversion price is cheap, and the exchange draft is prolonged endlessly. The factory of course chooses the cheap over the expensive, so the foreign cotton business is unusually lively, and the native cotton transactions are very few. 180 bales of Xiasahua arrived at the dock, and 1,080 bales of Yaohua also arrived. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left:

### Cotton Yarn Hoarders Buy and Sell to Each Other It is Not Easy to Sell 20-Count Double Horse Japanese Yarn Fell Sharply and There is Even More Lack of Acceptance

The yarn market turned weak. The reason is that our army in Hubei Province strongly resisted, and the Japanese planes bombed even more fiercely. People's minds were slightly delayed in purchasing, and transactions were therefore lacking. At the same time, the general hoarding of goods was very thick, so the daily market transactions were all mutual buying and selling. Actual transactions basically did not move, and the market did not get rid of the wandering path. However, because 32-count and 42-count yarns were produced less, and merchants hoarded goods and were willing to sell, the market outlook was still stable.

The current yarn business was not moving at the beginning of the morning. Although people's minds were bullish, they held the good goods in their hands and waited for the price to rise and sell them. Therefore, the opening price of 20-count Bianma yarn was 399 yuan, down 1 yuan and 5 cents. There were no major ups and downs after that. It rose slightly in the middle, but soon returned. The lowest price was 398 yuan, and the dock receipt was 396 yuan. Due to the rain in the afternoon, the transaction was even more weak. 20-count Shuangma 398 yuan was not easy to sell. The dock receipt price was 395 yuan. As a result, the entire day's transaction was only 805 bales. The market price of 20-count Bianma Tiannu was the same as the remaining 10-count coarse yarn and 32-count 42 moves. Today, 255 pieces of yarn were shipped to Tianjin, and 42 pieces were shipped to Yantai. Yesterday, 2,500 pieces of yarn came from Tianjin. The amount bought by each bank is recorded on the left:

In the Japanese yarn market, the falling trend suddenly started. It is said that the war in the Subei area is fierce, the sales channel is blocked, people's minds are panic, and the market price has fallen sharply. However, large households are still in a bullish position. The current yarn price of 20-count Shuiyue is 334 yuan to 32 yuan. The current yarn price of 20-count Lanfeng is 328 yuan, suddenly falling to 324 yuan, and there are very few acceptors.

Piece Goods Summer Goods Should Sell Well Eastern Piece Goods Are Weak Due to Rumors of Tianjin Exchange Suspension Woolen Fabrics Show a Rush

Domestic cloth bleached mercerized light-colored piece goods: Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Shantou banks continue to purchase vigorously. However, dark-colored cotton cloths are restricted by the season. Remote customers and local streets only have a little embellishment. The prices offered by various factories are also relatively cheap. Wen Yonggang handled more than 200 bales of coarse cloth from factories such as Yih Da and Dasheng, and nearly 100 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill from various brands such as Cannon Cart, Dapeng, and Three Rabbits. Guangdong banks handled 50 or 60 bales of fine twill and fine cloth. Fine yarn fabrics are most in demand on local streets. Yefu silk, which is about one yuan per yard for upper body goods, foreign yarn above 16 or 7 yuan, and bleached cloth are vigorously searched for. The prices of printed hemp yarn from Lun Chang Factory are all above 14 yuan. The prices of non-fading flower cloths of various grades are all above 11 yuan. Summer sales have been good in this city for many years, so the local street wholesale shops have advanced hundreds of boxes of inventory from the factories early, because the new goods will definitely be expensive when they are launched. High-end foreign yarn is more popular. Even local streets, Sichuan, Shantou, and Yong banks have added to their purchases. However, the demand for mid-to-low-end goods is more sluggish. The Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Shantou banks and local street wholesale shops have smooth transactions for low-end Qingshui bleached cloth, totaling more than 200 boxes yesterday, priced at about 11 or 12 yuan and 5 cents.

Eastern Piece Goods White Goods Fine Cloth Fine Twill Was Soft Yesterday Because There Were Rumors of Tianjin Exchange Suspension Hand Goods Were Resold Market Dumpers Seized the Opportunity The More Sellers of 12-Pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth Were The Most Falling One Time Dumped to 11 Yuan and 8 Cents But Soon Rose Back 8 and a Half Cents Which Was Another 1 Cent Lower Than the Previous Day's Sales Plate While Other Rainbow Ball and Flying Fish Only Had a Fluctuation of 5 Cents In the Aftermarket Local Street Industry Took Advantage of Cheap Purchases and Transacted More Than 700 Pieces of Fine Cloth and Fine Twill of Various Brands Therefore When the Market Closed People's Spirits Turned Firm Again

### Silk and Tea Japanese Silk Enters the 1,000 Yuan Mark Silk Prices Expected to Fall

In the foreign silk market, since the Japanese authorities ordered the crackdown on speculation last Sunday, the silk prices in the eastern market have been trending downstream. Yokohama spot fell to 1,000 yuan yesterday, opening at 995 yuan, and opening at 985 yuan in the afternoon, a drop of 20 yuan. The forward opened at 967 yuan and closed at 928 yuan in the afternoon, a decrease of 39 yuan compared to the previous day. Therefore, the trend of the silk market has fundamentally changed. It is predicted that ports such as New York will follow suit and shrink. Yesterday, spot silk in New York, Shanghai silk, each fell by one to three points. Lyon Shanghai silk fell by half a franc.

The local silk market was quite quiet yesterday. Export sales fell by one because Yokohama reported a fall, and the success of the Sino-British loan lengthened the exchange rate, which made the distance between domestic and foreign market prices farther. The price of White Factory B was 1,800 yuan, which has fallen by 150 yuan compared to the peak. However, the foreign firm's eating price still needs to be reduced by more than 50 yuan. The domestic market's sentiment turned weak, and all turned from waiting and watching to expecting a fall, so the intention to enter was very weak, and transactions were few. Yesterday, only six loads were opened.

### Oil Cakes Speculation Controls Raw Oil Actual Delivery Hesitant Soybean Oil is Also Just a Game of Football

Recently, the oil market situation has completely changed into exchange trading, resulting in hesitation in actual sales. The entire transaction is controlled by speculators. Yesterday, the market situation of raw soybean oil generally rose after being flat in the front. Due to the soaring price of blue peanut oil by 4 yuan the day before yesterday, the foreign yards in the market were frequently short, resulting in small buyers taking cautious steps. Moreover, because the Qingdao control procedures have not yet been clearly announced, the potential trend is hovering. It is estimated that 120 pieces of Jiaozhou oil and 600 cans of Yantai canned oil were opened. The market sentiment of soybean oil was also resting on the Japanese side. There was only a game of football on the market. It is estimated that 70 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were delivered at the end of March, priced at 30 yuan, 4 cents and a half, 200 barrels in the lower part of March, priced at 30 yuan, 4 cents and a half, and 3 cents, and 400 barrels in April, priced at 30 yuan, 2 cents to 5 and a half cents.

Yesterday, 480 pieces of imported goods arrived, soybean oil came from Yantai, and 150 pieces of Peiyou came from Ningbo. Today, 1,200 barrels of machine oil are exported to Tianjin.

### Grain Japonica and Indica Rice Have Both Reached the Price Limit Bian Yuan Opened at 19 Yuan and 4 Cents Foreign Wheat Continues to Arrive and Local Wheat is Stagnant

Dumi River has arrived at No. 5, and more than 2,000 bags of steamed buns have been transported by car. Since the price limit, high-priced goods have disappeared from the market. Both buyers and sellers only exchange medium-priced goods, and the opening prices are all at the price limit line of 14 yuan, except for the He Xia goods. The highest price of Bian Yuan has opened at 19 yuan and 4 cents, which is more than 5 or 6 cents higher than the previous market.

There were 6,000 to 7,000 bags of Hakka Indica rice transactions. The market price increased by 3 or 4 cents. However, the market strictly limited the price and decided that the highest price limit for Hakka Indica rice was 13 yuan and a half. It was only adjusted by returning bags and handling the goods in the middle. In terms of the quality of the goods, the highest Hakka Indica rice should reach 14 yuan. Check the rice grain import and export. Today, 3,400 bags of rice were transferred from the port to Tianjin.

Because the price of rice rose and the current flour was insufficient, the local street wholesale price of flour still needed 4 yuan and 7 cents and 5 cents. The customer plate was slightly different, so the flour price continued to have three market prices. The Tong Market was jointly organized by the North and South banks. The No. 2 flour car boat, Tianzhu, Fisherman, and other brands totaled more than 50,000 bags, priced at 4 yuan, 7 cents, and 4 yuan, 6 cents and a half. The combined price of high-brand foreign flour continued to be equal to that of local flour. Futures were cheaper than local flour. Check that 8,000 bags of flour were shipped to Yantai today, and 1,000 bags came from Hong Kong and were transferred to Tianjin. However, the sales of local wheat were still sluggish.

Foreign wheat arrived one after another. The German ship Gantzee Fritzen, which transported wheat from Australia to Shanghai last time, lacked coal and went to Yokohama to load coal. Later, the machinery suddenly suffered damage, which caused the delay to Shanghai. Yesterday, according to the agent of the ship, the ship has now been repaired and left Yokohama yesterday. It is expected to arrive at the port on the 15th. Now there is another Rothley, which is loaded with 8,818 tons of wheat from Australia and is already on its way. It is scheduled to be moored at various docks and floating pontoons on the Xingqi River. There is no space, so it is first anchored outside the port. When the dock or pontoon is empty, it will enter the port and unload. (Zu)

### Sugar Market Dutch Coarse White Thrown Price Continues to Rise

Yesterday, the sugar market gradually stabilized. The guild allocated 24 Dutch coarse white discs. The transfer cargo called 16 yuan and 7 cents. The spot goods were not moving. Taikoo Sugar B Mark traded dozens of bags at 24 yuan, 3 cents, 7 points and a half. Because the production price of Dutch coarse white continued to rise by 2 cents, it recently threw over 9 yuan and 5 cents. Yesterday, it was called 5 yuan, 1 cent and a half. The Chao Bank of Chinese Sugar opened more than 100 bags of Mianbai, Shangbingbai was 24 yuan and 2 cents to 24 yuan. It was decided to be 23 yuan and 7 cents. Chaoqing Shangtizhuang was 15 yuan, 4 and 5 cents, and Shanghuanggang was 15 yuan and 2 cents, totaling more than 200 bags. Longgang Qing was 136 bags, 13 yuan and 5 cents. Shan Chi was more than 400 bags, 15 yuan and a half, and the second one was 15 yuan, 3 cents to 15 yuan. The Min Bank opened 120 bags of Dagongfen, 23 yuan, and more than 40 bags of miscellaneous sub-whites, 19 yuan. Because the arrival of Diaoging increased slightly, although the bid was scored, there was no chance to trade.

### Medicinal Materials New Citrus Fruit Sales Turn Active

New citrus fruit is also named Paoken, (ie raw material for small green peel). In the winter, sales were mediocre, and the middle Zhuang only sold 8 yuan per load. Until recently, the removal turned active. The day before yesterday, a certain number sold 60 to 70 pieces of the same one, and the price was 11 yuan, which was completely sold. Now there is another batch, which has been called 14 yuan. It is found that the accumulation in the producing area is gradually thinning, and there is a rising trend.

### Maintaining Discipline

— Mao Lie

I really don't know how many heartless and sick people, acting like ghosts, are taking advantage of the chaos of war to do things that are harmful to nature and reason! Not long ago, we saw the case of the Hu bandits, father and son, killing their mother and forcibly marrying their daughter. Recently, we saw the case of the director of a refugee camp beating a refugee to death. These two cases are currently being tried. We cannot prejudge or interfere with the future judgments. There will be fair laws in place. But we cannot but express our loyalty to uphold the law and maintain discipline. We hope that the main culprits in these two cases will receive their due punishment; and during this national crisis, their actions are even more unforgivable. Therefore, we especially hope that our judges will "increase the punishment."

However, these are all obvious criminal cases. The law is easy to impose sentences, and society is easy to distinguish clearly and know that the crimes deserve their due punishment. Only one word is subtle, and the law has no explicit provisions, so it cannot be said that he is guilty. A line of detail is that society regards it as a bad habit and often tolerates it. Such people have gained extra-legal freedom and a paradise in corruption. This is very harmful to the world's morality, people's hearts, the country, and the nation. We should not let them go lightly.

A certain lawyer actually called stolen goods "spoils of war." What is this! Perhaps his words do not violate the law, but he admits that the things looted by the enemy are "spoils of war" and argues that those who buy these "spoils of war" from the enemy "do not constitute the crime of receiving stolen goods." May I ask which country's people do he and the parties he represents consider themselves to be! If everyone recognizes and argues like that lawyer and deals with our enemies, what resistance war do we need? Isn't it just to cooperate with them! Therefore, we must also shout out the slogan of "Maintaining Discipline" and denounce it!

The notice issued by the President of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and the President of the Shanghai Second Special District Court, "prohibiting clerks from soliciting money from litigants," is doing what should be done on the positive side of "Maintaining Discipline," then we should sing the praises of our wise officials.

"People must insult themselves before others insult them." During this period when the whole country is united and strengthening the power of resistance, we must of course uphold our national laws, and we must especially maintain the social discipline that the law cannot reach!

### Spanish Refugee School

— Yun Translation

In a monastery with a garden, there is a refugee school. Inside, seventy children, struggling with hunger, are studying. These children have all escaped from bombed areas. There is a female teacher teaching them. They don't have a single piece of paper, a needle, or a piece of chalk.

A soldier past his draft age serves in the school, and two wounded young men also volunteer to teach under the teacher's direction. They are all like older brothers to the children. Some children, like many soldiers, have become disabled.

The teacher does not have the power of punishment or reward; this is handled by a student council organized by the children themselves.

Every Sunday afternoon, the hospital sends a driver in a car to take them there for baths and haircuts. This is a day of exceptional joy for them, and they often sing triumphant anti-fascist songs.

On Monday afternoons, a doctor and a nurse come to their school to give them a thorough physical examination. Large tables are set up in the room, and medical record cards are prepared for each child. A representative sorts the cards and lines up the children in the hallway. Another helps the children undress. The doctor calls out things like, "Teeth need treatment," "Elbow joint pain," etc., while the nurse records them on the cards. Another health representative listens nearby and records the doctor's words to report to the children's parents, so that the parents can properly care for the children.

When they get some paper, they write short articles and post them on the walls of the hallway as a bulletin board. The compositions are all spontaneous. The writing is done in red ink because they have nothing else to use. As soon as they entered the monastery, they started raising rabbits, raising chicks, and gardening. The teacher also makes diagrams to teach the girls how to sew clothes and the boys how to do carpentry. Although they still lack many things, such as needles, spinning wheels, and hammers, children elsewhere will help them and send them pencils, paper, colored chalk, tools, cloth, balls, and everything else that children love.

The students' lunch is provided by the school. Each child receives a cup of cocoa and a piece of bread per meal. The expenses are donated by the hospital staff and wounded soldiers. (Translated from "New Masses")

### The Emergence of New Realist Literature

— Qin Wen

In literature, works of new realism emerged after works of new idealism. The advantage of the original realist school lies in its ability to write nakedly, realistically, vividly, and thoroughly, in accordance with reason and logic, which is why it is deeply moving and powerful. Because the romantic school before the realist school, starting from ideals, fell into fantasy, and passion flowed into delusion, becoming broad, superficial, and weak, it was overwhelmed by the realist school. —The romantic school's attitude was close to playfulness, and it could not satisfy the desires of serious readers, which is why the solemn and rigorous realist school arose. From this, it can be seen that realism is better than relying on ideals in deeply exploring problems and carefully studying the use of life. However, the realist school focuses on the reproduction of facts, which inevitably leads to restraint; when society is extremely chaotic, there are too many ugly things, and revolutionary means are needed to rapidly improve the situation, it is not enough to rely on the realist school to expose the inherent bad phenomena in a satirical way as an attack on the dark side, treating a headache when it hurts, and treating a foot pain when it hurts, to save the entire society with serious illnesses. Moreover, later naturalists neglected the bright side and always focused on the description of the dark side, and too many sad hints inevitably made people feel depressed. Readers in a dim environment are already depressed enough, and it is even more depressing to see dim works, feeling hopeless and disappointed.

The remedy is to focus on the description of the bright side, to make people optimistic, to actively represent exemplary figures who are active and capable, and to encourage them, so that after readers understand what they should do, they will naturally and unconsciously put it into practice, thereby fundamentally transforming the bad environment. Such active and capable exemplary figures do not have ready-made models available in the existing facts, so the author has to fabricate them, which is the characteristic of new idealism. For example, in the past, there were no figures who could effectively resist the aggression and ruthless oppression of the Japanese invaders that could be used as ready-made models; but resistance must be prepared, and resistance must be advocated in literature, so the so-called nationalist literature at that time was a propaganda tool to prepare for resistance, and in addition to using stories of ancient national heroes to inspire, it had to adopt the means of new idealism to fabricate exemplary figures. From this, it can be seen that the fabrication of characters is a necessary thing in non-aesthetic life literature; if there are ready-made models available, it is not only easier, but also more realistic and easier to move people.

Now it's great, for more than a year and a half since the official start of the War of Resistance, in the fierce struggle of national revolution, many loyal and brave soldiers who charged forward in the front, bathed in blood and fought the enemy, are models for the youth in the rear. The stories of generous and passionate martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the country are good materials to encourage future generations. Moreover, the activities of the guerrillas who struggle hard everywhere, and the various experiences of their victories and failures, can all be used as reference materials for the general public, as their role models, inspiring them to participate in the war, or to prepare practically to prevent enemy invasion. These facts, although they are already past, are ideal things that people who have not been involved in them are eager to obtain. To adopt themes from ideals is nothing more than because the existing facts are not enough; with so many vivid facts, why not use them?

Works that record these new facts are new realist works; although they are "reproductions," they have the same "expression" function as general new idealist works. Not only can it be used as an exemplary propaganda tool among the majority of people in our country, but it can also be promoted to various oppressed and weak nations for active use. Because these facts are all exemplary acts of unity, struggle, resistance to the strong, and self-defense.

The so-called new realist literature is not new in the writing method, but new in the nature of the theme. Moreover, this "new" is not just "recent," but focuses on resisting tyranny and supporting the weak, and jointly maintaining justice and humanity. New realist works were rarely seen before, except for Soviet literature, because such facts were only abundant in the Great Revolution in the Soviet Union. Later, we can also have many new realist literature, although the nature is slightly different, but the function of realism that can demonstrate and inspire is the same. Whether it is the firm and resilient spirit in "The Iron Flood," or the spirit of not being afraid of sacrifice in "The Rout" and "The Forty-First," we have it all. Not to mention the experience of fighting hard for ten years and marching ten thousand miles; the facts of the Eight Hundred Heroes and the Lushan Lone Army fighting in distress, as well as the selfless heroic deeds of loyal and brave soldiers on various battlefields, can all be written into moving masterpieces.

The large number of new realist literature appearing in our country will become a by-product of the War of Resistance Against Japan.

### In the Rear (Part 2)

— Wu Yi

Two

A nurse leads the way, and a group of children bounces in, chattering and laughing. They are the children's choir from a nearby elementary school. They come every day to sing a few songs to relieve our boredom.

After singing three group songs, (1) Party Song; (2) Salute to the Warriors; (3) Long Live China. Miss Peng, as usual, holding the medicine tray in one hand and the child named Jiji in the other, walks over to our side.

I say, "Jiji, come and sing a nice song for old Niu."

So Jiji runs over familiarly, leans his little body on my bed rail, and sings:

Tell your mother not to grieve, not to grieve,

When we win,

We will return to our hometown in triumph——

"Jiji, don't you know how to dance? The old folks will love you if you dance, they will catch the ×× Japanese devils for you. Dance again, be good." Miss Peng says with a smile.

Jiji is really good. He rolls his little black eyes, then raises his little voice and continues to sing:

"Rush over, …snatch over, don't look back, don't linger…"

While thrusting his white, chubby little fist forward again and again. We all forget the pain and turn over to laugh. Miss Peng claps her hands and says Jiji dances well! I also say:

"Good! Don't look back, don't linger…"

But Jiji climbs on my bedside and says that he can sing a song that no one else can sing. Miss Peng asks him to sing, but Jiji refuses. I ask Miss Peng to take out an empty bullet casing from my pocket and give it to him. Only then does a dimple appear on Jiji's red face, and he sings:

Fight ××, fight ××,

Take back Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang,

Drive the ×× one by one into the Pacific Ocean.

Jiji, remember, Jilin is our country, our hometown

"Jiji, who taught you this song?" I ask as if I have a strange feeling.

"Daddy taught it, Mommy wanted me to memorize it." Jiji says.

"What does your daddy do?" I ask very kindly, reaching out my good hand to pull Jiji.

"Um," unexpectedly, Jiji raises his little head and reveals a puzzled look; but then he says: "Mommy told me that Daddy went home because no one was taking care of the house and bandits were going to rob things." He also says, "Daddy is like old Niu, I remember Daddy also has a big scar on his face."

Really, Jiji loves to play with the old bruises on my face, and Miss Peng is always anxious because she is afraid of hurting my wound. I say:

"Jiji, I also have a big boy at home, just like you, white and chubby. He also hides a lot of bullet casings that I brought back for him."

So Jiji says to me very affectionately:

"Dad also kept bullet casings for me. When we defeat the dwarfs, you bring him over to compare with me, and we'll make friends, and I'll call Dad back to be an old friend for you." He also tells me not to forget.

Amidst the suppressed groans of laughter from the old folks, Miss Peng takes Jiji back to his team. After that, every time Jiji comes, he always mentions making friends with the dwarf and Xiao Niu, and also tells me: he has already learned "shoulder arms" and "order arms." And asks if Xiao Niu knows them, and if he does, in the future, we can join the army together to fight the dwarfs, and we can抢(qiang, lit: grab, but implied to "get a hold of") a real foreign gun like everyone else.

### Amidst the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

However, the people in Hupuzhen, who were accustomed to a comfortable life, did not take it seriously. Moreover, Tu Dong, Yang Yue, and Liang were secretly undermining them, saying that Regiment Commander Ye was intentionally exaggerating to scare them, and that his purpose was just to use this topic to solicit money from the people in the town, so the people did not take Regiment Commander Ye's words to heart even more. Regiment Commander Ye saw that those who spoke earnestly were ignored, and he could only sigh silently. He had already controlled all the ships on the shore of Taihu Lake, but at this time, he hired a civilian boat to move food and some household items onto the boat. When Old Mr. Ye asked him what this meant, he said with a sigh:

"People are not good for a thousand days, and flowers are not red for a hundred days. I can't say that I will always be able to protect this hometown. If the situation is critical, and my parents are already old, they can't endure the suffering of retreating with the army, so I can only ask you to take refuge in Taihu Lake for a while. There are our guerrilla teams in the East and West Dongting Mountains and Maji Mountain in Taihu Lake. Going there, there will always be some small care."

Old Mr. Ye did not quite understand the situation outside. He even felt that Regiment Commander Ye's actions were a bit too neurotic.

However, the facts proved that Regiment Commander Ye's actions were prophetic. Time quickly arrived at the Lunar New Year, and the people in Hupuzhen were celebrating wildly because each store had a surplus at the end of the year, so everyone voluntarily pooled money to build a solid stage in the Baoen Temple in the town, and hired a traveling performing troupe to perform a grand opera for five days and five nights to thank the gods. On the third day of the New Year. Just when everyone was watching the opera with great concentration in the Baoen Temple, shoulder to shoulder and back to back, suddenly, the air raid alarm bell on the observation tower began to ring wildly, "Dang dang."

However, the sound of the alarm was drowned out by the sound of the New Year gongs and drums from each household, and the sound of the big gongs and drums on the stage. Regiment Commander Ye was more attentive after all. When he heard the bell, he knew that something was wrong, and when he heard the sound of the gongs and drums on the stage still ringing loudly, he hurriedly took the megaphone himself to disperse the people in Baoen Temple.

The opera "Baishuitan" was being performed on the stage, with Shi Yi Lang fighting Qingmianhu, and the gongs and drums were pounding loudly, and the audience under the stage were cheering loudly, completely unaware that danger was approaching. Regiment Commander Ye squeezed through the crowd for a long time, and finally managed to squeeze to the front of the stage. He hurriedly shouted to stop the gongs on the stage, jumped onto the stage, and held the megaphone to say to everyone:

"Enemy planes are coming! Everyone go home and hide in the air raid shelter." (30)

### Starting from the Price Increase of Public Utilities

— Zhang Zhenshan

Hoping that the public utility authorities adopt fewer passive remedial measures, hoping that the bosses hoarding daily necessities can weigh the pros and cons, and hoping that people who cannot maintain their livelihoods go to the interior as much as possible

In recent years, Shanghai's public utilities seem to be living in a recession amidst prosperity; tap water and electricity have both successively increased in price due to unbalanced revenues and expenditures. The power company also implemented a 10% increase from this month, which was a gradual increase among the 32.5% increase previously requested. Amidst this wave of increases, the Municipal Council's municipal general tax, land tax, etc. also followed suit, increasing by 2%.

In reality, the income of various businesses has been better than in the past due to the concentration of population and increased consumption in the concession; however, what are the reasons and justifications for the price increase of various public utilities? To sum it up in one sentence: "Tightening of foreign exchange." Because Shanghai's public utilities in various departments are operated by Westerners, and most of the raw materials they use are transported from abroad, and most of the middle and upper-level employees they hire are also Westerners. At present, the cost of materials transported from abroad is high, and the salaries earned by Western employees and remitted back to their hometowns have been reduced by a certain amount compared to normal times. In order to stabilize the lives of employees, the authorities have created "exchange subsidies" and "cost of living subsidies." Under these circumstances, its own expenditures naturally exceed income, and it needs to increase prices to make up for it.

However, the price increase of public utilities is not the same as the price increase of goods. The impact it gives to society is to raise the overall standard of living in the city, making it impossible for various departments such as industry and commerce to maintain the original price due to huge expenditures. In recent months, the price of imported goods has indeed risen a lot, and the price of domestic goods has also risen again and again. Daily necessities rise, and non-daily necessities also rise. The newly purchased raw materials or goods rise, and the raw materials or goods stockpiled several years ago also rise: coupled with manipulation, hoarding, speculation, and other abnormal states and methods, so that in addition to "rising," there is also a "shortage." The bosses who hoard goods are all smiling, and last year became a prosperous year for the industrial and commercial circles, and part of the reason lies in this.

However, from the perspective of the internal situation of the lives of ordinary citizens, the price increase of non-essential high-priced imported goods and luxury goods does not have a very serious impact on the lives of most citizens, because non-daily essential imported goods do not hinder life; only after the price of daily essential things rises, the pressure given to citizens is really deep and huge! Although the clothing, food, and housing in the three items of clothing, food, and housing are flexible in terms of quality, they must always be maintained to the degree of warmth and satiety in terms of quantity. Tightening the belt to live is, after all, a joke. However, now the price of coarse cloth is higher than the price of fine cloth in the past, and vegetables have also increased by an unknown number of times compared to the past (the price of rice has also soared in recent days), not to mention chicken, duck, fish, meat, silk, and rent, etc.

The standard of living has gradually risen, but the income of ordinary small citizens and salaried classes has been just the opposite. What we hear is "layoffs and salary cuts" in the east and "leave of absence" in the west; those who served in the war zone in the past and are now trapped in the circle of unemployment are really countless, living in a state where production and consumption go against each other.

Recently, it was reported in the newspaper that our government is currently in consultation with HSBC Bank to crack down on the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai. We naturally look forward to its success, and at the same time, we also hope that the public utility authorities adopt fewer passive remedial measures, and hope that the bosses who hoard daily necessities weigh the pros and cons, and stop at the right time, and do not just have a distorted idea of "making more money" in their minds, then the lives of the general public will not be affected by fluctuations.

In addition, we also hope that people who cannot maintain the minimum standard of living go to the interior as much as possible to seek a living, because the prices of everything in the interior are regular, unlike Shanghai, which is so unrestricted; as long as you are determined to wear and use local products, you will not live in a daze and fear rising prices every day.

Scene Three

(The leader and four henchmen escort Dan onstage, Dan cries. Xiao Sheng Heng comes onstage, looks at Dan, speaks to the leader, says) Hey, you bold slaves, how dare you rob women from the people? (The leader whispers) I originally wanted to dedicate her to King Fan. Who knew that Fan Xizhou this kid wanted to get a piece of the action! Okay, let him take this advantage, it can be considered a personal favor! (Says to Xiao Sheng) I say, Master Fan, since you like her, I'll give her to you. (Xiao Sheng) Nonsense! Hurry up and retreat! (The leader) Yes! It is truly: Wasted my life fighting with swords, carrying water with a bamboo basket, all for naught. (The leader and henchmen all leave) (Xiao Sheng) I will personally untie her! (Dan turns her back to the right and ignores him) Young lady, you've been frightened! Xiao Sheng greets you here! (Xiao Sheng goes to the right and bows, Dan turns her back to the left again) Miss,喏喏喏, Xiao Sheng greets you here too! (Dan) Kill me if you want, no need for more words. (Xiao Sheng) Miss, allow Xiao Sheng to say a word. (Dan) Who would talk to you, a bandit! (Xiao Sheng) I, Xiao Sheng, am not willing to be a bandit…… (Dan) Hmph, now that the Jin are invading the south, the country is in a time of crisis. Since you are not willing to be a bandit, you should surrender to the Song Dynasty, work together to resist foreign aggression. Fine words and pretty phrases, who would believe you. I hate it so! (Sings) Now that the country is at war with foreign enemies, how can we bear internal worries; although you are not a Jin dog, you are actually helping the Jin chief. The country is harmed by your hands, still uttering flowery words. Saying you are not willing to be a bandit, not even a three-year-old child would fall for it. (Xiao Sheng) Miss! Miss, calm down, listen to me! (Sings) It's all because of the famine, the people fled; therefore, my uncle gathered people in the mountains. My family was forced to follow, all surnamed Fan, determined to escape the net, harder than hard. I will also use great righteousness to encourage him; acting as bandits, harming the people, committing all kinds of evil; it is better to wash your hands, disperse the henchmen; surrender to the Song Dynasty to resist foreign aggression, and vow to sweep away the stench. (Dan turns around, lowers her head towards Xiao Sheng) If that's the case, you haven't lost your conscience. (Raises her neck, looking at Xiao Sheng very heroic, with an expression of admiration and joy) You want to persuade Fan Ruwei to surrender to the Song Dynasty, if he doesn't listen, what will you do…? (Xiao Sheng) Then I…… (Dan waits for his reply) um… (Xiao Sheng) Then I…… there's nothing I can do! (Dan) Alas, in my opinion, if he doesn't listen, you should take the opportunity with your confidant generals to escape and join Yue Fei's army to attack the Jin! (Xiao Sheng) I'm afraid that won't work! (Dan) What won't work? (Xiao Sheng) If I'm caught by King Fan, wouldn't there be a risk to my life? (Dan) Then there's no need to say anything, I'll know you for who you are! (Dan turns her head slightly, angry) (Xiao Sheng) Wait, wait, but you must be discreet, or you may be lucky enough to escape. (Dan turns around towards Xiao Sheng) That is true. As a person, one must do what is right, and life and death can be put aside. Those who are not afraid of death will not necessarily die, the more you are afraid of death, the more you cannot escape! (Xiao Sheng) Miss's words have enlightened me. I will definitely plan and act, and live up to your expectations. (Dan raises her head towards Xiao Sheng, grasping his sleeve in gratitude) Is this true? (Xiao Sheng) It's true. (Dan) Really? (Xiao Sheng) Really. (Dan) Then accept my bow! Xiao Sheng helps her up) You mustn't, you mustn't! (Dan) I'm not bowing to you, I'm bowing to the fact that our country has another loyal and devoted man, the Great Song Dynasty is saved! (Xiao Sheng) I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed! Miss, please sit! (Dan) Have a seat, please sit! (Xiao Sheng) Have a seat! Xiao Sheng and Miss met by chance, it's truly a blessing in three lifetimes. It seems that Miss is a daughter of an official family, may I ask your name? (Dan) My surname is Feng, my given name is Yumei. Passing through Jianzhou with my father, I didn't expect to be forcibly taken here by bandits, I don't know when I'll see my father again, hehehe! (Cries) (Xiao Sheng) Miss, there's no need to cry. Xiao Sheng Fan Xizhou is also from a scholarly family, I haven't achieved fame yet, I'm staying here temporarily. I didn't expect to meet Miss, it can be said to be a match made in heaven. If you don't dislike me, I'm willing to be together, I'll slowly find your father. (Dan whispers) Things have come to this, it seems that this person is also a kind person, young and handsome, forced to be here; moreover, he has great ambitions to serve the country, it's better to follow him, so that I can encourage him at any time, and I won't waste my Feng Yumei's patriotic heart! (Says to Xiao Sheng) I am lucky to be alive, I will rely on you to protect me. (Xiao Sheng) Since you agree, I am overjoyed! Xiao Sheng has an ancestral treasure mirror, which is a mirror that opens and closes, clear and bright, with two characters, "鸳鸯" (Yuanyang, Mandarin Duck, a symbol of lovers), cast in it, called the Yuanyang Treasure Mirror. I'll cut off one side and give the other side to Miss as a betrothal gift. (Takes out the mirror and gives it to her, Dan accepts the mirror) Let's go home. Truly: We met by chance like old friends, (Dan) The Mandarin Duck together. (Xiao Sheng) If I can fulfill my lifelong wish, I'll kill the barbarian with ten thousand knives! (Together they leave)

### Night University

— Simon

Wealthy families have the financial means to send their children to university, even abroad to study, returning with a gilded reputation. However, these children often lack ambition, using studying as a facade for idleness, failing to even obtain a high school diploma. On the other hand, children from poor families are often intelligent and ambitious, eager to graduate from university, but their families' financial resources are insufficient, forcing them to drop out midway. At best, they graduate from high school and must leave school to find work. This seems to have become a set formula, making one feel the unfairness of creation and question why humanity must have rich and poor.

A young person, due to circumstances, cannot receive an ideal education. Once they leave school and enter society, they often encounter difficulties in handling matters due to insufficient knowledge. Sometimes, due to qualifications, they perform the same work but have a lower status and receive less pay than others. The pain and resentment felt when encountering such situations are unknown to those who have not experienced them.

Any ambitious young person in such an environment, driven by determination, can only resolve to improve their education by studying in their spare time. However, most tutoring schools are at the secondary level. Many working young people already have a secondary education and wish to study in the evenings while working during the day. They often find that tutoring schools lack university-level subjects, and despite their ambition, they have nowhere to study.

Indeed, all universities originally held classes during the day. However, perhaps educators have also recognized the frustration of working young people feeling inadequate in their academic abilities and having nowhere to study. In the city of Shanghai, there are several universities that offer classes at night, which is what this article refers to as night universities. This allows you to serve society while simultaneously seeking progress, using your spare time to work during the day and study at night.

Speaking of night universities, the oldest and most established in Shanghai is probably Soochow University. However, Soochow only offers law courses, and the qualifications are very strict, requiring a university preparatory school diploma to be eligible for the entrance exam. After graduation, the qualifications are exactly the same as those for daytime university students. Due to the qualification requirements, many working young people who have graduated from secondary schools may sigh in despair, unable to apply. However, historically, Soochow's night university has provided a great opportunity for many working young people who had attended university but dropped out midway and entered society. Over the years, Soochow has indeed produced many great lawyers.

Following Soochow, Chih Tze Law School, Shanghai Law College, and Political Science College also offered evening classes, naturally producing many legal talents. In addition to law, the National School of Commerce once offered evening classes, but later, due to the Ministry of Education's revision of university regulations, evening classes were severely restricted, so the School of Commerce canceled its evening courses. After the "January 28th Incident," the late President Liu Zhan'en of Shanghai University, in order to provide a place for good young people to study in their spare time and receive a university education, founded the Shanghai University Downtown Business School on Yuemingyuan Road, focusing on commerce and offering specialized journalism courses and special courses. Classes started at 5 p.m. every day. At one point, five or six hundred ambitious young people used their spare time to attend Shanghai University's night university. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of the Ministry of Education's regulations, the night school was not officially registered, which inevitably made the students feel dissatisfied.

I myself attended night university for two years, going to class every evening. I saw many working young people who served in government agencies or foreign firms, leaving their offices at 5 p.m., carrying their books, and hurrying to school for classes. Everyone was in a rush, entering the school gate one after another, afraid of being late. If there were several nights with three or four classes in a row, they would study on an empty stomach, only returning home to eat dinner at nine or ten o'clock. In the classroom, everyone quietly buried their heads listening to the professor's lecture. This spirit is not found in students attending daytime schools.

After the "August 13th Incident," several universities in Nanshi and Zhabei were unable to hold classes. Some moved inland, while others moved into the concessions. However, due to the overcrowding in the concessions, school buildings became a problem. Several universities could not find school buildings, so they borrowed school buildings from secondary schools for classes. However, those secondary schools also needed to hold their own classes, so they could only lend out their school buildings after their own classes, forcing the universities temporarily borrowing school buildings to start classes only after 4 p.m. Many courses were scheduled in the evening. In this way, daytime universities temporarily seemed to have become night universities as well.

Chapter Five: Spring Arrives in the Emerald Green, Fragrance Floats on the Snowy Sea; Flowers Fly from Tiger Hill, the Moon Fills Li Lake

He Liyu asked, "Where are your two cousins now?" Wu Junsu said, "The elder one is a pilot, and the younger one graduated from artillery school. These two cousins are the most able to endure hardship and the most hard-working people. If it weren't for this war, I'm afraid they would have just become two idle friends, developing into spoiled young masters. So this great war has created many useful people." Wu Junsu was a talkative person, and once she opened the floodgates, she could talk for hours. They sat in the "Idly Clouds" pavilion, watching the white clouds on the lake, freely rolling and unfurling, truly feeling the leisurely atmosphere. He Shuangyu held a cup of tea in her hand, the green color appearing lovely in the glass cup. She asked, "Does Suzhou also produce tea?" Wu Junsu said, "It does produce some, but very little. The largest two peaks of the seventy-two peaks of Taihu Lake in Suzhou are also called Dongting Mountain. They produce a kind of tea called Biluochun, which has a very elegant name. The annual production is not much, but recently the tea farmers there have been promoting trial planting, and the production is already more than before." He Shuangyu said, "Ah! What a lovely name. The three characters 'Biluochun' already make one's mouth water. Is there anywhere to buy Biluochun?" Wu Junsu said, "It's just that the name sounds nice, but the tea itself is just so-so. I'm not particular about drinking tea. People who are particular don't call it drinking tea, but 'tasting tea.' I heard that people in your hometown are very particular about tasting tea. They not only pay attention to the tea leaves, but also to the water. The most particular is using snow water collected from plum blossoms to brew tea. That's really something that idle people and carefree friends do." Wei Airen said, "That's right! It reminds me! This Stone Lake is very close to Guangfu Xuanmu. If the two elder sisters come here when the lunar year ends and spring returns, we can go to Xuanmu together to see the plum blossoms. That place is full of white plum blossoms. When they are in full bloom, from a distance, it looks like a vast expanse of white, forming a sea of flowers. When you get closer, standing under tens of thousands of plum blossoms, it's as if you're immersed in a sea of fragrance, truly feeling the subtle and inconceivable. That's why someone gave that place a name, calling it Fragrant Snow Sea." Wu Junsu said, "Dr. Zhu, when have you ever been there? Your description is so wonderful, full of poetic sense." Zhu Airen smiled and said, "Are only you literary people allowed to have a pen that can convey the essence and wonder? Anyone can feel the beautiful scenery." Wu Junsu said, "Don't worry! I know that the two He sisters won't be returning to Guangdong anytime soon. We can just accompany them on trips." (57)

### International Film News

— (Zhang Peiying)

Italian Films Banned Everywhere, Japanese Stars Rejected, Soviet Film Industry Advances Rapidly, New Changes in British Film Industry, Patriotic Films of Overseas Chinese in the Netherlands, Lin Yutang Writes Screenplays in America, Film City Resists Fascism

(1) Sorini, the former founder of "Film Village" in the Italian capital, specializes in producing films publicizing the dynamics of Italy's dictatorial state. Last year, a total of 184 such films were produced and shipped abroad for screening. Only 18 were screened in the United States, 44 in Britain, and the most, of course, were screened in his comrade's country—Germany, with 72. The rest were banned.

(2) Japanese actress Uemura Yae, who has been with Paramount Pictures in the United States for seven or eight years, was recently abruptly dismissed by the company. The reason is that after the Sino-Japanese War, her films suffered a disastrous drop in box office revenue, which displeased the company. It is said to be unprecedented for foreign actors in Hollywood to be rejected.

(3) Since the completion of the Soviet Union's second Five-Year Plan, its film industry has also advanced rapidly. It is currently producing over 40,000 reels of new films for screening at the 1939 New York World's Fair. These short films will allow foreign audiences to understand the Soviet Union's overview and its national strength.

(4) There has recently been a significant change in the British film industry. An enterprise group called Philips Joint Enterprise Company is preparing to acquire 600 to 700 cinemas throughout Britain. At the same time, an Odeon company is also preparing to acquire 300 cinemas belonging to Gaumont Film Company. It is speculated that there are some wealthy Jewish tycoons who fled from Germany supporting this organization behind the scenes, which is why it has such strong capital.

(5) There are many overseas Chinese in the Netherlands, so domestically produced films originally occupied a considerable position in the Netherlands. After the outbreak of the war, Cantonese films monopolized the entire market, which reduced the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese for believing in their motherland. Therefore, everyone hopes that Shanghai's Mandarin films can be shipped there as soon as possible.

(6) The famous Chinese humorist Lin Yutang is traveling in the United States, engaged in writing and screenwriting, which is popular for a time and well-received by foreigners. Recently, he also wrote a new script for child star Shirley Temple, titled "The Little Craftsman," which is about to begin filming. This is the first time a Chinese person has written a screenplay in Hollywood.

(7) Hollywood filmmakers have recently been vigorously producing films about war to cater to the psychology of people around the world.

(8) Anti-fascist activities in the United States are also clearly expressed and strongly supported in Hollywood. According to statistics, 15,000 film workers have joined the Anti-Fascist Committee (including stars such as Paul Muni and Louise Rainer, who starred in "The Good Earth"). The call for aid to China and Spain has shaken the entire silver city.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City's Liyuan (116)

Sun Laoyuan Can Snuff While Playing the Erhu

First, his fingering is good, his voice is rounded, the sound of the erhu is bright, the decorations are pleasant, the connection is seamless like a coat, and the break is like chopping nails and cutting iron. As for playing the erhu in the lower position, it is his specialty. These advantages aside, just his skill in tuning the strings is that two "ga ga" sounds are enough. When the singer opens his mouth, it just matches the tune he needs, without making any mistakes. This is a hundred times better than the situation where ordinary people cannot tune the instrument properly, no matter how hard they try, and stare blankly at the stage when the singer opens his mouth. In addition, his quickness in connecting the strings is also difficult for others to match.

One day, Shu Yan sang the complete "Empty City Stratagem." That day, the seats were full, and Shu Yan's voice was particularly good. I and several friends got middle seats in the first three rows, and we could hear it particularly clearly. Sun Lao wore an old-fashioned velvet mandarin jacket, kept a yellow beard in the style of Yang Xiang Wu, and carried a black erhu. As soon as he sat down facing the stage, he heard applause throughout the hall. He expected that among the people who came today, there must be some connoisseurs. In "Losing Jieting," apart from the "Two Countries Battle Dragons and Tigers" segment, the other segments that are played fast and sung slowly are difficult to show his strengths. But when the slow beat on the city tower began, he truly had a place to use his skills. The singing was good and had not stopped, and the good erhu playing followed. Sun Lao became happier and happier. When Shu Yan sang the seventh sentence, "King Wen of Zhou visited Jiang Shang and the Zhou Dynasty greatly prospered," he took advantage of the moment when the "prosper" character needed a long tone, and suddenly used his right middle finger to rub some snuff on the ivory snuff dish placed on his left knee. At the moment when he lifted the bow upward, he quickly inhaled the snuff on his right middle finger into both nostrils. It was quick and natural, without affecting Shu Yan's singing and his accompaniment at all. At this time, I saw it very clearly at the stage entrance, and I couldn't help but yelled "Bravo" several times. Of course, it wasn't just me who saw it, and everyone else also started cheering. His trick can be considered divine. Now, twenty years later, when I close my eyes and think about it, it's as if it's right in front of me.

Writing Shadows of the Dance Troupe (13)
— Xiaotian

### Dance Girl Sketches, Section 5

Among dance girls, there is a common psychology regarding the issue of their future destination. This psychology cannot be considered improper. As the saying goes, "A tree grows to a thousand feet, but the leaves fall back to their roots." It can also be said that it is a common psychology among people in general, not just dance girls.

Speaking of the backgrounds of dance girls, it can be said that they are complex. There are daughters of ordinary families, and there are also daughters of noble families; there are female students who have attended school; and there are also kiln transformations of prostitutes; some are families who cannot afford food and clothing, and have no choice but to let their children do this career; and some are abducted by bandits, sold around and forced to make this living; there are all kinds of people, and it is difficult to describe them all. Because their knowledge is uneven, their wishes are also different. Some say: "I would rather be a blade of grass in the courtyard than a small person in someone else's house." Some say: "Whether you do big or small is your own destiny. If you have good luck, you marry into someone's house and are a small person, but soon the big person in their house dies. If you have bad luck, the man marries you and you are the big person, but soon the second and third wives come in one after another. As the saying goes, 'To marry a husband, you must be of one heart; there is no need to be a lady in the hall.'" This is the difference between wanting to be a wife or a concubine. Some believe that marrying a man is for enjoying glory and wealth, so they don't ask about the other person's character or appearance. Even if they are seventy or eighty years old, as long as they have money to support my enjoyment, I can marry them. Some believe that marrying someone is a matter of a lifetime, and they must be handsome in appearance and gentle in nature to be considered qualified. As for the issue of whether they have money or not, that is a small matter. This is the difference between pursuing material enjoyment and spiritual enjoyment. There is another view, which is the most common among dance girls, that the dance guests' visit to the dance hall is just for entertainment purposes. For the dance girls, it is just playing around. When they are tired of playing, they will change to another one. There is no question of a lifelong commitment at all. Therefore, the dance girls should adopt a money-first and pleasure-seeking attitude towards the dance guests. When they see someone with money, they should squeeze some money out of them. When they meet someone beautiful, they should seek pleasure. If they meet someone who is both rich and beautiful, then they might as well seek pleasure and squeeze money at the same time. If they encounter someone who is stingy and ugly, they might as well be straightforward and kick them away. Pimp around today, whore around tomorrow, and just seek immediate happiness. As for the issue of the future, we'll talk about it in the future. This kind of doctrine, it cannot be said that she is wrong, nor can it be said that she is right. In short, the ending is still mostly bitter. There is another view, which can be said to be extremely rare among dance girls, that they were born at the wrong time, which led them to fall into the dust. How can they abandon themselves again? What I sell is a pair of feet, and I definitely don't want my soul and body. Holding on to this principle, they protect their chastity like jade. Every day, the dance hall is filled with people, a sea of people. How can there not be a single person to entrust their whole life to? Whenever a dance guest's solicitation gradually becomes frequent and they are not stingy or ugly, they will question them thoroughly. They will not sacrifice their chastity until they have carefully examined their character and have agreed on marriage. However, I have seen this kind of person but have not heard her speak. I have heard her speak but have not distinguished the truth from the falsehood. I will write about it here, so that it can be classified as one of the types.

He Tianjian Lecturing on Traditional Chinese Painting The traditional Chinese painter He Tianjian, in view of the decline of painting theory and practice, founded the Chinese Painting Association with his colleagues within ten years, and edited the Chinese Painting Monthly and Painting Studies Monthly, exhausting his efforts in the hope of reversing the situation. The atmosphere in the country gradually changed. He realized that it was still difficult to implement his ideas without practical work, so he began to personally teach students. It is heard that He Tianjian, in response to the demands of those who are interested in learning to paint, will officially teach students this spring. They can also learn all subjects, regardless of gender, and is limited to ten students. The application period is from March 10th to April 10th.

According to this game, after the first competition of the Cultural and Educational Center in the past, Mr. Xie Junxun requested Mr. Chen and Mr. Lian to perform. At that time, there were about 3,000 spectators. By the 48th move, when Rook 6 retreated 1, the audience applauded like thunder. Mr. Lian's 52nd move, Rook 6 to 4, was particularly brilliant, making it impossible for Mr. Chen to cope. It was not easy. Mr. Lian is a veteran of the chess world, having been diligently engaged in this field for more than 30 years. He is experienced. This game also shows a glimpse of it.
