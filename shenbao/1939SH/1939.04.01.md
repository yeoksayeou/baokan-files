### The European Anti-Aggression Front is Nearing Completion: Chamberlain Declares Full Support for Poland, France States a Similar Stance, Soviet Government Also Fully Approves

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain, this afternoon, delivered a statement in the House of Commons, saying, "I am very pleased to have the opportunity to explain our country's foreign policy again today. The British government has always had a consistent policy, namely, when disputes arise between countries, we advocate for adjustments through free negotiations. We believe this is the natural and proper way to handle disputes. As far as the British government is concerned, there is no issue in the world that cannot be resolved peacefully. If force or the threat of force is used instead of negotiations, we see no reason for it. As for the current situation, the government is consulting with other governments, as I am sure members of the House of Commons are aware. So far, the exchange of views between the countries concerned has not been completed. However, to fully explain the British government's position, I would like to solemnly declare to the members of the House of Commons that should any action threaten the independence and sovereignty of Poland, and should that country deem it necessary to resist with all its national strength, the British government will immediately provide full assistance. The British government has provided this guarantee to the Polish government, and the French government has authorized me to declare on its behalf that it holds the same attitude as Britain. However, reports of a certain country planning to attack Poland have not yet been officially confirmed by the British government, and we cannot consider them to be true." At this point, the Prime Minister also answered a question from a member of Parliament, saying, "I believe that the points I have just stated are already very clear, but I must add that all that I have said is only for the transitional period before the countries concerned have completed their exchange of views." These so-called countries concerned include the Soviet Union. Foreign Secretary Halifax spoke at length with the Soviet Ambassador Maisky this morning. "The principles on which the British government's actions are based have been fully understood and approved by the Soviet government." In addition, one more point must be stated, namely that Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck will come to London within the next week. (Members of Parliament applaud.) Recently, Mr. Greenwood spoke of promoting the maximum degree of cooperation, and I agree. Once Foreign Minister Beck arrives here, we can hold talks with him to discuss various ways to establish the maximum degree of cooperation to prevent aggression and seek the realization of a more rational form of negotiation to replace force." Prime Minister Chamberlain then answered a question from a member of Parliament, saying, "The government's actions have been notified to the various autonomous territories at any time, and I have no hesitation in guaranteeing that there is no disagreement between Britain and the Soviet Union in terms of thought," (Havas dispatch, 31st)

(London) The Prime Minister entered the House at 2:50 PM, and everyone cheered to welcome him. Prime Minister Chamberlain said, "The House knows that the British government is currently in consultation with other governments. In order to make the British government's position clear before this consultation is concluded, I am now informing the House that, during the consultation period, should any action clearly endanger the independence of Poland, and should the Polish government deem it necessary to resist with all its national force, the British government feels it has an inescapable duty to immediately assist Poland with all the power it can. The British government has given this guarantee to the Polish government." His remarks are intended to cover the period when the British government is in consultation with other governments. The arrival of Polish Foreign Minister Beck in London will provide an opportunity to discuss various plans, so that any cooperative efforts to end aggression can reach the highest degree, and a more rational and orderly method of discussion can replace the current consultations. This afternoon's important statement and supplementary questions and answers in the House of Commons took only seventeen minutes. Then the House announced an adjournment until April 3. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated clearly in the House of Commons this afternoon that Britain will not stand idly by while other countries continue to engage in aggression in Europe. The British government's decision was the result of thorough discussions between the cabinet and the governments of Britain, France, Poland, and Romania yesterday. The detailed measures agreed upon remain secret, but their characteristic is to make recommendations to the two Baltic countries to expand their mutual assistance agreements to include the possibility of being attacked by Germany. It is heard that Poland made the decision late yesterday to accept this recommendation, and there is no doubt that Romania will accept it as well. Britain and France then decided that if either of the two Baltic countries becomes the target of German aggression in the future, Britain and France are prepared to come to their aid. The sudden acceleration of negotiations between the four capitals is largely due to disturbing news of military plans coming from the German side. The officials of the four countries, after receiving this alarming news, felt that if they waited for Polish Foreign Minister Beck to arrive in London on April 3 to discuss the matter, they would risk the great danger of not being able to decide on a position to resist the invasion.

### Tense Relations Between Germany and Poland: Britain Holds a Special Cabinet Meeting, Polish Foreign Minister to Visit Britain as Scheduled, America Also Determined to Support by Denying Rumors

(London) The sudden convening of the British cabinet meeting today has caused considerable surprise among the general public. According to a Reuters parliamentary correspondent, the meeting gave special consideration to information concerning Poland. It is believed that this cabinet meeting was decided last night, and it is expected that the information concerning Poland considered at today's cabinet meeting may not prove to be the final conclusion. It is hoped that Polish Foreign Minister Beck's visit to London next week may clarify the current situation. At the same time, it is heard that the cabinet members are unanimous and resolute in their opinions on the proposed anti-aggression declaration. According to a Reuters correspondent, if there is any delay in the issuance of this declaration, the main reason must be due to close discussions with France, as this step is necessary before the final draft of the declaration is issued. Also, judging from the fact that the opposition party did not raise any questions during today's meeting of the House of Commons, it can be seen that opinions in Parliament have become stronger. This situation is quite obvious tonight. A Reuters correspondent repeatedly stated that all political parties are willing for the government to issue a declaration as soon as possible, and that no one wants to hinder the government's work. After today's cabinet meeting, the cabinet members who are most closely related to foreign affairs did not leave, in order to continue the discussion. The content of today's cabinet meeting is currently being kept strictly secret, but it is heard that the government is still determined to maintain and develop its efforts to prevent continued aggression. According to a Reuters parliamentary correspondent, the government's views have become significantly stronger in the past forty-eight hours, largely due to information coming from overseas. The strict secrecy of the cabinet meeting has given rise to many rumors that the government may take certain actions, but such news can only be regarded as speculation. At the same time, consultations between the capitals of various countries, especially London and Paris, are currently underway. Polish Ambassador to Britain Raczynski visited the British Foreign Office today and held consultations at the Foreign Office after the cabinet meeting adjourned. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

(London) This morning, the Prime Minister's Office suddenly convened a special cabinet meeting, which began as early as 8:45 AM, which is unprecedented. Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon, Minister for Coordination of Defence Chatfield, Minister for Dominion Affairs Inskip, and First Lord of the Admiralty Stanhope were all present. It lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes before adjourning. It is believed that the cabinet members discussed the speech that the Prime Minister will deliver in the House of Commons this afternoon. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

(London) The British cabinet has decided that if Poland and Romania are attacked by foreign countries, Britain will provide assistance. This decision indicates that British foreign policy has entered a new stage. Negotiations between the capitals of the countries concerned are currently underway. After receiving the replies of France and Poland regarding the British guarantee treaty plan, Britain has notified Moscow and is continuing negotiations with it. Romania and Poland are also currently in negotiations with Britain, to a degree that is significantly deeper than is generally known. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 31st)

(London) Germany has concentrated troops in Pomerania, especially in the area of ​​Frankfurt on the Oder River. The situation on the border between Poland and Germany is therefore extremely tense. After this news reached London, the British government was extremely concerned. Although the latest news said that two German divisions had been transferred from the vicinity of the Polish border to other places, the uneasiness here has not been dispelled. The cabinet therefore held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the matter. The cabinet's foreign affairs committee also held a meeting in the afternoon. According to reliable sources, Prime Minister Chamberlain has decided to issue a statement in the House of Commons tomorrow morning, saying that if Poland is invaded by Germany, Britain and France will immediately come to its aid. Political figures have recently commented that although Britain and France have agreed to help Poland, it is still possible for Germany and Poland to reach a friendly solution regarding the issues of the Free City of Danzig and the construction of a highway across the Polish Corridor between the German provinces of Pomerania and East Prussia. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

(Washington) According to sources in diplomatic and other circles, the U.S. government believes that Europe will remain tense in the near future, and believes that the dictatorships intend to impose "another Munich" on the democracies. Therefore, the United States will relax neutrality laws next week, hoping to help create a "peace of unyielding." (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

### Polish President Receives Leaders of Various Opposition Parties in a Secret Three-Hour Meeting

Warsaw Polish President Moscicki met with seven important members of the opposition parties, as well as university professors related to the opposition parties, at Warsaw Palace yesterday to discuss Polish foreign and domestic affairs for three hours. Political figures are paying close attention to this. Moscicki then met with the leader of the National Peasant Party and informed him that the government would implement amnesty laws to assist the leader of the party, former Prime Minister Witos. Witos had previously fled abroad and recently returned to Poland. All parties regard the President's move as a symbol of seeking harmony among all parties. However, informed sources said that the facts are not as simple as that, and this view cannot be regarded as definitive. In recent years, President Moscicki has often summoned representatives of the opposition parties to listen to their opinions on national affairs, but has never put them into practice. (Haitong dispatch, 31st)

Warsaw Rumors that Germany has presented an ultimatum to Poland or that it has exerted pressure on Poland have recently been denied by the local newspapers, which published a semi-official message stating, "We are now authorized by the authorities to solemnly declare that Poland has neither received any ultimatum nor felt any pressure." (Havas dispatch, 31st)

### Poland and Lithuania Negotiating a Non-Aggression Treaty

Warsaw It is widely rumored here that the governments of Poland and Lithuania are currently negotiating to prepare to sign a non-aggression agreement. The government has neither confirmed nor denied this, but the local newspapers all say that it is essential for Poland and Lithuania to foster friendly relations. (Havas, 30th)

### After Visiting Britain, the Polish Foreign Minister Will Go to Paris, But Will Not Stop in Berlin. Germany Only Offers Suggestions to Poland.

Warsaw The newspapers here tonight unanimously stressed that Polish Foreign Minister Beck's visit to London is extremely important. Observers do not believe the rumor that Beck will get off the train in Berlin midway. According to sources here, if Pack did this, it would only indicate that this was due to German pressure and would endanger the Polish government's freedom to conduct diplomacy. The Warsaw Daily, which is detached, criticized Poland's current position in Europe as extremely important. The whole world is now paying attention to Poland's actions. The newspaper also hinted that the week in which Beck returns to Warsaw from London will be the key to deciding on a policy towards Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

(Paris) Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck is scheduled to visit Britain on the third of next month. Foreign Minister Bonnet is said to have asked him to take the opportunity to come to Paris as well. Foreign Minister Beck has also accepted, but the date has not yet been determined. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

(Berlin) The Berlin newspapers rarely mention Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's upcoming visit to London, and rarely report on current German-Polish relations. Regarding the rumor that Colonel Beck will travel to London via Berlin, the newspapers here stated that Colonel Beck's stay in Berlin will be very short and that he does not intend to hold any consultations with German officials. The newspapers have remained silent on the anti-German movement that has occurred in Poland in recent days. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 31st)

(Berlin) Reuters has learned from well-informed sources that rumors that Germany has made demands on Poland, or even issued an ultimatum, are exaggerated. The authorities do not deny that Germany has made certain suggestions to Poland, but it is said that it is too early to join the Anti-Comintern Pact. Germany has not urged Poland to build a highway through the "Polish Corridor." It is said that this road is difficult to construct and costly, and that its completion would provide smugglers with an excellent opportunity. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels is currently staying in Bavaria with Hitler, Aviation Minister Goering is currently in Italy, and Economic Minister Funk is currently busy with the affairs of the Deutsche Bank. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the cabinet will hold a secret meeting here. The newspapers have not yet revealed the authorities' opinions or aspirations regarding the Polish issue. Reuters has also learned that Polish Foreign Minister Beck will not get off the train midway when he travels from Warsaw to London next week. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)

### German Interior Minister Announces Polish Mistreatment of Germans, Saying Retaliatory Measures Will Be Taken, While Polish Newspapers Say German Residents are Causing Trouble

(Berlin) Interior Minister Frick recently delivered a speech, saying that the minority residents of various countries enjoy preferential treatment within Germany. The situation of German minorities living in other countries, especially in Poland, is extremely difficult, which is regrettable. Although Germany and Poland jointly issued a statement in November 1937, the issue of the treatment of ethnic minorities on both sides has not been effectively resolved. Representatives of the two countries recently reopened negotiations here, hoping to reach a satisfactory solution as soon as possible. In addition, Germany is eager to cooperate peacefully with Yugoslavia, and hopes that the issue of the German minority in that country can be resolved reasonably. The situation of Germans in Denmark and Hungary is also not very satisfactory. However, if the authorities of various countries mistreat German minorities, then the residents of that country living in Germany will also receive the same treatment. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

Warsaw The Warsaw Express recently reported that German minorities in the city of Rybnik in Upper Silesia have recently imitated the methods of the Sudeten German Party members in the former Czech Republic by wearing white socks and strolling the streets. After friendly persuasion from passers-by failed, many Polish citizens volunteered to remove the white socks worn by these people on the spot. In addition, there have been many similar provocative actions by the Germans, which have also been severely punished. (Havas dispatch, 30th)

### Italy Takes a Wait-and-See Approach to France

(Rome) At present, the Italian people feel more uneasy about German-Polish relations than about French Prime Minister Daladier's speech. Gazzetta d'Italia criticized Daladier's speech, saying, "The French have clearly indicated that they want to close the door that we have opened, but Italians are not incapable of patience and can wait and see." (Reuters dispatch, 31st)

(Rome) After French Prime Minister Daladier delivered a speech the other day, Italy will likely adopt a wait-and-see attitude towards France in the near future. As relations between Germany and Poland become increasingly tense, Italy is naturally paying close attention to future developments in the situation in Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Therefore, it can only postpone things with France and wait and see how the situation unfolds before deciding what to do. Regardless of what the Italian government's intentions are, it is clear that the attitude of the Italian newspapers is generally very subtle and shows no sign of increasing the seriousness of the situation. Commentators generally say that although France's attitude is still strong, Italy can clearly recognize where its own rights lie, how strong its power is, and what its future may hold, so it can also wait patiently for the opportunity to arrive. Il Giornale d'Italia stated, "Italy does not ask for anything, but France should consider its own interests." (Havas dispatch, 31st)

Editorial

### Review and Prospects of Franco-Italian Relations

On the 26th of last month, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech at the 20th anniversary of the Fascist Party, making claims to France regarding rights in Tunisia, Suez, and Djibouti. At the time, Mussolini's attitude was relatively mild, but his spokesman, Gayda, published articles in newspapers in Rome and London, explaining these three demands and saying that if France did not provide appropriate solutions, Franco-Italian relations would never be repaired. His words were quite threatening to France.

Therefore, French Prime Minister Daladier gave a broadcast speech on the 29th, saying that France was willing to negotiate based on the Franco-Italian Rome Agreement of 1935. But France would never give up an inch of land, nor would it give up the slightest right. We know that the Rome Agreement was unilaterally abandoned by Mussolini long ago, and now that France is unwilling to give up any more land or rights outside of this agreement, it is bound to disappoint Mussolini.

The Rome Agreement was originally the precursor to the improvement of relations between France and Italy and the stabilization of the European situation. Before the Rome Agreement, they had always been in a position of opposition and struggle in order to compete for hegemony in the Danube River basin and for colonies in Africa. After Hitler came to power in 1933, he tried his best to expand his power into the Danube River basin. Because France and Italy were both threatened, they changed their previous policies and concluded the Rome Agreement in January 1935. The agreement stipulated that France should cede to Italy the area south of Italian Libya to the old volcanoes of Tibesti, and the area north of the Tajura Bay in French Somaliland, which is adjacent to Italian Eritrea. With this piece of land, Italy would be able to extend its power to Bab el Mandab and hold the southern end of the Red Sea, just like Britain with its possession of Aden. Secondly, France also transferred a portion of the shares of the railway from Djibouti to the capital of Abyssinia to Italy, so that it also had the right to operate the railway. In addition, France also allowed Italians in French Tunisia to retain their nationality until 1945. This means that only Italians born in Tunisia after 1945 would be subject to French law. France gave Italy these many interests in Africa, satisfying its colonial desires in Africa, with the aim of making Italy give up its ambition to compete with France for hegemony in the Danube River basin and work together to prevent Hitler's southward advance. But in fact, Mussolini not only failed to unite with France to restrain Germany, but instead colluded with Germany to engage in aggression. He helped Hitler annex Austria and Czechoslovakia, and actively presided over the Spanish Civil War. He sent volunteers to Madrid, controlled the heart of Spain, threatened British Gibraltar; and stationed heavy troops at the foot of the Pyrenees Mountains, threatening southwestern France. But on the other hand, Mussolini saw that after Germany annexed Austria and Czechoslovakia, its power was likely to extend into the Adriatic Sea, threatening the northern Mediterranean, which was "essential for the survival" of Italy. The excessive expansion of German power was also unfavorable to Italy. Therefore, in order to increase its power in the southern and eastern Mediterranean, it made these demands on France.

In the past, France always followed Britain in dealing with the demands of aggressor countries, adopting a policy of inaction and accommodation. But the result of accommodation has instead fueled the ambitions of the aggressors. This time, Italy's demands directly threaten France's lifeline. Because, first, Tunisia is in French North Africa, located on the opposite side of the Italian islands of Sicily and Sardinia, which is a very important military area. If it is occupied by Italy and controls the central Mediterranean, then French Algeria and Morocco will be threatened. Second, the Suez Canal is the main route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. If Italy obtains management rights, it can increase its power in the western Mediterranean. Third, Djibouti is a fortress at the southern end of the Red Sea, facing Aden across the sea. If Italy's power is strengthened there, it can control the traffic in the Red Sea and the Near East. In short, Italy's three demands are aimed at controlling France's transportation with Africa and the Near East. France's colonies are second only to Britain in size, and most of its colonies are located in Africa. Once transportation with the colonies is controlled, what is the difference between this and giving up all its colonies?

France has learned many lessons and been deceived by its inaction and accommodation towards aggressors. It should have been aware of this long ago. Now, in addition to expressing that it will not give up an inch of land or the slightest right, Daladier is also calling on peace-loving countries to step up cooperation to stop future aggression by aggressors. This is certainly necessary. But we hope that France's attitude can become more active and take more effective measures to punish aggressors.

### Large Quantities of Munitions Arrive in Rangoon for Shipment to Kunming; Soviet Attitude in Fisheries Negotiations Changes Again; Japanese Authorities Meet with British, American, and French Ambassadors

(Tokyo) This morning, Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Sawada, representing Foreign Minister Arita, separately invited the British, American, and French ambassadors to Japan to the Foreign Ministry to discuss diplomatic matters. However, the nature of these matters has not yet been disclosed. (Reuters, 31st)

Rangoon Large quantities of munitions are currently arriving here steadily, to be transported to China via the Burma Road. The details regarding quantity, value, and nature are unknown. The Burmese government neither hinders nor facilitates the transshipment of munitions. Therefore, the speed of transporting these munitions into China depends entirely on the ability of the Chinese transportation authorities to handle traffic matters. Various military supplies are transported by rail to the border and then by road to Kunming. The Southwest Transportation Company manages automobile transshipment, and it has now established an office in Rangoon. The Burmese government does not collect export taxes on Burmese gasoline transported via the highway. This measure is likely for commercial reasons rather than political relations, as Burma is willing to encourage China to purchase gasoline from Burma. (Reuters, 31st)

(Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry announced today that the Moscow fisheries negotiations were almost peacefully concluded. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, the Soviet government's attitude suddenly changed, causing obstructions. From the Japanese standpoint, there is no reason for the change in the Soviet attitude. Negotiations are still in progress, and the representatives of both sides met again yesterday. However, the results are yet to be reported. (Reuters, 31st)

(Tokyo) The Cabinet formally decided yesterday to invoke Article 11 of the National Mobilization Law. This article regulates the profits and capital flow of controlled companies and restricts dividends, effective from April 10th. (Reuters, 31st)

(Washington) According to news from here today, American Ambassador to China, Johnson, currently in the United States on duty leave, will soon report on the situation in China at the request of Congress. (Associated Press, 31st)

(Moscow) The claim circulated by Japan that China and the Soviet Union have already established a military alliance treaty has been denied by Soviet officials. Observers here also say that this rumor was sparked by the news of Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan of China, traveling to the Soviet Union. There is no news here to confirm Sun's whereabouts, and it is unknown whether he has arrived in Moscow. When Sun Ke traveled to the Soviet Union last year, his movements were reported by Soviet newspapers, as his journey from various European capitals to Russia could not be kept secret. (Havas, 30th)

### Hitler to Deliver Speech Today

(Berlin) The launching ceremony for Germany's new battleship, the "Tirpitz," is scheduled for tomorrow at the Wilhelmshaven port. At that time, Führer Hitler will deliver a speech. The rumor circulating that Hitler will take this opportunity to announce the abolition of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement is considered unfounded by well-informed sources here. On the contrary, Hitler's speech will try to avoid mentioning the Anglo-German Naval Agreement because British policy is currently wavering, and German-Polish relations have not yet been adjusted. (Haitong Telegram, 31st)

### Struggle for Central Europe; France and Romania Sign Economic and Cultural Agreements; Romanian Minister Presents Credentials to Hitler; German Economic Minister Explains Significance of German-Romanian Trade Agreement

(Paris) The commercial agreement negotiated between France and Romania was formally signed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 12:20 this afternoon by Foreign Minister Bonnet and Romanian Ambassador Tatarescu. The main points are to increase the volume of trade between the two countries and to stipulate that France should reduce the import tariffs on Romanian agricultural products appropriately. Ambassador Tatarescu also made a statement to the press, expressing satisfaction with the agreement. He said, "The standard of living in our country is still too low. To raise the standard of living, we must obtain a larger market for agricultural and mineral products. This is one. Our country needs foreign capital to actively develop its mining and timber industries. This is two. However, our country does not need to grant exclusive rights to others within its borders, neither in the past nor in the future. Because after a country is economically controlled by others, it will inevitably lose its autonomy politically sooner or later. We are aware of this, so the current economic policy is based on defending the country's political independence and territorial integrity. As for the commercial agreement signed between France and Romania today, it is well-received in our country and is considered the first step in international economic cooperation. The friendship between France and Romania has always been a major element of European peace, and it will inevitably become stronger after the signing of this commercial agreement." (Havas, 31st)

(Bucharest, Romania) Foreign Minister Gafencu recently signed a cultural agreement with French Ambassador Thierry to enhance cultural and scientific relations between France and Romania. Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense and Interior Calinescu was also present. (Havas, 31st)

(Berlin) The newly appointed Romanian Minister to Germany, Cretzianu, presented his credentials to Führer Hitler at noon today and gave a speech stating that the close economic relations between Germany and Romania are clearly demonstrated by the fact that both countries use the Danube River as a transportation route and that the needs of the two countries are complementary. Führer Hitler then responded, saying that the recently concluded supplementary commercial agreement between Germany and Romania has established a good relationship between the two sides and opened up a new era of economic cooperation. (Havas, 31st)

(Berlin) German Minister of National Economy and President of the Deutsche Bank, Funk, said today that the newly concluded German-Romanian trade agreement is a pioneering move. This measure did not use "silver bullets." Germany's productivity is increasing, the standard of living of the people is improving, and at the same time, Germany's export possibilities are also improving. Germany will never again allow its economy to depend on internationally manipulated monetary policies. Countries lacking capital will never again allow themselves to rely on others by borrowing foreign debt. They all want to strengthen their own production to strengthen the purchasing power of their people by selling products. Germany will reclaim the Deutsche Bank shares abroad from the holders and compensate them for their losses. Funk also discussed the necessity of re-establishing strong economic relations between countries, saying that the foundation of the world economy has already changed. Countries with full national power will no longer be bound by the international gold standard or international debt entanglement. (Haitong News Agency, 30th)

(Paris) After the signing of the commercial agreement between France and Romania, Foreign Minister Bonnet gave a statement to the newspapers, saying, "The friendly relations and cooperation between France and Romania are an important foundation for European peace, and it is gratifying that this has been expressed by this commercial agreement." He also hoped that the two countries would be able to work together more closely in the near future and achieve something. Minister of Commerce Gentin also spoke, saying, "Trade between France and Romania will be fully developed on the basis of this agreement. French commercial policy will therefore form a new trend. In other words, the quantity of goods France should purchase should be based on the size of the quantity of French goods that the other party can purchase. The economic relationship between France and Romania can be further developed through this agreement, and we often encourage investment in Romania to enhance the economic relationship between the two countries." (Havas, 31st)

### Argentina Also Wary of Germany

(Buenos Aires, Argentina) After the conspiracies of the German Nazi Party in the Patagonia province in southern Argentina were exposed by the newspapers, it has been reported informally that the Argentine government has begun an investigation. Once the investigation is clear, appropriate measures will be taken to deal with it. (Havas, 30th)

### Japanese Troops Fiercely Attack Gao'an in Northern Jiangxi; Chinese Troops Resisting Strongly; One Japanese Tank Destroyed, Many Spoils of War Obtained; Chinese Troops in Wuning Inflict Heavy Losses on the Japanese, then Move to New Positions

(Hong Kong) Guilin dispatch: After the Japanese army occupied Nanchang, they continued their southward advance, attempting to seize the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. After days of interception by the Chinese army, they suffered over a thousand casualties. Some Chinese units have been reinforced to inflict heavy losses on the Japanese army again north of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Chinese troops near Wuning are launching fierce counterattacks. Chinese troops near Fengxin and Gao'an on the south bank of the Xiushui River are also continuing to attack the Japanese army. (Special Dispatch, 3:00 PM, 1st)

(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, after the Chinese army withdrew from Nanchang in Jiangxi Province on March 29, Chinese and Japanese troops are now fighting for Gao'an on the road from Nanchang to Changsha. The fighting south of Nanchang is taking place near the outskirts of Xiangtan. It is reported that the Japanese army west of Nanchang is attacking Gao'an from three directions: north, northeast, and east. The two sides are fighting six miles from Gao'an. Another Japanese force is attempting to encircle the Chinese army's flank and cut off the road west of Gao'an. According to Chinese dispatches, the Chinese army recaptured Fengxin, northeast of Gao'an, in a counterattack on March 29. The dispatch also described the heroic resistance of the Chinese army defending Wuning, saying that the Chinese army defended the mountains on both sides of the road and inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army. (Reuters, 31st)

(Hong Kong) On the 29th, the Chinese army in northern Jiangxi launched a full-scale fierce attack. In the afternoon, they recaptured Fengxin. The Japanese army attacking Wuning suffered repeated heavy losses and are still engaged in fierce battles northeast of Wuning. (Dispatch, 31st)

(Chongqing) Well-informed Chinese sources here recently issued a report on the war situation in Jiangxi Province, the main points of which are as follows: Fierce battles are still taking place near the outskirts of Nanchang. The Chinese army is now retreating to Fengcheng, 30 miles south of Nanchang, while the Japanese army continues to advance towards Jingjiang, attempting to cut off the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, i.e., the Chinese army's eastward retreat. According to Chinese official reports, the Battle of Nanchang resulted in heavy casualties, with a total of 20,000 killed. However, no estimates were made of Japanese casualties. Chinese military sources predict that after occupying Nanchang, the Japanese army will continue to advance into southern Jiangxi and Changsha south of Dongting Lake, and Yichang north of Dongting Lake. However, after changing positions, the Chinese army will take defensive measures and wait in full battle array. (Haitong News Agency, 31st)

Zhangshu The Japanese army's attempt to attack Gao'an is becoming more active.

### A Typical War of Attrition in Shanxi Province; Japanese Troops Gain Nothing After Repeated Battles and Are Weary of Running Around; Finding an Empty City and Their Transportation Cut Off; Civilians in Xin County Slaughtered

A certain location in Shanxi Province: We crossed exhausted horses late at night and entered Qixian County in Shanxi Province, which the Japanese army had invaded twice but were ultimately forced to abandon. The next morning, the county magistrate formally met with us. He was a man in his forties, appearing very capable. His notebook contained detailed information about the city's experiences. I record the main points below:

The Japanese army knew that this city was an important center in Shanxi Province. Over a year ago, they crossed the mountains to invade. The residents had moved all food and valuables in advance and then abandoned the city, which is a common occurrence in Shanxi Province. However, this city still suffered losses of up to 150,000 yuan due to Japanese damage. Many houses were burned down. Approximately four hundred wounded Chinese soldiers who could not be moved in the city were stabbed to death by the Japanese army. Later, after about ten days of guerrilla attacks, the Japanese army retreated towards the railway. It was not until the Chinese army entered the city that they learned that the previously wounded soldiers had been brutally murdered by the Japanese army.

Last December, this city was attacked for the second time. The residents took the same preventive measures, first moving the food out of the city and burying other items underground. The second loss amounted to 200,000 yuan. The Japanese army, totaling 20,000 men, advanced in three routes. The Chinese army did not put up strong resistance, allowing the Japanese army to occupy it. However, the Chinese army circled to the rear of the Japanese army and cut off their supply lines. During the Japanese occupation, they gathered nine hundred head of livestock to gorge themselves, and eighty-seven people were brutally killed by the Japanese army, including seventy-one farmers and the rest local civil servants.

The county magistrate then recounted a tale of courage, saying that one mile from the city, there was a precarious mountain peak that could only be reached by using a rope ladder. Nine households lived there. When they saw the Japanese army approaching and demanding food, they immediately pulled up the rope ladder. When the Japanese army tried to climb the cliff, they threw stones and furniture at them. Several Japanese soldiers died as a result. After four days of resistance, the Japanese army finally climbed up, and all the residents were slaughtered, with approximately thirty deaths. Only four young children survived, two of whom were injured and the other two pretended to be dead and escaped. Soon after, the Japanese army was forced to abandon Qixian County and retreated across the mountains starting in mid-winter. After the county magistrate recounted everything, it was confirmed by senior Chinese military officers that the Japanese army's transportation was cut off, and food was running out, so they had no choice but to retreat. The Chinese army took the opportunity to guard the mountain passes and attack the Japanese army. The Japanese army, lacking both ammunition and food, struggled to escape along the way.

The county magistrate concluded by saying that, according to Chinese reports, the Japanese army suffered casualties of one-quarter, including several senior officers, totaling as many as five thousand men. Before we set off again, we took a walk through the streets of Qixian County. The county is a typical small Chinese county, the city located in a narrow valley between two mountains. Approximately one-fifth of the houses were destroyed, but the farmers in the city were bustling about, and trade was booming. We often saw donkeys and horses carrying goods in single file, passing through the narrow cobblestone streets. There were many open-air stalls along the way, each surrounded by many people. These stalls were mostly set up on the ruins after the destruction and sold a wide variety of goods. Everyone seemed to be determined to continue business as usual.

The county magistrate also told the Reuters reporter that if the Japanese army came again, they would do the same as before, leaving an empty city and cutting off their transportation, waiting for them to have to retreat. The county government would move to the mountains a few miles outside the city to work, and when the Japanese army had left, they would move back to the city.

### There Are 900,000 Ethnic Minorities in Germany

(Berlin) German Interior Minister Dr. Frick, in a speech at a reception for the diplomatic corps and journalists last night, said that the German-Polish Minority Declaration of November 5, 1937, was unfortunately insufficient to satisfy all desires. The million German ethnic minorities in Poland have a variety of pressing issues that need to be resolved. The German government also hopes to improve the status of the 650,000 Germans in Hungary, but believes that its friendly ally Hungary will be able to take measures to satisfy the demands of the German people as soon as possible. Dr. Frick then reported on the population survey in Germany, stating that there were 300,000 Czechs in the Sudetenland and 30,000 in Vienna, but the Czechs in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia could not be regarded as ethnic minorities because they were the people of the Protectorate and their status was completely different. In addition to the aforementioned 330,000 Czechs, Germany has 113,000 Poles in the east, 40,000 Croats, 30,000 Slovenes, 100,000 Hungarians, and 5,000 to 10,000 Danes and Lithuanians each. In addition, there are 285,000 people who speak both German and Polish, totaling approximately 920,000 people. This fact makes it necessary for all ethnic minorities to enjoy natural rights, such as the Czech language schools in the Sudetenland, and the Polish community has two high schools and sixty-two elementary schools, all of which teach in Polish.

### Tokyo Reports Generalissimo Chiang's Plan for a Major Counteroffensive in North China; An Attack from the South on the Japanese Army Along the Longhai Railway, with the Jin-Cha-Sui Area Also Becoming a Counteroffensive Battlefield

(Tokyo) According to reports from various newspapers here, citing reliable sources from Beiping, General Chiang Kai-shek is reportedly planning a large-scale general offensive in North China in the near future. Judging from the troop movements of the Chinese army, an attack will soon be launched from the south against the Japanese army along the various sections of the Longhai Railway. Simultaneously, an advance will be initiated from Xi'an Prefecture in Shaanxi towards southern Shanxi. Furthermore, the Suiyuan and Chahar regions will also become battlefields for the Chinese army's counteroffensive. The reports point out that General Chiang Kai-shek, who previously exerted great efforts to promote guerrilla warfare on various fronts, is now taking a step further by launching a general counteroffensive, with the intention of enhancing the fighting spirit of the Chinese army and increasing the belief of third countries in the combat effectiveness of the Chinese army, thereby hoping to obtain substantial assistance from Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, Japanese military figures also anticipate an increase in Chinese military activities, but express doubts as to whether the current counteroffensive can truly be carried out on a large scale.

### Shanxi Army and People Unite to Resist Japan; Japanese Prisoner Says Japan is About to Go Bankrupt, and China Will Be a Merciful Victor

Somewhere in Shanxi: In a remote village in Shanxi province, this reporter unexpectedly encountered three Japanese prisoners. All three are currently working for the Chinese army, translating political texts. This reporter was traveling with a certain division commander of the Chinese army heading to a guerrilla area. We arrived at a village in the mountains around noon and stopped to inspect it. We were then led to tour the surroundings and introduced to the Japanese prisoners. The Japanese prisoners were all dressed in light blue Chinese uniforms, indistinguishable from the other workers in the village, which has now become a political center. The Japanese prisoners seen were all Japanese farmers. A Korean interpreter provided translation. According to one Japanese prisoner, his father was a farmer. After being drafted, he was trained to drive trucks and assigned to China. The other two also said they were truck drivers and that they had been captured near Linfen in western Shanxi after getting lost. In response to the reporter's questions, they all said that the treatment by the Chinese side was very generous. When the reporter asked them to express their opinions, all three had tears in their eyes and looked down at each other for a while. One of them then mustered the courage to say, "This war is really due to Japanese imperialism. China is fighting for justice and peace." They all believe that Japan will soon go bankrupt, and China will be victorious and be a merciful victor. The Japanese prisoners also said that they all felt depressed because, according to Japanese law, soldiers are not allowed to return to their home country once they are captured. During this reporter's trip through Shanxi and Shaanxi, two things seemed particularly noteworthy: (1) the people's resolute resistance to Japan and (2) the extremely thorough methods of politically and militarily organizing the peasants. Each village has a political education center engaged in organizing meetings, speeches, and dramas, as well as posting slogans. Even in the smallest villages, the village head is assisted by the nearest larger villages in handling various tasks. These larger towns often have offices of the "Sacrifice to Save the Nation Association" and other organizations to handle this work. In addition, local self-defense corps are used to teach the people the essentials of military training, which is more systematic than before. Therefore, farmers can have thorough cooperation with regular troops. "The army and the people must unite" has become the most popular slogan in Shanxi province today. Army-people cooperation songs can be heard at any time. The reporter wanted to find a flaw in various gatherings but could not. All the people were seen to be enthusiastically engaged in various new war activities. The reporter was the first person from the press to come to this most remote area of Shanxi province, so the people all united to express their welcome and said that they were all willing to engage in arduous struggle. Local self-defense corps also automatically entertained the reporter. Some of their members were armed with spears, while others were unarmed. Currently, farmers throughout Shanxi province have very harmonious feelings towards the soldiers. The reporter once accompanied a small squad of soldiers on horseback and was warmly entertained by the farmers everywhere, who provided food and various assistance. On one occasion, we stopped to rest in the mountains, and the people living in caves there rushed to provide us with boiling water to quench our thirst and came to chat with us. When the reporter asked if they had any eggs, they hurriedly presented us with fifty, but the soldiers who were with us insisted on paying for them. The situation where Chinese farmers willingly give food to soldiers, but the soldiers insist on paying for it, is probably something that no one would have believed in the past. When the reporter needed a guide, several young people volunteered to act as guides. Once, when crossing the Yellow River, the division commander traveling with the reporter and the reporter stood side by side on the shore. The division commander pointed to the deep gorge by the river and said, "Japan may be as strong as these rocks, and China as weak as the river water, but one day we will grind this rock away just as the Yellow River does."

### Villagers Capture Enemy with Bare Hands, Capturing a Japanese Pilot

(Chongqing) According to a telegram from the Political Department of the □th Division in Maojin, southern Shanxi, the army shot down a Japanese Type 94 bomber on the 28th. Japanese pilot Lieutenant Kiyoshi Yamada fired his gun and attempted to escape, but Fan Zengkuo, a resident of Pinglong Village, bravely rushed forward. When Yamada was loading his gun, Fan forcefully grabbed his waist. Yamada immediately struck Fan's head with his pistol, causing him to bleed profusely, but he still refused to let go. After the army arrived, Yamada was finally captured alive. Fan Zengkuo originally had no official position, but his hatred of the enemy was particularly deep. His selfless disregard for his own safety is commendable. He has already been awarded by the Military Affairs Commission in accordance with regulations, and a special commendation has been requested from the National Government. In addition, Secretary Lin of the same department managed to persuade Yamada Kiyoshi to become aware of the situation and surrender. He publicly announced the crimes of the Japanese warlords and translated Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will into Japanese. Clerk Ding of the same department encouraged the people to encircle and capture Yamada. All are models of political workers and have been given a major commendation each to encourage them. (Telegraph, 30th)

### Distrust Between Japanese and Puppet Troops in Sui-Bao Intensifies

### The New Fourth Army's Year of War Resistance: Experiences and Lessons (5)

— Xiang Ying

Second Period: After our army entered, Japanese imperialism carried out extensive activities. First, they scattered leaflets everywhere from airplanes, saying that the Red Army's fight against local tyrants was the work of the Communist Party, attempting to create class conflicts and prevent the masses from connecting with us, thereby undermining our unity. However, because our army, after entering this area, proved through our actions and our battles that our army had good discipline and was safeguarding the interests of the people, the enemy's propaganda lost its effectiveness. Second, they used force to suppress the common people, preventing them from approaching us. If they didn't, they would bombard with artillery and burn houses, causing the people to beg the New Fourth Army not to come, lest their houses be burned. However, later, in places where we didn't go, they still burned and killed in the same way. The common people gradually realized that the enemy's propaganda was deceiving them. Third, there was political propaganda. The enemy, using anti-communism and anti-Chiang as a pretext, told the people that they were suffering from the disasters of war because of the Communist Party and Chiang Kai-shek, and that to seek peace, they had to oppose the Communist Party and oppose Chiang Kai-shek. The enemy's central slogan was to oppose the main force of China's resistance. This meant that after our army entered, their previous methods were no longer effective. Fourth, they adopted a gentle policy, restraining even their most barbaric actions, giving small favors to prevent the common people from approaching us.

Third Period: That is, the most recent developments: First, they recruited local armed forces with insufficient awareness, bad elements, and wavering loyalties to become traitors. Second, they threatened fence-sitters to stand on their side and become loyal tools of their rule. Third, they used traitors to sow discord everywhere. Fourth, they colluded with local wavering elements, not only exchanging information with them but also including them in their sphere of influence. Fifth, they reached a tacit understanding with actively attacking troops, adopting a non-aggression attitude towards each other. Sixth, they promoted anti-communist movements, such as the recent anti-communist rallies held in Nanjing and Wuhu. Seventh, the enemy recently used Chinese resources to have various factories resume production. In Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi, and other places, Japanese people came forward to open factories, allowing those capitalists with weak national consciousness to open factories and do business, seeking Japanese economic cooperation. In these places, they are implementing the dumping of Japanese goods. In this way, on the one hand, they are developing Chinese resources, and on the other hand, they are using Chinese resources to conduct the Sino-Japanese War. The enemy is launching a political offensive in this direction. Over the past year, the enemy has undergone different changes in military and political terms.

Second, changes in our military and political situation: First, before June, puppet organizations and maintenance societies were universally present in the Jiangnan area, and the Chinese government had very little power. Second, fence-sitters filled various places, occupying a dominant position. Third, the morale of the people in Jiangnan was low. Fourth, since the start of the war of resistance, bandits were prevalent everywhere, running rampant. Fifth, the Big Sword Society, due to the Japanese suppression and the tyranny of the guerrillas, created various obstacles. Sixth, the guerrillas had very bad discipline, desperately fighting each other to seize territory. Precisely because they were fighting each other, they had no power to fight the Japanese. This was the situation before June. Second, after our army entered, the result of several months of fighting and work was: First, except for within enemy strongholds, the puppet regime was universally abolished, and the Chinese government was universally established and restored. Second, fence-sitters disappeared. Third, bad armed units were either disbanded or reorganized. Fourth, we strived to have the Big Sword Society cooperate in combat. Fifth, people's organizations were generally established to a considerable extent. Sixth, the people's anti-Japanese morale has been greatly enhanced. These are the changes after our army entered the Jiangnan area. Third, the future trend is that the struggle situation in Jiangnan is becoming more and more tense, and the struggle is becoming more and more acute. We estimate that the future situation in Jiangnan will have a deeper development. In the more intense and difficult situation of national struggle, if there is no development of a broad mass organization, the partial defection of a few wavering elements is inevitable. Not only should the army and the people cooperate, but the military and the government must be united. To adapt to the more difficult situation in Jiangnan in the future, this is necessary. However, the current situation is that the military and the government are still separated and are even going in opposite directions. This is not suitable for future development and should be corrected urgently.

The Enemy's Military Strengths and Weaknesses

Based on the past year of combat, the enemy's strengths and weaknesses can be divided into the following points: First, the enemy's tactics: First, the enemy's tactics rely on building strongholds everywhere, constructing highways, and reducing our scope of activity. Second, converging attacks, adopting ambushes and encirclements. Third, lightly equipped advances, facilitating rapid movement and surprise attacks. Fourth, adopting ambushes, using roads to ambush our troops. Fifth, adopting concealed actions, easily discovered during the day, operating at night, making our vigilance negligent, and troops vulnerable to attack. They take small roads instead of large roads. Sixth, relying on firepower, using firepower to threaten the enemy and suppress the enemy. Second, the enemy's strengths: First, accurate shooting. Second, good at using terrain and objects to conceal their advance. Third, can swim. Fourth, rapid rescue of wounded and sick soldiers, and quick retrieval of military supplies. Fifth, tenacity. Due to the education of Bushido, the arbitrariness of warlords, and deceitful propaganda, the enemy army has cultivated tenacity in combat. In the past, they would rather die than surrender, but now the degree has decreased and is not as tenacious as before. Sixth, every action meets tactical and combat requirements. Seventh, the officers are very strong, able to control the troops, and can deploy quickly in battle. Eighth, the soldiers have strong obedience, advancing when told to advance, and retreating when told to retreat. They can regroup even after being defeated. Ninth, they have a strong ability to repair transportation routes. Tenth, they are very flexible in their use of tactics, changing them at any time. If they fail today, they will change them tomorrow. Third, the enemy's strategies to deal with us: First, they construct fortifications and build strongholds at all important transportation lines and at bends in the road. Second, they use barbed wire and guard dogs. Small rivers are crossed using movable bridges. Fourth, when marching or transporting, they use small forces to occupy prominent positions first, concealing their advance and searching ahead. Fifth, they frequently change their camping locations. Sixth, they dig trenches and gun holes in the houses they stay in. Seventh, they use waterways for transportation to prevent our attacks. Fourth, the enemy's weaknesses: First, complacency still exists, and vigilance is neglected. Second, they lack an attacking spirit. Third, their movements are clumsy and slow. Fourth, they cannot endure hardship and cannot march long distances. Quick marches and forced marches. Fifth, the failure of using traitors and the uselessness and unreliability of puppet troops.

Experiences and Lessons of People's Movement Work

Over the past year, in the front and in the rear, in order to mobilize the people and strengthen the forces of resistance, in order to achieve army-people cooperation, and with the support and help of the people, we have been able to persist in the struggle in the difficult environment of Jiangnan. Therefore, since the establishment of our army, we have been conducting people's movement work at any time and in any place. Although various objective conditions have prevented us from carrying out people's work according to our own wishes at certain times and stages, or even prevented us from doing people's work at all, such as at the beginning of the establishment of our army, from reorganization to concentration, especially during the concentration stage, we can say that we did not do people's work in order to comply with the orders of our superiors and to avoid many misunderstandings. It was not until after our troops were deployed and started fighting that we began to carry out people's movement work in our own combat areas and around our own troops. Our previous propaganda work was very limited, and it was only at this time that we began to carry it out, not only propagandizing but also moving from propaganda to organization. However, even today, there are still some people who do not understand the importance of people's work, do not understand how to achieve army-people cooperation, and not only cannot develop a superficial people's movement to achieve the development of the national salvation movement, but even do not want to have a people's movement and are jealous of others doing people's movement work. Why do we do people's movement work? For the war of resistance, in order to defeat the enemy, eliminate the enemy, and strive for victory in the war of resistance. From the perspective of the army itself, for the survival of the army, without the people, the army cannot develop, cannot grow, and will be defeated. It is agreed that under the conditions of the comparison of strength in the Sino-Japanese War, our weapons are much worse than the enemy's. Taking our New Fourth Army as an example, our weapons are even worse than those of the general anti-Japanese troops. We rely mainly on the strength and help of the people to confront the superior enemy with such inferior weapons. If there are no people, then we will not only be unable to resist the enemy, but we will also be unable to achieve victory in combat under conditions of great disparity in strength. This explains why we do people's work, why we regard this work and our survival and victory as so important, because the two are inseparable. Our people's movement in the past six months or so can be divided into three parts:

First, the experiences and lessons of the past six months: A. The first experience, which can also be said to be a lesson, is that the army's own practical actions are the basic conditions for gaining the trust and support of the people, and it is the foundation for starting people's movement work. I remember when our army set out from Nanchang, I gave a report to the service corps comrades on the people's movement work in the war zone. I pointed out that the first thing is to use the army's own actions as the foundation for the people's movement, because if we are an army doing people's movement work, we must first have strict discipline in order to gain the trust of the people. We think that this year, especially in the second half of the year, can further prove this point. For example, in the first half of the year, after our army concentrated and advanced towards the war zone, we did not do propaganda work. The work started after the service corps comrades arrived in the war environment and deployed. But why did many people everywhere welcome and trust us, and many people help us, so that our army gained very, very good trust among the people in southern Anhui? Because our army has very good discipline, not only good discipline, but also cherishes the people everywhere and respects the interests of the people everywhere. Therefore, although we did not have much propaganda, we were welcomed everywhere. When our army began to operate in the Jiangnan combat area, because of the Japanese army's propaganda and the propaganda during the domestic war in the past, many people did not understand us. But after our vanguard team went around once, the people of Jiangnan immediately recognized us. When the main force advanced, the people welcomed us everywhere. These facts prove this truth: army discipline is the foundation of people's movement work. The same, conversely, proves that an army with bad discipline will not be trusted by the people, even if it does a lot of propaganda. Many people think that we do not know how much money we have spent on propaganda work, but we feel ashamed of the real propaganda work. It is precisely because of the actions of our army that we can gain the trust of the people, and it is much easier to do people's movement work after that. B. Second, the victory of the battle is a necessary condition for developing people's movement work. Simply doing propaganda without fighting, or fighting badly, the people will say, "It's good, but it's useless!" In short, the reason why we have gained the support of the broad masses of people in Jiangnan and quickly developed people's movement work is largely related to our victories in Jiangnan. This is the second experience and lesson. C. Third, the united front is a prerequisite for carrying out people's movement work. In my last report, I specifically pointed out that everything must go through the united front, and only on the basis of the united front can the people be mobilized. Today we can also prove that wherever the united front is used well, the work can be greatly developed, and wherever it is worse, the work will be worse. D. Going deep among the people is an effective way to mobilize and organize the people. To organize and mobilize, it is not enough to rely on propaganda, nor is it enough to rely on slogans. These effects are very limited. You must go among the people to understand the people, to approach the people, and only on this basis can you organize and mobilize them. It is empty to think of doing people's work by simply standing above the people. We can use our experience to see that those places in the front and rear where we have not gone deep among the people, the work is still insufficient, and the mobilization of the masses cannot be carried out. This is the fourth experience and lesson. E. Fifth, pay attention to the lives of the people. This is the main condition for mobilizing the people to resist Japan, and it can also be said to be a necessary factor. To enable the broad masses of people to participate in the war of resistance, we must pay attention to their livelihood problems. If we do not try to solve their livelihood problems, then we cannot increase their enthusiasm, because this is what they feel firsthand. Let's look at the experience. In those places where this issue has been paid attention to and given a considerable solution, the anti-Japanese sentiment is different. In those places where this issue has not been taken care of, the people's movement is much worse. This is the same not only in the front but also in the rear. But we have one principle: under the highest principle of the war of resistance, we will solve the people's livelihood problem in order to promote the war of resistance, to mobilize the people to enable them to participate in the war of resistance, and to solve the suffering of the people's livelihood in the interests of the war of resistance. This is a principle, and it is also the fifth experience and lesson of our people's movement work in the past six months or so. F. No matter what people's movement, from the beginning of its launch to its continued development and in-depth development, to the consolidation of people's organizations, if many cadres cannot be promoted from among the local people and cadres cannot be trained to lead the work, this people's movement cannot be developed and the people's organization will not be consolidated. Only by promoting and training cadres from among the local people and making these cadres consolidate and strengthen the people's organizations can this be achieved. Without these backbones, it will not work. Those places that have a considerable number of cadres and have their own cadre work, the people's movement must be good. Those places that always ask others to handle it for them will not have much effect. This is an obvious fact. G. Seventh is an experience and lesson we have in terms of methods. Regarding drama and costumed speeches, these are effective methods of rural propaganda. If we have a good drama suitable for the countryside to improve their awareness of the war of resistance, it will be more effective than giving many reports. The general public has not gone to school, so we must pay attention to their level of understanding and adopt various methods. If it is like our report today, the farmers will be dizzy as soon as they hear it. We say that in the experience of fighting, those that are effective in the countryside can be said to be that speeches and slogans do not have much effect, and even artistic pictures do not have much effect. But if it is a costumed speech or a play, it is different. H. Eighth, let's analyze the people's movement work and the mobilization of the people. In those places where there is people's movement work, the mobilization of the people is easier, and those places can adapt to the needs of the war of resistance and reduce the difficulty of mobilization. In all places where there are people's organizations, mobilization is faster. The masses without organizations have insufficient political awareness, and the mobilization force is small. In short, this is a very big weakness in the war of resistance. Why can't the people be mobilized? It is because they are not organized. Therefore, we must do people's movement work, organize the people, and rely on people's organizations to meet the requirements of the war of resistance. (To be continued)

### Guangzhou University President Chen Bingquan Discusses Impressions of Attending the National Education Conference: Conference Highlights Focus on Wartime Education

(Hong Kong Special Dispatch) The representatives from Hong Kong who attended the Third National Education Conference, including Chen Bingquan of Guangzhou University, Li Yinglin of Lingnan University, and Wu Dingxin of National University, have already returned to Hong Kong. President Chen Bingquan of Guangzhou University hosted a reception for the Hong Kong education community at the Swiss Hotel at 6:00 PM on the 28th to report on the conference proceedings. Thirty to forty principals from various schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon attended. During the reception, Mr. Chen delivered a speech reporting on the conference, stating that the atmosphere was exceptionally good. A particular feature of this conference was the special emphasis on wartime education and raising the standards of education in border regions. Mr. Chen continued to say that the government authorities attached great importance to this conference and reported each of the important opinions he had recorded as follows:

Important Opinions: (1) Regarding the opinions of President Chiang, these have already been published in various newspapers and will be omitted. (2) Premier Kong, amidst his busy political affairs, personally attended the conference several times. His opinions on education can be roughly divided into: (A) The purpose of education in the Republic of China is to realize the Three Principles of the People, enrich people's lives, support social survival, develop national livelihoods, and continue the life of the nation. We must strive for national independence, universal civil rights, and the development of people's livelihoods to promote universal harmony. We should proceed earnestly toward this goal. (B) Churches are like power plants, schools are like factories, and factories are like warehouses. Therefore, school education must be based on labor and service, cultivate noble character, a spirit of sacrifice, strong physique, practical knowledge, and productive skills. (C) In addition to school mottos, we should cultivate a good school spirit to make students love themselves and others, cooperate and obey, aspire to do great things, and not aspire to become high officials. (D) Promoting Chinese culture is the greatest mission of education. (E) Education funding has gradually increased from 2% to 4%. Regarding the allocation of funds, attention should be paid to expanding equipment, but thrift should be the principle. (F) The resolutions of the first and second education conferences should be comprehensively reviewed. Which have been implemented, and to what extent? Which have not been implemented, and what are the reasons? (3) Minister Chen was the chairman of the Third National Education Conference and attended almost every meeting, expressing many opinions. In addition to those already published in newspapers, he stated that education should have a purpose, saying that we should take the realization of the Three Principles of the People as the purpose of education. In addition to the grand goal of realizing the Three Principles of the People, schools should have a smaller goal. Generally speaking, we should focus on the cultivation of practical skills. Students should develop special skills based on their individual personalities and environments to solve their own lives. In addition, other important figures such as Zhang Ji, Ju Zheng, Dai Jitao, Wang Chonghui, and He Yingqin also gave many instructions, which shows that the authorities have exceptionally high expectations for the education community.

Education Plan: As for the educational plan for the second phase of the War of Resistance, the following provisions have been made: (A) Secondary Education: (1) Divide school districts. From the 27th year of the Republic (1938), each province will be divided into several secondary school districts. In principle, each district will have a provincial secondary school, and each county will have a county-level junior secondary school. Schools within each district will jointly organize a secondary education research association to study various secondary school issues. (2) Revise the curriculum and standards. Convene experts to revise the hourly standards and the main points of instruction for each subject. The teaching standards promulgated in the 25th year (1936) will still be preserved. (3) Enrich equipment. (A) Establish scientific instrument manufacturing plants to supplement the equipment of various schools. (B) Formulate standards for library equipment for secondary schools at all levels. Schools must meet the minimum standards by the 29th year (1940). (4) Certify and promote teacher training. Hold no-test certification for secondary school teachers. Establish summer vacation training courses and long-term training classes.

Vocational Education: (B) Vocational Education: (1) Divide vocational school districts in border provinces. Starting from the 27th year (1938), divide vocational school districts in border provinces. In addition to establishing practical vocational schools, various vocational training classes will also be organized. The provincial vocational schools in other provinces will have similar training classes attached. (2) Enrich equipment. Formulate equipment standards for agriculture, industry, commerce, and women's domestic affairs, and require all schools to complete their equipment. (3) Formulate curricula and edit textbooks. Formulate curriculum standards for agriculture, industry, commerce, and women's domestic affairs, and edit textbooks within two years. (4) Student practice. Emphasize practice and establish practical production organizations, such as factories, farms, banks, and sewing and catering shops. (5) Teacher training. Designate universities to recruit graduates of senior vocational schools and provide them with four or five years of training, and reward excellent teachers.

Elementary Education: (C) Elementary Education: (1) Promote compulsory education. Short-term elementary schools will be gradually changed to a two-year system, and children's art and crafts classes will be established. (2) Improve elementary education. Compile main points and examples for each subject, organize children's reading materials, compile standard tests, and methods for examining grades. Formulate elementary school equipment standards and organize experimental education committees to guide national experimental education affairs. (D) Overseas Chinese Education: (1) Establish the Overseas Chinese Education Facilities Committee in the first half of the 28th year (1939), which will be organized by personnel from the Ministry of Education, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and relevant central agencies.

Due to their inferior strength, they lost to the Hong Kong inter-city team by 1 to 4, lost to the Chinese United team by 3 to 5, and lost to the Hong Kong United team by 3 to 4. The Philippine team lost all three games in Hong Kong and returned home. The purpose of the Philippine team's visit to Hong Kong for the inter-city match was on the condition that the Hong Kong General Association send a team to Manila in April as a reciprocal visit. The Philippine team has fulfilled the condition to come to Hong Kong to compete, and the date of the Hong Kong team's reciprocal visit is also approaching. At the monthly meeting a few days ago, the General Association resolved that the Hong Kong inter-city team would take the President Cleveland ship leaving Hong Kong on April 28th to the Philippines. The three games in the Philippines will be changed to return to Hong Kong on the Taiping ship. The football association authorities, with the second Hong Kong-Philippines inter-city match approaching, also urgently need to hold the selection of players for the expedition to the Philippines as soon as possible. It is heard that the General Association has selected fifteen Chinese and Western players to be players for the Hong Kong inter-city team. The Philippine Sports Association has expressed its intention to the Hong Kong General Association, requesting that Li Qigai go to the Philippines to perform, so Li Qigai and Da Gaoshan Nu are also on the list of invitees. A total of eleven starters and four substitutes were selected, and a total of seven Chinese generals were selected. However, Lie Li and Kendi of the Navy and Park Jia of the Police Association have given up their right to be selected.

In the first game, the Singapore Chinese team played against the South China Club. In the second game, the General Association decided to send the Hong Kong expedition to the Philippines inter-city team to compete against the Singapore Chinese team, so that the inter-city team can benefit from cooperation, and fans can also watch a more exciting ball game, which is truly a win-win situation.

### Ministry of Foreign Affairs Notifies All Countries: Formal Blockade of Haimen; Aims to Prevent Japanese Troops from Landing; Difficult to Resume Navigation in the Short Term

Before these measures were implemented, emergency relief was temporarily permitted upon the issuance of guarantees, as previously informed by telegram. Now, the review measures for shipping prohibited goods to Shanghai, which could aid the enemy, have been announced and implemented. Hereafter, the shipment of all prohibited goods to Shanghai, within the concession areas, should be handled in accordance with these measures. The emergency relief measures stipulated in the Ministry's previous telegram should be abolished. However, requests to ship bamboo, wood, paper, charcoal, tea, and eggs to Shanghai in transit are exempt from prohibition. Attached is a copy of the review measures for shipping prohibited goods to Shanghai, which could aid the enemy. Please take note. Ministry of Economic Affairs.

Review Measures: Review Measures for Shipping Prohibited Goods to Shanghai. (1) The shipment of prohibited goods to Shanghai is limited to the concession areas. (2) The use of prohibited goods shipped to Shanghai is limited to supply to Chinese or Allied manufacturers or to meet the daily needs of the local population. (3) When Allied manufacturers purchase various prohibited goods from the interior and ship them to Shanghai, before shipment, the chamber of commerce or trade association at the place of shipment and the Allied consulate in Shanghai should issue certificates stating the intended use of the goods in Shanghai, the names and addresses of the Shanghai manufacturers purchasing the goods, and a firm guarantee that the goods will not be used to aid the enemy after being shipped to Shanghai.

Zhejiang Provincial Government Telegram: The Zhejiang Provincial Government telegraphed all counties, stating that it had approved a telegram from Commander Gu Xuan and the Xuan County Government, which stated that the Yu Hang County Self-Defense Corps Committee had telegraphed, stating that it had been reported last October that the Military Affairs Commission had issued an order prohibiting the transportation of bamboo to enemy areas. Now, the bamboo in the northern part of the county is mostly transported to Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places via Sandun, Tangxi, and Pingyao. The committee inquired whether it could be allowed to proceed. Upon investigation, bamboo is a prohibited item designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and Suzhou, Shanghai, and other places are designated prohibited areas. Therefore, the order should be followed and transportation prohibited. The First District Local Products Transportation and Sales Conference previously held by the council stipulated that bamboo, wood, paper, and other items could be exported, which was inappropriate. Now that Yu Hang County has transported bamboo to enemy areas, other counties may inevitably have similar situations.

However, HSBC's listing is eight pence, and the Central Bank's listing is still at one shilling and two and a half pence, with no change.

### General Joffre Enters Dock for Repairs: Guangdong Ship Damaged Severely; Passengers and Cargo May Be Flooded; Company Handling Water Damage Procedures

The British ship Guangdong and the French ship General Joffre collided in the waters between Swatow and Hong Kong due to fog, and both ships were damaged. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to news from the British and French shipping companies in this city, the details of the collision between the two ships are not clear because Shanghai is a branch office. It is only known that both ships have indeed entered docks in Hong Kong for repairs. The General Joffre was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, but this has now been postponed indefinitely and will be determined after the repairs are completed. The British ship Guangdong was damaged more severely than the French ship. It is reported that some seawater has entered the cabin. This time, it loaded more than 800 tons of cargo for export in Shanghai, of which 227 tons were for Hong Kong, 306 tons were for Singapore, and the rest were for Europe.

### Overseas Chinese Enthusiastically Support the Motherland's Resistance Against Japan; Business Community Invests in the Development of the Southwest; Youth Abandon Their Careers and Return Home to Serve

Since our country launched the national resistance against Japan, all Chinese people, without exception, have been united against the enemy, and are striving for victory with a spirit of spiritual unity. Overseas compatriots are even more enthusiastic about their motherland. In addition to remitting large amounts of materials back to the country and contributing to the government to increase the strength of the resistance against Japan, they are also investing in the development of the rich resources in the southwest. Many young people have returned home to serve. This enthusiastic spirit of supporting the resistance against Japan is a sign that the final victory will surely belong to us. The following are reports from the Modern News Agency reporter stationed in Yunnan:

Organizing Engineering Teams to Return Home to Serve: In order to support the motherland's resistance against Japan and strive for final victory, overseas Chinese in Singapore have recently organized a Machine Engineering Return Home Service Team. Led by General Leader Shen Daicheng, Head Wang Yousong, and Deputy Head Huang Youyi, a group of 35 people arrived in Yunnan on the 22nd and will soon transfer to Chongqing to request work assignments from the authorities. The team members have excellent careers in Singapore, and their decision to abandon their careers and return to serve the motherland is truly commendable.

Investing in the Development of Industries in the Southwest: The Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Industrial Company is organized by our overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. It has many branches in the Dutch East Indies, the Malay Peninsula, and other places, and has factories operating rubber and other industries. Now, the company feels that the industries of the motherland's resistance against Japan urgently need development, so it has established four branches in Kunming, Chongqing, Guiyang, and Shanghai, and plans to first handle import and export trade. Once it has established a foothold in the local area, it will begin to engage in industrial and mining businesses.

### The Agreement Between the Two Concession Courts Is Extended Indefinitely; Both Parties Agree That It Should Continue to Be Valid

The Agreement on the Chinese Court in the Shanghai International Settlement was signed on February 17, 1930, and expired on March 31, 1933. The Agreement on the Chinese Court in the Shanghai French Concession was signed on July 28, 1931, and expired on March 31, 1933. After the expiration of the above two concession court agreements, with the consent of both parties, they were extended for three years. After the three-year extension period expires, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Britain, the United States, France, Brazil, Norway, and the Chinese governments separately notified each other with their consent, and they were extended indefinitely. However, if revisions are desired, either party should notify the other six months in advance, and we will definitely be effective. Therefore, although it is now March 31, 1939, because the agreement has been extended indefinitely with the consent of both parties, and neither party has notified revisions in accordance with the regulations, the agreement should continue to be valid.

The Times: Yesterday (30th), a court authority spokesman told reporters that the Chinese special district courts in the two foreign municipal areas and the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court will continue to operate as before in accordance with the subsidiary conditions of the agreements signed between the Chinese government and the relevant foreign countries. The rumors published in the local newspapers that the agreement will expire on April 1st of this year are absolutely unfounded. These rumors are due to ignorance of the

True Conditions: The National Government's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dr. Luo Wengcan established an agreement between China and relevant countries during his tenure in 1933, stipulating that if the signing party does not notify the other party six months in advance that it wishes to establish a new agreement, then the Chinese special district courts and the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court in Shanghai will continue to operate indefinitely. Since neither of the signing parties has expressed any intention to establish a new agreement, and no notification has been issued before, the Chinese courts in this city will continue to operate as before, so the Chinese court

Sovereignty Is Not Impaired: As in the past, the Chinese court authorities have not recognized or accepted any foreign influence that attempts to modify the Sino-foreign agreement. The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Concession Council have also received copies of the agreement annexes, and formally recognized the National Government as an effective signer in 1933. Therefore, the Chinese court authorities in this city will strictly abide by the provisions of the Sino-foreign agreement, pending instructions from the Chongqing Central Government, and will continue to operate as before. All rumors to the contrary can be ignored because they are all unfounded, etc. Yesterday, the reporter inquired to a certain

Senior Personnel: of the Municipal Council about the matter of the "Shanghai Mayor" Chuan Xiaohuan's envoy to the Municipal Council last Wednesday. It is said that the document has been delivered to the personnel of the Municipal Council. The member mentioned the jurisdiction of the Special First Court and the Jiangsu Higher Court, saying that the Municipal Council has no right to make any decision on this matter. The Court Agreement was signed in 1933 by the Chinese government and foreign representatives, however, it will not expire until April 1st because the signers have not issued a notice of cancellation, therefore, the agreement will automatically

Continue for Three Years: Also, the Mainland Report says that last night, it was learned from the security aspect that the Municipal Council personnel had not yet started researching Chuan Xiaohuan's envoy. It is heard that the reason is because the formal translation of the document was only completed yesterday. However, copies of the document will be distributed to the bureau personnel this morning (31st). Last night, a Municipal Council spokesman said that once the translation of the document is distributed, research will begin immediately.

### Guerrilla Attack on Japanese Airstrip

The Dajang Japanese airfield, which took several months to build and cost more than one million yuan, covering an area of ​​more than two hundred acres, was recently completed last month. There were two army planes parked inside. The Japanese garrison was attacked by guerrillas on the evening of the 29th. The Japanese security team at the airfield heard the alarm, panicked, and fled without being able to resist, abandoning their weapons. Several Japanese soldiers were killed, and a Japanese plane was shot down.

Japanese Troops Ambushed in Xiaotang: After the Japanese troops in Xiaotang, Fengxian County, were attacked by the guerrilla regiment of Li Zhiming's troops, more than half were annihilated. After receiving the report, the Japanese headquarters immediately dispatched the Japanese troops stationed in Minhang to reinforce the area. Yesterday (30th), the troops were ambushed by Li's guerrilla troops at a Shuqiaotou several miles outside of Xiaotang. Suddenly, gunshots rang out and hand grenades exploded. The Japanese troops were caught off guard and suffered heavy casualties. After several desperate guards were killed, they retreated in a panic. The remaining enemies surrounded in Xiaotang will be wiped out soon.

Tension Along the Shanghai-Minhang Line: The Shanghai-Minhang Highway is a vital thoroughfare connecting Jinghang. Since the regular troops of the Central Army advanced towards the highway, the Japanese have been extremely panicked. In addition to setting up defensive works at key transportation points, they have also mobilized the stationed troops along the Shanghai-Minhang Highway and concentrated them at Beiqiao. That place is the main place to control the Shangsong Highway and connect to South Pu. For this reason, the soldiers car is crowded with vehicles, which is nervous, and the villagers are all in fear all day long.

### Wounded Officers and Soldiers Return to the Front Line to Form Honor Battalions; The Disabled Will Be Cared for for Life or Engage in Production; Conscripts in Various Provinces Enthusiastically Participate in New Recruit Training

The military authorities are providing excellent post-war care for wounded officers and soldiers. The disabled are provided with life-long care for first-class disabilities. Second and third-class disabilities will be given the opportunity to engage in land reclamation, animal husbandry, gold mining, and light industry, according to their aptitude and ability, in order to increase production and increase the strength of the resistance against Japan. In addition, wounded officers and soldiers in rear hospitals, after recovering, all request to continue to return to the front line to serve the country. The military authorities commend their enthusiasm and form them into honor battalions to return to the front line. In addition, conscripts in various provinces, cities, and counties are enthusiastically participating in new recruit training, so the replenishment of soldiers is very sufficient.

### New York Times Correspondent in China  Denounces Japanese Spies; Acknowledges the Rudest and Most Ignorant Organization is the Japanese Military Officer Corps

The Mainland Press reports that the editorial of the upcoming (1st) issue of the *China Weekly Review* states that the New York Times correspondent in China, Mr. Hallett Abend, recently exposed Japan's espionage system and denounced the Japanese military's Special Service Department's Kempeitai (military police) as the rudest, most ignorant, and ineptly operated armed force of its kind in the world. Mr. Abend also cited numerous Japanese military officers who admitted that his denunciations were accurate, causing the Japanese military permanent embarrassment. According to Mr. Abend, the phrase "Japanese spies," once a nationwide joke in the United States, is no longer a laughing matter, as most of China's coastal provinces and major cities have already been occupied by invaders.  Between Chinese and Japanese, the threat of espionage has evolved into an unspoken terror, and among foreigners, the frantic activities of these detectives are somewhat annoying and no longer a laughing matter. Mr. Abend believes that, apart from a few high-ranking Japanese, no one knows the details of the Japanese espionage organization and the scope of activities of the so-called Kempeitai. Mr. Abend also described the predicament many foreigners face when traveling in Japan due to spies and the Kempeitai.  He concluded that Japanese Consul General Hioki acknowledged that the Japanese Kempeitai and spies are mostly organized by rude, ignorant, and incompetent individuals.

### Fallen Areas: Bandits Everywhere; Residents are Filled with Grievances

Since the retreat of the National Army, bandits are everywhere in the fallen areas (now renamed guerrilla areas), committing all kinds of atrocities. Moreover, most of these bandits are local natives who are very familiar with the local situation. Residents with even a little wealth are repeatedly subjected to their exploitation. The puppet police and Japanese soldiers turn a blind eye and deaf ear, causing residents to complain endlessly. If this continues, there will be no survivors left.

### Taiping Bridge Town, Suzhou: Puppet Troops Loot; Originally the Gang of Bandit Leader Cao Zhangjing; Robbing Grain and Kidnapping for Ransom

Cao Zhangjing's unit of the Suzhou puppet "Pacification Army" was originally a gang of long-time bandits from Xiangcheng, possessing more than 300 firearms.  On March 5th, they surrendered to the puppet army's "4th District Commander" in Dongtang Township, Changshu.  The Japanese military inspected the firearms and issued them more than 100 weapons to serve as their lackeys. On March 21st, this puppet army suddenly arrived at Taiping Bridge Town in northeastern Suzhou, claiming to be searching for guerrillas, but in reality, they were looting house by house. They transported away all the grain. Furthermore, wealthy individuals from the town, such as Shen Enlin and Hua Meifeng, were also kidnapped for ransom.

### Charity Society Collects 60,000 Abandoned Corpses in One Year

According to the French-language *Journal de Shanghai*, the Shanghai Charity Society at 210 North Sea Road in this city specializes in burying abandoned corpses found on the roads as its charitable work. In the past year alone, it has buried 60,000 corpses found on the roads. It is now reported that its funds are exhausted. The Wusong branch of the Jianghai Customs, which has been occupied by the Japanese military for more than a year, has, after repeated negotiations, officially resumed its customs inspection duties from the previous day. However, the buildings of the Wusong branch are still forcibly occupied and garrisoned by the Japanese military, and have not yet been returned. Therefore, all Chinese and foreign customs officers have to conduct their work on customs patrol vessels. But in reality, when performing their duties, there are still various difficulties and obstacles. The Japanese military in Wusong also from time to time arbitrarily release vessels awaiting inspection, resulting in the malpractices of smuggling and tax evasion, which continue unabated. Upon hearing this report, Mr. Lofthouse, the British Tax Commissioner, has again made two demands to the Japanese side, requesting that they stop the Japanese military's unreasonable interference in the administrative work of the branch and that the original buildings of the Wusong branch be quickly returned within the shortest possible time for office use and to facilitate the exercise of its functions.

### This Newspaper Continues to Present Benevolence Medals; Presented in front of the Donation Stand at the Sun Sun Department Store from Today Until Children's Day

This newspaper, in cooperation with the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, specially produced 170,000 "Benevolence is the Greatest Joy" badges a month ago and donated them to the association.  The association's education group then initiated a campaign, asking students in all schools in Shanghai to solicit donations from their parents for the production and education of refugee children.  Anyone who donated one yuan would receive a "Benevolence is the Greatest Joy" badge from this newspaper as a souvenir. At that time, all the students mobilized, and people from all walks of life eagerly contributed. As a result, in less than two weeks, more than 100,000 yuan was raised, which can be considered a special achievement. It also demonstrates that people from all walks of life are deeply concerned about the happiness and future of refugee children. The association has now announced the end of the "Benevolence is the Greatest Joy" badge donation campaign and will publish an accounting of the funds raised by each school as soon as possible. It will also return the remaining 40,000-plus badges to this newspaper for other fundraising purposes. This newspaper, because the 8th Children's Day is approaching soon, and in past years this newspaper has published children's publications such as "Children's Friend," which were dedicated to promoting the three aspects of children's education: moral, intellectual, and physical, and were popular for a time, believes that during this time of national crisis, relieving refugee children is a matter that brooks no delay. Therefore, from today until the 4th, Children's Day, this newspaper and the Sun Sun Department Store on Nanjing Road are jointly holding a continuation of the "Benevolence is the Greatest Joy" badge presentation. The Sun Sun Department Store has specially built a donation stand inside the store. Benevolent ladies and gentlemen who wish to create happiness for refugee children can go to the donation stand at the store during these four days and donate as they wish. Anyone who donates 20 cents will receive a "Benevolence is the Greatest Joy" badge; the more you donate, the more badges you will receive, until they are all given out. The funds will be given to the Refugee Relief Association in their entirety for the relief of refugee children. It is hoped that families with good circumstances can have their children assist in this act of kindness, so as to cultivate in them the virtue of enjoying doing good deeds and having a benevolent heart, which is indeed the fortune of society and the nation.

### French Concession Health Department to Hold Large-Scale Epidemic Prevention This Summer; Last Year's Mass Vaccination Results Were Excellent

The Shanghai Pasteur Institute and the French Concession Health Department have investigated the results obtained from last year's epidemic prevention campaign. The following is a summary of the conclusions of the report submitted to the Far Eastern Congress of Tropical Medicine in Hanoi last November.

(1) In this city of over one million people, when cholera was at its most rampant, the number of cholera patients never exceeded the globally recognized average. Last year, when cholera was most prevalent, the daily average number of cholera patients did not exceed 41. The morbidity rate per 1,000 people was only 2 to 3, and the mortality rate was 0.02 to 0.03.

(2) The morbidity rate for the masses who received a single injection, and for the small number of people who received two injections within ten days according to medically appropriate methods, was almost zero.

(3) For those who had been vaccinated against cholera, but unfortunately still contracted the disease, the severity of the illness was greatly reduced, and the mortality rate was three to four times lower than those who had not been vaccinated.

Therefore, the results obtained in Shanghai are sufficient to prove that previous observations were correct. For example:

During the European Great War of 1916, when the Romanian army crossed the Danube again, they were infected with cholera by the displaced masses. Mass vaccinations were immediately carried out. Their doctor, Gangda Gusen, recorded the following:

The results of the vaccination were excellent. The danger of cholera spread by refugees from the Dobrogea region was completely extinguished within a few days. In the following weeks, although there were still cholera patients in Moldavia, the disease was immediately eliminated by isolating the patients and carrying out mass vaccinations on the local population.

The French Concession Health Department plans to carry out the same mass vaccination this year. If residents can cooperate fully, their goal will definitely be achieved. Therefore, to prevent cholera, attention must be paid to:

### Large Group of Japanese Soldiers Searches Qibao

After Qibao Township in western Shanghai was recovered by the 2nd Battalion of the Directly Subordinate Force of the Loyal National Salvation Army under Yao Youlian, the merchants and residents of the town once again saw the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. However, at 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, a large group of more than 200 Japanese and puppet troops suddenly attacked from three directions: Sijing, Xinzhuang, and Hongqiao. Xu, the company commander of Yao's unit stationed in the town, had already learned of this, and because of the disparity in strength, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifice, he led his troops to retreat to the nearby countryside. After the Japanese troops arrived in the town, they immediately declared martial law, cut off traffic, set up machine guns at the entrances of various streets and alleys, and assigned sentries to guard them. The situation was serious, as if facing a major enemy. They then searched the shops and residences, but found nothing. It was not until about 5:00 PM that they returned in formation. They came again at 10:00 AM yesterday, but the situation was more relaxed than before. Several villagers were severely beaten by the Japanese soldiers for not carrying their citizen ID cards. They were only released after various shops provided guarantees. At around 3:00 PM in the afternoon, the Japanese and puppet troops still retreated to their original defenses in three directions.

### British Cruiser Arrives in Shanghai for Stationing

According to the English-language *China Press*, the British light cruiser HMS Cardiff arrived in Shanghai from Weihaiwei last night (30th) and berthed at the British naval pontoon, replacing the British warship HMS Duncansby, which left Shanghai for Weihaiwei a few hours earlier. Sixty-eight selected British naval personnel of all ranks arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong by ship yesterday. About half of them boarded HMS Duncansby before the ship weighed anchor, and the rest boarded HMS Cardiff last night.

### Cholera Prevention

Cholera is a gastrointestinal disease. If the normal function of the digestive organs is disturbed, it provides an opportunity for bacteria to develop, and cholera occurs as a result. Therefore, when the disease is about to occur, absolute attention must be paid to food hygiene. Do not drink unclean water; it is best to boil it before drinking. Do not drink excessive or excessively cold liquids, as they can damage the antiseptic effect of gastric secretions. Do not eat raw vegetables or fruits that have not been disinfected by soaking them in potassium permanganate solution for a long time. Do not eat fruits that have been cut open and sold, or food that has been prepared for a long time or has spoiled. Pay attention to your own cleanliness and that of your neighbors, as cholera is transmitted by unclean hands. Also pay attention to the cleanliness of your own house and neighborhood, as various dust and garbage can allow flies to breed, and flies will transmit cholera bacteria everywhere. In addition, you should also get a cholera vaccination.

### Rumor Spreads That Commander Xiong Jiandong of the Six-County Guerrilla Force Has Been Killed; After Being Arrested by a Certain Party, He Was Coerced and Enticed; Xiong Displayed Valor and Righteousness and Gave His Life Generously

Xiong Jiandong, commander of the guerrilla forces of the six counties of Qin, Tai, Jia, Song, Jin, and Qing under the Special Operations Corps of the Chinese Military Commission, after being appointed, led his troops to station themselves in the Jiangnan area. His soldiers were all elite and good at fighting, invincible in all directions, traveling thousands of miles, and repeatedly inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese military. Therefore, those who plotted against him became increasingly desperate. A month ago, when Xiong came to Shanghai for some important business, the secrecy was extremely tight; even Xiong's closest friends did not know his whereabouts. But he was betrayed by some unscrupulous, insane elements who were in league with a certain party, who discovered everything about Xiong and then devised a way to deceive him. At that time, Xiong trusted them completely because they were all trusted confidants, and so he was lured and arrested, and there was no news of him. Later, there was once a rumor that Xiong would be released soon, but soon the facts proved that this rumor was absurd and unfounded. According to reliable sources yesterday, it was reported that Xiong had been killed in Hongkou the day after his arrest. At that time, the other party had repeatedly tried to entice and coerce him, but all were firmly rejected by Xiong. Even when tortured, he remained brave and unyielding. The other party, running out of tricks, killed him. However, Xiong regarded death as returning home, calmly went to his death, and shouted "Long live the nation!" and died with a smile. Since hearing this shocking news, all circles have mourned in unison, calling Xiong a model of a modern revolutionary soldier.

### Chinese in Yantai Banned from Entering French Churches; It is Suspected That the Church is Conducting Anti-Japanese Propaganda; Printing Workers Were Sentenced to Death

According to the English-language *China Press*, citing the French-language *Journal de Shanghai*, Chinese people in Yantai have been banned from entering French churches there since March 23 because the police suspected that the church was conducting anti-Japanese propaganda and took this action. Furthermore, printing workers at the church were accused of printing anti-Japanese leaflets and were sentenced to death. The puppet government in Yantai, assisted by the Japanese military, searched house to house in the city, as they believed that a large number of guerrillas were living there. More than 300 Chinese people suspected of being guerrillas were arrested.

### Police Search for Bandits and Discover One Japanese; Handed Over to Japanese Military Police

According to the Mainland Press, responsible sources reported last night (30th) that a team of searchers from the Public Concession Police Department searched a room in a New World Hotel on Yu Zhiqing Road yesterday afternoon in search of bandits. They were slightly surprised to find two Chinese and one Japanese there. But the constables still carried out their duties and began to search the three men. The Japanese man refused to be searched and called the Japanese Military Police headquarters. Soon, Japanese military police arrived, and the constables handed the Japanese man over to them. It is said that the two Chinese were searched, but they were released. As of last night, it was still not known for sure.

### A Gambler Ruined by Gambling; Fiancé Willing to Engage in Degrading Behavior; Taken to Court by His Future In-Laws; Acquitted Due to Insufficient Evidence

Gu Zheng Hong (age 33), a doctor from Huzhou residing at 60 Xiafei Road in the French Concession, became engaged to Yin Rongqiu, a woman from Hubei currently residing at 37 Yinhua Lane, Robert Dollar Road, in the Public Concession, in March 1938. Because Dr. Gu often went to gambling dens in Caojiadu to gamble, he pawned his jewelry and clothes and lost everything to the gambling den. When Ms. Yin's parents learned of this, they were very dissatisfied with this fiancé. With Ms. Rongqiu's consent, they retained a lawyer to send a letter to Gu Zheng Hong, stating that his character was base and he was willing to engage in degrading behavior and ruined his family through gambling. They intended to submit a petition to the First Special District Court to dissolve the engagement. After receiving the letter, Gu had several quarrels with the woman's parents, and so far the engagement has not been formally dissolved. Unexpectedly, at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon, Gu Zheng Hong went to Yinhua Lane, Robert Dollar Road, and happened to meet Ms. Yin and her mother, Yin Wei, and they had a big argument and dispersed. After a while, the mother and daughter reported to the Putuo Road police station, accusing their fiancé, Dr. Gu, of snatching Ms. Yin's gold ring worth 34 yuan, etc. At about 7:00 PM in the evening, the woman's father, Yin Zonglian, grabbed Gu on Robert Dollar Road and called a Chinese constable from No. 3185 to take him to the police station for detention. This morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, explained the case, saying that the defendant had confessed to snatching Ms. Yin's gold ring at the police station. However, among the pawn tickets found on him, there was no ticket for this gold ring, etc. Then Ms. Yin and her parents testified again and questioned the defendant, who firmly denied the charges. Judge Jiang Shuzi, believing that the evidence in this case was insufficient and the circumstances were complicated, declared Gu Zheng Hong not guilty and released him in court.

### Three Convicted of Robbing Pan Sansheng's House

Pi Bingzhang, a Chinese detective in the Xinzha police station, previously arrested three bandits, Li Yutang, Zhang Yixian, and Tang Abao, and found that they were related to the robbery of more than 20,000 yuan from Pan Sansheng's house at No. 10, Lane 126, Kainar Road, and 1,500 yuan from Lu Gongqing's house at No. 10, Lane 51, Xintangjia Lane. They were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. This morning, Judge Xiao sentenced Li Yutang and Tang Abao to ten years in prison each, and Zhang Yixian to seven years in prison. Because Li and Tang were involved in another case in the French Concession, they were ordered to be transferred to the Special Court for interrogation.

### Daughter-in-Law Accuses Mother-in-Law of Theft; Police Find Large Quantities of Xiangyunsha Silk; Five Suspects Arrested and Sent to Court for Review

Wang Dazhong, a foreman at the French-owned Electric Power Company, lived at No. 1, Sanxing Lane, Rue du Père Huc. His wife had passed away early, and he cohabited with Chen Lian Gui (35 years old) from Huzhou. They had a daughter, now 11 years old. Wang's first wife had a son, who was now 30 years old. He also worked as a coppersmith at the Electric Power Company and had married a local woman, Jin (25 years old). The whole family lived together. There were often disputes within the family. Unexpectedly, Wang Dazhong died suddenly of illness on the second day of the first lunar month this year. Chen Lian Gui lost her support, and the relationship between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law often led to quarrels, to the point where they were irreconcilable. On the 28th of this month, Chen suddenly led two people and took advantage of the fact that no one was home to move 18 bolts of Xiangyunsha silk, 400 yuan in cash, a white leather suitcase, and a radio set that were stored in the house. On the 30th, she went to move more items and was discovered by her daughter-in-law, Wang Jin, who reported it to the French police station, accusing Chen and others of theft. After receiving the report, the police ordered detectives to arrest Chen Lian Gui, Chen Arong (28 years old, from Ningbo), who ran a coal store at No. 79 Kangti Road, Sun Liangkui (30 years old, from Chongde), who ran a coal store at No. 50 Pei Shao Nai Road, Yu Yonggen (29 years old, from Changzhou), the owner of a engraving shop at No. 57 Rue Brenier, and Song Shuxiang (26 years old, from Henan), the owner of a teahouse at No. 152 Kangti Road.

### Huge Shipment of Padded Clothing from Pudong to Shanghai; Confiscated by Japanese Military; Several Thousand Dan in Total, of Considerable Value; Local Landlords Report Economic Panic

Since the Chinese army withdrew to the west, the economy of Pudong has relied entirely on the adjustment of agricultural products such as cotton, rice, and wheat. Recently, the Yuanxingde, Xiangshun, and Hemao cotton ginning factories in Daduan, Zhoupu, Zhangjiangzha, and other places ginned cotton into padded clothing and transported it to Shanghai. When they arrived at Baiyunjing Port, they were intercepted and confiscated by the Japanese military. There were thousands of dan in total, worth hundreds of thousands of yuan. The Pudong economy is in a state of panic. It has been found that the above-mentioned "passes" for the cotton transported from the interior were all issued by Inoue, the Japanese instructor in Chuansha, for a large sum of money. Therefore, after being confiscated, when they negotiated with Inoue, he refused to take responsibility. Last year, the Pudong cotton was once attempted to be controlled by Yun Jiusheng and others, but it was not completely successful. This time, the arbitrary detention and confiscation is rumored to be due to the uneven distribution of expenses. However, the people are suffering.

### International Race Club's New Venue Opens Today; "Gymkhana" Race Scheduled for April 16; Members and Non-Members May Register to Participate

It is said that the venue recently arranged by the International Race Club is scheduled to open on the afternoon of April 1 (Saturday) at 2:00 PM for the use of the club's members. The venue is located at 181 Hongqiao Road, not far opposite Zhongshan Road. It is a five-minute car ride from the last French soldier post on Hongqiao Road. Transportation is very convenient. Inside the venue are three tracks surrounding the lawn, where spectators can stand and have an unobstructed view of the races. There is also a building with a bar inside. In addition to the main entrance leading to the lawn and the building, there is another entrance on Hongqiao Road dedicated to the entry and exit of horses and grooms. There is also a door leading directly to the fields, so that riders can avoid the inconvenience of going around the avenue. All club members holding a 1939 pass can enter the venue after presenting it. However, the obstacle course is only for members who have paid a special membership fee and wear enamel badges. If the weather is fine, the venue is scheduled to officially open on April 16 (Sunday). At that time, the International Race Club will hold a "Gymkhana" style horse race. The order is as follows: (1) Single Pony Jumping Race. The height of the participating ponies must not exceed 14 hands. If the height of the horse exceeds the limit by no more than one inch, it will not be counted. This competition is open to both male and female members and non-members. (2) Mixed Male and Female Horse Jumping Race. Each group has one male and one female. The competition group and conditions are the same as in the first event. (3) Various Games. Professional riders are not allowed to participate in the day's competitions. There is no charge for those who register to participate. The registration deadline is noon on Tuesday, April 11. Those who wish to participate in the first and second events are requested to send their names to Mr. Cadant, secretary of the club, at the French Consulate General, or Mr. Arnold of Butterfield & Swire, and must state the name of the horse, the height of the horse, and the name of the horse owner. As for those participating in the games, please contact the venue. The authorities at the Yu Garden were willing to lend their lawn to the club for use, but because this year is the time for lawn repair, it could not be fulfilled as desired. Therefore, it is not possible to organize a race in the spring as it was on November 20 last year. The "Gymkhana" race on April 16 cannot be regarded as equivalent to a formal horse race, but the club is very willing to choose a date to re-perform these simple games to entertain the audience. Although the form of the horse race is simpler, its interest and elegance are not diminished as a result.

### Spring Poem (1)

Long a sojourner on Shanghai's shore,

Clothed and fed, yet ever in need;

Youthful days swiftly passing by;

Vitality fading year by year.

My wife's beauty rivals the flowers,

Yet distance keeps us apart, uncherished,

Now I take Bu Ti Kang to restore my frame,

And our deep affection shall surely remain!

Statement: The poetry and prose mix of advertising was pioneered by Mu Xing.

See previous "Spring Boudoir Lament"

Based on daily experience, it is known that there are two major reasons for the consumption of human energy: one is self-indulgence and debauchery, and the other is excessive and complicated work. The former is a bad habit often fallen into by young people who do not cherish themselves, and the latter is unavoidable for young people who work hard. Living on this isolated island with the highest standard of living, we feel the pressure of life and the panic of economic hardship, and we have to strive to solve our livelihood problems. Because of the excessive mental exertion, the nerves gradually weaken, resulting in neurasthenia, which is common.

After neurasthenia, seminal emission is unavoidable. If it occurs too frequently and for too long, the scope of weakness will gradually extend to sexual function, leading to premature ejaculation and kidney deficiency, and the joy of youth will be completely lost!

To thoroughly understand the origin of sexual dysfunction, the aforementioned self-indulgence and debauchery are also major causes of this condition, and the principle is the same as undertaking excessive labor. The function of sexual organs cannot be neglected nor indulged in; neglect and indulgence are both harmful, but the harm from indulgence is greater. Therefore, after indulgence, the youth glands are greatly weakened, and love is difficult to generate during sexual intimacy. Women with weak temperaments will inevitably divorce their husbands, and feel that their lonely and miserable lives are dull. Therefore, for the sake of happiness, early treatment is the best course. If you do not follow the doctor's instructions and indiscriminately take aphrodisiacs on the market, as well as "tonics" similar to aphrodisiacs, not only will they have no effect, but they will also worsen the condition. Only after taking the German genuine and potent animal testicular essence preparation for men, "Bu Ti Kang," can energy be revitalized and sexual function invigorated in a very short period of time, promoting metabolic function and instantly curing symptoms such as insomnia, forgetfulness, back pain, loss of appetite, premature ejaculation, nocturnal emission, impotence, and infertility. Those who usually feel neurasthenia will become energetic. Couples whose love has faded will also reconcile as before. This is why "Bu Ti Kang" is highly respected by both the medical and pharmaceutical fields, far beyond what inferior drugs can compare with. The female "Bu Ti Kang" can promote breast development and regulate menstruation, with miraculous effects. Yang Daonan, graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University.

### Rifts in the Berlin-Rome Axis

— Mao Lie

To say that the Berlin-Rome Axis is about to break is, of course, premature. However, I say that the Berlin-Rome Axis already has cracks, which is an undeniable fact. We might as well use a few recent events to prove the existence of these cracks:

Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, and Italy did not send a congratulatory telegram, this is the first. Germany demanded commercial rights from Yugoslavia, but Mussolini's speech asserted Italy's control in the Adriatic Sea, this is the second. Italy made demands on France, and although Germany volunteered to be the backing, Italy no longer put forward the cession demands of Nice, Savoy, and Corsica, but only raised the transportation issues of the Strait of Gibraltar and the Suez Canal, as well as the treatment of Italians in Tunisia, this is the third...

In addition, Germany annexed Austria, and the German and Italian territories were connected, causing Italy to feel threatened; Germany monopolized Romania's economic interests, excluding Italy;... All of this shows that Germany's power is unparalleled, while Italy is confined to a corner, unable to catch up. Italy's outward development and striving to be the best are certainly things that should be done, but to say that she has no desire to compete with Germany and is willing to be subservient at Germany's feet is not necessarily true.

This is just talking about the present; if Hitler's ability to settle old scores is indeed accurate, he must still be able to calculate these two things: first, during the European War, Italy was originally an ally of Germany and Austria, but later joined the Entente halfway, weakening the power of the Allied powers and causing Germany and Austria to collapse faster; second, at the end of the European War, Italy annexed several Austrian territories, and even now, there are still hundreds of thousands of Germans in these places. If Hitler, in his interest in settling old scores, calculates these two accounts again, what will be the result? Italy betrayed the alliance in the past, and how can it be guaranteed that it will not betray the Axis now or in the near future and join the democratic front?

The old cracks are deep, and new cracks continue to appear. The reason why this axis can still be maintained is only because they still have some intention of using each other. If there is only one-sided use; if the democratic front is tightly knit, making it impossible for them to use each other; if the divisive effect of Britain and France is still as effective as it was during the European War, then this axis will break immediately, not just adding some cracks.

Now, the time of breaking seems to be still very early; but the world is ever-changing, who can say for sure; in addition, if it is attacked day by day, it will eventually break quickly one day!

### Sudden Change

— Jin Ge

"Hum——"! Airplanes kept circling in the sky above. From time to time, there were also "Boom! Boom!" sounds of bombs, followed by the sound of houses collapsing, a chaotic mess.

Everyone uneasily climbed out of their dog-kennel-like quilts and squeezed to the door, vying to look out through the five-inch square hole. The corridor was dark and gloomy, and even the prison guards who usually shouted and yelled were nowhere to be seen.

"Where are they! Where are they! Bastards! Where did you crawl into that tortoise hole! In the past, shouting and yelling, it was all your world, now you can slip away? Damn it!" The robber A Xu slammed the door fiercely.

"I heard from Gou Er (prison guard) that the fighting outside has been fierce these past few days, not far from here! What to do!" The thief Wang Awan said worriedly to himself.

"Hum——! Boom! Boom!" Airplanes were dropping bombs again.

"Amitabha, bombs have eyes, don't drop them here! Spare this old dog's life! Alas! Alas!" The opium dealer Shi Lao Si said crying, then put his head back into the quilt.

"If you're going to be bombed, then bomb to death you kind of thieves who do things that kill people without spilling blood! I, A Xu, fight with guns, straightforwardly, white knife in, red knife out! If you're going to die, you die, do you have this kind of spirit? Ur!" A Xu said fiercely.

"I die, see if you don't die. Alas, alas!" Shi Lao Si crawled out of the quilt, but shrank back in again.

"You say it! You say it! I'll beat you to death first." A Xu wanted to rush over and start fighting, but Wang A Cai and another thief, Ma Xin Gen, held him back.

"Old brother, why bother arguing with this old man!" Wang A Cai persuaded A Xu, and then turned back to Ma Xin Gen and said, "Gou Er also said that the higher-ups are going to release us!"

"I'm not afraid of death! But if I'm going to die, I have to die quickly, fight with the Japanese devils, die with face, if I'm going to be bombed to death in prison by the Japanese soldiers in a muddle, what words will I use to explain to Yama, and my fierce and ruthless father?" A Xu muttered to himself, then he slammed the door again, scolding, "Bastards! Open the door!"

Suddenly, a burst of hurried footsteps came from the corridor. A Xu looked out from the hole and saw Gou Er leading the way, followed by seven or eight soldiers, walking over. He couldn't help but burst into scolding, "Bastard, you're here! I thought you drowned in the tortoise hole! Open the door, let me go fight with the Japanese devils!" After saying that, he slammed the door fiercely again.

"Don't make trouble: don't make trouble! The warden is here to release you dogs!"

Gou Er said this loudly, and almost every prison cell heard it clearly. The prisoners were so happy they couldn't close their mouths! Everyone was busy, anxious.

After a while, the warden came. Followed by several soldiers.

"Number fifteen, sixteen; number thirty..." The warden read from the book, Gou Er opened the chains, and Chen Liangcai counted the people.

More than a thousand prisoners filled the entire corridor. The warden stood on a stool at the exit and said loudly, "The war outside is very urgent, and the enemy is not far from here. I have received orders to release you! Some of you have been here for ten or twenty years, some for three or five years, and everyone has been living in accordance with the rules. The country has not treated you badly either. Now that you are released, I hope that after you get out of prison, you can reform and start anew, and not commit crimes again! Be a good person! Be worthy of the country and your ancestors! Alright! Go! Don't push when you go out, don't be chaotic, don't crowd together, the enemy's planes will see you and drop bombs!"

Ah! More than a thousand cheers came from the bottom of their hearts, and then everyone started to move their feet. Just then, A Xu took a step forward and said loudly:

"Wait a minute! I, A Xu, also have a few words to say: I, A Xu, used to be a robber! Black guns, white knives, red blood, I've played with them all. I should have died dozens of times! But now I'm still alive. I've been sitting here for thirteen years, every tile, every brick, I can remember them all. The country has fed me for thirteen years, and has not treated me badly. In the past, we were most ungrateful to the country! Now, what should we use to repay our country? Our old homes have been destroyed by the Japanese devils, the fields have turned into barren hills, our wives and daughters have been raped, what home is there! Let's fight with the Japanese devils! Kill one, it's worth it! Kill two, get one free! Those who have the guts, follow me, A Xu!"

"I'm in! We're in! Me too!" Hundreds of iron-like roars.

A Xu led the way, followed by hundreds of brave men. An iron team, an iron torrent, went out of prison!

### Sea of Dreams

— Liu You

In spring, that gentle god, like a gentle breeze, sends me into the sea of dreams!

I drift in the sea of dreams, sailing my flower-like boat, arbitrarily east and west!

The sea of dreams is great! This is a world of bliss, with treasures that humans do not have, there are pearl islands, rose forests, beautiful birds, flying across the sky, lively fish, jumping at the bottom of the sea, that clear sea water, never turbulent; this sea of dreams, full of pleasant air!

The boat moves forward, reaching another world, the sea water is yellow, the sky there is covered with gray and dark clouds, the fish in the sea, stay dumbly in the water, how sad, how desolate A small boat, as long as there is a way to go, it will not stop. The end of the sea of dreams is a terrible world, thunder, rain, and storms stir up waves, like mountains, the boat can't stop, the big fish in the sea, open their blood-basin-like mouths, devouring everything!

Terrible! Sea of dreams, I don't want to throw myself in here again!

I mustered my courage and bravely shook the boat out of this terrible world!

That sea of dreams, boundless, the power of the boat, will never find land!

I can only clench my teeth, hold my breath, and jump from the boat into the air

Sea of dreams, this illusory vortex, I will never throw myself into your arms again!

### On Writing Biographies of National Heroes

— Ze Fu

The writing of biographies of national heroes is now considered very necessary by everyone, because on the one hand, it can not only promote the national personality expressed by our ancestors, but also inspire our descendants today to have a proper understanding of the nation. This kind of writing, of course, is aimed at the general public, so its writing, first, should use words that the public can understand, and cannot just copy some from ancient history; second, it must be compiled based on reliable materials, and cannot distort the materials, such as adding unnecessary mythical stories to fictional novels; third, it must be accompanied by brief annotations, such as place names and official names, so as to avoid readers feeling estranged after reading. Recently, I have been collecting some materials in this area, but unfortunately, I feel that there are some shortcomings in them. I dare to express my humble opinions and discuss them with the readers.

First, what I mean by using words that the public can understand is no longer a problem in the books of national heroes that have already been published. Only the Commercial Press's "Juvenile Series" is still written in classical Chinese, which is because the publication date was still in the early years of the Republic of China, so it is no wonder. However, like the two books "Wen Tianxiang" and "Shi Kefa" written by Yi Junzuo (New Life Publishing), the dialogue part still quotes the original text without translation, which is really inappropriate. For example, in "Wen Tianxiang," the examiner Wang Yinglin looked at Tianxiang's examination paper and said to the emperor: "This paper has the ancient righteousness of a tortoise mirror, and the loyal liver is like iron and stone." "Loyal liver like iron and stone" may still be understood, but "ancient righteousness of a tortoise mirror," how can the public understand it? However, it is indeed very difficult to translate classical Chinese into vernacular, so I think that in this kind of place, we only write the general meaning, and do not necessarily have to translate it according to the original text. At the same time, when writing in the vernacular, it should not be too literary, such as Wu Shutian's "Yue Fei" (Children's Publishing), which begins with writing about the sun and crows, which is quite poetic, but this is not of interest to the general public. Moreover, the story itself is earth-shattering, so I think it is better to get straight to the point and start the show lively. This kind of poetic environment cannot arouse the reader's emotions. Just like a war drama script, the opening is a beautiful garden scene, it always feels a bit out of place!

Second, what I mean by must be compiled based on reliable materials, this was not a problem. However, the problem lies in the fact that even with reliable materials, there are still places where there are misunderstandings. For example, in Zhang Yiping's "Wen Tianxiang" (Children's Publishing) in the "Escaping from Jingkou" section, it says: "Tianxiang followed the Yuan army all the way, passing Qiantang by boat, and seeing the picturesque scenery of West Lake, he couldn't help but feel sad and shed tears like rain. Later, he passed Wumen and arrived at Jingkou." According to the fact that Tianxiang was at the Yuan camp at Ting Mountain north of Lin'an (now Hangzhou) at the time, and was forced to go north by Boyan, this journey actually went north along the Grand Canal, so he passed Wumen (now Suzhou) and arrived at Jingkou (now Zhenjiang). Since he started from the north of Lin'an, how could Tianxiang see the "picturesque scenery of West Lake" again? There is no such person as Bi Wu in the Song History, but Zhang Jun mistakenly pulled him in. Also, in the same section, it says, "The person who supervised Tianxiang was named Wang Qianhu." An Qianhu is the name of an official weaving, not a name, this is also a misunderstanding, which is very different from the original meaning. Also, like Yi Junzuo's "Wen Tianxiang," there are also similar errors, such as saying: "In the first year of Zui Ding, the court appointed him as the Jiedushi of the Zhennan Army." According to Liu Yueshen's Biography of Prime Minister Wen, it originally said: "He was appointed as a judge in the office of the Ninghai Army Jiedushi. Tianxiang wrote a letter begging to kill Dong Songchen, but it was not reported, so he resigned and returned. He was transferred from his previous position to the Zhennan Army." That is, the Zhennan Army was also a judge in the Jiedushi's office, not a Jiedushi. Moreover, this was not a conferment of nobility, but just a dismissal from office, and cannot be called a "conferment." Furthermore, in Wu Shutian's "Yue Fei," in his "Battle of Dongting Lake," he mistakenly wrote "Zhang Jun" as "Zhang Jun," which can be said to be extremely negligent. I don't know that Jun and Jun were originally two people, how can they be confused? Also, Zhang Jun was the commander of all the armies at the time, and Yue Fei was just a general. To use today's situation as an analogy, one is the commander-in-chief, and the other is the army commander. The army commander naturally has a hierarchical relationship with the commander. However, when Wu Jun wrote about Yue Fei speaking to Zhang Jun, it was: "No need, you just need to order to keep the troops for eight days, and I guarantee that I will pacify Dongting Lake." According to Yue Fei's original biography in the Song History, it said: "Already has a decision. The commander can stay a little longer, and the bandits can be broken in less than eight days." Clearly, he was addressing the commander and not using "you," but she changed it to a "you" word, which is directly like an order, which is really not the tone of speaking to a superior.

Third, what I mean by must be accompanied by simple annotations is because the names are different in ancient and modern times, and it is difficult for the public to understand without annotations. For example, in the section where Yue Fei attacked Li Cheng, Li Cheng left a general to invade "Hongzhou." This Hongzhou does not exist on the current map. If we add an annotation "that is, Nanchang, Jiangxi today," wouldn't it be easier for readers to understand? Also, as mentioned above, Wen Tianxiang was the "judge in the office of the Ninghai Army Jiedushi," and there is no such official name now. We might as well simply say that it is an official in charge of documents and accounting. Unfortunately, most of the books we have seen do not take these into account, especially the official names, which are not annotated.

The above is only my personal opinion. The books listed are just random examples. If there is anything presumptuous, please forgive the original authors and readers!

### April Fool's Day Passes

— Wo Fo

April 1st is "April Fool's Day," which has spread from Europe and the United States to China. It can also be said to be "Rumor Day," because everyone on this day, taking advantage of their happiness, may as well fabricate some rumors to fool their friends for fun. Fortunately, the festival is called "April Fool's," and even if friends love your deception, they will laugh it off and not take it seriously.

In the past, on every "April Fool's Day," the jokes of fooling and being fooled in European and American societies were too numerous to describe. Even in China, in addition to friends showing off their skills in deceiving friends to decorate this Westernized festival, several newspapers also fabricated rumors on this day. For example, when Mei Lanfang went to the United States to perform and was about to return home, the Ta Kung Pao took advantage of April Fool's Day to create a fake telegram saying that Mei Lanfang had returned to Shanghai. This news harmed two Japanese reporters, who hurriedly sent telegrams to report to Tokyo. A newspaper called the Commercial Daily in Guangzhou also published a news story on April Fool's Day saying that Ruan Lingyu was not dead. Some newspapers in Shanghai saw it and actually believed it to be true, and hurriedly reprinted it, and some even published special editions and extras.

However, this year's "April Fool's Day" is bound to be different from the past. Among friends, of course, no one will be willing to use this kind of boring deception to make fun of others. Newspapers bearing the responsibility of reporting, in this great and solemn period, will no longer have this kind of leisurely mood. However, only in this great and solemn period, we are actually spending "April Fool's Day" almost every day, and we should be cautious and careful every day to guard against the fooling tricks that people are constantly showing. Isn't that so? In order to put our nation in a place of eternal destruction, but force alone cannot work, and it has even proved to have failed, so they rack their brains to spread many rumors and show all kinds of fooling tricks, hoping to fulfill their wishes. Also, because their rumors are the crystallization of those conspirators, if we are not careful, we may be deceived by them. I am afraid that we should be as cautious about these rumors as we are about "April Fool's Day," and under calm observation and precise analysis, we should strengthen our confidence and answer them with an unyielding attitude, so that they have no way to show their fooling tricks!

### "General Review"?

— Wu Ren Zhi

Thoughts on Reading "The Low Tide of Shanghai Theater Movement"

Mr. Lvg Kang published an article "The Low Tide of Shanghai Theater Movement" in the Hong Kong Ta Kung Pao, with the subtitle "General Review of the Visibility Altar in the Isolated Island." The article is quite long and contains a lot of political jargon. However, after only two issues, all the theater people in Shanghai could no longer stand it. The reason is not that they do not accept the "general review," but that they regret that the basis of the so-called "review" is not fact, but fabrication; the corrections and criticisms are not only empty, but also form framing, and flow into defending the evil forces that bind the Shanghai theater movement. The use of political jargon has also become his own flaunting and the hats he puts on others. Mr. Li Jianwu only read the two issues published on February 28 and March 1, and already felt "the need to correct it immediately," pointing out six factual corrections. (1) "The Shanghai Art Theater is not a branch of Qingdao, let alone orthodox" (2) "No so-called popular writer (referring to Mr. A Ying) has been found in the Shanghai Art Theater to be doing "any manipulation" (3) "The Shanghai Art Theater has never interfered in Xiao Feng's affairs" (4) "There are also former members of the amateur experimental theater group in the Shanghai Art Theater. Mr. Lvg Kang should not create incidents to provoke the feelings of amateur theater groups who are engaged in arduous work in the mainland and isolated island theater people" (5) "The fatal injury of the Shanghai Art Theater lies in external destruction and failure to obtain registration permission, and the difficulty of registration is a common experience for all theater groups, and there is no need to speculate wildly. As for external destruction, there are two pairs of connected threatening letters. (Mr. Lvg Kang denies the external evil forces and defends them. I don't know what the argument is) (6) "The Xiao Feng incident is a mystery. The list published in the Da Wan Pao is the investigator: this has nothing to do with the political morality of the isolated island theater people, and cannot be talked about as "regrettable." Finally, Mr. Li also pointed out a few points: (1) "Some people say that he (referring to Mr. Lvg Kang) is Mr. Xiao Mao, who opposes the reform of civilization drama. Maybe not. One thing is true: that is, he has not had a deeper relationship with the personnel and theater movement in the isolated island." (2) "The four doors of the isolated island theater community are wide open. Anyone who stands on a line can come in, only Mr. Lvg Kang sees "sectarianism." And uses Mr. Li's own fact of not being "kicked away" as proof." (3) A group of people engaged in theater movement on the isolated island?

Young people are respectable and pitiful. Their perseverance is probably unexpected by Mr. Lvg Kang. Mr. Li has been messing around with these young people for a year and is moved to "now appear to have become one with them." Now that Mr. Lvg Kang's great work has been completed, everyone has read it all. In terms of facts, there are of course more and more corrections that can be added. However, I don't understand why I don't want to write more "defense" and "correction" here. But I can't help but write, because I have many feelings about this article. Then let's write about feelings.

"Lvg Kang," "Zong Yu," and "Xiao Mao"

The Ta Kung Pao's announcement for this article was "Zong Yu," but it was published as "Lvg Kang," and the legend in Shanghai is "Xiao Mao," who opposes the reform of civilization drama. At the civilization drama reform symposium, Lvg Kang also agreed to the reform (see the symposium record in the Da Wan Pao). I am the least familiar with the personnel in the literary world, so I naturally cannot talk about "hatred." Therefore, I naively thought here: Is "Lvg Kang" "Xiao Mao"? Why does "Lvg Kang's" article end the discussion on the "civilization drama reform movement" by saying: "The end proves the correctness of the theory of "for life" and "the transformation of civilization drama" (Xiao Mao)—original text—which contains constructive struggles."? If these two names are the same person, please forgive me for naively criticizing two words—despicable! "Scholars have no morals," I never believed this. After reading Mr. Lvg Kang's words such as "political morality," I have a sense of "disappointment." But it is a pity that the Shanghai theater movement is unfairly wronged by this.

"Review" of Work Surface and "Review" of Internal Organization

Like Mr. Lvg Kang, who "no one can say that he is in the circle," may be able to make a "review" based on the surface of the work he has seen, which may still make people feel pertinent. In fact, even this point, Mr. Lvg Kang's work still has problems. For example, he said that "The City That Never Sleeps" is an achievement of reforming civilization drama. I don't know that this script was performed six months before the reform of civilization drama. If we want to talk about the "review" of the internal organization, but it is not based on true facts as the starting point, the "theory" obtained is bound to be wrong. It is inevitable. It is not a pity that one's own theory is wrong, but it is a pity that the Shanghai theater movement is badly affected. Disregarding the impact and slandering emotionally, to borrow Mr. Lvg Kang's own words: "Magnifies one's own mistakes and puts oneself in theoretical bankruptcy in front of the audience and readers." I think the result is to expose oneself, which is painful for relatives and pleasing to enemies! (To be continued)

### Impressions of "Wings of the Navy"

— Li Zhihua

(Wings of the Navy)

A Warner Bros. production, showing at the Da Guangming Theater

In newspapers, we are accustomed to hearing about the military expansions of various countries; on the silver screen, military-themed films have also become increasingly common lately. We know there must be a reason for this.

Therefore, when we view this film, "Wings of the Navy," with the same understanding, it might help us to better grasp the subject matter.

"Wings of the Navy" is another film depicting aviation, extensively detailing the process of how air force personnel are created, interspersed with themes of fraternal love and personal affections.

Yes, I should clarify that "Wings of the Navy" describes the process of creating an air force person in considerable detail, from the entrance exams to blind flying. The author expresses everything thoroughly. Fearing the audience's courage might falter, the author depicts their setbacks, but ultimately, they overcome the difficulties and become active in the skies. This is true not only of the final climax but also throughout the film, where the author meticulously explains their successes after each failure. We should understand and appreciate this deliberate effort.

The themes of "Wings of the Navy" are demonstration and encouragement. Woven throughout is a love story.

This love story is a love triangle, but the author doesn't focus heavily on it. The related aspects are still tied to their careers.

For example, in addition to introducing the course processes, we can see this in the two scenes of high-altitude testing accidents and successes.

These two scenes are written in contrast. In the first scene, the plane ascends and suddenly plummets, the pilot faints due to air pressure impact and falls straight down. Keith’s anxious and fearful expression, the sound of the plane crashing, many personnel rushing to rescue, Keith’s rigid back view; the second scene is when Keith discovers that his brother is the pilot of the second high-altitude test. He wants to stop him, but is held back by Jerry's companion. Jerry takes off, ascending to high altitude again, and again suddenly descends, again suffering from air pressure impact. Jerry almost faints, the plane plummets and sways. Keith and Irene's anxious and worried expressions, the plane finally overcomes the difficulty and stabilizes. Keith and Irene both breathe a sigh of relief and laugh. These two scenes are almost identical in their structure, especially the shots of the plane plummeting and the pilot about to faint from the air pressure impact. However, we don't feel it is repetitive or lengthy; on the contrary, it elevates our emotions. Such a clear, brisk, and spirited weaving is extremely delightful. George Brent's and Olivia de Havilland's relieved smiles also become the audience's smiles.

Olivia de Havilland doesn't have many scenes. Honestly, she cannot be considered the protagonist in this film. The true protagonists are all kinds of airplanes. The best scene is the one mentioned above. The same goes for George Brent and John Payne.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Chapter 7: Swallows and Orioles, a United Double Jade Bi; Yue Luo and Wu Brocade, Seven-Sectioned Looms

Originally, the children in this Qingying (Infant) Home had fixed times for sleeping, eating, playing, etc. They were all based on science. Everything also depended on the age of the infants. Every nanny had to adhere to the regulations and order of the home. Ms. Kang Faning felt her responsibility was greater, as it concerned the honor of the home. Therefore, while another nanny might care for four or five children, she only cared for these three children, which also showed the importance that the director of the Infant Welfare Association, Dr. Yin, placed on her. Ms. Kang Ning had already been married. She herself had given birth to a girl, who was also in this Infant Home, cared for by another nanny. Now, she single-mindedly devoted herself to caring for these three little darlings. When the two Miss He entered, they saw the room was in the shape of the character "工," with three small beds placed in it, where the three children slept. There was also a large bed, presumably where she slept. Ms. Kang Ning was leaning against her own bed, and the three children were climbing all over her. One was holding her neck, offering their apple-like little face for her to kiss. One was hugging one of her arms, resting their short-haired forehead on her arm. One was lying across her head, reaching their little hand into her chest. Ms. Kang Ning chuckled, and the three children also laughed incessantly. Zhu Airen walked in first and called out, "Ms. Kang, you have guests!" Ms. Kang Ning quickly steadied the three children and looked up. She saw Liao De, the director of the Infant Welfare Association. There were also two others, with similar faces, who were somewhat unfamiliar. Although they were unfamiliar, she knew that Zhu Airen had not come here yesterday afternoon, and it was said that he had gone to the Suzhou train station to pick up two classmates. These were probably those two. At that time, Ms. Kang Ning also introduced these three little friends to them, "Look! Mr. Zhu and Mr. Liao are here. Hurry! Be good! Don't make a fuss! Bow to these gentlemen and shake hands." Sure enough, one of the three children extended a small hand. Zhu Airen quickly took it and praised, "Good boy! Little brother!" The other two also hurriedly extended their hands. The two Miss He each took one, rubbing their snow-white, soft arms against their noses. Zhu Airen then introduced the two Miss He to Ms. Kang Ning. Hai Ying also introduced Ms. Kang Ning to the two Miss He. Ms. Kang Ning then instructed the three little boys to bow to the two Miss He. At this time, the children in this room were not afraid of strangers at all, their eyes as bright as lacquer, looking at everyone. (75)

### Plot of Miles of Sky

— Tongye, sent from Chongqing

An Air Force Movie Produced by Central Photography Studio

Consultant: Xie Taojun, Producer: Luo Xueqian

Director: Sun Yu, Cinematographer: Hong Weilie

Cast: Gao Gefei, Bai Yang, Zhao Dan, Gu Er'yi, Shi Chao, etc.

"Air Force movies" have never been made in our country. Now, the Central Photography Studio's new "Miles of Sky" can be said to be an unprecedented great aviation film. Not only is the plot tortuous and mysterious, but the acting is also passionate and intense; watching it will definitely make your blood boil. Unfortunately, we residents of isolated islands can only yearn for it temporarily, and it will not be able to enter our sight until the final victory. I will now introduce the plot to the readers first, which can also give you some spiritual comfort! (Editor)

On September 18th Incident, Japanese bandits seized our four northeastern provinces, and thirty million compatriots were reduced to slaves, and more than five million square miles of land was trampled on by enemy hooves. Vast wealth, huge amounts of ordnance, along with 260 aircraft, all fell into enemy hands; the Northeast Aviation School was also destroyed.

Gao Fei, a mechanic from the Northeast Aviation School, followed the crowd into the interior. During the journey, they were chased and strafed by enemy aircraft, causing many casualties. A girl, Bai Shanfeng, helped her injured father, leaving her younger sister, Xiao Yun, behind. During the dangerous journey, Gao Fei hid and protected Xiao Yun, saving her from death. Gao watched the enemy aircraft with burning anger.

Gao had relatives in Jinan, so he studied at Qilu University and its affiliated high school. In his spare time, he often engaged in physical exercise. One day, in the sports field, he chatted with his classmates Yue Yiqin and Zhao Wanli. Yue was lying on the grass, looking at three or five eagles circling in the sky, as if lost in thought. Gao asked him, and Yue smiled and showed him a newspaper clipping of the Central Aviation School in Jianqiao advertising for flying students. Gao and Zhao also each produced their own clippings of the same advertisement, and the three agreed. They decided to leave Qilu and study aviation instead.

Since the "January 28th" Incident, our country has worked hard to build an air force. Young people from all over the country came after hearing the news. Gao, Yue, and Zhao passed the preliminary and follow-up physical and academic tests and joined the Air Force Enlistment Camp, where they received army training for one year before being promoted to flight students. At the opening ceremony, they respectfully listened to the address, received the Air Force Training Regulations and Air Force Creed, and sang the aviation school's school song, which was magnificent and soaring.

Gao, Yue, Zhao, and other flight students such as Gu Changkong, were trained by Captain Gao Zhihang. They were divided into groups to learn basic flying. The first time they flew into the clouds, it was like ascending to heaven.

Mechanic Shi Qi was loyal to his service. He once jokingly told Gao and Zhao that mechanics are bird watchers; washing them, brushing them, healing them, feeding them, so that they can fly, sing, and fight, but these are iron birds. Thousands of hot-blooded youths were nurtured and trained for the country, just like thousands of iron blocks, forged into steel in a furnace. Gao, Yue, Zhao, and other flight students decided to take on the future heavy responsibility of the country, and under the iron training discipline, they got up early, assembled, practiced flying, exercised, and rested, bravely moving forward day by day, year by year, and year by year. Zhao, Yue, and others all graduated and became team members, or served as instructors to train flight students who came later.

In the midst of arduous and intense training, there should also be adequate rest. One Sunday, four trucks drove out of the aviation school gate to the fruit shop outside the school where they were friendly with the girl Qing'er. As usual, aviation school students would buy a large amount of fruit from Qing'er. On that day, Gao Fei, Zhao Wanli, Shi Qi, and Gu Changkong, four close friends, were on the same car. Shi, Zhao, and Yue deliberately made things difficult for Gao and Gu, buying all the fruit in Qing'er's basket and throwing it to their comrades in the car to eat, singing and laughing. They soon arrived in Hangzhou. The air force athletes dispersed or went together to visit friends, climb mountains, ride horses, or race boats. The Six Bridges and Three Tianzhu were decorated by the air force athletes, adding a lot of color.

Gao, Zhao, Gu, and Shi toured Sudi together and met a girl, Bai Shanfeng, whom they were amazed as a celestial being. They attempted to get to know her, as the four were not yet married. Unfortunately, there was no way to know who she was. Later, they entered the newly opened Fengyun Cafe and learned that the girl was the daughter of the owner, Bai Shanfeng.

Before long, a team of elementary school students, male and female, entered the cafe to raise money for airplane donations. First, they sang a patriotic song, "Tomorrow's Victory," saying that those who have strength should contribute strength, and those who have money should contribute money. The leader of the singing was Bai Shanfeng's younger sister, Bai Xiaoyun. After singing, they split up to solicit donations from each table. The air force athletes scrambled to donate generously. Other customers also readily gave money. However, one customer, wanting to fawn over his girlfriend, hated that the children's singing interrupted his flattery. He refused to donate a single coin, and ridiculed the absurdity of raising money for airplanes, also involving air force issues. Xiaoyun was humiliated and cried. Gao, Zhao, and other drinkers were greatly indignant and severely punished him. After scolding him, they asked him to try the taste of an airplane bombing, and the group threw eggs at him, drenching him thoroughly. (To be continued tomorrow)

### Secret History of the Forbidden City and the Pear Garden of the Old Capital (135)

— Xu Muyun

Thirteenth Sister Filial to Her Mother and Righteousness Respecting Her Teacher

As for He Yufeng, she was the beloved daughter of a martial general. Although she had learned some martial arts from her father since childhood, she was not as timid as Young Master An. However, because she constantly remembered the deep hatred of killing her father, she inquired about the news of her enemies everywhere. Not only did she live incognito in no fixed place, fearing the secret schemes of the Ji bandits, but she also had to serve her elderly and sick mother, escaping east and west, living a life of exile. The sadness in her heart was naturally ten times greater than that of Young Master An. However, she also held the same concept of "filial piety," so she threw all kinds of pain into the land of nothingness. The two protagonists in the book both did not forget the foundation of being human, to be filial sons and daughters, therefore, after they met each other, they achieved a happy marriage. Although there were many twists and turns in the middle, and Mr. An (Young Master An's father, named Xuehai.) put in a lot of effort to achieve this, the result was that he managed to marry this chivalrous and filial woman who was beautiful and talented, letting his son enjoy this good fortune. If you want to talk about it in terms of superstition, it was all due to the couple's filial piety, which allowed them to be matched.

Ji Gantang in "A Tale of Heroic Sons and Daughters" is known to everyone to be an allusion to Nian Gengyao, because the six characters Nian, Geng, Xian, Tang, Yao, are all words used in Qing Dynasty for comparison. In the early Qing Dynasty, Nian Gengyao successively held the official positions of Governor of Sichuan and Shaanxi and General Fuyuan, suppressing the border in Sichuan, conquering Tibet, and pacifying Qinghai, making many meritorious contributions and being granted the title of first-class duke. His power at that time was truly enormous and amazing, and his personality was cruel and bloodthirsty, and his military orders were strict, making him one of the top figures since the Qing Dynasty.

Dance World Shadows
— Xiaotian

### Random Notes from the Metropolis

The dance manuscript has reached its sixteenth installment. There have been few realistic records in between. The Metropolis is a place where my footprints are more frequent, so the impression is also more profound. It may be written based on facts (sixteen) and asking for advice from fellow enthusiasts.

A Glimpse of the Ballroom

The Metropolis, based on its moderate location, has a vast garden and lush trees. Although the architecture is not as elaborate as the Xianle and Baili Men, it makes up for its shortcomings and can be called no less than them. The door faces Gordon Road, next to Dahua Road, making parking extremely convenient. Inside the first door, there is a counter for hiring silver cars. Inside the second door is a reception room, with cloakrooms, public telephone rooms, and men's restrooms on both sides. Inside the third door is a corridor, with snack and toy stalls on both sides. There, you can often see two friends in neat suits serving as greeters. On their chubby faces, there is always a smile and a friendly expression. Their attitude towards guests, regardless of gender, age, or seniority, has never changed. It is true that harmony brings wealth, and it cannot be said that these two have not made a part of the contribution to the prosperity of the Metropolis. I am a forgetful person, I only remember that the younger one is called Afeng, and I heard that he is the deputy manager inside.

Passing through the corridor is the dance floor, divided into three levels. The highest level is along the edge, with long sofas, which is very convenient for couples to accompany. A circle of single-person walking paths is left in front of the sofa. The second level is set up with many round tables and seats that can accommodate two to three hundred people. The last level is the dance floor. The pool is circular, extremely large, and the floor is extremely smooth. There are twenty-eight round tables by the pool, each with four seats. This is the throne of the dancers. If all the seats are full, there will be as many as one hundred and twelve people. However, the four tables at the head and tail are probably always absent. Looking around, the number is generally around one hundred.

Brilliant Red Stars Now it is time to write about all the brilliant red stars. Before writing, I must apologize, because to write about all one hundred people, not only is the length of the article not allowed, but I also do not have such a good memory. If I choose to write, the so-called "allowable person, in the end, should the subjective standard be used, or the objective standard be used?" Fortunately, the name of the article I write is called Xie Ying (Writing Shadows), so I might as well write some unclear comments based on some muddled impressions. As for whether the records are correct and the comments are fair, it can be said that I myself am at a loss.

Starting from the music stage at the entrance, Min Huang sits at the sixth table. Although she is young, she is quite quiet and lovely, and she is also quite understanding of people. She always responds with a smile, and her dancing skills are not weak. The seventh table is Ma Yuanyuan, whose original surname is Zheng. Zheng is Huang’s nephew and uncle, slim and exquisite, fair and delicate. She is older than Huang, but her childishness surpasses him. Some say she is innocent, others dislike her willfulness. She can sing one or two Beijing opera songs, and her Shanghai opera and Yue opera imitations are very good. Shen Weiying at the ninth table is very beautiful from a distance, but seems to be slightly inferior up close. Ye Peishan at the eleventh table is a big child. If you don’t ask her age, you can’t guess that she is only twenty-eight years old. She has a round face and bright eyes, with a unique style. Li Mingzhu is a beautiful woman approaching her prime. She can communicate with her eyes, and her conversation is naturally even more skillful. Ru Aina has a beautiful appearance, and Sister Hu is good at flattery, both are good. Yu Manli at the twelfth table, whose real name is Zuo Zhongyu, can be considered a beauty in the making, but unfortunately, she is often sick, and even in normal times, she cannot avoid having some morbidity. She used to not be able to talk much, but now she has improved a lot. Huang Meiqin was only discovered yesterday, and her dancing skills are very good. Jin Lili at the thirteenth table, her dancing skills truly deserve the praise of being light as a swallow. Her temperament and attitude can also be described as gentle and generous. She sings Qingyi with good rhythm and tone. It is said that her brother once learned the erhu at my house, and she also wanted to ask me to learn some singing and acting, but unfortunately, I have been called her master for several months, and I have not learned half an act. It is really that we do not have time and there is no way. Her younger sister, Jin Didi, is a very young child, and her appearance is very much like a beauty in the making. At the same table is also Gu Yumei, who is tall and graceful, and has a beautiful appearance. Because the newspaper published a case involving her and Lei Xiaokai, her business has decreased a lot. It is said that she will be leaving the pier soon. There is also Li Ying, who is twenty years old. The upper half of her face is very much like Mei Lanfang, and her temper is very gentle. Recently, she also wanted to learn opera, and it is said that her voice is good, but unfortunately, I have never heard her. At the fourteenth table is Xu Cuiying, who can be called a social expert. The Cao Suqin sisters at the twentieth table, one is charming, and the other is lively and lovely. They are both very tall and are very suitable for dancing with tall guests. There are also Zheng Mingming, Lin Beibei, and Yang Wenying, who, like Jin Lili, belong to the top ten dancers who were selected. The ceremony was held at the Baili Men on the Yellow Flower Mound Memorial Day, and it was very lively. The length of the article is already long, so I will not list more. In short, the Metropolis has a complete and rich pool of talent.

Due to advertising congestion today, the length of the article has been shortened, and the chess garden will be suspended once. It will be published tomorrow as usual. This is an announcement.

### Finance  International Aid Obtained, Gold Prices Plunge

Yesterday, spot gold's gray market continued its decline. It's understood that this was due to news reports that a US$15 million loan from the US had been secured. Although it was specified that these funds were allocated for the purchase of aircraft engines, it further brightened prospects for the war effort. Also, French Premier Daladier's tough stance ensured no change in Franco-Italian relations. The British monarch has approved a loan of £5 million to China to replenish the legal tender (fapi) fund. With increasingly stable and profitable legal tender, naturally fewer people were interested in stagnant gold. Wealthy collectors generally thought about taking action. Therefore, although a certain bank (acting on behalf of a foreign bank) actively bought 150 taels, and some money changers also made small purchases, everyone was unanimously bearish. Furthermore, gold shops and pawnshops, along with two other money changers, began selling off their holdings en masse, causing prices to plunge sharply, ultimately falling by twelve yuan. Although foreign banks secretly absorbed some gold during the middle of the day, it had no significant impact. Trading was slightly more active than the previous two days, with 550 taels changing hands. Gold jewelry prices remained steady. Customs gold remained level. China-British pure gold continued to rise slightly.

Spot Gold Plunges Twelve Yuan

Since the morning, each tael (ten liang) initially opened weaker, because of the news that day of the successful Sino-American loan, and the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to trend looser and stronger due to the impact of devaluation, causing sentiment to weaken again. Gold shops took the lead and quoted 2,080 yuan for sale, but at that time, buyers were holding back and watching. At 9:45 AM, a certain bank suddenly started buying on behalf of foreign banks, and transactions began. Gold shops and spot gold shops successively sold a total of 150 taels to a certain bank at 2,077 yuan, which was the opening price, five yuan lower than the previous closing price. After the opening, jewelry stores also came to sell off their holdings, selling 50 taels at the same price to fellow businesses, money changers, and securities firms. Afterwards, a certain money changer absorbed 50 taels from fellow businesses and gold shops, priced at 76 yuan. After this, sellers still wanted to dump their holdings, but because buyers were holding back and observing, no transactions occurred until noon, so the closing price remained at 76 yuan. In the afternoon, because sellers were even more cautious and watchful, the market became increasingly weak. The initial transaction was four yuan lower, with money changers trading five taels among themselves at 72 yuan. Subsequently, a gold shop sold 50 taels to a money changer at 71 yuan. Later, the money changer sold 50 taels to a gold shop at 70 yuan. After this, the market became quiet. Until after 4:00 PM, a certain jewelry store suddenly expressed interest in buying, but sellers had no inventory to supply, making transactions difficult. Therefore, the closing price in the evening remained at 2,070 yuan, resulting in a net drop of twelve yuan compared to the previous day, a full seven yuan difference. The selling price of spot gold from spot gold shops was 2,080 yuan, and the buying price was 2,065 yuan. The current asking price for gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed price, but no transactions took place.

Jewelry Prices Remain at Original Levels. Although spot gold prices trended lower, the listed prices for gold jewelry in jewelry stores remained at their original levels. Dahang's price was 211 yuan per tael, Xinhang's price was 209 yuan, and the buying price was 203 yuan.

Pure Gold Continues to Rise Half a Penny

London, 30th. According to a telegram, British pure gold continued to rise by half a penny per ounce, reaching £7, 8 shillings, 6 and a half pennies. As a result, the central bank's buying price for Chinese spot gold also rose to 1,212 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed price for customs gold remained level at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also continued to rise by 3 jiao, reaching 1,207 yuan and 9 jiao.

### Money Changers Also Selling Hong Kong Notes

Yesterday, British pure gold continued to rise by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate remained unchanged. The local foreign exchange market was experiencing a peak in settlement by various companies and foreign firms at the end of the month. Fortunately, the supply of Hong Kong telegraphs and foreign banks was smooth, and the market price remained stable, with neither gains nor losses. Spot gold opened weakly, and there was a lot of selling pressure. Jewelry stores and money changers were unable to absorb the selling pressure effectively. Subsequently, the Hong Kong exchange rate was reported to be loose, and the Hong Kong gold price fell. Gold shops and money changers sold their holdings in a rush, further weakening the market price. Trading was sluggish. Foreign currency, British gold pounds, continued to flow out of wealthy hands. The market price weakened and declined accordingly. There was strong demand for British and American gold notes from foreign banks. There were rumors of Hong Kong currency devaluation, and money changers rushed to sell their holdings, creating a very weak market. Fortunately, foreign banks absorbed the selling pressure smoothly, gradually halting the downward trend. The exchange market association had very active trading. Changtai sold 200 yuan of Hong Kong notes to Yongtai. Hengmao sold 1,000 yuan of Hong Kong notes to Hongchang. Qintai sold 500 yuan of US dollar notes to Tongfeng. Xianglian sold 500 yuan of US dollar notes to Yongtai. Tongfeng sold 2,000 yuan of Hong Kong notes to Hongchang. Xiangkang sold 300 yuan of Hong Kong notes to Hongchang. Changtai sold 30 pounds of British gold notes to Tongfeng. Chengtai sold 40 pounds of British gold notes to Tongfeng. Qintai sold 30 pounds of British gold notes to Tongfeng. Hongchang sold 200 yuan of Hong Kong notes to Changtai. Huitong sold 30 pounds of British gold notes to Changtai. Yesterday's market prices saw the British gold pound drop by 1 jiao, the US dollar note rise by 4 li, the Hong Kong note drop by 2 fen, 4 qu, and the French franc note rise by 5 hao. Other currencies remained unchanged.

### Hong Kong Exchange Rate Marked by Selling; Finally Loosening to Fifty-Six Yuan; British-American Exchange Rate Remains Stable

Although large foreign firms and foreign merchants colluded in the foreign exchange market yesterday, foreign banks such as HSBC were willing to supply, and there were also some sales coming from Hong Kong via foreign telegrams. Consequently, there were no fluctuations in the middle of the day, and the overall result was neither gains nor losses. Trading was average throughout the day. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, due to the previous day's weakness and the growing rumors of Hong Kong currency devaluation, Chinese and foreign banks rushed to sell, almost creating a wave of selling. In addition, the settlement of accounts by foreign firms decreased, so the loosening trend was quite sharp, eventually reaching 56 yuan. Trading was also very active.

In the early morning, large London drafts for near and distant dates were level, and New York silver prices remained stable. London raw gold rose by half a penny, the exchange rate of British pound against US dollar rose by 7 hao, and there were no changes against French franc or Shanghai. The US dollar against British pound and French franc also remained unchanged, but fell by 6 fen against Shanghai. The Shanghai Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's opening selling prices in the morning were 8 pence 25 for British pound and 16 yuan 0625 for US dollar, both level compared to the previous close. After the opening, foreign firms and foreign merchants successively concluded transactions, but foreign firms such as HSBC were willing to supply, so the situation remained quite stable. Foreign firms advantageously settled British pound at 8 pence 25 with HSBC, and HSBC's listed price remained unchanged. The unveiling of the silver equalization tax was also level, still levied at 4.00 percent. Subsequently, foreign firms again bought US dollar at 16 yuan 0625 from a certain bank, and the situation remained largely unchanged. Later, transactions gradually calmed down, while buying and selling of Hong Kong exchange rate was quite lively. Foreign banks Hua Yi, Dutch bank, and Chinese bank Guangdong, all started selling Hong Kong exchange rate to foreign firms, from 55 yuan 625 loosening to 56 yuan. Later, it rebounded to 55 yuan 875. By the time the bank's selling price closed at noon, the British and American exchange rates were the same as the opening prices in the morning.

In the afternoon market, foreign firms initially settled British pound at 8 pence 25 with Hong Kong Electric HSBC, and the situation remained quite stable. The US dollar situation was also level, but no transactions were seen. After entering the afternoon, Hong Kong exchange rate was very active in buying and selling. Chinese banks again sold Hong Kong exchange rate to foreign firms at 56 yuan. By the time the bank's selling prices closed in the evening, the British pound was at 8 pence 25, and the US dollar was at 16 yuan 0625. As a result, compared to the previous day, neither the British nor American exchange rates saw any gains or losses, while the Hong Kong exchange rate continued to loosen by half a yuan.

Corresponding circulars are hereby issued, and it is hoped that you will comply accordingly." (Yu)

### Securities Internal and External Debt Showing Weakness

The gray market for securities yesterday continued to be quiet and stagnant. Individual retail investors were weak in sentiment. Large institutional investors were watching each other. Although there was the establishment of the US loan and the long-term public price of finance to pay principal and interest, the appetite of the "eating households" remained sluggish. The market situation was uncertain, but because there were only a few sellers, the surface still felt firm. The future may still have a period of sideways movement. Yesterday's progress: The market initially trended upward in the morning due to purchases by Tianxing Lemao, but then turned weak due to sales by Tongkang Xieda. Although Lianhehao had replenishment purchases, retail investors still had disposals, and it still felt unable to rally. In the afternoon, Tongkang continued to have sales, and Yongkang sold Class B. Although the 20th and 40th slightly collected, the market price was just stagnant. As a result, E, D, and C all had no ups and downs, Class A was down slightly 2 jiao, and Class E was down slightly 5 fen. The number of transactions was generally no more than 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Stock market conditions: 50 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company stock were traded at a price of 6 yuan and 5 jiao.

London China bonds, the listed market price on the 30th of last month (Thursday), the market disk was stagnant, and basically had to wait until the Chinese government and the creditors' representatives had agreed on concrete measures before it could be restarted. Yesterday's market conditions: A small number of bonds had already fallen, including the Crisp Loan and the Canton-Kowloon Railway Loan, each falling by £1.5. The former was priced at £38, and the latter was priced at £19.5. (According to the Crisp Loan, yesterday was the interest payment period, and the new price should be calculated excluding interest. If calculated excluding interest of £2.5, the market price actually rose by £1.) Also, the British-issued bonds of the Reorganization Loan also rose by half a pound, priced at £51.5, and the rest were unchanged.

London British Far East company stocks, the listed market price on the 30th of last month (Thursday), the trend turned stable. Only Jardine Matheson Bank shares continued to fall by 2 shillings and 6 pence, priced at £8, 7 shillings and 6 pence, and the rest were unchanged.

The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stock market is currently in a state of confusion and slight weakness. Although the selling wind is not strong, the prices of most stocks have slightly fallen. Jardine Matheson shares' buying price has fallen to 19 yuan and 5 jiao. The price of Wheelock shares once fell to 34 yuan, 2 jiao, 5 fen, and the price of Consolidated Rubber Plantation fell to 8 yuan. These prices saw a small number of buyers. Yup Kwong shares were traded at 8 yuan, 8 jiao. Tramway shares and Kung Wo Cheung shares' potential remains strong. There is still good demand for the debentures of various companies. Rubber shares' trading is stagnant, and the difference between the buying and selling prices is very large.

### Yarn and Cotton, Coarse Yarn Tianjin Merchants Continue Healthy Purchasing, 20-Count Yarn Able to Maintain, Japanese Yarn Mills Offer 2,000-3,000 Bales

The yarn market still shows signs of fluctuating, but the actual demand is still not strong, and people's hearts are more peaceful. In addition, the situation of 10-count coarse yarn is tight, and Tianjin merchants' digestion continues unabated. The market price of 32-count single yarn is also safe, so although the chips in the market for 20-count yarn have increased, some are paying attention to the above situation, and the attitude is mostly tranquil, without panic. As for the transportation along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi route being affected by the military and temporarily suspended, fortunately, there is still demand in South China, Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, etc., and the market price is maintained by it. Generally speaking, it is currently in a fluctuating state. If it remains stagnant for a long time and the merchant sales do not come, there may be changes again.

Current Yarn Situation: The market opened weakly again in the morning. After waiting for a long time, merchants did not come to purchase. The current yarn dispatched by general current yarn merchants was in a hurry to sell off, and the opening price fell by another 1.5 yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 370 yuan and 5 jiao. Guangdong merchants Wanxing bought 200 bales, leading to support of the virtual qi. Subsequently, the market gradually rebounded as the situation stabilized. By the closing, the current price returned to 372 yuan. The warehouse receipt price initially fell to 369 yuan and 5 jiao, and also returned to 71 yuan at the closing. The market was still sluggish and weak in the afternoon. Only 10-count coarse yarn was more solid due to the constant search by Tianjin merchants. As a result, various merchants bought a total of 1,360 bales. The market conditions for 20-count Tiannv and Shuangma were not much different from the market price of the previous day. Only the prices of 16-count and 10-count yarn were stable as usual. Xinyu Factory offered 200 bales of 10-count Shuang Diqiu, priced from 291 yuan and 5 jiao to 1 yuan and 7 jiao. Shenxin Factory offered 120 bales of 10-count Tongzijun, priced at 290 yuan and 5 jiao, all bought by Tianjin merchants. Today, 1,700 pieces of yarn were transported to Tianjin, 1,000 pieces to Shantou, 140 pieces to Hong Kong, 120 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 797 pieces to Haiphong. The amount bought by each merchant is recorded on the left.

Japanese Yarn Market: The trend turned downward, because the high prices in recent days have caused the factory to offer 20-count Shuiyue and Lanfeng yarn in April and May, as many as 2,000 to 3,000 bales. As a result, the people's hearts loosened a step. The spot goods were affected by it and fell by 1-2 yuan. It is said that the opening price of 20-count Lanfeng yarn is 322 yuan, plus the consolidated tax. Yesterday, the price of 20-count Shuiyue current yarn was 342 yuan and 5 jiao, and the price of 20-count Lanfeng current yarn was 322 yuan and 5 jiao.

Foreign Cotton Market: The New York cotton market, due to the fall in security prices and the public settlement of 6-7 pounds of sound, Washington is considering using subsidies to export American cotton because of the overproduction of American cotton, in order to remedy this. However, the opposition from Southern congressmen is quite fierce. A meeting was held yesterday, and a new proposal has emerged from Smith's proposal. The meeting has already passed it. The content includes recovering 3 million bales of cotton from government loans. According to the members of the committee, Roosevelt's export subsidy bill will not be passed when it comes to the committee in the future. The overproduction of American cotton, this problem is very serious, and there will be many branches in the future. Yesterday, Indian predicted to fall by 2 rupees, and Egyptian was level. Yesterday, the exchange rate was not very different. Converted to legal tender, American and Brazilian cotton fell by 3 jiao per picul, Indian cotton fell by 6 jiao, and Egyptian cotton remained unchanged.

Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: Because Japanese factories will lose Chinese cotton, and the release period of American cotton has not yet been determined, the Japanese have been purchasing Brazilian cotton in large quantities recently as a precaution.

### Factory Processing Activated, Local Cotton Transactions Improve

The local cotton business, which had been slow for two days, was suddenly active yesterday, but prices fell. The factory processing has been activated. Although fine yarn transactions have been slow in Chinese factories recently, the sales of 10-count coarse yarn have been wide, so the demand for Yao clothing is very healthy. As for Japanese factories opening a large number of cotton yarn and cotton cloth pieces, it is rumored that raw materials are also being replenished, but foreign cotton is the main product, and local white bag cotton is also purchased. It is mixed with it to regulate the spinning. On the one hand, the work efficiency is improved, and on the other hand, the products are bright and clean. As a result, the local cotton trade has improved, and except for Tong cotton, which is slightly soft, other selling prices are not much different from the previous day's prices. 818 bales of Subei to Tongzhou fine lint cotton arrived. 6,280 pieces of cotton arrived from Ningbo yesterday, and 750 pieces of cotton machine flowers also arrived. There are still 30 pieces to be transported to Shantou today. The amount of current cotton transactions and market disk are listed on the left.

### Grain, Current Foreign Flour Depreciates Another Jiao

Factory Flour: The current flour market situation has been in a slump for the past few days. Since the third batch of special-priced sales by the Beiyang merchants opened the night before last, Bingchuan Brand No. 2 flour was priced at 4 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, and Pao Che Brand was only 4 yuan and 3 jiao. The number of transactions in recent days has also been less than 100,000 bags. It is said that in recent days, there has been a lack of Beiyang ship spaces, and the completed goods cannot be shipped as much as possible, resulting in a reduction in the appetite of merchant customers. Yesterday, the Japanese Street also requested a reduction in price by analogy, because the customer base was small. As a result, the wholesale price on this street fell from 4 yuan and 4 jiao and a half yesterday to 4 jiao, 5 fen lower than before. The new transactions then increased to nearly 10,000 bags. However, the Nanyang Merchants' transactions have not yet started. Although the merchant customers of the Fu Shan Merchants have been widely requested, the factory still needs to have a slight distinction between retail and bulk orders, and the brands such as Pao Che and Tianzhu Yuweng are also different. However, the North China market is now able to be served by Japanese and foreign flour. On the surface, there may still be a struggle on the surface.

Foreign Flour: The source of foreign flour is constantly coming in. In addition to the new arrival of more than 40,000 bags from Kung Lee, it is said that there will be another ship coming early next week. The inventory of foreign flour in the market is increasing day by day, and the market price of factory flour has been reduced again and again due to the dumping. Therefore, it is not easy for foreign flour to depreciate and sell well. According to customer discussions, there are currently frequent procedures for foreign flour to pay taxes. If there is no ship space for shipping, it must also compensate for fees such as warehouse rent. Therefore, the customer appetite has gradually become lax in the past few days, only relying on sporadic spot transactions on this street. A total of more than 10,000 bags of Hongri Dangtian and Bat brand flour were opened, priced at 4 yuan and 3 jiao of exchange division, and 4 yuan and 1 jiao of current yarn, which is another jiao smaller than before, and it is driving side by side with factory flour.

Exports: 17,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin today, and 5,000 bags were shipped to Yantai.

### Du Mi Guest Xian: Merchants and Hoarders Are All Watching

A total of fourteen or fifteen numbers of Du rice have arrived from He Xia. The bags delivered by car have only reached 1,500 to 1,600 bags of Su Tongkun Gang. The seller's thoughts are still firm, but the sales ground is stagnant. The street and hoarders are all watching. Each goods is difficult to make an opening, the market barely shows a stalemate. However, such as the thin japonica medium goods, the price is repaired a few points. Du Yangjian, Bu Jian, and the supply and demand of the variable Yin Yuan are similar, and there are no gains or losses.

Customer rice has only a slight response from the local street stores and retail customers. Customer merchants have not had a taste for it for a long time. The trade has also stopped and waited to see. Moreover, there are floating hoards seeking to sell. Therefore, the number of transactions is only 2,200 to 2,300 bags. The market price has rebounded slightly by 4-5 points to nearly Jiao, not uniform. High-quality Jingwu rice has not been traded, and the Wu rice sold in the market is of large market quality, priced at 12 yuan 6 jiao and a half to 12 yuan 7 jiao and a half.

### Oil Cake There Are Rumors That Dalian Has Unified Exports Soybean Oil Surges Sharply Spot Goods Jump Five or Six Jiao Futures Still Have Trading

Regarding the soybean oil market yesterday, the people were weak at the beginning of the morning due to the decline of the Lian Dian. After entering, the Lian city fell sharply by more than a yuan. It was heard that Dalian also had unified export of oil beans, and the people in the market suddenly became restless. The spot market suddenly jumped by five or six jiao, and the futures were also two or three jiao (the order stated, "Irresistible by manpower, can be cancelled"). The system is something that is expected, but it will definitely not be implemented in a short time, or it may be a smokescreen for manipulation, so the trading of futures oil has shown no signs of disappearing, but the transactions in the market have decreased. It is estimated that the transaction of Suifeng factory's canned oil was 500 dan at a price of 32 yuan 5 jiao, Yanqi oil was 30 pieces at 24 yuan, Lianqi was 50 pieces at 31 yuan, and Da Lou Road cargo was 300 pieces, from the old price of 10 yuan 6 jiao, and it soared to 31 yuan 5 jiao. The oil of Fengnian was 50 barrels at 33 yuan 4 jiao. Dalian No. 100 barrels, the price was from 33 yuan 4 jiao to 33 yuan 8 jiao, and the price of 50 barrels in seven days was 33 yuan 3 jiao, and the price of 400 barrels in April was 33 yuan 2 jiao and a half and 6 jiao, and the price of 300 barrels in May was 33 yuan 2 jiao and a half, and 4 jiao.

Today, 500 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Piece Goods State Cloth Sales Are Greatly Affected by the Jiangxi War Market Prices Have Seen a Small Retraction Guerrilla Area Selling East

The wholesale of national cloth in the street has been very busy in the past few days. Clothing companies have a large number of transactions in spring and summer goods, bleached City Mansion silk standard cloth, bleached fine twill, and Buqi cloth. Lun Chang Factory's non-fading ramie is also selling 40 to 50 boxes a day, and the demand from Sichuan and Yunnan merchants is also strong. However, subject to the restrictions on flight hangar capacity, the goods to be loaded are still heavily stocked. Guangdong merchants have newly purchased more than 100 boxes of bleached cloth, City Mansion silk colored cloth and colored twill. Although the taste of Wen and Yong Gang is stagnant, 30 to 40 pieces of white goods and coarse cloth have been added. The Shanghai Exchange rate in Yongdi has also fallen, which cancels each other out. The market price of white goods and fine cloth is falling due to the sluggish sales in Zhejiang and Jiangxi. Yong'an Factory's Dapeng brand has dropped from the highest price of 13 yuan 3 jiao and 5 fen this month to the current market price of 13 yuan 1 jiao. Shenxin Factory's Fugui brand has dropped from 12 yuan 9 jiao and a half to 12 yuan 8 jiao in the current market, and there are still very few people asking. Coarse cloth and fine twill are still actively selling, and the decline is also more moderate. 14-pound goods of coarse cloth are continuously traded in bulk. The market atmosphere is the strongest. The market trend of the remaining stalls yesterday was divergent, with a tendency to fall by 2.5 to 5 fen. Fine twill dyeing factories are looking for low-cost manual goods and purchasing nearly 200 bales. The factory price is 1 or 2 jiao higher per bolt than the market price, so the market price is still stable. The price of bleached, dyed, and printed cloth is also difficult to loosen because most of the grey cloth is firm.

The Dongbu market is stable, but fine twill has fallen by about 5 fen per bolt due to the slight decline in dyeing and sales in this street. However, Qingdao Gang in the north still has an appetite and is purchasing 400 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill. Foreign firm white goods have not been opened, only Abe Shixing sold 50 boxes of Sijunzi Serge, priced at 3 jiao 8 fen 875 per yard, cash, and the current market price must be 3 jiao 9 fen or more. The wholesale in the Hang-Jia-Hu guerrilla area is the most prosperous.

Silky Feather Yarn: The silky feather yarn woven by small Shanghai machine households is used for spring suits. The wholesale price of No. 1 goods is 9 jiao and a half per yard, No. 2 goods is 8 jiao and a half, No. 3 goods is 7 jiao and a half, No. 4 goods is 6 jiao and 7 fen and a half, and No. 5 goods is 5 jiao 8 and 9 fen. The brands of No. 3 and 4 are the most popular. The brands of Daohua and Datong factories are more famous. The width is still 28 inches, and each bolt is 40 to 50 yards long.

Exports

510 pieces of cloth were shipped to Tianjin, 270 pieces to Yantai, 580 pieces to Shantou, 55 pieces to Hong Kong, 280 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 430 pieces to Haiphong. All were exported today.

### Silk and Tea Double Palace Silk Reaches New High Price

Foreign silk prices are mixed. There are ups and downs in New York. The exchange opening price is a small 1 or 2 points. The Yokohama opening market is a small 10 yuan or more. The silk price in Lyon is also rising and falling. The Shanghai silk market is still quiet. A white factory's 20.22 striped poplar returned. The foreign bank's eating price is only 1,600 yuan, so the transaction has stopped again. Only the double palace warp continues to reach new high prices. The 40.60 striped pattern opened at 1,060 yuan. It is estimated that the American bank sold 10 dan. Domestic sales are still weak. The lower body of the serge has a slight zero presentation move. The opening price is 850 yuan.

Yesterday, 269 pieces of Husi and 174 pieces of silk ends were shipped to Mochi. As for tea exports, 434 boxes were shipped to Europe yesterday, and another 10 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong today.

### Sugar Market: Refined White for Re-export Rises Five Cents

Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. The guild set the price for No. 24 Dutch refined white for re-export to rise five cents, with over 400 bags changing hands at $16.70. Spot goods at the local exchange were at $24.85. There were no changes in Dutch red sugar. Taikoo granulated white sugar showed a slight tightening in supply, with Western Exchange goods quoted at $24.80 and Eastern Exchange goods at $24.60. Zhen Ji No. 1 ice sugar was at $31.30. Chaozhou sugar dealers offered over 200 bags of Shantou refined white, with the best quality at $23.50, the next grade at $23.25 to $23.10. Huanggang green sugar was quoted at $14.50, but no transactions took place. Due to dealers' reluctance to increase imports of Diaoqing (a type of green sugar), bids were unrealistic. However, the dealers also felt that lowering prices further would be futile, so they are all taking a wait-and-see approach. It is unlikely that any transactions will occur soon. On the 30th, 279 bags of sugar arrived from Shantou.

### Coal: Hongji Lump Coal Supply Insufficient for Distribution

Hongji white coal continues to show a fluctuating situation. The demand in this area has not increased, but the supply keeps coming in. Normally, there would be no shortage, but because there is more dust than lumps, it feels scarce and therefore more valuable. Recently, one firm had over 5,000 tons arrive, but lump coal only accounted for 30% of that, resulting in insufficient supply on the market for distribution. Backdoor prices have been steadily rising, but the quoted price for Hongji standard coal remains at $45 per ton, and screened lumps at $47. Delivery requires an additional cartage fee, but the gray market price is up by two or three dollars.

Traffic and Transportation Weekly

### The Yunnan-Burma Road: A Mission of the Times – A General Overview

— Bao Cheng

Since the outbreak of the war, twenty months have swiftly passed. Coastal provinces have, one after another, fallen into enemy hands, causing most of China's normal international transportation to be blocked. However, the entire nation, united in purpose, has been diligently working hard, on the one hand, engaging in various war-supporting activities in the rear, dedicating all efforts to inland construction; on the other hand, devoting all strength to international transportation to seek closer ties with foreign countries. To say nothing of other things, even in terms of transportation construction over the past twenty months, both highways and railways have been progressing rapidly, advancing at an astonishing pace. The entire transportation network in the southwest and northwest has been completed in the shortest possible time, which is exciting news. Among these, the most important in terms of international transportation, and which has attracted the attention of the world, is the recently completed Yunnan-Burma Road.

The provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Guangxi are surrounded by high mountains and deep valleys, making transportation routes extremely difficult. In the past, travelers regarded these routes as perilous. However, since the war of resistance began, after more than a year of construction, all inland transportation has become smooth and unhindered, making travel convenient. However, so-called international transportation has always been concentrated in the coastal provinces. Now, apart from the line via Kunming, following the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Haiphong in French Indochina, and the Northwest Highway, which can directly reach Russian Central Asia, there is a feeling that external transportation cannot be developed to its fullest extent. Now, with the completion of the Yunnan-Burma transportation route through collective effort, communication between China and Britain has been realized, which is worthy of national pride, and worthy of attention by both China and foreign countries.

The Yunnan-Burma Road starts from Kunming, the capital of Yunnan, runs through western Yunnan, crosses the Hengduan Mountains, and reaches Bhamo in British Burma, with a total length of over 1,140 kilometers. After more than a year of construction through the cooperation of the military and civilians, it has now been completed and has achieved the goal of being open to traffic. The route travels west from Kunming, passing through Anning, Luquan, Chuxiong, Zhennan, Xiangyun, Fengyi, and reaching Xiaguan in Dali; then turning southwest, crossing the Lancang River, passing through Baoshan and crossing the Nujiang River, then following Longling and Mangshi to reach Wanting on the border between Yunnan and Burma. Starting from Wanting, it enters Burmese territory, covering 170 kilometers to reach Bhamo, the terminal station of the Northern Burmese Railway, and from there, it can connect to Rangoon, the capital of Burma.

The road has now been taken over by the Yunnan-Burma Highway Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, and preparations for passenger and freight transport are actively underway. The bus journey will take six days. The first day starts from Kunming to Chuxiong. The second day from Chuxiong to Xiaguan. The third day from Xiaguan to Yongping. The fourth day from Yongping to Baoshan. The fifth day from Baoshan to Longling. The sixth day starts from Longling and reaches Wanting. Wanting is located at the border of Yunnan and Burma, and currently has no accommodations. From there entering Burmese territory, it reaches Bhamo of North Burma Railway. All along the food and lodging stations, the Administration has entrusted to China Travel Service to undertake, and it is heard that the company has been actively working on the project, and has assigned a large number of capable young people to go to the Yunnan border, to be pioneers for the passengers of the road.

### How to Go to Hunan and Guangxi

— Jing Xun

Those who want to go to Hunan and Guangxi generally believe that taking the route through the ports of eastern Zhejiang, such as Wenzhou or Ningbo, then taking the highway to Jinhua, and then taking the joint transportation service of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Yuehan, and Xiang-Gui railways to Hunan and Guangxi is the most stable, fastest, and most economical route. Therefore, the route has become increasingly crowded. Since the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway stopped operating a few days ago, taking this route is virtually impossible. Now, I will describe another route to Hunan and Guangxi in detail below:

Shanghai to Haiphong: Ships directly sailing there are from Taikoo or Jardine Matheson, with sailings every Monday and Tuesday, passing through Swatow, Hong Kong, Kwangchowan, etc., taking about 10 days. Fares are divided into first-class cabins at 221 or 231 yuan (National currency), second-class first-class cabins at 196 yuan, official cabins at 94 yuan, room cabins at 68 yuan, and steerage at 37 yuan (including landing tax in Haiphong). You can also take a mail ship from Shanghai to Hong Kong, and then transfer to French small Guangdong or Ross vessels and Taikoo or Jardine Matheson ships from Hong Kong to Haiphong, but the fare is more expensive than direct ships.

Haiphong to Hanoi: There are five express trains and five slow trains daily, taking more than two hours by train, with only second and third classes. Second class is 2.10 Vietnamese dollars, and third class is 1.25 Vietnamese dollars. (One Vietnamese dollar is equivalent to 1.70 yuan National currency).

Hanoi to Lang Son: Take the Vietnamese National Railway train to Lang Son, 154 kilometers from Hanoi. The train departs from Hanoi at 5:50 AM and 0:20 PM daily, taking five and a half hours. Fares are 8.88 Vietnamese dollars for first class, 5.92 Vietnamese dollars for second class, and 2.44 Vietnamese dollars for third class.

Lang Son to Longzhou: Longzhou in Guangxi is 80 kilometers from Lang Son, with public buses available, taking about four hours, with fares around 10 yuan National currency.

Longzhou to Nanning: Nanning is 249 kilometers from Longzhou, with highway buses available, taking one day. Lunch is at Suilu, with a fare of 11.35 yuan National currency.

Nanning to Liuzhou: 260 kilometers away, with highway buses available, taking one day. The fare is 11.70 yuan National currency. (From Liuzhou, you can transfer to Guiyang, Chongqing, etc.)

Liuzhou to Guilin: 242 kilometers away, the highway bus takes about six and a half hours. Lunch is at Lipu, and the fare is 10.90 yuan National currency.

Guilin to Hengyang: 354 kilometers away, the Xiang-Gui Railway train runs a special express and a mixed train once a day, taking more than eleven hours. Fares are 5.30 yuan for third class, 10.60 yuan for second class, and 15.90 yuan for first class.

Hengyang to Changsha: 127 kilometers away, you can take the Yuehan Railway train, taking about eight hours. Fares are 2.40 yuan for third class, 4.80 yuan for second class, and 7 yuan for first class.

(Note) To take the above route, you must have a transit passport through Vietnam and an identification certificate from your employer or business.

### Things to Note When Passing Through Vietnam

— Jing

Since the interruption of transportation from Hong Kong to the mainland, passing through French Indochina into the mainland has become a well-known, fastest and safest transportation route for Chinese people! Before the War of Resistance, this route was only used by those who wanted to do business or return to their hometowns in Vietnam or Yunnan Province. The general public was unfamiliar with it. Therefore, although this route is now known as a main route to the mainland, most travelers going to the mainland via Vietnam are still first-timers! The transportation situation from Vietnam to Yunnan Province or other places has often been recorded in detail in newspapers, so there is no need to repeat it here. What follows are some things to note:

1.  Passport: Any traveler who wants to go to the mainland and pass through Vietnam must prepare a passport issued by the Chinese government in advance and have it stamped with a transit visa by the French consulate before setting off. After the ship leaves Hong Kong, the passports held must be handed over to the ship's steward, and after arriving in Haiphong, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce can be entrusted to collect them on their behalf. (See last issue for details) When entering the country at Hekou, the identity certificate should be submitted for verification. If there are any doubts, the inspection agency will telegraph the agency or business that issued the certificate to inquire, and will only allow entry after receiving a reply. Therefore, before departure, one should never be negligent about the identity certificate.

2.  Luggage: Vietnamese customs are very strict in inspecting passengers' luggage. Any new items, such as silk, satin, wool, cloth, clothing, cosmetics, etc., will be taxed according to the transit tax rate (1% for domestic goods, 4% for foreign goods). If travelers have newly purchased items, they may wish to take them out as much as possible and put them together, so that when they arrive at customs, they can point them out themselves, wait for the customs officer to review them, and pay the tax that should be paid, and the rest of the luggage can be checked more simply. If new items are secretly wrapped in bedding or clothing lining and are discovered, they will be considered as intentionally evading taxes, and the luggage will be detained and severely punished. Therefore, when carrying bedding, it is best not to sew up one end of the bedding to avoid trouble during inspection. As for lighters, cigarettes, and other prohibited items, they are absolutely prohibited from being brought in.

3.  Wharf: The situation at Haiphong wharf is very chaotic. Passengers should pay special attention. If there are important items, they should be locked in large boxes or wallets, because there are many pickpockets in this port, especially for hats, fountain pens, or pencils, etc. If they are stolen, it will be even more difficult to deal with in this unfamiliar place where the language is not understood, and there are very few sentries and police officers at the port. It is best to travel together and take care of each other. The means of transportation in the urban area of the port are mostly rickshaws. The fare is 5 Vietnamese cents for closer destinations and 10 cents for farther destinations.

4.  Language: The common languages in Vietnam are French, Vietnamese, and Cantonese. Travelers here suffer a lot because they don't understand the language. Generally, people think that English can be used, but this is not the case. Fortunately, China Travel Service has dispatchers at the train station and pier to take care of everything. If there is a time when the language is not understood between the two parties, you can ask the company's dispatcher to translate.

5.  Climate: The climate in Haiphong is very warm. It is already possible to wear single-layer clothing now. When travelers arrive in Haiphong, don't lock up your winter clothes just because the climate is warm, because if you take the train to Kunming, the climate is very cold after the train passes Yongmai. At that time, you can put on the winter clothes you brought to keep warm. As for the climate in Kunming, it is very cool in the morning and evening, and the average temperature is around 70 degrees Celsius at noon.

6.  Diet: The diet in various parts of Vietnam is mostly Western food. The bread used is extremely hard, which people here are not used to. If you want to eat Chinese food, Cantonese cuisine is also available there. When taking the train, meals are not provided on the train, and everything needs to be brought with you. Yunnan and other places in Vietnam, such as Lao Cai, produce a lot of vegetables and fruits at very cheap prices, but do not buy and eat the local fruits, because these fruits are exposed to miasma while growing on the trees, and eating them can easily cause illness. As for food, it is best to bring your own.

### New York Summer Camp

— Xu Jun

The American government is holding a summer camp in Flushing Meadow Park, Borough of Queens, New York. All the buildings and scenic areas occupy a vast area of 1,216 acres. In addition to the existing railways and highways that can all directly reach the camp, making transportation very convenient, a new highway directly reaching the camp has now been built. The purpose of this summer camp is divided into two major categories: (1) to provide tourists with a place to escape the summer heat, (2) to invite countries to transport their famous goods for exhibition or sale.

The opening date is approaching, starting from April 30th of this year, for a fixed period of six months, and will close on October 30th of this year. Within the camp area, the government health department also has medical consultants and insurance banks and other agencies, the scope is very great. For travelers departing from China or from Hong Kong to participate, the camp has designated China Travel Service to handle passport procedures for them, and all steamer tickets and train tickets through the mainland to the United States are also sold by China Travel Service. The company also handles export procedures for luggage and goods. In addition, those who are going to New York to visit this summer camp should first prepare a tourist passport and apply for an unlimited immigrant entry permit, which the company can also handle in the same way. Finally, the US government allows imported goods that are only exhibited and not sold within the camp to be exempt from import duties.

### Special Features of the Studebaker Champion Car

The Studebaker Champion car produced by the Studebaker factory will arrive in Shanghai in mid-month. The new car has been rigorously tested on roads throughout the United States, under different environmental conditions, for four years before it was successfully announced. Therefore, whether in terms of internal content, appearance, or any aspect, it is worthy of being a masterpiece of the Studebaker factory.

The Champion car is a completely new vehicle, and has not used any parts of other vehicles. Its design and construction are entirely aimed at economic use as the sole purpose, and the selling price is very low. It is truly the most exquisite vehicle in the lowest price range.
