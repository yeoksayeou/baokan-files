(Hong Kong) The situation in Beihai is tense again, with an increase in Japanese warships nearby and Japanese soldiers attempting to land. The Japanese troops surrounding Weizhou Island are also increasing their defenses, preparing to invade. The Chinese side claims that the increased defenses on Weizhou Island pose a great threat to Vietnam but have little relation to an attack on Beihai. The inland areas of Hainan Island have been subjected to indiscriminate bombing by Japanese planes in recent days, resulting in many casualties among Chinese civilians. (Special dispatch, 10th afternoon)

Zhaoqing: At 8 a.m. on the 9th, Japanese troops launched a fierce attack on Zhongshan, forcibly landing at Gushi, attempting to seize Shiqi. More than thirty Chinese garrison units, along with local militias, repelled and ambushed them. Fierce fighting continued until late at night. (Dispatch, 10th)

Zhaoqing: On the morning of the 9th, the Japanese troops attacking Zhongshan, numbering four to five hundred, set off from Jimen North Street at dawn, aboard two shallow-water warships, three electric boats, and forty motorboats, heading for Kushi via Gu Zhen Ai, constantly shelling the coast. Three Japanese planes simultaneously flew in, conducting frenzied bombing. Under the cover of intense firepower from the sea and air, the Japanese soldiers suddenly launched a forced landing in the Kushi area. Chinese garrison troops defended the river steadfastly, calmly engaging the enemy, repeatedly inflicting heavy losses on the landing Japanese troops. (Dispatch, 10th)

(Hong Kong) The Japanese troops in Chao'an have increased by nearly a thousand, while there are more than two thousand Japanese troops in Jiangmen and Xinhui, and more than three hundred Japanese troops in North Street. Yesterday and today, they have been under fierce siege by Chinese troops, suffering many casualties. The Japanese army appears to be preparing to withdraw. The Japanese troops in Hebei, Guangzhou, have mostly retreated to Henan, with many wounded and sick. (Special dispatch, 10th)

(Guangzhou) According to reports from Chinese people, fierce fighting broke out last night in the waterways leading to Shiqi. Chinese troops opened fire with machine guns on advancing Japanese ships. At dawn, the Japanese ships retreated. It is reported that Japanese planes were very active yesterday, flying to the scene of last night's battle. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

(Hong Kong) It is rumored that Japanese aircraft pilots in Guangzhou are plotting to rebel. The incident was exposed, and more than sixty people were arrested and sent to Japan. (Special dispatch, 10th) The Chinese counter-attacking forces are still making progress. (Special dispatch, 10th)

The next day, forty Japanese planes retaliated against the Li people in the Wuzhi Mountains, bombing them all day and killing more than two thousand Li people. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)

Xingji: Most of the fighting in Shanxi Province has been quiet. More than five thousand Japanese troops recently moved from northern Shanxi through Zihongkou towards Qin County. Judging from the movements of the Japanese army, they seem to be attempting to control southeastern Shanxi, so as to join forces with the Japanese troops in southern Hebei to attack the Taihang Mountains and break through the base areas of the Chinese guerrillas, thus ensuring the safety of the Pinghan Railway. (Dispatch, 10th)

Xingji: Various routes in eastern Shanxi have seen frequent engagements.

### Japanese Side Announces: War Situation on the Outer Mongolian Border; Japanese Troops Encounter Difficulties in the Delta; Heavy Artillery Battles on Both Banks of the Halha River

(Tokyo) Today, this station received a Japanese military dispatch stating: "The 'Manchukuo'-Japanese allied forces are currently 'clearing out' the remnants of Soviet-Mongolian troops south of the Hölsten River and on the Balshagah Heights north of the river. The delta between the Hölsten and Halha Rivers is scattered with swamps and sand dunes, making it difficult for the Japanese army to advance. Yesterday, both sides exchanged artillery fire throughout the day. The Soviet-Mongolian artillery on the west bank of the Halha River opened fire at 8 a.m., and the Japanese artillery immediately returned fire. Air battles and tank battles also ensued. Both the Japanese and Soviet artillery demonstrated their power. Some Soviet shells landed behind Japanese positions, as far as the vicinity of the Japanese field hospital. At 1 p.m., a Japanese bomber squadron, assisted by a fighter squadron, appeared in the skies over the battlefield, bombing the Soviet-Mongolian positions on the west bank of the Halha River. At 7 p.m., after the Japanese fighter planes left the battle zone, twelve Soviet bombers flew to the area between the Japanese field hospital and the first line of battle and dropped bombs. The Japanese side immediately opened fire with anti-aircraft guns and dispatched fighter planes to intercept them. It is reported that the Soviet planes hurriedly dropped their bombs and fled back to the Mongolian border. At around 9 p.m., the Soviet artillery positions on the west bank of the Halha River reopened fire, but without any clear targets. It is reported that the Japanese army captured more than fifty tanks and armored vehicles, as well as a large number of guns, including three 15cm shrapnel howitzers and two field guns. The captured shrapnel howitzers were all in good condition. The Japanese army used them to bombard the Soviet-Mongolian troops who were fleeing across the Halha River, inflicting heavy losses on them. A thousand Soviet soldiers, carrying forty tanks and more than a hundred armored vehicles, retreated to the west bank of the river under heavy Japanese artillery fire, abandoning more than six hundred corpses. At the same time, more than a hundred damaged Soviet tanks and armored vehicles were also abandoned in the delta region between the Halha and Hölsten Rivers. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

(Hong Kong) Tokyo Japanese dispatch: At 1 p.m. today, Japanese planes engaged in another air battle with Soviet planes over the Halha River on the "Manchukuo"-Soviet border. One Japanese plane has not yet returned to its base. (Dispatch, 10th)

### Third Countries Need Not Mediate Between China and Japan - Wang Chonghui's Opinion - China's Open Door Policy Remains Unchanged - Japan's Interests Often Conflict with Those of Third Countries

(Chongqing) Chinese Foreign Minister Dr. Wang Chonghui told an Associated Press reporter today that it is not necessary for third countries to mediate between China and Japan at this time. If China were to conclude a peace agreement with Japan based on Japanese conditions, conflicts between Japan and the interests of third countries would still occur from time to time, and there would be no peace. As for China's position, it is very clear. China's policy is the Open Door, and its future policy will remain the Open Door. As for the current issue, it is not only a matter of China's independence and freedom but also a matter of the rights and interests of third countries. The most fundamental aspect of this is the issue of the Nine-Power Treaty's guarantee of China's territorial integrity, the Open Door, and equal trade for all countries. Therefore, countries with interests here are also involved. The interests of third countries cannot be interfered with. Therefore, the issue of the rights and interests of Japan and third countries is not something that China can or should intervene in. In the future, Japan need not respect the rights and interests of third countries. If third countries can adopt a united policy to exert pressure on Japan, it can not only protect the rights and interests of other countries. Regarding the current Anglo-Japanese negotiations, Wang stated that these negotiations are likely to fail. On the one hand, the views of the two sides are too far apart. At the same time, the UK wishes to treat the matter as a local incident, but Japan hopes to gain far greater issues through this negotiation. Wang also said that the reason why the Anglo-Japanese talks are so difficult is because the Japanese views are entirely controlled by Japanese military cliques. Regarding the situation after the breakdown of the Anglo-Japanese conference, Wang believes that Japan is likely to threaten to occupy the concessions by force. However, Wang does not believe that Japan can truly do so, as such action would be too reckless. Wang firmly believes that the UK will refuse to discuss the various issues that Japan hopes for, as the UK has no right to discuss issues related to other countries. Therefore, these Anglo-Japanese negotiations are bound to fail. However, if the UK yields to Japan, Japan will shift its demands to other areas. Speaking of the US neutrality issue, Wang believes that this case will be debated at length in the Senate. The current neutrality law clearly hinders the US government's responsibility for world affairs. Credit loans, with a term of only three months, are greatly unfavorable to China. As for the provisions on banning the export of arms, they will harm Britain and France if a European war breaks out. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)

Editorial

### Observing the Tokyo Negotiations

The UK and Japan decided to hold negotiations in Tokyo over the issue of Japanese troops blockading the British concession in Tianjin half a month ago. We commented at the time that these negotiations would inevitably be "protracted and inconclusive." Now, half a month has passed, and the negotiations have not yet begun, let alone completed. We do not rejoice in our accurate prediction but are apprehensive about the bleak future.

The UK wants to limit the scope of the Tianjin issue to a local incident. Not only have British officials, both directly and indirectly, expressed this view, but they have also revealed some subtle diplomatic tactics. The idea is that if Japan agrees that the issue is a local incident, then the UK will naturally be happy to seek a solution. Otherwise, involving the interests of the US and France, the UK has no right to make any decisions with Japan alone. In other words, if Japan wants to expand the scope of the Tianjin issue, then the UK, US, and France will have to work together to deal with Japan.

On the Japanese side, it has been said that the UK must accept the broad principles proposed by Japan, that is, the UK must change its attitude and abandon its pro-China policy. Otherwise, the Tokyo negotiations will have no results. However, the specific conditions for resolving the dispute will, of course, focus on the Tianjin issue. Assuming that we are not being paranoid, then we can infer that the so-called "must" is a pretense, a reversal, while the so-called "specific conditions focused on the Tianjin issue" implicitly accepts the British-advocated "local incident" principle.

The diplomatic qualities of the UK and Japan have always been known for their subtlety. Only last year when Japan resolved the Zhanggufeng Incident with the Soviet Union, and the UK signed the Munich Agreement with Germany, were they comparatively straightforward, which were exceptions. Because of this mutual appreciation for subtlety, coupled with the international situation in Europe and the political brewing in the Far East, there are many factors that give both sides room for fantasy. Therefore, no matter how the local incident principle proposed by the UK is ultimately implemented, it is not enough to optimistically predict the future of the Tokyo negotiations. But look at how the Japanese authorities, on the one hand, quietly say that the conditions for a resolution focus on the Tianjin issue; on the other hand, they create many well-organized and mechanical anti-British rallies both in Japan and in the militarily occupied areas of China, making a great show, booming and bustling, seemingly with the unanimous support of the people, and a soaring arrogance, enough to discourage political hypocrites and make them shrink back. It can be seen that although Japanese politicians do not expect any unexpected gains from the Tokyo negotiations, they still put on a show as much as possible, regardless of whether it is effective or not. Yesterday, they even used an informal and irresponsible way to publicize the so-called eight basic policies for the Tokyo negotiations: (1) Demand that the UK change its policies in all aspects of politics and economics; (2) Demand that the UK recognize the new political situation in East Asia; (3) Hand over all anti-Japanese terrorists and communist elements in the British concession in Tianjin; (4) Accept the cooperation of Japanese police and Japanese military police to maintain peace and order; (5) Prohibit the circulation of legal tender in the British concession; (6) Hand over 50 million yuan of silver belonging to Chinese banks in the concession; (7) Recognize the Japanese side's right to inspect Chinese banks and exchange shops; (8) Prohibit and curb anti-Japanese propaganda. This is truly the culmination of bargaining and an important posture on the eve of the start of negotiations!

We are just like some British politicians in their feelings: for example, former British Prime Minister Lloyd George said in a speech in Weaverham, UK, the other day that the UK's handling of the Tianjin incident has become a laughing stock among Europe and America, and that the British cabinet has lost its head; there are many, many expressions of dissatisfaction and unease like this, and it is certainly not just Lloyd George alone. Sometimes, we feel the same dissatisfaction and unease. But according to general morality and general reason, we also believe that the Chamberlain cabinet will not repeatedly break faith and disappoint people again and again. The Chamberlain cabinet once used a strong tone, stating that British foreign policy will never accept dictated orders; this certainly does not mean that it will only refuse to accept orders from Germany, but exceptionally be willing to accept dictation from Japan. But Japan wants the UK to accept as many as eight items of dictation!

We firmly believe that the UK will not regard the Tokyo negotiations as an opportunity to practice dictation; at the same time, we hope that the UK deeply recognizes that if Japan uses the opening of the Yangtze River for Anglo-Japanese cooperation as bait to get the UK to temporarily accept dictation, then what will be the psychology of all Chinese people towards the UK? How will the resentment provoked by reaction compare to other kinds of resentment? As for negotiations that exceed the scope of local incidents, the UK has to invite the US and France to work together. The UK may think that Japan does not want to risk such impropriety, so it tries to avoid the realization of joint efforts for the sake of Japan. In fact, after two years of war, the UK, France, and the US working together to deal with Japan may be what saves Japan from its desire to stop but its inability to do so; at least from the perspective of the overall situation in the Far East, it will surely have the function of stabilizing the Far East. If the UK can deeply recognize this, we firmly believe that the Tokyo negotiations will be more meaningful and make a greater contribution.

### The Overall War Situation Will Soon Change - Feng Yuxiang Talks with Huitong News Agency Reporter - China Rushes to Train New Troops and Organize Resources - Conduct Counter-offensive to Change the Situation

(Chongqing) General Feng Yuxiang, Deputy Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, met individually with Mr. M. M. Most, Far East General Manager of Huitong News Agency, yesterday and stated that although Japan's military equipment is superior to China's, the main principle of war is not just about military equipment. Therefore, the overall war situation will undergo significant changes soon. China is currently rushing to train new troops and organize resources, and will soon launch a counter-offensive to change the situation. For example, the recent setbacks suffered by the Japanese side in northwestern Hubei are clear evidence of this development. The Japanese army has lost 250 kilometers of territory, suffered 20,000 casualties, and countless military aircraft have been captured. The Japanese army in the Zhongtiao Mountains in Shanxi has launched nine attacks without any gains. Every day, 500 to 1,500 coffins of Japanese officers and soldiers are transported from the Baoding Railway. Feng continued that the Chinese authorities have received reliable information that 5,000 Japanese intellectuals have been put on trial by the Japanese government for demanding an immediate ceasefire. As a result, more than 400 people have been imprisoned and questioned. Other Japanese officials and civilians are tired of the war. According to reports received, Japanese soldiers on various fronts have recently shown great friendliness to the Chinese people, and some have even sworn allegiance to Chinese old women as adoptive mothers and vowed not to return to Japan. As for the Chinese side, morale is extremely strong. The army is entirely trained by Chinese officers and is well-equipped. When the Huitong reporter asked which units of the Chinese army are the best, Feng replied that the troops fighting around Yichang, as well as the new troops trained in Sichuan, Hunan, and Guizhou provinces, are the best in terms of combat effectiveness and fighting spirit. Finally, Feng said, "Therefore, all sacrifices are not in vain. The Chinese people have a deep belief in this, so they will continue the war of resistance until final victory."

### Japanese Planes Bomb Huangyan City Rampantly - Badong Also Suffers Air Raids

Jinhua: On the 10th, six Japanese bombers raided Huangyan County at 8:13 a.m., bombing the city indiscriminately, dropping a total of 25 bombs, killing 10 people, injuring 9 people, and destroying 197 houses. (Dispatch, 10th)

(Yichang) On the evening of the 6th, Badong was bombed for the first time. Nine Japanese planes sneaked into the city around 11 p.m. and dropped seven bombs, three of which landed in the river and four in the city, none of which exploded, so there were no losses. (Dispatch, 10th)

### Tokyo Anglo-Japanese Negotiations May Be Postponed - The UK Tries to Avoid Expanding the Scope - The Japanese Army Proposes Basic Policies

(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese talks on the Tianjin issue in Tokyo may be postponed until next week. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said this morning while hosting reporters that the Japanese government's discussion on the preparations for the Anglo-Japanese conference may take some time, so he could not confirm that the meeting could begin this week. Yesterday, officials from the Foreign and Army Ministries and representatives from Tianjin held a discussion, but it was informal and had no concrete results. It is said that a formal discussion will be held this afternoon. When reporters asked whether the Japanese government had responded to British Ambassador Craigie's two protests against the killing of British citizen Ding Gele by Japanese sailors in Pudong on June 6, the spokesman replied that he knew the matter was being handled in Shanghai. According to Reuters, the Japanese Foreign Ministry has not yet sent a reply to the British Embassy. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

(London) The Times today commented on the upcoming Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo, reiterating that only local issues related to Tianjin are appropriate for discussion. If it is proposed to expand the scope of issues, such as the general principles applicable to foreign concessions in various Chinese ports, it will not only affect the UK but also involve other countries. After listing various pieces of evidence that Japan has not succeeded two years after the war, the newspaper said that the Japanese people have not yet understood the intricate relationship of China's determination to resist. The failure to calculate has created a big mistake. In the eyes of the soldiers who made the mistake, foreigners are obviously scapegoats. However, the real reason for the prolongation of the war can only be attributed to a psychological error on the part of the Japanese General Staff. They now seem to be turning China into a kind of nation, just as Napoleon and his army and puppet government turned the historically divided and indifferent Germany into a nation determined to get rid of foreign control. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

(Tokyo) Today, Japanese newspapers, seemingly under official instruction, continued to express Japan's "fundamental determination" in the upcoming Tianjin issue negotiations, demanding that the UK abandon its "pro-Chiang policy" and strictly maintain neutrality. On this point, Miyako Shimbun stated that the Foreign Ministry has decided to accept the basic principles drafted by the Army Ministry. It is reported that the basic policies of the Army Ministry are: (1) Demand that the UK change its policies in all aspects of politics and economics; (2) Demand that the UK recognize the new political situation in East Asia; (3) Hand over all anti-Japanese terrorists and communist elements in the British concession in Tianjin; (4) Accept the cooperation of Japanese police and Japanese military police to maintain peace and order; (5) Prohibit the circulation of legal tender in the British concession; (6) Hand over 50 million yuan of silver belonging to Chinese banks in the concession; (7) Recognize the Japanese side's right to inspect Chinese banks and exchange shops; (8) Prohibit and curb anti-Japanese propaganda. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

(Tianjin) Regarding the Japanese actions of searching British people, after several days of easing, they have become stricter again today. At the Race Course Road intersection, four British people were searched by Japanese sentries for as long as forty minutes. One of them even had his shoes and socks taken off. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)

(London) Under-Secretary Butler declared in the House of Commons today, in response to a question from Labour MP Henderson, that the Japanese government has not formally presented its recent declaration by its Prime Minister Hiranuma concerning all the reservations in the upcoming Tokyo Anglo-Japanese talks. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

(London) At the meeting of the House of Commons today, members again focused on the situation in Tianjin. Under-Secretary Butler, in answering questions, recounted that Prime Minister Chamberlain had told the House that the Tokyo negotiations would be conducted in accordance with the British government's push for an end to the atrocities perpetrated on the British people. These negotiations are expected to begin in the middle of next week. Judging from the information received by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, some British people in Tianjin are now passing through obstacles, and the crackdown is not as troublesome as before. Conservative MP Sir Knox rose to speak, saying that action should of course be taken to stop the atrocities, and asked whether the UK's prestige in the Far East was in danger of being lost. The Under-Secretary replied that Knox should know that the situation has improved after the UK government's negotiations. Labour MP Fletcher rose to say that the UK government hopes that the atrocities perpetrated on the British people will end, but did not mention hoping that the blockade of Tianjin would end. The Under-Secretary replied that the UK government's attitude on this issue was stated by the Prime Minister on June 28. Fletcher then asked, "Is it true that the conditions regarding the blockade were not mentioned?" The Under-Secretary replied, "Yes, the situation is as Mr. Chamberlain said." Labour MP Noel-Baker asked whether the government could assure the House that if the negotiations began, the government would take no action that would harm the rights enjoyed by the Japanese government under international law, or recognize the legitimacy of the Japanese demands. The Under-Secretary replied, "I can give that assurance." (Reuters dispatch, 10th)

### Supplementary Measures for Honoring the Descendants of the Loyal and Brave

(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang is deeply concerned about the families of fallen soldiers and, in addition to the established procedures for various compensation regulations, has specially formulated several measures to supplement them: (1) Commanders of all units must promptly report the facts of death of their subordinates, as well as their ancestral origins and family circumstances, and quickly apply for compensation. No delays or backlogs are allowed. If the family situation is unclear in the existing records, a formal request should be sent to the original government for a detailed investigation and report. Do not delay due to negligence or arbitrarily postpone, so as to avoid omissions. (2) Local governments at all levels, when approving the compensation for the families of fallen soldiers, must issue the funds as soon as they arrive, regardless of financial difficulties. No excuses or delays are allowed. If such delays are discovered or reported by the families, severe punishment will be imposed without leniency. All families are allowed to report these facts to the Military Council Compensation Committee at any time to apply for prompt payment. (3) If any family is certain that their children have died in battle but has not received the compensation approval, they are allowed to directly report to the Compensation Committee, which will instruct the relevant unit commanders to investigate and apply for compensation. (4) If any family does not understand the written language or is unwilling to go through the compensation and payment procedures, the local Baotjia heads, gentry, or educators should voluntarily assist them in handling the matter if they are aware of it. Alternatively, in accordance with the preferential treatment measures for the families of soldiers on expeditions, local enthusiastic and capable individuals should find ways to maintain their livelihoods. This should be regarded as a supplement to Chairman Chiang's secret telegram to national gentry and educators on January 19, and earnestly promoted. If local governments and Baotjia personnel deliberately embezzle the compensation due to the families, they will be severely punished upon verification, regardless of the amount. (5) For families in occupied areas where administrative power cannot reach to provide relief, the local Baotjia and fellow villagers should remember that the martyrs died for the sake of protecting the country and defending the people, and should especially care for the descendants of the loyal and brave. They should either jointly raise funds to provide materials to support their lives, or take turns to help them with farming, so that they can avoid starvation and cold. After the recovery of the lost territories, in addition to the government verifying and compensating their families in accordance with the regulations, the families are also allowed to report the assistance provided by the Baotjia heads and neighbors, and the government will separately commend them to promote morality. (6) All civil and military personnel from central party, government, and military organs who are sent to the front and rear to inspect and review should immediately visit the relatives of fallen soldiers in each place they visit. They should inquire whether they have received the compensation they should have received in accordance with the regulations, and whether the preferential treatment laws and regulations have been effectively implemented by local governments and people. The actual situation should be reported to the Chairman for verification. The original sending organs of the central government should also include this as one of the assessment criteria for the diligence and merit of the dispatched personnel. (9th dispatch)

### Chiang Kai-shek Pledges Assistance to the People of Southern Shanxi

(Chongqing) According to news from here today, in the recent fierce battles in Southern Shanxi, more than 2,000 civilians died, and many survivors lost everything. The autumn harvest is also hopeless. Chairman Chiang has pledged to find ways to assist the people of Southern Shanxi. Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, advocated donating a percentage of his salary each month to relieve the refugees in China. (10th Associated Press dispatch)

### Tripartite Mutual Assistance Negotiations: Soviet Union Proposes New Methods; Striving to Avoid the Appearance of Interference in Other Countries' Foreign Policies; Molotov Meets with British and French Envoys; Lengthy Talks Yield No Concrete Results

(Moscow) Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov held another meeting today with British Ambassador Seeds, French Ambassador Naggiar, and British Foreign Office Special Envoy Strang, holding closed-door talks for two hours and fifty minutes. Since the start of the tripartite anti-aggression pact negotiations, this was the longest meeting. (9th Reuters dispatch)

(Moscow) Molotov again met today with British Ambassador Seeds, French Ambassador Naggiar, and British Foreign Office Special Envoy Strang for more than two hours, but no affirmative results were obtained. (9th TASS dispatch)

(Moscow) French Ambassador to the Soviet Union Naggiar, British Ambassador Seeds, and Strang, Director of the Central European Department of the British Foreign Office, jointly visited Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov this afternoon, holding talks for more than two hours. The duration was unprecedented since Strang's arrival in Moscow. The discussions reportedly concerned the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic states, as well as the issues of the Netherlands and Switzerland. Observers here claim that the two sides have been holding talks daily for the past three days, which shows that the negotiations are indeed progressing. However, due to the different aspects involved and the many issues, it will be several days before a definite result can be obtained. (9th Havas dispatch)

(London) Regarding the progress of the tripartite negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Seeds recently submitted a report to the government. Prime Minister Chamberlain intends to convene the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee within days to discuss it, possibly as early as tomorrow. Official circles refused to disclose the contents of the report and warned newspapers not to publish news prematurely before the time is ripe to avoid causing various inconveniences. According to well-informed sources, the Soviet government has proposed a new approach, striving to avoid the appearance of interference in the foreign policies of the guaranteed countries. The Soviet government seems eager to actively cooperate with Britain and France to establish an agreement as soon as possible. This situation has not been seen before. The reason is that the British government warned the Soviet government that Britain's concessions on the issue of mutual assistance when a third country is subjected to aggression have reached their limit. Soviet sources here advocate that Poland and Turkey should conclude mutual assistance agreements with the Soviet Union, saying that this would greatly benefit the peace front. (9th Havas dispatch)

(London) Well-informed sources here recently claimed that the British authorities are currently drafting a new plan in case the current negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union fail. The diplomatic correspondent of the "Daily Mail" said that the tripartite negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union may completely fail, and the result will not change the current situation in Poland. (10th Haitong dispatch)

(London) When the House of Commons met today, Labour MP Dalton and Conservative MP Adams successively raised inquiries about the progress of the negotiations on the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied that after the British and French governments separately telegraphed new instructions to their ambassadors in the Soviet Union, the two ambassadors continued their talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Foreign Minister Molotov immediately put forward some new proposals, which are now being studied by the British and French governments. However, the Soviet government has not yet responded to certain points in the proposals put forward by Britain and France. Another MP then asked what the government's attitude was regarding the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic states. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "Respect for the territorial integrity and sovereign independence of small countries is Britain's basic policy. As for Finland and the Baltic states, the British government is well aware that these countries are willing to maintain their independence and neutrality, and this is what the British government hopes for. Therefore, the British government will certainly take this into account in the current negotiations." Chamberlain also replied to Conservative MP Adams' inquiry that the government has no intention of sending Foreign Secretary Halifax to Moscow at this time. Adams then asked, "Would sending a British cabinet member to Moscow satisfy Oliver Twist (the protagonist in Charles Dickens' novel "Oliver Twist," known for his insatiable appetite, referring to the Soviet Union making progress step by step)?" The MPs burst into laughter upon hearing this. (10th Havas dispatch)

(Paris) According to news from French diplomatic circles, the talks between the British and French ambassadors and the British Foreign Office representative in Moscow with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on Saturday and Sunday seem to indicate a gap in opinions between France and the Soviet Union. These talks will continue for some time. (10th Reuters dispatch)

(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain said in the House of Commons today that the British and French governments have recently issued instructions to their representatives in Moscow. The British and French representatives have continued to discuss the two resolutions with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Certain proposals put forward by the Soviet Union are currently being considered. (10th Reuters dispatch)

### German General Staff Exaggerates Aircraft Numbers

(London) The Standard Evening News recently published news, reportedly obtained from the most reliable sources in Hungary, stating that the German General Staff has notified the Hungarian authorities that Germany has a total of 34,000 military aircraft. The Hungarian side believes that this includes training aircraft, inferior quality aircraft, or older models. There are also 100,000 German pilots, but many of them have not received adequate training. (10th Havas dispatch)

### US Republican Congressman Opposes Buying Foreign Silver; Roosevelt Should Use It as a Weapon Against Those Who Harm US Interests

(Washington) Republican Senator Townsend, who recently introduced a bill to suspend the purchase of foreign silver, which is being discussed by the Senate Finance Subcommittee, told the press yesterday, "If friends of foreign silver believe that our country should give Mexico a disguised subsidy or loan, they should ask Congress to approve it. If the American people want to lend or give money to Mexico or any other country, it should also be decided by Congress. Economically speaking, the current silver purchase law is abnormal. If we maintain it at the request of foreign governments, it is equivalent to being defrauded and willingly succumbing, which is unacceptable." Since 1933, the United States has purchased $237,000,000 worth of silver from Latin American countries, of which $217,000,000 was produced by Mexico. What has been the result of the US purchase of Mexican silver in the past six years is obvious to all. (9th Havas)

(New York) The New York Post Forum recently commented on the US policy of purchasing silver from foreign countries, saying, "There are many things about this policy that can be criticized, but it is not without benefit to oppress those countries when American interests in other countries are threatened." "There is no reason for our country to buy silver from foreign countries. If the government is determined to continue to implement this policy, it should be given full power, with conditions attached. What are the conditions? If the attitude of foreign governments is not conducive to American interests, and they take illegal actions, such as arbitrarily confiscating American assets, President Roosevelt should immediately use the power to buy silver as a weapon to oppress them, and when necessary, stop buying silver from those countries." (9th Havas)

(London) The Daily Mail recently published an editorial, stating, "This week is a critical moment for President Roosevelt. The President's second term is about to expire, and his personal power has declined. It is not known whether his policy of assisting democratic countries can continue to be implemented. However, once war breaks out, American public opinion will quickly change and prompt Congress to take action, so that President Roosevelt's actions today will be consistent from beginning to end." (10th Havas)

(London) The issue of whether the United States should suspend the purchase of foreign silver is still under debate between Congress and the government. The silver market here has been greatly affected. There was a wave of selling at the opening, and buyers were insufficient, causing the price of silver to fall. Later, India bought some on the dip, and the market situation recovered. According to silver market officials, the current market price is still half a penny lower than the US purchase price. If the US government lowers the purchase price to be on par with the London market price, the London market price will continue to fall tomorrow. However, if the US maintains the current price, sellers may rush to replenish their positions, and the market price may rise sharply. (10th Havas dispatch)

### British Cabinet Reshuffle Postponed Indefinitely Due to Churchill's Unpopularity

(London) Regarding the rumors of a cabinet reshuffle, the Daily Mail recently reported, "A noteworthy situation has arisen within the Conservative Party. Many party members have requested a large-scale cabinet reshuffle, especially at the end of last week. Prime Minister Chamberlain also had this intention a week or two ago. Today, the Prime Minister has decided to postpone the cabinet reshuffle indefinitely, regardless of everything. The reason is that those who advocate a cabinet reshuffle all support Churchill, the leader of the far-right wing of the Conservative Party, to join the cabinet. However, no one has paid attention to what position he should hold. Prime Minister Chamberlain therefore had a feeling that once Churchill joined the cabinet, no matter what position he held, most members of the Conservative Party would see him as controlling the power of the cabinet. The proposal for a cabinet reshuffle became a provocative act against Prime Minister Chamberlain himself, so he decided to maintain the status quo, and Churchill was therefore disadvantaged."

### Belgian Air Force Anniversary; German Aviator Dies

(Belgian Capital) Today is the 25th anniversary of the founding of the Belgian Air Force.

### Chamberlain Reaffirms British Attitude Toward Danzig Situation; If Polish Independence is Clearly Threatened, Britain Will Fulfill Its Promise to Provide Assistance

(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain made a highly anticipated statement on Danzig in the House of Commons today, saying that we have assured Poland that if its independence is clearly threatened and it believes it necessary to resist with all its national strength, we will provide assistance. We have now decided to implement this guarantee. I have previously stated that the British government has maintained close contact with the French and Polish governments regarding the Danzig issue. I have no more to add to the information I have previously released regarding the situation there. However, I will make a useful review of the factors of this issue seen by the British government. In terms of race, Danzig is almost entirely a German city, but the prosperity of its residents largely depends on Polish trade. The Vistula River is Poland's only waterway to the Baltic Sea, so the seaport at the entrance of the river is of great importance to Poland's military strategy and economy. If another strong country were to gain a foothold in Danzig, it could, at will, block Poland's access to the Baltic Sea and inflict economic and military blows. All those responsible for formulating the current Free City regulations are well aware of this fact and have tried their best to stipulate the articles accordingly. There is no issue of oppressing the Germans in Danzig, and the administration of the Free City is now in the hands of the Germans. The only restrictions imposed are not a kind of exploitation of the freedom of citizens. The current solution, although not without room for improvement, cannot be considered fundamentally unfair or illogical in itself. In fact, the maintenance of the status quo of Danzig was personally guaranteed by the German leader and the late Polish General Piłsudski when they signed the ten-year agreement until 1944. Before March of this year, although Germany seemed to feel that the status of Danzig needed to be modified, it did not consider this issue to be urgent or about to cause a serious dispute. However, in March, the German government suddenly made a demand to Poland in the form of extortion and supplemented it with a propaganda campaign. The Polish government realized that it might encounter the danger of a unilateral solution and had to resist with all its strength. Poland witnessed that the current facts were no different from what happened in Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Memel, so it refused to accept the German proposal and put forward possible solutions to the issues that Germany was concerned about. The Polish government took some self-defense measures on March 23 and replied to Berlin on March 26. I ask the House to pay close attention to these dates. Germany is now widely rumored that the Polish government's actions I mentioned were caused by the guarantee given by the British government. It should be known that the British government's guarantee was only given to Poland as late as March 31. On March 26, this was not even mentioned to the Polish government. The recent incidents in Danzig have made people fear that the future status of Danzig will be resolved through unilateral actions organized by secret and improper means, and that Poland and other powers will be shown the accomplished fact. Therefore, any action taken by Poland in this situation to restore the overall situation can be called an act of aggression. If other powers support Poland's actions, they can be blamed for assisting and instigating Poland to use force. If the result of the incident is as imagined by such speculation, then the members of the House should understand that this dispute cannot be regarded as a purely local incident involving the rights and freedoms of the residents of Danzig. In fact, their rights and freedoms have not been threatened at all, and it will immediately cause a more serious dispute related to the survival and independence of the Polish state. We have given Poland a guarantee that if Poland's independence is clearly threatened and it believes it necessary to resist this threat with all its national strength, Britain is willing to come to its aid. We are determined to implement this guarantee. (10th Reuters dispatch)

Danzig The National Socialist newspapers here made a preemptive response to British Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech on Danzig before he even delivered it. One newspaper said that if Britain no longer encourages Poland to continue its anti-German propaganda, the Germans will pay attention to Chamberlain's remarks. (10th Reuters dispatch)

In addition, six more will be completed by the end of this year, and the remaining seven will be completed next year. (10th Havas dispatch)

### Danzig Nazi Leader Again Threatens Poland, Saying Danzig Must Return to Germany, Poland Should Not Establish an Arsenal, and Fresh German Troops Approach the Polish Border

Danzig Free City. The Nazi Party branch held a large meeting here this afternoon, where the leader, Forster, gave a speech, roughly stating that the Free City of Danzig has a Germanic character, even more so now than in the past. Once merged with Germany, the living conditions of the citizens will greatly improve. Even if living conditions worsen, no one would not long to be merged with Germany. Currently, the Polish government has built an arsenal in the Westerplatte area near the port of Danzig, which poses a permanent threat to the Free City of Danzig and the port. Since the city of Danzig cannot store weapons within its borders, Poland should not have this right either. (Havas, 9th)

Danzig. Nazi Party leader Forster gave a speech to the public here today. When he spoke of the good neighbor Poland in a sarcastic tone, the audience erupted in jeers and shouts of "Poles must disappear from Danzig." Forster claimed that the desire of the people of Danzig to return to Germany is stronger now than ever before. The Polish Corridor is a victim of the Versailles fraud, and Danzig will eventually return to Germany. However, Forster's speech today gave the impression that his words were slightly milder than half a month ago. When a Reuters reporter was recording his speech on the spot, a stormtrooper suddenly stepped forward to question him. The Reuters reporter replied that he represented a British newspaper. The soldier said, "British newspapers are lying newspapers. Be sure to tell the truth and do not make hate speech." (Reuters, 9th)

Warsaw. According to a special dispatch, fresh German troops have now arrived at the border between former Czechoslovakia and Poland, 200 yards from the border, and are setting up barbed wire with hooks, ranging from 20 to 40 yards deep. Polish newspapers today reported two incidents in Danzig: a Polish road worker was beaten by four uniformed Nazi Party members near Schichau Werft and was later rescued by another road worker. At the same time, twelve workers at the Schießstättenkai (where military supplies were recently landed) in Giesserei were detained in German detention camps. (Reuters, 9th)

Forster Warns Poland

Danzig. Nazi Party Danzig District Leader Forster delivered a speech in Oliva yesterday, discussing the relationship between Danzig and Poland, declaring that the people of Danzig have the right to demand that Danzig become a part of Germany and will demand to merge with Germany. The opinions of the few Poles in Danzig are not worth considering, because the status of the few Germans in Poland is not valued by Poland at all. The Polish diplomatic representative in Danzig acts like a High Commissioner in Danzig, which is ridiculous. The Poles in Danzig are fundamentally in a guest position, and their words have no weight. Forster then spoke at the Neufahrwasser port, demanding that Poland remove the Polish arsenal in Danzig, and claiming that Danzig's demand for return to Germany has the following three guarantees: (1) Hitler's spokesman Goebbels once said that 80 million Germans unanimously support the people of Danzig; (2) the German army is the most elite army in the world and also unanimously supports the people of Danzig; (3) the young and strong men of the Danzig Germanic race are all willing to bear arms to defend their homeland. (Haitong, 10th)

Danzig. Danzig Nazi Party leader Forster yesterday warned Poland against interfering in the affairs of the Free City, and demanded that Poland abandon the military warehouse it obtained in the port of Danzig according to the Treaty of Versailles. Amidst the cheers of 10,000 Nazi Party members, the Danzig Nazi Party leader declared that the Free City is not afraid of any attack, because Danzig has obtained the guarantee of protection from Chancellor Hitler. This guarantee was provided to the Danzig Nazi Party by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels during his recent visit to Danzig. Forster declared, "80 million Germans are behind us. The German army is the best army in the world. The people of Danzig can take up arms to defend themselves when necessary." (Associated Press, 10th)

Polish Border Tensions, German Provocations

Danzig. According to news received here today, a German in the Polish area of ​​Strohgrad, on the border, was shot dead by a Polish policeman when he tried to escape upon seeing the policeman approaching. The policeman has now been arrested. Someone also placed a large stone on the track in a sparsely populated area outside Kiefernwalde, intending to damage the express train traveling between Königsberg and Berlin. Fortunately, it was discovered by a railway policeman, and no disaster occurred. Poles call this a German act of provocation, while Germans say it is another Polish anti-German atrocity.

Polish Newspaper's Anti-German Tone Softens

(London) The Polish Ambassador to the UK, Raczynski, returned here last night from Warsaw and will meet with British Foreign Secretary Halifax today. Raczynski may have brought documents from Warsaw, but their contents are currently unknown. According to a dispatch from Warsaw, Polish newspapers are now placing news about Danzig in a crucial position and are also softening their previously strong anti-German tone, probably in view of the recent easing of the tense situation and with the intention of calming things down. (Reuters, 10th)

### German Newspaper on Danzig's Economy

(Berlin) The "Frankfurter Zeitung" recently published an article commenting on the economic development of the city of Danzig after its customs union with Poland in the past 20 years. The article roughly stated, "Since 1919, the economic development of the city of Danzig, according to our research, has made us deeply feel that the Polish government has not used the resources of the city of Danzig to benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood, and has obstructed the efforts of the citizens of Danzig to strive for prosperity. The Polish government has adopted this policy in order to make the city of Danzig economically controlled by Poland, and then politically and culturally suppress the city of Danzig. After the customs of the city of Danzig were merged with Poland, the Polish government used it to control the foreign affairs of the city of Danzig. Commercial agreements signed by Poland with foreign countries, except for those whose interests of the city of Danzig are indirectly the same as those of Poland, do not take into account the interests of the city of Danzig."

### International Agricultural Congress Opens in Hungary

### Italian Newspaper Proposes Axis Powers' Peace Terms, Italy Demands French Territories in Africa, Germany Demands Danzig and Former Colonies

(Rome) The Fascist Party's newspaper "Il Regime Fascista" recently published an article explaining the peace terms that the Berlin-Rome Axis can accept. The article roughly stated, "If the Danzig Free City issue can be resolved according to Germany's demands, the European war crisis can be swept away. To this day, if European countries are truly willing to seek appeasement, thereby limiting armaments, implementing economic cooperation, and laying the foundation for lasting and constructive peace, then the French territory of Tunisia in North Africa and the French port of Djibouti in East Africa should be transferred to Italy. The Suez Canal should be under Italian control. The original territories of Spain, such as the British port of Gibraltar, should also be returned to Spain. Only then can the Mediterranean become a free sea, and we can guarantee Britain's right to free navigation in the Mediterranean. Furthermore, Germany's demands regarding the recovery of the Free City of Danzig and its former colonies must also be implemented. Since the Entente powers of Britain and France have forced Germany and Italy to compete in armaments by implementing power politics, if Germany and Italy are to restore their usual economic structure, they must be financially assisted and agreements must be concluded with them so that they can obtain various necessary raw materials without having to use their gold reserves. This is what fairness dictates. In addition, all actions that contain provocative implications for the totalitarian states, as well as the abuse of German and Italian expatriates, must be stopped. As for the Jewish issue, it should be resolved jointly by all countries by relocating the Jews outside of Europe (excluding the Pakistan region). If Britain and France still have doubts about the German-Italian Axis regarding all these measures and whether we can live in peace with each other, then we can answer that Prime Minister Mussolini wants to seek peace in justice. We only need to obtain justice, and we are willing to guarantee the peace of Britain and France. However, as things stand, we do not initially expect that our proposals will be accepted by the other party. Therefore, how the situation will develop is beyond our prediction. In our opinion, the Entente powers will obtain peace at a higher price, and perhaps only after paying an extremely high price." (Havas, 10th)

(London) The British sex psychologist Havelock Ellis passed away at his home in Hintlesham near Ipswich today at the age of 80. Havelock Ellis was born on February 1, 1859, in Croydon, Surrey. His father was a cargo ship captain. Ellis sailed with his father in his childhood and had traveled around the world by the age of eight. He then became deeply interested in medicine. After completing his studies, he served at St Thomas' Hospital here. When his first work on sex psychology was published, it was severely criticized by the people of the country, so it was published in the United States instead. His book "Studies in the Psychology of Sex" was prosecuted by the London court in 1898 for obscenity. As of today, he is generally recognized as a master of sex psychology. (Havas, 10th)

### Unexpected Incident Occurs on the Hai River in Tianjin, Japanese Soldiers Open Fire as a Tugboat Passes By, Wounding Three People

(Tianjin) At 2:00 PM today, an unexpected incident occurred on the Hai River in the British sector, resulting in three people being injured and admitted to the hospital. The incident involved the tugboat "Saxon" of the Dagu Tug and Lighter Company. As the tugboat was towing a cargo ship upstream, a Chinese sampan attempted to hook onto the cargo ship to ride along. A Japanese soldier from the former German Concession on the opposite bank suddenly opened fire, hitting the head of the helmsman of the tugboat. A Chinese sailor from the "Saxon" was also shot in the arm. The Japanese soldier then shot the owner of the sampan, and the bullet entered his chest. The three boats quickly sailed to the British Concession riverside to moor. The three injured were rushed to the Victoria Hospital. It is reported that the helmsman's injuries are serious. The British police are investigating the incident. The British Consul General Jameson has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese authorities regarding this matter. It was found that the bullets were aimed at the British Concession riverside, but it is strange that no one in the Concession was injured by stray bullets, as there are often many Chinese and some foreigners on the riverside to escape the heat, and a little further away is Victoria Road, the main road in Tianjin, with tall buildings along the road, which are the locations of offices. (Reuters, 10th)

(Tianjin) Today, along the Bai River in the former Russian Concession, a Japanese patrolman shot at a sampan man who fled into a British Dagu barge, causing the boatman to be injured in the chest and hand. At the same time, a Chinese sailor on the barge was also shot twice, once in the head and once in the hand. Another sailor was injured in the leg. The British Consul, after studying the case tonight, has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese side, believing that the Japanese soldiers' shooting at British ships was purely intentional. Moreover, the width of the Bai River is only about 100 yards here. If bullets are fired indiscriminately from the opposite bank, they will inevitably fall into the British Concession.

### British and French Army, Navy, and Air Force Generals Gather in Singapore for Joint Defense Talks; Important Decisions Made Regarding Countermeasures in the Far East; Official Statement Only States All Agreements Reached Were Consistent; US and Netherlands Closely Monitoring the Conference

Singapore Correspondence: The British-French Far East Joint Defense Conference, convened to protect interests in the Far East, although international relations prevented the United States and the Netherlands from formally sending representatives, in reality, both countries are taking the same steps as Britain and France. Therefore, this conference can be considered a British-French Far East Defense Joint Conference, and it can also be considered a Democratic Nations' Far East Joint Defense Conference.

The conference began on June 23rd in Singapore. It was announced beforehand that 60 representatives would participate, including important British and French Far East army, navy, and air force generals. However, only 44 officially attended the conference. It is believed that the remaining dozen or so were staff secretaries, etc. The conference was originally scheduled for a week, but it actually ended after only five days. The reasons for shortening the conference time were due to: (1) the French General Staff and its delegation's thorough preparation; (2) preparatory meetings held before the main conference to ensure smooth and rapid progress. However, the strict blockade of the British concession in Tianjin and the Japanese army's occupation of Shantou during the conference posed a greater threat to British and French interests, making the situation even more tense and necessitating early preparation, which was also a major reason for the early conclusion of the conference.

This conference was purely confidential, held in the gymnasium of an army camp, guarded by soldiers, and no one other than representatives could enter. However, because of its special importance, not only Japan and Germany paid attention, but people all over the world were watching. Therefore, English newspaper reporters still tried to gather information in various ways. The chairman of the conference was Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Fleet. His effective command and ability to handle matters gave a good impression to the representatives, who admired his superb military knowledge and unique grasp of special Far East issues, which further impressed the representatives. From the morning of the 22nd until the announcement of its conclusion on the 26th, during these five days, plenary sessions were held every morning, and in the afternoon, three subcommittees of the navy, army, and air force were conducted until 6 pm. Meetings were also held for several hours on Sundays. The tense situation can be easily imagined.

The news of the Japanese army's occupation of Shantou, conveyed to the generals in the meeting by Reuters reporters, aroused great attention. It was widely believed that there would be important discussions and decisions on how Britain and France should deal with the rampant behavior of the Japanese army in China. How to prevent Japan from advancing southward was also hotly debated on the third day of the conference. It was believed that the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island and the Spratly Islands, and the establishment of fishing grounds or other bases in the western islands of Malaya should not be ignored. Finally, important decisions were made, especially regarding the protection of the oil fields in North Borneo.

The attitude of Siam was also given the utmost attention in the conference. Siam, located between Malaya, Burma, and Annam, holds the key to the decisive battle in the Far East, so it is naturally impossible not to pay attention to it. During the conference, Mr. Bischoff, Air Defense Advisor to the Burmese government, reported on Siam's true attitude. Bischoff also served as Siam's Air Force Counsellor and was more familiar with the situation. Siam's traditional friendly relations with Britain have not been shaken to this day. Although the Japanese side has tried hard to persuade Siam to join the Fascist camp, in fact, Siam is still regarded as the Belgium of Europe, and it is generally expected that Siam will inevitably stand on the side of Britain and France during the war.

In summary, according to information from relevant parties, the conference made the following eight important resolutions: (1) the issue of unified command of the British and French armies in the Far East, with the Commander-in-Chief being Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Fleet, and the headquarters located in Singapore; (2) the merger of British and French armaments and resources in wartime; (3) drafting a combat plan and first studying the strengths of the Japanese navy in order to cope with it when war breaks out; (4) actively rebuilding the Cam Ranh Bay naval base in Annam into a "Singapore of France" military port with the joint efforts of Britain and France; (5) protecting British and French concessions in China; (6) protecting British and French merchant ships in the Far East; (7) protecting transportation lines in the Far East; (8) the mutual relations between Britain and France, Siam, the United States, and the Dutch East Indies. When a reporter asked Brigadier General Binden, Director of the local Defense Intelligence Office, about the above eight items, he could not agree to be responsible for confirming them.

However, at the close of the conference, a notice was issued, stating that the conference concluded on the 26th. After the closing, Mr. Noble immediately took his flagship back to the waters off North China. All reports in the newspapers about the conference were nothing more than speculation and were not officially provided by responsible authorities. However, all agreements reached at this conference regarding countermeasures for all issues were consistent. This public announcement is boilerplate, but it is included here for readers' reference.

Regarding the relationship between the conference and the United States and the Netherlands, the public part was to notify the authorities of the two countries of the results of the conference at any time. According to telegrams obtained by local English newspapers, American newspapers covered this conference with great fanfare. The Manila Bulletin, founded by the United States in the Philippines, even published an editorial on the opening day of the conference offering its opinions. In the Dutch East Indies, a Dutch newspaper in Batavia specially sent a reporter to Singapore to report on the conference news. People in Batavia also advocated selecting important officials to liaise with the conference. There was also a rumor that important Dutch generals took advantage of their holidays to go to Singapore to meet with the generals and discuss defense issues. In fact, the close relationship between the Netherlands and the United States and the conference can be seen in the phrase "the conference resolutions were notified to the United States and the Netherlands."

Admiral Noble was originally scheduled to leave Singapore on the 26th, but finally departed on the morning of the 27th. The reason: waiting to meet with the Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Navy, who was going to Britain to report to the Admiralty on Pacific defense work. Both Chinese and English newspapers in Singapore predicted that Britain's flexible attitude towards Japan would be proven after Noble arrived in the China Sea. (Yi Sheng) A special dispatch from Shantou: Senior British and French army, navy, and air force officers stationed in the Far East held a meeting in the Singapore naval port to deal with the Far East crisis. The location of the meeting was absolutely kept secret beforehand and was held at the headquarters on Canning Hill in Singapore. Rumors that it was held on the HMS Kent or in the Tanglin Barracks were just speculation. When the meeting opened at noon on the 22nd, Reuters news about the Japanese army's occupation of Shantou and the Japanese army's deadline for British and American ships to withdraw from Shantou by 1:00 pm had been delivered to the conference table. The representatives attached great importance to it. In view of the serious situation on the Chinese coast, they discussed the Japanese navy's blockade of the mainland and countermeasures. A battalion of the army was dispatched near the meeting place, with strict precautions. The conference did not come to a successful conclusion until the 26th. Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Fleet, and General Garnett, Commander-in-Chief of the Army in China, left Singapore on the HMS Kent on the 27th and arrived in Hong Kong at 10:00 am on July 1st. Because the resolutions of the conference were of great significance, the news was specially recorded from a certain source.

The British-French Far East Military Joint Defense Conference was guarded by more than a battalion of armed forces, and the situation was extremely serious and tense. The preliminary procedures of the conference have been completed, and it has been decided in principle that the two countries, Britain and France, will carry out military cooperation in the Far East. It is claimed that this conference will not involve the political issues of other countries. The authorities have made an official announcement stating that the procedures for this conference are as follows: (1) the issue of the supreme commander in the event of war between Britain and France in the Far East. It has been decided that the supreme commander will be Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Fleet; (2) the issue of cooperation between the military forces of Britain and France in the Far East; (3) mutual assistance and protection of each other's territorial waters and airspace by the navy and air force; (4) mutual use of airfields and military ports; (5) joint protection of the commercial transportation of the two countries in the Far East. This conference is indeed closely related to the United States, the Netherlands, and Australia in the Far East and the Pacific. Although no formal representatives have been sent to participate, the progress of the conference is reported to the authorities of those countries in an informal manner. The main topic of the conference is the allocation of the subcommittees and their personnel, but in principle, absolute military cooperation between Britain and France in the Far East has been achieved. However, the content of the conference is absolutely kept secret by the authorities. Under the protection of a large armed force, no one is allowed to approach the conference site, so outsiders know very little about it. It is also said that the greatest task of this conference is to maximize the effectiveness of Britain and France in the Far East when a war breaks out with an enemy country. At a minimum, the following plans must be completed: (1) to deal with Japan's unilateral oppression of the Far Eastern powers during the troubled times in Europe; (2) to consider the possible forms of war that will inevitably be triggered in the Far East when the European war breaks out.

Based on this conference, it is necessary to consider how to utilize the manpower and resources of various places, supplemented by modern military equipment, to enhance the self-defense capabilities of the countries and reduce Europe's worries about the East.

### Japanese Troops Withdraw from Changxing; Fighting Continues in Jiapu

Changxing Correspondence: After the Japanese troops captured Changxing, they immediately occupied the Changyi Coal Mine. Last month, Changyi was recovered by the Chinese army. The coal that was mined could not be exported by the Japanese troops. On the afternoon of July 9th, 130 Japanese troops from Jiapu Town (under the jurisdiction of Wuxing County) on the west bank of Taihu Lake, boarded large and small motorboats and sneaked into Changjing in an attempt to rob and transport the accumulated coal blocks. However, they were discovered early by the Chinese army in Changxing, which immediately sent troops to ambush them at Longtou Mountain. One motorboat was sunk on the spot, and three were damaged. About 40 Japanese troops were killed or wounded. The Chinese army tracked and pursued them to Jiapu, captured and executed the bandit leader Xu Fenwen and others, and the remaining bandits fled in all directions. List of 21 County Puppet Governors

### Qualifications, Appointments, and Treatment of Higher Education Faculty Nationwide (Part 2)

More Concrete Qualification Standards After the Establishment of the National Government

(3) The Era of the National Government

The former Educational Administration Committee promulgated the Regulations on the Qualifications of University Faculty in June of the 16th year of the Republic of China, dividing university faculty into four grades: first grade, professor; second grade, associate professor; third grade, lecturer; and fourth grade, teaching assistant. Those with one of the following qualifications may serve as teaching assistants: (1) Graduates of domestic or foreign universities with a bachelor's degree and considerable achievements; (2) Those who have made achievements in Chinese studies. Those with one of the following qualifications may serve as lecturers: (a) Graduates of domestic or foreign universities with a master's degree and considerable achievements; (b) Teaching assistants who have completed more than one year of teaching and have made special achievements; (3) Those who have made contributions in Chinese studies. Those with one of the following qualifications may serve as associate professors: (a) Those who have studied in foreign university graduate schools for several years and have obtained a doctoral degree with considerable achievements; (b) Lecturers who have completed more than one year of teaching and have made special achievements; (4) Those who have made special contributions in Chinese studies. Those who have served as associate professors for more than two years of teaching and have made special achievements may serve as professors. The organization that reviews the qualifications of faculty members is the university's council. During the review, a representative from the central educational administrative agency attends as a nonvoting member. Qualified faculty members are recognized by the central educational administrative agency and given certificates. This is the beginning of the qualification review that university faculty members should undergo, and it is also the characteristic of this regulation. However, in fact, universities did not establish councils, and the qualification review of university faculty members was not implemented. The appointment of university faculty members is based on the provisions of the University Organization Law. The deans are appointed by the president, and the department heads and professors, associate professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants of each department are appointed by the president after consultation with the deans. In addition to the salary scales for university faculty members announced by the former Educational Administration Committee in the 16th year of the Republic of China, there are no detailed regulations on the treatment of university faculty members. As for the faculty members of specialized schools, they are divided into full-time and part-time, according to the Organization Law of Specialized Schools, and are appointed by the principal. There are no explicit regulations on qualifications and treatment.

The above is the evolution of the regulations on the qualifications, appointment, and treatment of faculty members in schools above the specialized level. Let's try to analyze it. Each period has its own characteristics. In the early days of schools in the late Qing Dynasty, the various regulations for faculty members were only general provisions in principle. This was necessary in fact because the school system was newly established. Its characteristic was that faculty members were all listed as officials, such as supervisors, directors, supervising officials, and inspectors. Officials were appointed by the government, so there were no explicit regulations on how to review and select faculty qualifications or how to appoint them, which implicitly meant that they were controlled by the government. During the period of the Beijing government, the names of university faculty members were initially divided into two types: professors and teaching professors, and then into four types: full professors, professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants, which was more detailed than in the late Qing Dynasty. However, except for private universities and specialized schools, the standards for faculty qualifications were not strictly defined, and the methods for qualification review were not specified in detail. Other aspects such as faculty appointment, treatment, and service were all subject to established regulations and detailed planning. The regulations stipulated that the number of faculty members in each school must first be approved by the Ministry of Education, the president should be recommended by the school to the Ministry for appointment, full-time faculty members should be employed by the school and reported to the Ministry for approval, and part-time faculty members should be employed by the school and reported to the Ministry for record. The regulations were quite strict. After the sixth year of the Republic of China, the appointment of faculty members in national universities was not as strict as before, but the regulations on treatment, tenure, further studies, retirement, and pensions were more detailed. During the period of the Beijing government, the various regulations for faculty members in schools above the specialized level gradually became more detailed, but attention was not yet paid to the review of qualifications. After the establishment of the National Government, the standards for the qualifications of university faculty members were more concrete, and it was stipulated that they must undergo qualification review. The review organization was responsible to the university council, but it was not actually implemented. The method of appointment was still by the president, but it was necessary to consult with the deans, and the treatment was only generally determined in terms of amount, without division into grades. Other aspects such as security and further studies were not subject to established regulations. Except for the slight regulations in the Organization Law of Specialized Schools, no detailed regulations have been established for the faculty members of specialized schools. In view of this, the Ministry of Education has been thinking about revising a reasonable and practical set of regulations for the various regulations for faculty members of universities and specialized schools in recent years, in order to implement them. The issue of faculty members is deeply and greatly related to the essence of university and specialized education, and it is necessary to establish a good standard and uniform regulations in order to improve the essence and raise the level. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be done hastily. If the regulations are too idealistic, they will be difficult to implement. If they are too broad, they will not help in practice. It is necessary to refer to past systems, refer to the established laws of various countries, and carefully stipulate the actual situation of each school, so that practical results can be achieved. It is said that the Ministry of Education is paying attention to research in order to make improvements. (End)

### Guangxi's Annual Adult Education Implementation Measures; Adult Education Must Be Popularized Within This Year

(Guilin Correspondence) Guangxi has designated the 28th year as the Year of Adult Education, which was reported in previous newspapers. The implementation measures are recorded below:

Administrative Organization It is stipulated that the 28th year is the Year of Adult Education in Guangxi Province. Political power will be used to mobilize intellectuals to thoroughly popularize adult education within this year. The province has established an Adult Education Year Promotion Committee, and each county has also established a committee to promote the implementation of various undertakings.

Enrollment and Compilation It is stipulated that illiterate adults of both sexes aged 18 to 45 and those who cannot yet read and understand the texts of the first two books of the People's School textbooks should all enroll in school. The county government and the village and street offices of each township are responsible for the investigation. If there are absences, they will be punished in accordance with the provincial order. An absence of three days will result in a fine of five jiao in national currency or one day of labor. This will be applied by analogy for absences exceeding three days. For absences of more than one month, in addition to the fine or labor, they will be ordered to repeat the course. Those who should enroll in school but do not enroll after persuasion, or who are absent from school without reason after enrolling, and do not comply with paying the fine or performing labor service, may be detained by the county government as a warning. However, the detention period shall not exceed three days at most.

The province is divided into four periods to complete adult education, so illiterate adults also enroll in school in four periods. (1) Enroll in school in periods by drawing lots. (2) Illiterate adults who are family members of village, township, and street chiefs and other civil servants must enroll in school in the first period. (3) Those who voluntarily enroll in advance should be given priority. (4) If there are two or more adults in a family who should enroll in school and are drawn in the same period, they can enroll in periods. As for the compilation of adult classes, each class should have a minimum of 25 students and a maximum of 50 students, and classes should be divided by gender in principle.

Curriculum and Teaching Materials The weekly curriculum for adult classes is based on the regulations of the Guangxi Provincial Government and includes the following items: (1) Anti-Japanese speeches (including memorial weeks) for two hours; (2) National language for nine hours; (3) Current affairs reports for one hour; (4) Anti-Japanese songs for one and a half hours; (5) Assembly activities for half an hour.

Teacher Training Teacher sources: (1) Transferring directors of the guidance departments of central basic schools; (2) Transferring teachers from basic schools at all levels; (3) Transferring surplus teachers after the adjustment of each county in accordance with the province's wartime basic education implementation measures; (4) If there are not enough teachers, civil servants and intellectuals may be conscripted to supplement them. Before the implementation of adult education, all teachers will be given special training to meet the needs of the times. As for teacher treatment, each adult class will receive a subsidy of five yuan after it is completed. However, teachers of adult classes organized by various groups will not receive subsidies. Teachers of adult classes are exempt from the obligation to perform military service or corvée during their service period.

Estimated Expenses The province will eliminate illiteracy throughout the province in four periods within one year. The estimated expenses for this year are as follows: (1) The total number of illiterate people is 1,863,995. Based on 40 people per class, 46,600 classes should be organized. These will be organized in four periods, with 11,700 classes in each period. (2) The total number of teachers required is 5,850. Each teacher teaches two classes per period. 2,291 directors of the guidance departments of central basic schools and 3,559 teachers from basic schools and surplus teachers will be transferred. (3) The allocation of expenses includes adult class office expenses, teacher subsidies, teacher living expenses, provincial supervisor travel expenses, and contingency funds, totaling 931,100 yuan. The average cost per class is 20 yuan, and the average cost per student is 5 jiao. The living expenses for each teacher are 10 yuan per month.

### Number of Primary and Secondary School Students in Concession Areas Increases Sharply After the War; Total of More Than 140,000 People

Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the population in the two concession areas has suddenly increased sharply. Most of the students in the war zones of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have fled to Shanghai with them, resulting in a mushrooming increase in the number of schools established in the concession areas, and the education industry has become a deformed development. However, it is difficult to accurately investigate the number of students. According to investigators, the number of high school and primary school students has indeed increased sharply since the war, reaching more than 50,000 people. There are now more than 140,000 high school and primary school students in public and private schools in the city, and more than 40,000 students in schools affiliated with the Municipal Council's Education Department.

### Finance: Foreign Exchange Remains Stable; Gold Market Not as Buoyant as Expected

Goods Imported by the Tianjin Banking Community Last Weekend: All Re-emerge; Market Price, If Based on Off-Exchange Gray Market: Drops Ten Yuan

Yesterday's cash scarlet gray market situation: The opening momentum was not as strong as on the previous holiday, as the general operators' expectations from last weekend failed to materialize. This was because the British and American exchange markets were extremely stable today, causing buyers to hesitate and mostly wait and see. Therefore, the morning opening dropped to 2,580 yuan. Although the Hong Kong banking community still showed interest and wealthy merchants from the wood market frequently absorbed, a certain money exchange firm released all the goods it had imported last weekend, and securities firms also sold more than they bought. Therefore, the balance of supply and demand remained stable, with little change, hovering between 2,580 and 2,590 yuan. As a result, it increased by eight yuan compared to last Saturday's noon closing, but it actually fell by more than ten yuan compared to the previous day's off-exchange gray market. Trading was brisk in the morning, around 600 taels, but it suddenly cleared up in the afternoon, with only a few dozen taels. Jewelers raised the price of jewelry gold by two yuan. The prices of Customs Gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Scarlet Only Increases by Eight Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels), the opening momentum was weak and not as firm as on the previous holiday. This was because after noon last weekend, there were sudden rumors of a major contraction in the Tianjin foreign exchange market, so some operators expected that the Shanghai foreign exchange market might be slightly affected on Monday. However, because the potential of the British and American exchange markets was extremely stable today, people's hearts turned tired, and buyers waited and watched, causing the price to drop from 2,590 yuan to 80 yuan before a transaction was seen. First, the cash firm gave its jeweler 50 taels, priced at 2,580 yuan, which was 20 yuan lower than the previous day's off-exchange gray market, but 3 yuan higher than last Saturday's noon closing. After the opening, the Hong Kong banking community showed excellent interest, and securities firms also showed buying intentions. Therefore, although a certain money exchange firm was selling, the position still felt that demand exceeded supply, and the market momentum rose upward. In a flash, it rose by five yuan. The jewelers bought 50 taels from a certain money exchange firm, priced at 85 yuan, and then rose by another yuan. A certain gold firm (acting on behalf of the Hong Kong banking community) bought 50 taels from a certain money exchange firm, priced at 86 yuan. Later, it rose by another four yuan. The securities firm bought 50 taels from the jewelers, priced at 90 yuan. Then, a certain gold firm (on behalf of the Hong Kong banking community) and a money exchange firm successively absorbed, with the money exchange firm totaling 100 taels, all at the same price. At that time, the buying momentum gradually weakened, and the market turned tired. The jewelers sold 20 taels to the securities firm, priced at 88 yuan. Before long, the securities firm immediately sold 20 taels back to the cash firm, priced at 87 yuan. Later, the securities firm forcefully sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange firm (on behalf of a wealthy merchant in this city), priced at only 82 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange firm still strongly absorbed on behalf of the wealthy, and the situation tended to stabilize. A certain money exchange firm bought 50 taels from a fellow firm, priced at 85 yuan, and then bought 30 taels each from the securities firm and a certain silver house, both priced at 84 yuan. Later, a certain silver house again absorbed 50 taels from the securities firm on behalf of the Hong Kong banking community, priced at 86 yuan. At noon, a certain money exchange firm again absorbed 50 taels from a gold firm on behalf of a wealthy merchant, priced at 85 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the transaction was extremely clear, and the market situation was also flat. Only the jewelers sold 10 taels to a gold firm and 20 taels to a money exchange firm, priced at 2,585 yuan, which was the evening closing price. As a result, it increased by eight yuan compared to last weekend, but it was more than ten yuan lower than the previous day's off-exchange gray market. The entire day fluctuated by ten yuan. The cash firm's own gold was priced ten yuan higher than the scarlet price. The current standard gold was priced about fifty yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, there were few transactions.

Jewelry Gold is Listed One Yuan Higher

The selling price of jewelry gold per tael was initially unchanged, but at noon it was listed one yuan higher. There were no changes after that. The Datonghang revised its listing to 262 yuan, the Xintonghang to 260 yuan, and the buying price to 254 yuan. The Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash remained at 1,212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed price for Customs Gold remained at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also remained stable at 1,207 yuan and 6 jiao, which was due to the London telegram of the 8th, stating that British pure gold was still at £7, 8 shillings, 6 pence, and 10.

### Japanese Notes Rise Significantly

Last Saturday, British pure gold and the British-American exchange rate remained unchanged. Yesterday, the foreign exchange in this city saw brisk settlements from foreign firms. Foreign banks provided ample supply, and the market was stable and uneventful. Scarlet opened weakly, making a low of 2,580 yuan, down 14 yuan from last Saturday's gray market. After entering, jewelers and gold firms showed strong buying intentions, rising to 90 yuan. The noon closing was 85 yuan. In the afternoon, trading was sparse and the market price did not change, up 8 yuan from Saturday. Foreign currencies, British and American gold pounds, were in scarce demand. The price of gold rose overtly but fell covertly. The British gold pound fell back, and British and American gold notes traded briskly. Because the market price had risen too much on Saturday, today's exchange rate was stable as before, and all fell back. Annam and Robbie notes were in demand, rising very slightly. Philippine and German gold notes were suddenly in high demand, and the market price was firm. Japanese gold notes were in good demand, with the market price at 9 jiao, 9 fen, and 7 li. Notes with a face value of 50 yuan, so-called large notes, were in even greater demand, with the market price at 1 yuan and 6 fen, up more than 3 fen from last Saturday. Public Association trading was not brisk. Hongchang sold Taixin British gold notes for £30, and Hengmao sold Taixin British gold notes for £40. Yesterday's market price saw British gold pounds and British gold notes each falling by 5 fen, American gold notes falling by 2 fen and 8 li, Hong Kong notes falling by 3 li, Annam and Robbie notes each rising by 1 fen, Philippine notes rising by 5 fen, and German gold notes rising by 7 fen. Other currencies remained unchanged.

### Long Positions Already Closing Out; July Futures Foreign Exchange Eases

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listings remain unchanged. The off-market British and American exchange rates were also very stable. Although there were still many settlements from foreign firms and the Japanese bank also started to absorb shillings, HSBC and other foreign banks were still willing to supply continuously, so there was no change as a result. However, because many long positions in July futures were closing out after HSBC restricted swap transactions, although other foreign banks still traded, they mostly posted out, so they were only closing out. Speculators and Chinese banks were no longer enthusiastically arbitraging, and foreign banks' appetite was also sluggish due to the imminent delivery, so the potential market situation showed weakness again. The August market situation was very flat. As a result, the British slightly lengthened and the Americans remained flat. However, today it was heard that American banks such as Chase National had posted American dollars 375 to Chinese merchants for July-August swaps, and the combined monthly interest rate was still about 3 fen. If speculators were willing to post out, they would not do so without a monthly interest rate of 3 fen, 8 li, or 9 li. It was still difficult to swap large amounts, and generally, operators were watching for interest rates to continue to rise. Trading was brisk in the morning, but suddenly cleared up in the afternoon. Because foreign firms were strongly absorbing, the Hong Kong exchange rate softened slightly.

The Japanese Bank is Still Closing Out

Early in the morning, the recent London big bill shortened by half a penny, the long-term fell by 375, the New York silver price remained unchanged, and the London raw gold also had no ups and downs. The exchange rate of the British against the American was slightly 3 hao, and against Shanghai and France it was flat. The American against the British, Shanghai, and France also had no change. The Central listing exchange rates were as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling price saw British gold at 6 pence, 5,625, and American exchange at 12 yuan, 7,8125, both of which had no change from last weekend. After the opening, although there were still many settlements from foreign firms and the Japanese bank also started to absorb large amounts of shillings, the supply from HSBC and other foreign banks was still strong, so there was no change. It was calculated that the Japanese Bank, Zhengjin, Sanling, and foreign firms successively bought spot British gold from HSBC and Bank of China at 6 pence, 5,625. Then the foreign firm settled and bought spot American exchange from American banks at 12 yuan, 7,8125. When HSBC's listing was announced, there were no changes. When the silver balance tax was announced, it was still exempt. After that, the Chinese bank came to close out July's American exchange, but because the foreign banks' appetite was sluggish, the market situation gradually eased. It was calculated that the Chinese bank sold this month's American exchange from 12 yuan, 5625, to the Hua Bilu Holland Bank, which gradually hardened to 625. At times, there was some swap trading, with the American Bank Chase National selling out July and swapping into August, calculating a posting of American dollars 375 to Chinese merchants for arbitrage, combining for a monthly interest rate that was still about 3 fen. Near noon, a certain bank and fellow firms mutually traded August's American exchange, for 12 yuan, 1875, the situation also slightly hardened. Later, a foreign firm started to absorb spot Hong Kong exchange at a price of only 44 yuan, 25, the situation was slightly soft. Until the noon closing, the bank's spot selling price of British and American exchange was about the same as the morning opening.

Spot Market Situation Unchanged

Later market trading was sluggish. It was only heard that Bank of China absorbed July's American exchange from Bombay Silver Company at 12 yuan, 625, and the market situation was also flat. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, the foreign firms' selling price was still 44 yuan, 25, but there were no transactions heard. Extending to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price saw British gold at 6 pence, 5,625, American exchange at 12 yuan, 7,8125, July's British gold at 6 pence, 46,875, American exchange at 12 yuan, 59,375, August's British gold at 6 pence, 21,875, and American exchange at 12 yuan, 125. As a result, the spot prices of British and American exchange were all unchanged. July's British lengthened by 0625, American hardened by 09375, August's British loosened by 03125, and the American had no ups and downs. The Hong Kong exchange rate was tight at 125 when checked against the final selling price.

### Fractional Currency Substitutes

Since the disappearance of copper subsidiary coins in this city, all industries have felt quite inconvenienced with respect to small change. Those who toil the hardest are the worst off. This newspaper gave a detailed editorial account of this matter some days ago. It is hoped that the Central Bank, which is responsible for regulating finance, will expedite the printing and transportation to Shanghai of the new one-cent and five-cent subsidiary currency notes being printed in Hong Kong, so that they can be circulated in the market as soon as possible to facilitate the turnover of various industries. During the severe shortage of copper coin subsidiary currency in this city, in addition to using stamps and stamp tax tickets as substitutes, some companies and businesses used white paper to write fractions and stamped a seal on them as vouchers. Some, such as the trolley companies of the two concessions, Sincere Company, and The Sun Company, printed vouchers as small change. The Shanghai Municipal Council Public Omnibus Company originally had five-cent (now used as four cents, white) and two-and-a-half-cent (yellow, now used as two cents) vouchers, and recently also made a type of coin with the shape of a public omnibus on it, also for two cents. However, all of these can only be used in their own industries and cannot be circulated. Now, a printing plate is made above, which can also be used as historical data on currency in the future.

### Bank Reserve Committee Revises Interbank Loan Rate

The Shanghai Banking Association Reserve Committee revised the interbank loan rate, which has been implemented since yesterday (the 10th). The interest rate for borrowing interbank remittances is 2 jiao and 3 fen, and the interest rate for depositing interbank remittances is 1 jiao and 8 fen.

(Calculated per thousand yuan per day)

### Discount Rate Increases by Another Three Yuan

Yesterday, the discount rate for remittance bills suddenly rose again, from 90 yuan to 93 yuan per thousand yuan in the morning, and remained unchanged in the afternoon, three yuan higher than Saturday. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was seen to fall back by two cents, with both the morning and afternoon markets listing 1 jiao and 8 fen.

### Securities: No Definite News on Principal and Interest; Public Bonds Fluctuate

The securities gray market situation yesterday gradually saw virtual softness. Many long positions in No. 20 and Xingyuan slightly emerged, and even retail investors and Lianhe, etc., also turned long to short, which shows that people's hearts have not calmed down after the shock of the upper decision. At present, the important key is whether the seventh decision on principal and interest has been settled. Market rumors abound, with each person having a different opinion. Market rumors can be divided into two types: either that the principal will be stopped and the interest will be paid, but the interest must also be used as collateral; or that the principal and interest will be used as collateral, but only for the banking sector. It is simple and unclear, and there is no reality to delve into the bottom. Therefore, people's hearts are not as strong as they were a few days ago. The long positions are optimistic about Class C, but only seeing 50 yuan, and temporarily seeing 48 yuan for the small face. The short positions are worried about holding goods. Compared to the news in peoples' hearts, the bond market is not easy to see as good. Yesterday, Class A broke through the 60 yuan mark. Class B secretly broke through the 50 yuan mark again after the market closed. It may not be easy to establish this trend for a while. Yesterday, at the opening, No. 4 and Dafengtongkang, etc., were sold in, while the sellers were Tongshun, Xingyuan, Lianhe, plus No. 20 and No. 49 covering the selling momentum. The multiple forces were limited, and the market price gradually decreased. Class A first broke through 60 yuan, and Class B could not stand firm, and successively broke into the 50 yuan mark after the market closed. As a result, they all turned back a small three-corner half to nine-corner, secretly small. At about one o'clock in the afternoon, Class C had approached 48 yuan. The total number of transactions was counted as 600,000 yuan. The list is shown below.

Stock Market Situation: The share price of the Family Industrial Co., Ltd. was 40 yuan, and 30 shares were transacted. In the public stock exchange of the public enterprises, after the sparse delivery was completed, the afternoon market atmosphere turned better, and there was a slight demand for various stocks. The Jardine share was calm and stable, at 18 yuan, 8 jiao, totaling 2,000 shares. The Telephone share rose to 12 yuan, with 700 shares transacted. The Wheelock share rose sharply to 35 yuan. The Rubber share has been sluggish for several days, and is now slightly firm. The Anderson, Meyer & Co., Ltd share traded at 18 yuan, 3 jiao, and the Taikoo Dockyard & Engineering Company of Hong Kong share price was 2 yuan, 7 fen, and 5 li (ex-dividend).

### Cotton Yarn: Speculators and Actual Sales Rise Together, Cotton Yarn Soars

The yarn market has shifted towards soaring prices. This is largely because the Hong Kong contingent continues to relentlessly demand both coarse and fine yarns. Simultaneously, gold has risen slightly, and public sentiment has returned to expect further increases. Consequently, transactions among fellow merchants have become active again. It is reported that the recent market turnover has exceeded the actual volume of business by more than 50%. According to market sources, the general consensus among wealthy individuals is that their faith in legal tender has diminished, and they consider hoarding goods to be a more secure option. Therefore, the once-stagnant transactions among fellow merchants have seen a resurgence in the past two days. However, the poor performance and downward trend of other yarns will inevitably create opportunities for artificial fibers. Furthermore, gold prices remain in a state of fluctuation.

Regarding the current yarn situation, at the beginning of the morning session, some gold-backed speculators took a bullish stance, claiming that gold prices had rebounded after being absorbed by Tianjin speculators over the weekend and that prices were about to rise. However, the opening was still flat, with a price of 477 yuan per bale for 20-count Double Horse brand yarn from the warehouse. Ten bales were traded among fellow merchants, with the current selling price being 482 yuan. Soon after, a major player rallied and started buying in the market, pushing up the market price. At the same time, the Guangzhou brokers saw a slight increase in actual sales. By the closing price, 20-count Double Horse brand yarn from outside the warehouse was priced at 487.5 yuan, while warehouse-based yarn was priced at 482 yuan. According to the half-day turnover statistics, 1,390 bales were traded, with transactions among fellow merchants accounting for 700 bales. Prices for 10-count Double Horse brand yarn rose by 7 yuan, Shepherd brand by 9 yuan, and other yarns remained unchanged, with little difference from the previous day. Yesterday, 100 bales of cotton yarn arrived from Tianjin, while today, 55 bales were shipped to Siam, 377 bales to Hong Kong, and 180 bales to Tianjin. The quantities purchased by various trade groups are listed below:

The Japanese yarn market initially rose but then weakened, ultimately falling by 2 yuan. The reasons for this were: firstly, a shortage of legal tender and tight credit conditions; and secondly, sluggish sales and poor market conditions. The current asking price for 20-count Moon Lute brand yarn is between 386 and 387 yuan.

### Banks Refuse to Provide Loans, Cotton Trading Fails to Develop

Regarding foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market was initially firm, with reports from Liverpool and Mumbai indicating rising prices. At the same time, fellow merchants also engaged in some trading in the market, so prices were able to maintain their original levels. Subsequently, news from Washington indicated that Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace would convene a meeting with domestic cotton industry leaders this week to discuss the export subsidy plan proposed by the government. Fellow merchants were deeply concerned that there might be complications with the government's export subsidy plan, which led to long positions taking profits, and the market price saw a slight decline of 7 or 8 points. Indian cotton, along with predictions, fell by one rupee. The Egyptian market was closed.

Shanghai foreign cotton trading has seen little progress in recent days due to a lack of financial progress, and the scope of circulation has become increasingly narrow. Banks continue to refuse to provide loans for cotton, and fellow merchants are also continuing to delay payments to foreign firms under various pretexts. However, it is rumored that there will be a solution to the financial situation after mid-month, so all parties are waiting patiently.

The trading of Chinese and foreign cotton has gradually become more active, and factories are taking steps to purchase. However, large-scale business still lacks the possibility of development, largely due to the extreme shortage of legal tender, which prevents activity. New Yu Factory imported 800 bales of 10-count raw Indian cotton, calculated by remittance. 600 bales of cotton sent from Tianjin by the post office were purchased at a price of 106 yuan, with 20% in cash and 80% by remittance. Judging from the overall situation of the cotton market, it remains in a state of neither life nor death. The source of supply from Subei is relatively smooth, with 736 bales of Tonghua cotton arriving at the dock. The current cotton situation is listed on the left.

### Piece Goods: White Goods Continue to Decline, Domestic Cloth

Yesterday, the selling prices of white goods and summer bleaching and dyeing cloths in the market continued to decline, with each piece falling by 5 cents to 2 dimes. Due to abundant inventory, the prices of colored cloth and printed cloth are also unstable, and there are many differences in quoted prices. Actual sales were most active in the areas of Mazhang and Leizhou in Guangdong Province, with more than 5,000 pieces of colored materials, colored cloth, printed cloth, thread tweed, tribute drill, and other goods being traded. The Yunnan contingent hoped that the daily postal parcels would be restored, so there was some activity in various goods, with more than 3,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, printed cloth, crepe cloth, and bedsheets being traded. The areas of Funing and Xinghua in northern Jiangsu purchased more than 2,000 pieces of poplin, satin drill, and other goods. The Xu'zhou and Bengbu areas along the Jinpu Railway still have a healthy demand, with more than 2,000 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, and printed satin being traded. Large quantities of plain fine cloth and printed cloth were sold to the eastern provinces. The retail business in the local street was slightly better, with white goods, coarse cloth, and seasonal poplin and printed cloth being continuously replenished. Due to the tightness of credit, most people have no intention of renewing their orders for autumn goods. Dyeing factories purchased more than 100 bales of fine materials because customers had a way to sell colored twill.

Eastern Cloth

Fine cloth and fine twill are still falling due to weak actual sales. Yesterday, the lowest spot price for Longtou fine cloth in the morning market was only 13.45 yuan, a further decrease of 1.5 dimes per piece compared to the weekend. Later, the Dongmian Foreign Company offered more than 100 bales of August Longtou fine cloth futures at a price of 14 yuan per piece, and the spot market price slightly stabilized, returning to 13.5 yuan. Because the weather has been hot recently, the market only does business for half a day, so the number of transactions for the whole day is even more sparse. Local merchants and dyeing factories purchased about 500 pieces of fine twill.

Export

Today, 25 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, another 50 pieces to Siam, and another 65 pieces to Yantai, subject to environmental control.

### Food: Flour Subject to Environmental Control, Stalemate as Before, New Wheat Market Gradually Weakens, Another Ship of Foreign Wheat is About to Arrive

The current flour market situation remains sluggish. The volume of purchases by customer groups is stagnant due to cash and exchange rate issues. The northern market has not resolved the Tianjin concession issue, and there are reports that foreign flour is also being supplied there. In the southern market, it is reported that the war has resumed in the Minhai Estuary, and sales in Fuzhou and Shantou are even less likely to develop. Therefore, the sales channels for flour from large suppliers are controlled by the environment, forming a stalemate. Currently, factory flour relies only on scattered purchases from the local street, so the market is bleak and lifeless. Although the spot price of No. 2 flour is still conservatively maintained at 4.65 yuan in cash, the returned goods have already been sold at a price of 5 yuan by remittance, so it is no wonder that customers are not interested. The total number of transactions in Mujie and inland areas is estimated to be more than 10,000 bags, and the market is depressed and may be difficult to open up for a while.

On the 11th, 2,000 bags of flour were shipped to Weihaiwei and 5,000 bags to Tianjin.

The new wheat market situation has shown signs of weakness. The main source of supply is still the Huning Railway area, and the arrival of goods is not overwhelming. However, sales have been sluggish recently, and rice prices have also started to fall. Therefore, local hoarders have rarely shown interest, and purchases by Chinese factories remain stagnant, only supplying to Japanese factories. It is also reported that the supply from the Jinpu Railway can be accessed, and the market is gradually weakening. Yesterday, the market sold a total of more than 1,500 bags of wheat from Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Danyang, and Lingkou, priced at 6.9 to 6.65 yuan, all of which were purchased by Japanese factories.

Another ship of foreign wheat will arrive tomorrow, managed by Jardine Matheson & Co.'s "Roahlej," which is transporting 8,889 tons of wheat from Australia and is expected to arrive at the port tomorrow morning, mooring at buoys 15 and 16 for unloading and transfer.

### Warehouse Goods All Seek Quick Sale, Rice Prices Plunge, Fengjing Thin Rice Plummets 8 Jiao

Dugeng: The sources from various groups and He'xia total the fifth, the number of Chaolun Baozi Fengjing goods is nearly 2000. Since the holiday break on Sunday, the sales on the local street were even more sluggish yesterday. The mainland groups only moved a little. The sellers have been changing due to the hot weather. They all want to sell quickly, resulting in a glut of goods. The situation is sluggish, and the more it falls, the more severe it becomes. As a result, there were still few transactions. Changxi, and other geng have already fallen 2 or 3 dimes. Sutung geng sold not a single grain of rice. The arrival of Fengjing thin rice was abundant, and the rice quality was poor. The abandonment was terrible, reaching a huge 7 or 8 dimes. Other kinds of thin rice also fell 3 or 4 dimes.

Kexian: Most of the mainland groups suspended operations yesterday. Although there were small inquiries in the afternoon, the transaction volume was only 400 to 500 bags. The high prices of all grades decreased by 3 or 4 dimes across the board. Nanjing xian only opened at 16.5 yuan, and Gaowu xian at 16.4 yuan. The old rice in the intermediate price was even weaker. However, after the price fell, the local street took the opportunity to handle a little. The total transaction volume for the day was still 1,700 to 1,800 bags.

### Oilcake: Slight Heat Season Sunny Day, Soybean Cake Sales Increase, Silver Futures Wide Spread Oil Price Increase

Since the industry agreed on a ten-day silver futures period, people's hearts have felt comfortable, resulting in vigorous transactions and vitality. The current situation is briefly reported as follows:

Soybean cake: Because the Slight Heat season has passed, the intention of rain can be reduced, which is very beneficial to agricultural affairs. Therefore, the sales of soybean cake, a fertilizer, have increased. The transactions in the market have suddenly become lively, and the market has frequently seen an increase. As a result, it increased by 8 cents compared with last Saturday, totaling 15,000 to 16,000 pieces of Dalian Yuangi and miscellaneous brands, and the price rose from 3.111 yuan to 3.116 yuan. Also, 5,000 pieces of Tianjin Laisi brand light-edged cake came at a price of 3.1135 yuan. Yesterday, 44,170 pieces of soybean cake came from Tianjin.

Soybean oil: The sales are quite strong in the state of silver futures. The market is also in a situation where people are determined to see the price increase, resulting in the market price rising. Yesterday, each oil in the market暴涨 8 dimes to 1 yuan compared with the previous market. A total of 150 barrels of Lian oil came from Kobe (price details in the market price column), 300 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 150 pieces of Qingqi oil, 300 pieces of Yanqi oil, 900 cans of Tianjin canned oil. Yesterday, 1,370 cans of soybean oil came from Qingdao.

Raw oil: The local port groups have been continuing with their stomachs, and the market atmosphere is not out of the environment of soybean oil's advance. Therefore, the market price has also risen by 5 dimes to 1.5 yuan compared with the previous one. A total of 300 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at a price of 34.5 yuan, and 100 barrels of Dalian barrel oil was sold for 46.5 yuan. Today, 700 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong.

### Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Transactions Turn Quiet, Domestic Sugar Transactions Over 900 Bags

Yesterday, there were no changes in the telegraphs from Holland and Hong Kong in the sugar market, and the trend was still excellent. The association's agreed price for grade 24 coarse granulated sugar was 30 yuan for goods in local warehouses and 29.8 yuan for goods in outside warehouses, 21.65 yuan for re-export. Tai B mark was 31.4 yuan for Western warehouses, 3 dimes for Eastern warehouses, CW 31 yuan, CX 30.07 yuan, DY 30.04 yuan to 3 dimes, HX 30 yuan, H red 23 yuan, Dutch red the same price, 17 yuan for re-export. Local grade 1 white 29.5 yuan, grade 2 white 29 yuan, local grade 1 ice 35 yuan, Jingming ice 36.5 yuan, limited transactions. The Chaozhou group opened with more than 50 bags of full grade 3-pointed sugar, 30.02 yuan, 50 bags of fine red, 23.5 yuan, Huanggang Qing at 19.3 yuan to 5 dimes, high grade 19.7 yuan, a total of more than 300 bags. The Guangdong group opened with dozens of pieces of Huizhou white, 29.5 yuan, 130 bags of Donghai red, 21.5 yuan. The Min group opened with more than 150 bags of Zhangdiao Qing, as oil-wrapped goods, with an agreed price of 17.5 yuan, ordinary Xinghua tribute powder 28.5 yuan, with 150 bags transacted.

### Government Does Not Provide Foreign Exchange for Foreign Goods Imported into Shanghai, Shanghai Is a Lost Area, Customs Did Not Follow Government's Method, Exported Native Goods Were Also Not Sold to Government for Foreign Exchange, China and Communication Banks Have Not Received Head Office Order to Handle Application for Foreign Exchange

Since the Ministry of Finance announced the rules for applying to purchase foreign exchange for imported goods, it stipulates that imported goods operated by importers that are not prohibited from import and are necessary for the country may apply to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee to purchase foreign exchange. The Foreign Exchange Examination Committee is located in Chongqing, and applicants must apply to the committee in Chongqing. After approval and issuance of a notice to purchase foreign exchange, the application is designated to be handled by the China and Communication Banks. Regarding the implementation of this in Shanghai, the China and Communication Banks have not yet received orders from the head office, nor have they telegraphed the head office for instructions. The various situations are noted as follows:

Still Not Ordered

Since the Ministry of Finance announced the application for imported goods, it stipulates that imported goods operated by importers that are not prohibited from import and are necessary for the country, after applying to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee to purchase foreign exchange, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank has been ordered to stop supplying statutory foreign exchange. Therefore, weekly applications for foreign exchange have been suspended from acceptance. However, the Shanghai Branch of the China and Communication Banks had not received orders from the head office to handle the matter of acting as an agent for applying for foreign exchange as of yesterday.

Shanghai Prohibits Application

Since the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank was ordered to stop supplying statutory foreign exchange, general importers have been inquiring with the China and Communication Banks about the application process. However, the two banks replied that they could not accept because they had not received orders. Because Shanghai is a lost area, native goods exported by Shanghai Customs in the past have never been sold to the national bank for foreign exchange in accordance with the measures for settlement of export goods. Since the issuance of the ban on imports of non-essential goods, the Jianghai Customs has not implemented it. Therefore, in the future, various industries in Shanghai will not be able to apply to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee for foreign exchange for imported foreign goods, unless specially approved by the government.

Black Market Foreign Exchange

Since the foreign HSBC bank in Shanghai continued to supply the needs of all parties in accordance with the principle of 6.5 pence for British exchange and 12.625 yuan for US exchange, trading has not been as prosperous as before in recent days due to currency contraction. However, speculators mostly absorbed July and sold August to implement arbitrage trading. In recent days, because the China and Communication Banks have not received orders to handle applications for foreign exchange, the foreign goods imported by various importers have still purchased foreign exchange in the black market. The supply of foreign banks is still smooth, and the exchange rate is relatively stable.

### Japanese Transportation Across Tangqi Was Attacked, Four Japanese Were Seriously Injured, Fu Was Fiercely Attacked by Sixty Guerrillas, Four Japanese Came to Shanghai and Entered Fumin Hospital

The English "Da Mei Evening News" said that according to Japanese sources, Kimura Kurao, Murakami Katsunosuke, Nakamura Hiromi, and Koike Katsunosuke, the manager and employees of the Shanghai Inland Navigation Company's Hangzhou Branch, set off from Hangzhou at 7:00 AM on July 5 to investigate the route to Shanghai and Suzhou via Jiaxing. At 2:00 PM, when the ship arrived at Tangqi Town, 20 kilometers north of Hangzhou, it was suddenly attacked by 60 Chinese guerrillas armed with rifles and grenades. The Japanese also fired back. Three Japanese people suffered serious injuries to their heads and abdomens. The Japanese garrison at Gongchen Bridge, south of Tangqi Town, rushed to the scene after hearing the gunshots, but it was too late. They carried the four Japanese to the Japanese military hospital in Hangzhou for treatment. On Saturday and Sunday, they were transferred to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road in Shanghai for treatment. The attacked Japanese people have differing opinions on whether these Chinese were local guerrillas or soldiers of the 73rd Division of the Chinese Army.

It is heard that a method of repayment has been set, with the Unified payment on July 31, the Reconstruction payment on August 31, and the Jin Chang payment on September 30. As for the method, it will be announced by the Ministry of Finance. According to Lin Kanghou, the government's policy of maintaining credit is consistent throughout.

Yesterday's closing prices were 59.9 yuan for the Unified Bonds (Type A), 50.35 yuan for Type B, 48.85 yuan for Type C, 48.35 yuan for Type D, and 48.7 yuan for Type E, slightly lower than last Saturday due to rumors in the market of payments in Chongqing.

### Taikoo's Suzhou Ship Sails to Siam This Morning, Also to Wan, Shantou, Hong Kong, and Saigon, Besides Loading Goods, Passengers Can Also Board

British shipping in China has always held the top position. Since being affected by the Japanese blockade of the ports, it has been in extreme decline. In order to maintain their shipping industry in China, British companies such as Taikoo and Jardine Matheson are opposing any obstacles and have asked the British Navy to send warships to escort them. Now, because the coasts of North China have been monopolized by Japanese ships, they plan to develop in South China and have decided to change the Shantou-Siam line to the Shanghai-Siam line. They have designated Taikoo's Suzhou ship, with a gross tonnage of 2,646 tons and a net tonnage of 1,676 tons, to load goods and passengers from Shanghai at 10:00 AM this morning and sail to Shantou, Hong Kong, Saigon, and then to Bangkok, Siam.

### Shanghai Ships Sailing to Ningbo Approved One After Another, Impact of Suspension Reduced, Still Stopping Outside Zhenhai Port for Transfer by Small Ships, De Ping Approved to Set Sail Directly to Zhenhai This Morning

Ningbo Zhenhai Port is prohibited from navigation due to defense reasons, and the Shanghai-Ningbo shipping route is interrupted. The shipping industry in this port has submitted an application to the Zhejiang Provincial authorities in order to maintain shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang, allowing ships to anchor outside Zhenhai Port. After the successful resumption of navigation by the Mufuku Ship, the shipping route between Shanghai and Ningbo has been approved by the authorities. The ships that have been approved include the Mufuku of the German Lishi Yangxing, the De Ping of the Italian Zhongyi Company, the Hana of the Far East Company is applying, and the British Taikoo Company's Xin Beijing also intends to join. Once approved, it can set sail. However, because of the blockade of Zhenhai, all ships will be diverted to Qiliyu outside the port of Zhenhai, and goods and passengers will be transferred to the Ningbo Pier through the blockade line by small steamboats and civilian ships. It is also stipulated that the transfer time will be from 6:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning, so the departure time of each ship from Shanghai is set at 4:00 AM, so that it can arrive at Qiliyu at 5:00 PM, and unload and transfer the goods that night.

Mufuku Arrives De Ping Sets Sail

The resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo is going smoothly with the German Mufuku ship. The ship continued to sail on the morning of the 8th and has arrived safely. The ship is currently transferring passengers and goods in Zhenhai Port and will return to Shanghai in the next few days. The De Ping ship of the Italian Zhongyi Company is scheduled to set sail for Ningbo this morning, and the German Hana ship is scheduled to depart on the 13th. The Xin Beijing ship will be scheduled after returning to Shanghai from Quanzhou. However, the round-trip flights are slower due to the troublesome transfer procedures.

Passengers and Cargo Must Be Guaranteed

After the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo, the Ningbo garrison has not relaxed its defense and has imposed strict restrictions on incoming and outgoing passengers and goods. Incoming passengers must have a considerable guarantee, and outgoing passengers are limited to the elderly, weak, women, and children. However, in order to facilitate merchants to come and go to collect accounts, all legitimate merchants holding certificates from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and seeking local shop guarantees are allowed to export. Imported goods are limited to food, kerosene, raw materials, and medicines.

Xin Anli Ship Still Intends to Sail to Dinghai

Since the Japanese army landed in Dinghai, the Shanghai-Dinghai route has been affected and suspended. Recently, the Swedish Ruifeng Yangxing rented the Xin Anli ship and resumed sailing from Shanghai to Dinghai and also to Wanshan and Daishan on the 6th. It was blocked and returned, and the resumption of navigation failed. It is now known that the company is currently trying to dredge, and it is difficult to predict whether it can resume navigation. However, the situation in Dinghai has not recovered, and even if navigation resumes, the transportation of passengers and goods will be very quiet.

Transportation Difficulties Between Shanghai and Zhejiang Resolved

The original Shanghai-Zhejiang shipping routes included the Shanghai-Ningbo, Shanghai-Wenzhou, Shanghai-Taizhou, and Shanghai-Dinghai routes. Each port was successively blocked due to defense reasons. After the Shanghai-Zhejiang shipping was completely cut off, the Shanghai-Ningbo route has now implemented indirect resumption of navigation. Therefore, the difficulties encountered in the Shanghai-Zhejiang suspension of navigation can be slightly resolved. As for the Wenzhou Haimen route, there is temporarily no hope of resumption of navigation. However, the shipping industry is preparing to restore the Min Province Shacheng route, and one can detour from Shanghai to Wenzhou.

### Guerrillas Capture Zhangjiagang, Flights From Shanghai Are Waiting to Be Restored

The Continental Press reports that the local American official circles have received reliable news from Washington that a proposal to award Admiral Yarnell, Commander-in-Chief of the United States Asiatic Fleet, with a special medal in recognition of his work in the Far East over the past three years has been submitted to the United States Congress. The sponsors of this proposal are Senators Gillette and Harrington from Iowa, Admiral Yarnell's former district. Admiral Yarnell is originally from Independence City, Iowa. The news received here regarding this case is not detailed, but it is said that Congress is expected to take action on this case before the end of the current session. It is generally believed that a majority of both houses of Congress will vote in favor of awarding the medal.

If Congress passes the medal award proposal, then President Roosevelt will award this special medal to Admiral Yarnell in Washington after he returns to the country next month. Admiral Yarnell is currently on his flagship, the Augusta, in the North China Sea. He recently took a short trip to Beiping and is expected to return to Shanghai next week, where he will meet with Admiral Hepburn, who is scheduled to take over as Commander of the Asiatic Fleet this month. It is expected that Admiral Yarnell will depart from Shanghai to Washington in early August, possibly on August 1st.

### Inland Newspapers Switching to Local Paper: Southeast Daily and Other Zhejiang Province Newspapers All Switching to Local Paper Printing

Since the tightening of foreign exchange, the price of imported paper has soared, with white paper costing about eight yuan per ream. Due to transportation disruptions, paper prices have risen even higher in inland provinces. All newspapers and publications in Zhejiang Province have been using domestic paper since the first of this month. According to people from Zhejiang Province, the Zhejiang Provincial Wartime Education and Culture Affairs Committee, in view of the fact that since the war of resistance, the development of newspapers has been like bamboo shoots after the rain, and that most of the paper used is not domestic, convened a symposium of chief editors of publications in the province and a symposium of chief editors of publications in the Jinhua area to discuss the use of local paper in various newspapers and periodicals. All agreed that it is better to promote domestic goods, benefit the people's livelihood, and stop the leak. The committee had test-printed several issues of the "Common People" semi-monthly publication using light-colored local paper, and the results were quite satisfactory. The price was far cheaper than foreign paper, so it initiated a local paper movement to promote attention to the issue of local paper in various places. The committee then completed a survey of the production volume and paper prices of local paper in Zhejiang Province, as well as the demand of various magazines. The Southeast Daily Zhengbao and Juesheng Printing House, etc., have now adopted local paper since July 1st. Other bookstores, magazine publishers, etc., in various places have also responded enthusiastically, either by switching to local paper or by purchasing from wallpaper factories.

### Big Regiment Guerrilla Forces Relocated to Villages in the Suburbs

The Japanese army's general offensive on Pudong, which first occupied the county town of Nanhui, has been going on for many days. There have been no troops or police in the town for two months, and there is no so-called "maintenance society." All the guerrilla forces are gathered near the Big Regiment. Because of the continuous bombing of the Big Regiment by Japanese planes in recent days, the guerrilla forces were forced to withdraw from the town and remain stationed in the suburbs. It is said that the Japanese army does not intend to occupy the town for a long time after entering the town and has the intention of withdrawing, but the future situation of the area is still unpredictable.

### Hitler's Representative Carrying a Personal Letter to Japan: Scheduled to Pass Through Shanghai Next Week for a Short Stay; Hotel Staff Participated in Political Work

The Continental Press reports that Reuter from the Sudetenland region of Eger, Germany, is scheduled to pass through Shanghai next week on the Gneisenau en route to Japan. It is widely believed that Reuter is a special messenger carrying a private letter from the Chancellor of the Third Reich, Hitler, to Tokyo. Although the rumor that Reuter is Hitler's personal messenger could not be confirmed in Shanghai last night (the 9th), the local German newspaper Oastasiatiseher LIlyd acknowledged yesterday morning that a person from Eger is expected to arrive soon. According to the German daily, Reuter is a special staff member of the German leader, and this trip to Japan will last nine weeks. However, the newspaper gives the impression that the 28-year-old Reuter is on a pleasure trip. It also states that Reuter made special contributions to the German leader during the Sudetenland crisis last September, and that Reuter, as a member of the Sudeten German Social Democratic Party, gained considerable fame when Germany invaded Bohemia and Moravia. The German daily also stated that before the Sudetenland crisis last September, Reuter was an employee of the Victoria Hotel in Eger. He met Hitler while working at the hotel, and this publicly funded trip is a reward for his service to the National Socialist Party. The local NSDAP (National Socialist Organization) and the German community will hold a formal celebration, the details of which will be announced later this week, to welcome this 28-year-old youth. It is expected that Reuter will stay here for several days. Although the local German newspaper claims that Reuter is on a pleasure trip, it was learned from reliable sources in Shanghai last night that Reuter's trip to Japan has some political significance and that he is carrying an important private letter from Hitler to Tokyo.

Da Guang News Agency reports that the Ministry of Economic Affairs has recently ascertained that five Chinese-owned factories in the city, including the Minsheng Weaving Factory, have been occupied by the Japanese. The products of these factories should be prohibited in accordance with the regulations on the prohibition of enemy goods. Yesterday, a special telegram was sent to inform the various domestic goods organizations in the city. The original text is as follows:

### Upper Harbor of Beisha Still Not Open: British Ships, Protected by British Warships, Sail to Sanhe Harbor for Loading and Unloading

The three ports on the Upper Harbor of Beisha Line, after being bombed and ravaged by Japanese warships and planes, have become ruins, no different from dead cities. Only because these three ports are connected to the coastal areas of the Eastern China Sea, and are accessible in all directions, do passengers and goods rely on them for transshipment to Shanghai. Since being blockaded by the Japanese army and ordered to load and unload at Qinglong Harbor, the situation is special, and the practical difficulties are numerous. Therefore, merchant ships docked at Qinglong Harbor rarely load passengers and goods. British merchant ships, protected by the British warship "Mosquito," sail upstream and dock at Sanhe Harbor for loading and unloading passengers and goods, which maintains commercial transportation. Although the British and German consulates have lodged representations with the Japanese side regarding the resumption of navigation in the Upper Harbor, the Japanese side has blamed the naval authorities and has delayed responding, without any success. Therefore, the Upper Harbor of Beisha is still unable to open for navigation.

### Bank Apprentice Bewitched by Sex and Wealth: 1,000 Yuan in Legal Tender Swindled; Cornered and Arrested; Sun Huiqing Sentenced to One Year in Prison

Wang Changchun, an apprentice at Xingtai Bank, was ordered by his master to withdraw 1,000 yuan in cash from the bank on March 30th. While passing through Nanjing Road, he was lured by the con man Sun Huiqing (age 43, from Ningbo) to Hongmiao, under the guise of teaching magic tricks under the name of a strange magic teaching society, teaching him magic transformations such as "copper coins turning into banknotes," "one yuan turning into ten yuan," and "calling out the female beauty you think of, without having to pursue her, she will come on her own." Wang was lured into obsession by money and sex and immediately handed over the 1,000 yuan in banknotes to Sun, demanding that he quickly install the magic so that he could practice the transformation. Sun, after obtaining the money, then arranged with Wang to continue teaching the secret the next morning at Hongmiao, claiming that the required incantations were not complete and it was inconvenient to teach him immediately. Wang Changchun believed him, but months passed, and there was no sign of Sun at Hongmiao. It was not until the 3rd of this month that Wang Changchun met him (at the intersection of Shandong Road and Fuzhou Road), shouted for help, grabbed him, and brought him to the Central Police Station. After investigation by detectives, it was confirmed and he was sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The case was continued yesterday in the First Criminal Court by Judge Xiao Xieffen, who first recorded that the victim, Wang Changchun, stated that he was 19 years old and an apprentice at the bank, and that on March 30th, he met the defendant, who pulled me over and said that he would teach me how to get rich quickly and marry a beautiful wife. I was deceived by his words and handed over 1,000 yuan to him. Then, according to the defendant Sun Huiqing, the magic is fake, and anyone with a little knowledge knows it completely, but even though everyone knows it is fake, many people think of it as a kind of game. I only took four or five yuan to learn it, and I never used the words money or sex to cheat him (referring to Wang Changchun) out of 1,000 yuan. After verifying the words in court, the judge announced the conclusion of the trial and sentenced Sun Huiqing to one year in prison for using fraud to cause others to deliver property.

### Lin from Suzhou, Waiting for His Uncle at the Pier, Drowned in the Huangpu River

Lin Feng, a 20-year-old man from Suzhou, lived at a certain number on Avenue Joffre. He was studying at a certain middle school. Recently, the school had summer vacation, and he was studying at home. A few days ago, he received a telegram from his uncle in Tokyo, Japan, stating that he had departed from Tokyo to return to Shanghai and that the ship was scheduled to arrive at the port at around 7:00 p.m. on the 9th. After receiving the telegram, Lin Feng went to the New Customs Wharf on time, intending to take a small steamer to the ship to meet his uncle. While boarding the ship, it is not known how, Lin Feng and three unknown people all accidentally fell into the Huangpu River. Two people were rescued by the water police station's lifeboat, but Lin Feng and one other person joined the Sea God. After a moment, they disappeared without a trace. It was not until around 10:00 a.m. yesterday that the bodies of the two people floated to the surface of the Huangpu River. The police arranged to retrieve the two bodies. After family members sent people to take the bodies to the funeral home, they notified the police station, which transported the bodies to Renji Hospital for a coroner's examination.

### Old Woman Hangs Herself: Not Reported to the Authorities

Hu Mei, an old woman from Dongtai, aged 72, lived at No. 41, Jija Lane, No. 410 Jin Shenfu Road, Dapu Bridge, French Concession. Recently, because the lease period for the land on which she built her house had expired, the landlord ordered her to demolish the house and return the land. Her son, Hu Guibao, was forced to dismantle the house, sell the lumber, and return the leased land, leading to a dispute between mother and son. The cursed Hu woman then took her own life by hanging herself from the bed frame at home at 7:00 a.m. on the 8th. Afterwards, her son did not report the incident to the police but immediately placed her in a coffin that afternoon. The next day, he moved the coffin to a boat on the Suzhou Creek on Binlang Road, intending to transport it back to his hometown for burial. It was not until yesterday that the French police suddenly received a mailed letter reporting the circumstances of Hu's suicide.

### Record of Qian Zhuang Elder Mr. Qin Runqing (Part 1)

— Zhou

"Not seeking personal gain, not failing due to incompetence; begin with the individual, so shall the career be." These are a few thought-provoking words that were deeply imprinted in my mind after interviewing Mr. Qin Runqing. Here, I present these words first, hoping that young people will pay extra attention to them, accept the wise words of successful people, and regard them as guiding principles. Although I ran up several marble staircases in a sweat, I felt that the price was very worthwhile.

In a purely Chinese-style guest room where the southern breeze gently wafted, upon seeing the rosewood furniture and the water pipe on Mr. Qin's desk, I couldn't help but feel a sense of "I was born too late"; but at the same time, I also thought that such a clean, beautiful, and antique environment was particularly lovely.

Mr. Qin said very modestly: I entered school in Mengguan as a child. My family was poor. I left my hometown of Cixi at the age of sixteen and came to Shanghai to work. Later, although I studied hard in the ways of learning, I still often felt the importance of education. Therefore, more than ten years ago, I founded Pudi Elementary School in Cixi, hoping to give ordinary people without the means to study the opportunity to read. In recent years, I have purchased ancient and modern books and prepared to establish Moyunlou Library in Cixi. There are now over 12,000 ancient books and over 10,000 modern books, which are available for public reading. It has now been decided to donate this collection to society. From this, one can see Mr. Qin's enthusiasm for culture and education. He said: He has no special hobbies in his life. If there is a hobby to speak of, it is only seeking out books.

He recalled everything about coming to Shanghai to learn his trade as a child, saying that forty-eight years have passed in a flash. Although he does not comment on the rise in the cost of living and the development of the prosperous city, his tone contains infinite emotion about the current situation. Only his spirit of "dedication and enjoyment of work" shows his optimism and excitement. In his conversation, he seemed to have forgotten his gray hair and recalled the innocent childhood. He has always worked at the Xieyuan, now Fuyuan Qian Zhuang (money exchange), not only without being bored but also becoming more dedicated to the service of his profession over time. I think this is Mr. Qin's path to success, and it is also a warning to young people who are fickle nowadays.

He has devoted his full efforts to the reform of the qian industry throughout his life. In the eleventh and twelfth years of the Republic of China, Mr. Nie Yuntai and he served as the chairman and vice-chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. He vigorously advocated the establishment of a library and a commodity exhibition hall, which were eventually founded by them. He is the only elder in the qian industry, and he is also involved in all public welfare activities of the qian industry. Everyone knows this, so there is no need to repeat it here.

Since the rise of the banking industry, qian zhuang businesses seem to inevitably suffer from the limitations of business development due to the roughly same business. I hoped to raise this point and discuss it with Mr. Qin before visiting him. After meeting Mr. Qin, I felt that the organization, vault, and other facilities of Fuyuan, or even banks with less capital, did not have his scale. Therefore, qian zhuang naturally have a reason to exist. This idea grew stronger in my mind. Next, I wanted Mr. Qin to elaborate on the future of the qian zhuang. (To be continued)

### The Success of Gonadal Endocrine Therapy: Marital Happiness Can Be Guaranteed Without Worry

Some people say: "Life is suffering! That's why babies cry when they are born from the womb!" Although this is a religious saying, there are indeed many men and women in the world who turn good things into bad things, and turn joy into unhappiness. Therefore, they blame heaven and others, and are overwhelmed by their misery! Mutual affection between men and women, and love between husband and wife, should be the happiest thing in life. However, due to the deficiency of gonadal endocrine, men often suffer from spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, neurasthenia, etc. Even with beautiful consorts in this fragrant and sensual summer, even at the height of the act, happiness is often shattered like fleeting smoke, or they are completely unable to perform. In an instant, all that remains is hatred and sorrow!

According to medical judgment, the deficiency of male gonads is mostly due to early self-abuse, nocturnal emissions, or licentious indulgence, which consumes too much gonadal fluid. Then, the above symptoms are difficult to avoid. In the past, when medicine was not very advanced, many doctors knew little about the crux of these symptoms, and were often helpless in treatment. However, since the gonadal endocrine study of the nineteenth century shone brightly, it has been known that gonadal endocrine has a unique function in each stage of our life. In childhood, the development of shape, appearance, and weight is almost entirely manipulated by it. After the onset of puberty, in addition to carrying out reproductive functions, its endocrine irrigates the whole body through the blood, promoting development, adjusting metabolism, and nourishing the brain, spinal cord, and various nerves in sexual areas. Therefore, it has a very important and huge impact on our development, health, life, character, love, and eugenics.

Recently, amazing success has been achieved in gonadal endocrine therapy. After more than thirty years of arduous experiments, an Austrian medical saint extracted gonadal hormones from robust animals such as apes, gorillas, bears, and deer, and replicated them into a drug using scientific methods, which is named "Gonadotrophin." Repeated experiments have shown that its effect is miraculous, as the saying goes, "the right medicine is like opening a lock." It has also been proven by millions of doctors around the world that this medicine can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, invigorate the blood, and nourish the nerves within 24 hours after taking it. Continuing to take it for half a month can help promote development and adjust metabolism. All the above symptoms will be completely cured. Long-term use can prolong life, and middle-aged and elderly people can achieve the effect of rejuvenating. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Hemitol's Spermatocelin" (available in Yong'an Xianshi Pharmacy and Sino-French, Sino-Western, Wuzhou and other major pharmacies) to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that both the symptoms and the root cause can be treated, and the effect will be rapid!

### Spermatorrhea is the Premonitory Symptom of Kidney Deficiency and Brain Weakness

— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist

According to the normal state of physiological development, young people should have rich minds and abundant energy. Therefore, their thinking ability, discrimination ability, and decision-making ability are constantly improving! Such young people are the treasures of society and the future masters of the nation. However, the young people of today are quite different from what we expect. Eight or nine out of ten are sallow and emaciated, slow-thinking, look sleepy when they are sitting at a desk, and appear tired when they are working! In terms of sexual function, they often have spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, neurasthenia, etc. Sexual desire is most easily impulsive. They spend all day seeking pleasure, and are seen through by modern women, resulting in endless pain from broken love! Even in married life, due to kidney deficiency and weakness, they are often resentful, and the family is plunged into a tragic situation!

How did these fine young people get to this point? According to medical judgment, most of them have committed self-abuse and indulgence in their early years, leading to spermatorrhea. If spermatorrhea is not treated, the gonadal endocrine fluid will be exhausted, and the above symptoms are inevitable. In addition, there are relatively few cases of congenital weakness, postpartum disorders, and excessive brain or physical exertion leading to the above symptoms. Since we understand the cause of the disease, it is easier to treat. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking "Hemitol's Spermatocelin Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage is the only effective treatment for the symptoms. At the same time, taking the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadotrophin" to nourish the brain, kidneys, essence, and blood, and to nourish the nerves and promote development, is the only effective treatment for the root cause. Treating both the symptoms and the root cause will surely restore perfect health in a short period of time.

Patient Tang Ronghua, from Qingpu, 26 years old, committed self-abuse during his student days, followed by spermatorrhea. Half a year later, his brain power was extremely weak, and he had insomnia and night sweats at night. He barely graduated from middle school and failed to enter university. He married a year ago, but due to premature ejaculation and impotence, sexual intercourse was difficult and boring, and his brain weakness became more severe. Therefore, he sought treatment from me. I immediately instructed him to take "Hemitol's Spermatocelin Tablets" and "Gonadotrophin," and at the same time, I performed electrotherapy injections. After a month of careful treatment, he was completely recovered. Recently, I heard that Mr. Tang is teaching in an elementary school, and his love with his wife is getting deeper and deeper, and his life is very happy.

### The Breasts are the Key to Femininity

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

"Two points of appearance, seven points of dress." I don't really agree with this sentence, and it's a bit unreasonable. Imagine: a woman with a withered face, high cheekbones, deep eye sockets, a thin body, narrow hips, a flat chest, and no prominent breasts. Even if you ask this kind of woman to wear the most expensive lace cheongsam, apply powder and rouge, and walk on the street, I know that not only will no one say she is beautiful, but they will even look at her like a living monster! On the contrary, if this woman has a beautiful face, even bones and muscles, full hips, and a pair of elastic breasts rising high in front of her chest, slightly showing a rise and fall as she moves, then even if she has messy hair and rough clothes and no makeup, she will naturally have a supreme beauty that is set off from all around her. It is not diminished because she is not dressed up. Therefore, I think "dress" is just some green leaves on the peony. The main point of beauty is in the person itself. If there are defects in the person itself, such as shriveled breasts, narrow hips, withered face, and loss of beauty, the only way to save it is to immediately use the globally renowned gonadal ovarian preparation for women, "Gonadotrophin," for nourishment. This preparation was invented by the former Austrian medical saint, Dr. Stana, after more than thirty years of arduous experiments. After taking it for one day and night, it can nourish ovarian function, promote metabolism, adjust menstruation, and eliminate uterine disorders. If you continue to take it, it will surely make the shriveled breasts gradually rise high, and the thin hips become more plump day by day. At that time, your cheeks will be delicate and your curves will be obvious. Even if you don't wear gorgeous clothes, I guarantee that when you enter and exit social occasions, you will naturally be like the moon surrounded by stars. Someone will respect you, love you, and pursue you enthusiastically. You can really look around and enjoy happiness.

### New Advances in Gonorrhea Treatment

Gonorrhea treatment has recently made new advances, and the face of the disease has been renewed. Gonorrhea is difficult to cure and its infectiousness is unusually strong and rapid. Therefore, it is extremely widespread, especially in prosperous metropolises, where its power is fierce, surpassing even the flooding of rivers. Moreover, its harm is not limited to the individual, but also infects their wives and passes it on to their children. It is truly what is called poisoning three generations. Now, due to new advances in gonorrhea treatment, this rampant gonorrhea has a tendency to be stopped. In the era before the advancement of science, it was believed that gonorrhea was a disease of the urethra. Therefore, the treatment method was nothing more than local surgery to wash the urethra. Over-the-counter proprietary medicines taken internally are only intended to promote urination, and most have side effects. Know that gonorrhea can be eradicated in the acute stage. However, if the gonorrhea toxin has invaded the interior, the physiological structure gradually becomes complex, and gonorrhea bacteria can escape everywhere, then local surgical treatment and general proprietary medicines will inevitably miss the mark and have no practical effect in killing bacteria and expelling gonorrhea. Therefore, these treatments have long become historical relics. The most advanced treatment, the Lymph-Plexus Flow Electrotherapy, the latest invention in Germany, is indeed a major advance in physical therapy and a representative of advances in gonorrhea treatment. The most advanced hospitals in European countries have this electrotherapy equipment. Other methods, such as German Hee's Serum, autogenous vaccine, and Fei's prostate massage, are all modern scientific advances that have special treatments for gonorrhea that are noble and most authoritative, truly different from ordinary city doctors and inferior drugs.

### Ten Thousand Yuan Worth of Cotton Disappears; Destination Unknown; Uninvited Guest Ordered Delivery to Great Western Road; Rushed to Investigate, Only Half Remained; Car Driver and Laborers Arrested and Questioned

Unexpectedly, the factory had not received the goods by noon. They inquired with Lin Shun by telephone, and Hu Shouting of Lin Shun relayed the inquiry to Jiuda, who replied that when they started transporting in the morning, an uninvited guest of about forty years old, claiming to be a representative of Lin Shun, came with orders to change the destination of all the cotton to Great Western Road, so it was not delivered to Xinyu. Upon hearing this, Hu suspected something had happened and rushed to the area of the specified location on Great Western Road. There, he discovered that only half of the original cotton remained. According to rumors, the missing twenty-eight bales had been taken away in two trucks. Hu reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Detective Wang Wenbin and Western detective Teil were dispatched to investigate, but found no clues. Therefore, the car driver Zhou Fengchao and the five laborers Sun, Wu, Zhao, Yin, and Shi were arrested.

### Dies from Internal Injuries After Being Shoved; Court Opens Coffin for Autopsy; Quarrel Over Inheritance Due to Dispute Over Finding Elderly Mother; Family Members Awaiting Summons to Court for Prosecution

Fan Siyu, a Chaozhou native residing at No. 23 Yufu Lane, Iron Gate Entrance, Pierre Street, French Concession, 33 years old, had been suffering from lung disease for more than ten years. He was the son of the late Fan Jiwu, the owner of the opium paste shop, Fan Jiwu. He had nine brothers, and his elderly mother was still alive. On the afternoon of the 6th of this month, at 7 o'clock, the brothers argued over the distribution of the inheritance, causing their mother to leave in anger and not return for two days and nights. On that day, Siyu's younger brother Silou, fifth younger brother Sihong, and sixth younger brother Sizhang went to Siyu's place to ask about their mother's whereabouts, and another conflict arose. Sihong pushed Siyu violently, causing him to vomit blood instantly. He was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital, but died before treatment could be given. The body had been sent to the Shanghai Funeral Home for burial. After the French police reported the incident based on the report of the deceased's wife, Fan Guo, on Saturday at noon, they sent detectives to hoist Fan Siyu's coffin to the Forensic Examination Office of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch. All the details of the Second Special Court's autopsy have been recorded in this newspaper. After seeing the newspaper report, Fan Silou, Fan Sihong, and Fan Sizhang hired lawyer Wang Liwu to send letters to various newspapers to clarify and correct the inaccuracies, and to publish an advertisement. Yesterday morning, the French police requested Wang Ren, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, accompanied by forensic doctor Jiang and clerk Xi, to come to the office for examination at noon. At that time, the deceased's wife, Fan Guo, and the defendants Fan Silou, Fan Sihong, Fan Sizhang, and witness Guo A'ming (the deceased's cousin, who usually served Fan Siyu), had been summoned by the police officer to order workers to pry open the coffin lid and remove the body to place it on a mortuary bench and remove the burial clothes. After the forensic doctor performed the examination according to the law, the prosecutor ascended the judgment seat and questioned the plaintiff, the deceased's wife, Guo, and the witness Fan A'ming, who both testified that they had seen the defendants Fan Silou, Fan Sihong, and Fan Sizhang come together to ask the deceased about their mother's whereabouts. The deceased replied that he did not know, and Sihong pushed the deceased, causing him to vomit blood immediately. He was sent to Guangci Hospital, but died before treatment could be given. The defendants Fan Silou, Fan Sihong, and Fan Sizhang all denied pushing the deceased and causing him to vomit blood, saying that only at 11:00 AM on that day did the three brothers ask their second brother (the deceased) about their mother's whereabouts, and they should immediately post a notice to find her. Then they dispersed and there was no dispute or pushing. After receiving the testimony, Prosecutor Wang briefly inquired with the forensic doctor and concluded that Fan Siyu died of internal injuries caused by shock. The body was handed over to Fan Guo for burial. The defendants were taken to the police station for handling. After the autopsy, the family members returned the body to be reburied. In the afternoon at 3 o'clock, the police summoned the three defendants, their elderly mother (who had returned home after seeing the report on the 9th), the plaintiff, the deceased's wife Fan Guo, and the witnesses to the case for questioning, awaiting transfer to the court for legal prosecution.

### Tenant Accuses Landlord of Obstructing Freedom; Landlord Denies Allegations; Each Side Sticks to Its Story

Yangzhou native Pan Dalong, 27 years old, and his wife Luo Pan, (20 years old), hired a lawyer to accuse Chen Guowan and his wife of obstructing their freedom. According to the complaint, they rented a shop from Zhang Yongquan, who lived in the pavilion room at No. 13 Airen Lane, Fuxu Road, for a monthly rent of five yuan in October of last year. On June 9th, Zhang was arrested for smoking opium outside and was sentenced to three months in prison by the court. Therefore, the plaintiff resided in the pavilion room. Unexpectedly, on the 22nd of the same month, at 5:00 PM, Chen, accompanied by a Westerner and a translator from the police station, came and locked the door of the room, preventing the plaintiff from living inside. Therefore, they requested the court to order the defendant to open the pavilion room and to compensate them with two yuan in legal tender to cover the cost of lodging in a hostel. The court accepted the complaint, and Judge Jiang opened a court hearing the day before yesterday. The plaintiff's testimony was as above. However, according to the defendant Chen Guowan, the tenant Zhang Jicheng was arrested for smoking opium in the kitchen shed of Pan Youcai at No. 4 of the same lane. Pan escaped and suddenly hid in the pavilion room where Zhang lived with his children, occupying it and refusing to leave. Therefore, he reported to the police station to seal it off, waiting for Zhang to complete his sentence before applying for it to be reopened. Therefore, there was no obstruction of the plaintiff's freedom. After reviewing the testimony, the court found that further investigation was needed and ordered a postponement for further questioning.

### Gatekeeper's Service Pistol Goes Missing; How Did It Vanish?; Extremely Suspicious; Police Arrest and Thoroughly Investigate

Han Ruizhang, a Huabei police officer from Hubei Province and gatekeeper at No. 355 Lane, Maignan Road, was armed when he was on duty every day. Unexpectedly, at 6 o'clock in the evening of the day before yesterday, the police officer suddenly reported to the Gordon Road Police Station that a pistol with serial number 1317, along with five bullets, that he was carrying had mysteriously disappeared that afternoon. After receiving the report, the police chief believed that since the weapon had never been separated from him for a moment and there had been no theft, it was extremely suspicious why it had been lost, and the police officer could not explain it. Therefore, Han was immediately detained, and detective Wang Chengying and Western detective were dispatched to the alley to investigate. It was found that the alley only had one entrance and exit, and the entrance was equipped with an iron gate, making it difficult for accidents to occur. It was clear that the police officer had other secrets regarding the disappearance of the weapon. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court, and police lawyer Qian Xunjiu requested permission to detain the police officer for thorough investigation. Judge Dai briefly questioned Han and ordered him to be detained for further investigation and handling after clarification.

### Leg Sore; Illegal Treatment Results in Death; Itinerant Doctor Disregards Human Life; Failure to Seek Proper Medical Care Also Not Excusable

Wang Zhaobang, a surgeon from Shaoxing (37 years old), recently came to Shanghai from his hometown and set up a clinic at No. 666 North Zhejiang Road. Between the 3rd and 8th of this month, Hong Amao, a Ningbo native residing at No. 223 Gansu Road, suddenly developed a sore on his right leg that was unusually red and swollen. He and his wife Zhang hired a car to Wang's clinic twice for treatment. First, they prescribed disinfectant medicine for drinking and gave ointment for application, but both were ineffective and instead made it worse. The third time, they asked him to come home for treatment. He immediately performed surgery. The fourth time, he used a clay pot containing some kind of medicinal herbs, heated it with fire, and placed it on the leg to draw out the poison. Hong Amao felt very painful and even became comatose. Unexpectedly, he died at home at 6:00 AM on the 9th. His wife Zhang was grief-stricken and believed that Wang had used an abnormal surgical method, using a clay pot to heat the sore, which was the act of an itinerant doctor disregarding human life. Therefore, she reported the incident to the No. 1794 Huabei police, and they went to his clinic on North Zhejiang Road. They encountered each other on Gansu Road and often handed him over to the Huizhong Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Court 3 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan described the incident and requested that Dr. Wang be detained, adding that the body of the deceased Hong Amao was awaiting examination at the Forensic Examination Office. Zhang testified that her husband was killed by Wang's treatment. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing.

The apprentice did not know what a bomb was. While he was playing with it, he accidentally dropped it on the ground. It exploded immediately with a loud bang that shook the vicinity. At that time, apprentices Shen Zhongchu, 15 years old, Zhao Jinfa, 14 years old, and Xu Peisheng, 15 years old, were unable to escape and were all injured in the head and chest by shrapnel.

A Yancheng native named Xu Ji, who fired the shots, was apprehended on the spot by the police. After interrogation, Xu confessed that Chen Yanzhou was also involved and was hiding at 330 Fulvli Road. Detectives were dispatched to the address, but Chen had already fled. Only a Jiang Jiayou, who introduced Chen when he rented the house, was apprehended and brought to the police station and sent to the Special No. 2 Court for interrogation, with the case being adjourned. Details have already been reported in previous issues. Yesterday, the case was adjourned for continued trial.

They were brought back to the police station and sent to the Criminal Division 4 of the Special No. 1 Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, prosecuted Wang Shichang for the crime of privately possessing military weapons under Article 196 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Wang Shichang claimed that the military weapons were deposited in his house by a fugitive named Wu Si and were not privately possessed by him. After questioning by Judge Fang Qinghuan, the court announced its verdict: Wang was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment as a warning, and the confiscated guns and ammunition were confiscated.

### Case of Recovering Guarantee Money and Forgery: Truth Revealed Through Records: Defendant's Crime Significant, Court Orders Bail

Li Xiaodi, a 20-year-old native of Pudong, residing at Room 15, House 17, Lane 118, Avenue Notre Dame, and Cao Wenyu, a 30-year-old native of Pudong currently residing at No. 11, Lane 310, Route des Soeurs, (formerly working at Huili Company at 50 Ningbo Road in the French Concession, now working at Taishan Foreign Firm,) are cousins ​​through marriage. In March of last year, Cai ordered 20,000 bags of Chuzhou wheat from Cao at a price of $7.65 per bag. Subsequently, a dispute arose because Cao could not deliver the goods. Cai is now suing Cao in the Civil Division of the Special No. 2 Court to recover a deposit of $4,200 and compensation for breach of contract of $8,000. The China Record Company recorded the phone conversations between Cai and Cao as evidence. Cao proposed a settlement, claiming that the matter had been resolved amicably by settling with rice. However, Cai alleges that Cao stole his seal and forged the settlement agreement. Now, he has also engaged lawyer Xu Jinyu to file a private prosecution against Cao Wenyu in the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court for forgery and is seeking to recover the seal in a related civil suit. After one court hearing, the defendant failed to appear and the hearing was postponed. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Pengxian opened the court to announce a renewed hearing. The defendant appeared with his defense lawyer, Huang Huijie. First, the prosecuting attorney presented the charges, then the court questioned the defendant about the settlement agreement. Cao stated that he wrote the settlement agreement and that the plaintiff affixed his seal. According to the agreement, he did not owe the plaintiff any money; the plaintiff should owe him 679 yuan. Cao claimed that he worked at Huili Company, and the company had wheat. The plaintiff was unwilling to trade with Japanese merchants, so he acted as an intermediary to order from Japanese merchants. When asked why there were no witnesses on the settlement agreement, Cao replied that it was because he was momentarily unavailable. The plaintiff stated that the wheat contract was dated March 24th of last year, was written on two pages, had witnesses, and had seals over the seams. Now, the defendant's settlement agreement has neither witnesses nor seals over the seams, clearly indicating forgery. At this point, the court ordered the record to be played on a phonograph, and the plaintiff's lawyer listened to the conversations from both sides over the phone. The court then ordered the record to be filed. The defendant's father claimed that the plaintiff recorded the conversations on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of May, when the defendant was not in Shanghai but was in Pudong on business. Both sides requested the court to appoint someone to authenticate the accents on the recording. The court then adjourned the hearing to 8 AM on the 19th and released the defendant on a 1,000 yuan bail.

### Lawyer Assaults Tenant: Defendant Fails to Appear: Plaintiff Ordered to Verify Injuries and Await Review

Wu Xiquan, a lawyer residing at No. 5, Huayuan Village, Route Lugan, had a four-story apartment. On the 11th of last month, he rented a room to Zhu Jingci, a Nantong native who worked at the Dasheng Cotton Mill, for a monthly rent of 55 yuan. Zhu moved in and paid two months' rent of 110 yuan. On the 4th of this month, Wu suddenly ordered Zhu to move out by the 5th. Zhu replied that he needed to stay until the end of the month, leading to a verbal altercation. At 10 PM on the night of the 4th, Zhu returned home from outside, and Wu assaulted and injured Zhu, causing his nose to bleed and his right forehead to bruise. Zhu reported the incident to the French police, who dispatched detectives to investigate and summoned both parties to the police station for investigation. Yesterday morning, they were sent to Criminal Division 8 of the Special No. 2 Court for questioning. The defendant Wu Xiquan failed to appear. Only the plaintiff, Zhu Jingci, appeared and briefly described the assault. Judge Qiu adjourned the hearing and ordered the defendant to be summoned again on the 3rd for questioning and verification and ordered the plaintiff to verify his injuries.

### Adopted Son Indulges in Debauchery: Embezzles Money and Flees, Arrested

A Jiangbei woman, Xiao Yiniang, used to run a flower and cigarette shop in Xiaodongmen and had some savings. Lacking an heir, she adopted an orphan named Amao, now 20 years old, who only associated with hooligans and did not engage in legitimate business. She also arranged for a girl from the same village, Xiaomei, to be his adopted wife. After the mother completed the wedding ceremony for her son, Amao devoted himself to wandering and quarreled with his wife. His wife contracted tuberculosis and died a few months ago. A few days ago, Amao took advantage of his mother's absence and embezzled all of her jewelry, such as five gold bracelets, a gold chain, pearl hairpins, pearl circles, and rings, and fled. He either pawned or sold the items, opened a large hotel, and spent every day dancing in various dance halls. After discovering the loss of the items the next day, she reported the case to the French police for investigation. The police chief immediately dispatched detectives to investigate and arrested Amao at a dance hall last night. He was taken to the police station, where he confessed to stealing the items. He claimed that after running out of money, he had spent most of it gambling or in dance halls. In addition to recovering part of the stolen goods, his mother has been summoned to the court today for questioning.

### Possession of Pistol Bullets: Committing the Crime of Endangering Public Safety: Two Offenders Found Not to Have Committed a Crime, Sentenced and Given Probation: Confiscation of Guns and Ammunition, Women Released Without Charge

Ji Cunyi, head of the Chinese detectives at the Lao Zha Police Station, along with detective Li Pengfei, searched the Zhongzhou Hotel at No. 4, Lane 27, Shandong Road, at 9 PM on the second of the month. Two pistols and three bullets were found in Room 212, and seven suspects, including Hu Zhiyuan, Zhang Wuwei, Xia Zhenya, Yu Zhongyue, and women Xu Huifang, Xu Meizhen, and Jin Lingbao, were arrested and sent to the Special No. 1 Court.

After being detained for questioning, Judge Xiao Xieffen of Criminal Division 1 held a continued hearing yesterday morning. According to the police lawyer Ru Baoyi, during the adjournment, it was found that the defendants had not committed any crimes within the concession. Therefore, they were prosecuted for the crime of endangering public safety and requested to be punished according to law. Hu Zhiyuan confessed that he borrowed the pistol from Yu Zhongyue to use it to join a certain organization. Yu Zhongyue confessed that when Hu came to borrow the gun, he said that because some unconscionable merchants in Shanghai were collecting copper coins in large quantities for outflow, causing panic in the market, he intended to give them a warning. That's why he lent the gun to him, and so on. The other defendants all claimed that they were just visiting Hu Zhiyuan's room and had no knowledge of the private possession of military weapons. After verifying the statements, Xiao sentenced Hu Zhiyuan and Yu Zhongyue to six months imprisonment each, with a three-year probation. The pistols and ammunition were confiscated. Zhang Yingwei, Xia Zhenya, Sun Huifang, Xu Meizhen, and Jin Lingbao were all found not guilty.

Commentary

### Indeed, the so-called "Theory of Chinese Medical Art" (Part 1)

— Song Daren

A few years ago, the theory of Qi transformation in Chinese medicine and the theory of philosophy in Chinese medicine were also popular for a while; but soon they were severely refuted by the new medical community and the scientific community, their fallacies were exposed, and they disappeared without a trace. Since the war, medical forums have been silent for a long time; people in society have also been unable to pay attention to it. Recently, I saw an article entitled "Theory of Chinese Medical Art" by Mr. Zhang Feng, published in this journal, followed by Mr. Ding Jinan's speech (North China Star Daily, October 20, 1938) in response, which is like a new thorn in the medical community, especially today when the standards for establishing Chinese medicine schools are being promulgated and implemented, it is even more worthy of attention. Mr. Zhang has served as a university teacher for many years, is knowledgeable and famous, and is in a position to lead young people. His academic thoughts are sufficient to influence social opinion; Now when I look at the argument of his full text, it involves ambiguity and vagueness, and there is no clear definition, which does not seem to be the attitude that a scholar should take. I dare not be humble and point out the mistakes in the original texts of the two gentlemen, and I am willing to discuss them with my colleagues and those who care about them.

What is the Art of Chinese Medicine?

To talk about the "Art of Chinese Medicine," we must first talk about the definition of art; art has a broad sense and a narrow sense. In a broad sense: all activities and productions that contain skills and considerations—such as mechanical craftsmen building houses—are called art—that is, the meaning of technology. As for art in the narrow sense, it refers to the activities of beautiful value, or the products of its activities, the meaning is the same as Fineart. Since the definition of art has been clarified, then the establishment of the "Theory of Art" can be criticized!

Mr. Zhang said: "Chinese medicine is art." This question is not Mr. Ding Jinan's original solution. It was also discussed in Liang Shuming's book "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies"; now I will first transcribe Liang's views below.

"...Although we can also make iron, steel, gunpowder,...and all kinds of manufacturing projects rely on the "skills" passed down from the craftsmen's hearts, the West must rely on science—using a method to organize many fragmented experiences and incomplete knowledge into learning, and explore forward. Industry is like this with "skills", agriculture is also like this,...it is absolutely not done by personal wisdom,...in fact, it is still skills. Western medicine prescriptions, certain diseases, certain medicines, no big difference; and the masters of Chinese medicine, their talents and skills are all in prescribing medicines. Ten doctors have ten different prescriptions, and they can be very different. Because the diseases treated and the medicines that can be treated are not objective. What is the disease? Where is the "sick"? There is no need to test it, just observe the disease situation from an empty perspective. (There is no mention of "disease" in Chinese medical books) What is the composition of a certain medicine? What is its effect? Don't ask, just use warm and cool words to evaluate it. The opinions are very different about whether it is warm or cool. How can his diagnosis and medication not be different for ten people? This kind of spirit that requires a certain objective and universally recognized knowledge is the spirit of science. This kind of spirit that completely despises objective standards and rules and specializes in worshiping genius is the spirit of art...." ——Chapter 2, page 26 of "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies."

"...Science seeks universal rules and principles, which everyone recognizes and verifies; therefore, what the predecessors had, the present people have, and what is valuable is the new invention, and step by step, step by step, of course, the present is better than the ancient. Art lies in the genius and secret skills, which are uniquely obtained by individuals. Later generations often feel that they can't catch up with the achievements of the predecessors. What is valuable is the secret recipe passed down from ancestors, and naturally they sigh that the present is not as good as the ancient. Since it is passed down from the master and disciples, the result will inevitably be divided into schools, and no common standard can be established in academics. The first step is not solid, how can the second step move forward, and even the things passed down from the master and disciples sometimes will be lost, and the present is not as good as the ancient is also an inevitable fact...."

——Chapter 2, pages 26-27 of "Eastern and Western Cultures and Their Philosophies"

In fact, what Mr. Liang called art is the meaning of technical skill, and does not have a very beautiful meaning and value, and does not refer to "fine art" in the narrow sense. Moreover, it is a mixed statement, and it does not specifically refer to Chinese medicine. Mr. Liang has already stated that Chinese medicine is not "learning." Now, looking at Mr. Ding Jinan's original text, it is indeed derived from Mr. Liang, but the latter part of the original text suddenly says "Chinese medicine is art," probably thinking that this would be very moving to hear. However, medicine is certainly not "fine art" but "science." Mr. Ding also knows this, but insists on saying that it is art. I really don't understand, what is glorious about saying that Chinese medicine is art—skills—? It really cannot get rid of the common problem of not being able to distinguish the different paths of "learning" and "skills"; in short, "Chinese medicine" and "Chinese medical science" are absolutely different. "Chinese medicine" is a "person," "Chinese medical science" is a paper full of absurd words, so "Chinese medical art" is not equal to "Chinese medical science art," and should never be confused. Mr. Zhang even regards it as a narrow art that is "full of fun, emotional, and attractive"—fine art—and wants to combine the two nouns of "Chinese medical science" and "art" to create something called "Theory of Chinese Medical Art," wanting to "make the absolute medical science theorists hesitate," it is not only a joke, but also a bit close to nonsense. The argument is already wrong, and naturally the deduction and citations are all wrong. (To be continued)

### A Brief Discussion of "Vitamins" in Cod Liver Oil

— Zheng Jingren

Cod liver oil is the fat oil from the fresh livers of fish of the Gadidae family, Gadus Murrhua Linne, and G. Macrocephalus Tilesins, POlloachius brandi, Jordan et Snylea, etc., which is obtained after removing impurities by chemical methods. It is a golden yellow, clear oil liquid. This product has always been regarded as a medicine, but in recent years, it has been regarded as a general public nutrient. The main components of this product are vitamins A and D (Vitamin A. C10H30O, Vitamin D. C28H44O). Vitamin A is the most abundant in cod liver oil, followed by vitamin D. According to the United States Pharmacopoeia (U.S.P.), each cubic centimeter of cod liver oil should contain at least 600 international units of vitamin A and at least 85 international units of vitamin D. Vitamins have great medicinal value and are described as follows:

(A) Vitamin A can treat keratomalacia, developmental disorders in children, malnutrition, liver disease, hypoacidity, etc., and can also be used externally to treat trauma.

(B) Vitamin D can treat rickets in children, chondromalacia, infantile convulsions, tetany, etc., and can also be used as an adjunct to calcium treatment.

From the above-mentioned functions, it can be seen that cod liver oil is indeed an indispensable substance for our daily health care, especially for children. Cod species containing cod liver oil are produced along the coasts of Europe and America, with Norway and Denmark producing the most. Our country's coastal provinces do not produce this kind of fish, so the cod liver oil used in our country's medical treatment must be imported.

Although cod liver oil has great benefits for us, it has a special odor that is unpalatable and easy to induce nausea. However, with the progress of modern science, pharmaceutical chemists have been able to use chemical methods to extract or concentrate vitamins A and D from cod liver oil and make them into other preparations that are delicious and easy to take, and their effectiveness is even greater than that of the original oil. Therefore, the clear cod liver oil sold on the market (Cod Liver Oil) often contains effective ingredients vitamins A and D that have been extracted. If we take this kind of cod liver oil, there is no effect at all, and it is a waste of money and a delay in health. Therefore, when cod liver oil is imported from foreign countries, the selling pharmacy should first inspect it and then sell it according to the results. Otherwise, if it is sold without inspection, it will be a loss of business ethics and credit. Hereby, the inspection methods of cod liver oil are recorded below; as for the biological potency test of vitamins in cod liver oil (Biological Potency Test), because it cannot be completed in a short period of time and cannot be carried out in a general laboratory, it is omitted and will be described in detail in another article.

The general simple inspection method of cod liver oil is as follows:

(1) The specific gravity of this product at 25oC should be O, 918-O, 927.

(2) The acid value of this product should not exceed 2.5.

(3) The unsaponifiable value of this product should not exceed 1.5%.

(4) The saponification value of this product should be 163-190

(5) The iodine value of this product is 140.180

(6) Dissolve one drop of this product in twenty drops of chloroform, then add one drop of sulfuric acid, shake, and it will turn reddish-purple, quickly turn rose-red, and finally become brownish-yellow.

(7) Place ten to fifteen drops of this product on a watch glass, then add two or three drops of fuming sulphuric acid. After placing it, it will turn red. After stirring with a glass rod, it will turn rose-red and finally become lemon yellow (if it is another type of oil, there will be no such pigment change, or it will first become yellow or blue, etc.).

(8) In 1925, Rosenhein and Drummond discovered the pigment reaction for testing vitamin A. After adding Arsenic Trichloride test Solution to cod liver oil, it turned a bright blue. However, after further research by Carr and Price, they believed that using Antimony Trichloride dissolved in chloroform as a test solution, the reaction produced was even more sensitive than using arsenic trichloride solution.

Common Sense of Treatment

### Observations on the Treatment of Pneumonia (Continued from Issue 23)

— Gu Buwen

After Serum Therapy

Mortality Rate Reduced by Fifty Percent

The original concept of Antipneumonia Serum originated in 1897, but it was not fully effective until 1909. Later, Neufeld and Handel cooperated to create a polyvalent serum, achieving satisfactory results. This led to the recognition that a type of diplococcus is the main cause of pneumonia, harboring malice, accumulating viruses, and lurking within diverse serotypes (like clusters of Lupine flowers in a garden).

Antitoxic serum, made from a mixture of various serotypes, is called "polyvalent serum." However, before the discovery of polyvalent serum in 1924, Felton created a highly concentrated serum. Unfortunately, due to improper use, it repeatedly failed, and its reputation did not spread.

However, the efficacy of antitoxic serum only extends to the same serotype of pneumococcus, so it has little effect on other serotypes. For example, for the most common Type 1 and Type 2, if Type 2 serum is used for Type 1 infections, it will be completely ineffective. If polyvalent serum is used indiscriminately, regardless of serotype, its efficacy will only reach a part of the infection, ultimately failing to achieve widespread effectiveness, leading to poor results.

Because of this characteristic, antitoxic serum is only suitable for confirmed serotypes of pneumococcus, enabling the control of infection and reliable efficacy. Therefore, it is imperative to use the correct serum to be legitimate. At the same time, upon the initial admission of patients to the hospital, it is essential to examine the bacteria in their sputum.

The earlier serum is used, the better; otherwise, later diagnoses may result in missed treatment opportunities. To avoid delays, if the serotype of the bacteria is not examined and polyvalent preparations are injected rashly, hoping for rapid results, even with large amounts of serum, the achieved efficacy will be very thin, and the outcome will inevitably be failure. Unless the key points of the specific serotype are discovered, it will be difficult to recover the lost value of serum therapy.

Most pneumonias involve Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 serotypes, and each serotype serum can be quickly effective for its respective Type. However, in reality, it is not so simple, because there are as many as thirty Types of pneumococcus, and specific serotype serums are now available for each serotype. However, the differentiation of serotypes has become a matter of consideration. Fortunately, 60 percent are Type 1, Type 2, or their mixed serotypes. But in the event of other Types, accurate identification must be made to complete serum therapy.

Since Neufeld and Sabin created a rapid and simple serotyping method, significant progress has been made. This serotyping test allows even less experienced testers to determine the serotype of pneumonia within minutes. Therefore, early diagnosis is completed reliably, and rapid specific efficacy is self-evident. Thus, the opportunity for successful treatment is greatly increased, making it the most significant advance in medicine.

Pneumonia's diplococcus is usually hidden within a dense capsule, making it difficult to detect even with a microscope. Adding a specific serotype of antitoxic serum to a drop of sputum containing pneumococcus causes a typical change within this capsule, causing the bacteria to swell and develop, creating a diffractive phenomenon resembling frosted glass.

This Quelluug phenomenon is medically significant, and its test is very precise, so the results obtained are foolproof. Therefore, the efficacy of specific serum therapy is based on the Type of this bacterium, resulting in excellent outcomes. (To be continued)

Old News Newly Transcribed Sixty-Seven Years Ago (86)

(From this Newspaper, July of the 11th year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty)

### American Consul Arrests Li Zhenda

When the Easterners (Japanese) mobilized troops to conquer the Taiwanese aborigines, the envoys of various Western countries stationed in the East, knowing that China had not given permission, which violated international law, all issued notices to merchants, forbidding them from renting ships to the Easterners or serving in their military. Although the order was issued, the American people were still unable to comply. Therefore, an American named Li Zhenda, employed by the Easterners, was arrested by the American consul when passing through Xiamen and immediately detained. Li Zhenda was originally a general in the United States and later served as a consul in Xiamen. During his leisure time, he traveled extensively to various islands in Taiwan, so he had a thorough understanding of the island's terrain. After retiring and returning to his country, he passed through the East. At that time, the Eastern court was discussing the massacre of Ryukyu refugees by Taiwanese aborigines. Hearing that Li Zhenda knew the details of the island, they immediately consulted him. Li Zhenda presented the map he had drawn and detailed the advantages and disadvantages of Taiwan. Therefore, the Eastern court appointed him as a consulting minister. In the campaign in Taiwan, many matters were directed by him. The day after his arrest, the American consul held a court hearing and asked Li Zhenda: "You have incited the Easterners to break peace with China and advised them to invade Taiwan. Besides the Chinese official's note, there is other evidence to rely on. The land of the Taiwanese aborigines belongs to China, so this matter harms the friendly alliance between the United States and China. Now, you will be detained pending the approval of the American envoy stationed in Beijing, and a decision will be made. When you are detained, you will be treated with courtesy." Li Zhenda argued: "I was chosen and employed by the Eastern court to handle affairs in Taiwan with peaceful intentions, but I was arrested by your consul, which is a great injustice! It is also disrespectful to the peaceful nation of the East." Several days later, the Xiamen consul escorted Li Zhenda to Shanghai. Li hired a lawyer to argue that his arrest was illegal. The American Consul-General in Shanghai cited a regulation established by the American Congress in 1860, which allows envoys to Siam, China, and Eastern countries to arrest subjects who aid an ally of the United States or the internal citizens of that country in battle. However, considering that Li was hired before the war, he was released on bail.

### Rambling on Emotional Contagion

Ding Di

Striking the key that touches the heartstrings, causing a reader to curse, rejoice, smile, and weep along with you, you often set up an emotional collar, putting it around the necks of many people, letting them experience the atmosphere under your pen, your soul, your mood. You paint that atmosphere thick and thick, thicker, more joyful, and more sorrowful than your own, just like the exaggeration of lying. You inaccurately transform emotions specifically for the reader. To arouse the flames of anger and the caress of light and justice, the motivation for emotional exaggeration is naturally good, but the ineffective result is obvious.

When depicting an idea, a set of emotions, a flash of intuition, transforming them into words on paper, there is undoubtedly an atmosphere. "Red Bean" and "Blue Wutong" are brilliant atmospheres; "When will the sun perish? I will die with you!" is an atmosphere of cursing; "Jade dew withers the maple forest" is a desolate atmosphere. When you write down everything you feel, there is naturally your own special atmosphere. Whether this atmosphere is thick or thin, you should write it as it is, write down your curses, your joy, but do not curse or rejoice even more, letting the words overflow your emotions. (Rather than processing the written symbols, cultivate the essence of emotions.)

Naturally, there are also difficulties in exaggeration. It is especially true now that a literary worker, in order to complete a sacred task, arouse hatred, and encourage the pursuit of light, will therefore overconsider the effect. Not only writing down the emotions they feel themselves, but also writing down emotions beyond their feelings. Thus, the problem arises. Conveying what one cannot feel to others, excessive rendering of words, and fabricated atmospheres, can they disguise real emotions? I can answer this question frankly: No! Tolstoy told us in "What is Art?": "Art is a human activity consisting in this, that one man consciously, by means of certain external signs, hands on to others feelings he has lived through, and that other people are infected by these feelings and also experience them." The reason is very clear. To infect others, one must first have considerable emotions oneself, just as you can only sell goods to others if you have them. Anything beyond what you feel is words, not real emotions. If you haven't been moved yourself, how can others be moved.

Truly moving works are determined by the author's emotions. The author's personal experience of the environment, joy or sorrow, tears or smiles, rich emotions constitute a thick atmosphere. Even when written into words, this is not yet words, this is real emotion. Without any exaggeration, this emotion can strike the key that touches the heartstrings.

Nietzsche said, "The noblest beauty is that which does not come suddenly, does not make an intense anaesthetic stimulation." The so-called "anaesthetic stimulation" is a kind of forced infection, rather than the author's gradual influence. Only those with little life experience and careless flippancy lack emotion. Only these people specialize in writing superficial, clamorous, and unrealistic rants and moans, but I oppose that kind of intentionally exaggerated "verbal scream."

The reason for exaggeration is often to thicken the atmosphere of emotions, but this atmosphere is not real emotion, it is a combination of square characters. The smart way is to first train your own emotions, make your feelings run free, your consciousness correct, and your life experience rich. Then your emotions will naturally be disciplined. You don't have to exaggerate, just write down what you feel, calmly and honestly, it's already enough. You don't have to force it, people will naturally feel it. And there is no need for a "sudden attack," but the result is like the attraction of a magnet. This scream is of the "emotion" type, not the "word" type.

I do not oppose articles full of intense love and hate. But this atmosphere must first be experienced by the author. If not, then you must first train your own emotions. Otherwise, your heart may be well-intentioned, but the matter is useless.

### Before Enlisting

— Zhang Zhenshan

— Snippets of a Conscript's Life

After drawing lots, everyone gradually exited the square. The surroundings were peaceful, quiet, as if breathing had stopped; the sun climbed to the top of the sky without a breeze, only occasional cicada sounds, dragging long tunes, horizontally passing over, dividing the deep loneliness.

Under heavy shade, eight hundred conscripts who had drawn lots sat around, quietly waiting for the time to enlist.

"It's only 12:15? How time makes fools of us!" someone said, raising his watch. He stood up impatiently, looking at the sky and the distant valleys.

"I wish I could fly to the front line immediately, fly beyond the mountains, and cut away in a frenzy! Release the accumulated hatred in my heart from the rapid current of fresh blood; then, carrying glorious spoils of war, slowly walk back."

"What's the rush? The time is not far off! There will always be a day to realize it."

"Yes, all the stains on the land will eventually be washed clean!"

"You are an artist, I believe that you will use artistic methods in the future, which will certainly be superior to our hard slashing..."

Several other people stood up again, walking a few steps proudly, clenching their fists.

Looking at the watch, it was only half an hour before enlistment.

On the small road, figures were floating in the distance, in twos and threes, continuously walking over from the foot of the mountain.

They were old men, old women, young women, and children. How lively it was, bursts of laughter following and flying over. They were the families of the conscripts who had drawn lots, who had come specifically to say goodbye. Several conscripts rushed forward, shaking hands and saying happily, "I drew a lot, and I'm enlisting at two o'clock this afternoon."

They hugged each other and gathered into a large pile: laughing wildly, shouting, talking loudly, cheering...

An old gentleman with long, silver-like whiskers, lifted them and said to one who was laughing, "Child: you drew a lot, that's really lucky, you've gotten the opportunity to serve the country, I'm also happy for you! I hope you strive forward."

A beautiful young woman, standing beside her husband, whispered, "First there is a country, and then there is a home. Go ahead, don't be reluctant! When the day of victory comes, I will welcome you under the triumphal arch, singing a song you love to hear."

"If I get injured, I hope to be a wounded soldier under your care," the conscript joked to his wife.

There was also a child, waving his hand, stretching out his neck: "Dad: don't forget to bring back a pony."

Da da di da... The bugle call from the distant command platform suddenly slid across the sky; the noisy square suddenly became quiet again. Whistles sounded nervously, wave after wave, and the conscripts quickly gathered together, instantly arranged into a long snake.

The drill instructor ran over, began inspecting, followed by a speech, he said: "You are about to start working now. I hope you will work hard and be responsible, use your wisdom and strength to seek harvest! Your achievements are not only your own merits, but also the great glory of the local area. Therefore, from today until we part, I hope every day..."

Then, the × commander came to inspect: melting into an iron stream, unfolding.

As they rounded the field for a week, the starting bugle call broke through the sky again, the battalion adjutant blew the whistle, stepping beside the team, advancing towards the designated broken temple.

### High Monk

— Bing Fu

In a dilapidated old temple, there lives a high monk: he seems to live sweetly for the sake of the heavy sound of the wooden fish, pacing the path of life calmly and elegantly, without tears or laughter: all things are like passing smoke and clouds, nothing can disturb his peace of mind!

Who understands him? Who envies him? However, he does not wait for people's understanding, let alone people's envy. Time flies by, trees add years, and the monk adds white hair!

White hair is the mark of his accomplishments, gradually growing from every beat of the wooden fish. His intention is nothing more than to pour his life slantingly from the living end into the other end of stillness, so that he is not suddenly severed, but slowly traverses the rugged mountains like a flowing spring, merging into the boundless sea, and in the process, he does not want to become a waterfall leaping thousands of feet, nor does he want to become a rushing torrent. In this way, he will move from life to death without a trace. Death is his destination!

I understand him, and I envy him, but I hope even more that he can understand me, like me - and countless others like me in the world, will not be converted by his deeds! This is not to say that I am "unrelated", "fate" can be arbitrarily decided by subjectivity. The significant point of difference is that we love life and hate death! And even when we are happy to "draw the knife and make it quick," the minimum condition is "not to fail our youthful years"!

Judging from the fact that he has never nagged and annoyed people to convert, he is obviously not a vulgar monk who seeks offerings from all directions, but if you examine the merits he has accumulated, from beginning to end it shows that he is an extreme egoist, so the distance between him and the vulgar monks is only a grain of millet! So he can only benefit himself, but not save all beings. It's not that he can't make a "great vow", it's just that his heart is more than his strength, and he's afraid of too much trouble!

I understand him, he is a coward who cannot tolerate even the slightest pain! I also envy him, he can skillfully use the wooden fish as a confidant!

— Written at Sea

On the boundless sea,
I sing a song of enlistment,
Waves are in front of me,
Home is far away,
Masts count the stars,
Silence is the light of the lighthouse,
Seagulls flying up and falling,
Turning their silver bodies,
The battlefield is finally near.

What I lacked before,
Was just a sharp sword,
Now to seek a sharp sword,
I am lodging myself at sea,
Waves rise and fall before my eyes,
The sound of waves is like the call of comrades,
Facing the beacons near and far,
Thinking of having a sharp sword tomorrow,
I just can't stop smiling.

### Red Devil Vasika

— by Maxim Gorky, translated by Di Zhou

She was surrounded by a group of drunkards. --And everything, from the madam, sisters to the cracks in the ceiling, she was more than familiar with.

She spoke in a rough voice, only when the guests touched her did she emit a loud laugh like a strong farmer; laughing with her whole body trembling. Among her sisters, the most stupid and the healthiest was not more fortunate than them, because she was more like a beast than them!

Needless to say, in this family where Vasika managed everything more strictly than anywhere else, the girls' terror and hatred for him deepened. When they got drunk, they couldn't hide this feeling and told the patrons loudly about Vasika, but because the patrons never protected them in front of Vasika, this kind of complaining had no effect. And when they hysterically shouted, Vasika heard it--his fiery face appeared at the door of the living room, saying in a cold, stiff voice:

"Don't mess around!..."

"Executioner! Exile!" the woman yelled, "Why do you beat me into a cripple? Look, sir, that guy beat me so hard with a whip,..." The shouting prostitute was about to tear open her clothes to show others.

At this time, Vasika walked over, grabbed her hand, and spoke in an unchanging tone--this was especially terrible--but he spared her.

"Don't make noise! ...Can't you be quiet? What are you making a fuss about? --You're drunk... You'll see!"

Usually, that's about it, only a few times did Vasika take the woman out of the living room. No matter how many prostitutes were his favorites, none of them earned a tender word from him. He only used her as a woman, choosing whoever he liked, and he would say to her:

"Tonight, come to your room for the night,..." Then he walked into the woman's room for a tryst, not saying a word to the woman, and left after finishing.

"Ah, he's a demon!" That's what the girls always said about him.

Almost all the girls in the brothel where he lived had direct contact, and Ajiusunia could not be spared: in fact, every time he had a relationship with her, he always cruelly ravaged her.

Strong, lazy, she was very sleepy. No matter how noisy it was in the living room, she often fell asleep in public. As soon as she sat down in a corner, she would stop flirting in a moment, her eyes suddenly fixed on some object, quietly putting down her eyelids and closing her eyes. And her large white teeth were exposed, her lower lip hanging down with carefree snoring, causing the guests and sisters to laugh. But laughter still couldn't wake Ajiusunia.

This happened to her often. The madam scolded her harshly, slapping her cheeks, but she always couldn't get rid of the sleeping demon on her. She cried for a while, then fell asleep again.

So Vasika had a chance to perform.

Once, she and a drunken guest fell asleep leaning on a chair, Vasika walked over, secretly grabbed her hand, and dragged her out. (5)

### (2) On Methods of Doing Things (Continued from Yesterday)

— Xie

(5) There are often people who start with good intentions, attributing glory to God, but later change their original purpose because they want to satisfy their own selfish desires, so that all previous efforts are abandoned, which is very unfortunate. We must adhere to the purpose, always attributing glory to God, and not to ourselves. (6) We must not publicize the evil deeds of others. The following is evidence of pure intention: (1) A person with pure intention often puts religious affairs before secular affairs. They value cultivating the mind and practicing the Tao, and despise cultivating the body and seeking fame. They would rather sacrifice than profit. (2) If a person respects God at home as if they were in front of the public, it can be known that their intention is pure. (3) A person who often strives to do good themselves and praises the good deeds of others is evidence of pure intention. The ancient saint Moses hoped that everyone would be a prophet, which shows his spirit of impartiality. (4) They despise the rich and glorious life and are selfish. (5) They respect God in the same way when they are poor. In short, some religious things are done meaningfully, and some are done meaningless, the difference lies entirely in whether the intention is pure or not. For example, almsgiving is originally to relieve the poor, fasting is originally to restrain desires and nourish the mind, prayer is originally to seek the Tao, respect is originally to be humble, and self-restraint is originally for patience, but if it is not out of sincerity. Then, almsgiving is like the Pharisees, equal to wasting, fasting is like Jezebel, you suffer in vain, prayer is like Judas, saying one thing and meaning another, respect is like Ahab, completely hypocritical, and self-restraint is like the martyrdom of heretics, suffering in vain. Desiring external fame without internal sincerity, even if all the limbs are complete, the soul is gone, it is simply a walking corpse, what is there to cherish?

Spring and Autumn

### A Parent's Plea and Suggestion

— Yuan

Two senior primary students' tuition costs a total of 150 yuan per semester, various expenses should be reduced where possible to give more students the opportunity to study.

My entire hometown has been sacrificed under the fire of cannons!  Not a tile above my head to shelter me, not a grain of rice in my stomach to feed me, I had no choice but to flee to this temporary refuge.

I planned that all my meager savings, aside from the rent for a small cubicle, could barely cover ninety months if I economized on everything else, which put my mind somewhat at ease.

But a big problem arose: my children's future cannot be delayed. No matter what, I must send them to school.

I took a look at the prospectuses of several nearby primary schools. The tuition for senior primary school was 20 to 30 yuan, plus miscellaneous fees and book fees. School A was closer, with tuition at 25 yuan, miscellaneous fees at 3 yuan, library fee at 1 yuan, and sports fee at 1 yuan, totaling 30 yuan, with books extra. Fortunately, it was close and I could save on transportation costs. I gritted my teeth and decided to give it a try.

I took my two children to register, paid a registration fee of 4 yuan and an examination fee of 2 yuan. The receipt stated that these fees would not be deducted from the tuition.

They passed the exam. I had to register and reserve a place first. New students had to pay an admission fee of 5 yuan and a school fund of 5 yuan, which also would not be deducted from the tuition. What to do? If you want to study, you need money. Of course, you have to pay!

School started. In addition to paying the tuition, miscellaneous fees, library fee, and sports fee, the school would handle the purchase of books, notebooks, and stationery, with a prepayment of 5 yuan and adjustments made for any overpayment or underpayment. Of course, "all fees must be paid in full before attending classes."

After sending them to school, I finally breathed a sigh of relief. I calculated that I had paid a total of 96 yuan. This was the cost for two students to attend senior primary school for one semester!

A bolt from the blue! The next day, the students came back and reported that the teacher said each student had to pay an additional 3 yuan for uniform fees, 0.5 yuan for badge fees, 0.3 yuan for school newspaper fees, and 0.2 yuan for class dues, adding another 8 yuan for the two of them. Helpless, I had to pay! Pay!

With great difficulty, we got through one month peacefully.

On the first day of the second month, the children brought back a notice: it briefly stated that the school was borrowing classrooms from another school, which was inconvenient. Now, a new location had been found, and classes would be moved to ×× Road starting immediately. Great! Another expense added for transportation and meals!

The semester ended, and I had to pay a 5-yuan reservation fee. I calculated that two senior primary students cost a total of 150 yuan for one semester.

Economically bankrupt and with no income, how could I bear such a large educational expense? Helpless, I had to let them temporarily drop out of school.

Thinking about it, I'm sure there are many others who share my plight, so I sincerely hope that the school authorities will economize on unnecessary expenses as much as possible, reduce fees, alleviate the burden on parents, send more children to school, and achieve the ultimate goal of national education. For example, although the notebooks made by the school are uniform, beautiful, and neat, this inevitably increases costs. A notebook that costs five or six cents outside the school costs one dime inside the school, which is a big difference. Also, like the school newspaper, although there are many benefits, not having it doesn't necessarily cause harm. In these times of high prices, it is not very appropriate. Other fees, such as sports uniforms and handicraft supplies, should also be reduced where possible. Also, the layers upon layers of admission fees and basic fees seem like exorbitant taxes. I hope that the education authorities will seriously consider this and make improvements. Furthermore, I hope they will not use a small number of free slots for rewarding excellent students to attract students, but will instead substantially reduce the fees for all students. It should be known that while excellent students should be rewarded, the more numerous ordinary students, who make up the majority of the population, also need education.

If every school could consider all aspects of society and carefully consider the fees charged and the courses taught, then I believe that education will definitely be popularized, and the nation's future will definitely have hope.

### Biographies of Female Ballad Singers

— Shen You

Ma Rufei and Female Ballad Singing (This section should be placed after section three) (After the first paragraph of the Japanese text)

It can be seen that until the end of the Jiaqing period, female ballad singers were still independent individuals, singing anywhere they pleased, without a fixed location. After the Daoguang period, they gradually gained importance, and there were venues for singing. However, in the early stages, the singers were not the so-called "courtesans"; they were still a group of "blind girls." Ma Rufei's unprinted opening ballad "What is the Most Heartbreaking Thing in the World?" satirizes their lives:

What is the most heartbreaking thing in the world? It's a pity for beautiful women who are blind. It's difficult to string the thread for painting dragons and embroidering phoenixes. It's not clear when boiling tea and cooking rice. They have no part in sightseeing. They can only hear the gongs and drums of the opera. Bright daylight is like cloudy rain. They can't distinguish day from night. No matter how beautiful they are compared to Xi Shi, even if men indulge in pleasure, they have no sympathy. When they grow up, they are married young. They can only learn to sing southern ballads and become female teachers. They sing little tunes on stage in a glib manner. The zither and pipa are their double shields. They wear powder and flowers on their faces. Their clothes are all silk. It's really scary to look at them directly, but romance can only be seen from behind. When they meet a soulmate on the road, they will call him. They can only hear his voice but can't see him. They don't recognize King Xiang's face on the terrace. They must be confused by the rain clouds of Wushan several times. They only call him a "beardless gentleman."

The "female teachers" mentioned here are actually the early "courtesans." The only difference between them and the later "courtesans" is whether they were "blind" or "not blind." Ma Rufei was in Suzhou at that time, and he expressed great dissatisfaction with the emerging "female ballad singers," especially their lives. For the dignity of the storytelling profession, he did not hesitate to launch a strong attack. "What is the Most Heartbreaking Thing in the World?" is one example. However, his opposition was not limited to this. We can also look at another of his printed opening ballads, "Yin Sheng Yang Shuai" (Feminine Dominance, Masculine Decline):

Feminine dominance and masculine decline have been said since ancient times. Government offices collapse, but temples are new. Suzhou's styles change every year. All the storytelling venues use female teachers. No one asks about Yan Zhiyun's three words. Old Niangniang is old and not fashionable. It's a pity that she's crude and unorthodox. The Yao sisters, aunt and sister-in-law, have Yao as their surname and Lan as their names. Zhou Yuan changes her act with a small reputation. Li Cuiyun, Jing Cuiyun, and Gusu Juiyun, the three Cuiyuns rise together. The bright face powder is three parts thick. The pitted surface must be flattened. Xu Shuzhen has faces of all over. The nine-inch head and big feet are really ugly. Walking sounds like wooden clogs. Talented, beautiful, and skilled, Lu Xiuqing is known everywhere. Gentlemen and wealthy households often come and go, entering and leaving the Yamen of Changzhou and Wuxian. Ghost stories are not necessarily true. Fang Qiuchan can play Huizhou Bai, and also has three parts of Changshu accent. Parents-in-law and parents-in-law, children's relatives and children's love. Wang Ruiyun, Ma Xiuying, without talent or beauty, are driven out of the house. Fortunately, we rely on gentry guests, who suffer this bitterness for blind ballad singers and blind teachers. There is nowhere to complain, so close your eyes.

In "What is the Most Heartbreaking Thing in the World?" Ma Rufei only expressed his hatred for female ballad singers, which is not of much value. But "Yin Sheng Yang Shuai" is different. It not only points out the beginning of the prosperity of female ballad singers in Suzhou, but also allows us to know the figures of early Suzhou female ballad singers. If it weren't for Rufei's opening ballad, we might never have known about these figures. "Yin Sheng Yang Shuai" can be compared with Rufei's unprinted embedded name opening ballad "Fang Qiuchan's Soul":

Fang Qiuchan's soul illuminates the sorrowful people. Tears fall one after another on the silk quilt. Zhang Yufeng is spread on the tooth bed. She leisurely plays the Yaoqin outside the railing. Two wild geese, Xu Yue'e, furrow her brows. Her emaciated face is lightly ill. Lying horizontally with her clothes on, the clouds are messy. Her gestures and demeanor evoke a sense of rain. Thinking that she was born to weave scenes in the clouds, she cannot see the Cowherd riding on colored clouds. She manages colored clouds without incident, and she begs for skill by ordering the moon iron according to tradition. Looking at the Milky Way, the Zhang and Kui stars appear, and a wisp of jade incense rises. A Yao heart and orchid quality are sorrowful and ill. Why is she furrowing her brows and clutching her heart? Separating from Lang Zhou has been really long. It has harmed my spirit. The dragon horse is slender and graceful. The joyful scene of the colorful clouds is easily scattered (to be continued) (6)

### The Self-Renewal Movement

— Zhang Zhenshan

Can the 14 Provisions on Thrift Be Achieved? Can the Following Five Articles on Eliminating Addictions Be Achieved?

In all provinces and cities across the country, even in remote rural areas, people are living simple wartime lives to save material resources for proper use. Only Shanghai seems to be an exception. It is filled with a prosperous atmosphere of singing and dancing everywhere. The general public is immersed in a luxurious, decadent, and lazy life of pleasure, which has not diminished to this day. How regrettable it is that these useful human and material resources are being wasted in that vortex? In the past, there were "Thrift Movement" and "Ten No's Movement," which achieved considerable success. Now, the United Christian Student Associations have launched a "Self-Renewal Movement."

In principle, true Christians have an absolutely firm spirit of belief and obedience to religious rules and other rules. For example, they always adhere to small matters such as not smoking or drinking. Therefore, movements initiated by religious groups individually are more effective than social organizations or publicity that correct bad habits with a general and universal target audience.

Although the current "Self-Renewal Movement" targets students, the "Rebirth Goals" it has established are more active and substantial than the regulations of previous movements. Regarding thrift, there are fourteen articles: (1) I establish and strictly implement a personal budget system and develop the habit of keeping daily accounts; (2) I will not make new clothes, and when I must make them, I will not make expensive and luxurious ones; (3) I will not have the idea of disliking the old and liking the new for daily necessities; (4) I will use less cosmetics, not wear silk stockings, and not perm my hair; (5) I will not use fancy envelopes and stationery for writing letters; (6) I will reduce eating snacks; (7) I will not travel first class; (8) I will take fewer photos when visiting parks; (9) I will not hold frequent dinners… (10) I will reduce spending during festivals; (11) I will practice thrift in my life and donate the money I save each month to the country and those who are suffering; (12) I will do my best to serve student groups or social charity and educational work; (13) I will not trouble others with my own affairs; (14) I will pay attention to the lives of the masses, and I will have more opportunities to approach them, understand them, and help them.

Regarding eliminating addictions, there are also five articles: (1) Proper entertainment is the vitamin of life. I will use sports, music, chess, painting, writing, and other hobbies, as well as group life, to replace improper entertainment; (2) I will reduce the number of movies I watch… (3) I will not go to entertainment venues that are unconscious or of low taste; (4) I will not gamble or play mahjong; (5) I will not smoke or drink.

Although the above regulations cannot be said to be perfect, the effect they can produce can be said to make every penny not go to useless places, and make every person not be a parasite of the country and society. Concentrating human and material resources on the welfare of the country and society is beneficial to the country and society on the one hand, and indirectly brings blessings to oneself on the other hand. To put it more plainly: correcting bad habits and developing a spirit of hard work can cope with more difficult living environments; saving all extravagant and wasteful money can be used to relieve the suffering of refugees or to support one's own life in the future. At present, being addicted to improper enjoyment cannot be said to definitely lead to depravity, but at least it hinders a person's progressive thoughts and actions. Therefore, it is indeed necessary to practice thrift. The group that initiated the "Rebirth Goals" hopes that the academic community in various provinces and cities will respond and fulfill them. However, non-academics may also automatically fulfill them and further seek possible expansion of the scope.

### The Raw Materials and Origin of Rainproof Straw Hats

— Runzi

Anything that can serve two purposes is, of course, most popular. For example, six or seven years ago, a kind of rainproof cloth was popular. It was said that ordinary native factory woolen cloth was soaked in some kind of chemical raw material and then taken out, it would have the effect of resisting dampness and rain. However, the essence of the cloth would not show any traces. So, on a sunny day, it could be worn as a long robe; in rainy weather, it could be used as a raincoat. Recently, a kind of rainproof straw hat has suddenly become popular on the market, just like the rainproof cloth a few years ago. The owners seem to know that customers have some doubts, so in order to prove their honesty and trustworthiness, they put the rainproof straw hats in a water tank in the display window for people to see, showing that it does have the rainproof effect of not changing when it gets wet. As a result, some friends who have worn Panama, Little Luzon, and straw hats that go out of shape when it rains cannot resist the smoke screen propaganda of these "rainproof" hats and switch to these rainproof straw hats of unknown origin.

Friends who don't know what the raw materials of rainproof straw hats are made of may suspect that these rainproof straw hats are made of rubber because of the publicity of the word "rainproof," or that they are made of some kind of chemical substance. In fact, to reveal the secret, the raw material of rainproof straw hats is paper. However, what is shipped to our country is semi-finished product. As long as a thin layer of spray paint is added, the so-called rainproof straw hat is successfully made. Therefore, the ones sold by Merchant A are crowned with the brand of Merchant A; the ones sold by Merchant B are crowned with the name of Merchant B. People who don't know the inside story always think that it is a completely domestic product, but who knows that its origin is so vague! Even if we take a step back and put aside emotions, and only talk about economic conditions: since it is a thing made of paper, no matter how beautiful its appearance is, it can be asserted that it will not be durable. As for the rainproof problem, how long can it last with only a thin layer of spray paint? Naturally, it becomes a question again. What's more, if the spray paint has been on for a long time, it will fall off. At that time, it will be mottled. I am afraid that not only will it not be able to prevent rain, but it will also be a little embarrassing to use it to block the sun.

### A General Review of Hou Yulan (Part 1)

— Meihua Pavilion Master

Absolutely No Doubt She Will Become Popular

Hou Yulan, 19 years old, is from Beiping. She loved drama from a young age. At the age of fifteen, she was admitted to the China Senior Opera Vocational School. At that time, Zhao Jinrong was the most popular student in the school who practiced Qingyi, and her reputation spread throughout the north and south. Yulan's family was poor. Her mother, Mrs. Wen, supported herself by needlework. Yulan hoped to acquire a skill to support her mother, so she studied diligently and worked hard to improve herself.

My friend Mr. Jin Zhongsun (Zhao Yan, hao Huilu) took over the management of the opera school. Whenever famous actors performed, he would send students to observe and imitate. Hou Yulan followed Cheng (Yanqiu), Wang Jinlu followed Yang (Xiaolou), Wang Helin followed Ma (Yunliang), Li Yuru followed Xun (Huisheng)... all because of this. (The opera school focused on group performances and did not promote individuals, so there were many talented people, but few people in Shanghai knew about them. However, Song Dezhu has been deeply known to the people of Shanghai through the introduction of the Half-Month Drama.) Yulan admired Yu Shuang and watched every performance. She paid attention to every aspect of Cheng's singing, acting, reciting, fighting, hand movements, eye movements, body movements, and footwork. After class, she recited it in her mouth and thought about it in her heart, studying and practicing it. Yu Shuang also often gave guidance, so she was able to become a successful Cheng-style talent.

Yulan's singing style followed Cheng's and she grasped the essence of it. A recording company admired her talent and once paid her a lot of money to record a disc of "Peacock Flies Southeast," which was briefly in circulation and sold very well. Yu Shuang's proud works are all Yulan's forte. The play "Peacock Flies Southeast" was originally one of the four new plays that Yu Shuang planned to arrange and donate to the opera school for public performance. When the public performance of this play was first decided, Zhao Jinrong was first appointed as the protagonist and Wang Yaoqing was the director. Later, Yulan was assigned to star in the play, and Yu Shuang personally gave guidance. Several performances were decided, and all received high praise. Therefore, this play is not only Yulan's representative work, but also one of the opera school's representative works. Since then, female actors in the old capital have all imitated it. Some changed the name to "Zhongqing and Lanzhi," some changed the name to "Jiao Zhongqing," and some changed the name to "Tears of Life and Death." Because the China Opera School has the exclusive performance rights to this play, imitators had to change the name of the play. However, the great power of its magic can also be seen in this.

Yulan's acting style also followed Yu Shuang's. Chen Moxiang said that Yu Shuang's water sleeve skills were unprecedented. Yu Xie praised Yulan's water sleeve skills for being wonderfully natural. Yulan's skills such as running the garden and entering the kiln door are similar to Yu Shuang's, which can be seen in the play "Wujiapo." Yulan's art followed Yu Shuang's, and she also taught morality and studied diligently, which is similar to Yu Shuang's "art advancing to the Tao." Therefore, everyone calls her "Female Yanqiu."

Yulan's favorite plays, in terms of old plays, are Yutangchun, Wang Baochuan, Visiting Mother and Returning Order, Shilian Lamp, Golden Lock Record, Zhuhen Record, Cursing the Palace, Teaching the Son, Meiyu Match, Yanmen Pass, etc. Before graduating, she already had the aura of a master. In terms of new plays, it is unlikely that they will be staged due to the problem of supporting roles. Yulan's appearance is similar to Wan Hua's, and Ling Xiaohan Pavilion calls her "Sai Lanfang" and "Female Lord Hou." There is an article as proof:

I call Hou Yulan "Sai Lanfang," and my friends call her "Female Yanqiu," which is not impossible. The nickname is nothing more than publicity, and success still depends on oneself.

Speaking of this "Female Lord Hou," it was obvious from three or four years ago that she was "an amazing talent." Her appearance is dignified and beautiful, which is enough for people to "see"; her singing is loud and sharp, which is enough for people to "hear." To say that she combines the strengths of Mei and Cheng would be an exaggeration; to say that she is limited to one school or one faction would also be a disservice. She seems to be constantly paying attention to the strengths of her predecessors and using them. This is one of the reasons for Mei and Cheng's success. This is how she is amazing, really amazing!

Random Notes by an Artist

### Trip to the Philippines

— Zhou Xuan

Editor's introduction: Zhou Xuan is currently the only female star of Guohua Company. She showed her talent in her early years when she was engaged in singing and dancing. Four years ago, she began to appear on the screen and acted in many films. Her famous work was Yuan Muzhi's "Street Angel." Her recent works, such as "Meng Jiangnu" and "Li Sanniang," also have unique styles and can give the general audience more goodwill.

I have never traveled far before. After the outbreak of the war, I suddenly traveled thousands of miles to the Philippines.

It was in the winter of the year before last, not long after the Shanghai-Songhu anti-Japanese war line moved west. Someone from the Philippines came to negotiate and invited me to participate in the performance, saying that it was to raise funds for disaster relief. I thought: It's too boring in Shanghai. This is a good opportunity to change the air. At the same time, it is also a suitable opportunity to do what I should do in the drama post. So, I immediately went south with Mr. Yan Hua and them.

This troupe was called "China Kaleidoscope," and it was formed temporarily. In addition to the drama group with me as the protagonist, it also included Peking opera, singing and dancing, and other kinds of entertainment. There were more than 30 members in the entire troupe. We first gathered in Hong Kong, where we made costumes, practiced hard, and stayed for nearly two months before departing.

From Hong Kong to the Philippines, it only takes three days. This place is already in the tropical region. As the large mail ship gradually advanced in the ocean, it became hotter and hotter every day. Because the sea breeze was very strong, it didn't feel too bad. But when we arrived at the port and landed, it was even hotter than the hottest days of summer, almost to the point of "passing out from the heat." Really, going from Hong Kong to here is just like running out of an air-conditioned movie theater into the blazing sun, which is completely different.

Miss Zhou Xuan took a photo in the Philippines wearing local native clothes.

### Zheng Boer Plays "The Blue Bird"

— Hua Zhi

The success of literary works being adapted to the screen has been seen many times. In the past, such as Ms. Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth," and recently such as Mr. Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion," and Ms. Mitchell's "Gone with the Wind," etc., have achieved very good results. Twentieth Century Fox recently decided to start filming the world literary masterpiece "The Blue Bird." This book is a poetic drama by the Belgian modern writer Maurice Maeterlinck. Maeterlinck won the Nobel Prize for Literature for this play. Paramount had previously decided to start filming, but Fox bought the film rights for 35,000 gold pieces. It has been decided that the blue bird's protagonist will be played by the leading box office superstar Shirley Temple. Fox Changju means that Shirley Temple has now entered adolescence and should no longer play children's films, so she will try a literary script. This can be said to be a touchstone for Shirley Temple's acting skills. Whether her style can continue to be appreciated, The Blue Bird is a key to success or failure.

### Anecdotes from the Entertainment Circle

Kun Dan Hua Cuiqin of the Grand World Great Beijing Opera Troupe has been hired by the Tianchan Stage and will join the troupe from the 16th. The troupe will look for other talents. The other day, Kun Dan Chen Yanfang fired a cannon at the daily show, performing the play Yutangchun. If it is successful, she will switch generals with Hua Cuiqin. The seven-book grand drama "Hong Bi Yuan" of the troupe has been rehearsed in detail the night before and the drama photos have been taken.

The Old Third Zhengsunxiang Chaozhou Opera of the Queen's Theater has signed a three-month contract, which will expire on August 16, and will no longer be renewed. Someone is now introducing the Kunji Hongchun Society Tongling Class, which is performing in Nanjing. The owner of the theater, Yang Hongzhi, is still considering it. Someone also intends to rent the theater to perform Yue opera led by Yao Shuijuan, and negotiations are also underway.

The first meeting of the preparatory committee of the Drama Association, which was produced by the Art Friends Dinner, nominated staff, Zhang Yezhier, Dong Tianmin, Hu Hensheng, and Liu Minsheng as the general affairs group, and Zhang Siwei, Liu Yixin, Guan Jian, Wang Daigong, Hu Junan, and Chen Qiufeng as the drama affairs group.

### Unofficial History of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Xu Biyun Violates the Taboo of the Pear Garden White Tiger

Xu Biyun is the fourth son of the famous Xiaosheng Xu Guifang. He and Xu Lanyuan and Xu Binshou are all brothers. At first, he studied Wudan at the Binqing Society presided over by Yu Zhenting. His Wugong skills were extremely skilled. Therefore, after he became famous, he often acted as Lu Wenlong in "Eight Great Hammers." Not only were his skills and spear movements worth watching, but he also had the posture of a Wu Xiaosheng, without the awkwardness of others who occasionally cross-dressed. One reason is because his family's knowledge can be traced back to its origin, and the second is because his foundation was well laid, so his performances can be approved by the audience. There is also another layer. His hard work in jumping in "Green Pearl Falls from the Building" and his sword dance in "Farewell My Concubine" are also difficult for the average famous Dan to achieve now. After leaving the school, he married Lanfang. Seeing the popularity of Mei everywhere, he abandoned his wood profession (Wudan) and asked Mei for advice and changed to learn Mei-style Huashan. At the same time, his uncle Wu Caixia was also a famous Zhengong Qingyi, who loved him very much and often taught him some good tunes. Therefore, his voice and singing were very well-behaved and generous when he first became famous. More than ten years ago, Gaoting Company recorded his "Baolian Lantern" and "Woman Escorting Criminals." That kind of natural singing voice was indeed very rare. Meng Siye (nicknamed Meng Siyouzi), the manager of Ruifuxiang in Beiping, greatly appreciated his art and accepted him as his adopted son. The company is the largest silk, satin and fur shop in the old capital. When it comes to the Meng boss of the Xiang brand, everyone knows it. Since Biyun worshipped this adopted father, not only was there someone to support him, and every performance sold out, but all his newly made costumes were made of the best materials selected from Ruifuxiang. When singing Huashan, the first thing to pay attention to is beautiful costumes. Lanfang has more and newer costumes than anyone else. However, Biyun tried his best to compete with him, desperately adding new clothes, and it was all free, so he was naturally happy to show off. (56)

### Completion of the Chinese Capital Air Combat Film "A Skyful of Ten Thousand Miles"

— Written by Hui Cun

To be transported to various locations for screening in the autumn of this year

Since the August 13th War of Resistance, "China Electric" [Zhong Dian, likely a film studio] had to move from Nanjing to Wuhu, then from Wuhu to Wuhan, and then from Wuhan to Chongqing due to environmental reasons. These three relocations significantly reduced work efficiency, which is a natural reason for the reduced output.

Despite the constraints of the environment, which prevented them from producing as much as they could, all the staff worked diligently to complete films such as "Eastern Battlefield," "Shanghai Frontline," "Active Western Money," "Ninth Month of the War of Resistance," and "Great Battle of Taierzhuang."

After moving to Chongqing, under the leadership of director Luo Xuelian, a new studio was established, the organization was restructured, and talents were widely recruited. In terms of writing and directing, there were Shen Xiling, Xu Suling, He Feiguang, Sun Yu, Pan Zienong, Yu Zhongying, Zhou Ke, and others. The actors included Gao Zhanfei, Bai Yang, Gu Eryi, Wei Heling, Shi Chao, Zhao Dan, Ying Yin, Chen Yiping, Kang Jian, and others.

After the internal adjustments at "China Electric," work was actively resumed. Major films that have been completed include "Bloody Battle in an Isolated City," directed by Xu Suling and starring Bai Yang and others, and "Sons and Daughters of China," written and directed by Shen Xiling and starring Bai Yang, Zhao Dan, Gu Eryi, Wei Heling, Shi Chao, and others. Due to transportation difficulties in the inland areas and limited supplies, the pace of work could not be accelerated. However, every effort was made to ensure the quality of the content, from filming, developing, editing, and organizing to completion. Everything was done with great care.

After the "May Fourth Fire" [likely a specific incident, not the historical May Fourth Movement], the filming work of "China Electric" was affected, and it was even more difficult to start filming outdoor scenes. The air combat film "A Skyful of Ten Thousand Miles," which was originally scheduled to be completed earlier, was temporarily put on hold because there were still two outdoor scenes that had not been filmed. It was not until the Chongqing urban area returned to normal that the filming of outdoor scenes began. As of now, the film has been completely completed. After washing, editing, and organizing, it will be ready to be screened in Chongqing and transported to various locations in the autumn of this year. The film is written and directed by Sun Yu and stars Gao Zhanfei, Bai Yang, and others. It is based on the heroic Air Force, which has repeatedly performed remarkable feats. With the assistance of the Aviation Committee, members of the Air Force who participated in the expeditions to the three islands and bombed Taiwan were specially invited to participate in the performances. There is also a real-life record of our Air Force sinking Japanese warships in the Yangtze River. The greatness and grandeur of the entire film can be imagined.

In addition, films that are still in production include "Mother of the Nation," which is based on the story of Grandma Zhao leading a guerrilla team, "Wandering Children," written and directed by Yu Zhongying, and "Protect Our Homeland," directed by He Feiguang and performed by all the film artists. There are a total of fourteen screenplays and actors that have been booked but have not yet started filming. "China Electric" headquarters expects that these fourteen films will all be completed within the next year.

Recently, the studio has also established a touring screening team. Whenever a new film is produced, it is first brought to various places for screening, so that even people in remote and backward areas can have a glimpse of the great trend of our great War of Resistance. Film's contribution to the promotion of the War of Resistance is indeed of great help.

Game Analysis: We select and publish games by famous players in this column that match the opening setup, so that students can easily refer to them. Chariot 1 moving to 4 against the Chariot is too hasty and does not seem to be the right time. Black's Soldier 9 advancing 1 seems very plain on the surface, but it is actually a key move. If White moves first, Soldier 1 advancing 1 would make it difficult for White's side horse to find a way out for a while. White's Cannon 2 advancing 1 to protect the soldier retains the strength in the later endgame. Black's Chariot 2 retreating 2, although it is a retreat, is a way to advance by retreating, concealing the move Chariot 2 moving to 6 to check, and then 6 advancing 2 to capture both. Soldier 7 advancing 1 is a conservative key move by White. At this time, in the situation of this game, Black has a great ability to attack, and White can only defend for a draw. The reason is that the exchange of chariots was inappropriate. It should not have been exchanged when it was exchanged. It is called an unnecessary move. One move falters, resulting in the loss of counter-attacking power.
