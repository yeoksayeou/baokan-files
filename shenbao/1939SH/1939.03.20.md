Editorial

### The International Situation

For the sake of the civilization and welfare of all mankind, how can a second world war be appropriate? Analyzing it further from an international perspective: China is currently in the midst of resisting aggression and building the nation, progressing on both fronts. Although the world's state of peace or war will inevitably have a double-edged impact on China, the most urgent task is to defend against aggression and seek survival. All efforts and resources are focused on this, so the world's state of peace or war is naturally regarded as a secondary matter and does not evoke a deep sense of interest. Japan has been invading for years, exhausted and at the end of its rope, with a bleak future and unable to stop. Given this abnormal situation, it may have a unique understanding of the world's peace or war and may even fear that the world will not be in chaos. However, while claiming to be sacred and anti-communist, it sits idly by as the Soviet Union auctions off fishing grounds and does not dare to launch a single arrow, retreating in hesitation. This shows that it does not want to expand the war either. As for Britain and France, they used to compromise and yield to pressure, but the appeasement policy has reached its limit, causing them deep pain and leaving them in a dilemma. However, their subjective intention is still to serve as pillars of peace. The Soviet Union advocates socialism in one country and can calmly observe the situation from a distance, unaffected by the great whirlpool. However, the achievements of the successive five-year plans are only meant to ensure that it is not threatened by violent neighbors. It may wait for the opportunity to watch the fire from across the river, believing that its opportunities will be even better after it has grown stronger, but this is not the case at present. The United States of North America is separated by vast oceans and has a significant influence. The government is cautious, and the opposition party still believes that isolation is the best way to win popular support, which is a sign of its aversion to war. Italy is noisy and impulsive, driven by greed, anger, envy, and hatred. It sharpens its knives and tests them once in Abyssinia and again in Spain. However, its so-called aspirations, which are directed at the Mediterranean, only have a colorful impact through indirect means. It does not have the great courage to fulfill its great desires. Its warriors who have penetrated deep into Spain are still controlled by General Franco and have not crossed the red line. Its warmongering is truly limited to Abyssinia. Germany has cleverly seized and annexed territories without bloodshed, dominating the European continent and creating an unapproachable aura. However, its subjective and objective conditions are not yet ready to become the world's hegemon through a single war. Its annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia without war should not be taken as clear evidence of its warmongering. As for other countries, they cannot be decisive factors in victory, nor can they rely on their own strength to ensure their own survival. In the event of a major war, it is not guaranteed that they will not be sacrificed as stray bullets, let alone be able to profit from it. Therefore, they sincerely pray for peace. Based on this analysis, it can be said that every country wants international peace and that every person fears and curses war. However, the dynamic evolution of events has reached a point where there is no longer any basis, whether in theory, belief, method, or strength, to give people a glimmer of hope for peace. It seems that the outbreak of a major war is only a matter of time. Mankind claims to be the most intelligent of all beings, but they kill each other uncontrollably. How pitiful! Only five days have passed since Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, but the human spirit has suddenly changed. What Germany has done demonstrates that: ambition is insatiable and will continue to progress step by step without end, firstly. Treaty promises and vows are equal to waste paper and nonsense and have no value at all, secondly. The appeasement policy is just a fool's dream, thirdly. These three points have not only deceived and betrayed British Prime Minister Chamberlain, French Prime Minister Daladier, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, but have also declared the death sentence of international diplomacy with the atrocities of one country. From now on, all languages and words will become useless objects. International relations will only be maintained in two ways: either tolerating atrocities or resisting atrocities. The United States, Britain, and France can no longer remain tolerant and have issued unwavering rebukes one after another. In addition to protesting, Britain and France have recalled their ambassadors to Germany. Britain has discussed abandoning party differences and forming a national unity cabinet. The French parliament has established an authorization law, granting the government great powers to act as it sees fit. The United States has imposed a punitive tax of 25% on German goods, a disguised trade embargo, and has suddenly taken wartime measures for the manufacture of aircraft and the training of air force personnel. These measures cannot be said to necessarily lead to a major war, but they are undoubtedly signs of the eve of a major war. Moreover, Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia is not enough, and it has made economic demands on Romania, intending to turn the Romanian people into Germany's eternal agricultural slaves. The Romanian government has sought help from Britain, and Poland, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey, and other five countries have expressed their support for Romania as a shield against violence. This is a matter that deserves great attention. Some ethnic Germans living in Eastern and Central Europe have taken the opportunity to demand that their territories be returned to their homeland. It can be seen that Germany's agents are spread everywhere, and any movement can affect the overall situation. This is another matter that deserves great attention. There are rumors that Italy will make demands on France soon. This is another matter that deserves great attention. These three matters are likely to trigger a major war. Every country wants international peace and curses war, as mentioned above, but why is a major war almost imminent? It is the inertia of politics, it is the inertia of mankind. The ambition of ambitious countries is insatiable, they abandon all treaty promises and vows, and they fool the appeasement policy. Germany, Italy, and Japan have been doing this for a long time, not just since the annexation of Czechoslovakia. If they had been contained from the beginning, then maintaining the status quo would have been the inertia. However, they have been tolerated, allowed to act freely, and directly or indirectly rewarded, and as a result, they have become arrogant and extravagant. They have gained more and more, their reliance has grown thicker, and their strength has increased. As a result, they have taken aggressiveness as their inertia, and it is difficult to make them return to a state of rest. Moreover, the "peace first" theory of the past few years has dimmed justice and righteousness, and the weak have been sacrificed. The warmongers have taken aim at peace and flaunted their power and prestige, selling their tactics of coercion and attack. The overall situation is such, and it has a long history. Today, if countries do not resist violence, they can only tolerate it. To effectively resist violence, one must take the initiative to stop it. If the strength is sufficient, one can hope to stop the war with war. If they continue to delay until the disaster is imminent, then they will have gained more, their reliance will have grown thicker, and their strength will have increased. Who will rule the world is unknown.

### Japanese Planes Bomb Xiangfan Again

Over Two Hundred Bombs Dropped, British Missionary in Pingjiang Already Placed in Coffin

Shashi. At around 3:00 PM on the 18th, eight Japanese planes attacked Shashi in two batches, three planes in one batch and five planes in the other. After circling the city twice, they flew into the airspace above Jiangling, dropping 25 bombs, killing and wounding over 50 civilians, and destroying over 50 civilian houses. The American Church of Christ, the Methodist Church, was also hit by three bombs, killing three people. (18th Telegram)

Nanyang. At 9:30 AM on the 18th, 13 Japanese planes entered the airspace above Xuchang in two batches, dropping two or three dozen bombs, destroying dozens of houses. The residents had already evacuated, so there were not many casualties. Yicheng and other places in northern Hubei were also bombed, details to be investigated. (18th Telegram)

Xiangyang. Xiangfan has been bombed by Japanese planes for three consecutive days, especially severely today. At around 12:00 noon, nine Japanese planes, three of which bombed Xiangyang and six of which bombed Fancheng. At 1:30 PM and 3:30 PM, six Japanese planes repeatedly bombed the area in relays, dropping a total of over two hundred bombs. Fortunately, the residents had already been evacuated, so there were only over twenty casualties. (19th Telegram)

(Chongqing) Chinese troops near Fancheng shot down a Japanese plane. Japanese planes attacked Xiangyang, a Chinese military base in central China, as well as Zhengzhou, a key point connecting the Longhai and Pinghan railways. (19th Huitong Telegram)

(Changsha) The British missionary Li Xiebong, who was killed by Japanese planes in Pingjiang, was the head of the Pingjiang Union District of the Hunan Diocese of the Methodist Church. He was only 35 years old, graduated from the London Methodist Theological Seminary, came to China in 1931, returned to London once in 1937, and came to China again in January of this year. Li was praised by the locals for his administration of the Pingjiang church. When Japanese planes attacked Pingjiang on the 15th, Li was taking refuge in an air-raid shelter next to Qinren School with Pastor Gao Keli and his servant's family of seven. The shelter was hit by a bomb, killing Li and his servant's entire family. Pastor Gao escaped from the rubble and was slightly injured. Pastor Baker Fang, the head of the Hunan Diocese of the Methodist Church, rushed to Pingjiang from Changsha on the morning of the 17th after hearing the bad news to take care of the aftermath for Li. He returned to Changsha that evening. The reporter visited him and learned that Li's body had been dug out from the collapsed air-raid shelter. The condition was terrible and he will be buried in Pingjiang. Pastor Baker also said that Pingjiang had been attacked by Japanese planes 27 times as of the 15th. Because the county is an undefended city, the Japanese planes flew low over the city to observe and drop bombs each time. The Pumou Hospital and Peiren School, which are run by the Methodist Church, are connected to the pastor's residence and occupy a large area in Xiguan, Pingjiang. The rooftops are marked with British flags and have huge British flags hanging on them. It is believed that the Japanese pilots must have known that this was the location of the British charitable organization during the 27 attacks. However, they dropped four large bombs, which makes us feel resentful. The British in Hunan have urgently telegraphed the British Embassy in China to report Li's death in the Japanese bombing, and have also telegraphed his wife in London and his four-year-old daughter to report the bereavement.

### Former Confidential Secretary to Prince Demchugdongrub, Qi Peizhang, Arrives in Chongqing

Qi Exposes Japanese Conspiracy to Drugging Mongolians, Predicts Prince De Will Soon Revolt

(Chongqing) Qi Peizhang (transliteration), a young Mongolian nobleman aged 28, was sent to Tokyo for studies by Prince Demchugdongrub in 1934. He was recalled at the end of last year to serve as Prince De's confidential secretary. Although Qi studied in Japan, he is an anti-Japanese activist. He recently crossed the western part of Suiyuan, overcoming many dangers to reach Chongqing. He reported the situation in Inner Mongolia to the National Government. According to his statement to the Associated Press, he "eloped" after serving as a confidential secretary to the "Mongolian United Autonomous Government" for 28 days. He said that the Japanese are currently intensifying the training of young people in Inner Mongolia under the principle of "Asia for Asians". They claim that the Mongolian and Japanese people share the same origin thousands of years ago. Therefore, the Japanese established a "Mongolian College" in Guihua and "Youth Schools" in Zhangjiakou and Baotou, intending to drug the Inner Mongolian youth and make them pro-Japanese. In addition, the Japanese are also encouraging opium smoking and prostitution in Inner Mongolia. Qi said that Prince De has always been regarded as a traitor, but "he is not so bad as all that." Under Japanese surveillance, Prince De appears to be in great pain. The Japanese garrison in Inner Mongolia consists of only one division, while the Mongolian army under Prince De has nine divisions. They are supplied by the Japanese Kwantung Army from the Northeast, like parasites of the Kwantung Army. The Mongolian army is under strict surveillance by the Japanese army, so it has no heavy artillery. Qi predicted that Prince De would soon revolt. When he left Prince De's headquarters at the end of January, he learned that the Japanese were rushing to build fortifications at various passes between Inner and Outer Mongolia to prevent invasion from Outer Mongolia.

### Chinese Industrial Cooperative Movement: A Grand Plan Underway

Hopes to Establish Cooperative Associations in Guerrilla Areas to Supply Chinese Army Needs and Prevent Japanese Goods Sales

(Chongqing) Alec, Deputy Director of the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Movement, has returned here today after departing from Jiangxi and inspecting cooperative centers in the Northwest provinces. It is said that the Chinese Industrial Cooperative Movement is currently undertaking a large-scale plan. The objectives of this movement are: (1) to supply the industrial needs of the interior during wartime; (2) to help solve the wartime refugee problem; (3) to help solve the problem of disabled soldiers; and (4) to reduce the need for imported goods. This movement hopes to establish cooperative associations in the guerrilla areas to meet the needs of the guerrillas and prevent the sale of Japanese goods in the occupied areas. This movement began last autumn after Alec traveled from Shanghai to Wuhan and presented his plan to Chinese leaders. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and President H.H. Kung have expressed their concern for this. According to a spokesperson for the movement, there are currently five headquarters, one each in the Northwest provinces, the Southwest provinces, the Southeast provinces, the Sichuan-Kang provinces, and Yunnan province. A total of 179 industrial cooperatives have been established. It is hoped that the number will reach about 500 within two months. The goal of this movement is to establish 30,000 industrial cooperatives throughout the country. It is now planned to establish industrial cooperatives in the interior to develop small-scale industries. According to Alec, although there are many Chinese laborers, they are not intellectuals, but they quickly understand the meaning of cooperation. He was particularly impressed by this point. He happily observed female factory workers in the Northwest provinces working in the giant caves of the mountains. They had been evacuated from Hankou to the Northwest through the efforts of Madame Chiang Kai-shek. In response to Mr. Alec's questions, they unanimously stated that they hoped to continue their current lives and did not want to return to factory life in Hankou. Currently, several locations have a daily business volume of as much as 10,000 yuan. Those in charge of this movement have recently appealed for continued capital allocation to expand this movement to all parts of China. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### French Chamber of Deputies Passes Government's Full Powers Bill

France is Embarking on the Path of War Preparation; Premier Stresses the Seriousness of the Situation

(Paris) Since the Chamber of Deputies granted French Premier Daladier the dictatorial power to deal with omnipotent countries, France has embarked on the basis of war. This power is only seen since the Clemenceau cabinet in the Great War. The power requested by the French Premier in the original proposal is limited to November of this year, and may be extended if necessary. When the Chamber of Deputies voted yesterday, the Socialist Party proposed two counter-proposals, which were both rejected by 316 votes to 262 and 328 votes to 254. The bill has now been submitted to the Senate, which is expected to pass it in the same way. The cabinet is scheduled to meet today and tomorrow to discuss how to promote measures to enhance France's military and industrial strength. (Associated Press dispatch, 19th)

(Paris) The full powers bill proposed by the government, after being discussed twice in the Chamber of Deputies, was passed by a vote of 321 to 264. Beforehand, many amendments proposed by members of the opposition parties were rejected one by one. Premier Daladier also delivered a tough speech, stressing that this bill must not be altered by a single word. He said that if the country encounters an emergency in the future, the government must take various measures to deal with it within hours, and it is impossible not to have full powers. The situation of the Chamber of Deputies meeting is recorded as follows:

(1) At the meeting of the Chamber of Deputies this morning, Schmidt, the reporter of the Finance Committee, immediately submitted a review report, saying that various military measures occupy a larger position, and it is important to expedite the manufacture of military equipment and stockpile raw materials. Right-wing member Grilis continued to speak, stating that the current situation was caused by the Munich Agreement. If a war occurs in the future, its danger will be greater than six months ago. How can we give full powers to the signatories of the Munich Agreement? Bergerie, a left-wing independent member, advocated national unity and convening a world economic conference to discuss the promotion of international trade. Maran, leader of the right-wing Republican Federation, expressed his trust in Premier Daladier. Essgarde-Figeac, a centralist member, said that after the Czech incident, reconciliation between France and Italy was easier than before. The Chamber of Deputies immediately rejected the amendments proposed by the opposition parties by a vote of 334 to 258.

(2) At the afternoon meeting, Communist leader Dougroux and Socialist member Mounet successively spoke, both opposing the government's full powers bill. Right-wing members Roland and Hélo stated that they were willing to vote in favor. Premier Daladier then delivered a speech, stating that the French government has lodged a strong protest against Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia. The situation is so serious that empty words cannot solve the problem. The reason for requesting the passage of the full powers bill is to quickly respond to major incidents. This is a "matter of hours" and cannot be delayed. Members, please answer with yes or no. If you want to amend it, even a single word is unacceptable to me. Although there are many thorns ahead, I firmly believe that my compatriots will be able to work together to overcome them. Even if some people do not think it is possible, I will ignore them and continue to move forward. At this point, we must intensify our efforts. The government may require workers across the country to increase working hours and take other more resolute measures. It is also possible that the term of office of members of the Chamber of Deputies may be extended. After the Premier finished speaking, the Chamber of Deputies immediately put the government's original proposal to a vote and finally passed it by a vote of 321 to 264. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

(Paris) After the full powers bill was passed by the Chamber of Deputies yesterday, the Senate Finance Committee immediately submitted it for review in the afternoon of today and decided to submit it to the Senate for discussion in the afternoon. It is expected to pass and be established by a large majority. As for the measures that the government intends to take, there are two types: (1) Regarding the number of army personnel, after a large number of Spanish government soldiers fled to France, the French authorities continued to increase the number of troops stationed on the southern border to be responsible for surveillance. The defense of other places is therefore not without impact, so it is necessary to replenish the number of army personnel to compensate. (2) Regarding military equipment, the number of manufactured items is increased and various important raw materials are purchased in preparation for emergencies. In addition, the current wartime national organization law may also be amended so that various factories and their workers can be requisitioned when necessary. (Havas, 19th)

### German Influence Continues Eastward, Soviet Union is Highly Concerned

Romania Already Feels Threatened, Appeals to Allied Nations for Real Assistance

(Moscow) Last night, all sectors of the Soviet Union remained silent regarding possible actions the Soviet Union might take to respond to German pressure on Romania, awaiting official release of information on the matter. This silence does not indicate that the Soviet authorities do not take seriously any action that might bring their most dangerous enemy, Germany, closer to their borders. Well-informed sources believe that if Romania's integrity is threatened, the Soviet Union will have no choice but to deal with it with strong measures, especially because the Soviet Union's interests in Ukraine will be significantly affected. These strong measures may be similar to those used in the Sino-Japanese War. After Japan's invasion of China, the Soviet Union established friendly relations with China and provided material assistance. Stalin's remarks at the Communist Party Congress on March 10, stating that Germany's future expansionary actions would be westward, seem to indicate that Germany's recent actions have startled the Soviet Union. However, it must not be forgotten that the swallowing of Czechoslovakia after the Munich Agreement was already expected. In addition, another passage in Stalin's speech, stating, "We intend to provide assistance to countries that have suffered aggression and are fighting for national independence, and it is also worth looking back," is noteworthy. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

(London) Tonight, newspapers published news of Romania's deployment of troops. Although Romania's mobilization has not been officially acknowledged, the *Evening Standard* said that Bucharest had issued a mobilization order for five army corps. King Carol of Romania has stated to the British government that if Britain and France can provide assistance, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia can unanimously insist. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

Bucharest, Romania. Although the official authorities here have solemnly denied the news about Germany's ultimatum to Romania, public opinion is still concerned about it. They believe that Germany's intention to gradually expand its influence in Romania can no longer be concealed. The approach of German troops to the Romanian border is enough to cause anxiety. Those in charge say that Romania must obtain the full assistance of its allies and friendly countries in order to negotiate with Germany on an equal footing. At the same time, public opinion in Yugoslavia, Poland, and even Bulgaria has changed, and all disapprove of Germany's actions. This is very comforting. The key to future events lies in seizing the opportunity and uniting with each other. What is unknowable is whether the Hungarian government will sacrifice its independence to serve Germany. (Havas dispatch, 19th)

Prague, Czech Republic. Most of the German troops here have withdrawn and are reportedly moving eastward. Today, the Czech capital is quiet, and there have been no military impediments to transportation. However, planes soar through the sky all day long. German police have now replaced German soldiers on the streets. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)

### Eastern Europe Forms Defensive Line to Prevent German Expansion

British Foreign Secretary Strongly Advocates in Cabinet Meeting; Changing Times Force Britain to Shift Policy

(London) According to reliable sources, the cabinet meeting held this afternoon focused on the German threat to Romania. It approved Prime Minister Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham. Foreign Secretary Halifax also reported in detail on the Central European situation, taking into account the information sent from the capitals of Czechoslovakia, Germany, and Romania. He also explained the situation regarding the British government's protest to Germany and the recall of the British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson. The cabinet immediately approved it. Foreign Secretary Halifax then expressed his opinion, advocating that a defensive line be formed from Poland, through Romania and Greece, to Turkey, to prevent Germany's continued eastward expansion. Although this proposal was opposed by Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon and several other cabinet members, Prime Minister Chamberlain and most of the cabinet members expressed their support. Once French President Lebrun comes to visit next week and the two sides conduct official talks, a firm decision can be made. In addition, Foreign Secretary Halifax also reported on his meetings with French Ambassador Corbin, Soviet Ambassador Maisky, German Ambassador Dirksen, and American Ambassador Kennedy. According to reports, Ambassador Maisky expressed his disappointment after the Munich Agreement, but if countries take collective action at this time to prevent Germany from expanding its influence, it should still be supported. When he later met with Ambassador Dirksen, he protested to him and informed him that the British government was determined to take the most resolute attitude. He then informed Ambassador Kennedy that the British government was gradually implementing a concrete policy of resisting aggression. According to general knowledge, the cabinet will discuss the military deployment commonly adopted in peacetime within the next week, and the issue of conscription should be included. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

(London) Today's newspapers paid great attention to Romania's request for British assistance after receiving Germany's economic ultimatum and the consequences of this move, and published terrifying descriptions of the European crisis. It also reported that a new line of great powers, led by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and supported by Poland, Romania, Greece, Turkey, and Yugoslavia, has been proposed and is being discussed openly. According to several diplomatic correspondents, this proposal was discussed at the cabinet meeting last night, but no decision was made pending completion of consultations with the various dominions. In addition, there are many reports that the four great peace nations of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union may convene a meeting to discuss a common policy. The newspapers do not try to reveal Germany's current intentions, as they believe that this secret is tightly wrapped up between Hitler and his close advisors who met in Vienna last night. The newspapers everywhere remind the public that German troops are moving eastward and their destination is still unknown. According to the Warsaw correspondent of the *Sunday Times*, Poland and Hungary, which share a common border that Germany must pass through to advance into Romania, have begun political and military discussions. There are also reports that talks between the two countries will begin today. According to the diplomatic correspondent of the *Sunday Times*, Romanian Ambassador Tilea told British Foreign Secretary Halifax on Friday that 44 German divisions were partly in Czechoslovakia and the rest were mobilizing in Germany and were prepared to move eastward. Romanian opinion believes that even if Germany is preparing to attack Romania, this military action cannot be realized within ten days. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)

(London) According to observations from diplomatic circles in various countries here, Chamberlain's speech in Birmingham yesterday marked Britain's abandonment of its appeasement policy. It was a statement of Britain's past policies toward Germany, and a statement that British-German relations had returned to the same state they were on the eve of the outbreak of the Great War. In short, the British Prime Minister's speech was the biggest change in Britain's domestic and foreign policies since the Great War. In his speech, Mr. Chamberlain had already acknowledged that his appeasement policy had completely failed. Mr. Zhang's question about Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia being the first step in conquering the world by force was exactly the same as the various fears that Britain had about Germany on the eve of the Great War. The result of Germany's actions is to promote closer cooperation between Britain and France, which can be seen more clearly from French President Lebrun's visit to London on Tuesday. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)

Germany Submits

Economic Proposal to Romania

Reports in British Newspapers Confirmed to be Facts; Germany Denies Issuing Ultimatum

(London) Regarding the news that Germany has submitted an economic proposal to Romania, the diplomatic affairs correspondent of Havas has learned that the news carried by the *Times* day before yesterday is completely accurate, but it is slightly inaccurate to say that it was an ultimatum. The denial issued by Germany is intended to save face. According to reports, the *Times* has reported that Walter, a German economist, has made two demands to the Romanian government: (1) Romania should gradually abandon its industrial construction plan, successively close existing factories, and focus on developing agriculture; (2) Various products such as grains, oil, wood, and livestock can only be sold to Germany. If the above can be followed, Germany is prepared to guarantee Romania's territorial integrity and national independence. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

(Berlin) Rumors that Germany has submitted an ultimatum to Romania have recently been denied by semi-official circles here, calling it unfounded and saying that the economic negotiations currently underway between Germany and Romania are only aimed at developing bilateral trade. The various rumors are intended to increase the tension of the international situation and should not be believed. (Havas dispatch, 18th)

### Soviet Union's Criticism of German Government; Does Not Recognize German Annexation of Czechoslovakia

Also Denies Making Promises to Aid Romania; British and French Protests Rejected by Germany

(Moscow) The Soviet government has sent a note to the German government stating its non-recognition of Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia, saying: "The Soviet government cannot but regard the German military occupation of various provinces of Czechoslovakia and subsequent actions of the German government as autocratic, tyrannical, and aggressive. In the Soviet government's view, the German government's actions not only run counter to the elimination of dangers to universal peace, but also create and increase such dangers. The German government has undermined the political stability of Eastern Europe, increased the factors of alarm, and dealt a new blow to the sense of tranquility of the people of Central Europe." Regarding the rumor that Romania had received a concrete promise of Soviet assistance, qualified sources in the Soviet Union say that Romania had not requested aid from the Soviet Union, nor had the Soviet Union given any promises. (Reuters, 19th)

(Berlin) An official communiqué was released this evening stating: "After the British and French ambassadors deemed the actions taken by Germany to restore peace and order in Bohemia and Moravia and to appease the situation in Central Europe as illegal and protested to the diplomatic authorities, the diplomatic authorities immediately replied separately, stating that this protest has no basis politically, legally, or even spiritually, and the German government finds it difficult to consider." (Havas, 18th)

(Paris) It is reported that the German government's response to the British and French protests still claims that this decision was made with the consent of the Czechoslovak government. (Havas, 18th)

Czechoslovak Embassy in France Refuses to Turn Over to Germany

(London) After the British government telegraphed for the British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, to return home for consultation, the German Ambassador to Britain, Dirksen, hurried back to Berlin at 2 PM this afternoon. (Havas, 19th)

### German Aggression Against Other Nations; Economy Followed by Politics

Intends to Use Methods Against Hungary on Romania

Sufficient to Promote Unity of Democratic Front

(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent reports that Foreign Secretary Halifax today discussed the situation arising from Romania's appeal for British aid to resist German economic demands with the ambassadors of France, the Soviet Union, the United States. It is heard that liaison between Britain and Romania has now been intensified, and Romania's determination to resist German aggression with all its strength has also been strengthened. The news obtained by London yesterday regarding German economic demands on Romania was originally what the Romanian side wished to publish, but the Romanian capital later denied it, presumably in the hope that Germany might change its position. Recalling that after the settlement of the Sudetenland issue last September, Germany made similar demands on Hungary, restricting it to being an agricultural country and limiting its military strength. Now that Germany has drawn Hungary into its economic sphere and placed the Hungarian army in an insignificant position, it is preparing to continue its steps to annex territories closer to Vienna, starting with the economy and then continuing with politics. It is believed that the British Cabinet will discuss Britain's attitude towards this and the results of the Foreign Secretary's contact with various diplomats this morning at its meeting this afternoon. Although the German side stated that the German Ambassador's meeting with the British Foreign Secretary was a routine matter, it is certain that the British Foreign Secretary took this opportunity to reiterate to the German Ambassador Britain's position that the occupation of Czechoslovakia cannot be regarded as legal. Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited the Foreign Office's chief diplomatic advisor, Vansittart, yesterday to discuss recent developments, and was later received by Foreign Secretary Halifax to exchange views. It is heard that the issue of mutual action was also raised during the talks. (Reuters, 18th)

French President Accompanied by Foreign Minister Scheduled to Visit Britain

Jointly Discuss How to Cope with Overall Situation; Significance of This Trip is Significant

Brest Naval Port: President Lebrun is scheduled to travel to Britain on the 21st of this month aboard the "Côte d'Azur" mail ship to return the visit. At that time, he will be escorted by the second squadron of the Atlantic Fleet, which includes three destroyers and three torpedo boats. They left this port today, preparing to proceed via Cherbourg to Calais in northern France to await orders. (Havas, 19th)

(Paris) President Lebrun is scheduled to lead Foreign Minister Bonnet to London on the 21st to return the invitation of King George VI of England. This trip is undoubtedly of great importance in the current international situation. Taking this opportunity, Foreign Minister Bonnet can hold detailed discussions with British Foreign Secretary Halifax on the general situation in Europe, and immediately discuss how to deal with Germany's threats to Romania and Hungary. Moreover, the harmonious relationship between the British and French nations is close and seamless, and this will be fully demonstrated. In addition, political figures have said that the protests made by Britain and France to the German government yesterday are not just empty words. This can be seen from the fact that Britain and France refuse to recognize the fait accompli and have each recalled their ambassadors to Germany to report on their duties. Furthermore, Britain and France are trying to approach the Soviet Union and Poland. Among them, France has already signed concrete and reliable treaties with these countries (referring to the Franco-Polish alliance treaty and the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty), and Britain intends to conduct economic negotiations with them to increase trade relations. This is the focus of the diplomatic policies of Britain and France. As for the most important issue at the moment, it is whether Italy will take advantage of the opportunity to make demands. Regarding this matter, France's position is very clear. Not only has it repeatedly made solemn statements, resolving not to give up an inch of land or its various rights, but also since the plenary powers bill was voted through by the Chamber of Deputies, the French government's position has become stable and it can deal with the difficult times with greater authority. (Havas, 19th)

British Cabinet Meeting Countermeasures to Cope with Situation; Notification to Various Dominions

(London) The Cabinet met at 5 PM today. All cabinet members attended except for Hoare and Hore-Belisha, who were ill. The meeting lasted until 7:20 PM. It is heard that a general review of the entire situation was conducted. During the meeting, thousands of people gathered in Downing Street, demonstrating the public's attention to the situation. The date of the next cabinet meeting is undetermined, but Prime Minister Chamberlain will stay in London this week to keep in touch with the situation. Before the meeting, former Foreign Secretary Eden met with Foreign Secretary Halifax for twenty minutes. (Reuters, 18th)

(London) Dominion Secretary Inskip convened a meeting with senior officials from various dominions in Britain this afternoon to inform them of the latest international developments.

Mussolini's Mouthpiece, Gayda's Article

(Rome) The famous journalist Gayda (known as Mussolini's spokesperson) recently published an article in the Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" commenting on the Czechoslovakian incident, briefly stating that this case will soon expand, "The democratic countries should take this incident as a warning and restore their offensive strength to strangle the survival needs of the totalitarian countries." As for Italy, it has never regarded the Munich Agreement as the "end point," and therefore does not find this incident strange. Gayda finally mentioned Italy's wishes for France, saying, "Even though Italy is peace-loving to this day, France still responds with a warlike and rigid attitude, which is quite wrong." (Havas, 19th)

(London) The attitude of Hungary and Italy towards recent events and the possibility of new German moves remains ambiguous. The diplomatic correspondent of "The Observer" made an interesting report, saying that Hitler had advised Mussolini not to demand the occupation of French territories from France at this time, but only to ask France to make concessions in Tunisia and reduce its sovereignty, and that he could follow Hitler's methods in the Sudetenland in the future. (Reuters, 19th)

### Germany Levies Punitive Taxes on Imports; United States Applies Economic Pressure on Germany

Applicable to Japan and Other Treaty-Breaking Countries

Does Not Recognize German Annexation of Czechoslovakia as Legal; Will Take Parallel Actions with Britain, France, and Soviet Union

(Washington) The U.S. government announced last night that, in retaliation for Germany's aggression in Europe and its attempts to use economic power to invade the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. government will impose a "punitive tax" on German imports. This tax will take effect on March 23rd. Congress expects that the government will also use such restrictive measures against Japan and other countries that violate treaties. The Treasury Department also announced that the government had notified Britain and France of the imposition of a "punitive tax" on German imports. The U.S. State Department yesterday condemned the Nazi Party in very sharp language and decided to retaliate against Germany's actions in Czechoslovakia. According to information revealed by Under Secretary of State Welles, the United States will send a note to Germany stating the American people's resentment of the Nazi Party's annexation of Czechoslovakia. It is expected that the note will express in clear and direct terms that the United States will definitely refuse to recognize Germany's seizure of Czechoslovakia as legal. Welles said that the note will respond to Berlin's official note regarding the Nazi Party's occupation of Bohemia and Moravia. The United States, Britain, and France are taking the same stance and will unanimously refuse to recognize Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia. However, regarding external reports that Britain intends to convene a four-power conference, including the three democratic countries and the Soviet Union, to plan to stop German aggression, Welles said he had heard nothing about it. (Associated Press, 19th)

(Washington) According to news from here today, the "punitive tax" announced by the Treasury Department on German imports will, in addition to collecting ordinary higher tax rates, also levy 25% as a "punishment." Commercial experts say that this new tax may reduce the import of Nazi Party goods into the United States to a very low level. It is heard that the Treasury Department's announcement was based on the opinion of U.S. Comptroller General McCarl, who believes that Germany's subsidies for U.S. exports in order to exchange for U.S. cotton, reaching 33.33%, are very inappropriate. Recently, Germany has been implementing subsidies for general exporters due to its weak business. (Associated Press, 19th)

(Washington) President Roosevelt, in his message to Congress on January 4th, said that apart from resorting to war, he intended to apply pressure to aggressor countries. Government officials recently declared that the U.S. government now intends to implement this pressure on Germany. The measures already decided include the following: (1) The various preferential treatments previously given by the United States to Czechoslovakia in commerce and finance will now be cancelled, and Germany will not be allowed to inherit these preferential treatments. (2) An additional 25% tax will be levied on German imports. In addition to these two measures, the U.S. will not recognize the new situation in Central Europe and believes that the Czech people's surrender is only a temporary situation. This expression by the United States contains the unofficial meaning of encouraging Czechoslovakia. After Under Secretary of State Welles made a formal declaration condemning Germany, Britain and France immediately issued similar statements and formally protested. Such parallel actions by the three countries will certainly strengthen President Roosevelt's position, which is indeed a very gratifying phenomenon. More generally, the international situation has undergone profound changes. The appeasement policy towards the European situation has also ceased to be implemented after Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in Birmingham. Peace-loving countries must have realized that the only way to stop Germany from continuing to annex territories in Europe is to rely on force. Especially since Germany's actions are not yet its main stage, because its desires do not stop there, the current situation is unlikely to be stabilized from this point on. The U.S. government, regardless of the opposition of isolationists, resolutely demanded the amendment of the current Neutrality Act to strengthen the resistance of democratic countries. This is why. (Havas, 18th)

(Washington) Assistant Secretary of State Welles stated today that there is no basis for speculation that the United States will join Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to discuss containing aggression. The official notification from Germany last night regarding its coup d'état in Central Europe was sent to the United States. The State Department intends to publish the notes exchanged between the United States and Germany to clarify the official position of the United States. U.S. Minister to Czechoslovakia, Carr, is still in office. A decision on Carr's status is expected to be announced within a few days. (Reuters, 18th)

### Beneš to Organize Czech Provisional Government in America

Los Angeles: According to Czechoslovak Consul Janovský, former Czechoslovak President Beneš will soon announce the formation of a Czech provisional government in the United States. (Reuters, 19th)

### Pittman to Propose Amendment to Neutrality Act

Belligerents Purchase Arms from the United States; Transaction to be Based on Cash

(Washington) Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman is scheduled to submit a new legislative bill to the Senate on the 20th of this month, advocating the repeal of the current Neutrality Act and authorizing the President to (1) designate belligerents within 30 days of the outbreak of war, (2) once belligerents are designated, U.S. merchant ships shall not load goods to be transported to those countries, (3) all belligerents may purchase various items from the United States, including weapons, but must purchase them with cash and transport them themselves, (4) prohibiting loans or credits to belligerents, (5) the above provisions shall not apply to any American countries that do not participate in wars outside of the Americas. (Havas, 18th)

(Washington) Since Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman announced that he would propose an amendment to the U.S. current Neutrality Act in Congress, it is generally expected here that the United States will increase its economic pressure and unfriendly economic actions on dictatorial countries. Pittman's amendment will give the U.S. President broader discretionary power to sell arms to "countries that should go to war and countries that should not go to war," and transactions will be based on cash. According to Pittman, if this case can be established, there is no need for the President to declare the existence of a state of war for the Sino-Japanese War; this law can automatically apply. The case stipulates that "regardless of whether or not declaration procedures have been followed, the President may declare a list of countries involved in the war after 30 days of war and apply the cash transaction method." According to Pittman, the UK will definitely benefit more from this method. (AP, 19th)

New Neutrality Act Contains Four Key Points

(Washington) In addition to what is seen in another telegram, the main points of the Neutrality Act amendment proposed by Pittman are as follows: This case also advocates authorizing the President to prohibit U.S. citizens and all ships from going to specially designated war zones after the outbreak of war, but with several provisos to facilitate Red Cross relief work. Pittman recently gave a speech saying that there are four key points to the bill he drafted: (1) It does not apply to foreign civil wars. If Congress can vote on this case before the end of the Spanish Civil War, the measure prohibiting the transport of arms to Spain will naturally be withdrawn. (2) Countries that do not have large-scale arms factories can purchase weapons from the United States during wartime. The unfairness of the current Neutrality Act is thus corrected. (3) The advantages actually occupied by major naval powers are thus determined. (4) U.S. private arms factories can develop more easily, which is inherently beneficial to national defense. (5) The foreign sales channels of U.S. weapons can be preserved. A certain congressman proposed a motion to simply abolish the current Neutrality Act. He believes that although this law is incomplete, the issue of national neutrality should be governed by appropriate provisions, and he therefore proposed this amendment based on his limited knowledge. It is not authorized by the government. Political figures recently commented that Pittman's case is indeed part of the government's plan. Its main purpose is to give President Roosevelt greater freedom of action so that he can easily assist the democratic countries in the event of war in Europe. (Havas, 18th)

U.S. Gives Moral Support to Czech Minister

(Washington) According to responsible sources, the U.S. State Department will refuse to assist the German Embassy in taking over the Czech Embassy. The U.S. government will give "full moral support" to the Czech Minister to the U.S., Hurban, in his struggle to prevent the Germans from occupying the Czech Embassy's property. (Reuters, 18th)

German Troops Parade in Prague

Czech People's Hearts Not Dead; Puppet Leader Embarrassed to Participate

Prague: German army troops paraded in the city this morning, lasting two hours. Only Germans watched, while most Czechs avoided going to the countryside and took down the national flags that they were ordered to hang to express their protest. However, various important officials of the Czech government, such as Prime Minister Beran, Defense Minister Syrový, and Foreign Minister Chvalkovský, were ordered by the German authorities to participate in the parade.

Alas, Czechoslovakia, Many Suicides Under Foreign Rule

National Subjugation Education Being Implemented Within the Country

Prague: Suicide cases are increasing daily here. The famous surgeon Medill and his wife committed suicide by taking medicine on the day the German troops entered the city. Twenty Jews who attempted suicide and were hospitalized include a senior court official and a bank president. Another person fell from the top of the wireless radio station and died. According to news from Bratislava, the German Ministry of Education has decided that Slovak children will henceforth be given education suitable for the spirit of the Nazi Party. From May onwards, elementary school teachers will generally be replaced by Aryans. Images of the late leader of the Slovak National Party, Father Hlinka, and Hitler must be placed in the schools, and Nazi salutes must be forcibly performed. (Reuters, 19th)

Ukrainian Militia Resists Hungarian Army

Fighting Very Fierce

Making the Invaders Pay an Appropriate Price

Sighetu Marmației, Romania: Near Pokrovsk in Ruthenia, the most intense war between Ukrainian and Hungarian troops occurred this morning. The Ukrainian militia fought very hard. The Hungarian side had no choice but to send reinforcements from Tyachiv. This morning at 4:30 AM, the Ukrainian militia retreated, and 350 people entered Romania and were detained. (Reuters, 18th)

Bucharest, Romania: Prime Minister Voloshyn of Carpatho-Ukraine left Cluj yesterday morning, heading for Yugoslavia. Before leaving, he told reporters, "I believe that the Carpatho-Ukraine issue cannot be resolved immediately. The Ukrainian people will definitely struggle. Although I do not know whether the Hungarian army has occupied the entire province of Carpatho-Ukraine, I am convinced that the 'Sich' defense organization will do its best to resist, so that the invaders must also pay an appropriate price." According to people close to Voloshyn, Voloshyn may travel to London after arriving in Yugoslavia. (Haitong, 19th)

Germany Manufactures Puppets in Slovakia

Two Sides Have Signed Agreement; Recognize Slovakia as Independent State

Bratislava: German political figures invited Slovak political leaders Tiso, Tuka, and others to Vienna yesterday to discuss the constitutional status of the Slovak state until 3:00 AM. (Haitong, 19th)

Bratislava: It is heard that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has signed an agreement with Slovak Foreign Minister Ďurčanský, formally recognizing the state as an independent state. (Havas, 18th)

(Berlin) The official side has yet to announce anything about the relationship between Germany and the Slovak state. As far as is generally known, the German government's annexation of Bohemia and Moravia has caused resentment abroad. As a remedy, it intends to allow the Slovak state authorities to declare their relationship with Germany under complete sovereignty and pressure the state authorities to accept this proposal, but it has been opposed. The reason why Führer Hitler refused to meet with Slovak Prime Minister Tiso and others in Vienna a few days ago is probably because of this. Authoritative observers here recently commented that Germany originally wanted to make the Slovak state a protectorate, but it did not want to declare it itself, and wanted to shift this responsibility to the state authorities. (Havas, 18th)

Germany Newly Establishes Air Force Brigade

Headquarters in Vienna

(Berlin) After Germany merged the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, German Air Force Minister General Göring issued an order to establish the Fourth Brigade of the Air Force. The German Air Force's establishment has only had three brigades. The headquarters of the Fourth Air Force Team is located in Vienna, and its jurisdiction includes Ostmark (formerly Austria), Bohemia, Moravia, part of the Sudetenland, and Upper Silesia. General Löhr will serve as the brigade commander of the Fourth Team. (Haitong, 14th)

German Action Second Step

British Newspaper's Speculation

Greenwich: "The Greenwich Time" reported today that Germany will send an ultimatum to France in the near future, demanding the return of pre-war colonies and demanding the return of sovereignty over Alsace-Lorraine. The newspaper also predicted that Germany would quickly strengthen its defenses in the east and make slight changes to most Czech fortresses or forts to make them sufficient as Germany's new defense lines. Military figures in democratic countries are currently paying close attention to Germany's second decision. (AP, 19th)

South African Federation Emergency Preparedness

Preventing German Disruption

Johannesburg, South Africa: The South African Federation is now implementing a large-scale preparedness plan to protect transportation and important public services. The authorities took this action because the German side's note to South Africa stated that if South Africa still does not allow Germans to enter the country, the German side will not be responsible for the consequences, etc. Three South African Air Force teams are preparing everything, and their base is located on the Witwatersrand. All police and air force reserves have been called up. Power plants, radio stations, telegraph bureaus, and gasoline stations have been defended. German workers in the Pretoria steel plant rioted yesterday and were suppressed by troops dispatched from the Witwatersrand. (Reuters, 19th)

### The Campaign Slogs On Without Success, and Friction Intensifies: Conflict Between Japanese Naval and Army Forces in Guangdong

Yokohama Specie Bank Suffers Huge Losses

Shantou Dispatch: According to military sources in Huiyang, the Potian Brigade from Taiwan recently appeared between Dongguan, Taiping, and Chashan. The Japanese troops from Shilong, after withdrawing on the 8th, suddenly turned back and reinforced with two additional regiments, establishing strongholds in Futian, Zhengguo, Changping, and Shitan, with the intention of attacking Luofu Mountain again. The Japanese army has been invading Guangzhou for five months, but the campaign slogs on without success. The naval and army forces have different strategies and compete for leadership, leading to intensified friction. The "Good Citizen Certificates" issued by the Japanese army are not recognized in the tributaries of the Pearl River. From Humen Taiping to Huangpu, Nantoutou, and the south of Henan, the area is under naval control. People carrying cloth-based Good Citizen Certificates are often seen having them torn up by the Japanese navy. The Japanese army is now using wooden Good Citizen Certificates to prevent the navy from tearing them up. Naval plainclothes personnel entering and leaving the urban areas are also often bullied. Taiwanese and Korean soldiers can only lower their heads and suffer in silence, not daring to argue. At noon on the 6th, more than ten marines from the Tajima landing force disembarked at Nantoutou and marched into Guangzhou city, clashing with army sentries. Gunfire erupted immediately, causing great chaos in the city. Criminals took the opportunity to loot. It is reported that Yokohama Specie Bank lost more than 200,000 yuan in banknotes, and there were many casualties. (March 10th)

Ms. Sterling Speaks

The People of Guangxi Province Are Filled with Patriotic Fervor

The Government Does Its Best to Care for Refugees

Continental Daily News reports that Ms. Sterling, of the Southern Baptist Church, who has just arrived in Shanghai from Guilin, told reporters yesterday (the 18th) that the Guangxi Provincial Government has achieved remarkable results in handling the heavy burden caused by the war and does not attempt to shift its responsibility to others. Although refugees are pouring into Guilin from all directions, the provincial government is taking care of them in a systematic way. Although I have not witnessed it myself, I have heard that registration offices have been set up every ten li along major transportation routes. Refugees fill in their names at the registration offices, and the authorities provide free transportation to the extremely poor and give them three dimes in silver each day. In the past two months, frequent morning rains have prevented Guilin from being bombed by Japanese planes. During this period, although several air raid alerts were heard, no bombs were dropped. Whenever the air raid sirens sounded, a rare spectacle occurred: the 200,000 residents of Guilin climbed the specially built steps, crossed the city walls, and went to the stone caves in the nearby mountains for temporary shelter. During the air raid alerts, although all civilians evacuated, the police remained at their posts. If a house was hit by a bomb, the local police would guard the property until the homeowner returned home. If someone's residence was destroyed, the authorities would provide some public buildings for them to live in until they could build a new house. After the outbreak of the war, the daily routine has changed. Due to the risk of air raids in the morning, business must be conducted between 3:00 PM and midnight. Although there have been no air raids in the past two months, there have been bombings before, and half of the houses in the city have been destroyed. As for industrial cooperatives, none have been established in Guilin yet, but preliminary investigations are underway. Commerce in Guilin seems quite prosperous. People everywhere are preparing to resist the Japanese army, and signs of military activity can be seen everywhere. The Friends of Wounded Soldiers Association, a group that helps wounded soldiers, is carrying out arduous tasks in Guilin.

Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangsu

Closing in on Huaiyin

Fierce Fighting at Zhaoguan Dam

Taixian Correspondence: The Japanese army has decided to launch a large-scale invasion of northern Jiangsu and has successively invaded the counties of Huai, Si, Fu, and Bao. Except for the fact that the Chinese troops recovered Suijing quickly, so losses were relatively minor, the losses in other places such as Siyang, Lianshui, Donghai, Muyang, Funing, Huaiyin, and Huaian were very heavy. According to an investigation, although most of the residents of Huaiyin had been evacuated before it was abandoned and public utilities had been destroyed, the Japanese army looted miscellaneous items from the people after capturing the city and transported away more than 200 boxes. More than 200 civilians were shot dead, and countless rapes occurred. Furthermore, Funing was heavily bombed by Japanese planes, and after they briefly invaded the county seat, most of the houses in the city were reduced to ashes, and countless residents were massacred. The county was recovered by Chinese troops the day before yesterday, and efforts are being made to appease the local people. The other counties also suffered severely from looting, and the situation is still under investigation. Huaiyin and Haizhou are now under siege and counterattack by a new force of Chinese troops and armed civilians, and the fighting is extremely intense. There is a rumor that the county seat of Huaiyin has already been recovered by Chinese troops. Also, more than 200 Japanese soldiers from Shaobo lightly attacked the Chinese army's Zhaoguan Dam position at noon on the 10th, with heavy artillery fire. The Chinese defenders bravely resisted, and after fierce fighting until the afternoon, the Japanese army was defeated and retreated. Dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed and many were wounded in this battle, and a large number of bullets were consumed. The Chinese side suffered no significant losses, and the Chen position remained as solid as a rock. On the morning of the 12th, the Japanese army used six trucks to transport wounded Japanese soldiers and corpses from Shaobo to Yangzhou. On the morning of the 12th, Japanese troops at Huangjue Bridge in Xishan, Yangzhou, had contact with Chinese guerrillas. On the morning of the 13th, there was also artillery fire in the southwest of Yangzhou. It is reported that the Doujia Bridge was raided by Chinese troops, and the Japanese army also suffered casualties.

Desolate Scene in Suqian

No Commerce Within the City

The North-China Daily News reports that Suqian fell on November 22nd last year. On December 2nd and 3rd, the Chinese army counterattacked the city, causing heavy losses to the Japanese army in terms of manpower and equipment, but failed to recover it. Since then, no counterattack has been launched, but the Chinese army is still within five miles northeast of the city (as of February 27th). Most of the Chinese troops are on the east bank of the Grand Canal, while Suqian is on the west bank. The Chinese troops in the vicinity include various units such as the Central Army, the Jiangsu Provincial Army, and guerrillas. Their artillery and mechanized equipment are not sufficient for an offensive, but they have shown astonishing strength in defense. The 57th Division is generally considered to be the best trained and equipped among the troops in northern Jiangsu.

Although Suqian has been lost

for three months, the city is still on the front line. Anyone with experience knows what this means. The city gates of Suqian's outer city are heavily guarded, and no one is allowed to enter or leave. Moreover, in some respects, the regulations are now stricter than before. Those with "Good Citizen Certificates" were once allowed to enter and leave, but even they have not been allowed to enter or leave freely for several weeks. Every five days, those with "Good Citizen Certificates" can enter the city, but under no circumstances can they leave again. Unless some changes occur, they are virtually prisoners. At the beginning of Suqian's fall, American expatriates could enter and leave the city gates, but now they cannot. Since the establishment of the local puppet regime, the five American missionaries in Suqian have lived in houses outside the south side of the city, establishing a refugee camp. The entrance of the house is only sixty yards from the south city gate. A machine gun nest is built close to the house, so the house is surrounded on three sides. Every night, the Japanese army shoots aimlessly and incessantly, to intimidate the Chinese troops who are patrolling or operating in the suburbs. The artillery inside the city also often

Opens Fire in Response

and randomly throws grenades everywhere. Anyone who complains about the sounds of Shanghai at night can try sleeping in this house for one night. The refugee camp once housed seven or eight hundred people, including hospital employees. Currently, there are fewer than six hundred people. Most of the refugees buy their own food to cook, and those who are penniless receive free food twice a day. So far, the supply of food and fuel has not been completely interrupted, but fuel was once scarce and expensive. It is probably unnecessary to elaborate on the general business situation, which is extremely bad. Since the fall of Suqian, no one in the city is engaged in any kind of commerce. Recently, a Korean person opened a store selling sugar, beer, cigarettes, and canned goods. Some Chinese merchants have transported most of their goods from the city to villages and towns to avoid air raids. Now some of these goods are sold in the villages, towns, and local markets. Trade in local products is quite prosperous in some small town markets. Imported goods are becoming increasingly scarce. Homes are destroyed, families are scattered, and there are many grieving people. It is undoubtedly a tragic period in recent history.

Li Bai's Wartime History

He Achieved Merit Early in His Military Career

Interview with Zhang Guoquan

Among the military and political personnel of Guangxi, no one does not know "Teacher Zhang." He is from Yangshuo and was a teacher of Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Huang Xuchu, Huang Shaohong, and others in their youth. Even now, they still call him "Teacher Zhang." Therefore, everyone also calls him "Teacher Zhang" instead of his name. Perhaps he is the only surviving teacher of these four gentlemen, and I did not want to miss the opportunity to interview him. Teacher Zhang's residence is on Xianqian Street, less than fifty steps from the county government. It faces east and is a stone-lintelled house with two bays, which looks newly built. A robust child handed in my business card. I initially thought he was Teacher Zhang's grandson, but later learned that he was his only beloved son. After a moment, a servant brought out tea and cigarettes. Then "Teacher Zhang," wearing a dark gray silk wide robe and a pair of cloth shoes, came out from the inner building to meet me. Although he was already fifty-six years old, he had not yet grown a beard and looked at least ten years younger than his age. His steady gait and firm handshake showed that he had a youthful period in military life. I first expressed my greetings and explained the purpose of my visit. Teacher Zhang graduated from the first class of the Baoding Xiehe Class, the predecessor of the Baoding Military Academy, at the end of the Qing Dynasty. The Governor-General was Duan Qirui, and the Superintendent was Qu Tongfeng. There were infantry, cavalry, artillery, engineering, and transport departments, and the course lasted two and a half years. After the second class of the Xiehe Class graduated, it was renamed the Baoding Military Academy. During the reign of Emperor Xuantong, he graduated from the Japanese Military Academy and returned to China with Cai Songpo from Yunnan, Zhuang Yunkuan from Jiangsu, and others. He founded the Army Elementary School in Guilin, Guangxi. Li Bai and the two Huangs were the first students of this elementary school. At that time, these "distinguished students" were only teenagers, but among the more than one hundred students, he felt that they were "endowed with great talent" and "diligent in learning." "I am not saying this now because they are all in prominent positions. I am not trying to flatter them or boast," Teacher Zhang said. "De Lin and Jian Sheng are indeed astute and courageous. In the early years of the Republic of China, I led troops, and De Lin served as a company commander under me. Once during a battle in Hunan, his cheek was pierced by a bullet. I told him to withdraw, but he persisted until the task was completed before leaving the battlefield. After he recovered, a battalion commander position happened to be vacant, so I promoted him. Jian Sheng, while suppressing bandits in southern Guangxi Province, unfortunately broke his leg. Although he was sent to Guangdong for treatment and recovered, he still limps somewhat when walking. His decisiveness was evident from a young age." He said that he was originally a member of the proletariat, and the new house he now lives in was built for him last year by these "classmates." He used to live in Hong Kong and often goes to Guilin after returning to his hometown. "I either stay at Li's house or eat at Bai's house." He is truly a respectable teacher. On the evening of the very day I interviewed him, Teacher Zhang actually walked along the muddy village road to the Lequn Society to return my visit, which I found to be an honor I did not deserve. That evening, he was wearing a leather hat and holding a copper-tipped bamboo dry tobacco pipe, showing some signs of age, but he was in high spirits. He spoke a lot about the customs and local conditions of Yangshuo. It was already dark when he left. He smiled and said, "After you come to Yangshuo for fun, you should pay us some taxes." I also smiled and said, "Alright then!" He said, "Please write more articles in the newspapers to attract more tourists to our local area." I wanted to send him back, but he insisted on refusing, saying, "In my own home, everyone should lead the way." I had no choice but to give up. Zhang also inscribed the words "National Golden Voice" for this newspaper. Teacher Zhang's name is Guoquan, and his courtesy name is Zhenou. He is currently a lieutenant general参军 in the Fifth Route Army Headquarters. He often makes suggestions on military planning to Li Bai, which are often adopted. (The End)

### Donghua Lost to French Business School 2-3 Yesterday, But Still Won the First Division Runner-Up

The Second Round of Competition Results Do Not Count, and the Venue Is Closed Early, Ending the Season Ahead of Schedule

In yesterday's Western League First Division soccer game, Donghua lost to the French Business School 2-3 at the Yiyuan, but Donghua has already won the First Division runner-up. The outcome of yesterday's game was irrelevant. The reason is as follows: The Yiyuan Stadium needs to be resurfaced with grass, so the decision was made to close early. The lease on the racecourse will also expire soon, so the venue situation has become a serious problem. The Western League soccer competition will therefore end early. According to news from the Western League, it has been confirmed that yesterday's First Division league game between Donghua and the French Business School at Yiyuan was the final act. The rankings of all teams will be calculated according to the first round. The other reserve, second, and third divisions will also be completed within two weeks. As for the cup competition, only one game remains in the junior cup final, which will be decided on Thursday (the 23rd). Since the rankings are calculated according to the first round results, Donghua's runner-up position is secure. In yesterday's game, Donghua initially had an advantage, taking a 2-1 lead, but in the second half, they collapsed. In the end, they lost 3-2. There were only a thousand or so spectators.

Wan Jin Scores First; Huang Mao Arrives Late. The French Business School only had ten players to start the game. Both sides attacked and defended, but there was no tension. Wan Jin crossed the ball, and Ade, Shiyan, and Youliang made several passes, but they were blocked for a corner kick. Youliang took the corner, and Ade headed the ball, but the old man, Raymond, caught it cleanly. Xianghua shot at the goal, but it lacked power, and Raymond caught it again. Then Wan Jin received a pass from Shu Shigeng and shot, but it was caught again. After fourteen minutes, Aja passed to Dai, Dai passed to Xianghua, and Xianghua immediately passed to Wan Jin. He kicked with his left foot, hitting the left corner perfectly.

Donghua Takes the Lead. After going up 1-0, Huang Mao had not yet arrived. It was not until twenty-three minutes that he finally arrived late. Donghua's offense remained strong. After a short pause, Bao Xiu shot fiercely. Qin BiGao did not catch it, but fortunately it hit outside the net. Aja and Shiyan passed to each other skillfully and went deep into the enemy's formation, sending the ball to the center, less than seven yards from the goal. Azae was sure to score, but it went wide, and Raymond panicked and swiped at it, resulting in a corner kick. After the corner kick, Xian Jielun fouled at twenty yards, and Ade took the free kick, but it was ineffective. Cai Shengsen intercepted the ball and passed to Youliang. He shot fiercely from fifteen yards and scored. The score was recorded at thirty-six minutes, and Donghua had an absolute advantage of 2-0. The French Business School then changed its formation, with Jiesu and Niubao switching positions. Then Huang Mao tried a fifty-yard dash. Fortunately, Qin BiGao recovered from his mistake and prevented an own goal. But at forty-two minutes, Hua Te lofted a shot from twelve yards, and the first half ended 2-1.

Losing Two Goals in a Row. After the lemon (halftime), Qin BiGao caught Jiem's shot. Huang Mao tried another dash, Qin could not help but panic, losing control and fumbling. Although it was saved, the morale was affected. Shen, Dai, and Jia made a beautiful series of passes, and Ade shot, but the old man saved it again. At nineteen minutes, Zhuang Youren attempted a back heel, but slipped. Then Bao Xiu rushed over, and from three yards, he swept the ball horizontally. Qin BiGao watched the ball go in, unable to save it. The score was tied 2-2. After that, Donghua was in danger repeatedly, but the front line did not lose heart and continued to launch sharp attacks. At thirty minutes, Bao Xiu shot powerfully and beautifully, and Qin BiGao blocked it into a corner kick. Meng Nuotuo took the corner, and Jiem scored with one kick. The French Business School came from behind to win 3-2. At forty minutes, Zhuang Youren rushed out and passed to Cai, who immediately passed to Wan Jin. There was no enemy defender in front, and the opportunity was very good, but he touched it too far, and no one was there to receive it. Thus, Donghua suffered a defeat in a winnable situation, which is deeply regrettable.

Donghua soccer team had six wins in six games in the Western League Reserve Division, and it seemed that the championship was already in their grasp. Yesterday, they faced West Captors at Jiaozhou Park in the second-to-last game. Because many players were absent, they were replaced by First Division players who had just played a strenuous game in the morning, so they were defeated. After the game started, Donghua was penalized with a penalty kick, which Zhuo Lunzifu scored. At fifteen minutes, Gao Baozheng shot and scored, making it 1-1. The first half ended in a draw. Only two minutes after the start of the second half, Ade's penalty kick was saved, and Youliang also shot many times but did not score. At twenty-two minutes, Clark headed the ball in, making it 2-1.

Donghua is in second place with six wins and one loss in seven games, for a total of twelve points. They still have one game against St. Francis, and if they win, they will still be the champion. If they draw, they will share the title with West Fords and West Captors.

### The 2nd Minkuang Cup Cross-Country Race: Lido Team Retains Championship

Hui Zhen Wins Second Place, Individual Champion Wang Zheng Lin's 5,000-Meter Time is 17 Minutes 18 Seconds

The 2nd Minkuang Cup Open Cross-Country Championship, organized by Minkuang Middle School, started yesterday morning in the chilly spring air in front of the school gate on Jiaozhou Road. A total of fourteen teams participated in this year's event, with 129 athletes. However, 25 people were absent yesterday morning, so the actual number of participants was 104. The entire course was 5,000 meters long. As a result of the competition, Lido once again displayed its prowess. Because the entire team was well-staffed, they won the championship with a score of 41. Wang Zheng Lin of that team won the individual first place with a record of 17 minutes and 18 seconds, retaining the double championship. Hui Zhen team took second place with 44 points, a difference of only three points. The intensity of the competition at the time was evident. Awards were given on the spot after the race.

Race Progression: At 8:00 AM, elite troops from all sides set off. Guan Youwen took the lead, with Zhang Liang, Wang Shiying and others advancing in formation. Wang Zheng Lin was in the back of the pack. After passing Hart Road, Wang Zheng Lin overtook Guan Youwen, with Ling Xuewen on his right. Guan Youwen ran side by side with Liu Guangfa. At that time, the front was entirely dominated by elites from the Lido and Hui Zhen teams. Turning into Gordon Road, Ling Xuewen gradually weakened, and Liu Guangfa moved up to second place. When arriving at the Yufosi (Jade Buddha Temple) Binlang Road, Guan Youwen was more than 30 meters behind. Wang and Liu Guangfa still led proudly. Arriving at the intersection of Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road, about 1,500 meters from the finish line, Wang Zheng Lin rose up with divine power, and Liu Guangfa gradually weakened. At Connaught Road, Wang Zheng Lin was still in the lead, and Liu Guangfa was already falling behind. With the finish line in sight, Old Wang calmly and unhurriedly reached the finish line first amidst thousands of applauses. Liu Guangfa finished second, 60 meters behind. Guan Youwen finished third, another 80 meters behind. Xu Peigong and Ling Xuewen fought hard at the end, finishing fourth and fifth respectively.

Guangxi Province has been working hard to eliminate illiteracy for the past four years, reducing it by more than 1.5 million. There are still more than 1.82 million adults who are out of school. This year is specifically designated as the Adult Education Year, with the aim of eradicating illiteracy within one year, strengthening public mobilization work, and leveraging the power of resistance against Japan and national reconstruction. The implementation plan has been approved, and it has been decided to establish provincial and county-level adult education year promotion committees. In mid-March, inspectors were dispatched to all districts in the province to cooperate with the administrative commissioners of each district, convening third-section chiefs from subordinate counties to discuss and then go to each county to form promotion committees and begin work. Nearly one million in funding has been raised, and it has been decided to mobilize six thousand teachers to teach illiterate adults of both sexes aged 18 to 45. Textbooks are provided by the government, stationery is provided by the students, and the study period is set at two months, two hours per day, without holidays.

### Zhejiang Education Department Orders Provincial Schools to Increase Publicly Funded and Tuition-Free Spots, Universally Awarding and Assisting Poor Students to Enroll

(Jinhua Correspondence) The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, after investigating the fact that people's lives have been difficult since the War of Resistance, and they cannot afford to pay for their children's education, and the situation of young people dropping out of school is becoming increasingly serious, in order to relieve those who have dropped out of school, it was decided last year that all provincial schools would be exempt from tuition fees starting from the first semester of the 27th year. Now, within the budget of the provincial education and culture expenses for the 28th year, the number of publicly funded spots will be increased so that poor students can benefit more. The department has now made overall arrangements, and starting from this semester, the number of publicly funded and tuition-free spots for new students in specialized, high school, and junior high school programs will be increased to account for 14% of the class size, that is, 7 publicly funded and 7 tuition-free students per class of 50 people. For continuing students, a maximum of 2 additional students may be added to each category per class. The number of publicly funded spots for normal school and vocational students will be increased to account for 18% of the class size for new students, that is, 9 publicly funded students per class of 50 people, and a maximum of 4 additional students may be added to each category per class for continuing students. Except for the affiliated elementary school part, special orders are issued to each school to understand the government's purpose of awarding and assisting poor and outstanding students, and to properly handle it to benefit the impoverished.

### The Crystallization of Love as the Key to Maintaining Marital Affection

— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University

Those who do not experience the love of women after marriage today inevitably lack the inherent charm of men and have physiological defects, especially the loss of the reproductive function, which is most important. The relationship between husband and wife is that the husband loves his wife, and the wife receives the husband's love. Therefore, the harmony between the two allows the family to maintain peace and happiness. Although the wife is passively loved by the husband, once she becomes a mother, she immediately reverses course and becomes an active lover, because her child is weaker and inferior to herself. Therefore, at this time, a woman has two qualifications: she is passively loved by her husband and actively loves her child. She even extends her love to her husband. Therefore, although the love between husband and wife may gradually fade over time, the wife can still maintain the peace of the family with tenderness and affection once there is a crystallization of love. It is no coincidence that people call women those who are born in love and die in love. Observing from this point, people who self-indulge before marriage and those who indulge in sex after marriage often lose their reproductive functions, and cannot be loved by their spouse or produce offspring, trapping their wives in the loneliness of a desert, eventually leading to emotional breakdown and the loss of all happiness!

According to physiological analysis, the presence or absence of offspring requires examination of whether the reproductive function is diseased. If the reproductive function suffers from disease, premature ejaculation and impotence will not only erupt one by one, but the patient's life will also be in imminent danger. However, according to my many years of experience in treating the above-mentioned conditions, if youth gland extracts can be actively used to treat the condition, they can often start to bring back youth. For example, the genuine and powerful animal youth gland extract preparation for men "Bu Ti Kang" invented by German Dr. Mellen is made based on the above principle. Therefore, after taking it, the reproductive function returns to health, the mind feels particularly refreshed, and the spirit is exceptionally invigorated. All previous symptoms such as impotence, premature ejaculation, neurasthenia, and incomplete development are thoroughly eliminated. Therefore, it is praised by Chinese and foreign physicians, who are happy to recommend it to patients. Why does "Bu Ti Kang" have this rejuvenating effect? It is because the main component of this preparation is extracted from animal testicular essence. Using animal testicular essence to supplement the deficiency of human essence is no wonder it has a significant effect. It also contains brain-boosting phosphorus, which can supplement the brain and strengthen the mind. However, when purchasing, it is necessary to specify this kind of medicine, because miscellaneous brands do not have this kind of great medicinal power.

As for the female "Bu Ti Kang", it is the best of the ovarian endocrine agents. Those who have irregular menstruation, withered breasts, infertility after marriage, and symptoms of frigidity can be cured after taking it.

Modern Medicine

### The Prerequisite for Treating Gonorrhea

— Written by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine in the United States

Eradicating Gonococci is the Prerequisite for Eliminating Gonorrheal Toxin

What Medicine Can Take on This Important Responsibility of Expelling Gonorrhea?

To study the method of fundamentally eradicating gonorrhea, we must first understand the life of the pathogenic bacteria of gonorrhea. Regarding this level, Dr. Peter, the German master of gonorrhea, has the most insights. He spent more than thirty years of painstaking effort, and finally invented the medicine "Kelin Nong" made by mixing protein body yellow pigment and other substances. The characteristic of this medicine is that after taking it, it can generate an anti-gonococcal phagocytic effect in the shortest time, that is, it reaches the lesion directly from the blood very quickly, surrounds and annihilates all the gonococci, so that the cunning gonococci have nowhere to escape. Therefore, gonorrhea patients, whether at the beginning or accidentally taking inferior medicines on the market, which causes vicious symptoms, can take German "Kelin Nong" to save themselves. It can indeed be completely cured in four or five weeks.

Before "Kelin Nong" was invented, governments around the world raised the banner of eradicating gonococci and promoted it to the world, but in terms of results, 9 out of 10 were failures. Although there was a heavy reward, there were still no brave men. However, Westerners, after such encouragement and promotion by their own governments, all medical scientists immersed themselves in diligent research, and the research results of German gonorrhea scholar Dr. Peter were even more amazing, because with the above-mentioned effects of "Kelin Nong," gonococci naturally no longer had the ability to resist. They could only be completely subdued by "Kelin Nong" and completely eliminated. This is indeed an unprecedented miracle in the treatment of gonorrhea, which is very different from today's general chemical therapy, membrane-penetrating sterilization therapy, and preparations such as sandalwood oil and cubeb. Because these over-the-counter drugs have strong medicinal properties and large side effects, the gains do not outweigh the losses. Therefore, governments of various countries have given Dr. Peter huge bonuses to reward his hard work in invention. In the case of all gonorrhea, there is no hope of fundamental cure without taking "Kelin Nong." In terms of external medicines, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally, and women can use "Carols Shendi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. Both can be treated at home by following the diagrams and instructions, which is especially effective.

### Clinical Experience in Treating Nocturnal Emission and Premature Ejaculation

— Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine in Germany

Patient Yan Youkang, 25 years old, from Le'an County, Jiangxi Province, (self-report) - Likes to pursue pleasure, and committed masturbation at the age of 17. After three years, the body gradually deteriorated, and nocturnal emission was frequent. He asked Chinese and Western doctors for treatment, and took more than ten doses of medicine, but saw no effect. After getting married at the age of 21, he often suffered from premature ejaculation. Due to life circumstances, he was busy all day long, and his mind was full of complex thoughts every day, so he had no time to seek medical attention, which led to dizziness and inability to work. He begs for treatment. (Symptoms) - Nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation, seminal fluid slips out after urination, memory loss, headache, easy excitement and fatigue, severe sleep disorders, palpitations, tinnitus, and back pain. Weight at the time of diagnosis was 97 pounds. (Treatment Method) - Ordered him to take good care of himself, abstain from sex in the short term, avoid physical overwork, pay attention to urination before going to bed, rub the area with cold water, take "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Tablets" to calm the brain and consolidate the sperm gate to stop nocturnal emission, and administer a large amount of testicular essence preparation "Bu Ti Kang" for men to treat various weaknesses caused by nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation. One month later, the headache was cured and the spirit was lifted, and the back pain was gone. After taking it for two months, all symptoms disappeared and there was no premature ejaculation.

Lecture on Gonorrhea

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road

### Soft Infiltration of the Posterior Urethra

According to Aubry's view, soft infiltration of the posterior urethra due to gonorrhea is mostly due to uric acid, urinary sediment of phosphate, or excessive sexual activity, or excessive masturbation. It is also often seen in patients with genital tuberculosis. In addition, it is even more common in Atonie der Biase, mucosal catarrah with bleeding easily seen in Bestbarn. In terms of the distribution of inflammation, the prostate part around the internal sphincter is invaded by inflammation, but the membranous part is the closest to the entrance of the inflammatory invasion. If this situation is examined with a urethroscope, it can be completely and clearly treated. Therefore, doctors must pay close attention to it.

For posterior urethritis, the future changes of the disease are often unpredictable. Therefore, doctors must quickly and thoroughly cure soft lubrication of gonorrhea-related posterior urethritis, because such mucosal infiltration often causes the urethral mucosa to adhere to each other, but instead causes urethral obstruction and narrowing, and there is a risk of uremia. Therefore, a thorough treatment must be performed. I use German static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy, and at the same time take the gonorrhea panacea "Kelin Nong" as an oral medicine to make the body produce anti-gonococcal phagocytosis. This medicine is a world-renowned pain reliever that collects infiltrated mucosa to restore its inherent health. In this way, not only can the inflammation be completely eradicated, but the terrible other complications of gonorrhea can also be naturally and naturally cured. Because the soft infiltration of the posterior urethra, its complications can cause early swelling of the sperm, which has a huge hindrance to fertility. But now that there are such therapies, it can be avoided.

Clinic Hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 patients will be seen each day, and each number will only cost 50 cents.

### The Latest Holy Medicine for Curing Lung Diseases

— Physician Sheng Zaiqiang

There are many therapies for lung diseases, but there is no specific medicine that can cure them. Since ancient times, many unfortunate lung disease patients have sacrificed under the sentence of "no specific medicine."

Recently, due to scientific development, medicine and pharmacology have shown a rapid momentum, and the treatment of lung diseases has also made great progress. The medicine "Bu Fei Naer" (Lung Tonic) was invented under the driving force of science. This agent has proven to be effective in a short period of time for all stages of lung disease, and can gradually reduce the cavities in the lungs until they are as flat as ever. Therefore, "Bu Fei Naer" has been promoted as the chief priest among oral medicines for lung diseases. This is by no means an exaggeration. For various coughs before becoming consumption, taking "Bu Fei Naer" can relieve coughs within three hours.

Addendum: Bu Ti Kang for men and women, 5 yuan each per bottle, Nairis Nocturnal Emission Tablets, 2 yuan per bottle, Bu Fei Naer, 2.5 yuan per box, Kelin Nong, 2.5 yuan per bottle, Carols Shendi Vaginal Tablets, 2.5 yuan per bottle, Anti-Gonorrhea Water, 2.5 yuan per bottle.

Available at all pharmacies. For mail orders from outside the city, please remit payment directly to Haimideng Western Medicine Store, No. 9 Ningbo Road, British Concession, Shanghai, and it will be sent immediately.

### China's Economic Diplomacy During Wartime

— Zhang Xiaomei

Dr. Zhang Xiaomei is a renowned economist both in China and abroad. She has served as the Director of the Economic Research Office of the Bank of China and has also been in charge of the China National Economic Research Institute. It is said that Dr. Zhang has also been appointed as the Deputy Director of the National Southwest Economic Research Institute, which is currently being prepared for establishment. This article is a chapter from Dr. Zhang's newly compiled "China and Foreign Economic Yearbook," which is published by the China National Economic Research Institute and is scheduled for sale on March 25th. We are deeply grateful to Dr. Zhang for allowing our publication to publish it in advance, and we hope our readers will pay attention to it. Editor.

(I) The Key to Victory or Defeat in Modern Warfare

In the World War of 1914, Germany single-handedly resisted and fought for four years, ultimately suffering defeat. This was not due to unfavorable conditions on the front lines, but rather to the inadequacy of the home front. General Ludendorff, based on his experience in the Great War, advocated the theory of total war, believing that in modern warfare there is no distinction between the front and the rear. Victory or defeat is determined not by the quantity of armaments but by the strength of the nation's resources. This is no longer limited to the clash of the two armies, but a struggle between two great nations.

As the ancient saying goes, "Victory or defeat is a common occurrence for military strategists." This is especially true today. Temporary gains or losses are not enough to be a key to victory. The endurance of the war, leading to final victory, depends on the resilience of the entire nation and the strength of the entire national economy, especially the latter as a prerequisite for the material basis of a long-term war of resistance.

Furthermore, modern international relations are intricate and complex. Disputes between two countries are often sufficient to trigger conflicts of interest involving related third countries or even the entire world. China, often referred to as a semi-colonial country, has always been a battleground for great powers. Japan's war against China is undoubtedly aimed at excluding the influence of Europe and America in the Far East, blockading China's door, and allowing Japan to enjoy it exclusively. Therefore, since the September 18th Incident, the Sino-Japanese conflict has long been a major performance on the international political stage. Since the July 7th Incident developed into the August 13th Battle, although the great powers have not actively performed due to various reasons, their spiritual and material sympathy and assistance to China have played a considerable role. Especially today, after the world has become aware of Japan's ambition to swallow China alone, they can no longer sit idly by. For example, Britain and the United States have successively presented Japan with strong diplomatic notes and have resolutely moved from spiritual sympathy for China to material assistance. Our country is fighting for independent survival and has national resources hundreds of times greater than Japan as its backing. Whether or not we can obtain foreign resources is not enough to sway our determination and real strength to win the war. However, obtaining foreign resources during wartime can indeed make the strength of the war of resistance more substantial. Moreover, our country's industry is backward, and modern military-industrial industry has no foundation to speak of. Therefore, striving for overseas resources is an indispensable step in the great cause of the war of resistance. The European War ended with the participation of the United States. On the surface, it was because the Allied Powers had this new force to join, and they were able to defeat the exhausted German army. In essence, it was because Germany was poor in resources, and therefore could not use overseas resources to make up for it, which led to its rapid collapse.

Our government, aware of this, ordered the stabilization of finance at the beginning of the war, engaged in the relocation of industries, promoted the industrial cooperative movement, and built the Southwest. It also developed resources, rectified the domestic economy, maintained credit, recognized the principle of open doors, expressed welcome to foreign investment, and worked hard to cooperate economically with friendly countries. Now, after a year and a half of the war of resistance, the currency system is stable, the economy is stable, and the international community praises it unanimously.

(II) The International Development of Resisting Aggression

Resisting aggression lies in our resolute resistance to the war until the final victory. If friends of our allies can uphold the principles of justice and humanity and take economic sanctions against the aggressors, their efforts will be doubled. This has already been mentioned earlier. Therefore, at the beginning of March 1938, the Chinese delegation in Beijing published the economic conditions for resisting Japan's aggression against China as follows:

(1) Prohibit the supply of military or industrial raw materials to Japan. Because Japan's military and industrial raw materials are largely dependent on foreign countries, if various countries stop supplying them, even if it is limited to a small number of major items, it will inevitably be severely hit.

(2) Boycott Japanese goods and Japanese ships. Japan's international balance of payments depends on the export of industrial products and its shipping income to achieve balance. If various countries boycott Japanese goods and Japanese ships, it will not only put its industry to death, but also destroy its entire national economy.

(3) Refuse credit to Japan. Japan's war expenses are huge, and domestic resources are limited. Without foreign credit, it will not be able to take care of itself, let alone develop the gains of aggression. If various countries refuse credit, not only will it not be able to obtain profits like the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars, but it can also strengthen the effectiveness of points one and two.

(4) Economic measures of a considerable minority of countries. Because Japan's supply of raw materials and credit and the market for its exports are not concentrated in a small number of countries, these few countries include the United States, the British Empire, France, and Annam, the Netherlands, and the East Indies, Belgium, etc. If they sever economic relations with Japan, Japan will be like a fish out of water and unable to be active.

(5) Aid China. To strengthen China's ability to resist the war and resist international aggression, peace-loving countries should expand assistance to China and provide extensive military and financial assistance.

On the other hand, in early February 1938, the Executive Committee of the League of Nations passed a resolution to assist China, reiterating the resolution of the previous conference, asking countries to do their best to assist China. At the same time, the International Peace Movement convened an international boycott conference in London, attended by representatives from twenty countries, unanimously passing a boycott resolution, severely punishing acts of aggression. Subsequently, an international peace movement conference was convened in Paris, unanimously opposing Japan's indiscriminate killing of innocent people, resolving to boycott Japanese goods, stop the supply of military materials, encourage loans to China, and resolving to establish the China Relief General Association in London as the central hub of the international China relief movement. Since October of the same year, the association has also published an international China relief newsletter once a month to communicate and promote the development of China relief work in various places. Currently, the international China relief work supported by these international peace groups is generally advancing along the following three major lines: (1) Urging governments to implement the League of Nations' resolutions on sanctions against Japan? (2) Expanding the boycott of Japanese goods movement, (3) Donating money, donating medicines and clothing, and providing relief to Chinese wounded soldiers and refugees.

(III) Achievements of Our Country's Economic Diplomacy

The aforementioned China relief work is all automatically carried out by fair-minded people around the world, and all are implemented in the form of civil organizations, which cannot be regarded as the gains of our country's economic diplomacy. The one that is initiated by our government and can be regarded as economic diplomacy work is to strive for financial assistance from various countries to China. Among the current countries, the most sympathetic and influential ones are the three major democratic countries: Britain, the United States, and France. They are described separately below.

China and the United States: China and the United States are located on both sides of the Pacific Ocean and have always been friendly. Since the signing of the Nine-Power Treaty at the Washington Conference, they have become even more harmonious. When the September 18th Incident occurred, former Secretary of State Stimson strongly upheld justice and ran around to appeal, eventually leading to the passage of the non-recognition resolution by the League of Nations. When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, the Chinese people looked up to the United States very deeply. Although there are isolationists and absolute pacifists in American public opinion, most of them condemned aggression and sympathized with the war of resistance. Especially those with a slightly longer-term vision, such as Mr. Stimson and Emory Luccock D.D., pastor of the Shanghai International Church, all reminded the United States of its moral responsibility in the Sino-Japanese war and advocated for some active actions. Renowned Far East commentator Nathaniel Pfeffer also changed his original position of isolationism after observing the results of China's one-year war of resistance and advocated that Americans should not cooperate with the aggressor: "Do not buy (Japanese goods), do not sell (military supplies), do not lend (credit)"; at the same time, cooperate with non-aggressor countries and provide them with various conveniences. The sympathy of American public opinion towards China can be seen from this.

What is noteworthy about Sino-American economic relations after the war is the silver issue and the credit issue.

In 1934, the United States began its silver purchase policy, raising the price of silver. Eventually, China was unable to maintain the silver standard and announced the cessation of the silver standard in November 1935, adopting a managed exchange rate system. In the spring of 1936, Chinese banker Chen Guangfu was commissioned to visit the United States and signed a silver agreement with US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, in which the United States purchased 50 million taels of Chinese silver at a price of US$0.45 per tael.

In July 1937, the first Sino-American agreement expired. At that time, Finance Minister Kong attended the coronation ceremony of the British King and then traveled to the United States, where he renewed the silver agreement, exchanging silver for gold to be used as our country's exchange reserve and export credit guarantee.

In July 1938, the agreement expired again. In late July, the Japanese spread rumors that Britain intended to put China's gold reserves under international co-management. The US Treasury Secretary officially declared that the US purchase of Chinese silver had been extended, with conditions largely unchanged.

According to the August issue of Citibank Monthly: In May 1938, the Chinese government requested the US government to continue purchasing silver to help stabilize Sino-American monetary relations. The two sides then established a rollover agreement to exchange Chinese silver for US dollar credit or gold. In the first half of 1938, 140 million taels of Chinese silver were shipped to New York, worth US$63 million. Since October 1937, a total of 190 million taels of silver have been shipped, worth US$84 million. Since 1934, the United States has purchased a total of 300 million taels of Chinese silver, and the proceeds have been used to bid for gold and as bank deposits. This is an example of monetary cooperation between the United States and China.

However, the destruction of war is unlimited. Therefore, it is not enough to talk about long-term resistance to the war without making great efforts to build and develop resources, let alone talk about post-war revival. It is necessary to use foreign credit.

In late September 1938, the Chinese mission arrived in the United States, still led by banking magnate Mr. Chen Guangfu. On the one hand, they discussed the supply of military supplies and credit with the American business community, and on the other hand, they consulted with the American government on loans.

On October 20th, the US Treasury Department declared that progress had been made in discussions with the Chinese mission.

On December 16th, a US$25 million loan between China and the United States was completed. At the same time, there was also good news about the establishment of a Sino-British loan. This credit is for a period of five years and is purely commercial in nature. Most of it will be used to purchase trucks and gasoline. (To be continued)

### British Gold Reserves

— The Economist. No. 4976 Translated by Chen Baorong

Since the turmoil in Europe, London's position in world finance has declined along with its political position. The era of the British pound dominating the world has almost become a thing of the past. Consequently, the British government's gold reserves have been constantly lost and declined as the pound struggles. The London Economist also admits this frankly. However, based on the magazine's reporter's report on the local gold storage in South Africa, it can be seen that the foundation of the British pound is not as bad as people generally think. The magazine's reporter's proposal to re-evaluate the gold reserves of the Bank of England has now been implemented. Moreover, its view that the future of the British pound depends on the political situation in Europe is now being reflected. We are very grateful to Mr. Chen for translating and providing this article to our publication, and we hope that all those who care about British gold will pay attention to it. Editor.

Sharp Decline in Gold Reserves: The recent British Exchange Equalization Fund, as announced on December 31st of last year, is as follows: (Calculated at 140 shillings per ounce) (Unit: Million Pounds)

1937 1938

March 31st September 30th March 31st September 30th

Bank of England 516.6 537.6 537.6 537.6

Exchange Equalization Fund 186.9 279.3 297.8 151.8

Total 703.5 816.9 835.4 689.4

According to this, the Bank of England's gold reserves have remained stable throughout. However, the Exchange Equalization Fund lost £146 million in gold between April and September. The "Economist" magazine, published on October 22, 1938, estimated that the British Exchange Equalization Fund had lost at least £65 million by the end of May due to the withdrawal of French gold deposits in Britain. In the subsequent two months of August and September, another £100 million of gold had to be successively flowed out. Therefore, it was predicted that the Exchange Equalization Fund would have at most £130 million remaining by September 30th. Today's official report shows that the initial prediction was too pessimistic. Although: The difference between the prediction and the actual number is only £22 million, which seems to be excusable.

Establish a Foreign Treasury?: The average weekly amount of gold transported from South Africa to Britain at the beginning of last year was £1.5 million. However, on September 8th and 15th, it suddenly dropped from £1,054,000 to £353,000, and has not recovered since. However, South Africa has not stopped mining gold. Therefore, it can be seen that the reason why gold is staying in South Africa is probably due to the instructions of the British authorities. In these days of war clouds, it is indeed a good idea to keep a portion of the gold reserves in its own territory for safety reasons.

Recent Gold Reserve Estimates: Three months have passed since this official report was published. In these three months, of course, a large amount of gold has flowed out of Britain. Now, starting from the Exchange Equalization Fund's £152 million on September 30th, let us speculate on the situation of gold outflow after September 30th. First, let's look at the current situation of the import and export of gold in Britain: (Unit: Thousand Pounds)

October to December 1938

Imports Exports

From France 14,028 To the United States 102,984

Belgium 8,340 Canada  3,280

Holland 3,752 Belgium 1,910

Germany 2,570 Eire 1,010

South Africa 1,856 Sweden 978

West Africa 1,668 Switzerland 608

Switzerland 1,610 Others 386

India 1,469

Others 2,304

Total 37,597 Total 111,156

According to the above table, the net export of gold is £73,559,000, but there are still some things to consider. First, in the week before October 6th, £7,661,000 of gold was transported to Britain from Belgium, but this was deposited in London by the Belgian government for safety reasons, so its ownership did not change. On the contrary, it is questionable whether there is any refuge gold included in the £1,910,000 transported to Belgium. If this is taken as an indication of the Belgian people's settlement, then £7,661,000 should be subtracted from the total amount of imports.

Secondly, only £1,856,000 of gold was transported from South Africa. If calculated at £1.5 million per week, there should be £19,500,000. It can be seen that £17,600,000 of British special designated items remained in South Africa in three months. In addition, some of the gold transported to Canada may have been transported by the British authorities for safety reasons, but the amount is unknown.

Based on this, the gold export number can be revised to: (Million Pounds)

Net exports reported 73.6

Plus the import of Belgian refuge gold 7.7

Total 81.3

Minus the estimated number of designated items in South Africa and Canada 18.3

Net loss of the Exchange Equalization Fund 63.0

This amount of only £63 million is not enough to see the whole picture. The settlement purchases in the London gold market can offset this number, because the settlement includes gold imports. However, the situation caused by hoarding purchases is the opposite. After the approval of resale, the Exchange Equalization Fund has supplied £5 million of gold for hoarding in the last three months. In addition, it was also affected by the withdrawal of French gold, which Reynaud estimated to be £34 million, reaching £50 or £60 million by the end of the year. However, those shipped out of London accounted for £30 million.

Although the French Exchange Control has purchased gold pounds today, there is still no record of gold flowing from London into Paris. Some say that this gold pound has been converted into US dollars and has flowed into New York. This is to be expected, but the amount of British gold transferred to French designated items probably does not exceed £5 million at most. Adding the Exchange Equalization Fund's loss in the last three months, estimated at £73 million, then the British Exchange Equalization Fund on December 31, 1938, had only £80 million of gold remaining. (Calculated as an integer)

If calculated at the current market price of 150 shillings per ounce, then £80 million is actually worth £86 million, which can strengthen the technical position of equalizing foreign exchange. The "autumn crisis" has now passed, and most of the "hot money" stored in London has successively flowed out. It is expected that the US dollar will also be sold short, so its price will inevitably rise. As a result, general speculators may turn to need British pounds. In addition, the year-end clearance of the US dollar will enable the Exchange Equalization Fund to have some US dollars or designated gold stored in the United States. This is tantamount to hiding reserves and can recover the gold that the Bank of England sold to the Exchange Equalization Fund at the end of 1936. Recently, the number of trust banknotes issued will recover £30 million, and the extraction of £30 million of gold from the bank's issuing department will reduce its gold reserves by this amount, but the Exchange Equalization Fund will give the bank £30 million of securities. When this gold is transferred to the Exchange Equalization Fund, it can be raised to £53 million, calculated at 150 shillings per ounce. Therefore, the Exchange Equalization Fund's gold reserves will restore the number of £139 million. If there are no major political entanglements in the future, the technical position of the British pound is sufficient to meet general needs.

### Wartime Shanghai Financial Market (Continued)

— Zhu Boquan

(6) Revival of the Cash Market Shanghai's gold market was originally a place for speculators to operate. In the past, monthly transactions often reached three to four million taels, but after the currency reform, it became deserted, with monthly transactions of only four to five thousand taels. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, it stopped completely. China's monetary system was originally based on silver, but since the implementation of the legal tender policy, it has become a managed currency. The exchange rate with foreign currencies has long lost its connection with the fluctuations of world gold and silver prices. However, since the government implemented foreign exchange controls last March, speculators have once again taken advantage of the fluctuations in the world's gold and silver ratios to manipulate them. As a result, the cash trading in Shanghai's unofficial market has suddenly become active. After May last year, the Shanghai cash price was affected by the London market, and a surge began, rising to 2,000 yuan in mid-June (the standard price for ten taels of gold). It once softened, but then rose again, reaching 2,068 yuan in November. At the beginning of March this year, due to a shortage of cash chips, coupled with purchases from North China, it once created a high price of 2,200 yuan, and is currently hovering around 2,100 yuan. Compared with before the war, it has risen by about 1,000 yuan. Although the cash market can affect the movement of a portion of gold, because China's foreign exchange base has become stable and the Sino-American Silver Agreement was also extended last year, it does not seem to have any impact on the overall financial situation.

(7) Changes in Clearinghouse Transactions Shanghai's clearinghouse transactions are divided into three groups: Chinese banks and money shops, and foreign banks. The Chinese Banks Clearing House was established in January 1933, and is sponsored by the Bankers' Joint Reserve Association. Its clearing procedures are similar to those of European and American countries. Money shops also have an organization called the Exchange Remittance Association, but their clearing methods are very outdated. As for the clearing of instruments between Bund banks (including foreign banks and the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China), there is only a reconciliation method and no clearinghouse organization or system.

Before the war, the bank clearinghouse held two clearing sessions every day at 1:00 PM and 3:30 PM. After the war, due to a decrease in instruments, it was changed to once a day at 3:00 PM. From January to July 1937, the average daily clearing amount of the clearinghouse was more than 29 million yuan. From August to December, the daily average was only 7 million yuan, a ratio of about four to one. From January to July 1938, the daily average was only more than 6 million yuan. From August to December, there was a slight improvement, with a daily average of about 9 million yuan. Among the clearing amounts in the months after the war, December 1937 and December 1938 were the lowest, with a daily average of only 3.6 million yuan. However, the clearing amount has gradually increased recently. In January of this year, the daily average clearing amount has reached more than 24 million yuan, almost the same as the daily average before the war, which shows that Shanghai's commercial transactions have gradually become active under special circumstances.

The money shops' clearinghouse transactions are commonly known as "Zha Gong Che." The daily clearing amount includes the amount of interbank lending and transfer accounts, which is different in nature from the bank clearing figures and is difficult to compare. However, general observations show that the trend of the rise and fall of the money shops' clearing amount after the war is the same as that of the bank clearing figures. As for the clearing methods of the money industry, there have been slight improvements after the war. In the past, each money shop sent old cashiers to collect bills separately, but now each money shop sends two clearing staff to the Exchange Remittance Association from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM every day to handle the clearing centrally. In addition, the money shops' interbank clearing bills were originally stipulated that those over 500 yuan should be marked with large public bills, and those under 500 yuan and odd amounts should be marked with small public bills, which were cleared daily at the money industry reserve. In November last year, the Money Industry Association decided to cancel the names of large and small, and all amounts, regardless of the amount, should be marked with one public bill, which should be cleared daily, simplifying the procedures.

As for the clearing procedures of the Bund banks, after verifying the instruments with each other, the Bank of China used large transfer slips for the overall remittance, and the difference was settled daily by means of depositing or withdrawing cash. There was no clearinghouse organization. Since the outbreak of the war, the large transfer slip method adopted in the past has been abandoned, and each bank now sends personnel to the HSBC bank at 11:30 AM every day to conduct centralized verification. In addition, foreign banks have never had deposit and loan relationships with Chinese banks. After the war, for the convenience of clearing, foreign banks exceptionally opened current accounts with our Central Bank, and the Central Bank also opened accounts with foreign banks. As a result, the daily receivables and payables of Chinese and foreign banks are entrusted to each other for collection, and transferred within the current accounts, which is much more convenient than before.

The Situation of the Financial Industry Since the outbreak of the war, the environment in which the Shanghai financial industry is located has been very unusual. Leaving aside foreign banks for the time being, as far as Chinese banks and money shops are concerned, since the July 7th Incident two years ago, there has been a wave of withdrawals. In the month before the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the deposits of various banks and money shops clearly decreased. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the banking and money industry closed for four days. After the government promulgated measures to stabilize the financial situation, people's hearts began to stabilize slightly, and deposits did not decrease significantly. As the war zone expanded, wealthy people from various places came to Shanghai to seek refuge with their assets. As a result, the deposits of various banks and money shops gradually increased. However, most of these increased deposits were current deposits. On the banking and money industry side, it was necessary to accumulate sufficient reserves to respond to the situation.

After the war, the business policies of various banks and money shops strived for stability, and they were very cautious about various loans, mostly reducing the scope of business, only accepting deposits and not making loans. Fortunately, a portion of the pawnshop customers of the banking and money industry who suffered losses in the war, recently benefited from the high prices in Shanghai. In addition to making up for the losses of the war, they also had surpluses. Therefore, the loans made by the banking and money industry before the war, except for customers who suspended business during the war, could often be recovered on time. In addition, the business of various banks, except for a portion of loans, foreign exchange and other businesses, inevitably stagnated after the war, while other businesses such as warehousing, real estate trusts, etc., have increased compared with before the war. This kind of abnormal development is the only phenomenon in the current special environment in Shanghai, and it is self-evident that it cannot last long.

The loss of assets of the banking and money industry during the war was inevitable. Fortunately, most banks and money shops usually operate stably and have sufficient reserves. The previous surpluses are more than enough to offset the current losses. Only a very small number of smaller banks suffered from the impact of the war, and there were rumors of financial difficulties. As for those who went bankrupt as a result, there was only one bank. At the same time, among the four banks that suspended business in the month before the outbreak of the war, two had resumed business one after another last year.

The four banks of the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China are the largest government banks in the country and have outstanding influence in the financial industry. Their head offices were originally located in Shanghai. After the outbreak of the Shanghai war, these four government banks moved their head offices to the inland and established branches in various provinces in the southwest and Hong Kong. Shanghai's financial power has become dispersed. Currently, Shanghai's banks feel that the channels and targets for their usual use of funds have been blocked and reduced after the war. In addition, the government is actively promoting and encouraging investment in the development of agriculture, mining, industry, and commerce in the inland. Therefore, general commercial banks in Shanghai have a tendency to develop towards the inland. Recently, many banks have established branches in the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi. The center of gravity of finance has shifted, and the future development is worthy of attention.

### Notice of the First Symposium of This Journal

### Securities Stock Markets in China and the West Over the Past Week

Due to the sudden tension in the Central European situation last week, trading in various stocks at the Shanghai Public Trading House sharply declined. However, market prices did not show a significant softening. In general, both buyers and sellers adopted a cautious attitude and waited and watched. Several stocks continued to create new highs since 1937, such as International Trust (3.75), Tramway (41), Waterworks A (692.5), B and C (28), and Jardine Spinning and Weaving Factory preferred stock (155).

The most actively traded common stock was Jardine Spinning and Weaving Factory, with over 50,000 shares traded, priced from 1.820 to 18.80 yuan. At the end of the week, due to the deteriorating Central European situation, it followed the British and American stock markets and became weak, closing at 18.50 yuan. Otherwise, it would have been expected to exceed 19 yuan. The second most actively traded stock was International Trust. The company announced that the bond interest owed at the end of September last year would be paid together with the interest due at the end of March this year, proving that its economic position has become sound. Therefore, demand surged, with over 20,000 shares traded throughout the week, priced from 3.20 yuan to 3.75 yuan, and 3.65 yuan at the end of the week. Next was China Land and Plantation, with over 20,000 shares traded, priced from 8 yuan to 8.40 yuan, and 8.20 yuan at the end of the week.

Ewo Land was 9.55 yuan at the beginning of the week and only 9.10 yuan at the end of the week, with only over 1,000 shares traded. Wheelock & Co. traded about half as much as last week, but the price was slightly weaker, closing at 34 yuan at the end of the week. Tramway bearer shares traded over 8,000 shares, with the highest price reaching 41 yuan, falling to 39.75 yuan at the end of the week.

Rubber stocks saw a sharp decline in trading last week, but market prices remained stable. Among them, Kolao was still the most actively traded, followed by Zimo. Bond trading was also sparse. Among them, China General Edison Company traded 74,000 taels, priced between 55.5 taels and 56 taels. China General Telephone Company traded 51,400 yuan, priced at 95.5 yuan. China General Edison Company traded over 40,000 yuan, priced between 90.50 yuan and 91 yuan. International Trust traded 15,000 taels, priced at 80 taels, an increase of 18 taels compared with the trading price half a month ago. The trading amount for the week from March 10 to March 16 is listed in the table on the left:

Common Stock 3,044,100 yuan

Rubber Stock 230,800 yuan

Bonds 250,500 yuan

Total 3,525,400 yuan

Trading in Chinese stocks was still active last week, and prices generally trended upward. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company traded at 6.10 to 6.15 yuan. New Shanghai Company traded at 4.30 yuan. Chinese Securities Company rose to 27.30 yuan. Shanghai Cloth Exchange also rose to 37.70 yuan to 37.75 yuan. China Electric Company closed at 5.425 yuan at the end of the week, also slightly higher than before. Other stocks, such as Great China Match Co., with a bid of 12 yuan, Hanyehping Coal and Iron Company, with a bid of 2 yuan, and China Coal Mining, with a selling price of 70 yuan, did not trade.

### Grains Hetxia Rice Up 30 Cents

Yesterday, the source of domestic rice became even scarcer. Only 1,000 packages of Hetxia rice arrived on the 7th, mainly because most areas in the inland were unable to transport to Shanghai. As a result, the market was stimulated and rose again, showing a chaotic appearance. Thick and thin, high-quality japonica rice was priced at 14 yuan, medium-quality rice was also at 13.67 yuan, and Hetxia rice was around 13 yuan, more than 30 cents higher than the previous market. Duyang, Jianbu, and Bianyuan also increased by 20 to 30 cents. In general, this market situation is entirely due to the obstruction of sources, which stimulates people's desire to go up. If this continues, it will not be a blessing for the people's food in Shanghai.

### Silk and Tea Extracted Core Fine Eyebrow Sales Plate Once Soared

Before that, this port's foreign firm tea market was extremely sparse with inventory. Although the foreign firms have imported, however, the number of transactions was very few and the market situation was silent for a long time. Since a large batch of raw tea was shipped from Ningbo last week, the factories have started work one after another. Until a few factories have made box tea, posted out small samples, the extracted core fine eyebrow sales plate once rose. From one hundred seventy-eighty yuan to a peak record of more than two hundred twenty yuan. According to the raw tea, all of it was purchased by various factories last year, however, it was blocked in Ningbo Port. After several months, the cost of foreign exchange settlement and all handling costs were much higher. The foreign firms, on the other hand, saw that the source goods arrived a little surging, and immediately turned to wait-and-see attitude, which made the market situation tired again and the transaction was still clear.

### Sugar Market Swatow Sugar Production Prices Fluctuate

Yesterday the sugar market association divided the plate, the two four group white and Taikoo sugar were all lacked the slightest difference. Domestic sugar was only continued to open a batch of Swatow mianbai, the price was twenty-four yuan four corner, the cyan red sugar received few hands, no opening was made. However, news from the Swatow gang, after the Tianjin gang stopped doing business and returned to the loose, the production price has now resumed Ningbo gang do business, and also seen a slight rise, but afraid that the amount of business is not surging, it seems that there is no hope of excessive rise.

### North and South Goods Golden Needle Price Slightly Rose

Because the production price of golden needle is difficult to divide, the plate of the number has been slightly higher in recent days, the top factory dish has been opened over thirty-four yuan, the second is thirty-two yuan, and the rest of the medium and second grades have also followed closely, and will be waiting to go to the gastric movement, when there will be a continuation of the solid possibility.

### Fujian Ridge Mushrooms Continued to Sell

The sales of Jian mushrooms are still active, and a batch was continued to be opened yesterday, which is the Gao Zhuang Ridge mushroom, and its price is from two hundred twenty yuan and eight corners to two hundred twenty-seven yuan, and the highest is two hundred thirty-three yuan.

### Seafood Wenzhou Kaiyang Recovers Two Yuan

Wenzhou Kaiyang, the recent arrival and sales are equal, but the medium-grade goods are less. Yesterday, the sales opening rose by two yuan from the previous time, and a few pieces were sold at fifty-seven yuan.

### Coal Hokkaido Coal Rises in Time

In the bituminous coal market, because high-quality goods such as Indian coal are increasingly scarce, and most of the sources are of medium quality, which does not meet the needs of the street, the intention to buy is very strong, and the price is gradually firm. Therefore, Hokkaido coal is rising in time, and the daily turnover can be two or three hundred tons, which is also the trend of the environment. It is estimated that the price of general coal is 35 yuan per ton, screened blocks 37 yuan, and coal chips 34 yuan. Retailers in the industry will add a margin as appropriate.

### Metals White Lead Skin Spot Goods Will Be Exhausted

Since the outbreak of the war, white lead skin has been quiet for a long time due to customs restrictions on exports. Although the Tianjin smokestack gang has occasionally embellished it, the number is small, but for 20 months, the total has been due to the lack of a fixed new relationship, coupled with the battery factory in the street, the printing room, and the tea stack gang have repeatedly needed to do business, and recently the spot goods on the market are about to be sold out, and the standard has risen due to the environment. The selling price is such that No. 2 color sells for 245 yuan per barrel, Nos. 3 and 4 sell for 240 yuan, No. 5 opens for 215 yuan, No. 6 205 yuan, and No. 7 sells for only 195 yuan because there are more circulating goods. The buying price of No. 8 is about 200 yuan, and the market goods of No. 9 and 10 are even thinner, so the asking price is 225 or 6 yuan. Other thick colors are opened at 220 yuan across the board. The trading has been very prosperous in recent days. Although it was Sunday yesterday, it was heard that the transaction still reached 50 or 60 barrels. It is found that the overseas fixed price is 23 and a half pounds per ton, which is also 10 shillings higher than before.

### Piece Goods Flannel Hoarding

The flannel market, because the fixed price is high and the foreign exchange is tight, the sellers are hoarding. The standard opening price is that all are seeing a frenzied rise. The old average annual increase is more than one yuan, and the sellers are still unwilling to sell early. At the moment, the number one gray flannel is shouting to sell at ten yuan and five corners, number two at nine yuan, number three at seven yuan and seven corners, and number four at five yuan and eight corners. The domestic Renli sells at six yuan.

### Spring and Summer Fabrics Have Soared

Yesterday, fabrics such as flannel, spring thin fancy flannel, flannel, wool serge, and straight tribute wool, etc., all had a large number of transactions. Paris flannel, which is the best-selling wool product in late spring, early autumn and summer, is not yet in season, but the current market suddenly jumped first, and all rose by several corners compared to the beginning of the week. The main reason is that a certain domestic product of 200 boxes was confirmed to be "made in England" and was detained in Hong Kong, the market atmosphere suddenly tightened, and the market continued to rise and became popular.

### Hongqiao Japanese Headquarters Heavily Attacked by Guerrillas

Hou's Troops Departing from Panlong, Japanese Aircraft at the Airfield Destroyed

More Than a Dozen Japanese Soldiers Killed, Three Wounded in Hou's Troops

Hou Junren, the leader of the powerful guerrilla forces in western Shanghai, led his troops from Panlong Town yesterday morning when the sky was slightly bright, detouring and advancing towards the Japanese military base in Hongqiao. He surrounded the Japanese military headquarters and launched a fierce attack. Another team of warriors was selected to break into the airfield and destroy a Japanese aircraft. The Japanese army also desperately broke through the encirclement, and the two sides fought for about two hours. Just as the Japanese army was unable to support, the Japanese army from Tushanwan heard the alarm and suddenly dispatched more than 200 security guards to join the battle. Hou was afraid of being outnumbered and falling into a deep encirclement, and the purpose had been achieved, so he led his troops back to their original location. In addition to destroying a Japanese aircraft, more than a dozen Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle, and three warriors were wounded in Hou's troops.

Japanese Army Attacked Xinzhuang and Was Defeated Xinzhuang Town, the fourth station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, is the border between Shanghai and Songjiang, and is connected to the Shanghai-Min Highway. Therefore, for the convenience of controlling and commanding the guerrillas, a headquarters was set up there to carry out mobile warfare in southern and western Shanghai. The Japanese army received a report from a traitor on the morning of the 17th and launched a night attack. Unexpectedly, the guerrillas had already taken precautions and set up an ambush, causing the Japanese army to be surrounded in the village and suddenly collapse, fleeing towards Zhuanqiao in Shanghai County. The guerrillas took advantage of the situation to pursue from both sides. The Japanese army was unable to stand still, so they rushed straight to Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai along the Shanghai-Min Road. At that time, they abandoned a lot of guns, ammunition, and baggage, and the guerrillas gained an unexpected harvest. Yesterday, they began to clear up the fake "self-defense corps" on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road.

Japanese Naval Bombardment of Zha Port Two small Japanese warships, carrying dozens of naval marines, sailed to the vicinity of Zha Port in southern Huangpu and indiscriminately fired cannons at the town. Houses far and near were shaken. More than a dozen residents of the town who did not have time to escape were killed, and all the houses were turned to ashes.

Guerrilla Attack on Dujiagang After several tug-of-war battles, most of the merchants and people in Dujiagang moved away, and it has become a dead market. The guerrillas of the Li Zhiming unit suddenly advanced to the area the night before last (the 17th). The naval marines of the Japanese army stationed there heard the alarm and immediately fired dense guns and cannons at the shore. The Li unit was divided into two units, one attacking the back of the Japanese army and encircling the Japanese army on land, and the other scattered along the coast to resist the Japanese navy. They fought back and forth for one or two hours before the Li unit withdrew to its original defense. After investigation, dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded, and four members of the Li unit were killed or wounded.

Japanese Army Demolished Houses in Shangchuan The war in the three counties of Pudong, Fengnan, and Chuan has been quite fierce recently. The Japanese army believed that guerrillas were hiding in the houses along the Shangchuan Railway. Yesterday (the 18th), they transferred more than 200 engineers to demolish the houses along the road one after another. When the residents heard the news, they were all panicked.

### Japan's Foreign Trade Encountered Setbacks

Imports Exceeded Exports in the First Ten Days of This Month, Mainly Due to a Sharp Decline in Exports

Continental News said that in the first ten days of this month, Japan's foreign trade encountered setbacks, with imports exceeding exports by 12,792,000 yen. So far this year, Japan's imports have also increased by 8,986,000 yen compared with the same period last year, mainly due to the increase in imports of groceries, wool, papermaking raw materials, and raw cotton. During the same period, Japan's main export, cotton fabrics, was less than the export during the same period last year.

### The Fudan Alumni Association Celebrates Ma Xiangbo's Centenary Birthday Yesterday

More than 500 alumni and guests attended, including Yu Qiaqing and Lin Kanghou, who also came to offer their congratulations.

The event was unprecedentedly grand. First, the chairman, Ye Jichun, expressed his gratitude, followed by Jiang Yiping reading a congratulatory message. After the dinner, an annual meeting was held, and the event concluded joyfully at around 10 p.m.

Agenda of the Meeting: (1) Opening; (2) Chairman's Speech; (3) Birthday Greetings; (4) Dinner; (5) Annual Meeting; (A) School Song; (B) Speeches; (C) Report on Association Affairs; (D) Report on the Recent Situation by Representatives of the Alma Mater; (E) Discussion; (F) Entertainment; (G) Raffles; (H) Adjournment.

Chairman's Speech: Chairman Ye Jichun said in his congratulatory speech, "Today is the 100th birthday of Elder Ma Xiang, and the Fudan Alumni Association is holding a celebration in particular. We are deeply honored by the presence of all the guests. Mr. Ma's birthday is the gengzi year of the Daoguang reign, which according to the lunar calendar is February 17th, and according to the Gregorian calendar is March 19th, 1940. Everyone present here today must be very happy. It is rare to hear of someone living to be a hundred years old. We only hear of old people in the countryside who do not ask about worldly affairs and live a life of peace and contentment to reach one hundred years old, but even that is rare. However, Elder Xiang lived to be a hundred years old, and he did not only care for himself. He is always doing things for society. This is truly unprecedented. Perhaps you doubt the words 'unprecedented,' but in China's more than 4,000-year history, although there have been people who lived to be a hundred years old, it is very rare for famous people to live to be a hundred years old. We are now participating in an unprecedented grand event, and we are truly very honored."

Xia Jinguang's Thank You Speech: Xia Jinguang, representing the Ma family, said in his thank you speech, "Today I am very honored to participate in Ma Shou's birthday as a guest. When I met Mr. Ma, he was already in his sixties. At that time, he was running Fudan Public School. I had no experience in education, and Mr. Xiangbo guided me in everything. For the sake of the school, he struggled tirelessly and created today's Fudan, full of talented people, all of whom he cultivated. Today, I am very grateful for everyone's presence and extend my infinite gratitude on behalf of Elder Xiang."

Holding the Annual Meeting: Finally, the alumni association meeting was held, reporting on association affairs, discussing action plans, and adding wonderful entertainment to liven up the atmosphere. In addition, each participant received a pair of longevity bowls, a commemorative medal, and supplies donated by various manufacturers, and everyone was beaming with joy. The event concluded joyfully at around 10 p.m.

### The Fake "Chinese Workers Welfare Association" Performs a Farce in Hongkou

They Actually Established a So-Called "Workers Self-Defense Corps," Luring Thugs to Join, Almost Resulting in Violence. Traitor Fu Xiaoan Actually Attended to "Admonish" Them

In order to attempt to manipulate the Shanghai workers' movement and expand the power of the people for their own use, the Japanese and puppet authorities previously initiated the organization of the fake "Chinese Workers Welfare Association." Hu Shouchang, the fake "Director of the Social Bureau," served as chairman, and a Japanese named Kyubota Noboru served as advisor. Long Xiangshan's younger brother from Hubei, using the alias Lin Zijing, served as secretary-general. They attracted some idlers and labor brokers, fabricated the names of labor unions, falsely reported the list of workers, sang their own praises, and fraudulently received subsidies from the Japanese side. Therefore, although the "establishment" of the association has been more than half a year, because the labor unions of various industries in this city unanimously refused to cooperate, the content is empty and there is no real strength. Recently, under the instruction of the Japanese side, they organized a "Workers Self-Defense Corps," which was declared "established" yesterday. The fake "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan went to "admonish" them. Lin and others sent out thugs in advance to attract people, claiming that all participants would be picked up by special cars and would receive a subsidy of two yuan per person. Hearing this, some idlers gathered many thugs and loafers and gathered in the Tianhou Palace at 8:00 a.m. yesterday. They wrote the names of "various labor unions" on white cloth banners, and each participant was wrapped in a white cloth armband. There were about 500 people, posing as members. At about 8:00 a.m., the "Welfare Association" sent a car to take them to Hongkou Park to line up. At about 10:00 a.m., the fake "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan arrived and climbed a small grave to "admonish" them. Then Kyubota Noboru gave a speech. Because the location was desolate, no one heard what wonderful arguments he made. At 12:00 p.m., the meeting was announced to be over, and the "Welfare Association" distributed a bag of food to each person and ordered them to walk back. In general, participants were very dissatisfied. After arriving at the Tianhou Palace, they asked Lin for the two yuan subsidy, but Lin broke his promise and did not pay. Therefore, a violent conflict almost broke out. The whole farce is truly laughable.

### Twelve Chinese Customs Officers Transferred to Work in Wenzhou

To Place Japanese Foreign-Class Customs Officers, Chinese Customs Officers Were Squeezed Out

Jianghai Customs had previously employed a large number of Japanese customs officers and assigned them to work in internal and external classes. It is now heard that in order to continue to place Japanese foreign-class customs officers, the customs authorities have decided to transfer twelve Chinese foreign-class customs officers to Wenzhou Customs to continue working. It is said that the monthly salaries of the twelve customs officers are around two or three hundred yuan, and they are quite responsible. Now, in order to obey orders, they have scheduled to leave Shanghai for Wenzhou by boat tomorrow (the 21st). It is learned that after the twelve customs officers arrive in Wenzhou, they will still be responsible for foreign-class work and will be paid their original salaries.

### Downstream Ports of the Yangtze River Blockaded by Japanese Troops, 15 Fake Checkpoints Have Been Set Up

In Order to Seize Exclusive Control of Yangtze River Shipping, the Japanese Troops Blockaded Most of the Downstream Ports and Set Up Fake Checkpoints in Various Ports Below Zhenjiang to Collect Taxes on Goods. The Blockaded Ports Are Generally Blockaded with Giant Ships Directly Aground, or Woven with Giant Bamboo, to Block the Ports, Making It Difficult for Ships to Enter and Exit. A Few Days Ago, a Fake Policeman in Zhangjiagang Reverted to Righteousness, Killing Two Japanese Soldiers and Throwing Their Bodies into the Yangtze River. The Japanese Troops Tried Their Best to Salvage Them, But They Have Not Been Found Yet, and They Threatened to Burn Houses in Shazhou to Vent Their Anger. At Luojiaqiao in Jiangbei, Chinese Troops Attacked the Fake Checkpoints. All the Japanese Troops in Zhangjiagang Crossed the River. The Chinese Troops Have Gone Elsewhere. Now, Along the River, Starting from Huangtiangang in Jiangyin, Such As Hupu, Baimao, Tianshenggang, Renjiagang, Qiyakou, Baxigang, Xiagang, Zhangjiagang, Yanglingang, Liuhekou, Shiyixigang, Qinglonggang, Niuhonggang, and Xingang, There are Fifteen Fake Checkpoints Set Up to Collect Taxes and Donations. Each Chicken and Duck Must Donate Twelve Cents, and Rice, Grain, Cattle, and Pigs Must All Pay Donations. As a Result, People Are Living in Poverty and Filled with Resentment.

### The French Concession Taxpayers' Association Prepares for Re-election

Because the Terms of the Current Chinese Directors, Committee Members, and Supervisory Committee Members of the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association are About to Expire, the Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting Was Convened Last Time to Discuss the Re-election, But the Meeting Was Adjourned Due to Insufficient Number of People. It Has Now Been Decided that the Standing Committee Members Will Discuss It and Then Prepare for the Re-election, So As to Elect Members to Attend Various Committees of the Public Works Bureau to Promote Various Facilities in the French Concession.

### The "Hana" Sailed For the First Time, Specially Loaded with Fresh Fish to Shanghai

Cargo Transportation Between Shanghai and Ningbo Was Slack, and Tangbei Did Not Intend to Join. The Yin County Government Ordered Various Shipping Companies to Fill Out Employee Reports

The Zhejiang Provincial Military Authorities Previously Strengthened Coastal Defense to Prevent Strong Young Men from Leaving the Country, So Except for Wenzhou, Haimen, and Ningbo, Which Were Designated as Ports of Call, Dinghai, Shipu, Xiangshan, and Other Places Were All Blockaded, Prohibiting Foreign Ships from Sailing. Therefore, Transportation Between Shanghai and Dinghai Was Cut Off, and More Than Three Months Have Passed Since Then. Although Various Parties Have Requested Repeatedly, It Has Not Been Approved. Now, the Ningbo Defense Headquarters, in Response to the Request of Dinghai Fish Merchants, Has Stipulated Five Measures and Approved the Employment of Hana and Haifu Ships to Load Fresh Fish to Shanghai, But Passengers Are Absolutely Prohibited. Now, the Hana Ship Is Scheduled to Sail from Shanghai to Ningbo This Afternoon at 4:00 P.M., Turn to Dinghai, and Then Load Fresh Fish and Return Directly to Shanghai. As for the Haifu Ship, It Is Currently Sailing to Wenzhou and Must Wait Until It Arrives in Shanghai to Determine the Sailing Date.

Minhe Approved to Sail to Ningbo Once: The Ningbo Defense Command received a report from Yufengheng Tax Firm and Fuji Firm, stating that their firms' manager, Fujihang, had approximately seven thousand pieces of various goods, including tinfoil, green oil, leather oil, mat grass, gold thread hats, medicinal materials, porcelain, tobacco leaves, and photo frames. These items have been piled up for a long time, causing difficulties in financial turnover. They have already applied to the Chamber of Commerce and the Property Adjustment Office for approval to export these goods and have been issued a certificate. These miscellaneous goods urgently need to be transported to Shanghai for sale, as they are crucial to their livelihoods. Therefore, they propose to hire the registered and approved Minhe steamship to transport the goods to Shanghai in two shipments. The command, after checking that the reported inventory was not much, specifically approved the Minhe ship to transport the goods to Shanghai in one shipment.

Tangbei Does Not Intend to Join Sailing to Ningbo: The Tangbei ship of the Huamei Shipping Company, a US merchant in this city, originally sailed on the Shanghai-Taiwan route. After Haimen was harassed by Japanese warships and obstructed from resuming sailing, the ship changed to the Shanghai-Wenzhou route. Recently, the Ningbo Defense Command approved it to sail on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, but the company's authorities believed that the cargo transportation between Shanghai and Ningbo was slack, and the business was deserted. Moreover, the company's Tangsai had already joined the sailing, so the Tangbei ship temporarily did not intend to sail to Ningbo and continued to sail on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route.

Shipping Companies Submit Employee Reports Today: Yesterday, various shipping companies in this city received instructions from the Ningbo Shipping Association, which was forwarded by the Yin County Government, stating that the total number of crew members, buyers, and sailors (including all personnel on board) of each ship sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo line should be investigated and registered in detail to prevent impersonation and false pretenses. The notice required shipping companies to submit lists of their buyers and sailors, including their names, native places, ages, genders, the months and years they have worked on the ship, their positions, their levels of education, and their home addresses, along with two photos each. These lists should be compiled by the association and submitted to the government for review. The progress of the process should also be reported to the government for record. The association yesterday sent letters to various shipping companies, requesting them to prepare the lists of buyers and sailors, along with two photos each, within five days and submit them to the association for compilation and submission.

### Hoarders Deliberately Cause Panic, Affecting the Rice Market

The Price Evaluation Committee Will Strictly Crack Down

Since the Rice and Bean Industry and other seven groups jointly formed the Rice and Grain Price Evaluation Committee, stipulating that the limit price should still be 14 yuan, the price of rice has gradually returned to normal due to the steady arrival of goods. The highest quality rice has returned to 14 yuan, which meets the limit price. However, since the day before yesterday, the price has risen again. The price of special japonica rice has risen to more than 14 yuan, and the market has suddenly become chaotic. According to people in the rice industry, the reason for this sudden increase is that the market is filled with rumors that Changshu, Wuxi, and Wuhu are banning the export of rice. At the same time, the dangerous situation in Europe and the tense situation in this city also have an impact. However, these are all deliberate scare tactics by hoarders who intentionally spread rumors. In fact, it is all false, because the arrival of goods is still steady and there is no ban on transportation. The Rice and Grain Price Evaluation Committee has previously stipulated measures to punish unfair trading and will severely crack down on this dark market.

### The New Asia Hotel Has Not Been Leased, But Has Been Clearly Occupied

The Person in Charge of the Hotel in Hong Kong Has Issued a Firm Statement

The Zi Lin Bao reported that the rumor that the owner of the New Asia Hotel in Shanghai and a previous operator had leased the hotel to a certain Japanese company has been firmly denied by a person in charge of the New Asia Hotel in Hong Kong. It is said that since August 1937, the New Asia Hotel in Shanghai has been closed due to the war, and all responsible personnel have left Shanghai. The hotel's business office moved to Hong Kong many months ago. He is certain that the hotel's landlord or representative has never engaged in any kind of consultation with the Japanese side.

### Japanese and Puppet Authorities Withhold 150 Million in Customs Duties

Unilaterally Changing Tax Rates Benefits Japan, Hitting British and American Businesses

The Japanese and puppet authorities seized the customs offices in North China and Shanghai, and the customs revenues of each office were withheld and deposited in the Japanese-owned Zhengjin Bank. They also unilaterally modified the tax rates to benefit Japan, which affected the trade of various countries with China. The administration of various customs offices in the occupied areas was completely destroyed. Details are as follows:

Unilaterally Reducing Tax Rates Benefits Japan: China's independent tariff movement has undergone many difficulties. Through the efforts of the authorities, it was successfully achieved in the 19th year of the Republic. Unexpectedly, this hard-won tariff autonomy was destroyed by the seizure by the Japanese and puppet authorities. Now, the four northeastern provinces have been cut off as the puppet "Manchukuo." After the customs offices in North China were seized, the puppet organization announced new tax rules and abolished the 2.5% surtax. The tax rates on 254 kinds of goods were modified. On the import side, wheat and flour were tax-free, and the tax rates on seafood, textiles, and mineral sands were reduced. On the export side, cotton was tax-free, and the tax rates on wool were reduced.

150 Million Yuan Was Withheld: The portions of customs duties that should have been allocated for debt compensation from the customs offices in the three northeastern provinces have never been paid since those offices were seized in the 21st year of the Republic. Other customs offices, except for Jianghai Customs, which paid once in June of the 27th year, have also never paid. The customs duties withheld in the 27th year were as follows: Tianjin Customs: 56.94 million yuan; Jiaozhou Customs: 8.87 million yuan; Qinhuangdao Customs: 4.54 million yuan; Dongguan Customs: 4.02 million yuan; Jianghai Customs: 83.78 million yuan. The total amount was about 158.15 million yuan in national currency.

Trade of Various Countries Affected: The trade of Britain, the United States, Germany, and France with China has been sharply reduced since January of the 27th year of the Republic due to the seizure of the customs offices in the occupied areas of China by the Japanese and puppet authorities and the unilateral modification of tax rates. However, Japan's trade with China has jumped to the first place in Chinese trade due to its use of special forces. For example, last year, the trade of various countries with China was as follows: Japan: 326.41 million yuan; the United States: 238.1 million yuan; Germany: 169.37 million yuan; Britain: 127.37 million yuan; France: 43.16 million yuan.

### Children's Organizations Prepare to Celebrate Children's Day

Please Ask Various Radio Stations to Increase Celebration Programs, Parks Open, Hospitals Provide Free Medical Treatment

This year's April 4th Children's Day has been prepared for celebration by the Children's Day Preparatory Committee jointly organized by the Public Concession Bureau of Public Works Children's Protection Section, China Child Welfare Association Shanghai Branch Office, Shanghai Children's Hope Care Association, Shanghai YMCA, YWCA, Women's Temperance Association, and other organizations. The association has sent a letter to various radio stations in this city for Children's Day celebration programs, and has begun soliciting Children's Day essays (limited to 500 words per article), planning to issue Children's Day special publications in various newspapers. It is learned that the association has also sent letters to the authorities of the two concessions, requesting that the French Park and Zhaofeng Park be opened on Children's Day so that children's organizations can visit freely. The association has also negotiated with major hospitals to provide free medical treatment for children on Children's Day, expressing the utmost care for children. And in order to facilitate the investigation by the authorities of the two concessions, the preparatory committee hopes that all charitable organizations and shelters that plan to hold garden parties on that day can inform them of the number of children visiting and the route they will take before the 28th, so that they can report to the police station. In addition, the association has begun collecting Children's Day gifts to distribute to children in charitable organizations and shelters. The collection locations are as follows: (1) Children's Day Preparatory Committee, No. 33 Wangjiasha Huayuan Road, (2) YMCA, No. 599 Sichuan Road, (3) YWCA, No. 999 Jingansi Road, (4) Moore Memorial Church, No. 316 Yu Qiaqing Road, (5) Children's Care Association, No. 451 Dagu Road (Inside Shanghai Women's University).

The Fake "Municipal Government" Operating Tax:

Extremely Exploitative

Ruthless Exactions, Penetrating Every Hole: After the fake "Shanghai Municipal Government" stopped collecting the fake "Consumption Tax" last month, the lifeline of money was cut off, and it fell into a difficult situation that could not be maintained, so it actively invented new "taxes," ruthlessly exploiting them to make up for the deficit. Starting from April, it resolutely disregarded everything and started collecting the fake "Operating Tax." The fake "Tax Standard Tax Rate Table" and the fake "Provisional Classification Tax Rate Table" were published yesterday, with many items, penetrating every hole, and extremely exploitative. At present, there are only a few shops with small capital in the suburbs of Shanghai. After this harsh "tax" is exploited, it will be difficult to maintain operations. The fake "tax rate" is copied as follows: (A) Fake "Operating Tax Standard Tax Rate Table," (1) (Pawnshop Industry) Tax rate of two thousandths, based on the standard of business volume. The business volume in this item refers to the principal amount of the pawn; (2) (Pawnshop Industry) Tax rate of three thousandths; (3) (Forwarding Industry, Laundry Industry) ten thousandths; (4) (Transportation Industry, Construction Industry, Painting and Brushing Industry, Warehousing Industry, Water and Electricity Industry, Well Drilling Industry, Customs Declaration Industry, Securities Industry, Bath Industry, Washing and Dyeing Industry, Hairdressing Industry, Restaurant Industry, Pastry Industry, Noodle Industry, Packing and Boxing Industry, Real Estate Leasing Industry, Decoration Industry, Guanguan Industry, Restaurant Industry, Cooked Food Industry, Printing Publishing and Books Stationery Education Supplies Industry) twenty thousandths, (5) (Auction Industry, Western Restaurant Industry, Dairy Industry, Photography Industry, Flower and Tree Industry, Ivory Bone Industry, Hotel Industry, Gold and Silver Jewelry Utensils Industry, Gold Shop Industry) Twenty Thousandths, (6) (Manufacturing Industry) Ten to Twenty Thousandths, (7) (Money Shop Industry, Silver Shop Industry) Five Thousandths, (B) Fake "Operating Tax Provisional Classification Tax Rate Table" (1) Banks and Money Shops: Taxed annually at five thousandths of the amount of capital, collected monthly, (2) Grocery Stores: Tax rate of ten thousandths, based on the standard of business volume (including grain, firewood, charcoal, kerosene, salt, matches, mountain goods, local goods, candles, soap, cotton, forest products, sauce gardens, shoes, socks, hats, silk cocoons, mineral sands, sand and gravel, flying flowers, yarn heads, hemp, clothing boxes, combs, yarn, yellow and white wax, plaster, real estate, hair, bristles, hair, horns, bones, clothing, (3) Consumption Tax Rate fifteen thousandths (including sexual intestines, cotton fabrics, hemp fabrics, paper, oil, bamboo, wood, zong, rattan, bricks, tiles, lime, medicine, tea shoots, old goods, steel utensils, ceramic materials, enameled utensils, straw woven products, tea, lacquer, North-South goods, copper tin lead utensils, fans, pickled fish, eggs, chemicals, chickens, ducks, beef, mutton, fruits, fish row, smoked meat, vehicles, groceries, seafood, cement, pigments, western goods, hardware, rice milling, oil extraction, shipbuilding, sawing wood, metallurgy, kiln utensils, coal balls, tea rolling, blankets, box making, binding, brushing emperor, dyeing, printing, clothing making, boiling, meat oil, lamp making, egg yolk, white sugar, thermos bottles, buttons, alkali making, colored eggs, electrical appliances, copper plating, celluloid, articles, storage batteries, electrical appliances, ice making, eyeglass frames, tin foil, silver spraying, seasonings, film production, rubber articles, glass, western medicine, rubber, water and electricity materials, longan, department stores, wool fabrics, game, candy, tea food, canned food, ham, incense candles, firecrackers,

### Tomorrow is the Shanghai Restoration Memorial Day

All Sectors Will Fly Flags to Commemorate, Various Schools Will Lecture on the History of the Restoration

Tomorrow is the Fake Shanghai Local Memorial Day. At that time, various institutions, public organizations, businesses, schools, and households in this city will all fly flags to commemorate the event. In the past, various schools would also have a day off on this day. Now, because it is a time of national crisis, with the students' studies as the main priority, most have stopped taking days off and are holding classes as usual. However, they will hold memorial meetings separately and lecture on the history of the local restoration to encourage students.

### Yugoslav Residents Without Consular Protection

Appeal to France to Take Responsibility for Handling, Czech Residents Are Under German Responsibility

The Continental Daily News reports that as a result of Hitler's recent invasion of land, a small number of Yugoslavs residing in Shanghai, about fifty or sixty people, felt anxious yesterday (the 18th). Before Hitler completely annexed Czechoslovakia, the Czech residents in China were represented by the Czech Minister Seba. Seba's official position has now been seized, so Shanghai's Yugoslavs have neither consular protection nor a representative. According to Pajic, chairman of the Yugoslav National Committee in this city, they have appealed to the Yugoslav capital to entrust France to take responsibility for handling the affairs of the Yugoslav residents in China. The French Consulate represents the Yugoslav residents in Vietnam and Sichuan and Yunnan provinces. At the same time, it was announced that the German Embassy here has assumed full responsibility for all Czech resident affairs. Although the personnel of the Czech Legation are still staying at the Legation at 727 Haig Road, they do not have any official status.

### Garages Along the Road

Prohibited from Being Converted into Living Rooms

The French Public Works Bureau Formulated Measures

Because the population of Shanghai has increased sharply, the French Concession Public Works Bureau has formulated four regulations on the use of garages, ordering owners to comply, in order to prevent the sub-landlords from building mezzanine floors and using garages for rent. The regulations are copied as follows: Article 1. It is strictly forbidden to use garages along the road as living rooms, workshops, shops, or warehouses. However, this rule does not apply to those who have applied to the French Public Works Bureau and have been approved. Article 2. All applications should be reviewed by the Board of Directors of the French Public Works Bureau and submitted to the Consul General for a decision. Article 3. The above permission is not of a permanent nature. If its neighbors or the Director General of the French Police Department raise reasonable objections, the Board of Directors of the French Public Works Bureau may adopt the opinions and revoke the permission at any time. Article 4. Anyone who violates these regulations shall be fined from five to one hundred yuan, and those living in the garage may be ordered to move out by the police station.

Four Associations of Iron Industry, etc.

The City Federation and the Women and Children Education and Care Institute Will Continue to Fundraise and Broadcast Today

The four associations of the iron industry, hardware industry, steel bar and old iron industry, and copper and tin industry in this city have previously decided to handle refugee donations, stipulating that one cent of refugee donation will be collected for every hundred catties. It has now been decided that it will be implemented tomorrow (the 21st). All donation books and receipts have been received from the Industry Promotion Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association yesterday. The association has always been enthusiastic about disaster relief work, and it is expected that there will be considerable achievements.

The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation Relief Refugee Committee broadcast a fundraising campaign for the Women and Children Education and Care Institute yesterday for the second day. Donations from all walks of life were very enthusiastic. Yesterday, committee members Zhang Yichen, Gu Yucang, and Wang Jingdong gave speeches on the radio. Today, it will continue to be held at the Washington Radio Station. The programs include Beiping comedy, Yue opera Shen opera, and stories, all of which are extremely exciting. All sectors are also welcome to request songs.

### Various Charity Organizations Organize Mobile Relief Team

To Undertake Relief, Medical Treatment, Burial for Refugees; To Depart for the Yangtze River Basin in Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei Provinces

Various charity organizations in this city, considering that since the outbreak of war in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, relief efforts have been difficult to implement due to transportation difficulties, and with the arrival of early spring, the work of refugee relief, burial of exposed corpses, and medical treatment for the poor and sick are urgently needed, it is heard that all parties have now agreed to jointly organize a mobile relief team composed of various charity organizations in this city, selecting competent staff to undertake various relief tasks. Once the organization is ready, it can depart. The destinations are said to include areas along the Yangtze River in the four provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei.

French Military Commander in Shanghai

To Relinquish Post Periodically

Colonel Granié to Succeed

The Shanghai Times reports that Colonel Bourgeois, the French military commander in Shanghai, has served for nearly three years. His successor, Colonel Granié, is coming to Shanghai from Vietnam and is expected to arrive on Tuesday. Before leaving office, Colonel Bourgeois plans to take a short vacation in Japan and is scheduled to depart at the end of this week. After returning to Shanghai, he will formally hand over the command, at which time a grand ceremony will be held. All units of the French army in Shanghai will be present, and senior officials from diplomatic and consular offices may also participate. Colonel Bourgeois arrived in Shanghai in 1936 to serve as the French military commander.

### Large Shipment of Quinine to China; Gift from the American Red Cross to Refugees

Anticipating Severe Malaria Epidemic This Summer; To Be Unloaded in Hong Kong

The Continental Daily reports that a member of the American Advisory Committee in Shanghai told reporters yesterday (the 18th) that the American Red Cross has donated two million tablets of quinine to Chinese refugees, which have now been shipped to China. He believes that the Chinese Red Cross, which is actively fighting malaria and other diseases in the mainland, has appealed for donations of medicines. The committee member explained that due to the influx of refugees suffering from malaria into the mainland, the disease is rapidly spreading from one area to another. Therefore, a severe malaria epidemic is expected this summer. To distinguish the medicine, all tablets are colored blue. The boxes are also labeled to indicate that the tablets inside are donated by the American Red Cross. They will be unloaded in Hong Kong and then transported to the mainland by the Chinese Red Cross. As for the crushed wheat recently shipped to China by the American Red Cross, there are still about nine thousand bags left here. Chinese refugees enjoy eating it, and even the poor people in South China who are accustomed to eating rice have repeatedly requested continued donations.

### North-Sha Route Extremely Prosperous

Chinese Troops Stationed at Various Ports; Foreign Ships Sail Frequently

The inland ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have been under Japanese control. Regulations stipulate that foreign ships must obtain navigation permits before sailing. Most foreign merchants refuse to cooperate and have announced the suspension of navigation. Inland merchants have also ceased doing business due to the Japanese puppet regime's control over exports, requiring export permits, and the illegal collection of taxes at various ports, which are unbearable. They have switched to transporting goods through ports stationed by Chinese troops. Therefore, ports such as Beisha, Songji Port, Sanhe Port, Hutong Port, Niuhong Port, Shuji Port, Da'an Port, Laohong Port, Xingang Port, Lingxun Port, and Dongyi Port, which are still under the control of the puppet guerrillas, have become the central points for the transfer of inland cargo. Foreign shipping companies have dispatched ships to sail frequently. According to investigations, there are more than ten foreign ships sailing, including Yihe, Tonghe, Deyao, Daxin, Lisha, Haiyi, Sanbei, and Hongyun, with five or six ships traveling back and forth daily. The Beisha route has now become the most prosperous route in the inland ports. Although the Xingang route is still operating as usual, the number of passenger and freight ships has sharply decreased, with only seven or eight ships sailing.

Puppet Ye Dingxin

Plots to Become Puppet "Vice Minister"

It has been learned that Ye Dingxin, the chief of the general affairs department of the puppet Provisional Government's Ministry of Industry, who previously came to Shanghai to organize a puppet trademark bureau, is now seeking to become the puppet Minister of Industry with the support of certain forces.

### Toxic Atmosphere Pervades Shanghai's Suburbs; Opium Dens Established Everywhere

Four More Added in Nanshi and Zhabei; Establishment of "Lida Company" to Materialize Soon

(Modern News Agency) Opium dealer Jiang Yumen, who was wanted by the Songhu Garrison Command for years due to his involvement in the red pill trafficking case, recently sneaked into Shanghai from Shantou and colluded with famous opium merchants Zheng Chuanying and Liu Zheran from Chaozhou, raising capital of 100,000 yuan to establish a general bureau for selling opium in western Shanghai, implementing a policy of poisoning the people. Its main office was originally located at No. 6 Xinkang Lane, Caojiadu. However, after receiving warnings from patriotic groups, it was immediately moved to Renhe Lane, Wujiaochang, to continue operating. Jiang and Liu serve as general and deputy managers, respectively, with a Mr. Li representing them in all negotiations. In addition to signing a contract with the Japanese to sell five large boxes of opium daily, they have recently established branches in Pudong, Hongkou, Nanshi, and Zhabei to facilitate the transportation of opium. All opium businesses in the occupied areas are now under their control. The toxic atmosphere is pervasive and intensifying, with no hope in sight for the people. Furthermore, opium dealers Zheng Chunhe and Guo Bosun also plan to establish a large-scale opium trafficking organization in western Shanghai. After several rounds of negotiations, they have made smooth progress and named it "Lida Company." It has a substantial capital, and the office is currently located in the Broadway Mansions in Hongkou. Once the procedures with certain parties are completed and a business license is obtained, it can be realized.

### Shanghai Refugee Relief Association (Continued) (Yesterday) Policies on Managing Shelters

It must be understood that refugees are not slaves, let alone prisoners. Refugees are people who have suffered during national crises, a general term for those who have suffered within war zones. The only difference is that there are refugees in shelters, refugees not in shelters, and even refugees like us serving in refugee shelters. Everyone must understand that refugees in shelters are not a different kind of people, but compatriots who stand in the same position as us. Therefore, the enthusiastic donations of people from all walks of life and our service to the majority of refugees are all about fulfilling our mutual assistance obligations. Even Westerners are doing their best to help us, let alone our own people.

Some things are heavier than Mount Tai, and some are lighter than a feather. The resignation of Mr. Cai and Mr. Wang a few days ago was indeed justifiable. The future work is indeed more important than the positions they resigned from. Moreover, both gentlemen had stated before coming here to work that they were only helping out temporarily. Therefore, the farewell ceremony was very grand, not only to respect the two gentlemen but also to encourage colleagues to work hard. Unexpectedly, after Cai and Wang, anyone who has other work immediately resigns, regardless of whether they are responsible or whether someone else can take over. Now there is Zhang Yiyi, who, while serving in the shelter, was reprimanded and recorded for abusing refugees and disobeying the director's orders after investigation. Last night, he left without permission and went to other places. The contents of the letter he left behind are even more unreasonable. Such irresponsibility and disobedience will not lead to good results even if he works elsewhere. His unpaid monthly salary will be used as a donation to refugees as a warning to others. If anyone still intends to resign and take on other tasks, you must declare it today so that we can prepare for replacements as soon as possible. Otherwise, I cannot leave my job without permission. You must know that this shelter is not a place for you to rest temporarily, so we cannot allow you to come and go as you please.

Let's talk about the meager treatment first. As far as I know, compared with other shelters, our association is still relatively high. Those of you who have served in other shelters must know that.

### Murdering Superior Officers and Robbing Military Funds; Lawless, Heinous Crimes

Defendants Still Trying to Evade Responsibility, Proven True by Fellow Villagers; Jurong Bandit Gang Robbing Military Funds Case Concluded, Awaiting Sentence

New Fourth Army Division Commander Liang Zuocheng, a native of Guangdong, his sixteen-year-old son, and three guards were carrying 327,000 yuan in military funds in December of the previous year when they passed through Qiaoxiang Village, Jurong County, Jiangsu Province. They were murdered by local bandits (the ringleaders Da Yuanlin and five others have already been executed) and the military funds were robbed. The case was reported by a Chinese detective Shang Wu of the Huishi Police Department, who received a secret report from Chinese Constable No. 121, and the suspects were arrested in Hankou Road, Shanxi Road, and other places.

The Jurong bandits, except for Chen Qiaosheng, who was found to be innocent and released on bail, the remaining four, Dai Hongfu, Chen Heshang, Chen Bosheng, and Qiao Changjin, were sent to the First Special District Court. The Jiangsu High Court branch ruled that the case could be tried and interrogated. All details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng specially opened the Criminal Court No. 3 to conduct the trial, and police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that Detective Shang Wu of the Huishi Police Department was in court and could state the circumstances of the

arrest at that time, as well as the confessions of the defendants at the police station. According to Detective Shang, he received a report from Chinese Constable No. 121 that he first arrested the defendant Dai Hongfu on Hankou Road, who confessed to the other three defendants, Chen Heshang, Chen Bosheng, and Qiao Changjin, who were subsequently arrested. Chen Heshang once escaped in front of a barber shop in North Shanxi Road but was later apprehended. Dai Hongfu admitted at the police station that he plotted to

murder Division Commander Liang and received 150 yuan each after the money was obtained, but this money was not given by Village Chief Da Yuanlin, who instead ordered him to stand guard near Qiaoxiang Village. In court, the four defendants were ordered to be interrogated separately, but the defendants Dai Hongfu and others overturned their confessions at the police station and firmly denied them. According to Chinese Constable No. 121, before the incident, he went to the Xi Qing Chi Bathhouse in Jiujiang Road to take a bath. The bathhouse attendants Mai Baogen, Zhang Heshang, and Shen Zhigao said that their fellow villagers

Dai Hongfu and others had plotted to murder a division commander in Qiaoxiang Village, Jurong, and that he could report this to the police station. He said yes and accompanied the deceased Gao Binghui and Jia and other three attendants to report to the Huishi Police Department. Detective Shang arrested the defendants. He said that if he had been delayed by one more day, the suspects would have gone to a certain place in Yangzhou and would not have been arrested. In court, the three attendants Jia, Zhang, and Shen were called to testify and still stated the same. After the investigation, Dai Hongfu and Qiao Changjin swore they were innocent. The court ordered the start of arguments, and the police lawyer

Zhang Tianyin said

that the police department was prosecuting this case for robbery and murder, but the circumstances were still different. The defendants were large-scale bandits organized by Da Yuanlin, the village chief of Qiaoxiang Village, Jurong. They dared to murder national superior officers and rob military funds, which was lawless, heinous, and extremely sinful. He requested that the most severe punishment be imposed. Judge Huang ordered the four defendants Dai Hongfu and others to be returned to prison to await sentencing on a scheduled date.

### All City Taxi Drivers Refuse to Drive to Hongkou

Unanimously Indignant at Planned Murders; Eighteen Suspects Arrested in Qin Gongcheng Case

In the past ten days, taxi drivers Rong Dingshan, Zhu Linggen, and others from various taxi companies in this city have been killed in Hongkou, which is unspeakable. All the drivers of the Taxi Drivers' Amateur Association, although they make a living from their profession, how can they hide their indignation and be willing to be harmed in the face of this planned attack? Therefore, all the drivers of Tailai and Yunfei companies, in addition to mourning the deceased colleagues, have also made serious representations and unanimously refused to drive to Hongkou. The funeral for the late driver Zhu Linggen was held at the Public Funeral Home at the end of Jiaozhou Road and Changping Road at 8 am on the 20th. The burial will be held at 2 pm. It is hoped that all circles will sympathize.

The North China Daily News reports

that yesterday (the 18th), it was learned that a certain car of Tailai Automobile Company carried several passengers from a hotel on Nanjing Road to a certain place in Hongkou on Sunday, and was assassinated that night. Yesterday, all the drivers of Tailai Company refused to carry passengers to any place north of the Suzhou River. Although the drivers of Yunfei Automobile Company were still willing to cross the Suzhou River, by dusk, the reporter asked a certain member of the company, who said that if there were foreigners

wanting to go to Hongkou

and Yangshupu districts in the evening, the drivers should decide for themselves whether or not to take them. It is heard that after the drivers of Tailai Company learned that a certain driver of the company was assassinated in the car, they held a meeting, and the employees reached this decision. A meeting was held on Friday night, but no definite resolution was reached. However, a committee has been elected to study this issue and convey their opinions to the drivers yesterday morning. It was rumored last night that the drivers of Yunfei Company may also refuse to drive to Hongkou after Monday. The

circumstances of the murders

of the two taxi drivers were quite similar. First, a driver of Yunfei Company was strangled and his body was found on the 6th of this month in the garden of an empty house on Jilin Road. The stolen car was also found parked near the Xinya Hotel on Tiantong Road. In the second assassination case, the driver's body was found in a pile of rubble next to Donghanbi Road, and the stolen car was also found near the first place where the stolen car was found. A few days ago, it was said that this kind of assassination

was to intimidate

the drivers of American cars so that they would not dare to operate in Hongkou and other areas north of the Suzhou River. These areas have small cars operated by Japanese and Koreans. According to the North China Daily News, taxi driver Tai Gongcheng (transliteration), 41 years old, was assassinated. His body was found on an open space next to Dinghai Road on the morning of the 12th of this month. Regarding this case, it was learned from reliable sources that by Friday night (the 17th), the Yangshupu Police Department had arrested eighteen suspects. As for the names of the suspects and the nature of the suspicions for which they were arrested, it was still unknown yesterday, but it is believed that they are now

under interrogation.

When the taxi driver's body was found, there were traces of elm tree injuries on his head. According to the investigation, it is generally believed that the murderer had stolen the driver's car. As of late last night, what could be confirmed was that the stolen car had not been found. It is believed that the car has left Shanghai, and the police are continuing the investigation.

Failed to Cancel Engagement

### Man Requests Compensation for Damages

Appeal Judgment: Should Compensate National Currency 300 Yuan

Fan Qiupu, a native of Zhenjiang, who lives at No. 47 Hengmao Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Baxianqiao, French Concession, and is now a clerk at Zhongfu Coal Mine, is a Christian. He is 28 years old this year. In 1936, through a matchmaker's introduction, he engaged Ma Yuxian, a native of Yong who lived at No. 5 Bing'an Lane, Nanchujiaqiao, Alige Road (24 years old this year). At that time, both parties were engaged at the Jinlingchun Restaurant on Fujian Road, English Concession. Later, Ma Yuxian suddenly hired a lawyer to

publish in the newspaper, claiming that

this marriage was advocated by her parents and was not with her own consent. She wanted to cancel the engagement. On the one hand, the woman also asked the court to mediate and cancel the engagement. As a result, the mediation failed, and on the other hand, Fan Qiupu, last year, entrusted a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against Ma Yuxian to confirm the validity of the engagement. The case was finalized after three trials in the Second Branch of the High Court and the Supreme Court, and it was ruled that the engagement between the two parties was valid. However, Fan chose a day to welcome the bride, but the marriage could not proceed smoothly due to the woman's opposition. Fan Qiupu again filed a

claim for damages

against Ma Yuxian in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, seeking to recover damages of 1,000 yuan. The initial trial rejected the plaintiff's claim. Fan Qiupu, dissatisfied with the judgment, filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court. After the court summoned both parties and witnesses for trial, it announced the end of the debate. The main text of the judgment issued the day before yesterday stated that the original judgment was revoked, and the appellant's claim for the amount stated later against Ma Yuxian and the portion of the litigation costs were changed. The appellee Ma Yuxian should compensate the appellant with 300 yuan in national currency. The remaining appeals were rejected. The appellant should bear 70% of the first and second instance litigation costs, and the appellee should bear 30%.

### Car Transporting Opium Case; Hunting Down the Principal Offender

On the afternoon of the 15th, Chinese and Western detectives of the French Police Station seized a No. 245 public car transporting opium while checking pedestrians at the intersection of Julieda Road and Mai Sixiai Road. After taking Tongzhou native Wang Lemen, who was carrying opium, and the driver Qu Linqing, to the police station, according to their confessions, they continued to arrest accomplices Gu Zhengxiang, Zhang Rongjiang, Zhang Xiaogen, etc. It was found that the car belonged to the late Lou Ziyun, the former captain of the detective team of the Shanghai Police Station. The police station sent the arrested criminals to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention, investigation and re-interrogation, and an arrest warrant was issued for the fugitive Zhang Baocheng to be brought to justice. All the news has been recorded in this newspaper. It is now learned that the fugitive principal offender Zhang Shicheng's house is richly decorated and equipped with a telephone. Usually, transactions of opium are secretly negotiated on the phone. The police station has sent detectives to search and wait at his home to arrest him. It is hereby urgently attached to this correction to apologize for the previous report involving Liu Yunfang, i.e., Liu Ziyun, which was actually Lou Ziyun.

Car and Tram Collide

At about 1:30 pm yesterday, at Wangjiasha, Jing'an Temple Road, English Concession, a black-licensed car was driving east from the west. At that time, a tram was coming from the opposite direction. Due to the failure to avoid it, a collision occurred, and traffic was blocked for half an hour before it returned to normal.

### Guerrilla Team Posts Giant Notices Everywhere; Warning Opium Dens and Gambling Dens

If You Do Not Close Your Doors, All Will Be Bombed; Hollywood Gambling Den Bombing Injures Six

The North China Daily News reports that outside of Yelu and other areas in the Western District beyond the boundaries, the Japanese-controlled areas have been plastered with giant notices written by guerrillas and anti-Japanese elements with official red seals, stating that if opium dens, gambling dens, and flower association factories in the area do not close their doors, they will all be bombed. If this is not just intimidation, then bomb attacks and shootings will occur again in the Western District in the next few days. According to a Chinese resident in the Western District, the sea strike team in the area often goes to various shops, not to ask for donations, but to politely explain their legitimate responsibilities. It is also heard that many guerrillas are carrying guns and walking calmly on the road.

Increased Taxes, Successive Closures

The gambling dens on the roads built beyond the boundaries of western Shanghai all have business licenses issued by the Japanese. There are as many as twenty-five in western Shanghai. Each pays a daily protection fee of 150 yuan, euphemistically called entertainment venues. Sasaki is responsible for supervising the entertainment venues. It is heard that this license fee has now increased, divided into 200 yuan, 300 yuan, and 400 yuan, collected daily. The owners of various gambling dens, in view of the frequent occurrence of terrorist incidents recently, and the gamblers are now hesitant, and now they also increase the license fee, and the expenses are huge, and they cannot maintain it. Therefore, there are already several who have voluntarily closed down.

Hollywood Bombing Injures Six

Also, gambling dens in western Shanghai such as Hollywood, Rongsheng, and Guangsheng, etc., have received warning letters for several days, ordering them to close immediately, otherwise drastic measures will be taken. It is now learned that at 4 pm the day before yesterday (the 17th), when the Hollywood gambling den was "listing" and gamblers were enthusiastically gathering, a strong man suddenly came in and threw a hand grenade at the gambling table. It exploded immediately. The gamblers were unable to escape and six were injured by the bombing on the site. The puppet police station was reported to go to search and send the injured to a certain hospital for treatment. As for the strong man who threw the bomb, he had escaped in the chaos. The puppet police searched and found nothing. Also on the same day and at the same time, two strong men with weapons suddenly broke into the Guangsheng gambling den and tried to do something. When they were discovered, the two strong men immediately disappeared.

Opium and Gambling Dens on High Alert

In Caohjiadu and other places beyond the boundaries of Yelu in western Shanghai, gangsters use special forces to openly set up opium and gambling venues, poisoning the society. Recently, the owners of various opium and gambling dens and opium shops have received warning letters from the China Elimination of Traitors Corps and are terrified. Most of them are hiding elsewhere and living in seclusion, not daring to go to the opium and gambling dens and opium shops they set up. The puppet police station has also dispatched puppet police to strengthen security at the gates of various gambling venues and opium shops. Since the day before yesterday, newly established Japanese military police uniforms (newly established) puppet police, wearing knives and guns, have been dispatched to stand guard at the entrance of each gambling den or opium shop. On the one hand, the owners of opium and gambling dens have hired many burly men to protect the gambling venues.

### Father Chops Off Leg Bones of Sick Child

Eleven Born, All Completely Dead; Chopping Off Leg Bones So They Won't Be Reincarnated; Police Station Prosecutes for Murder

Cai Heshang (49 years old) and Cai Xu (48 years old), a couple from Jiangbei who live at No. 108, Alley 87, Kangnaot Road, chopped off the leg bones of their sick baby Cai Xiaoya (their own daughter, only 56 days old) with an ax on the open space behind the public toilet of the Shanghai Municipal Council near Wuding Road, Tokyo Road, at 3 pm on the 13th of this month. She died of her injuries and was arrested by the Gordon Road Police Station. Yesterday, they were prosecuted by the First Special Court for murder under Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Judge Huang Risheng took the seat to hear the case. The defendant Cai Heshang confessed, "I make a living as a rickshaw puller. Including the daughter who died now, I have given birth to eleven children in total, and none of them survived. We have a superstition in our hometown that children who cannot be raised are 'debt collectors.' If you don't use harsh methods against them, they will still be reincarnated. This child was only fifty days old when she was born, and she was sick. She saw a doctor every day. On the afternoon of the 13th, she died again. My wife was holding her in her arms and crying. I was very angry, so I took the body of this 'debt collector' to the open space on Tokyo Road and chopped off her right leg bone with an ax. Who would have thought that when I chopped down with an ax, she came back to life and was calling. I was very scared in my heart, suspecting that the 'debt collector' was showing up. I threw the ax at her body and ran back." At this point in the interrogation, the court turned to Cai Xu for questioning. The defendant was then ordered to be returned to custody, and the case was scheduled for re-interrogation on the 25th of this month when the autopsy report arrived.

### The Case of the Assassination of Tang Jiapeng: The Culprit Cannot be Found for Questioning

The Gu Zhuxuan Case Has Been Suspended

Gu Zhuxuan, an elderly man from Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, and head of the Jianghuai Fellow Villagers Association at the Tianchan Stage, was accused by Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui, the assassins of Tang Jiapeng, while they were in prison, of being an instigator. Consequently, the French Concession police arrested Gu on September 10th, the 24th year of the Republic [1935], and escorted him to the Second District Court's Criminal Tribunal. A public prosecution was initiated against him for the crime of instigating murder. The case was heard by the former Criminal Tribunal President, Wang Gangxu, who sentenced him to fifteen years of imprisonment.

Gu Did Not Accept the Verdict

And appealed to the Third High Branch Court. After the court's review, on June 26th, the 26th year of the Republic [1937], he was declared innocent. However, he was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment for opium use in prison, a sentence that was confirmed. After serving his sentence, he was released on bail for 15,000 yuan concerning the accusation of instigating murder. The French Concession police, regarding Gu's

Declaration of Innocence, expressed dissatisfaction and submitted a petition to the Third High Branch Court's Prosecutor's Office, requesting that they appeal to the Supreme Court on their behalf, seeking to punish Gu with the crime he deserved. After review by the Supreme Court, the original verdict was overturned in the summer of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], and the case was remanded to the Third High Branch Court for a new trial. After "August 13th" [the start of the Battle of Shanghai], the Third High Branch Court summoned him once and instructed him to await a scheduled date for

Further Questioning. It is now learned that because the accusers in the case, Zhao Guangfu, Zhang Tinggui, and others, were assigned to serve on the front lines from the Second Prison under the jurisdiction of Beixinjing when the Shanghai war broke out and have since disappeared, the case cannot proceed and has been suspended. The situation of the case being unable to proceed has been reported to the Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Court for verification. Furthermore, it is reported that the main suspect in the

Tang Jiapeng Assassination Case, Wang Xinggao from Funing, was initially sentenced to life imprisonment, but the second trial declared him innocent. After the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Third High Branch Court for a new trial, Wang was also released on bail for 20,000 yuan. The Third High Branch Court repeatedly summoned him without success and has confiscated the bail. It is rumored that Wang Xinggao has become a traitor and has been killed by guerrillas in Jiangbei.

Worker's Legs Severed

At approximately 7:45 PM last night, a worker-like Zhang Huichun was passing through the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Zhejiang Road when he was run over by a Route 9 public bus, resulting in the fracture of both legs. Bleeding profusely, he suffered severe injuries. The patrol police arrived after hearing the news and promptly used an ambulance to transport him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but his chances of survival are slim.

Apprentice Commits Suicide by Swallowing Smoke

Dong Qilin, a native of Chongming, is currently twenty years old and works at the Wuzhou Shoes and Hats Shop on Zhejiang Road, earning only three yuan a month. His family is extremely poor, and recently, he was inexplicably influenced and contemplated suicide. Yesterday afternoon, he secretly swallowed a large amount of weight-producing smoke to commit suicide. Later, his colleagues at the shop discovered this and called the patrol police at No. 98, who summoned an ambulance to transport him to Tongren Hospital for treatment.

Cultural Figures

Hold a Public Banquet for Ren Jinping and Yu Kongwo

Since Shanghai became an isolated island, many cultural figures have been diligently fulfilling their responsibilities. Recently, Ren Jinping, Mao Zipei, and Feng Mengyun of the press have taken positions at the Translation Report, Wenhui News, and other publications, respectively. Coinciding with Yu Kongwo of the News commencing his legal practice, their four friends, Fan Shucai, Lai Lansheng, Chen Tingchao, Lu Yifang, and others, initiated a public banquet for the four at the Tongxing Restaurant yesterday (the 19th) at 6:00 PM.

### Quentin Roosevelt Comes to China to Search for the Golden Monkey of Tibet and Collect Other Animal Specimens

According to the Continental News, Quentin Roosevelt, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Japan yesterday (the 18th). He will travel to Kunming and then Dali on Tuesday before entering Tibet to search for the golden monkey of western China and Tibet, as well as other animal specimens unique to the area. When interviewed by reporters yesterday, he stated that he was traveling alone and that all the materials he obtained would be displayed in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and two other museums, which are funding his trip. In addition to collecting animal specimens, he will also study the uncivilized ethnic groups of western China. He expects to return to Shanghai around the end of June. Mr. Roosevelt graduated from Harvard University and came to Shanghai with his mother during the war in 1937. His parents are also planning a trip to the Far East this year and may arrive in Shanghai before the end of June to welcome their son's return from his long journey.

### Gambling Den Owner Loses Money and Resorts to Infighting, Opening Fire

Gao Jingen, a 34-year-old native of Suzhou, residing at No. 64 Yong'an Lane, Difeng Road, in western Shanghai, was very friendly with Mr. Wang, the owner of the "Yongyuan Company" gambling den near Caojiadu. Before the den opened, Mr. Wang lacked capital, and Gao, due to his active involvement in illicit activities around Yong'an Lane, had some savings. Therefore, Wang persuaded Gao to become a partner. In addition, Gao lent Wang 700 yuan as Wang's capital. Unexpectedly, after the den opened, business was poor. Recently, due to the Huajun Special Operations Team actively cracking down and warning various gambling dens and opium dens to close down quickly or face punishment, most gamblers hesitated to visit, and the gambling dens became desolate, plummeting in business. The Yongyuan gambling den was particularly deserted and declining. Gao Jingen, witnessing his investment possibly becoming worthless, became anxious and went to Yongyuan around 7:00 PM yesterday to demand repayment of the loan from Wang. However, Wang denied it, claiming that the money was Gao's share of the capital. This led to a dispute between the two, and they roared at each other in the den's accounting room, refusing to yield. Unable to reach an agreement, they resorted to violence. Mr. Wang, seized by murderous intent, took out a concealed handgun and fired six shots at Gao. Fortunately, Gao dodged effectively and was only hit once in the right arm, allowing him to escape. However, still indignant, he reported the incident to the Concession police, who dispatched Chinese police officer No. 252 to send him to the hospital for treatment and to investigate the truth and pursue the culprit.

### Letter

To the Esteemed Editor, We are writing in response to a statement from our client, Ms. Zheng Songliangzhao, who has read the news article titled "Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law as Strangers: Elderly Woman Sues for Support" in your newspaper on January 15th. The article stated that Ms. Zheng has always had disagreements with her mother-in-law, Ms. Cheng, so Ms. Cheng, now over seventy years old, still lives separately at No. 74 Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao. Not only are the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law like strangers, but the three grandsons, following their mother's instructions, also do not know to offer filial piety. It also claimed that the daughter-in-law is wealthy but never provides any assistance. This is inconsistent with the facts. Ms. Zheng and her mother-in-law, Ms. Cheng, have always been harmonious. Since Ms. Cheng moved to Shanghai, eight years have passed. Besides personally visiting Ms. Cheng to inquire about her well-being, she has also instructed her children to visit their grandmother regularly to provide care. The claim of long-standing disagreements is not factual. Furthermore, after the death of the late Mr. Shunian, the land rent he left behind, besides the 196 piculs taken by Ms. Cheng as sustenance, included more than 200 piculs that were inherited and benefited from by Mr. Gongwu, Ms. Zheng's husband. After her husband's death, she has been living on this income. The expenses for daily necessities, food, clothing, and the children's education have been extremely difficult to manage. As for the inherited shops, most of them have experienced poor business after her husband inherited them and have closed down one after another within a year, resulting in no income. During this time of national crisis, rent collection has decreased, and the hardship is beyond description. Moreover, in mid-November of last winter, she jointly withdrew 14 mu of farmland from the safety deposit box with Ms. Cheng as a mortgage for 1,000 yuan for Ms. Cheng. The claim that the daughter-in-law is wealthy but never provides any assistance is also inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, we have been specially entrusted by your lawyer to make corrections in order to set the record straight. We hereby respectfully request that you publish this letter in the Letters to the Editor section. Sincerely, Attorney Peng Zhongjun, March 18th.

Dear Editor, I am writing regarding the news article published in your newspaper on the 18th, which stated that the sale of opium was requested by Zhang Baocheng, the owner of the Xiechang Fruit Shop at No. 400 Foch Road. My Xiechang Fruit Shop is entirely self-funded, with no partners, and I do not know Zhang Baocheng. Therefore, I am extremely surprised and fear that the public will misunderstand, which would greatly affect the reputation of my small business. I am writing to request a correction. Sincerely, Chen Yusheng, Xiechang Fruit Shop.

Dear Editor, I am writing regarding the news article about Cheng Linsheng published in today's local news section of your newspaper, which involved Chen Fumu. Chen is a progressive individual currently residing in Hong Kong who strongly supports the war effort and is highly respected for his leadership in society. I am writing to request that you correct the information in this section to avoid the spread of misinformation. Sincerely, Zhou Bogan, March 19th.

### Promoting the Children's One-Cent Donation Campaign

— Yucai

There are still 100,000 refugees in Shanghai. These 100,000 refugees rely on the efforts of the Refugee Relief Association to solicit donations to maintain their lives. Almost everyone knows and appreciates the Refugee Relief Association. But can the association itself succeed? It cannot succeed. The association is empty. Its success depends entirely on the enthusiastic donations of people from all walks of life in Shanghai. It requires all the people of Shanghai, with one heart and one mind, to contribute money and effort, and to care about the lives of the displaced. Only in this way can the association succeed. When we look at the association's published income and expenditure reports in the newspaper, we can see that the amount of donations is quite considerable. However, because there are so many people who need relief, the distribution is not very generous. The future is long, and how will it continue? This is a problem. The refugees are all our dear compatriots, and we should all stand up and take responsibility to solve their living problems.

April 4th is Children's Day, an annual event. This year is the eighth. In the past, there were grand celebrations every Children's Day. The Children's Day this year has also been initiated and prepared by various children's education organizations. I personally believe that the celebration ceremony can be simple, but we should take this opportunity to promote thrift and promote a one-cent relief campaign. Speaking of this, some people may misunderstand that the donations in schools are too heavy. Sometimes there is a one-yuan charity donation, sometimes there is a thrift and relief donation, and sometimes there is a one-cent relief donation. The economic conditions of the children are very ordinary. Where do they have so much surplus money? This sounds very good on the surface, but it is wrong after careful analysis. The one-yuan charity donation is only once. It is used as a production education fund for the displaced, and it is not necessarily forced to donate. The total number of students in all large, medium, and small schools in Shanghai is about 300,000, but the goal is only set at 100,000 yuan. This means that some of the poorer students are expected to be exempt from donating. Moreover, it is now the end of the result, and there will be no more one-yuan charity donations in the future. Thrift and relief donations and one-cent relief donations are two sides of the same coin, but the one-cent relief donation is more specific. It is not very difficult for a child to save one cent a day. We only need to look at the business situation of consumer cooperatives in many schools to see that children are fully capable of contributing a one-cent donation. Donating one cent per person per day is three cents per month. Thinking of the last time the citizens' group launched a fundraising campaign to adopt displaced people, knowing that donating two yuan per month can save one person's monthly living expenses, wouldn't two children be able to save one displaced person? "Many grains of sand make a tower, and many fox furs make a robe." This is absolutely correct. It looks like it is only one cent, but the effect is very great. Children of Shanghai, I believe you are all enthusiastic. Starting today, implement a one-cent donation campaign. 100,000 displaced people are eagerly expecting you.

### The Words of a Newspaper Vendor (Continued)

— Yuan Xiangsheng, Tenth Newspaper Vendor School

After getting the newspapers, I hurry to the bus stop on Connaught Road and Xiaoshadu Road to sell them. At that time, many gentlemen who worked in offices went to work, so business was not bad. However, sometimes it is inevitable that you will not be able to sell them all. When they are about to be sold out, you have to deliver the newspapers to the homes of subscribers. Your feet do not allow you to be lazy at all. What newspaper vendors hate the most is rainy days. Sometimes the weather is very good when you leave home. Unfortunately, when you get the newspapers to sell, it starts to rain heavily. You don't have an umbrella, so you undo the buttons on your body and put the newspapers in your chest. The ruthless raindrops hit you, and you are drenched all over. It is very uncomfortable. A weak body may catch a cold and get sick. If you walk faster on a rainy road, there is a real danger of slipping and falling. Therefore, it is inevitable that the time for delivering newspapers will be delayed. If you meet a good subscriber, they won't say anything. However, some impatient gentlemen will ask why the newspapers were delivered so late. They can't know the reason and the reason why several newspaper offices publish late. Really, sometimes the newspaper offices have to wait for news or other reasons until very late before they publish. This makes the newspaper vendors suffer. Not only do they have to run like a race on the road, but they also have to be blamed by the subscribers. Therefore, I think it would be good if the newspaper offices could publish the newspapers before 7:00 AM, because some subscribers don't know the reason why we deliver the newspapers late and think that the newspaper vendors are lazy. Because we are short of time, we don't have time to explain in detail, so we have to vaguely say that we will deliver them earlier tomorrow.

After delivering all the newspapers to the subscribers, your feet can finally get a chance to rest. The whole morning is spent in a hurry. It can also be said that you have spent a day as a newspaper vendor.

But there are also those who sell the evening newspapers together. Of course, you can earn more money, but you have to work harder physically. Newspaper vendors with large families have to work harder to maintain their family life. (The End)

### Talking about Czechoslovakia

— Reflection

Czechoslovakia has been established for twenty years. During the First European War, thanks to the leadership of Masaryk and the courageous struggle of the people, Czechoslovakia was created. It was really not easy. As a result of twenty years of hard work, Czechoslovakia can also be called a powerful country. Its industrial development and exquisite military industry are especially praised by the world. Therefore, when Czechoslovakia is mentioned, people immediately think of its products. Its prevalence can be imagined.

Czechoslovakia has a population of 14 million and a land area of 140,000 kilometers. It is a very small country. Its location is between Germany, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and other countries. It borders the strong neighbor Germany and is adjacent to Hungary, Romania, Poland, and other countries. Therefore, the prosperity of Czechoslovakia could have increased the courage of small and weak nations. However, it is inevitable that it will be envied by strong neighbors. When Germany and Italy tried every means to expand their power in Europe, Czechoslovakia had already been considered a piece of fat. In addition to the fact that many lands were ceded to Germany, Hungary, and Poland last year, the problem of the declaration of independence by the Slovak Province and the Carpathian Ukraine Province has caused disintegration. The remaining provinces of Bohemia and Moravia have been occupied by Germany, so Czechoslovakia has been broken and fallen.

This incident originated from the disputes between the Slavic ethnic group and the Czech ethnic group. There are many Slavic ethnic groups living in the Slovak Province of Czechoslovakia. This ethnic group and the soldiers' living habits are incompatible, and conflicts often occur. After Germany annexed the Sudetenland, it helped the Slavic ethnic group to carry out an independence movement in Czechoslovakia, wanting to first make the Slavic Province and Carpathian Province become German vassals, and continue to pave the way for the eastward advance and attack the Soviet Union. Unexpectedly, the facts were beyond expectations. Under German pressure, Czechoslovakia allowed the Slovak Province and the Carpathian Province to become independent, and even asked Germany to protect the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia. Therefore, the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia were immediately allowed to be driven straight in by the German army and declared dissolution. When the news came, the world was shocked.

Czechoslovakia has fallen, but the fall of Czechoslovakia did not fire a shot or spend a bullet, which is sad. We believe that the fall of Czechoslovakia was due to Britain and France, because the British and French governments repeatedly tolerated aggression in order to seek temporary peace, which made Czechoslovakia unable to recover. It not only fueled the arrogance of fascism, but also backfired, harming others and not benefiting themselves. It is really a pity. But Czechoslovakia itself is also to blame for not adhering to its own position and relying on others to mediate. If Czechoslovakia had taken the initiative to strengthen its spirit, unite the people, and fight to the death before the Four-Power Conference, the result would not necessarily have been the fall of the country. Even if it was defeated and destroyed, it would have paid a considerable price, which would have been more colorful compared to the current situation of swallowing its breath. Moreover, the war might not have led to the destruction of the country.

Scientific Experiment

### An Interesting Toy

— Xiaohong

Now let me introduce an interesting toy. This toy is not my creation. It is extracted from books. However, this toy is related to optics. Understanding the mystery of it can let us know the mystery of light and vision. Although it is not an important thing, it is just a toy, but it contains scientific truth. Readers may wish to study it carefully.

Cut a small round piece of cardboard, about two inches wide and three inches long, and draw an object on each side. For example, draw a birdcage on the front of the paper and a bird on the back, and then tie a string to each side of the round paper. Now use your fingers to twist the string to make the round paper rotate rapidly, and the bird will be seen in the cage (see figure). This experiment is very interesting. If students are interested, they can do it according to this. Not only can it be used as a toy, but it can also arouse students' interest in research. It is also strange that it is clearly a bird on one side and a cage on the other. The two are unrelated things. After a few degrees of movement, the bird will get into the cage. Isn't it a strange thing? However, if you study its reason, it is not difficult to discover its scientific mystery, because when we usually look at things with our eyes, the image of the object is reflected on the retina of our eyeballs. At this time, if you suddenly move the object away, the image does not disappear immediately, but can be temporarily retained on the retina. This phenomenon is called "afterimage" in science. When the paper is rotating, the cage image that remains on our retina has not had time to disappear, and the bird image is immediately reflected on the retina, so the result is that the two are superimposed, and we see it as if the bird is in the cage.

Readers can now know the general idea of the above experiment. This is originally a very ordinary thing. An ordinary card is drawn according to the method and then turned to persuade it to work. But the reason is to use the afterimage effect of the retina of our eyeballs to get a continuous illusion. In this way, it seems that there is nothing unusual, but I don't know that scientists often get higher achievements in ordinary experiments. This is what ordinary people cannot do. Ordinary people are indifferent to things, but scientists study to the end. Ordinary people understand a thing, and they consider it done. Scientists understand a thing, and they also use it carefully. For example, an ordinary experiment above, scientists have invented movies based on the "afterimage" effect of people's eyeballs. In this way, it is still the ancestor of movies!

We may have all seen movies. The movement of movies is agile. It can make many fixed human images on the film move. The reason for this is, as we said before, due to the continuous movement, the bird enters the cage. Gentlemen, please think about it. Of course, it will not be different: the movie can be regarded as the largest industry in the modern era. The amount of capital invested and the people who depend on it directly and indirectly make people speechless when they are counted. Not only that, the cultural dissemination effect of movies can also be said to be a unique weapon. It can make things come alive in front of you. It is much better than the teaching method of us sitting stiffly in the classroom and listening to the teacher's lectures. However, its origin is the thing that is not worth a smile mentioned above.

From this, we can also know that we should carefully experience and study the things we encounter in our daily life. Even a very small thing that is not worth looking at should be studied. Although we do not have to become scientists or inventors, it is not useless to study things and use things. I hope readers do not think my words are false.

### I am a Refugee

— Refugee Reporter

People call me "refugee," and I myself admit that I am a "refugee."

"Refugee" is not a shameful term. It is only because my hometown has been destroyed by war that I have also sacrificed for the country and become a refugee. If my hometown is fortunately not in the war zone, but compatriots from other war zones flee to my hometown, then not only am I not a refugee, I may also be one of those who provide relief to refugees!

Even so, I cannot always rely on the relief of my compatriots. I must learn productive skills and study hard when I have the opportunity to receive an education. Because "refugee" is certainly not a shameful term, but it is shameful to be a "refugee" for the rest of my life!

Popular Song Lyrics

### Record of the JiaDing Three Massacres

— Zhang Mengfei

The Houhuang Bridge is stained with blood, recalling those years brings tears to my eyes,
How hateful that Ming Dynasty's Wu Sangui, invited the cruel enemy into our home, disrupting the peace,
Causing our great China to be without a pure land, the landscape changed color amidst the storm,
A generation of people suffered trampling, pitifully, their grievances cannot be redressed.
Only JiaDing city once resisted, willing to sacrifice blood and flesh,
Led by Huang Juyao, along with Hou Tongzeng,
Both were great loyal ministers of the Ming Dynasty,
These two gentlemen were inherently loyal and upright, unwilling to surrender to the Qing.
Recruiting brave men, gathering strong soldiers, everyone was willing to defend the isolated city,
Until the Qing soldiers arrived at the city, they went out of the city to resist with unparalleled courage.
Killing so many Qing soldiers that they cried out in pain, their blood flowed everywhere, their lives returned to the underworld.
At this time, the righteous people's reputation was strong, shouting to kill all the barbarians before stopping.
At that time, the Qing soldiers were defeated and retreated to call for help, and instantly swarmed in to besiege the city.

(Spoken) Sirs Hou and Huang, seeing the Qing soldiers returning, knew that they could not resist.
They ordered many strong men to close the city gates, and each guarded the city walls,
Prepared with rolling logs, stone catapults, short knives, bows and arrows, etc., waiting for them to attack the city.
They threw down ash bottles and catapult stones, or shot down random arrows.
If they climbed up the city, they only needed short knives to cut off their hands and feet, so many Tartars died again.

(Sung) At that time, the Tartars wanted to attack the city, but it was difficult to enter in a hurry.
The ash bottles and stone catapults above were like raindrops.
They wanted to use ropes to climb the city walls, but the ropes were cut off by knives.
So it was in vain to injure lives under the city, watching the city's firmness and inability to ascend.
The Tartars could only sigh at the city, saying that the JiaDing barbarians were stubborn.
Unlike other weaklings, who surrendered without resistance.
Therefore, they immediately dispatched a large army to block all four gates.
Besieged for such a long time, unexpectedly, an impact occurred after a month.
The grain in the city was exhausted, and it was difficult to maintain the will to defend the city.
So Hou and Huang had no choice but to resolutely express their feelings to the crowd,
Saying, "Everyone, we are all Han Chinese of the Ming Dynasty, a dignified people.
Now we are suffering the tragedy of losing our country and our homes, how can we be greedy for a day's life?
When the country is gone, the home is gone, a subjugated slave is lighter than a dog or pig.
You should know that in the past, the Yuan Dynasty called themselves emperors, oppressing the Central Plains was truly painful.
As the saying goes, ten households were supervised by three Tartars, and several families had to share a kitchen knife.
If it was the night of a wedding, the bride would first be given to the Tartars to have fun.
If it was a time for banquets and celebrations, the Tartars should be respected in the first seat.
Truly, all freedom was stripped away, and the shackles were like a prison.
Therefore, we are unwilling to surrender, and are willing to risk our lives today."
So everyone was brave and opened the city gate with a shout of killing.
Where the knives rose, the heads of the Tartars rolled to the ground, where the spears stabbed, the lives of the barbarians immediately returned to the underworld.
Everyone said, "Kill one to repay the debt, kill two to earn one."
"Resist to the end" was the slogan, even if the body dies, the spirit does not die.
At that time, a group of righteous people gave their lives, and suddenly the earth was dark and the sky was dim.
Huang Juyao and Hou Tongzeng, their righteousness reached the clouds, and they lost their lives.
It is lamentable that the city was lost, and an order was given to massacre the city.
The Tartars' hearts were so cruel and vicious, that they only felt satisfied after three massacres.
Who knows how many people were killed, the accumulated corpses stank everywhere.
The innocent people suffered, and it was heartbreaking to see.
Now, occasionally passing by the Houhuang Bridge, the green pines and cypresses are coldly solemn.
Truly, a generation of righteous people shines like the sun and moon, and their names remain in history forever.

General Knowledge

### The Threshold of Reading Newspapers (I)

— Tantian

The old man I know, if I don’t see him for two or three days, when I run into him, he always asks me, “Sir, what’s been happening in the newspaper these days?” So I usually talk to him about the news of the day in general terms and then leave. But when I think about it carefully, the old man knows quite a few characters, and his level of Chinese is really up to the level of a first-year junior high school student, but he often says that he can’t understand the newspaper, he doesn’t understand the threshold. Every time he meets me, he always asks me “What’s been happening in the newspaper?” His meaning seems to be that the newspaper is creating the news, rather than that the society is creating the news. The "Lugou Bridge Incident", the "August 13th Incident", and all the current war news, all happened in the newspaper, rather than actually unfolding around us. This is really a joke!

But there are countless people like him who work hard for a living every day and know a few words but can't understand the newspaper! Moreover, current affairs have a great impact on their lives. For example, why can’t he do business as before the war, and be unemployed? Why are some people moving from the front building to the attic? Why are ordinary people worried about the current high prices? All these current events are directly related to him, so he can't help but care about current events. And he always asks me, "What's been happening in the newspaper?" Alas, in this turbulent era, if people don't understand current affairs, not to mention being unemployed, even people who have jobs, it is very important, because the newspaper not only tells him the necessary social phenomena of the future, but also indicates the actual living conditions of the present. If a person wants to know how to make a living and the steps of being a person, then he must read the newspaper!

Speaking of which, it is not easy for an ordinary person, even if his Chinese foundation is better, to really understand a newspaper. First, when you open a newspaper, your eyes are full of news, and the pages are seven or eight sheets long. Which news is important, is essential to read, which news is secondary, can be omitted. If you read it from beginning to end word for word, there is not so much time. How to start with the Twenty-Four Histories? Second, the layout and style of the news are novel, and the newspaper offices compete to be original. Often the beginning and end are separated, the length is uneven, it looks neither as clear as the Thousand Character Classic nor as easy to understand as Seven Heroes and Five Gallants, often the dragon sees its head but not its tail, making it inexplicable. Third, now science is advancing, culture is developing, and new terms are emerging one after another, some from physics, some from chemistry, and even more from political economy. These terms are naturally not understood by ordinary people. Fourth, the current newspapers, the sources of news, mostly have backgrounds, and are all government propaganda organs, not necessarily standing in the position of the common people to speak, to redress grievances for the common people, and to guide the common people to a way out, so the news published in the newspapers often differs greatly from the facts. Sometimes a major event occurs, and the news in each newspaper is also different. For example, take the "September 18th Incident". Chinese newspapers said that Japan invaded Chinese territory, wanted to destroy China, and dominate Asia. European and American newspapers said that the Japanese army wanted to hinder the interests of the great powers in China and would cause a second world war between the great powers, but Japanese newspapers said that they wanted to maintain peace in East Asia. This kind of statement is similar to Italy's invasion of Abyssinia. The newspapers said that Abyssinia was a barbaric country, and Italy had to civilize Abyssinia for the sake of promoting civilization. From this point of view, there are several ways of saying one thing. The public says the public is right, the wife says the wife is right, and the common people, when they see it, no wonder they don't understand the mystery.

I think, "To enable people like the old man to automatically read the newspaper, we must tell him the threshold of reading the newspaper, so that they first understand the threshold, and then various difficult problems will naturally be solved slowly. This is the best way: However, I myself am not very proficient in the threshold of reading newspapers on weekdays, especially what new terms, the political and economic relations of various countries... etc. I am ashamed to say that I myself do not understand many problems. (To be continued)

### Weekly War Report

Hubei

The Japanese army in central Hubei, since capturing Zhongxiang last week, is now trying to continue its advance. In recent days, due to the fierce counterattack of the Chinese army, the Japanese army's offensive has become the end of its rope. The Chinese army is actively operating in Changshou Store, Yangzi Town, Shuilong River, and Xiantao Town, which have been successively recovered. The Japanese suffered heavy losses. In addition, the Chinese army once recovered Taipingchang, Chenjiayan, Renjiaji, Yanmenkou and other places, but due to the large number of Japanese troops and the use of gas, they temporarily withdrew. Now the Japanese army is confined to the east bank of the Xiang River, occasionally firing artillery towards the west bank, probably with the intention of holding on. Last week, the Japanese army once again advanced west of Yujia Store, but after being met by the Chinese army, it retreated. There is no action yet. The Chinese army in southern Hubei has repeatedly encountered the Japanese army, especially the battle at the junction of Yangxin and Daye was the fiercest.

Guangdong

The Japanese army in the southern suburbs of Guangdong has recently built fortifications to hold on. The Japanese army occupying Dagang Maoer Ridge was fiercely attacked by Chinese artillery, and the Japanese army seemed to have suffered losses. Afterwards, the Japanese army retreated, and the area was recovered. The Japanese army between Zengcheng and Conghua once advanced towards Taizikeng Zhengguo area to test the waters, while another part of the Japanese army harassed Xiagangling. The Chinese army had sufficient forces and resisted separately, and as a result, the Japanese army failed to succeed. The Chinese army in Huaxian suddenly launched an attack a few days ago, and joined forces with another part of the Chinese army to attack the Japanese army near Changgang. On the same day, Chinese planes flew to Xinjie Taipingchang and other places to bomb, and the Japanese troops in both places suffered losses. In addition, the Chinese army in Hainan Island once launched a fierce attack on the Japanese army in Longmen City, Ding'an County, and Dongxi Township, Qiongshan County. It is said that in this battle, the Japanese army suffered extremely heavy losses and was very angry. They burned and killed wantonly in the city, and the people were disturbed and extremely panicked.

Jiangsu

In Jiangsu Province, the Chinese and Japanese armies have fought fiercely in Huaiyin and Yingcheng since last week. After the strategic shift, the Chinese army actively counterattacked this week in coordination with the large army, and at the same time launched a large-scale guerrilla team to engage in guerrilla warfare. As a result of the fierce battle, Yingcheng has been recaptured by the Chinese army, and Huaiyin is also surrounded by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in Yangzhou once invaded north of Zhaoguan Dam, attempting to threaten the rear of the Chinese army. After the Chinese army skillfully responded, it recaptured Zhaoguan, and the Chinese army is still in hot pursuit.

### The Value of "Non-Recognitionism"

— Maolie

Abyssinia was annexed by Italy, and the Italian King was called the Emperor of Abyssinia. The British and French countries initially did not recognize it, but after several twists and turns, they all recognized it one after another. Mussolini's arrogance greatly increased, so he actively assisted Franco, resulting in the victory of the National Army. Sure enough, Britain and France also did not recognize the National Army government at first, but now they have recognized it.

Austria was annexed by Germany. In order to appease the people, Britain and France feared that recognition would be too slow. Hitler's arrogance also greatly increased, so he painstakingly planned and then acted. A few days ago, he again carried out the trick of annexing Bohemia and Moravia, and dividing Czechoslovakia. Britain and France are now playing the non-recognition game again. How long this game will last is still unknown, but it seems to be very short-lived.

Upon investigation, the originator of "non-recognitionism" was Stimson of the United States. At that time, when our country's Northeast was invaded, Stimson had the intention of uniting with Britain to intervene, but Britain refused. Stimson then declared that he would not recognize the changes caused by force, thinking it was a remedy. This non-recognition is still valid!

Of course, with the non-recognition of various countries, at least aggressors can be sanctioned morally, so that aggressors have some scruples, fear, and dare not do whatever they want. This is the value of non-recognitionism. However, the same non-recognition, why does it fail for Abyssinia, Spain, Austria, or even Czechoslovakia, but it can still be effective for China? There is no other reason for this. First, the United States has the determination to maintain morality, and is not swayed by the reality of the violent. Before she has not changed her attitude towards China, other countries do not dare to take the risk of defying the world's justice, and arbitrarily recognize the evil forces of the aggressor; Second, and especially important, I think it is our persistent non-surrender, resisting to the end, which has provided a strong backing for this doctrine.

Therefore, I can say that "non-recognitionism" itself is valuable; But the existence of this value still requires countries that uphold justice to maintain it consistently, and the invaded country must work hard to be self-reliant, and not disappoint the good intentions of those who abide by this doctrine.

Czechoslovakia is finished, and the declaration of non-recognition by Britain and France is just a kind of self-deprecation. Only China is still resisting. Non-recognitionism was originally initiated for the Chinese incident, but its value still needs China to maintain it. China has made this contribution to a legitimate doctrine in the international community, and China is also worthy of pride!

### Writing and Personality

— GaoGao

Qin Hui and Yan Song committed the crime of slandering loyal ministers and harming the country and the people. Even their pearl-like articles were sentenced to capital punishment and could not be "hidden in famous mountains and passed on to future generations." Zhou Zuoren, in Peiping, was suspected of being a traitor in his behavior. Many secondary schools in Shanghai removed his works from Chinese textbooks, although his personality has not yet reached the period of "assessment."

If the saying "a gentleman does not abandon words because of the person" is credible, I would feel sorry for the people of ancient and modern times. Judging articles by articles, the masterpieces of Qin Hui and Yan Song, "I cannot see them!" I have always held a "high mountain looking up" heart for Zhou Zuoren's articles. To this day, I still hope that he can prove his pure personality with strong facts!

Because of deviant behavior and vile personality, the article is implicated. The general public's view is that it is a kind of punishment, and his spiritual property is completely denied, causing him to suffer deeper pain, whether he is dead or alive. At the same time, it also implies the meaning of killing a chicken to show the monkey, so that scholars who can write do not dare to follow in his footsteps.

Actually, it is not so. Art cannot be separated from life, and works are entrusted to personality. Painting, sculpture, music, all are like this, and literature is especially obvious. It must exist in the heart before it can be expressed externally; it must have a heart that "cannot bear to see people suffer" before it can write the supreme article in the world. Han Yu said: "The so-called writing must have it in the heart. Therefore, a gentleman is cautious in reality. The beauty and ugliness of reality, its expression is not reckless." Tolstoy directly believed that art must be "for life," or even not limited to art. He said: "The prerequisite for all faithful professions is not the love of work, but the love of humanity that must be loved. Under the belief that this work improves humanity, work must be loved. Only those who fill their love with this can do valuable work." Just think, this kindness and harmony, this loyalty and enthusiasm are enough to illuminate the ages; and what about adding sharp eyes, trans-era insights, and artistic skills to express it in writing? Naturally, there is an incredible power. With this power, it arouses the resonance of mankind; with this power, it promotes the reform of politics, law, morality, and thought; with this power, it saves all living beings from deep water and scorching fire. Tolstoy is Tolstoy because of this, and similarly, Gorky is Gorky, Romain Rolland is Romain Rolland, Confucius is Confucius, Pitt is Pitt, Han Yu is Han Yu... also because of this. Then, know that establishing words must be based on establishing virtue, "hiding it in famous mountains and passing it on to future generations" is not something that can be achieved by luck.

What is most taboo in art is hypocritical expression. If you don't drink, you have to compose a few poems about drinking, wild drinking, and expressing your feelings after being drunk; if you are extremely enthusiastic, you have to play the high-profile tune of swearing alliances with seagulls and visiting fishermen and woodcutters; if your chest is full of selfish desires and evil thoughts, you have to say high-sounding words such as taking on righteousness and saving the people. "If you don't establish sincerity in rhetoric," where will there be good writing! Even if you "write as much as your height," it is just a temporary addition of many imitations, many rocks in the universe, not pearls and jade, and you will never be able to pass them on to future generations.

Even if his writing skills are very high, he can cover up the eyes of all people in the world; but his hypocritical life will always be exposed one day, especially in the "cold season." Once exposed, the "insincere" article, the "moment of expensive paper in Luoyang" has passed, and it is still not worth half a penny, for people to "cover the jar." No matter how similar the Yue Fei played on the stage is, he cannot be referred to as a national hero.

I deeply hope that young people who aspire to literature and art, in addition to devoting themselves to the cultivation of skills, will devote themselves to the cultivation of a great personality and a fulfilling life. Write the most sincere and emotional article with kindness, harmony, loyalty and enthusiasm, for yourself who is not in vain in this life, and for the Chinese nation who is resisting the war and building the country!

### "Hu Dahai"

— Jing Shusen

When it comes to "Hu Dahai," who doesn't know him within a hundred miles? Even the crazy yellow animals have to call him "Sir"!

Speaking of "Hu Dahai's" qualifications, he has also recited the Four Books and read the Five Classics; but he would interpret the words "national tax" as "the country is weakening, so it wants the people to donate money." He would also interpret the sentence "Yan Yuan died, and the Master cried bitterly" in the Analects as "After Yan Yuan died, Confucius cried so much that he wanted to drill a hole." There is no telling how many jokes he has made like this.

Originally, the name "Hu Dahai" was a nickname given to him by others; however, judging by the name, you can know what kind of form and personality he is. Perhaps the enemy thinks he is a bit silly, but somehow, he was appreciated by a general named Teng, who insisted on making him an official and gave him the title of Transportation Minister;—in fact, he was just using him as a handyman to guard the highway and the foreign bridge—and gave him a flag and an armband. The flag was also written with seven big characters: "Hu Dahai, Honorable Sir."

Usually, "Hu Dahai" seems to be there or not; however, after being promoted by General Teng, everyone unanimously said that "Hu Dahai" has officially become a traitor. But "Hu Dahai" does not argue with people.

Once, suddenly "Hu Dahai" happily walked into his home—Luoyang Village—with a fully armed enemy, scaring the people in the village to run around in a panic; especially the young women.

At that time, the people in the village were gnashing their teeth and cursing "Hu Dahai," why didn't he have fun on the street and lead people to the countryside to make trouble? Isn't this "inviting ghosts into the house"!

Hey! This time, "Hu Dahai" did something that no one could have imagined, which was better than eloquent facts: it was not "inviting ghosts into the house," it was clearly "closing the door to catch ghosts"!

It turned out that "Hu Dahai" had repeatedly seen the patrolling enemies slaughtering his compatriots and trampling on the women of his country, and he had long been unable to bear it; however, under the iron hoof, he had no chance to strike. This time, he was waiting for the opportunity: he tricked the most bastard of them into his own home, kindly serving him wine and food; he also called his own wife out to persuade him to drink, slowly getting the bastard drunk, and then seized the weapon that he used to kill people and killed him! This is called "using his own way to treat his own person."

Afterwards, every night, there were always enemies' companions shouting "Boss! Boss..." near Luoyang Village. This is probably the name of the enemy killed by "Hu Dahai," right?

From then on, the flag of "Hu Dahai, Honorable Sir" was never seen on the highway. At the same time, in the anti-Japanese base camp—the guerrilla team—there was one more person, "Hu Dahai."

### Lodging

— Su Ying

A moonless night.

Wangjia Village, shrouded in darkness, has no pedestrians on the fields.

Sparse gunshots were ringing in the distance. The dogs in Wangjia Village suddenly barked.

Wang Chunfa's door was ringing like a drum. Wang Chunfa opened the door, and he saw a tall man in short clothes standing outside the door, gasping for breath:

"Sorry, fellow villager! There are devils chasing from the front and back. I am alone, and one tree cannot make a forest. Let me stay for one night, and I will leave at dawn!"

"Um... you..." Wang Chunfa didn't quite understand where he came from.

"I am a New Fourth Army soldier. Tonight, I was ordered to go to Yinjiazhuang over there to suppress the devils. There were twelve of us, and there were more than fifty of them. It's terrible! Eleven of the twelve were lost, and I slipped here alone... Fellow villager! There are devils in front, too. Let me hide for a while, and I will leave at dawn!" He looked east, then west.

The distant gunshots were still ringing sparsely.

"Okay, okay!" Wang Chunfa let the tall man into the house, closed the door, bolted it, and propped it up.

The tall man asked for a towel to wipe his sweat. He groped in his bag and took out a short gun. The gun was empty. He looked at the gun and nodded with a smile:

"Damn it! A full gun of bullets, all eaten by the devils! Hahahaha..."

Wang Chunfa's door was ringing again, even tighter than the tall man had knocked.

Wang Chunfa led the tall man into the pit in the back. Above it was a stinky pigsty. Two fat pigs were not awakened by them and were still snoring soundly.

As soon as Wang Chunfa opened the door, four ferocious yellow-clothed men crowded inside.

They searched the living room, then the kitchen; they rummaged through the bedroom, and stirred up the pigsty, but they couldn't find the tall man. The two fat pigs were disturbed and ran around grunting. With a whistle, they left.

Wang Chunfa closed the door, bolted it, and propped it up.

There was no sound in Wang Chunfa's house, quiet, quiet, quiet until dawn.

The tall man stepped out of Wang Chunfa's door, shook hands with Wang Chunfa, and nodded.

"It's nothing else, we're just too tired. We want to find a girl to comfort us. It's also a way to 'befriend China'!"

Fang Hui took a step back and pointed the × army's box cannon with her finger, saying:

"You say 'befriend', but you point this murderous thing at me. Is this also a way to 'befriend'?"

The × army soldier smiled and was about to hand the box cannon to the person behind him, but Fang Hui quickly stopped him, saying:

"No! The weapon is in your hands. It's the same no matter who you give it to. I will never be fooled. Unless you give it to me, I will believe that you are sincerely 'befriending' us."

The × army soldier was quite hesitant at first, but later, relying on the two guns behind him, and because he was infatuated, he didn't bother to weigh the pros and cons. He actually confidently handed the box cannon to Fang Hui. Fang Hui took the box cannon, smiled, and waved to the × army soldier, saying: "Please come in!"

The × army soldier was overjoyed. The thatched cottage was clearly a city of the unjustly dead, but he mistook it for a comfortable nest. He stretched out his hands, intending to embrace Fang Hui. Fang Hui had already prepared, and gently flicked the mechanism of the box cannon. With a bang, the bullet hit the × army soldier's chest. The × army soldier didn't even have time to shout before he collapsed to the ground. The other two × army soldiers, seeing this change, hurriedly opened fire on Fang Hui. Although the flashlight had already gone out, Fang Hui's left arm was still hit by a bullet. Fortunately, the nurses in the rooms on both sides heard the gunshots and rushed out one after another. Thus, in a fierce fight, the other two × army soldiers were also killed. The small annihilation battle ended victoriously.

Fang Hui had the military doctor in charge dress the wound on her arm, and then, together with the nurses, called out to the villagers. The elderly, weak, women, and children had already heard the gunshots and refused to come out no matter what, until they knew there was no danger. Then, they all gathered tremblingly, and when they saw the bodies of the × army soldiers in front of the thatched cottage, they couldn't help but be surprised. Fang Hui briefly reported the process of killing the enemy just now to them, and said to them:

"If you are obedient subjects under the enemy's hands, you will always be on tenterhooks and will not get a moment's peace. Now that we have done this, the enemy may retaliate against you. I'm thinking for you. The only way is to follow us and join the guerrilla team led by Commander Ye, so that you can save your lives and avoid being harmed by the enemy."

The elderly, weak, women, and children were originally afraid that killing the × army soldiers would implicate them. When they heard Fang Hui say this, they all felt that her words were correct, so they went back to pack their clothes and valuables. Fang Hui also borrowed a pair of door panels from them, piled the bodies of the three × army soldiers on top of them, and, together with the captured spoils of war and the injured warriors who were being treated, were carried by stretcher-bearers and the people, heading north under the starry sky to find Commander Ye's team to rejoin.

### A Brief Account of Shanghai's Charitable Undertakings

Huang Hanzhi

According to past history, there were no so-called charitable organizations. Supporting the elderly and caring for children, showing compassion to the lonely and widowed, and burying exposed bones were all matters included in political performance evaluations. Therefore, King Wen's benevolent governance necessarily started with widowers, widows, orphans, and the childless. In later generations, as political teachings gradually declined, members of society, based on their benevolent hearts, provided support and relief to supplement the inadequacies of politics. The so-called "eight hundred lonely and poor" and "ten thousand grand mansions" were purely acts of individual benevolence. Shanghai is a place where people from all directions gather, and the population is dense. In recent years, natural disasters and man-made calamities have been almost constant. In addition, the cost of living is rising daily, and unemployment is increasing. Therefore, charitable undertakings are also being expanded day by day.

During the 16th year of the Republic of China, Mr. Wang Yiting and Hanzhi et al. noted that there were many charitable organizations in the city, and the undertakings they ran were gradually expanding. It was appropriate to have a unified organization to gather wisdom, benefit from diverse perspectives, and unite efforts, so that there would be organized plans internally and substantial strength externally. Hence, the organization of the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Association was established. The undertakings run by each member of the Joint Association are listed below.

In addition to the above, there are still dozens or hundreds of charitable organizations run by various guilds, associations, and native place associations. The undertakings they run are nothing more than the above-mentioned items. When the August 13th Incident broke out, the addresses of most charitable organizations were in Nanshi and Zhabei, and most of their properties were in Kunshan, Jiading, Songjiang, and Qingpu counties. Some were destroyed by fire, and some were looted. The actual figures for the losses are almost impossible to investigate. Many undertakings were thus suspended. Even those within the concessions were significantly affected, with reduced income and financial difficulties, barely managing to maintain operations. According to a recent written survey by the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Association, the current status of various charitable organizations is as follows.

Other charitable organizations have not yet submitted reports. In short, during this war, the properties of various charitable organizations were almost completely destroyed. It is extremely difficult to seek recovery. Currently, charitable undertakings are focused on providing relief to refugees. A brief account of the refugee relief situation of various relief organizations is as follows.

In the winter of the 25th year, due to the Suiyuan war, charitable organizations throughout the city jointly initiated the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, sending personnel to Suiyuan to distribute emergency relief. The following year, they took over the drought relief in Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. After the August 13th Incident, the Refugee Relief Committee of the War Zone was established, organizing a monk medical team to rescue wounded soldiers at the front. They established three refugee hospitals and contracted four hospitals, successively rescuing more than 10,000 wounded officers, soldiers, and civilians. They established more than 70 shelters, accommodating more than 200,000 refugees at the peak, and sending more than 50,000 refugees back home. The necessary expenses, in addition to government assistance, were purely dependent on donations from Chinese and foreign philanthropists and enthusiastic overseas Chinese. As of recently, the funds used have reached more than two million yuan. However, in this environment, Shanghai has become an isolated island, with industry and commerce in distress and finance tight. Donations have become exhausted, and the future is uncertain. Therefore, it is necessary to make drastic cuts. Those in charge can only do their best with the people's resources.

At the same time, there was also the Shanghai Branch of the Refugee Relief Association during the Extraordinary Period. After the fall of Shanghai, it was renamed the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association Refugee Relief Branch. Chinese and foreign philanthropists formed the Shanghai International Relief Committee. The Chinese Red Cross Society also established an international committee to assist various relief organizations in Shanghai. The committee ended at the end of October. People from all walks of life in China and abroad felt the need for an assistance mechanism of this nature, and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association was established to take over the tasks of the International Committee and assist various organizations directly accommodating refugees with food and supplies. The approximate number of refugees currently being accommodated by various organizations is as follows.

1.  The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association Refugee Relief Committee runs 30 shelters, 4 self-sufficient refugee centers, and 1 vagrant education center, totaling more than 33,300 people.

2.  The Refugee Relief Committee Branch of the War Zone runs 40 shelters, with a refugee population of more than 19,700 people.

3.  The Shanghai International Relief Committee runs 4 shelters, with a refugee population of more than 10,200 people.

4.  The Jiangning Native Place Association and others run 31 shelters, with a refugee population of more than 10,700 people.

5.  The Nanshi Refugee Area runs 113 shelters, with a refugee and poor population of more than 41,000 people.

The locations of the above shelters are mostly in the Nanshi Refugee Area. There are 73 shelters in the Public Concession, with more than 53,200 refugees. There are 8 shelters in the French Concession, with more than 15,800 refugees.

As for Tongren Fuyuan Hall and Pushan Villa, since the start of the Shanghai War, they have been entering and leaving the war zone at the risk of their lives to carry out general burial work. Their courageous spirit is especially commendable. The burial grounds are full, and it is difficult to find open spaces within the concessions. The difficulties are even greater. Recently, with the onset of winter, there are fewer deaths. Tongren Fuyuan Hall specializes in burial matters in Nanshi and the French Concession. Pushan Villa specializes in burial matters in the Public Concession, clearly delineating boundaries and working hard. This is also a deformed development.

### Shanghai's Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry

— Chen Cunren

Shanghai's traditional Chinese medicine industry is quite interesting to discuss. There are 383 traditional Chinese medicine stores and 69 medicinal material stores. Western pharmacies coexist with the traditional Chinese medicine industry, but based on the number of prescriptions dispensed, it can be seen that the foundation of the traditional Chinese medicine industry is long-standing, and the business is flourishing, which is truly surprising and amazing. According to investigations, the daily number of prescriptions dispensed by traditional Chinese medicine stores is: the most is as high as 1,200 prescriptions, 300 prescriptions is the most common, and each store has at least 50 to 60 prescriptions. In total, Shanghai dispenses 70,000 traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions every day. Approximately 58 Chinese-owned Western pharmacies dispense prescriptions, with a total of 3,000 prescriptions dispensed daily. From the perspective of the number of prescriptions dispensed, the ratio is one to twenty-six.

The busiest time for traditional Chinese medicine stores is in the summer, and the most profitable time is in the winter. Recently, medicinal paste prescriptions have become popular. On the full moon day of last month, Hu Qingyu Hall's daily business income reached 24,035 yuan. Other traditional Chinese medicine stores have seen business increase by about 40% due to the concentration of population caused by the war. About 40 new stores have opened this year, and it seems difficult to find stores that will lose money by the end of the year. The usual annual business income reaches more than 9.6 million yuan, which cannot be said to be unsuccessful!

Most traditional Chinese medicine stores have a capital of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Tong Hanchun has the largest capital, reaching 1 million taels. Before the war, there were 3,475 employees. Treatment has greatly improved compared to ten years ago. There is a trade association, with my friends Gao Zhiwen, Song Fuchen, Qiu Yanling, Shen Hefu, and Shi Qintang as standing committee members.

Medicinal material stores are divided into firms and numbers: there are 61 medicinal material firms and 8 herbal medicine firms. There are also more than 90 firms from various guilds, divided into mountain goods, northern goods, Sichuan-Han goods, Guangdong goods, and western goods. 35 new stores have opened since the war, some of which were organized by people who were idle after the war, which shows that the business after the war is indeed quite prosperous. The medicinal material firms also formed the Medicinal Material Industry Trade Association, with a very sound organization. My friends Mao Zijian, Fei Tinghua, Dong Bowei, Xia Qizhen, and Chen Wenming are the leaders of the industry. Their command and planning have achieved remarkable results, the recent case being the collection of surcharges from refugees.

In addition to supplying traditional Chinese medicine stores in this and other cities, the medicinal material firms also declare and ship goods to countries around the world. There are no statistics on the annual declarations by medicinal material firms in Shanghai, but it is estimated to be at least more than 3 million yuan. The National Government's Central Pharmaceutical Research Institute recently compiled statistics, stating that the national export of traditional Chinese medicine reached 10 million yuan, which is a surprising gain in the war of resistance economy. Is traditional Chinese medicine useless? Can Chinese people who do not take traditional Chinese medicine not feel ashamed?

The efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine is in line with the physique of the Chinese people, so its business has never declined. The large number of people ordering medicinal paste prescriptions is truly unbelievable to outsiders. On the opening day of Beijing Hongrentang, 60 dan of donkey-hide gelatin were sold. The annual sales of donkey-hide gelatin from Feng Cunren and Cai Tongde are also huge. I believe that if the traditional Chinese medicine industry is improved and guided by new intellectuals to improve the medicines one by one, the results will be far greater than today.

The prepared medicine business of traditional Chinese medicine stores is far less than that of Western medicine. Only Lei Chongshang's Liushen Pills have annual sales of more than 420,000 yuan; Tong Hanchun's Zaizao Pills have annual sales of more than 220,000 yuan; Hu Qingyu's Biwen Pills have annual sales of 100,000 pills; and Tongchuntang's Baibu Paste also has huge sales. Other examples are not easy to point out. In fact, Chinese prepared medicines are very worthy of promotion. Recently, Xia Tieying established the Beijing Pharmacy, because Beijing is the champion of national prepared medicines, hence this specialized organization. Since its opening, the business has been extraordinarily prosperous. The reputation of Beijing medicines has always been good, and the future is very promising. Sanyou Industrial Cooperative has also been paying attention to traditional Chinese medicine in recent years. The daily sales of Zhifeng Pills are 300 boxes, which is not surprising; the daily sales of Fangbian Pills in Shanghai have reached 1,500 bottles, and daily sales in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia have reached 3,000 bottles. This is truly recovering a lot of profits. I believe that if Chinese prepared medicines are promoted using new marketing methods, it will be easier for the business to outperform ordinary Western medicines.

One more point: among the stories of various industries in Shanghai, the traditional Chinese medicine industry has the longest history and the most prosperous business. The Jiang Yanzhe and Yao Taishan stores were recorded in the Shanghai County Chronicles a hundred years ago. At that time, Shanghai was a barren land, and the traditional Chinese medicine business was already impressively visible! This is also a good story.

The most information for this article was provided by Mr. Sun Wenyi, a famous figure in the pharmaceutical industry. Mr. Fei Yongzuo and Mr. Jiang Youcheng of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association also contributed. I express my gratitude in writing.

### The Chinese Team and the International Settlement Volunteer Corps

— Ming Shihao

Thirty-three Years of Effort and the Growth of the Translation Team

A Brief History of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps: In the 95 years since Shanghai was opened as a port, the International Settlement Volunteer Corps has a long history of 85 years. Although its origins are ancient, its military equipment is quite modern. Although it has been subject to economic difficulties and austerity measures in recent years, it still includes more than 20 teams of different nationalities, including British, American, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Portuguese, Filipino, and Jewish, and is still a force for emergency relief in the Public Concession.

The establishment of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps in Shanghai dates back to 1853. The motivation for its organization was the influence of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolutionary movement. At that time, the concessions did not have the right to station troops for self-defense. Foreign merchants, aware of the booming power of the Hong Yang army and the precarious state of security within the concessions, gathered together with the consuls of various countries in Shanghai to jointly devise defensive measures. They decided to organize volunteer corps from various countries, recruit merchants living in Shanghai to enlist, and appoint Captain Tulangsun, an officer of the British Indian Army, as commander. At that time, American expatriates also formed their own team, commanded by Captain Kyle. This was the beginning of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps. After the Battle of Muddy Creek, it was disbanded for a time. In 1860, the Taiping Army launched a second uprising, and its power was restored. It was re-recruited, and two teams were formed, each with only 80 men. Two years later, under the guidance of Captain Bowlans, it was gradually expanded and began to take shape. In 1870, there were three infantry teams and one light cavalry team, with 200 members. Two mountain guns were transported from Hong Kong, and a field artillery team was established. In 1878, the entire corps was reorganized, the light cavalry team was withdrawn, and two infantry teams were reorganized. At that time, the commander was Mr. Doulitai, and his brother took over his position until Mr. Dou returned to his country in 1882. In 1883, when the entire corps held its first review, there were already 176 officers. Three years later, the artillery team was donated by the British government and obtained four artillery pieces. By 1895, the Portuguese team had joined, and the light cavalry team was also restored. In 1900, after the Boxer Rebellion, the entire corps underwent major changes. At that time, the commander was Major Gracock, and there were 350 members. Later, the Customs team, the American team, the Japanese team, and the armored car team were established and joined one after another, reaching 1,000 people, and the strength was greatly increased. At the same time, the Public Works Department also launched the organization of a machine gun team and purchased many light machine guns, which were distributed to various teams for application. Since then, it has gradually evolved and become more perfect! The powers of the Commander-in-Chief (Corps Commander) have also become more onerous. In the beginning, the corps commanders were all voluntary, but at this point, the Public Works Department requested the British military to send military officers to Shanghai to take charge of the matter, and set a term of three years. The first corps commander was Major Watson, who was succeeded by Captain McGinquan, in 1905, and in 1908 by Major Pence. In 1913, it was Major Whiteley. When the European War broke out, all the soldiers were called back to their countries to participate in the war, and there was no way to send them for a while, so the British military appointed the leader of the corps, Major Truman, as commander to be responsible for the corps affairs. After the war, the old system was restored. The succeeding corps commanders were Major General Manay Johnson in 1920, Colonel Gordon in 1925, Colonel Apun Pamou in 1928, Colonel Slimus in 1931, and Colonel Grehan in 1934. The current corps commander is Colonel Xiang Pei, who took office in 1937. Recently, the average number of people in the entire corps is more than 2,400. Except for about 400 Russian team members who are employed, the rest are volunteer members. The number of people in each team is more than 100, and the number of people in the smaller teams is 40 or 50. The authority to command the International Settlement Volunteer Corps belongs to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department. The Director-General of the Public Works Department has the responsibility of administrative head of the corps. The highest organization of the corps is the Corps Headquarters, which is divided into the Corps Headquarters Battalion, A Battalion, B Battalion, and C Battalion, and the infantry, cavalry, artillery, armored vehicle, and machine gun teams are all under its command. The order in which the teams joined the International Settlement Volunteer Corps and their names are listed below (in order of the date of formal approval).

A Review of the Chinese Team: Since the opening of Shanghai as a port, there has been no status for Chinese people in international organizations. If there is, it should start with the Volunteer Corps. Because the national power was weak, foreigners discriminated against Chinese people. Therefore, Chinese people did not participate in the International Settlement Volunteer Corps at first. Until 1905, when the Great Trial of the Mixed Court case occurred, the local security was disturbed day and night. Therefore, Chinese business leaders Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Hengzhi, and Hu Jimei believed that the Volunteer Corps maintained local security and protected the lives and property of residents, which was an urgent matter at that time. They then invited more than 100 leaders from various industries to be directors, raised funds to organize, and set up various facilities. It was initially named the Chinese Businessmen's Gymnastics Association, and later renamed the Chinese Team Association. At that time, more than 500 team members were recruited, divided into a military band team, a cavalry team, and four infantry teams, etc., and military uniforms, guns, and equipment were purchased, and training grounds and gyms were established. This was the pioneer of the Chinese Volunteer Corps. Later, the establishment of the Chinese Team was originally closely related to the Chinese people living in the Concession, and since they lived in the Concession, they also had the duty to protect the merchants and people in the Concession. Therefore, they applied to the Public Works Department to join the International Settlement Volunteer Corps as the Chinese Team, and signed an agreement for 83 people to join the team at the Municipal Hall on Nanjing Road in 1907.

The Initial Hard Work: After the agreement was signed, the Corps Commander Watson presented to the Public Works Department to appoint Corbett, the former captain of the Customs Team, as the captain of the Chinese Team, and Grey Lie and Waterc as the deputy captains. Chinese people could only act as platoon leaders with the qualifications of team leaders. However, with the overall team members compromising and striving to improve, and always maintaining a pure combination, they made Chinese and foreign people shift their skeptical views and become enthusiastic admirers, and were treated equally with the teams of various countries. How could we have expected today's prosperity of the Chinese Team!

The Process of Struggle: After the Chinese Team was established, the first time it participated in the overall shooting competition was the "Nevis" trophy in 1909. It was an instant hit, and the results were excellent, which was praised by all sectors at home and abroad. After that, the team competed in the entire corps competition and external competitions, and they were always among the best. To mention the most prominent ones, they won the overall corps competence shield competition more than seven times. It is difficult to describe the victories won in international shooting competitions. It is well known that the Chinese Team's training and shooting are serious and the discipline is strict. All the members of the team can usually be resolute and hardworking, abide by the law and endure hardship. Once they are sent out for defense, they do not hesitate to work hard even in the hot summer and cold winter.

Records of Past Deployments: Since the establishment of the Chinese Team, it has participated in 11 overall corps deployments, including the recovery of Shanghai in 1911, the Second Revolution in 1912, the Third Revolution in 1914, the rickshaw wave and the peddlers' strike in the same year in 1918, the "May Fourth" Movement in 1919, the Jiang-Zhe-Qi-Lu War in 1924, the "May 30th" Massacre in 1925, the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army in 1927, the "January 28th" Sino-Japanese War in 1932, and the recent "August 13th" Anti-Japanese War. In every riot, the Chinese Team was always the first to mobilize and the last to withdraw its defenses. During the deployment period, the tasks of the Chinese Team were no different from those of ordinary troops, either guarding and patrolling to prevent rioters, or providing translators to meet the great needs of emergency situations.

The Origin of the Translation Team: Since the two deployments of "January 28th" and "August 13th", the effectiveness of translators has become more and more obvious. Because the military, police, and Volunteer Corps of various countries gathered in one corner and were frequently mobilized, they were very obstructed by the local dialect. In order to avoid misunderstandings and benefit security, it was urgent to find local help. This is the origin of the Translation Team. In the past, this kind of translator was filled by members of the Chinese Team who were proficient in foreign languages. The organization that formed the group was roughly formed during the "January 28th" Shanghai Incident. At that time, many Chinese employees of various commercial firms who were proficient in Western languages volunteered to serve in the defense lines of various friendly troops and the Volunteer Corps, acting as interpreters for Chinese and foreign soldiers and civilians, eliminating barriers and harmonizing feelings, and achieved good results. However, at that time, it was temporary in nature. Later, Corps Commander Colonel Slimus deeply felt that this organization needed to be established permanently, so he submitted a request to the Public Works Department for approval, and it was officially established as a team of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps on October 1 of that year. The position of team leader was concurrently held by Chen Shixia, the captain of the Chinese Team, who started military training, and Wang Tingkui, Bao Xianqiang, and Zhang Nieyun were appointed as team officers to assist in everything. The team members' uniforms, guns, and training were the same as those of ordinary team members. In recent years, the number of competent team members has often reached 120, and although the team was established not long ago, it has already won the national competent silver shield in the previous session. During the "August 13th" battle last year, the work of the team was particularly valuable, and they were extremely hardworking in their birth and death risks.

Past Team Leaders and Recent Overview: After the establishment of the Chinese Team, in addition to the first two team leaders, the British Mr. Corbett and Mr. Grey Lie, the subsequent successors were Mr. Xu Tonghao (the current corps deputy, who once served as the commander-in-chief of the entire corps), Mr. Hu Yunqiu (the current Chinese affairs consultant of the corps headquarters), Mr. Hao Boyang, Mr. Zhang Tingrong, and Mr. Wang Yanqing. Those who have served as team officers are Mr. Tu Xiantai, Mr. Yang Wenqing, and Mr. Wang Zhiren (the current standing military officer); Chen Shixia, the current captain of the Chinese Team and the Translation Team, took over in the "January 28th" battle; the current team officers of the Chinese Team are Yu Xianen, Li Yushu, Zhou Qingen, and Zhang Tinggui; the team officers of the Translation Team are Wang Yankui, Xu Shaorong, Xia Ranyu, and Zhong Yuting, etc. In recent years, thanks to the effective leadership of the team officers and the efforts of the team members at all levels, the team's performance has become more and more successful, and the number of people has also increased sharply. Recently, there are no less than 600 regular, reserve, and reserve team members. Leading the entire corps and competing for international glory is really commendable. We look forward to the future, how can we limit it? Recently, I heard that the team is starting to recruit new team members for this year. Those with lofty aspirations are willing to return to it.

### Job Registration and Talent Scouting

— Zhang Lin

The unemployment problem is really serious in Shanghai today. The high statistics have really broken previous records. According to reports, the China Section of the International Labour Office in Geneva has counted 300,000 workers alone. From these figures, we can infer that the overall unemployment figure in Shanghai must be quite high. Although Shanghai has a prosperous appearance at present, what about its internal affairs? The number of employees in the industrial, commercial, agricultural, and academic sectors has not only not increased, but is also decreasing, making it impossible for the general unemployed, especially those with poor knowledge and skills, to find a way out. At the same time, in recent years, thousands of Jews who have suffered unfortunate fates, Japanese who have come to China to "pan for gold," and unemployed White Russians, etc., have come one after another, making the problem of Shanghai's accommodation more and more difficult.

At a time when the tide of unemployment is so turbulent, registering for a job at an employment agency certainly cannot guarantee success, but perhaps there is some hope.

The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Institute, affiliated to the Chinese Vocational Education Society, is highly respected by society because of its considerable history and reputation. The work it undertakes to introduce jobs and scout for talents is highly regarded by society. Just step into the door and see the situation in that office where so many unemployed people who are requesting registration gather, and you can know the large number of unemployed people and the arduous work of the institute. Especially in recent years, it has to accept dozens or one or two hundred people for registration and interviews in a few hours of work every day. (No fees are charged)

The first step in registering with the institute is to fill out a job application form. In addition to filling in one's resume in detail, one must also fill in one's expertise, past experience, and spiritual and material hopes in detail, and then fill in the interview registration form and wait for registration and interview in turn.

After the interview, the registrar's appearance, attitude, speech, demeanor, obvious personality, physical characteristics, etc. are recorded one by one, and then this is used as a standard to introduce jobs by chance. However, the number of people who are registered every day who are successfully introduced to jobs is quite low - the reasons for this are naturally multifaceted.

Although there are so many unemployed people in real society, the lack of talent in various departments is quite serious. Many institutions and manufacturers ask the institute to scout for talent on their behalf, but the scope they need is mostly technical talent, such as: engineers, technicians of industrial plants, manufacturing technicians of chemical products, teachers of handicrafts, teachers of specialized subjects in schools, and skilled workers.

After receiving a request, if the registrants do not have such talent, the institute will publicly solicit it in the newspaper. As long as you pay a little attention to the readers of short messages in the local news of major newspapers, you can probably always see it. It is said that various specialized talents are publicly solicited, but they are still not available. It can be seen that there are too few people with knowledge and skills in society. On the contrary, there are too many mediocre people. If we combine the two difficult focal points of any department in real society hoping to obtain sufficient talent and the general mediocre people hoping to obtain good jobs, it is really impossible, except for the popularization of education and the improvement of the economic burden capacity of the general public in studying.

However, we always hope that the general public will learn as much knowledge and skills as possible, and temper their physique. Don't wander around all day because you have no money and no job, and "wait" for a job.

### "Old But Vigorous"

— Fei Ren

"Respecting the elderly" is a virtue, but respect is only "respect"; it does not mean "praising." But in China, traditionally, "old" is called "longevity." Grand events such as "Centennial Celebrations" are "praised" to the utmost. In fact, human premature death and longevity are very natural phenomena. At most, it makes me learn a little "health care," such as what pharmacies often use the "health care techniques" of "old people" as promotional advertisements.

Yesterday was Mr. Ma Xiangbo's Centennial Celebration, and the Fudan University Alumni Association held a celebration meeting at the New Asia Hotel. "Celebration" naturally also has the meaning of "praising," so is it superfluous? This is exactly the opposite. Mr. Ma Xiangbo's Centennial Celebration should be "praised" and is worth "praising" because what we "praise is not Mr. Ma Xiangbo's centennial," but "praise" Mr. Ma Xiangbo's "spirit."

Although he wrote in a letter to the Fudan University Alumni Association: "Since the war broke out, the country has no peace, the people have no livelihood, and they are displaced in foreign lands. I am ashamed of my lack of virtue and ability, and I always hate longevity and humiliation. I am deeply grateful for your celebration and wishes, and I feel embarrassed." But why did Mr. Ma Xiangbo "displaced in foreign lands"? He is only working hard and running around for the "people" who have "no livelihood" and the "country" that has "no peace." This kind of "spirit" should be and is worth our "praising"! On the contrary, even if you are young and handsome, with a graceful appearance, you are a "decrepit" in "spirit"!

Therefore, "old but vigorous" does not mean that the body is as strong as ever, but that the spirit is as energetic as in youth. On the occasion of Mr. Ma Xiangbo's centennial birthday, I would like to extend my congratulations with these four words, and at the same time encourage myself. We, the young generation, should work harder and make progress!

### After the Rain, the Sky Clears

Chapter 6: Praising the Longevity of a Person, One Seed Sprouts Three Excellent Talents; Narrating Friendship, Two Scholars Meet Heroes

At this time, He Liyu was very happy and said, "Then the three children are still with you? I must go and see them! I remember when we were in America, it was because of the five girls born in one birth in Morse Town, Canada, that caused a sensation around the world. Not only were visitors flooding through the door, but they also made a fortune in the film industry. There were always several films a year that used these five little sisters to attract audiences. In addition to making films, they were also used for advertising. All kinds of children's medicines and cosmetics used these five little sisters as trademarks. Although we only have two sons in one birth, people have two and a half pairs, and we only have one and a half pairs, which is still one pair short. But I also feel that it is rare. In ancient times, it would be considered a person of longevity." Zhu Ai smiled and said, "If you want to see them, we not only don't refuse, but we also welcome you very much. We take photos of these three little brothers almost every month. We take photos of them from the beginning of their birth at seven days old until now, and we have taken more than ten photos in total. Every time we take a photo, we always remember how many months and days they are. There is a photo album, and their photos are pasted in order. We want to see the process of their development. We will take photos of them again soon, and we also hope that you two and the three of them will take a photo together, which is very meaningful. If you want to see them, you can take you to see them tomorrow, but you can't see them for free, you have to pay a meeting fee!" In the middle of speaking, they were gradually approaching the village where Zhu Ai's hospital was located. It turned out that this town was originally called Anle Town. When the hospital for women and children was first built there, there were not many families in the town, only dozens of families. The hospital was also small in scale, only a church with an attached hospital. Later, through the hard work of that Tong Shengshi, she was a faithful believer who remained chaste and unmarried, and was enthusiastic about saving the world, and many people were moved by her. Her hospital became more and more developed day by day, and the local area became more and more lively day by day. Now the area has also expanded. Counting the gold towns around, there are a total of seven or eight hundred families. Not only that, but there are also several small factories in the town. The neighboring villages and towns are all sericulture farmers. In addition to private sericulture, there are also several collective sericulture places in the town. In addition, there are several weaving factories among the small factories. These sericulture farms and weaving factories are mostly female workers, and they are also most closely related to the women and children's hospital. As for other things such as small schools and libraries, they should have everything. Various facilities such as electric lights and electricity are almost as popular as more prosperous towns. (65)

### "Sensations of Going Places"

— Li Zhihua

Produced by Warner Bros. Shown at the Grand Theater

It seems that there are too many plays like "Going Places" in Hollywood. I think I should still let the diners reminisce about this kind of play you have seen, - horse racing, music, singing, the so-called "sexy and funny movie", by saying ""The story is like this"".

The "story of" "Going Places" is:

"Young Peter is a clerk of a sports goods company. He is ordered by the owner of the company to impersonate the famous Australian jockey Peter Rendall and carry a large number of sports goods to Marynan for promotion, because the horse racing meeting will be held there soon." As a result, this "impersonating famous jockey" met Colonel Whitling and his wife, who liked to watch horse races, and also met Colonel's son Jack and niece Ellen, a pair of young people who liked to keep horses.

What is even more coincidental is that Jack's beloved horse is named "Gibbs Creebs", who is startled, wild, and unruly, and no one dares to control it; the groom Gabby is good at knowing the horse's intentions, and whenever the horse's wildness breaks out, he always blows a trumpet and plays its special song, and the horse bows its head and obeys, and is unusually docile. And what about that Miss Ellen? Her famous horse "Ellen Girl" is a horse that "has participated in competitions many times and has never won a prize." Now that she sees that Peter's horsemanship is exquisite, she earnestly asks him to help her win the championship.

How is Peter's "exquisite horsemanship" seen? It is: "Gibbs Creebs" was startled and ran out of the stable, and Peter happened to fall on the horse's back: Later, it was thanks to "Gabby who rode a motorcycle and chased after him, and the horse stopped immediately when he heard the music," and the siege was solved.

But it is coincidental that "Ellen Girl" was stolen before the competition, so this "impersonating famous jockey" rode "Gibbs Creebs" to participate in the competition.

This competition also follows the usual practice of Hollywood's "sexy and funny movies." Of course, it must "win the championship," and the hero and heroine meet and End.

"Going Places" is also like this, not an exception at all. As for the way to win, it is "Gabby led a band according to plan and drove a car along the track and played the most favorite songs." However, this time it was not "the horse immediately stopped when it heard the music," this time it was "leading all the way," which was as satisfactory and smooth as the author imagined.

This story is familiar to you: "I seem to have seen it in some movie"? That's what you think, isn't it?

Naturally, your memory is not correct, because "Going Places" is the first time it has been shown in Shanghai; however, it cannot be said that you are wrong, because this kind of film is originally "almost the same."

Then is "Going Places" funny or not? The respectful answer is: I will give you an example, you see if it is funny or not: The groom is good at knowing the horse's intentions, and his trumpet can make the startled horse advance and retreat as he wishes, as the author imagines, he can "stop immediately" with it, and he can also "lead all the way." Do you think this is funny or not?

As for Dick Powell's Peter, he just stood silently on the horse's back, and other than that, he just sang a song with Annie Taylor Louise and others. That song may be used by the band in the dance hall, because there are already many such songs in the dance hall. Isn't it better and more fresh to have one more song?

### The Life of a Female Office Worker (Continued)

— Tsunami

Therefore, to apply for a female office worker position, one must have a standard "marketable appearance." Otherwise, even if you speak perfect "Yes, All-right" like a foreigner, it would still be difficult to pass the examination.

Although there are no strict regulations regarding qualifications for application, one must at least have an education level of having attended or graduated from middle school. Great importance is placed on conversational English, as well as proficiency in various domestic dialects. For example, Cantonese and Northern Mandarin are highly welcomed by the bosses. Next in importance is proficiency in abacus calculation, which is also a key part of the examination. As for Chinese language proficiency, it seems to be of the least importance. As long as you can write simple memos, you don't have to worry about failing the exam.

Speaking of female office workers' salaries, there's a great disparity even for the same position. Monthly pay ranges from seven or eight yuan to a maximum of twenty-plus yuan. How could that little money be enough? Just their expenses on makeup are quite considerable! Therefore, many female office workers need their families, like their fathers and brothers, to supplement their income, in addition to what they earn themselves. Clearly, a female office worker's fashionable attire is a case of "a poor man putting on airs," simply maintaining appearances!

Now let me talk about the extracurricular life of female office workers. A person's life is easily influenced by the surrounding environment. Those who can control the environment are the most rational and the most resolute. Often, innocent and pure girls, fresh out of school, enter these extravagant and decadent environments, and their eyes and ears are influenced, leading to transformation. Those who didn't perm their hair before start to perm it like everyone else. Those who used to find people wearing high heels strange and repulsive now wear them as a matter of course. Those who used to care about national affairs now find even reading a newspaper uninteresting. Generally speaking, female office workers are considered intellectuals, but in reality, out of a hundred female office workers, perhaps only ten or so read the newspaper every day. This is not the author intentionally exaggerating to sensationalize but rather facts seen and heard! Perhaps some alert female office workers share the same sentiments.

Speaking of their general leisure activities, under the guidance of some male colleagues, many frequently go to cinemas and theaters. Naturally, their main purpose is to use the cinema to live a life of "pseudo-romance." However, most female office workers spend their leisure time at home, helping their parents with trivial household chores or leading a muddled and unconscious private family life.

Of course, we cannot deny that a small number of female office workers have awakened amidst the sound of the Anti-Japanese War. They are participating in various direct and indirect anti-Japanese efforts. In the midst of a luxurious environment, they strengthen their resolve and actively carry out the sacred task of awakening and organizing their generally unfocused female colleagues, which is the fundamental work for the women's liberation movement. These dedicated and hardworking female warriors are worthy of our praise. (The End)
