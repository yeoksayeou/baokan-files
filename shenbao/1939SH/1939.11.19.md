### Continuing the Advance After Capturing Ke County, the Chinese Army in Western Shanxi Approaches Heilong Pass; Japanese Troops Retreating from Xiangning Suffer Heavy Casualties Along the Way; Japanese Invasion of Fangcheng and Qin County in Guangdong Results in Significant Fighting

Xingji: The Chinese army, having recovered Ke County, continues to advance eastward. On the 17th, it recaptured Hualuo Town by noon and cleared out all remaining Japanese forces in the vicinity. A portion of the Chinese army has now advanced to Heilong Pass, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese. The Japanese troops retreating from Xiangning have been ambushed, intercepted, and attacked at their flanks by various Chinese units along the way, leaving piles of corpses and becoming disorganized. By 11:00 AM, the fighting was most intense around Yitaitou, where the Chinese army destroyed five Japanese vehicles and killed over a hundred Japanese soldiers. Simultaneously, another unit of the Chinese army moved to encircle and attack, resulting in a complete rout of the Japanese forces. (Dispatch of the 18th)

Xingji: There are rumors that Yuncheng has been recovered by the Chinese army. A large number of wounded Japanese soldiers have been arriving in Quwo in recent days and are being continuously transported to Linfen. (Dispatch of the 18th)

Fencheng: Japanese troops in Yitaitou, north of Fencheng, received reinforcements of about two hundred men from the east on the morning of the 11th, and another eight hundred men by noon. They then moved south to harass the area, encountering fierce resistance from the Chinese army, which inflicted heavy casualties. Furthermore, on the 12th, over a hundred Japanese soldiers in Wulantou were completely annihilated in an ambush by the Chinese army. (Dispatch of the 18th)

If the Japanese Army Invades Guangxi Province, They Will Undoubtedly Suffer a Crushing Defeat

Chongqing: General Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Headquarters, commented today on rumors of a Japanese invasion of Guangxi Province, saying, "We only fear that the Japanese will not invade Guangxi. If they do, it would simply provide the Chinese side with another opportunity for annihilation. The Chinese side in Guangxi Province may adopt the same strategy as in Shanxi and northern Hunan, with the local people and army cooperating to destroy all roads and move all portable goods as much as possible before the enemy approaches. In this way, the Japanese army will be unable to establish contact and use its heavy weapons." It is also reported that Guangxi Province, in preparation for a Japanese invasion, recently convened fifty-four political work instructors from various parts of the province in Guilin. After six days of discussion, the instructors have returned to their posts to begin preparations. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)

Chongqing: According to Chinese sources, the situation on the border between Guangdong and Guangxi has become increasingly tense since the Japanese army occupied Fangcheng and Qin County northwest of Beihai. It appears that the Japanese army is currently aiming for Nanning and advancing inland. Nanning is a major town in southern Guangxi, located on the road to Vietnam. It is reported that the Japanese army is not advancing from Beihai but rather moving along the road northwest of Beihai, passing through Fangcheng and Qin County towards Nanning. The Japanese army occupied Fangcheng on the afternoon of November 16th and landed south of Qin County on the same evening. Japanese cavalry and infantry, under the cover of intense artillery fire, immediately attacked Qin County, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. According to Chinese telegrams received here today, the Japanese troops in the Fangcheng and Qin County areas are currently moving north along the road to Nanning. Chinese sources here believe that it will be extremely difficult for the Japanese army to invade Guangxi Province because the border area between Guangdong and Guangxi is mountainous. South of Nanning is Phoenix Mountain, and the border between Guangdong, Guangxi, and Vietnam is the Shiwan Da Shan. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)

Chongqing: According to reports here today, the Chinese army withdrew from Fangcheng on Wednesday evening, and from Qin County on Thursday evening. Before withdrawing, the Chinese army inflicted heavy blows on the Japanese army. At the same time, due to the relentless bombing of both cities by Japanese naval and air forces for forty-eight hours, they were severely damaged and turned to scorched earth. Therefore, it was decided to abandon them and retreat to favorable positions beyond the range of naval heavy artillery to continue the resistance. According to sources from American churches in the area where the Japanese army landed, there are about 30,000 Japanese troops operating in the area, including both army and naval marines. In the past three days, the shelling of cities in the Qinzhou Bay by Japanese warships has been largely ineffective, as it has failed to significantly damage Chinese defenses. This is because naval artillery is primarily designed to target ships and is not suitable for cities. According to Chinese claims this morning, the Chinese army has now withdrawn beyond the range of naval heavy artillery, but the extent of the retreat has not been specified. Foreign experts claim that the range of naval artillery is approximately one to two miles. (Associated Press dispatch of the 18th)

Chongqing: General Bai Chongxi, Director of the Southwest Headquarters, stated here today that the Chinese side had anticipated the Japanese landing operation in the Beihai area. The Guangxi Chinese army is eager for the Japanese army to continue to advance, as the conditions there, especially the terrain, are entirely favorable to the defending side. "Our only fear is that the Japanese army will not attempt a deep advance. If the Japanese army continues to advance and penetrate deeply into Guangxi, it would provide us with an opportunity to tie down the enemy in another area. Furthermore, if the Japanese side wants to achieve anything, it will need at least two divisions of troops. But even if the Japanese side uses two divisions of troops, we still have ample strength to deal with them." (Associated Press dispatch of the 18th)

### The Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee Passes Several Motions, Including Improving the Treatment of Wounded Soldiers

Chongqing: The Sixth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held its sixth meeting on the 18th, chaired by President Chiang. First, the minutes of the fifth meeting were read, and then the following articles were amended and passed: (1) Resolutions on reports on military, political, and educational affairs; (2) Four proposals examined by the military group; (3) Two proposals examined by the economic group; (4) A proposal by Committee Member Ma Chao and ten others to improve the hospitals and treatment for wounded soldiers; (5) A proposal by Committee Member Ma Chaojun and ten others to adjust military and public vehicles to facilitate civilian travel. (Dispatch of the 18th)

Chongqing: Among the various proposals at the Sixth Plenary Session, there are suggestions to establish two new ministries for forestry and water conservancy. Representatives supporting this proposal claim that forestry and water conservancy play a most important role in the construction work in the northwest provinces. Currently, this proposal is still under discussion. Previously, forestry affairs were handled by the Agriculture Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, while water conservancy was handled by the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Huai River Water Conservancy Committees. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)

National Assembly - Date of Convocation

Chongqing: Because President Chiang advocated for the early implementation of constitutional government, the Sixth Plenary Session will focus on the issue of when to convene the National Assembly. The task of the National Assembly is to formulate a constitution and establish a constitutional government to replace the current period of political tutelage. Previously, the Kuomintang had set November 12, 1937, as the date for convening the National Assembly, but it was postponed due to the prolonged war. After President Chiang urged its convocation, it will be decided this time. It is expected that the committees will set the winter of 1940 as the date for convening the National Assembly. At the same time, the committees have agreed on (1) that the work of selecting representatives in areas under the control of the Chinese government and in the occupied areas must be completed as early as possible before the National Assembly convenes; (2) that the representatives elected in 1937, except for those who have surrendered to the Japanese side, will still be considered valid.

### Japanese Troops Invade and Harass Northwest of Ruicheng

Luoyang: On the morning of the 13th, three to four hundred Japanese troops from Taiyukou (east of Yongji), along with over five hundred Japanese cavalry, infantry, and engineers, converged at the villages of Dongfu and Xifu, and then advanced to Zhangjiashan in the northwest of Ruicheng, with several aircraft providing support. The Chinese × unit intercepted them at Zhangjiashan Taishan Temple, while another unit maneuvered to flank them from the ×× area on the left wing. After a day of fierce fighting, many were killed. On the morning of the 14th, the Chinese army redeployed troops and launched a bayonet charge, and the Japanese forces, unable to withstand the assault, fled towards Yiyi Town, leaving behind many corpses and other military supplies. The Chinese forces are still pursuing them in victory. (Dispatch of the 18th)

Chongqing: Japanese aircraft, which had been silent for over a month, suddenly harassed Chongqing this evening. The local air defense command reported that twenty-seven Japanese aircraft, flying upstream along the Yangtze River from Hubei, intruded into Sichuan and then reached the vicinity of Chongqing. The Japanese aircraft then split into two groups, one heading directly over Jiangbei, while the other circled and reconnoitered over the outskirts of Chongqing for a long time before successively flying out from Jiang and around a certain area in western Hubei, heading east. The local air defense command issued an emergency air raid alert, which was lifted after about an hour. (Dispatch of the 18th)

### Guangdong Chinese Army Recaptures Zhanglin Bridge

Liuhuang: On the morning of the 14th, the Japanese army advanced in multiple directions. One route, with over forty Japanese soldiers and a heavy machine gun, invaded the mountainous area north of Shantou, firing fiercely with machine guns at Hailiansu. The Chinese army calmly responded, and when the Japanese army lost effective range, concentrated their fire in a counterattack. In less than an hour, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the assault and retreated. Another route, with about five hundred Japanese soldiers and seven mortars, advanced towards Zhanglin Bridge southeast of Wuyang Mountain, supported by Japanese aircraft. At the same time, Japanese artillery concentrated their fire and shelled the Chinese positions. After fierce fighting until 4:00 PM, the Chinese forces made a strategic withdrawal as their positions were completely destroyed. At night, Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a counterattack. By the morning of the 15th, the Japanese army had completely retreated, leaving behind many military supplies. Zhanglin Bridge has been completely recaptured by the Chinese army. (Dispatch of the 16th)

### Shandong Chinese Army Recaptures Laiyang

A Certain Place in Shandong (Delayed): On the 9th, over six hundred Japanese troops from Pingdu and Yexian invaded Laiyang eastward via Jiukou. After being intercepted and blocked by the Chinese army from multiple directions, and after two days and nights of fierce fighting, Laiyang City was recaptured on the 12th. A portion of the remaining Japanese troops fled south, but were ambushed by the Chinese army along the way, suffering heavy casualties. (Dispatch of the 15th)

### Chinese Aircraft Bomb Tianhe Airfield

A Certain Place: On the 11th, the Chinese air force bombed Tianhe Airfield, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese side.

### Tianjin Japanese Army Commander States That the Blockade of the Concessions Will Continue Intermittently Until All Pending Issues Are Resolved; Meat Is Exceptionally Scarce Within the British and French Concessions

Tianjin: General Honma, the commander of the Japanese army in Tianjin, stated to foreign journalists this morning that the Tianjin concessions will continue to be blockaded until all pending issues are satisfactorily resolved. When the Anglo-Japanese negotiations were progressing smoothly three months ago, the blockade could have ended, but the United States' abrogation of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation with Japan hardened Britain's attitude. When a reporter asked whether the Japanese military authorities would abide by the results of the diplomatic talks in Tokyo, Honma replied with a smile that soldiers must obey orders. He also said that he was very sorry that people of countries other than Britain were suffering as a result of the blockade and that he would try to reduce their inconvenience. The reporter drew his attention to the extreme shortage and high price of food and coal (homes, hotels, public places, and schools in Tianjin are now not burning coal for heating). Honma replied that the British and Japanese consular authorities were currently discussing the matter and that he expected a satisfactory solution. The reporter then asked why coal-carrying cars and ships had to unload coal and sift it at the blockade entrance, and told him that this was too time-consuming and increased costs. Honma replied that this was necessary for checking for weapons. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)

Beiping: According to reports received here by Chinese people, meat is now extremely scarce in the British and French concessions in Tianjin. Pork is selling for two yuan per catty, and mutton for one yuan and sixty cents, with prices so high and supplies still lacking. Getting meat is difficult, but within Chinese territory, pork is only selling for seventy cents and mutton for sixty cents. According to foreign sources, the blockade of the British concession in Tianjin has been tightened in the past few days, making it very inconvenient for people and goods to enter and exit, hence the high prices.

Editorial

### The War Aims of the European Belligerents

The European war has been going on for almost three months now. Given modern military technology and transportation capabilities, these three months should have been long enough to pass the stage of preparation, deployment, and troop mobilization, and enter a state of intense fighting. But in fact, the Western Front has not been tense for a single day. Recently, even the sound of artillery has subsided. If one were to say that the war is in the air or at sea: however, the air forces of both sides mostly engage in reconnaissance and surveillance, without any fierce battles occurring. As for the news of the activities of warships or submarines, although reports continue incessantly, given the enormous naval power of Great Britain and Germany's confidence in its submarines, how much of a threat have the two sides posed to each other? In short, it is a fact that the war is not tense. Not only is the war not tense, but recently both sides have suddenly raised the issue of war aims. On the German side, the Nazi Party's newspaper published six war aims, most of which are empty and boundless, and after Poland has already been destroyed, it suddenly said that it wants to restore a puppet Poland. On the British side, Parliament is scheduled to adjourn on the 22nd of this month and reconvene on the 28th, at which time it plans to spend three days discussing the war aims of this war in a leisurely manner. Such an issue should have been thoroughly examined and addressed at the very beginning of the war, so why discuss it at this moment? Does that mean that everything in the past has been an action without a goal?

The problem is certainly not that simple. Germany originally had a goal when it launched the war, and that goal was to seize Poland. Now that Poland has been obtained, and even the issue of a possible German-Soviet conflict that could have arisen has been eliminated, then other than hoping for a truce, it has no goal. Germany is willing to make peace, but Great Britain and France, bound by their obligations, are unwilling to stop, so Germany has to bite the bullet and continue fighting. But fighting in this way, Germany is already in a passive position. A passive war has no direction externally, and it is not enough to rally support internally, so it has to find a new goal outside of the old goal, in order to turn passivity into activity and turn being on the defensive into taking the initiative. A week ago, the border between the Netherlands and Belgium had reached a point of extreme tension, but recently it has suddenly relaxed, which may be precisely because Germany cannot rashly launch the second phase of the war before its goal is determined.

On the British and French side, didn't they raise the grand banner of anti-aggression at the beginning of the war? This is a very just goal, so why is there a need for further discussion at the moment? Why is it necessary to bother the members of Parliament to ask the government authorities to explain? So clearly, this is not a question of whether or not there is a war aim, but a question of having to re-evaluate that war aim. The anti-aggression goal of Great Britain and France is indeed just, but it is not clear enough, and their attitude over the past two months has not been active enough, perhaps precisely because of this. So now is the time to re-evaluate. Originally, Great Britain did not take advantage of the absolute superiority of the democratic front to lead the world's forces for peace and strike at the fascist front, and it cannot shirk the responsibility for its procrastination and mistakes; now that it has joined the war but cannot quickly achieve results and resolve the crisis in Poland, one cannot help but doubt that its attitude towards anti-aggression is not firm enough. Furthermore, such as the recent withdrawal of British troops stationed in North China, although it has its stated reasons, it ultimately cannot escape the suspicion of compromise. So the attitude of the British authorities has already made people feel very confused; not only are people in other countries confused, but even the people of its own country cannot help but be confused. Members of Parliament are asking the government to explain the war aims, perhaps because of such motivation.

A confused mentality will inevitably have a significant impact on the war, so it is indeed a serious issue for the belligerents. China's War of Resistance has already given the world a correct indication. The goal of resisting aggression, combined with the government's firm and unchanging actions, makes all the people of the country hold the belief that final victory is inevitable, and this is the key to defeating the enemy. Although the second phase of the European war has not yet broken out, there will always be a day when it breaks out, and once it breaks out, the belligerents must pursue victory and not allow themselves to hesitate. As for whose victory the first phase was, it is certainly not yet time to judge, but the second phase will certainly be an extremely important battle that can lay the foundation for the success or failure of the overall situation. The conditions for victory, of course, are related to military and economic factors, but especially important is the spirit, and whether the spirit is strong or not is extremely dependent on the war aims, so the re-examination of the war aims is an important key in the future war situation.

Currently, it is certainly difficult for Germany to find a war aim that is sufficient to rally support; but if the goals of Great Britain and France are not clear enough and not enough to rally support, they will also not be able to have the confidence to win. Great Britain and France did not previously lack goals, and the goals were not unjust, but their attitude was not active enough, so it made people confused; the current problem lies in correcting the wavering attitude of the past, further uniting all anti-aggression forces in the world, and advancing towards the original goal. In this way, the European war will be transformed into a true anti-aggression war, and with the support of many and with the advantage of the material strength of Great Britain and France, it will not be difficult to find a true world peace.

### Japanese Public Opinion Advocates Improving Relations with the United States; US Under Secretary of State Refutes Japanese Propaganda

Tokyo: Japanese public sentiment's call for a gradual offensive against third countries in China is increasing, especially focusing on the United States. All newspapers have reversed their attitude of the past two weeks. Those who previously conducted anti-American propaganda are now publishing articles opposing the rising prices of iron, herbs, etc. Well-known Japanese intellectuals have greatly changed their views. Since newspapers published the news that Prince Saionji will summon Prime Minister Abe, various circles have directly expressed their opinions on the current situation to the press or government officials. Count Kabayama Aisuke, a member of the House of Peers and president of the International Cultural Relations Association, visited Prime Minister Abe yesterday to contribute his views. Kabayama made many suggestions on the issue of improving Japan-US relations, believing that the actions of the Japanese army in China should not harm the rights of third countries. Kabayama urged Abe to avoid such actions, lest they cause another incident like the US abrogation of the Japan-US Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. Kabayama also said that if Japan can resolve the issue of American interests in China one by one, the Sino-Japanese War can also be ended sooner. According to Japanese newspapers, Count Kabayama will visit the United States next year, where he will meet with President Roosevelt "to exchange views" and strive to promote Japan-US cultural relations.

Washington: A Japanese spokesman in Shanghai recently made a statement saying that the US government is ready to recognize the new situation in China. Under Secretary of State Welles recently issued a statement to the press refuting this interpretation, saying that for a year, the US government has sent three notes to the Japanese government, the contents of which have been published and cannot be interpreted in this way. US Ambassador to Japan Grew has also not issued any statement in Tokyo that differs from the contents of the notes. (Havas dispatch of the 17th)

### Britain's Attitude in China Remains Consistent; British Newspaper Says There Has Been No Change

London: The Manchester Guardian said in an editorial today that since the outbreak of war in China, Britain's attitude on fundamental issues has never been in any doubt, and there is no possibility of Britain changing this attitude. As for the steps taken to withdraw British gunboats from the Yangtze River and British troops from North China, the reasons for this have been explained by the government and are due to the urgency of the war and are not related to Britain's overall policy. The British government's position on the Tianjin Chinese silver deposits and the Chinese legal tender remains firm and unchanged. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)

### Litvinov Reportedly Appointed to New Post, Director of Central Intelligence

Moscow: It is rumored that former People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov has been appointed as the Director of the Intelligence Department of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party. The People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs has neither denied nor confirmed this. According to well-informed sources, even if Litvinov is appointed to this post, it would be a nominal position with little real power. (Havas dispatch of the 17th)

### Rumors that the Netherlands and Belgium Will Make Another Peace Appeal, Inviting Denmark, Sweden, and Norway to Cooperate; the Netherlands and Belgium Issue a Statement Denying This

Copenhagen: It is rumored here that King Leopold of Belgium and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands have asked the diplomatic representatives of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark in the Netherlands and Belgium whether the monarchs of the three countries are prepared to cooperate in drafting a peace proposal. (Reuters dispatch of the 18th)

### Soviet-Turkish Relations; Turkey Maintains a Stable Force in the Balkans

Moscow: Turkish sources here recently stated that although Soviet-Turkish relations remain friendly as before, Turkish Foreign Minister Sarajoglu's visit here in September to conduct negotiations with the Soviet authorities failed to reach an understanding, so that the general situation between the two countries has not made any progress. At this moment, because Turkey is obligated to Great Britain and France, it has no choice but to reject the Soviet Union's request to blockade the Dardanelles Strait. At the same time, the Soviet Union is still unwilling to assist Turkey in resisting the invasion of the Balkan countries by Germany. These two points are the reason why the Turkish-Soviet agreement could not be concluded. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, after the Finnish issue is resolved, it may be possible to change its attitude. However, Turkey must still maintain a stable force in the Balkans, which is a zone of conflict between the interests of the Soviet Union, the other Balkan countries, and Italy. In addition, foreign observers here have not been able to confirm rumors that Bulgaria intends to negotiate a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet Union to jointly deal with Turkey, but they are paying great attention to the evolution of relations between the Soviet Union and Bulgaria.

### The Soviet Union Presents Three Demands to Finland; Roosevelt Explains Negotiations Regarding Finland's Loan from the United States

Moscow - Soviet newspapers yesterday continued their anti-Finnish campaign, announcing the demands recently made by the Soviet government during negotiations with Finland. These can be divided into the following three points: (1) The Soviet-Finnish border in Karelia should be pushed north, giving the Soviet Union a naval base, and at the same time preventing Finnish land forces outside the border from attacking Leningrad with artillery fire. (2) The Soviet Union intends to establish submarine bases on two peninsulas bordering Finland, but Finland itself is unable to defend these peninsulas, nor can it fortify them. (3) The Soviet line of defense should be bounded by the Gulf of Finland, including not only Hanko Island but also the seven small islands near the Soviet naval port, as the Soviet Union is determined not to allow Leningrad to be threatened by land, sea, and air. (Haitong, 18th)

Hyde Park City, USA - Soviet newspapers published news that the Finnish government's tough stance in negotiations with the Soviet Union was due to the United States government's promise of economic and financial assistance. President Roosevelt stated to the press here that he denied ever making such a promise, only saying that the Finnish government had indeed requested a loan in the United States a few months ago to build a railway, and the United States government immediately asked them to contact private banks in New York directly. It is not surprising that Finland negotiated loans with American banks, as this "is within the country's rights." (Havas, 17th)

### Soviet Anti-Japanese Fighters Decorated for Merit

Moscow - The Supreme Soviet today awarded the Order of Lenin to the Red Army soldiers who fought against the Japanese army in the Nomonhan region. The Order of Lenin is the highest Soviet order.

### British Pound Falls in New York Foreign Exchange Market

New York - The New York foreign exchange market saw the British pound fall to its lowest level this year due to rumors that the authorities would allow the pound to fall to $3.75 or even $3.50 by the end of the year. The opening price was $3.89875, and the closing price was $3.90125. The one-month forward discount was 2.5, and the three-month forward discount was 6.25. The foreign exchange market is paying close attention to the closer economic union between Britain and France. According to some observers, this move will weaken the pound further, or that the decline in forward exchange rates is due to speculators switching to forwards because current rates are difficult to manipulate. Selling current rates to buy forwards can be profitable at current market prices, but few banks are willing to do so. At the same time, according to private sources in London, neutral countries have very little money left in London, and it may be exhausted in a few weeks. The pounds obtained from selling goods to Britain are also scarce because Britain now pays extra for imports compared to before the war, or obtains relief from British investors selling American securities. The value of the Canadian dollar also fell, closing today at $4.46125, due to news that Canada is purchasing large amounts of military supplies in the United States. (Reuters, 17th)

### Close Economic Ties Between Britain and France; Establishing a Strong War Machine; Setting Up a Standing Executive Committee to Handle Important Decisions of the Supreme Defense Council

London - The Anglo-French Supreme Military Council held its third meeting in London since the start of the war today, reviewing the general military situation and its possible future developments. Among the matters discussed were methods of jointly utilizing the British and French forces to achieve maximum effectiveness, and avoiding competition in overseas procurement of military supplies. All resolutions were handed over to the Anglo-French Adjustment Committee, which will be established immediately, for implementation. The French side attending the meeting included Prime Minister Daladier, Allied Commander-in-Chief Gamelin, Naval Commander-in-Chief Darlan, and Air Force Commander-in-Chief Vuillemin. The British side included Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, Minister for Coordination of Defense Chatfield, and Air Minister Wood. The French representatives arrived in Britain by plane and met with the British representatives at a designated location within an hour of their arrival. Few people knew about it, but when they left the meeting, a small number of onlookers outside cheered the British and French dignitaries. British Prime Minister Chamberlain left his home after being ill for the first time. He walked with a cane when he got into the car.

Press Release

After the meeting, the British and French leaders issued a joint communiqué stating that, in order to actively utilize the experience gained from 1914 to 1918, the British and French governments decided from the beginning of the war to adjust the economic war efforts of the two countries to the greatest possible extent. Therefore, as soon as the war started, both sides immediately took steps to achieve this goal. The arrangements previously implemented by the two governments have now been further strengthened and completed in accordance with the resolutions established by Chamberlain and Daladier at the last meeting of the Supreme Military Council. Common actions have been taken in all aspects of the sky, munitions, raw materials, oil, food, shipping, and economic warfare. The new plan adopted by the two governments will stipulate the best use of raw materials, production methods, and ship tonnage for the common benefit, and will also stipulate the equal distribution of any restricted goods in the event of circumstances requiring a reduction in the import process. The two countries will jointly prepare import procedures in the future and avoid competition in overseas procurement during the implementation of these procedures. All of this implementation work has been handed over to the Anglo-French Permanent Executive Committee for handling, and this Executive Committee will be subordinate to the Anglo-French Adjustment Committee, which will be organized immediately. If necessary, these methods can be extended to other areas, and the determination of Britain and France to unify and cooperate their war efforts to the greatest possible extent can be further demonstrated. All arrangements for organizing the joint action of the two countries, which were only realized in the final struggle of the third year of the last war, have now been implemented in this way within two months of the start of the war. (Reuters, 17th)

### British and French Newspapers Unanimously Praise

London - The decisions made by the Anglo-French Joint Defense Conference have been commented on by various newspapers, which say that the two allied countries of Britain and France can therefore be confident of victory, and that the economic institutions of all countries in the world during and after the war will also be positively influenced by this. An editorial in "The Times" said that Britain and France took nearly four years to establish a united relationship during the last European war. This time, the war has lasted less than three months, and the belligerent parties have not yet directly clashed, but Britain and France have already achieved such results, which is something to celebrate. The two countries have now established a comprehensive alliance relationship, and the unpleasant feelings caused by one party wanting to protect its currency and restrict the other party's imports can also be easily removed. In short, the economic, military, and diplomatic cooperation between Britain and France has achieved results. Not only can they be confident of victory, but also the economic prosperity and orderly progress after the war will be easier to achieve. (Havas, 18th)

London - "Le Petit Parisien" said today that the economic cooperation method established by the Anglo-French Supreme Military Council is an unprecedented agreement in history, which can reduce the war expenses of the two countries. The famous reporter Bertina published an article in "L'Ordre," pointing out that this agreement between Britain and France can serve as a precedent for future European or global cooperation after the war.

### Chamberlain Attends Meeting While Ill

Amsterdam - It has been learned here that British Prime Minister Chamberlain attended the Anglo-French Allied Supreme Defense Council held in London yesterday for the first time after being ill. One of his feet was still swollen and he could not wear shoes. He was wearing a slipper, walking unsteadily with a cane. After the meeting, Chamberlain hosted a banquet for the delegates at the Carlton Hotel. (Haitong, 18th)

### Western Front: Germany Waits for Opportunity to Attack; Hitler Willing to Take a Gamble; Differences in Opinion with the Conservative Faction

London - Well-informed sources here recently said that, according to news from various neutral countries, German leader Hitler has decided to concentrate his forces to attack the French Maginot Line as a last resort. The scale of the attack will be unprecedented, and therefore the future of the entire Europe will depend on this. Although Hitler said in a recent speech in Munich that he had instructed Air Force Minister General Goering to prepare for five years of war, he still believed that the only way for the country to win was through a "swift victory." Military leaders generally consider large-scale offensives to be too risky, saying that regardless of success or failure, the number of casualties among officers and soldiers will be high. This major loss alone is enough to demoralize the military. If the attack fails, the entire national defense mechanism that the country has painstakingly built up over the years will be destroyed in one fell swoop. Therefore, although they have not openly opposed it, they have tried their best to dissuade him. However, Hitler himself has not abandoned this plan, saying that if the current war is prolonged for more than a year, the "iron clamp strategy" adopted by Britain and France will be enough to subdue Germany. Rather than waiting to die and allowing Germany to be defeated by the Allied forces, it is better to preemptively strike while the British Expeditionary Force has not yet been deployed in large numbers to the mainland, and the main force on the Western Front is only the French army, in order to win the war in one battle. Hitler's argument is thus, and his views are clearly very different from those of the conservative faction in the military. It is not difficult to imagine that the two sides are arguing fiercely. In short, Hitler intends to concentrate the country's infantry, artillery, mechanized units, and air force in one corner of the Western Front to attack the Maginot Line, similar to the Battle of Verdun in the last European war, until the enemy forces are unable to resist. At the same time, during the offensive, he will send a small number of aircraft to bomb Britain in an attempt to shake morale, and send a large number of submarines to attack the British fleet in order to achieve surprising results in naval warfare to boost morale. Commentators here say that this plan is brave but has little hope of success, because with the strength of the British and French Allied forces, no matter what offensive Germany takes, it will not be difficult to give them a head-on blow. (Havas, 17th)

Paris - "Le Petit Parisien" today published an essay by military reporter Maurice, saying that "to attack or not to attack is the question that keeps Hitler awake at night. It seems that the instructions given by Hitler to the general staff are 'prepare and wait.'" It is speculated that there are many reasons why the German side is not active, namely, internal worries have not subsided, military officers have conflicting opinions, the climate is not suitable, and military preparations have not matured. All these reasons are possible. One can also say that Hitler is now waiting for a miracle to happen, but in wartime, miracles only appear when armies are fighting, as in the Battle of the Marne in the last Great War. We cannot but be grateful for the current inactive situation, because it allows our preparations to be completed. Next spring, our strength will be unmatched. In order to prevent the German attack, the strong French army guarding the front line between the Rhine and the Moselle Rivers sends scouts and reconnaissance teams to spy on enemy positions several times every twenty-four hours. Yesterday, this team encountered a small enemy team, so there were frequent contacts east of the Moselle River, but there were no important developments. German patrols had to retreat under French artillery fire. We are now prepared to spend the winter in inactivity. If war tactics require us to defend the trenches for three years to subdue the enemy, then we would rather do this than make any unnecessary sacrifices of French people. This is also the prospect of the soldiers on the front line." (Reuters, 18th)

### British Secretary of War Arrives in France to Inspect the Front Line

London - A Reuters correspondent accompanying the British Expeditionary Force to France cabled that British Secretary of War Belisha arrived at a station near the headquarters at 9:15 last night. British Commander-in-Chief Viscount Gort greeted him on the platform and then led him to a villa. Belisha is currently inspecting the British and French military positions and will go to Paris in a few days to meet with French political and military leaders. (Reuters, 18th)

Paris - A recent French communiqué stated that there were local contacts and artillery activity on the front line. (Reuters, 17th)

### Air Raid Alarms Frequently Sounded in British and French Cities; German Aircraft Drop Leaflets and Cotton Bombs - Another Form of Psychological Warfare

Paris - According to news obtained by reporters today, German aircraft that raided northern and eastern France this week often dropped leaflets, and yesterday they dropped cotton bombs. German aircraft flew very high to avoid anti-aircraft fire, and they dropped several tons of cotton bombs. Blown by the wind, they landed on a very large area of ground. After the French recovered these cotton bombs, they conducted chemical tests, but did not find any chemicals inside. According to general observation, the German dropping of cotton bombs is another form of Hitler's psychological warfare. (United Press, 18th)

London - The Ministry of Aviation recently released news that an air raid alarm was issued in the northwest of the country this morning. Several enemy aircraft appeared in the sky near Manchester without dropping bombs. Local anti-aircraft artillery immediately opened fire, and several fighters also took off and drove the enemy aircraft away. In addition, air raid alarms were issued in thirteen cities in England and Scotland, and in the Shetland Islands in northern Scotland this morning. (Havas, 17th)

Paris - An air raid alarm was issued in southern France today from 9:30 AM to 11:10 AM. In Marseille, an alarm was issued from 11:35 AM and lifted at 12:25 PM. At 2:15 PM, the area issued a second alarm, and the sound of anti-aircraft artillery could be heard in the distance. A German aircraft flew over the Annecy area of Haute-Savoie during the day. (Reuters, 17th)

Paris - Air raid alarms were issued today in the western city of Poitiers, the central cities of Clermont-Ferrand and Châteauroux, the northern city of Dunkirk, and the eastern cities of Annecy and Annemasse. Anti-aircraft artillery opened fire, but the enemy aircraft did not drop bombs. (Havas, 17th)

Épinal, France - Several German aircraft flew over the Vosges Mountains in northeastern France yesterday afternoon. French fighter groups immediately took off to intercept them. A German aircraft has been forced to land, and all the pilots have been captured. (Havas, 18th)

### Aircraft of Belligerent Countries Violate Neutrality; Belgian Newspaper Publishes Article Acknowledging Inability to Prevent It

Beijing - A German aircraft flew over the city of Ghent in Belgium this morning. Anti-aircraft artillery immediately opened fire, and the German aircraft flew away. (Havas, 17th)

Bern - A communiqué released here said that foreign aircraft were found dropping anti-British French leaflets in several parts of Swiss airspace. (Reuters, 18th)

Beijing - There were rumors that the Belgian government was allowing foreign military aircraft to fly over the country without interception. The semi-official Belgian news agency published a statement today denying this, saying: "It is true that aircraft from various belligerent countries have frequently flown over our national airspace in recent days, but it is also true that our anti-aircraft artillery and fighter aircraft have immediately dispatched to intercept them whenever possible. Moreover, according to our national authorities, even the major belligerent countries themselves cannot prevent enemy aircraft from attacking their hinterland one by one. Therefore, it is even more difficult for Belgium to prevent foreign military aircraft from flying over its airspace. (Havas, 17th)

### British Shipbuilding Industry Active; 150 Merchant Ships Under Construction; Germany Lacks Both Raw Materials and Labor

London - The British shipbuilding industry is currently very active, and all shipyards are operating at full capacity. The Admiralty has indeed ordered a lot of ships, but this does not account for the majority of the shipbuilding industry's activity. It is estimated that there are currently more than 150 ships under construction in Britain. Whenever a new ship is launched and space is freed up, the keel of another new ship is immediately laid, and work does not stop. Recent German broadcasts have claimed that Germany has replaced Britain as the world's largest shipbuilding country and the most important supplier of ships. Observers here scoff at this, saying that the only possible basis for this German exaggeration is that Germany is selling its useless merchant ships that are currently berthed in neutral ports. Germany may be the largest supplier of ships in this short period of time, because many German ships berthed in neutral ports are not only useless, but also increase Germany's troubles in paying mooring fees, etc., due to the shortage of foreign currency. It is better to sell them. As for the German shipbuilding industry, it is well known that the German shipbuilding industry is facing great difficulties due to the lack of both labor and raw materials, and the German navy urgently needs to build submarines to compensate for losses. At the same time, neutral shipping companies are unwilling to order new ships from Germany due to the attacks on neutral ships by German submarines. The uncertainty of the delivery time, the lack of attention to materials and labor, and the possible dangers at the time of delivery also make neutral countries afraid to order ships from Germany. (Reuters, 18th)

### British Ship Sunk in Portuguese Territorial Waters; Work of German Pocket Battleship

Lourenço Marques - The crew of the British ship "Africa Hill," which was sunk by a German warship in Portuguese territorial waters 180 miles northeast of here on Thursday, identified a photo of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Scheer" today as the German warship that sank their ship. (Reuters, 18th)

### 15 Finnish Merchant Ships Intercepted by German Warships; Request for Release Unsuccessful

Helsinki - It has been learned that at least 15 Finnish ships have been intercepted by German warships, ordered to sail to German ports, and detained. The goods carried by these ships were all transported to neutral countries, especially to the United States. They were intercepted by German warships when sailing to the Falsterbo Strait south of Sweden. The Finnish government has repeatedly made representations to the German government to request release, but to no effect. (Havas, 17th)

### French Next Year's Fiscal Budget Submitted to the Finance Committees of Both Houses

Paris - Finance Minister Reynaud sent the following year's budget explanatory memorandum to the Finance Committees of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies today. The revenue sector totaled 79,031,083,112 francs, and the expenditure sector totaled 78,995,035,783 francs. The balance between revenue and expenditure showed a surplus of 36,047,329 francs. Finance Minister Reynaud then added the explanation that "the government's cooperation with the parliament has put the plan for financial and economic recovery into practice, and our country's ability to calmly respond to the war is due to this."

### Population Exchange and Withdrawal of Residents from Soviet and German Occupied Zones Has Been Agreed to by Both Parties

Moscow - It has been heard that the German and Soviet authorities have reached an agreement on the withdrawal of German residents from the Polish territory occupied by the Soviet Union, and the return of Soviet and Ukrainian residents from German territory to Soviet territory. Therefore, there are about 1 million Soviet people and about 115,000 German people who will be relocated, but this is a voluntary relocation and not forced. It is heard that the first batch of 500 German households have left the Limburg area of southern Poland. (Reuters, 18th)

### The German Social Party Suppresses and the Czechs Riot: Anti-German Demonstrations Held in Prague; Universities Closed and Students Arrested

Capital of Switzerland. According to informed sources here, the events that have recently occurred in Prague, Bohemia Province, are of an "extremely serious nature" and are indicative of the unrest in the area. This was also acknowledged by the German semi-official news agency, the German News Agency, which reported that a large number of Czechs in Bohemia and Moravia had been executed by German authorities, and a large number had been arrested. (Havas, 17th)

Danzig. Yesterday, hundreds of people demonstrated and marched in the center of Prague, resulting in serious disturbances. Nine Czechs have been shot and killed and a large number arrested. When the police intervened in the demonstration, many people were seriously injured. According to the German official news agency, the Czechs attempted to disrupt public order in the Protectorate (Bohemia and Moravia) with "various resistance activities of different scales," resulting in executions and arrests. Some Czech intellectuals and those close to Beneš (the last Czech president) have been trying to disrupt public order for some time. Several incidents have occurred in universities, and these schools have now been ordered to close for three years. (Reuters, 18th)

Capital of Yugoslavia. According to news from Prague, the tribal president of the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, Hácha, refused to sign an order to mobilize one million Czechs to serve in the German army, which angered the Protectorate's governor, Neurath, who immediately placed him under house arrest in Lány Castle. (Havas, 17th)

New York. The oppressive measures taken by Germany in Bohemia and Moravia have aroused indignation in American public opinion. The Democratic New York Times reported, "The residents of Prague are spending another night in terror." The Republican New York Herald Tribune reported, "Hitler shamelessly claims that the goal of this war is to free Europe from the shackles of Britain. The absurdity of this statement is clearly demonstrated by the events that took place in Prague yesterday." (Havas, 18th)

Prague. Nine students in the Bohemia-Moravia Protectorate were arrested for leading anti-German demonstrations, sentenced by a military court, and executed by firing squad. The military court also issued a decree ordering the closure of all universities. (Reuters, 18th)

The Hague. News recently received from the Austrian border states that the German authorities in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia have taken various measures to completely assimilate the Czechs and Germans, and use anti-Semitic laws to send German personnel to supervise businesses run by Czechs. All Czech workers in major arms factories are also being replaced by German workers as much as possible. On the other hand, after the Germans from the Baltic Sea countries withdrew to their homeland, a portion of them were settled by the German authorities in areas inhabited by Czechs. The families of German military officers stationed in the country have also been ordered to go to Bohemia and Moravia. Many schools run by Czechs have been ordered to close by the German authorities, and the school buildings have been requisitioned for military use. In the schools that are still open, German is a required subject. However, the Czechs are strongly resisting Germanization, and demonstrations are seen almost daily. (Havas, 18th)

Paris. It is heard that thousands of leaflets were distributed in Prague today, stating that the Munich bombing was carried out by the German secret police to incite hatred of Britain among the German people. It is also heard that the leaflets contained speeches by British Prime Minister Chamberlain, French Premier Daladier, and former Czech President Beneš. (Reuters, 18th)

Paris. According to sources in France, Czech Protectorate President Hácha is now effectively confined to Lány Palace for administrative reasons. It is believed that Berlin asked President Hácha to sign an order mobilizing one million Czechs to be incorporated into the German army in a ratio of three Germans to one Czech. However, Hácha refused to sign it, so the Germans placed Hácha under house arrest. According to news from the Austrian border, six thousand Czechs were arrested the day after the Munich bombing, and six hundred of them have been sent to concentration camps. (Reuters, 18th)

London. Former Czech President Beneš gave a speech in London today on the terror in the Czech Republic, saying that as Germany's situation becomes more difficult, its methods of terror become more cruel. However, the Czechs will never cease their resistance. The shooting of Czech students is reminiscent of the situation in Belgium during the last World War. This crime will have a great impact on Czech public opinion. (Reuters, 18th)

Capital of the Netherlands. The 28th of last month was the national day of Czechoslovakia. Czechs held demonstrations in Prague and clashed with German political police, resulting in many deaths and injuries. The "People's Daily" here has recently published a lengthy dispatch describing the events, stating that "the clash between demonstrators and political police resulted in many deaths and injuries, and several policemen were thrown into the river by the crowd, causing a political uproar. Hundreds of Czechs have been arrested as a result. Himmler, the director of the German political police, immediately went to Prague to inspect the situation. He was deeply dissatisfied with the way the local political police, the stormtroopers of the Social Party, and the security forces handled the incident. In his opinion, the political police and stormtroopers did not need to open fire at the time. It would be in Germany's interest to make the outside world believe that the Protectorate is peaceful and quiet. On the contrary, if the Protectorate experiences turmoil, it will cause a bad impression abroad. After Himmler returned from his inspection, Neurath, the highest official of the Protectorate, immediately met with Czech President Hácha and informed him that the German authorities had decided not to pursue the demonstrators and that all others arrested in the case would also be released. However, the Czechs must express their 'loyalty' to Germany within a short period of time in order to eliminate the negative impression caused by the incident. Neurath even proposed several measures to President Hácha: (1) revise the current borders of Bohemia and Moravia to benefit the Czechs; (2) change the legal status of the provinces, in other words, change the Protectorate into a republic subordinate to Germany; (3) the government of this republic should issue a declaration of loyalty to Germany, thereby formally declaring war on Britain and France (even a symbolic declaration of war would be acceptable), and at the same time, Czech troops should be trained and placed under German command. All of this has been rejected by President Hácha. The German authorities then claimed that President Hácha was 'overworked' and 'advised' him to return to his villa in Lány Castle to rest fully, while taking the necessary measures to prevent him from being disturbed by the outside world (i.e., placing him under house arrest). The above is the current situation in Bohemia and Moravia. How it will evolve in the future is difficult to predict. If Germany were to abolish the Protectorate and directly incorporate the provinces into its territory, it would inevitably cause a bad impression abroad, and it seems unwilling to do so for the time being. However, it is generally believed that President Hácha and his government will be replaced by puppets selected by Berlin." (Havas)

### Foreign Military Advisors Suggest Limited Destruction of Highways; Chinese Army's General Counteroffensive Requires Heavy Weapons and Highways Will Be Used for Necessary Transportation

Hong Kong. Foreign military advisors in Chongqing have suggested to the Chongqing military authorities that China's passive defense strategy of completely destroying all transportation in various war zones to prevent further Japanese advances will be an obstacle to China's long-prepared general counteroffensive. This action, which concerns the Chinese army's strategic methods, can render the Japanese army's current superior tanks, heavy artillery, and light artillery ineffective, and was a key factor in China's recent repulse of the Japanese invasion in northern Hunan. The Japanese army's disastrous defeat in northern Hubei in April of this year was also mainly due to the Chinese army's destruction of transportation. In addition, the Chinese army in southern Shanxi and central Shanxi also used the same method to thwart the Japanese army's nine "mopping-up" operations, preparing to cross the Yellow River and invade Shaanxi. When the Japanese army fought in the plains of eastern and central China, the Japanese tanks, armored vehicles, cavalry, and artillery roamed freely on excellent highways. When the Japanese army attacked Xuzhou, the Japanese "rapid forces" cut off the Chinese army's divisions, cut off their retreat, and encircled the Chinese army's strong positions. When the Japanese army was unable to advance due to the Yellow River breach, the Japanese army used the Yangtze River as an easy route to attack Hankou.

The situation is no longer the same today. One year after the fall of Hankou, the Chinese army has implemented a systematic plan to destroy highways, focusing on defense methods in mountainous areas. As a result, the Japanese army cannot use heavy weapons, putting them on an equal footing with the Chinese army, forming the current stalemate. When the reporter recently inspected the front line in Changsha, he saw that the ancient roads built by China over the ages were completely destroyed. The highways that previously carried trucks are now planted with rice. Where highways cannot be destroyed, the Chinese army has dug large holes, 30 to 40 feet deep, some of which are filled with two or three feet of water. Next to them are high mountains or rice paddies, which can prevent vehicles from advancing on either side of the highway. All of these measures are being implemented in mountainous areas. The only transportation line in these areas is a small road only two feet wide. The Chinese army is carrying out the same defense plan in areas from Changsha to Hengyang. According to Chinese military experts, when the Japanese army attacked Changsha, they could not transport mountain guns, tanks, or heavy artillery across the Xinqiang River. Artillery and tanks cannot travel on small roads. The Japanese army cannot use other roads to advance. As a result, the Chinese army, armed with machine guns, rifles, and some mountain guns, fought the Japanese army, who were armed similarly. The Chinese divisions, who were experienced in mobile warfare, were able to concentrate in relevant positions according to strategy, even with Japanese aircraft reconnaissance in the air. Sometimes, to avoid Japanese aerial reconnaissance, the Chinese army could move 50 miles in one night. These lightly armed Chinese soldiers can fight for several days without relying on anything other than rice. They all wear straw sandals and can climb mountains as if walking on flat ground, which is much faster than the Japanese army wearing leather boots. Therefore, they were able to quickly execute the Chinese army headquarters' operational orders and defeat the Japanese army in one fell swoop. On the contrary, the Japanese army was unfamiliar with the mountainous terrain, lost their way, and were attacked by the Chinese army from all sides, forcing them to make a "strategic retreat." Chinese military authorities have said that the Chinese army can rely

greatly on manpower to transport munitions and food to the front lines to meet the needs of the Chinese army. At the same time, foreign advisors told reporters that the Chinese army on the front lines in northern Hunan has never felt a shortage of ammunition. Thousands of laborers carry munitions and food to the front lines on their shoulders or in old handcarts. This situation will not lead to a shortage of munitions on the front lines unless foreign supplies are cut off or domestic munitions are depleted. However, when the Chinese army launches a counteroffensive in the future, if it wants to recapture Hankou, it must tactically use heavy artillery, tanks, light artillery, and thousands of tons of munitions. Therefore, while destroying transportation for defense is ideal, it will reduce the strength of the counteroffensive when the Chinese army

launches a major counteroffensive. Chinese sources have said that China's great manpower can transport all the munitions needed by the Chinese army to the front lines for use in a major counteroffensive in the future. The Chinese can also rebuild major highways to facilitate the movement of heavy trucks and the transportation of heavy artillery. However, in the view of foreign advisors, this project will take several years to complete. A French advisor said that if the destruction of highways does not exceed the limit, it can be quite appropriate for defense. He said, "The Chinese army does not yet have a definite date for a large-scale counteroffensive. The Chinese army will continue to wage defensive warfare, but hopes that the international situation will change before deciding on the definite date for its major counteroffensive."

### Japanese Army Retreats Near Jiuling

Miluo. More than 300 Japanese cavalrymen invaded the vicinity of Jiuling from Tongcheng on the 14th. After a fierce attack by the Chinese army, the Japanese were defeated and retreated. More than 100 Japanese were killed in the battle. (18th Daily Telegram)

### Xinhua Daily Warns the United States

Chongqing. Xinhua Daily, the organ of the Chinese Communist Party, today urged the United States to take strong measures against Japan, stating that since the United States has adopted a neutral stance toward the European war, there is no need to concentrate its fleet in the Atlantic. Therefore, its position in the Pacific has become much stronger. The newspaper urged the US government and capitalists not to forget the importance of the United States' position in the Far East and not to allow Japan to establish hegemony in the Far East. It also said that although the United States can profit greatly by supplying munitions to European countries, the United States should not forget the consequences of the last World War. Therefore, for the sake of the United States, it should focus entirely on the Pacific, because only in this region does the United States have unlimited trade and investment opportunities. The newspaper continued that the United States can be tough on Japan without any hesitation. Japanese newspapers regard the United States' actions, such as naval activities and expansion, and Pittman's proposals for sanctions against Japan, as an aggressive attitude towards Japan and criticize them. However, Japanese politicians are constantly flattering the United States in order to win its friendship. This shows that the United States is in a pivotal position in the Far East. Finally, the newspaper regarded the actions of Britain and France in withdrawing their troops stationed in North China as concessions to Japan. (United Press, 16th)

### Siamese Government Strictly Discriminating Against Chinese, Thousands of Overseas Chinese Arrested, All Schools Closed, Overseas Chinese Forced to Speak Siamese

Hong Kong Correspondence. The Siamese government is taking very active measures to discriminate against Chinese. It is estimated that over 100 people have been deported in the past month alone, including Wu Biyan, the president of the Bangkok National Daily and executive member of the Kuomintang's general branch in Thailand, and Liang Weicheng, a local celebrity. Recently, each Siamese ship arriving in Hong Kong has been carrying an average of 30 to 40 people. The Meixi Meilun, which arrived in Hong Kong yesterday, also carried over 30 overseas Chinese who had been deported, mostly from Chaozhou, and mostly teachers from overseas Chinese schools and those in charge of overseas Chinese organizations. According to them, the Siamese government has recently arrested thousands of overseas Chinese. Over a thousand were arrested in October, and the reasons are still unknown. They include presidents of social organizations, businessmen, teachers, and shop clerks. All Chinese newspapers in Thailand have been closed, and only one Chinese newspaper remains. The overseas Chinese community is extremely uneasy, and the business community is suffering great fluctuations and huge commercial losses. There are over 100 Chinese primary and secondary schools in Thailand, most of which have now been closed by the Siamese government. Only two or three small schools of no significance remain. The Siamese government not only closes schools but also forces Chinese children to wear Siamese clothes, speak Siamese, and attend Siamese schools to learn Siamese. It is estimated that about 230,000 overseas Chinese students in Thailand have lost their schooling, and some have already returned to Kunming to request government accommodation. Most of the overseas Chinese who have been discriminated against are those who donated money to return to their country and were arrested.

### Foreign Merchants in the Yangtze River Trade Subjected to Exclusion

Former Trading Ports Now Ruins

Correspondent's dispatch from a certain area of the Yangtze River basin for the English-language "Great American Evening Post" states: The number of foreigners here is roughly the same as before the Sino-Japanese War. The foreign commercial district of the past is now mostly a pile of rubble. From the phenomena observed, the Japanese are currently excluding foreign commerce. Foreign merchants cannot operate not because of the conditions here, but because the Japanese do not want foreign merchants here. Some parts of the city have returned to normal, but other parts are still

in ruins

Many shops have been slightly repaired and reopened. Although there are enough goods in stock, the prices are so high that most people cannot afford them. Apples now sell for 60 cents a pound, and less than two catties of kerosene cost one yuan. Poor business is inevitable. Sidewalks have been paved on both sides of the main street. The work is shoddy, but homeowners facing the main street have been ordered to pay street paving fees, which are very high. Although homeowners can pave better roads at a lower cost, they are not allowed to do so themselves. The Japanese monopoly of import and export is a major obstacle to commercial recovery. For example, if a shop wants to obtain goods from Shanghai, it must obtain a permit. Goods brought here without a permit will be confiscated. This move greatly hinders the flow of goods. According to one merchant, the tax levied by this agency on foreign goods is several times higher than that levied on the same Japanese goods. It is difficult for Chinese businessmen to make a small profit, so the situation here

is still quite bleak

Rice, wheat, and other grains are also monopolized, bought from farmers at extremely low prices and sold to city dwellers at exorbitant prices. One example is that flour sells for more than seven yuan per bag. Fuel is very expensive, and coal is almost impossible to obtain. Electricity costs from 20 to 35 cents per kilowatt-hour. Street lighting is dim, and robberies occur frequently. When alarms sound, the police and others never come to help. The Japanese secretly control everything, and even schools and churches are monitored by Japanese puppets. Church sermons must also be reported to the military police in advance, including the time, location, and number of people. American and British expatriates are

quite indignant

at this interference with religious and freedom of speech. Japanese in plain clothes or semi-military uniforms often go to shops with armed Japanese soldiers and force shop owners to buy narcotics and other items. Their attitudes are fierce, and shop owners dare not refuse. Another group of Japanese often comes soon after to force sales or "borrow money". Those who are asked dare not refuse. Since the situation has been like this before, it is not surprising that there are very few people who are enthusiastic about the "New Order in East Asia."

### British Malaya Restricts Remittances and Imports

Fuzhou Correspondence. Since the rise in foreign exchange rates, remittances from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia to China have been very active. The average monthly remittances to Fujian province are in the range of six to seven hundred thousand yuan. In September of this year alone, the remittances received by private letter offices in Quanzhou reached more than five million yuan, of which more than 2.1 million yuan were from the Philippines, more than 1.1 million yuan from Singapore, more than 800,000 yuan from Penang, more than 500,000 yuan from Java, more than 120,000 yuan from Sumatra, more than 110,000 yuan from Celebes, more than 100,000 yuan from Annam, more than 80,000 yuan from Burma, more than 50,000 yuan from Siam, more than 30,000 yuan from Borneo, and more than 10,000 yuan from other territories. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have enthusiastically promoted the use of domestic goods. Due to the war, the sales of domestic agricultural and industrial products in the occupied areas have been completely cut off, and most of them are being transported to Southeast Asia for sale. Therefore, during this war of resistance, the economies of Southeast Asia and China are very closely linked. However, since the outbreak of the European war, the governments of British Malaya have strictly restricted remittances and imports, which has suddenly affected the support of overseas Chinese families in China, making their lives very difficult. The sales of domestic goods have also suddenly stagnated. According to investigations, there are more than 120 large-scale Chinese businesses in British Malayan cities engaged in the import of domestic goods. Most of their goods are produced by Shanghai and Hong Kong Chinese factories, among which silk, cosmetics, tobacco, alcohol, porcelain, electrical materials, and leather goods sell the best. After these restrictions, factories in Hong Kong and Shanghai have suffered major setbacks. The Chinese Consulate General in Singapore has lodged a protest with the government of the British Straits Settlements. The British government has now adopted a lenient approach to overseas Chinese remittances, allowing each overseas Chinese to remit a maximum of 500 Straits dollars per transaction (currently, 15.75 Straits dollars can be converted to 100 legal tender, and 54 Straits dollars can be converted to 100 Hong Kong dollars). Donations from overseas Chinese organizations and individuals to the motherland can be handled flexibly and are not subject to this restriction. The removal of import restrictions is still under negotiation.

### Li Yichen Scores a Hat-Trick, Lido Defeats Westports 3-1, Lineup Change Immediately Becomes Lively, Group A with Four Wins in Four Matches Leading the Pack

In the Westports League Group A match, Lido leads the pack with four wins in four matches. As a result of yesterday's match, they defeated Westports 3-1. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw. There were only 500 to 600 spectators at the Yiyuan Stadium, a bleak scene. This is because Westports has repeatedly lost matches in this season, and their strength is mediocre. Lido, on the other hand, had previously announced that their main players were absent and would be playing with a weakened team, and they were unwilling to announce their lineup. Indeed, Lido's main forwards Sun Jinshun and Huang Kehou were both absent, resulting in a lack of leadership, which led to Westports scoring first. Fortunately, Yan Shixin's penalty kick was missed by Westports, otherwise they would have been trailing 2-0. Lido quickly changed their lineup, and Jiang Chao was moved to left winger, and the front line immediately became lively. Veteran Li Yichen showed his skills and scored the first goal, tying the score in the first half. In the second half, he scored two more goals with powerful shots, a hat-trick, working very hard. Li's attack is better than his defense. If it weren't for Yichen, they would have been defeated yesterday. Westports is old and fading, and there is nothing good to report.

Equal in the First Half

Westports kicked off. After seven minutes, Lido attacked. Wu Qixiang received a pass from Xu Wenkui and shot diagonally from 15 yards, low and fast, but unfortunately it went just outside the post. Then, Xu Wenkui tapped the ball near the goal, hitting the left post and bouncing out, sounding like a cannonball. It was a pity that it was less than ten yards from the goal. After 26 minutes, Yan Shixin fought for the ball with the opponent's right winger on the baseline. After intercepting it, he didn't kick it far enough. McLone passed the ball in the middle, and Li Yichen was unable to retreat in time. He deflected the ball backwards, and as Lu Zhongen was about to catch up, Ukraine had already rushed in. Less than three yards from the goal, Shixin saw that the situation was critical and stepped forward to tackle, resulting in a penalty kick. McLone took the penalty kick, but it flew high over the goal. Lido was spared from danger. After 37 minutes, Ukraine's free kick hit Li Yichen's body and bounced out. Ukraine passed the ball to the front of the goal again, and McLone headed it in. Chui Jiuen was unable to save it, and Lido lost a goal. At this time, Li Yichen was transferred to center forward, and the attack became stronger. In less than a minute, Li went straight to the opponent's goal and tied the score. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw, with no winner yet.

Lido's Triumph

The second half started, and Lido's forwards, led by Li Yichen, launched a fierce attack on the opponent's camp. However, Westports' defense was strong, making it difficult to penetrate. Cao Qiuting was closely guarded, and Zhang Mingsheng had no chance to get the ball. The forwards repeatedly tried to break through the middle, but were unsuccessful. After 18 minutes, Wenkui passed the ball to Li Yichen, who swept the ball with his left foot from 20 yards. Walter missed the save, and the ball went straight into the left corner, a clear and beautiful shot. Lido took the lead. Before long, Jiang Zhaoxiang committed a foul. Pete took a free kick from 30 yards and shot remotely at the goal. The ball came with great force, and Zhongen knelt down and held it. Two minutes before the end of the game, Cao Qiuting crossed the ball, and Li Yichen scored his third goal, setting a hat-trick record. Westports was defeated by Lido 3-1.

### Food Grain Rice Prices Soar by Three to Four Yuan What Kind of Situation Is This… Nothing More Than Speculation Allegedly to Reward Rice Vendors… Skillful at Covering Up

Yesterday, the sources of rice grains from various routes became more active, with more than 30 trucks of Kuntai goods arriving, as well as more than 20 trucks of Su, Tong, Qingfeng, and other goods. However, the rising trend in the market did not show any signs of abating, and became even more intense. Speculators had ulterior motives, and cargo owners were even more reluctant to release samples easily. As buyers from all sides sought it more eagerly, it created a situation of rising prices step by step yesterday. Rice merchants and vendors, fearing being scolded, were fortunately able to use news propaganda, even saying that this rise was a strategy to reward vendors for bringing in goods, so they specially raised the selling price to cover up their manipulation, which can be said to be good at covering up. The opening price rose by one yuan, and then it was raised higher and higher, to two or three yuan. At this time, speculators suddenly took the opportunity to sell at a high price, so the mid-market slightly weakened, but ultimately the recovery was not large, and it suddenly returned to its original state. Unexpectedly, after this suppression, it became even more intensified. Regardless of whether it was Japonica or Indica, the highest price was actually as much as four yuan higher than the previous market price. General customers suddenly changed their style and shifted their attention to the kiln tea variety, which lacked large-scale sales. Therefore, as the price of this product was still lower than other products, they also deliberately sought it, resulting in a closing price of 33 yuan, also up three yuan. In addition, the closing price of Changbang Special Japonica reached 36 yuan, Kunsu White Japonica also reached 34 yuan and 45 cents, Special Luyang Indica 33-34 yuan, Jiangbei Indica and Jingwu Indica 32.5-32 yuan, all rose sharply by three to four yuan compared to the previous market price. Yinbian Yuan, because the path to market is not as wide as other products, is two yuan higher, Chen is 36 yuan, Xin is 34-35 yuan, and Yin Yuan is 33-34 yuan.

Yesterday's market for Ke Xian rice was even more prosperous, because there were reports that Japanese merchants were directly exporting rice from the production areas, so the daily arrival volume decreased. Chinese merchants were still restricted, and Jiangbei Xian rice was inconvenient to transport. The rice loaded half a month ago had not yet arrived at the port, so the rice stocks on the market were monopolized and manipulated by speculators. Rumors were rampant, and people were confused. New speculators did not care about the price and rushed to buy, so the morning price rose by one yuan, and the mid-market price rose by an additional two yuan, about three yuan higher than the previous day, but the actual transaction volume did not exceed 4,000 bags.

In addition to the previously agreed 2,900 tons of foreign rice, yesterday rice merchants and firms added another 1,000 tons to be loaded, so it can arrive in Shanghai at the beginning of next month. It will still be sold by Dafoo Foreign Firm at a price of 33.5 yuan. There are still two or three batches that are being negotiated, and it is difficult to predict whether they will be completed.

### Flour Following Step by Step

The flour market price remains at the original price, but because the rice price has been rising step by step for several days, people's minds inevitably have a positive outlook. In addition, it is rumored that various factories have reduced the number of trucks, which has aroused the favor of scattered speculators. However, as it is the weekend, actual sales are still limited. As a result, the transaction volume is about 40,000 bags. The base price of No. 2 flour is 7.2 yuan, and the customer price and artillery car flour are several cents to a dime higher. The recovery of the goods from the warehouse has also increased by several cents to a dime. It is also heard that the price of Japanese Phoenix brand flour has also increased, from 6.95 yuan in October to 7.15 yuan in November. On the 19th, 500 bags of flour were shipped to Xiamen.

The source of wheat is still scarce. Recently, the sales market has been flat for a long time, but the suppliers have become more determined to sell due to high costs and high grain prices. The Tong market traded 5,000 bags of wheat from the Fufan and Liang factories to Changxi and Zhenjiang. Speculators opened four or five trucks, resulting in a market that was slightly stronger than before by three to five cents.

### Oil Market Raw Soybean Oil A Short Rest

—But the Increase Has Been Quite Significant—

Yesterday, the market prices of soybean oil and peanut oil both turned stable. This is because soybean oil has risen sharply by eight or nine yuan in seven days, and raw oil has risen sharply by three to four yuan, causing actual sales to decline. However, those who are making a fortune from the national crisis have not yet been satisfied, so there is still an undertow of slow progress in its potential. Yesterday, the Tong market traded 500 cans of Jiangbei raw oil and 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, all sold at the original price of the previous day. In addition to Qingdao oil rising slightly by 30 cents, with a price of 75.3 yuan, 40 barrels were traded. In addition, 100 pieces of Yanqi oil were traded at 58 yuan.

2820 bags of North Shalaizi soybeans and 530 bags from Qiya came.

Today, 1640 bags of soybeans and 540 bags of raw kernels were shipped to Hong Kong, and 330 bags of soybeans and 110 bags of sorghum were shipped to Xiamen.

### Finance Hong Kong Bankers Buying Gold The Local Market May Be Able to Slightly Reverse the Decline

Yesterday's spot bare gold gray market situation, although in the midst of human fatigue, did not fall. The result was no glory or disgrace compared to the day before yesterday. Among them, the ones who were selling more vigorously were the securities firms, and the reason why the market situation was pulled back was due to the one-time search and entry by Hong Kong bankers, which was sufficient to offset it. The opening price was the same as the previous day, originally 3630 yuan, and then the first buyer was a bullish money exchange business that had sold out the day before, so it rose to a high of 3645 yuan. However, the securities firms came to sell and stuff it, fortunately supported by the pawnshop bankers, and began to hover between 3630 and 3640 yuan. As a result, after 11 o'clock, there was a sudden report that the exchange rate was suddenly loose and hard. At that time, the buyers were unable to continue and stood by and watched, while the securities firms took the opportunity to open a selling boom, coupled with the frequent and continuous release of a certain bank and gold shop, and once fell to a low of 3615 yuan. Around noon, the large buyer Hong Kong bankers vigorously absorbed it, because the gold price in Hong Kong was reported to be good, and entered about 300 taels of light, and the foreign exchange stopped loosening and was slightly stable, and finally reported back to 3633 yuan. Soon after, it was closed at 3630 yuan, but according to the settlement of the US exchange rate, it actually fell by as much as 427 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the Saturday relationship, there was no market in the field, and there were few people outside the field, and transactions were not easy. Because a certain securities firm also absorbed on behalf of the Hong Kong bankers, it was heard that it had been made as high as 3650 yuan, and then slightly returned to flat. Finally, someone sold at 3645 yuan. The transaction was smooth in the morning, with more than 1,000 taels. The pawnshop's jewelry gold did not move all day, and the customs gold and other gold were still flat.

Bare Gold Did Not Distinguish Between High and Low

From the morning, each strip (ten taels), the initial opening was stable. First, the pawnshop bankers entered 20 taels from the money exchange industry, still at 3630 yuan. Shortly after, a certain money exchange business was excited to buy, and vigorously entered more than 300 taels. Although a certain bank and retail investors took the opportunity to sell, the head position still felt narrow. Soon after, it rose by 15 yuan, and the money exchange industry did 30 taels with each other, for 3645 yuan. At that time, the securities firms suddenly started a selling boom, and the buyers had enough appetite, so the price could not be sustained and fell back. In a short while, it fell by 12 yuan, and the securities firms sold 20 taels to the gold shop, for 3633 yuan. Later, the pawnshop bankers collected on behalf of customers, raising it by 10 yuan, and the pawnshop bankers entered 40 taels from the securities firms, for 3643 yuan. Although the gold shop and the money exchange industry came to compete for sale, the buyers still had a good appetite, so the price once wandered between 3630 and 3640 yuan. It was not until about 11 o'clock that the exchange rate suddenly reported a loose trend, and the entrants suddenly became less, coupled with the increasingly strong selling intention of the securities firms, etc., and fell to 3615 yuan. Near noon, the Hong Kong bankers suddenly came and absorbed about 300 taels, and the foreign exchange also stopped loosening and turned flat, and the trend suddenly turned flat. In an instant, it rose by 18 yuan, and the pawnshop bankers entered 50 taels from the money exchange industry, for 3633 yuan. After falling back by 3 yuan, the money exchange industry spit out 30 taels to a certain pawnshop, for 3630 yuan, as the closing price at noon. In the afternoon, Saturday was a holiday, and the result was no difference from the previous day, only 30 yuan up and down for half a day. The selling price of the current number's own brand gold is 10 yuan higher than that of bare gold, and the purchase price is reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current marked gold is about 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there are few transactions.

Jewelry Gold Still Suspended at the Original Price

The exchange price of pawnshop jewelry gold per tael has not changed all day. Datonghang is still suspended at 370 yuan, the same as the upper price of Xintonghang. The purchase price is reduced by 15 to 20 yuan.

### Quiet Currency Exchange Market: Slight Loosening After US and Hong Kong Banks' Initial Hesitation

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no fluctuations in HSBC's listed rates. The unofficial GBP/USD market remained ordinary due to the shortened Saturday trading hours. Trading was sparse, but the underlying trend still indicated a firm tone. Major operators had shown no significant activity in the past few days, leaving future changes to be seen in the coming Monday. The morning began with a continued shrinking of USD against GBP by three points, leading to a repeat of the initial tight USD and stable GBP situation. GBP was at 5/28125, and USD at 8.5625. The market then became quiet. Although a Chinese bank tried to buy USD for delivery this month, it had no impact. Around 11 AM, Hong Kong banks suddenly offered to sell, coupled with the emergence of US banks' willingness to sell, also acting on behalf of exporters. This caused the situation to slightly harden, reaching 5/34375 and 8.6875. HSBC, seeing the low prices, was eager to buy in, causing a slight softening to 5/3125 and 8.625. By the close, the rates were still at 5/34375 and 8.65625, each loosening by 0.0625 compared to the previous day. The trend in futures was similar to that of spot rates.

After the opening, the market was dull with little trading. After HSBC's listed rates were announced and unchanged, the silver balancing tax was announced at mostly half. Subsequently, Chinese banks and Xingye came to buy USD for delivery this month at 8.5625. The situation remained very calm, with little price fluctuation. Around 11 AM, Hong Kong suddenly offered to sell, and at the same time, US banks such as Chase also sold. As a result, the situation gradually hardened. Hong Kong telegraphic transfers (T/T) were sold to foreign banks such as HSBC at 5/3125 and 34375 for spot GBP. Then, Chase also sold spot USD at 8.625 and 65625 to foreign banks such as Youli. The USD was once quoted at 8.6875. Sellers then stopped selling, and the rate softened back to 5/3125 and 8.625. By the noon close, the banks' spot selling prices were 5/34375 for GBP and 8.65625 for USD, and 5/28125 for December/January GBP and 8.53125 for USD.

Yesterday's stock market for various companies opened slightly quiet, then gradually became active. Trading was relatively lively in the half-day, but the range of price fluctuations seemed narrow, and the trend was difficult to grasp. Only Shanghai Silver Company shares, Jardine Matheson shares, and Steel Industry shares rarely looked back after recording high opening prices. Rubber shares were also firm. Most of the trading was limited to Kroewoekoe and Langkat shares, with nothing else worth mentioning.

### Yarn and Cotton: Difficult Transportation on All Sides, Yarn Sales Increasingly Sluggish

Shanghai Yarn Factories Have Huge Profits

The yarn market remains scattered and weak, with a depressed situation. This is due to weak actual demand and difficult transportation on all sides, resulting in softened sentiment. Most operators are suffering heavy losses, but are unwilling to sacrifice and settle. Therefore, although the trend is not good, everyone is standing idly by without taking action, resulting in increasingly sluggish transactions and narrow fluctuations. Judging from the general trend, the future needs actual sales to support it, and the market is unlikely to see a new situation.

The opening of the current yarn market was extremely bleak, with scattered participants and chaotic sentiment. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 632 yuan, with only 10 bales traded. Soon, there were many sellers, but even fewer buyers, creating a scene of complete idleness. The price then dropped another step to 628 yuan, with little excitement in the middle. The closing price recovered by two yuan to 630 yuan. It was found that the transaction volume for the half-day was only 525 bales, compared to 165 bales traded in the afternoon of the previous day. 20-count Double Horse fell by 3.5 yuan, Tiannv fell by 3 yuan, and Double Earth fell by 3 yuan. Only 10-count coarse yarn was flat. Today, 55 pieces of exported cotton yarn were shipped to Siam, 125 pieces to Hong Kong, and 160 pieces to Xiamen. The amounts bought by each group are listed on the left:

Same Trade: 32 lines: Hong Kong: 155
Inland: 25: Ningbo: 20
Previous Day's Transactions: 165
Two-Day Transaction Statistics: 690

Tonglai Yarn Factory is making exceptionally high profits, especially the Japanese factories. For example, the Shanghai Yarn Factory Co., Ltd., a Japanese-owned company in this city, resolved at yesterday's board meeting to pay a dividend of 5 yuan per share for the six months ending at the end of October of this year. It is reported that the factory's surplus for this period reached more than 4.6 million yuan.

### Chinese Factories Continue to Purchase American Cotton

Domestic Cotton Only Appealing to Fellow Traders

Transactions in domestic cotton are limited to those appealing to fellow traders, but are not smooth. There are only slight purchases to embellish the market, so the market remains calm. This is because yarn prices are not rising, and manufacturers have no intention of replenishing raw materials, and are temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude. Japanese merchants are also taking the same approach. The supply from northern Jiangsu continues unabated, arriving with 4,090 bales, Changyinsha with more than 900 bales, and cotton from Beisha with 1,840 bales. The current situation of cotton is recorded below:

Tonghua: 134.00 | 136.00 | 135.00 | 146.25 | Traders Buying In: 492 Bales
Huoji: 129.00 | 129.50 | 128.50 | Also | 300 Bales
Xiasahua: 136.50 | Also | 100 Bales
Pingguoer: 118.00 | Also | 100 Pieces

Another report: The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet in recent days. Factories are still reluctant to buy in because yarn prices are not rising. However, each factory has very little inventory of long-fiber raw cotton. Traders, in view of this, have successively ordered thousands of bales. Yesterday, Shenxin also intended to purchase long-fiber raw cotton, so it ordered more than 1,000 pieces of this American cotton, all of which are ready to be shipped, and the price delivered to the factory is about 190 yuan. Xinyu also purchased several hundred pieces of American cotton for spinning 24-count yarn. Other factories have not been heard to have placed orders.

Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was very active yesterday morning. Overseas cotton merchants were buying strongly in the market, causing cotton prices to rise by 5 to 6 pound sounds. Later, because there were fewer buyers, most bulls took profits, and banks sold out, turning softer. As a result, at the close, prices fell by 3 to 4 pound sounds compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market rose one rupee including forecasts yesterday. The Egyptian cotton market rose 40 to 100 pound sounds. Liverpool rose 10 pence.

### Piece Goods: Eastern Cloth Forced Short Covering Leads to Price Increase, National Cloth Market Turns Stable

Following the previous market's sluggish momentum, the morning opening for cotton cloth remained soft. Retailers were eager to sell their holdings, further reducing prices by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan per piece. Then, due to forced short covering in Eastern cloth, prices rebounded, and the market also turned firm. Selling was flat, and transactions were more lively at local dyeing factories and wholesale houses. Transactions included 5,000 to 6,000 pieces of grey fabrics such as fine cloth and fine twill, 200 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, printed cloth, flannel, and coarse cloth. In northern Jiangsu and Jingwu areas, 4,000 to 5,000 pieces of goods such as blue cloth and colored twill were traded. The Nanyang gang purchased approximately 1,000 pieces of coarse cloth, bleached cloth, and colored cloth.

Due to active local sales, the market sentiment for Eastern cloth, white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill turned firm. The current quoted selling price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 17.65 yuan per piece, and fine twill at 16.75 yuan, each raised by 0.15 yuan per piece. Four Gentlemen broadcloth also recovered to 0.57 to 0.5725 yuan per yard. In the morning market, Nisshin Yoko opened 200 parcels of Longtou Blue Double Fish and Suzhou Color Ball fine cloth. The quoted price for Longtou Blue Double Fish spot was 16.35 yuan per piece, and Suzhou Color Ball was only 16.4 yuan per piece. In summary, local customers purchased more than 800 pieces of white goods.

Exports: 100 pieces shipped to Xiamen on the 19th, 160 pieces to Hong Kong, 50 pieces to Tule, and 5 pieces to Siam.

### Coal: Coal Balls Sold at Low Prices

Recently, due to competition among various factories, coal ball prices have been secretly lowered, with low prices emerging. Yitaixing and Guohua Coal Balls reduced prices by 2 yuan yesterday. The price for self-pickup by traders is 57 yuan per ton, and delivered is 58 yuan. As a result, various small factories also followed suit, dare not hold on. Reducing the burden on people's livelihood is currently a pressing need. However, the retail prices in local stores vary, ranging from 3.1 to 3.12 yuan per 100 catties.

### Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Transactions Turn Active

Although the trend for domestic sugar is soft, transactions between firms are gradually becoming active. Yesterday, Huanggang Qing opened at 35 yuan, Ban Nan Qing at 33 yuan, Fan Chi at 35 yuan, and second-grade at 32 yuan, with a total of more than 300 bags traded. The market for foreign sugar set by the guild was flat, with slight fluctuations. Local godown number 24 coarse was 51 yuan, new arrivals from foreign godowns were slightly higher at 52 yuan, and old goods were 51.5 yuan, the same as the previous day. Repackaged goods remained at 41.5 yuan. Taikoo Car White B Mark and others were unchanged. H Mark Car Chi was slightly lower at 40 yuan. Local cotton white was slightly higher at 0.5 yuan, number one was 51 yuan, and the rest remained the same. Local number one ice rose by 0.5 yuan to 62.5 yuan, number two was 62 yuan, and Jingming ice was 64 yuan.

### Western Reporters Return to Shanghai After Inspection: Discussing the Cause and Effect of the Great Victory in Northern Hunan, Chinese Army Highly Disciplined and Brave in Combat, County Magistrate Personally Leads Guerrillas to Intercept

In early October, the Chinese army achieved a great victory in the northern Hunan area. Western reporters, under the invitation of the Central Propaganda Department, organized an inspection tour to the former front. According to a Western reporter who recently returned to Shanghai from Chongqing, the Chinese army's victory was several times greater than the Taierzhuang battle. The combat area stretched from northern Hunan to Wuning in northern Jiangxi, covering an area of no less than 250 square miles. The fighting lasted for 10 days. Although the Japanese army spent a month prior

Long-term preparation

the number of combatants was also more than the Chinese army. However, the Chinese army was able to use extremely clever tactics to defeat them all. The Japanese army not only failed to advance a single step, but in several places retreated several miles further than before. Between October 2 and 5, the Japanese army was cut into several sections by the Chinese army. When the Japanese commander Okamura decided to

Order a retreat

he had no way to convey his order. In desperation, he used an airplane to convey it, but the plane crashed in the mountains near Tongcheng, and failed to complete its mission. In fact, the Japanese troops on each front had been automatically retreating in a disheveled manner since October 2. In addition to clever tactics, there are three reasons for the Chinese army's victory this time: (1) The soldiers gave their lives. When the Japanese army first attacked,

Their momentum was quite strong

Later, two Chinese county magistrates personally led 5,000 guerrillas to intercept their rear troops fiercely, making it impossible for the front and rear to take care of each other, and their momentum was thwarted. (2) Thorough arrangement. In advance, the Chinese army had destroyed all the highways south of the Xinqiang River, so that the Japanese army's mechanical units could not move after arriving in the area, greatly reducing their combat power. Moreover, due to transportation difficulties, the soldiers

Insufficient supplies

They felt even more distressed. (3) Strict military discipline. All the Chinese troops fighting in the province were highly disciplined and brave in combat. Even if they were injured in several places, they still fought hard and did not retreat. They also maintained close contact with the people, and even automatically helped the farmers with farming. The farmers also automatically helped to carry the wounded and served as guides. In summary, the Chinese troops on the front lines are not only morale-boosting and have sufficient military equipment, but also have far richer combat experience than the Japanese army. The future is very promising.

### Concession Authorities Implement Winter Defense

Locking Down Alleys

The Shanghai Municipal Council Police Force is actively preparing for winter defense as the winter season approaches. In order to prevent bandits from acting rashly and rioters from causing trouble, in addition to locking down each alley connecting to the border-crossing areas of western Shanghai since the day before yesterday, the Engineering Office has also been requested since today to dispatch many workers to erect wooden posts and wrap them with barbed wire to completely block the alleys north of Avenue Edward VII, including Race Course Road, Route Massenet, Route Chongqing, Weihaiwei Road, Route Doumer, and Chengdu Road. Only one entrance and exit will be left in each alley. It is reported that the areas around Xin Zha Road, Macgregor Road, and Carter Road are also planned to be locked down within a few days.

In October of this year, imports were 764,000 yuan, and exports were 34,000 yuan. However, trade between the United Kingdom and France and Shanghai has also been significantly affected, as the number of British, French, and German merchant ships traveling on the Far East line has decreased due to the war.

### Puppet Police Shoot at British Car, British Consulate Has Filed a Protest, Based on a Detailed Report from the Police Force, the British Consulate Protests to the Puppet Regime

According to the Shanghai Times, a British Consul in Shanghai told a reporter last night (17th) that the British Consul General had lodged a protest with "Shanghai Mayor" Chuan Xiaoyan regarding the shooting incident on Dufeng Road at 10 p.m. on Wednesday. The protest was filed because a "City Government" police officer had no obvious reason

Or warning

He opened fire on a British resident driving a car. The Public Concession Police Force submitted a detailed report on the matter to the British Consulate yesterday afternoon. After studying it, the British authorities protested to the "City Government." The process of the shooting incident is as follows: A British resident was driving a car north to south on Dufeng Road. At the intersection of Daxi Road, he saw a "City Government" policeman standing on the side of the road. But the policeman did not give a hand signal to stop the car, so the British resident

Continued to drive

But before the car reached the end of the road, a rifle shot was heard. A bullet whizzed past the car. The British resident was not injured and accelerated into McGee Road. After receiving the report, the British military authorities requested the "City Government Police Department" to explain, but yesterday

There was no reply

The British Consul General lodged a protest yesterday. The British military authorities have confirmed the number of the policeman who fired the shot. The British resident who was shot at kept his name confidential and did not disclose it.

### Successive Transactions of Tribute Rice; Large Quantities of National Rice to be Shipped to Shanghai for Storage Within Days; Market Prices Fluctuate and Have Not Yet Moved onto the Right Track

Various rice trading firms in this city, seeing that the Saigon authorities have already lifted the ban and permitted the export of rice, have jointly commissioned the French firm D'Affoux to telegraph Saigon rice merchants to order large quantities of tribute rice to be shipped to Shanghai for market regulation. In addition to the 500 tons already transacted and loaded onto ships yesterday, another 1,900 tons, totaling 19,000 bags, have also been negotiated and are expected to arrive in early next month. This tribute rice was purchased by rice shops such as Shuntai, Houde, Tairun, and Shunfeng in this city, and the selling price is 30.60 yuan per 198 catties.

Rice Industry Encourages the Transportation of National Rice

According to news from various firms in the rice market, there is no fear of shortage. Currently, in national rice-producing areas, except for Wuhu, which has been entirely purchased by Japanese merchants, other places such as Changshu, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou are all permitted to transport rice to Shanghai for market regulation. However, due to transportation delays and difficulties, it is reported that large quantities of national rice will be shipped to Shanghai for storage within days. Currently, rice industry groups are rewarding merchants who transport national rice, and once the goods arrive, their selling prices will be assessed separately and sold on the market. Moreover, rice-producing areas are full of stock, and it is expected that within half a month, the rice stock in the Shanghai market will gradually increase. As for merchants and residents who are storing up for emergencies, there are already quite a few.

Prices Rise and Fall Without Basis

Yesterday afternoon, rice prices rose again. According to people in the rice industry, recently small households have been crowding to hoard, and some with strong financial resources are buying recklessly. After the price of indica rice rose, the price of japonica rice also rose, and had no choice but to follow suit. In reality, Shanghai is full of white japonica rice, so the recent rice prices in Shanghai have not moved onto the right track.

Body of Japanese Rice Merchant Found

A Japanese named Sato Kinji came to Shanghai in March this year and took advantage of the special environment to open a Sato Automobile Company on Dongbaoxing Road in Zhabei, and also set up a rice shop nearby to make profits. Although it has only been a few months, the profits are quite substantial. Every month, he must go to the villages in the Hongqiao area of ​​western Shanghai three times to buy rice. At about 11:00 AM on the 15th of this month, the Japanese once again led three empty trucks to Hongqiao to collect rice. Unexpectedly, when passing near Tangjiaxing on Hongqiao Road, he suddenly encountered four strong men holding box cannons, who ordered him to stop and dragged the Japanese down and kidnapped him. Although the Japanese army sent teams to search afterwards, there was no whereabouts. It was not until the afternoon of the 16th that someone discovered his body floating in a small river outside the town, and the Japanese side retrieved it to the shore for burial.

### Anglo-American-Japanese Conference Just a Rumor

Even Suma is Unaware

The Continental Daily reported that the Japanese side yesterday (the 17th) rumored that Sir Kerr, Johnson, and Kato would soon hold a triangular meeting in Shanghai, but this has not been confirmed by the American and British sides. According to Japanese sources, the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and Japan in China are about to meet to review Tokyo's relations with Washington and London in relation to China. The news pointed out that the return of the British ambassador to Shanghai was not just a coincidence, and the American ambassador has also left Chongqing and is now in Hong Kong, on his way to Shanghai. At the same time, it is recalled that the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma said when hosting foreign journalists at the Broadway Mansion on Thursday evening that he was completely unaware that such negotiations would take place in Shanghai. However, according to Japanese sources, the British government has notified all countries, including Japan, of its intention to withdraw British troops from North China, but has not notified Chongqing. Although Chongqing is well aware of Britain's decision, the fact that it has not received notification is quite noteworthy.

### Overseas Chinese in Europe Return Home One After Another; First Batch of Dutch Overseas Chinese Arrives in Shanghai; Difficulties in Business After the War Lead to Many Job Losses

Since the outbreak of the European war, the situation in Germany and Belgium has become increasingly tense, and the Dutch government has also actively prepared for war, causing great damage to the business of overseas Chinese in the Netherlands. Due to the daily pressure of livelihood, they have prepared to come to China one after another. The first batch of 41 Dutch overseas Chinese, including Hu Yimin and Pan Mingxian, arrived in Shanghai on the 14th on the Comte de Fours, the same ship as the French overseas Chinese. They are all originally from Wenzhou, Qingti, Rui'an and other places in Zhejiang, and have lived in the Netherlands for a long time, engaged in small businesses selling carpets and foreign goods. After arriving in Shanghai, due to unfamiliarity with the place, they were received by the Wenzhou Shanghai Association and lodged in hotels, planning to wait for a ship to Ningbo and then go to Wenzhou.

Large Numbers of Overseas Chinese Prepare to Return Home

According to Mr. Lin Juexin of the Wenzhou Association in Shanghai, who received the returning overseas Chinese, there are about 2,000 overseas Chinese from Zhejiang living in the Netherlands. Before the Sino-Japanese War, most of them were engaged in selling Japanese goods. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, overseas Chinese in China have boycotted Japanese goods, and at the same time, various countries have also banned the import of Japanese goods. Overseas Chinese in the Netherlands have also changed to selling other foreign goods or directly purchasing domestic goods from China and transporting them to the Netherlands for sale. Although the cost is huge and the profit is minimal, they are willing to save money and work hard. Since the outbreak of the European War, the sources of various goods have been scarce, and the purchasing power of foreigners has been weak, causing business to plummet. At present, it is unprofitable for overseas Chinese in the Netherlands, so most of them are preparing to return home. Those who came to Shanghai this time are not many, and there are still a large number of overseas Chinese who are applying to the consulate for passports, preparing to wait for a ship to return home.

Overseas Chinese in France Describe the Situation in Detail

A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with Mr. Ye Tinghuan, an overseas Chinese who returned from France, yesterday. According to him, since the outbreak of the European war in France, all men of age in the country have been conscripted for military service, so individual overseas Chinese engaged in industry and commerce in France have been invited to work in French factories. In the past, those who worked in French factories received about 7 to 12 francs per hour. After the war, factories reduced their expenses and lowered wages. Recently, in addition to providing food and lodging, each person is only given 5 francs per day, which is very different from before the war. Therefore, the livelihood of overseas Chinese working in factories has become unsustainable. As for overseas Chinese engaged in commerce, due to the scarcity of various goods and the sharp decline in sales, they have become stagnant. There are many overseas Chinese in France, and many have lost their jobs due to the impact of the European war. If the European situation continues to deteriorate, the livelihood prospects of overseas Chinese will be in an unimaginable situation. Most overseas Chinese are preparing to return home, but travel is inconvenient and costly during the war. It is hoped that the consulates can find ways to provide relief so that overseas Chinese can return home conveniently.

### Permanently Commemorate Ma Xiangbo; Raise Scholarship Funds

The Shanghai Preparatory Committee for the Memorial Service for Ma Xiangbo received a suggestion from Mr. Ying Yongyu yesterday: Respected Sirs, Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a member of the National Government and an elder statesman, passed away on the 4th of this month. Upon receiving the telegram in Shanghai, all circles were deeply saddened and established a preparatory committee to carry out the memorial service. Considering that Mr. Ma dedicated his life to education and founded schools, in order to permanently commemorate Mr. Ma and to cultivate talents for the country, Ying Yongyu hereby suggests that your committee raise 100,000 yuan for the "Mr. Ma Xiangbo Memorial Scholarship." In addition to immediately telegraphed the National Government to allocate funds, a telegram should be sent to all circles across the country to jointly conduct fundraising activities to form a committee responsible for managing the funds and hosting annual public examinations in the future, so that outstanding young people from poor families across the country have the opportunity to study, to seek happiness for the people. Please proceed quickly, which is truly convenient for the public. Mr. Ying Yongyu also suggested to Fudan and Aurora universities to add free academic spots in the name of Ma Xiangbo.

### Mitsui Not Satisfied with Seizing Eggs, Entrapping People in Injustice; Asking a British Company to Pick Up Eggs of an American Company; The Goal is to Create Disputes Between Britain and the United States

The English "China Press" reported that the Mitsui Company has repeatedly decided to forcibly seize the eggs of foreign companies in Shanghai, and now it is employing a trick to deceive. Recently, an American company in this city purchased a batch of eggs, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The Mitsui Company forcibly seized them and allocated a portion, notifying a British company to pick them up. It turns out that the Mitsui Company had seized hundreds of baskets of eggs from the British company in recent weeks, and intended to compensate them with these eggs of the American company. When the British company inspected the eggs, they found that the labels of the shipper entrusted by Wang Shuming had been torn off. Then they learned that this batch of eggs was actually purchased by an American company on the Yangtze River estuary. If they accept these eggs, they will be accused by the original American company of receiving stolen goods. If the original owner takes back this batch of eggs, the British company will have no hope of recovering the seized eggs. However, the American and British companies have now contacted each other to discuss this matter, so the Mitsui Company's plan to cause disputes between the two companies and escape responsibility itself may not succeed.

### Dredging Project, All Previous Efforts Wasted

The silted beach and Yuji Mound on the river, after suspension, water conservancy is hindered

The dredging bureau's dredgers, including Jianshe, Hailong, Haihu, Haibao, Haima, Haili, Haita, and the surveying ship Lilang, a total of more than ten large and small vessels, have been detained by the Japanese side. The whereabouts of each ship, except for Jianshe, which is currently docked in the Yangshupu River, are largely unknown. The cost of building the above dredgers came from the dredger donation levied by the Jianghai Customs on Chinese and foreign ships entering and leaving the port of Shanghai, so the bureau is of an international nature. Therefore, the Customs Commissioner of Customs, Mr. Merger and others repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side, and the consular corps was also very concerned, but it was ultimately abandoned due to the harsh conditions put forward by the Japanese side. The dredging projects that have been suspended as a result include the silted beach project outside the Wusong Estuary, the Wusong River project from Fanhuangdu to Yuji Mound, and various sections of the Huangpu River project. Among them, the silted beach dredging was designed by the former chief engineer of the bureau, Mr. Chatley. The initial dredging was scheduled for five years. Once completed, any large ship could enter and exit the Huangpu River. Now all previous efforts have been wasted.

### Ninth Installment of Principal and Interest on the Yuping Public Bond to be Paid at the End of the Month

The Paying Agencies are the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications

### Canadian Priest Dies Tragically; British Consulate Considers it Closed; Actually Thanking the Japanese Commander for His Care

The North-China Daily News reported that the Japanese Army spokesman claimed to reporters yesterday (the 17th) that the British Consul in Nanjing, Alexander, visited the Japanese commander in Xuzhou on Thursday to thank the Japanese for their treatment of a Canadian priest who died at the hands of Japanese soldiers. The British also agreed with the Japanese that the matter was closed. The talks were informal. The Japanese commander expressed regret over the death of the priest.

### Three US Agencies in Shanghai to Implement Joint Office; Increase Efficiency According to the President's Plan; Will Become a Well-Coordinated Unit Thereafter

The English "China Press" reported that the US Consul General Gauss has recently explained to local reporters the establishment of a separate foreign affairs department proposed by US President Roosevelt and approved by the US Congress, saying that under the new plan, the US Department of Commerce and the Foreign Agricultural Department of the Department of Agriculture will be incorporated into the Foreign Affairs Department of the State Department in order to improve work efficiency. Therefore, before November 1, the three US offices in Shanghai, namely the US Commercial Counselor's Office, the US Agricultural Commissioner's Office, and the US Consulate General, which are located in the central district of this city, will move to the Construction Building together, occupying the 4th, 5th, and 6th floors respectively. This will become "a single and well-coordinated unit" to eliminate duplicate work under the general management of the Consul General and the Counselor of the Embassy, ​​and under the direct supervision and command of the US Commercial Counselor Anlider. Mr. Tuosen, the Agricultural Commissioner who is on vacation in the United States, is scheduled to leave the United States today (the 18th) by ship to return to Shanghai and continue to handle agricultural affairs.

### Telephone Lines in Western Shanghai and Hongkou are Often Cut and Stolen

Due to the surge in the population of the concession, the business of the Shanghai Telephone Company is developing rapidly. The original overhead and underground cables, as well as switchboards, etc., are insufficient for distribution, so some users often resell their licenses, which has a great impact on the business. In addition to announcing a ban, the company is also expanding its lines to meet the needs of the citizens. However, in remote areas of western Shanghai and Hongkou, thieves often cut and steal overhead wires and rubber-covered wires on the outside walls, as well as various other parts, which often obstructs telephone calls. A reward was offered for the arrest of these thieves, but in the end, due to their secretive actions, the case could not be solved. Therefore, the company specifically asked the Public Concession Police Department to issue a notice yesterday. If someone reports a case that is concluded by the court and convicted, the reward will be 100 yuan. When reporting the information, you can directly report to the police stations.

### China Farmers Bank Promotes Agricultural Products

Submitted to Chairman Chiang for Approval; Has Instructed Branches in Various Places to Comply

In order to develop domestic agriculture, the China Farmers Bank has formulated the principles of agricultural promotion loans and submitted them to Chairman Chiang for approval. The principles of the loan are distributed to the farmers' branches in various places to follow.

### Released by the French Government of Vietnam; Metals and Hardware Shipped to Shanghai; Paper Supply Not to be Cut Off and Prices Rise; Value of Metals and Hardware Will Also Fall

In recent years, our country has been actively promoted the papermaking industry by the Ministry of Industry, which has a vigorous atmosphere, because it has a great relationship with culture, and it should not be completely dependent on others. Among them, the largest scale is the Wenxi Paper Mill, which has been preparing for several years before it was completed, and was ultimately suspended due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance. There was once a proposal to move to Kunming, but the outbreak of the European War, although the efficiency between China and Europe was not interrupted because of this, the transportation was difficult, and the detention and delay along the way were particularly complicated, resulting in no definite date for the arrival of the goods. The price of goods has risen strangely as a result. The large quantities of paper that merchants in Shanghai had ordered from European countries before the European war initially arrived in Shanghai, but were later detained in Haiphong, so the price of newspapers in Shanghai gradually increased. It is now heard that a large number of papers, metal materials, and various foreign goods, etc., that were blocked in Haiphong have been allowed to be released by the French government of Vietnam after the efforts of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Haiphong. They will be loaded and shipped to Shanghai within days. As for the foreign goods, they are still under negotiation, so there will be no shortage of paper in Shanghai, and prices will also fall.

### Recruiting Fake Officials to Defraud Money

The Main Culprit is at Large; A Woman is Arrested

A Ningbo native surnamed Wei, who lives at No. 2, Gengyu Lane, Pope Road, in the French Concession, often said to his brother-in-law, Tang Jianxiong, that he was working in the Jianghai Customs of the fake organization. Because the Customs has recently added six sub-stations in other places to collect taxes, it is urgent to recruit personnel, with a monthly salary of 88 yuan, but each person must pay 300 yuan for activity expenses. Taking his sister-in-law's home as a liaison office, unemployed people, eager to find a job, went to contact the Tang siblings and paid the activity fees to the Tang siblings, waiting for a job without end. This matter was detected by Detective Zhang Xiaofa of the French Police Department, and he went to arrest Tang Jianxiong, who had already fled upon hearing the news. He then arrested his sister, Wei's wife, for investigation. It was found that Lou Zhengmin, Gao Gucheng, Yang Zhishan, and Wu Zhenhua had been deceived and paid 300 yuan for activity expenses. There were also more than ten people who had not been identified. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court. Police lawyer Gu Shouxu explained the case and requested a reform of the investigation, supplementing the arrest of the main culprit who was at large for further interrogation. After Judge Zhu Chuzhe interrogated the defendant Wei's wife, he ruled that the date would be changed to one month later, December 21, for further interrogation, because she was pregnant and due to give birth, and it was inconvenient to detain her. He also allowed the defendant to be released on bail by her defense lawyer.

### Industrialists Organize the Sino-American Chemical Industrial Plant

Realizing the lack of domestic chemical raw materials and the scarcity and high prices of imported goods, Shanghai industrialists have jointly initiated the organization of the Sino-American Chemical Industrial Manufacturing Plant with well-known overseas Chinese businessmen. The plant specializes in the production of various chemical raw materials, such as hydrochloric acid and caustic soda, in order to promote industry and recover losses. The plant has strong capital and a large scale, and has specially hired experienced technicians and industrial experts to plan everything. The plant site is located in western Shanghai, and the construction of the plant is about to be completed. It is expected that it can officially ship goods in mid-December.

### Reasons for the Decrease in Small Denomination Banknotes

The number of one-jiao, two-jiao, and five-jiao subsidiary coins newly issued by the Bank of China circulating in the market today is indeed less than before. In fact, every year when autumn deepens and winter begins, businesses and banks must carry funds to the inland to purchase local products. The goods collected from the villagers are mostly collected in small batches, and the prices and numbers all have jiao and fen in the end. In order to make the collection of goods convenient, it is necessary to search and collect in Shanghai in advance. However, once it reaches mid-December, the villagers will turn to Shanghai to purchase goods in batches, and the small denomination banknotes that flow out will return to Shanghai in due course, so there is no fear of a lack of funds.

### Stealing Grandfather's Savings Passbook, Inciting the Crime and Sentencing to Imprisonment, Three Siblings Not Accepted

Zhao Wenxuan, a 71-year-old man from Hangzhou who started out as a factory worker, was playing a board game with his concubine downstairs in his house at No. 62, Seymour Road, at 1:30 PM on the 8th of this month, when his grandson Fengzhang, Jinkun, and granddaughter Xunmei colluded to sneak into his bedroom upstairs and steal two bank passbooks, six seals, and 180 yuan in legal tender from a leather bag. They handed them over to their cousin, Shao Jiajun (a sophomore at Great China University), who instigated the crime. Shao Jiajun withdrew 3,500 yuan in legal tender from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank on Beijing Road and the Bank of China on Tongfu Road with the two passbooks and seals, and temporarily deposited 1,700 yuan in the Pudong Bank on Aiduya Road. Afterwards, Shao Jiajun went to the home of his classmate, Zhao Bingying, a local from No. 5, Luban Road in the French Concession, and designed a threatening letter printed with lead characters (signed by the Caojiadu People's Self-Defense Corps, claiming that Zhao was selling enemy goods and had borrowed 3,500 yuan as military pay, which had been withdrawn from the bank, and now the passbooks and seals were returned, etc.), and gave Zhao Bingying 150 yuan. At 6:00 PM on Sunday afternoon, Zhao Bingying hired a car from the No. 8 Auto Company on Baiyubu Road. Zhao Bingying carried a package containing the threatening letter, the two bank passbooks, and the seals, and falsely claimed to be going to the Racecourse Da Guangming to watch a movie. As soon as he arrived at the cinema, he got out of the car and asked the driver, Chen Bugao, to take the package to Zhao Wenxuan's house on Seymour Road. The case was reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which sent detectives to escort Zhao Fengzhang and his two siblings, Shao Jiajun, Zhao Bingying, five men and women in total, to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi came to the Third Criminal Division to investigate and sentenced Shao Jiajun to six months' imprisonment, suspended for three years. For the civil lawsuit part, he was ordered to repay Zhao Wenxuan 940 yuan in national currency. Zhao Fengzhang, Zhao Jinkun, and Zhao Xunmei were not accepted, and their grandfather Zhao Wenxuan was ordered to take them back and discipline them. Zhao Bingying was acquitted and released.

### Written Appeal for Patricide Case: Reasons for Appeal – Key Points for Appeal – Original Trial Based on Single Charge – No Assessment of Psychological Abnormality – Evidence of Zhou Jing's Assistance Insufficient

The sensational and shocking case of parricide, after the initial judgment by Judge Chuan Lin of the First Special Court, sentencing the rebellious sons Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang to death for jointly murdering their direct lineal ascendant, and their mother Zhou Jing to two years and six months imprisonment for assisting in the desecration of the body, has been extensively reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that Zhou Jing and her two sons, Qinji and Qinxiang, have expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict and retained lawyers Yang Linzhi, Ye Shaoying, Yang Sicheng, and Jiang Pingfan to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court. The written appeal, which was submitted to the Second Branch of the High Court yesterday, is excerpted below as a supplement to the reasons for the appeal. Regarding the case against Zhou Qinji et al. for murder and assisting in the desecration of the body, after receiving the initial judgment, an appeal was declared within the statutory period. The supplementary reasons for the appeal are stated below:

Single Charge

(1) Regarding the part of the appeal concerning the appellants Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang jointly murdering their direct lineal ascendant (hereinafter referred to as the appellants), abolishing the death penalty is a recent trend advocated by scholars in criminal policy. Although our country cannot immediately adopt it, reducing the application of absolute death penalty as preparation for abolishing the death penalty can be derived from comparing past penal codes. Article 284 of the old criminal law prescribed the sole death penalty for murder committed with premeditation or by dismembering, cutting, or other cruel methods. This law

removes this provision

and includes life imprisonment as an alternative sentence. The intent of the law is to reduce the provisions for absolute death penalty and fully realize the spirit of the relative principle of legality of crime and punishment. Therefore, caution must be exercised when determining sentencing. In this case, the appellants confessed to the fact of murdering their ascendant, but their act of murder was by no means carried out in a cruel manner. The desecration of the body was solely for the purpose of preventing the discovery of the crime. Even if the methods used involved cruelty, only the part concerning the desecration of the body should be sentenced with the highest degree of punishment. According to the Supreme Court's Non-Character No. 7 Ruling of the 21st year,

the main point of the precedent

is that the result of the murder should be judged from the perspective of a single heavy charge. Since murder is a serious crime, it should be judged and sentenced according to the crime of murder. If the murder was not carried out in a cruel manner, there is no reason to impose the highest degree of punishment for the crime of murder and disregard the sentencing standards stipulated in Article 57 of the Criminal Law. Apart from the single heavy charge, the original trial disregarded other factors (to be elaborated later) and used it as a reason to impose the ultimate penalty, which is unconvincing.

Psychological Abnormality

(2) An act by a person who has lost their mind is not punishable (Article 19, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law). Furthermore, the punishment for an act by a person with diminished mental capacity should be reduced (Paragraph 2 of Article 19 of the same law). According to the provisions of the two paragraphs of this article, both refer to those with mental impairments, but to varying degrees. Those who have not completely lost their mental faculties may have diminished mental capacity or merely dulled mental capacity. This is a fact recognized by modern criminal codes and medical experts in various countries. This law deems the acts of those who have completely lost their mental faculties as acts of the insane and does not punish them. However, it would be contrary to the intent of the law to punish those with less severe

mental dullness the same

as those with sound minds. Therefore, this law does not impose the usual punishment for the acts of those with diminished mental capacity, nor does it completely absolve them of criminal responsibility, but stipulates that the punishment can be reduced. The intent is very clear. Furthermore, foreign criminal codes have many similar provisions, such as the criminal codes of Italy, Japan, Denmark, Sweden, Spain, etc., which list provisions for diminished mental capacity. The International Criminal Law Conference of 1905 also passed a resolution that those with diminished mental capacity who commit crimes should be subject to lighter punishments. The

usual behavior

of the appellants showed no evil habits. The motive for the murder was not to seize property. The reason they ultimately committed such a grave mistake was partly due to their congenital diminished mental capacity and partly due to the failure of education to correct it. Regarding the former, it can be seen from both the paternal and maternal sides of the appellants. Investigating the paternal side reveals that the victim served at the Commercial Press around 1918 and 1919 for more than a year. He had a cold and stern appearance, eccentric behavior, and rarely interacted with colleagues (lawyer Yu Hualong can testify, having worked with him). His daughter, Qin Zhu (i.e., the appellants' sister), also testified to her father's character (the school authorities can testify). During the case, she even

suffered a nervous breakdown, as lawyer Chen Ming of the police force stated on record. Furthermore, according to investigations, the victim's ancestors suffered from severe tuberculosis, which has a medically recognized connection to mental disorders (refer to page 15 of "Criminal Psychology" from the Judicial Administration Department's Judge Training Institute). Investigating the maternal side reveals that her aunt (i.e., Zhou Jing's sister) also had long-standing dementia, which was known to relatives and friends. Based on this, it is not difficult to imagine that many relatives of the victim's family suffered from mental illnesses such as diminished mental capacity. However, this falls within the scope of forensic medicine. Whether the appellants actually had

this condition

should be thoroughly investigated and assessed by specialized medical experts before a conclusion can be reached (refer to Supreme Court Ruling No. 306, Shang Zi, of the 17th year). The original trial completely disregarded this major factor in the crime, succumbing to ethical concepts and social opinion, and hastily pronounced the verdict, failing to fulfill the duties of investigation. Regarding the latter issue of education, the aforementioned mental illnesses can be divided into loss of mind and diminished mental capacity. The former refers to damage to the nervous system, while the latter only refers to

abnormal psychology. There

may not be damage to the nervous system. People with this type of illness are mostly physically weak and mentally exhausted. Their nervous system only has one fixed idea, and it often cannot mutually restrain the rational concepts that form the background of their entire personality. In other words, these people are often isolated from society and only know themselves, not others. Whether their usual will and behavior are compatible with social life is often irrelevant. They only know that those who give birth to them are friends and

those who harm them are enemies. Those with sound physical and mental development can control their daily will and behavior and adapt to social life. Those with unsound physical and mental development are like moths drawn to a flame, often unable to control themselves and becoming slaves to emotional impulses. The only way to correct this type of physical and mental illness is through education. Education can change temperament and correct such patients, sacrificing lesser and more immediate desires to achieve greater and more distant happiness. Whether the appellants have a strong

hereditary connection

to congenital diminished mental capacity remains to be determined. However, observing the appellants' (1) physical weakness, (2) isolated lives, and (3) withdrawn demeanor reveals ample evidence of their mental impairment. Furthermore, the correction of education relies on the complementary efforts of family and school education. Regarding the former, although our country has based its foundations on filial piety for thousands of years, Confucian ethical concepts do not refer to one-sided obligations. This can be seen in Mencius's words: "If the prince regards his ministers as dirt, the ministers will regard the prince as an enemy," and "Kindness is sufficient to protect the four seas, but without extending kindness, one cannot even protect his wife and children." Kindness and filial piety, though different in name, are both

of the same nature. Both

are relative terms. If the father is kind, the son can also be filial. The son's lack of filial piety stems from the father's lack of kindness. Therefore, if the father is unkind, the son may not be filial. "As you sow, so shall you reap." In the family where the appellants lived, they were treated as strangers due to the victim's abuse and coldness. Over time, this destroyed their natural affection. Not only could it not correct the appellants' psychological abnormalities, but it also allowed resentment to continue to grow. The appellants did not hesitate to eliminate the obstacles to their family's happiness by any means possible when they were mentally impaired. Tracing the cause, it was their relentless pursuit of joy, unrestrained by reason. As for

school education,

apart from academics, it often avoids discussing ethical issues, leading to a lack of proper understanding of right and wrong, obedience and defiance. Their naturally cold and withdrawn personalities, combined with the lack of close teachers and friends who could guide and correct them and change their temperament, made their personalities like frozen ice, hidden in an ice cellar, with no chance of melting. This ultimately led to this shocking tragedy. In other words, the appellants' criminal behavior should also be partly attributed to the responsibility of family and school education. Although the appellants' crimes are unforgivable, according to the above explanation, they are truly

victims of a feudal family. Moreover, the motive for the crime was not to seize property, and the purpose of the crime was to save their mother. Therefore, according to the standards for determining the severity of punishment in Article 57 of the Criminal Law, even if the appellants' mental health were determined to be sound, there would be no need to impose the ultimate penalty. Based on the above discussion, the original trial did not assess their mental abnormalities or ask whether their circumstances could be excused, and yet imposed the sole death penalty, which is inappropriate. This is unconvincing.

Issue of Accessory

(3) Regarding the part of the appeal concerning the appellant Zhou Jing assisting in the desecration of the body (hereinafter referred to as the appellant), according to criminal law, an accessory must have knowledge of the principal offender's criminal act and provide assistance. This is already established in Supreme Court Ruling No. 39, Shang Zi, of the 21st year. The appellant in this case had no prior knowledge of her sons desecrating the body, nor was she present at the time. Therefore, she should not be rashly convicted. As for the statements made by Zhou Qinji et al., which are unfavorable to themselves, as recorded in the

trial record,

Zhou Qinji answered, "My brother frequently went to my mother's room to inform her of everything. Afterwards, my mother went to my father's room, and my brother and I proposed how to dispose of the body," which not only cannot be used as evidence of the appellant's assistance but also serves to refute that, at the time of the premeditation, the appellant was visiting the body and did not participate in the plan, which is self-evident. Furthermore, observing Zhou Qinji's statement, "We brothers went to the room to discuss how to deal with the body, but without result," it is even more evident that even if the appellant was present, it was her sons Zhou Qinji et al. who participated in the discussion, and the matter discussed was only how to dispose of the body, without mentioning the plan to dismember it.

The term "dispose of the body"

does not necessarily refer to dismemberment. Interment is also a method of disposing of the body. This is the natural interpretation according to the tone. Even if her sons mentioned desecrating the body at that time, since there was no result of the discussion, it is clear that she had no knowledge of her sons' dismembering the body. How can it be presumed that she expressed agreement and provided assistance? Furthermore, how could she necessarily have seen or heard anything when the appellant was in a state of grief, fear, and diminished mental capacity? The original trial's assumption that the appellant was present and must have been consulted clearly shows conjecture and speculation. Conspiracy requires active behavior. Since the appellant did not join in the

deliberation of her sons

nor express any verbal support, the original trial's considering mere silence as active assistance is also contrary to the principles of criminal law regarding accessories. Furthermore, the appellant went downstairs at dawn (refer to the trial record). When she went downstairs, her sons had already left. Regarding everything that happened after they returned home and went upstairs, since the appellant did not go upstairs with them, there is no question of her knowing about it, let alone assisting. The original trial's claim that the appellant stayed downstairs in the kitchen to restrain the maid is also a hollow speculation. The purpose of surveillance is to prevent outsiders from

knowing and shouting. However, whether there was a need for outsiders to go upstairs at the time and whether the appellant prevented it was not investigated in the original trial, which is also inappropriate. As for the key, it may have been given temporarily by her sons after the incident. The appellant did not know the reason at the time. How can the appellant's failure to report the incident after the fact be used as a reason to pronounce judgment on a crime? Moreover, as a mother, how could she bear to do so again? One is moved by things, and there is no compensation for the loss of a husband. This is also what is unavoidable due to the great love of a mother. This is unconvincing.

Seeking Life from Death

In summary, the appellants are young and their will is unstable. Their minds are impaired, and education has provided little correction. They only relied on their stubborn and simplistic ideas, risking the crime of great impiety. They could not correct their father's misconduct, nor could they bear to watch their mother die. Their father had already destroyed his natural affection. With you, we have you. Without you, we have nothing. Furthermore, their mother may have been abused to death by their father. They feared that they might become motherless. Therefore, the appellants believed that if you are there, the mother will be saved. Judging the situation, the appellants'

criminal behavior

was not out of intent or malice. This is what Sima Qian meant when he said, "A minister kills his ruler, a son kills his father, not because of something that happened overnight, but because they all thought he was unaware of their plans." Furthermore, during times of intense warfare, it is easier to provoke those with diminished mental capacity. They often consider death to be commonplace. Western philosopher Nietzsche also believed that "war can cultivate the psychology of not adopting human methods and applying them." Therefore, the appellants are not only victims of a feudal society but also victims of the war era.

How can they not be pitied?

Defense counsel is in dispute. The reason why this shocking case of incest is discussed repeatedly is also due to Ouyang Xiu's father's belief in "seeking life from death," hoping to discover something within the bounds of law and reason. Otherwise, in this extraordinary time, the appellants have committed a shocking case of incest. According to the country's laws and regulations and societal morals, all those who uphold morality and ethics say that they deserve to be killed and that even killing them is not enough to cover their guilt. Why is the defense counsel willing to stand alone against the public and be condemned by society? The lawyer also believes that there is a clause that states, "There is reason to be lenient; the crime should be hidden." Based on the above statement,

we earnestly request a review

and a swift change to the original judgment, to grant leniency to the death sentences of the appellants Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxiang, and to declare the appellant Zhou Jing innocent, which would be fair. After receiving the petition, the Second Branch of the High Court will open a trial soon. At that time, the area next to the Second Branch of the High Court on Weihaiwei Road will be crowded with people and there will be no empty seats.

It goes without saying that China is lagging behind in science. However, we must not despise the glorious facts of history, which can also inspire us to catch up quickly. Many important things in foreign countries today were invented in China in the past. For example, the compass, which is indispensable in the shipping industry today, was invented by the Yellow Emperor thousands of years ago. The invention of printing technology was also earliest in our country. During the Five Dynasties period, Feng Dao invented woodblock printing. In the Song Dynasty, Bi Sheng invented movable type printing, and in the Ming Dynasty, Hua Sui and An Guo created copper movable type printing. Other things we use daily, such as porcelain, and weapons used in warfare, such as gunpowder, were all invented by the Chinese.

In recent years, the interest of Chinese people in scientific research has also become increasingly strong, and there have been many new inventions. Who says China has no inventors? Now, let us list fifteen people as follows:

(1) Zhong Ling invented the Zhong-style printing machine and pressure oil lamp. (2) Tang Zhongming invented the charcoal car. (3) Shu Zhendong invented the Chinese typewriter. (4) Qiu Bo'an invented multi-filament electric bulbs. (5) Wang Bonian, a water line engineer at the Yantai Telegraph Bureau, invented the Chinese telegraph machine. (6) Wang Zhenshan, a Chinese overseas Chinese in Singapore, invented the fuel injection engine car. (7) Si Tongzhen, of Jiang Shi Middle School in Fugou, Henan, invented a new-style waterwheel. (8) Feng Yongkang, of Yuxi, Yunnan, invented a silk weaving machine. (9) Sui Shaobo, of Beiping, invented the cotton comber. (10) Xiang Hui'an, of the China Black and White Society, invented a magnesium flashbulb camera capable of 1/1000 of a second. (11) Zhang Mingyi, an engineer on the Qingdao-Jinan Railway, used steel powder waste to make pig iron. (12) Ji Zhenggang, of Shaanxi, invented a new-style lever pedal for cotton ginning. (13) Qian Linzhao, the head of the Physics Research Institute of the National Research Institute of Beiping, invented the voltage crystal. (14) Zheng Miaoqing, of Hangzhou, invented fireproof cloth. (15) Huang Chao, a student studying abroad, invented bamboo gunpowder in Germany.

Smart children! Inventors are not extraordinary superhumans, nor is invention only for superhumans. As long as you can pay attention to observation, carry out precise experiments, and be patient and strong, you will surely succeed. Work hard! Success is waiting for you!

### We Should Have the Habit of Getting Up Early

— Fenfei

The weather is getting colder and colder, and you must be reluctant to leave your warm beds, but on the road, we often see foreign children, wearing very thin clothes, with their legs exposed, with their chests out and their backpacks on their backs, marching toward school with great energy! Looking back at our children, they are like little old men, wearing very thick clothes, moving slowly, and lacking any "vitality." What is the reason for this? I dare say that this is clear evidence of unsound physical condition. On the one hand, it is the unsoundness of the parents and the lack of innate qualities; on the other hand, it is the lack of attention to the importance of physical education and strict training.

The howling north wind outside is blowing hard, and it's still early? I'll get up in a while! Indeed, lying in a warm bed, everyone feels comfortable. However, time flies by, second by second, minute by minute, it just runs forward, and the clock on the wall goes "Dang! Dang!..." striking six! Part of your brain is telling you that now is the time to get up! Don't sleep anymore! If you don't get up, you'll be "late" again! Min'er finally struggled to get up, put on her clothes, ate her morning porridge, and walked to the street with her backpack on her back to fight the roaring north wind! Children, do you have the spirit of fighting? I hope you are not afraid of the cold, and quickly develop the habit of "getting up early," which can not only exercise your body but also use the morning time to review your homework, so why not do it? Look! Foreign children, are they afraid of the cold? The reason why they can resist the severe cold of winter is nothing more than the relationship between the strength and weakness of their bodies. If you have a healthy body, of course, you can resist the cold. A healthy body requires daily exercise, and winter is the best time for us to exercise.

Fathers and brothers! You must not spoil your children. You must know that the only way to exercise your body is at this time. Look, most of the children from Jiangbei everywhere are barefoot, but I have never seen them get "frostbite." At the same time, I have never seen them get "heat boils" in the summer. Isn't this evidence of exercise? I have never seen them "get sick" from the cold, so we must be like the children of Jiangbei, fighting against the cold! So that our weak bodies can be trained into strong bodies, and in winter, we must have the habit of "getting up early." Someone said it well: "Get up early, be healthy." That's really right!

### Small Science

— Cikai

Pour sifted, dried fine sand from a funnel. After a while, a round, conical sand tower will form underneath. After this sand tower reaches a certain height, the sand that falls down will slide down from the sides of the tower, and the area occupied by the tower will gradually expand. Therefore, we can never build a tall, pointed sand tower.

Scientists tell us that the slope of a sand tower cannot exceed thirty degrees. (Thirty degrees is as large as one-third of a square table corner.)

### New Year's Gamble – Memoirs of Seeking Refuge, Part 43 –

— Bai Zheng

The villagers were doing their best to enjoy the games they wanted to play during this short New Year's period. However, in such a remote village, besides a few dilapidated grocery stores, there was simply not a single teahouse or restaurant, let alone any theaters or game halls. Villagers who had grown up there and never left probably hadn't even dreamed of such things. So, what did they do for fun during the New Year? What exactly was there to spice up the New Year? Apart from the occasional firecracker, the new peach wood charms on the doors, and the new clothes on people, the sounds of dice and bamboo tiles became their only New Year decorations and their only form of entertainment.

In front of the ancestral hall, on the open square, many adults and children gathered around all sorts of small stalls, which was a special New Year scene. The crowd over there was exceptionally lively, bustling with activity. The sounds of talking, laughing... filled the air around it, as if a large swarm of bees were buzzing loudly. The stalls were all run by families in the village who were quite wealthy. Seeing this once-a-year opportunity, they came up with these new ideas, hoping to make an easy profit during the New Year. With a small investment, they bought some colorful candies, scrubbed a table clean, covered it with clean and bright five-colored paper, and came up with things like spinning wheels, lotteries, and raffles... In short, these were all things that children liked and that suited their psychology, because these games allowed them to get a lot of candy for a small amount of money. Who wouldn't be happy to do that? Those ignorant children were drawn in and couldn't leave, clustering around the stalls like a swarm of bees attracted to sweet flowers. They kept asking their parents for money, but the money was always lost before they even tasted the candy. Therefore, there were often some cries mixed in with the laughter and talking, creating a discordant musical trio.

Further on, there was the adults' New Year club: many tables lined up along a dead-end road. People were also gathered in small groups around the tables. The tables were covered with white tablecloths, and a neatly dressed person sat there dealing the tiles. People standing around placed their banknotes and small coins as bets. Then, two dice were thrown, and the tiles were quickly separated and turned over. The dealer "ate" or "matched" the banknotes on the table. They were playing Pai Gow, and the stakes seemed particularly high, because the tabletop was covered with small coins and banknotes. Further on, a group of people were making a racket of dice and bowls clashing, playing "Old Crow".

Ming'er was very excited as he strolled around, looking at everything. He stood watching the dice game for quite a while, seeing someone who had already won a large pile of banknotes still standing there, refusing to leave, putting all his banknotes on the table. The dealer had almost lost everything. Seeing that he was still betting, he stood up and threw the dice very forcefully, with an ugly and indescribable expression on his face. As he threw the dice, he shouted in a sharp tone, hoping to "eat" the banknotes, while the person betting shouted insults. The two of them were fighting for money, and the situation was quite tense. This was a crucial moment. If the dealer won, he could not only break even but also make money. The person betting had worked hard and won so much money, but he was still not satisfied and made this all-or-nothing bet, hoping to get double the money. Both of them had a strong ambition. Therefore, the six dice were spinning at the bottom of the bowl, their movement being greatly related to their gains and losses. Their pairs of eyes were staring sharply into the bowl, but their minds were completely different. This was an ugly scene of people becoming ferocious for money. Money! Money! It's really a good thing! But also a bad thing!

### The Blue Dwarf (9)

— Ai Li

Ah Li hastily said, "I'm sorry, I – I really don't know." The dwarves also said in unison, "Yes, we don't know either." Ah Li smiled slightly and said, "Do you mean you don't know my name? Then let me tell you first, my name is Ah Li!" The dwarves continued to stare blankly as if they hadn't heard. Ah Li then repeated, "My name is Ah Li!"

The dwarves replied, "Ah Li, Ah Li, what a good name! Just call us Blue. We've all come here together to invite you to our village for supper. After you've eaten, you'll know that our cooking is not bad either!" Seeing them so polite, Ah Li said uneasily, "Thank you for your kindness. If the road isn't far, I'll definitely come along, but I'm afraid I won't be able to eat much. To be honest, I don't feel hungry." As she spoke, she took a piece of bread from her bag and said, "Besides, I have bread here. I couldn't finish it when I had coffee earlier, so I brought it with me."

Immediately, several dwarves came closer, carefully examining the piece of bread. They reached out and stroked it, and then sniffed it. One of the dwarves even stuck out his tongue and licked it. His eyes widened, showing a surprised expression, and he looked at Ah Li and said, "This thing isn't good." Ah Li quickly said, "But I don't think there's anything wrong with it. This is country bread. If you lived in that village over there, you'd have to eat this too."

The two dwarves didn't pay attention to Ah Li's words, but turned around and shouted sharply, "Come here, everyone!" The other dwarves responded in unison, their voices equally sharp. Ah Li was surprised to see them all coming. But the dwarf on the bucket didn't jump down, still coming over on the bucket. The one bending his knees also continued to bend his knees as he came over. Even the one doing somersaults still did somersaults as he came over. In an instant, all the dwarves had gathered at her feet.

Ah Li looked up and suddenly saw a large robe hanging from a tree in front of her, looking very much like her aunt's traveling coat, but the color was the same light blue as the dwarves' clothes. Ah Li understood that this robe was especially for her to wear. She stood up, reached out, took the robe, and put it on. She happily muttered to herself, "Now I'll definitely be able to experience some new and interesting things."

Then the dwarves started to move forward—no, you can't say they were moving forward, you can only say they were wriggling forward. Ah Li was in the middle of them, letting them crowd around her as they went forward. The blue robe she wore was blowing in the wind, looking particularly beautiful. Everyone just hurried on their way, without saying a word. The sky was getting dark, and the forest was even darker, but Ah Li wasn't surprised. They walked for a while, and finally saw a small point of bright blue light flickering ahead. This blue light seemed to be no bigger than a firefly, but it was particularly bright and sparkling in the darkness. As soon as the dwarves saw this blue light, they shouted, and as soon as the shout stopped, they began to sing. What do you think they were singing? Ah Li didn't believe it at first, but after listening carefully, she was absolutely certain that they were singing the famous English song "Home, Sweet Home." The strangest thing was that they sang it beautifully, and it sounded exactly like her aunt's voice.

### Regarding the "All-Star Gathering of the Kylin School"

— Wei Wo

It has been reported in the previous newspaper that the Refugee Relief Association will hold a charity performance for four days starting on the 27th of this month, and will hold an "All-Star Gathering of the Kylin School" for one day based on my suggestion. Yesterday (the 17th) at 4 p.m., the officials in charge of the Refugee Relief Association, Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng, specifically hosted a banquet at the Atlantic Restaurant to invite performers from both the amateur and professional circles to finalize the schedule and program, as follows:

November 27th, Day Performance: Comic Suzhou Ballad Singing, Kunqu Opera All-Star Gathering, Night Performance: Famous Performers All-Star Gathering

28th, Day Performance: Shanghai Opera All-Star Gathering, Night Performance: Amateur Performers All-Star Gathering

29th, Day Performance: Spoken Drama All-Star Gathering, Night Performance: Movie Stars All-Star Gathering

30th, Day Performance: Famous Performers All-Star Gathering, Night Performance: Amateur Performers All-Star Gathering

In the above program, the Famous Performers All-Star Gathering on the evening of the 27th is a completely new stage performance, led by Wu Suqiu. The Famous Performers All-Star Gathering on the day performance of the 30th was originally planned to be an "All-Star Gathering of the Kylin School." However, after discussion, it was decided that the "All-Star Gathering of the Kylin School" was limited to the Kylin School, which was a narrower scope. It would be better to hold a joint performance by actors from various theaters, which would be more lively. Therefore, the Famous Performers All-Star Gathering on the day performance of the 30th was changed to a joint performance. The program has already been scheduled, roughly as follows:

(1)

Yuan Xiaolou, Wang Shaolou, Li Zhonglin, Liu Hanchen, Gao Xueqiao

Huang Baoyan, Lu Maobao, Xu Yunting, Wang Fuying, Wang Guiqing

The Three Iron Roosters

(2)

Xue Youqin, Wang Xichun, Zhang Shuxian, Mao Jianqiu

Zhang Shulan, Xin Suwen, Yu Sulian, Li Xuefang

Eight Performances of Five Caves of Flowers

(3)

Zhao Ruquan (Guan Yu), Zhou Xinfang (Huang Zhong), Liu Kunrong (Wei Yan)

Battle of Changsha

The above program has been decided after much consideration and is unlikely to change again. However, based on the above program, there are two major shortcomings: (1) The time is only 13 quarters of an hour. In the past, the regulations for joint performances were to perform for six hours, which is a large difference; (2) The finale, "Battle of Changsha," although it is currently a popular play, was previously performed by Yuan Shihai as Wei Yan at Yu's house. The popularity of this play lies in the equal skill of the three performers. Now, replacing Yuan Shihai with Liu Kunrong is a difference that cannot be justified. It can be determined that the performance of this play will not be as good as the previous performance by Zhou, Zhao, and Yuan.

As for the so-called All-Star Gathering of the Kylin School, it is expected that it will be able to attract attention and generate interest. Therefore, it has been decided to hold it, but the four-day charity performance will not be performed for the time being. It has been decided to hold a public performance at the Tianchan Theater on the 7th of next month. The program is roughly the same as what was proposed in this publication on September 1st, but Zhao Ruquan, Zhao Songqiao, Wang Chunbai, and others will be added, and the name will be changed to "All-Star Gathering of Civil and Military Senior Actors." The two Zhaos and one Wang will jointly perform the play "Gaoping Pass," and at the same time, famous amateurs Sun Lanting, Zhang Zhongyuan, and Qi Jun and others will guest star in a Kylin School play. Although it is called "All-Star Gathering of Civil and Military Senior Actors," it is actually based on the "Kylin School Gathering." It is expected that the public performance will be a sensation in the theater world.

### Casual Talk on "Golden Jade Filled Hall" - Grand Opening Premiere at the Dahua Theater

— Meng

"Golden Jade Filled Hall" is the first film to premiere at the Dahua Theater and is also the first collaboration between child stars Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland.

They both have very brilliant performances in this film. Especially Mickey Rooney's acting skills, he not only maintains his superb performance in "Children's Paradise," but also shows off his never-before-seen stunts. He plays the piano skillfully and fluently, singing while playing, fully demonstrating his musical literacy. In addition, he blackened his face and sang passionately, which is not inferior to Eddie Cantor's singing. The most amazing thing is that he imitates Clark Gable's and Lionel Barrymore's tone and expression, "a perfect likeness." The main show of his performance can be said to be the highest record of Mickey Rooney's films.

Judy Garland's singing has always been on par with Deanna Durbin. Her tone has a sweet and intoxicating magic, and her dance steps have a fascinating heat. Her performance in "Golden Jade Filled Hall" is a perfect match with Mickey Rooney, like a red peony and green leaves, complementing each other. All the actors involved in the supporting cast are minor boys and girls. The performance is very lively and humorous, making people smile from beginning to end.

All American film publications unanimously recommend this film as a rare singing film in recent years. The Dahua Theater adopted it as the opening film, which shows its importance.

### Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland Co-Star in "Golden Jade Filled Hall"... Two Little Ones Without Guessing

### Thoughts on "The Miser"

— Bing Jiu

Shortly after the performance of "Before Sunrise," the Baolian Drama Troupe staged the world-famous "The Miser" at the Carlton on Sunday morning of last week. The script was adapted by Gu Zhongyi from Molière's "The Miser." The whole play is full of humorous and satirical atmosphere. First of all, we cannot praise too much Director Wu Ming's handling of the scenes. Each act can grasp the audience's tense emotions and infuse them with a painful tone, which is realized from laughter. However, due to the difficulty of controlling the characters, some scenes are not as satisfactory as expected. In terms of performance, Yan Yan's Hua Binggang is quite successful, but his movements seem not very calm. Zhang Yongqing's Mingxi is also very good, but the last scene is not performed realistically enough. Han Yan's Chuan Niangzi is too artificial and unnatural. Liao Jiaai's Hua Ying is too dull. Tong Hua's Zhang Asi is very experienced in acting, and his inner performance is also profound. Although he is too hard-working, he is inevitably a little too much like a civilized drama. Other lighting, scenery, and makeup are all kept as simple as possible. Under the principle of "only seeking no mistakes," it may not be a smart approach.

### Possible Evolution of the Western Front of the European War

Hitler May Adopt a Surprising Blitzkrieg Tactics - This Depends on Whether German Aircraft Overwhelms the British and French Forces

Hitler is hovering between war and peace.

Although neutral countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium have called for peace, both Britain and France have stated that there is no possibility of peaceful coexistence unless the Nazis change their policy of aggression. In this situation, in order to win the war and prevent the collapse of the German National Socialist Party's regime, Hitler must break the long-term encirclement policy in order to resolve the war quickly.

Air Combat Strength

In the war against Poland, within twenty days, the German army defeated the Polish army like a swift wind sweeping away fallen leaves. The reason for the success of the German blitzkrieg tactics was that its air force was far superior to that of Poland. Germany had as many as 3,000 first-class aircraft in the war against Poland, while Poland only had 360 aircraft. Because Hitler had such air superiority, he destroyed the Polish air force base in one fell swoop, achieving the goal of a quick victory. However, the situation in the war against France is completely different from that in the war against Poland. Although Germany is stronger than the total number of British and French aircraft in terms of fighter jets, fighter jets can be shot down by fighter escorts. Britain and France have the advantage in this regard. In addition to their own production, a large part of the fighter escorts in the British and French air forces are purchased from the United States. The American Curtiss factory supplied a large number of fighter escorts to Britain and France. After the amendment of the new American neutrality law, Britain and France will inevitably be in a more advantageous position than Germany in terms of the import of American aircraft and military supplies in the future, due to their superiority in sea and air transport compared to Germany, their stronger financial resources, and the United States' sympathy for Britain and France. There is no doubt that this will be a greater blow to Germany.

In this air war in Western Europe, according to the official statistics of Britain and France, the loss of British and French fighter escorts was eight, while the loss of Germany was twenty-four. That is a ratio of one to three. The loss of bombers is greater for Britain and France. This is because Britain and France wanted to bomb Germany's heavily defended military centers. On the other hand, if German aircraft make the same attempt to bomb British and French military centers, their losses will inevitably be equal.

Comparison of Tanks on Both Sides

In addition to the air force, Germany's other weapon is mechanized units. Because of the development of its heavy industry, Germany's tank production is extremely rapid, and its number may exceed that of Britain and France. However, French tanks are superior to German tanks. French tanks are lighter and faster. The outside of the 11-ton, 20-ton, and 28-ton tanks is covered with special steel armor, which is almost impenetrable by artillery. This is a secret manufacturing by the British and French, which cannot be imitated by the Germans.

Germany's Possible Military Strategies

Since France has such superior air and land war weapons, plus the impregnable Maginot Line for defense, in order to wage a protracted war, it is impossible for Germany to take the offensive from the Western Front to annihilate the British and French forces and achieve an overwhelming victory in fact. If Germany resorts to a surprise attack, bypasses the rear of France, and defeats the British and French Allied forces, then it must pass through the Netherlands, Belgium, or Switzerland. Germany has concentrated its troops on the border of the Netherlands and Belgium, which was once a hot topic. When necessary, Germany may act without regard to everything. At that time, more countries will be involved in the war, and the scope of the war will inevitably become wider.

### Old Mrs. Zhao

— Ju

...The Mother of the Jinan Team Praised by Outsiders...

Female heroes in ancient China are countless in history, but it is rare for an illiterate woman, already fifty-eight years old, to lead her more than thirty children and grandchildren to resist foreign aggression. Such a "whole family resisting the war" is really worth advocating and imitating at the moment. Therefore, the reason why Old Mrs. Zhao is called the mother of the guerrillas and is warmly welcomed everywhere shows that it is not blind worship, nor is it accidental.

The photo of Old Mrs. Zhao below is published in this year's American publication, Asia Magazine. Its description is "Old Mrs. Zhao, who is called the mother of the guerrillas, has given speeches to encourage the Chinese people no less than a thousand times, and has raised tens of thousands of yuan for the guerrillas. She is an illiterate peasant woman who encouraged farmers to resist Japan in her former hometown, a village in Manchuria, and fought with the guerrillas, and has not stopped until now. Her son, Zhao Tong, organized an army of about 20,000 people to fight in Hebei after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. This army has close ties with the Eighth Route Army, and its officers are almost all trained by the Eighth Route Army." It can be seen that outsiders also pay attention to it.

The old lady's name is Zhao Hongguowen. Since February of the 21st year of the Republic of China, she has donated her family property to the Volunteer Army, and the whole family has joined the work. She personally founded more than 30,000 North China guerrillas, who fought in various provinces in Northeast and North China, from the Changbai Mountains to the Taihang Mountains. Although she is old, she is energetic and her voice is as loud as a bell. In February of this year, she took a plane to Chongqing, and many people welcomed her at the airport.

When she was in Kunming, the Provincial Party Department held a meeting to welcome her. She attended and gave a speech, with more than 5,000 listeners. She told reporters in Kunming: "I don't want to be a mother of a family, I want to be a mother of the masses. I send my children and grandchildren to the guerrillas. I think every mother should send her children to the front line to fight with the enemy, and every mother should also join the front line."

The ancients have a saying: "Strong grass is known in a strong wind, and heroes emerge in troubled times." At this time of national crisis, not only male national heroes are emerging, but also female national heroes are rising up. This is also the inevitable law of cause and effect.

### Hitler's Will

— Guan

Recently, in the East End of London, there has been a batch of novel newspaper sellers, shouting in their mouths: "Do you want to see Hitler's will and last words!"

If you spend a few pence, you can buy a copy, which begins: "The painter Hitler, who led Germany astray, the famous madman of Europe ×" Fearing an accident, a will is prepared in advance, and so on. The following are a few sections of the will:

"All the German people who trust me give to the mute government. (Meaning that in an all-powerful country, everyone except the dictator is mute. Translator)"

"All my medals are given to Goering. The weight of the medals, including himself, will make him kneel down."

"My Struggle" is given to Aseren, please review it again." (This is probably because there are many places in the book that scold the Soviet Union! Translator)"

"My beard is given to Chaplin, because this thing is grown in imitation of him."

"My will should be executed by Ribbentrop and Goering, because they have the experience to execute it."

Finally, he needs to be embalmed in a fireproof asbestos coffin. After the burial, the German Parliament should declare that "Hell" is incorporated into the German territory. He said: "Hell, I have tried many ways to give it to the German people, and it should rightfully belong to the motherland."

Economic Knowledge

### Internal Exchange Management

— Si Xing

The economic development of our country has always been extremely unbalanced, with most of the capital concentrated in a few important coastal cities. Of this capital, very little is actually engaged in national industry; most is colluding with foreign capital, forming the so-called comprador capital. Since the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, in order to disperse funds and build up the rear, the government has provided great encouragement and assistance for the internal transfer of funds and industry. A considerable number of industrialists with foresight have moved their factories inland. However, a significant number remain who are content with the status quo, seeking refuge in the concessions, and reorganizing their old businesses. Furthermore, the arrival of refugees from various places in Shanghai, bringing with them large amounts of capital, has created an unprecedented and peculiar prosperity in Shanghai, as well as a huge trade deficit. This phenomenon is obviously abnormal and unreasonable. Recently, the government has deeply realized that this situation should not be allowed to continue, and has ordered the four banks - Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China - to form a Domestic Exchange Management Committee to implement internal exchange controls. The committee is located at the headquarters of the four banks in Chongqing, with branches established throughout the country, attached to the four banks. Regulations stipulate that remittances from the interior to occupied coastal areas such as Shanghai and Tianjin are limited to the purchase of necessities, and must be applied for to the Exchange Management Committee, providing supporting documents showing the purpose, amount, destination, and merchant details. However, remittances from Shanghai to the interior are granted various conveniences. Remittances to any location in the interior are exempt from remittance fees, and when Shanghai makes remittances, the interior can still receive the full amount in cash. This internal exchange management method is undoubtedly an effective and reasonable measure aimed at the current abnormal situation.

Before the implementation of internal exchange management, funds from the interior rushed to escape to Shanghai. Statistics show that remittances from Yunnan, Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, and other places to Shanghai constantly exceeded 100,000 yuan per day. The government had no overall solution to this, and only showed slight restraint in a passive manner, such as changing the payment of government bond interest to Chongqing in cash, and Shanghai paying discounted drafts in installments. Since the implementation of management, remittances from the interior to Shanghai have become much more difficult. The previous regulation of 1,000 yuan per person per day has now been reduced to a maximum of 100 yuan, and post offices can only remit 50 yuan. Regarding exchange rates, remittances from Yunnan and Chongqing to Shanghai require 1,400 or 1,500 yuan in local cash to obtain a 1,000 yuan draft in Shanghai. If cash is required, an even greater premium is needed. Therefore, the daily amount of remittances from the interior to Shanghai has now been reduced to between 20,000 yuan. On the other hand, remittances from Shanghai to the interior have surged since the implementation of internal exchange management. Not only are remittance fees waived, but there is also a premium. Ordinary remittances to Kunming, Chongqing, and other places only require 70 to 80 yuan in Shanghai for every 100 yuan remitted.

The purpose of internal exchange management is twofold: negatively, it is to prevent the outflow of funds from the interior, preventing them from falling into enemy hands; positively, it is to encourage the internal transfer of funds from Shanghai, for national use. As for the decline of Shanghai's prosperity, its signs are now gradually emerging. Those who possess capital should take this opportunity to open up our new world in the southwest and northwest.

### A Deaf Person Cannot Hear the Alarm

Since the outbreak of war in Europe, London, England, has been constantly attacked by the German air force. Although the air defense equipment is very complete, people still have to take temporary shelter in air raid shelters when alarms sound. A couple among the residents are both deaf and often cannot hear the alarm at night, which is quite distressing. They wrote to the question-and-answer column of a magazine for a solution. The reply stated: There is no other way but to ask the neighbors to notify them. This is also a regret for those with incomplete sensory organs.

### War and War Expenses

— Wei

The total military expenditure of the belligerent countries in the First World War amounted to 350 billion yuan. The war lasted for 1,665 days, with an average daily expenditure of 224 million yuan. Among them:

Britain: 71.9 billion yuan (accounting for 46% of national wealth)

France: 57 billion yuan (accounting for 55% of national wealth)

Germany: 66.6 billion yuan (accounting for 44% of national wealth)

United States: 46.1 billion yuan (accounting for 9% of national wealth)

Japan's war expenses for invading China have been increasing year by year. If the war continues to drag on, it will inevitably go bankrupt one day. Now, let's compare the war expenses of its previous foreign wars:

Sino-Japanese War (1894): 25 million yuan

Russo-Japanese War (1904): 170 million yuan

Current Sino-Japanese War: 1.19 billion yuan

### Aspects of the Astrology Industry

Predicting Fortune and Misfortune Everywhere

When everyone is frustrated, the only hope is the shift in destiny, as so-called by fatalists, to have good luck and make a fortune. It can be said that people have the same heart and the same reason, so astrologers who predict fortune and misfortune are born in response to the times and flourish.

Ordinary astrologers mostly rent a house along the road, writing the words "So-and-so Fortune Telling Hall" or "So-and-so Establishes a Desk" at the door. Some even write some four-six essays as self-introductions, always using the phrases "Young, indulged in writing; old, fond of astrology; speaking of fortune and misfortune in the future, hitting the mark every time, like a precious raft in a maze, clearly indicating the direction; gentlemen who want to ask about their future, please come and try." Those who initially put up a sign often use the phrase "Visiting a friend but not meeting them, temporarily setting up a desk here." They advertise in the newspaper, adding a photo of themselves for publicity.

The Founders of the Astrology Industry

The books they read are probably no more than four types: the Ma Yi Physiognomy, the Liu Zhuang Physiognomy, the Divine Physiognomy Iron Sabre, and the Water Mirror Collection. It is said that Ma Yi was the teacher of Chen Tuan, Liu Zhuang was Yuan Zhongfu of the Ming Dynasty, the Divine Physiognomy Iron Sabre was written by an old monk called Yun Gu Shan Ren, and the Water Mirror Collection was written by Fan Wenyuan. These four books are complete with physiognomy for form, spirit, complexion, bone, flesh, moles, etc. However, there are obvious differences between men and women.

The Grades of the Astrology Industry

As for those who take a piece of chalk and draw a hand on the sidewalk next to the road, telling stories to make passers-by stop and watch, they randomly grab a spectator's hand, arbitrarily criticizing and predicting that person's fate. After finishing the story, they ask the person to take out five cents or a dime as a fortune-telling fee. This is also a common occurrence. It is said that these people are called itinerant fortune-tellers, and can be divided into four types: The first type is the so-called hanging a portrait. Wherever they go, they hang a half-length portrait of a square-faced, big-eared person on the wall. The old ones are portraits of a red-topped, feathered official, and the modern ones are dressed in suits. They can follow everything in the painting to guide people through their confusion. When they see a passerby, they say something like "Your Honor's Saturn is so prominent that you should have made a fortune long ago, but unfortunately the complexion on your face is not very good." When the passerby hears this tense tone, they immediately stop, and the business is successful. As for those astrologers who live in inns and reveal the portrait of a certain nobleman at the door, they are also a unique way of hanging a portrait.

The second type is called snatching a handkerchief, which means that these types of individuals do not have real skills but randomly grab someone passing by to tell their fortune based on their silver tongue to attract spectators to have a look at their hand for ten or twenty cents.

The third type is called bone-touching fortune-telling, which is a unique type of fortune-telling. They rely on the secrets of bone physiognomy in the Iron Sabre, and even illiterate people make a living by touching bones.

The fourth type is called hand-measuring fortune-telling, which is generally chosen in a quiet place in the midst of the hustle and bustle. They carry a small copper ruler, a piece of coarse thread, and a cloth scroll with two or thirty hands drawn on it. By measuring the length of the fingers, they can determine your lifelong honor and disgrace. This is the simplest type of itinerant fortune-telling.

### Recent Situation in Kangding

— Xing

Kangding is the provincial capital of Xikang Province, located west of Luding Mountain, north of Mianning, east of Lihua, and south of Danba, in the southern section of the Daxue Mountains. The terrain protrudes from the plateau, which is more than 8,700 feet above sea level. The climate is cold all year round, the population is complex, and commerce is prosperous. It is the main hub for import and export trade in Xikang Province, and is also one of the important cities in several southwestern provinces of China.

A Glimpse of the City of Kangding

Kangding is a place where Han, Tibetan, and Kang people live together, so it was impossible to unify until recently. Now it has been completely renewed. There are now two banks, one cinema, one Sichuan opera theater, and two or three slightly larger hotels and inns in the city, decorating the city. The busiest streets in the county town are Zhongshan Street and Zhongzheng Street. The two streets are located on the east and west banks of the city river, with three large wooden bridges connecting the traffic on both banks.

A Glimpse of Xikang's Products

The climate is cold, and even in summer, you have to wear a coat, flannel vest, cotton jacket, and fur coat. The highest temperature in summer is 30 degrees Fahrenheit, and in winter it is 20 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. Summer vegetables include radishes, fresh broad beans, peas, green beans, and second-crop beans. The only meat is beef and pork. However, the local people do not eat aquatic animals such as fish. Because after the local people die, they feed the fish with their bodies, which is called "water burial," a peculiar custom in Kangding. Therefore, the local people believe that "fish" is a sacred and inviolable animal.

Life is Quite Expensive

Kangding's cost of living is known as the highest in the country because transportation is inconvenient and difficult. Food and daily necessities all rely on manual carrying and import, and procurement must be done as far away as Chengdu, Kunming, and Ya'an. Therefore, prices are high, and in recent months, hundreds of residents have moved into Kangding from other provinces due to the war. Therefore, prices have soared, and life has become even more difficult. The prices of foreign goods and consumables on the market are seven or eight times more expensive than in Shanghai, and some are even more than ten times more expensive. However, local goods have also skyrocketed due to the sudden increase in population and the demand for everything exceeding supply. Even fresh pork costs 1.70 or 1.80 yuan per catty, flour costs more than 20 yuan per bag, rice costs more than 30 yuan per load, foreign candles cost 2.60 yuan per dozen, washbasins cost 4.60 yuan each (about 1 yuan in Shanghai), inferior socks cost 70 cents per pair (the most expensive in Shanghai costs about 20 cents), a bar of soap costs 30 cents, and morning tea biscuits cost nearly 2 yuan per pound, and vegetable oil costs 90 cents per catty. Therefore, a poor person like a porter or footman needs at least one yuan for daily living expenses, so the living expenses of a wealthy person are unbelievable!

A Glimpse of Xikang's Currency System

Kangding is the throat of trade in Xikang Province. Imports are dominated by tea, amounting to millions of yuan each year; exports include medicinal materials, wool, ox tails, musk, and food. All transactions are done in Tibetan silver dollars. Recently, the government issued an order throughout Xikang Province that all transactions must be done in legal tender. Therefore, the Bank of Xikang Province issued 5-cent Tibetan currency notes (see attached photo) to circulate in the market in order to collect Tibetan silver dollars to consolidate the unification of the currency system. One Tibetan silver dollar is equivalent to about 50 cents in legal tender, and each dime is equivalent to ten large copper coins, each worth 200 wen.

A Glimpse of People's Clothing

The clothing of the people of Kangding is quite unique. A few of the clothing styles imitate Han Chinese styles. Most of them have large tops, bare chests and arms, short knives hanging from their waists, long leather boots on their feet, brown faces, and various colored local cloths wrapped around their heads. However, the clothes of the poor are also tattered and stained with oil, making one want to vomit! The women are all tall and have the typical "healthy beauty." Compared to the weak and frail women of the South, there is a world of difference! Every morning and evening, women carry buckets of water on their backs and pass through the streets in an endless stream.

Special Food: Butter Tea

The local people all use butter tea as their daily drink (butter tea: made by mixing butter and tea). Fine butter tea also adds some walnut meat, floating on the tea surface, which tastes fragrant and exotic. Purely refined butter is also quite clean and hygienic, not inferior to the "Beauty Brand" butter sold in Shanghai. Every day, a pound is weighed and sold for 4 yuan and 40 cents in Tibetan currency (2 yuan and 20 cents in legal tender). Ordinary butter is sandwiched in pot blocks (large sesame cakes) as a substitute for rice or snacks, which is actually a kind of nutritious food. The poor people of Sichuan and Kang all use pearl rice as food, but the wealthy still eat rice. However, their method of cooking rice is slightly different from that of the southerners. First, the rice is boiled in water until hot, then the rice soup is poured out, and then the rice is steamed. The vitamins in this rice are actually all lost. Therefore, the so-called eating rice in Kangding is only eating the residue of the rice. There is also a common habit: everyone only eats two meals a day. Lunch is eaten at 11:00 AM, and dinner is eaten at 3:00 PM. Most of the remaining time is spent eating snacks, so the consumption of snacks by the people of Kangding is actually more expensive than one meal a day in the South!

Wealthy people use radios in the evening to listen to news and war reports from the Chengdu Transportation Department Radio Station, but the radio antennas in the entire city are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns!

### Molybdenum and Indium: Rare Metals for Military Use

— Ju

Have you ever heard of molybdenum, indium, and beryllium? These metals will become as common as chromium (i.e., chrome), platinum (i.e., white gold), and aluminum in the future. These three metals are extremely needed in the military, so they will inspire a new industry because of the war.

Molybdenum is currently scarce, and its value is one British pound per pound. Molybdenum ore only exists in Colorado, and before the war, it was already a metal in short supply. Its use is to be mixed into steel, which can make steel avoid the weakness of being brittle and easy to break. Armored vehicles, steel plates, and gun barrels all need this molybdenum steel alloy.

Indium is a metal that is softer than lead, brighter than silver, and lighter than zinc, and it never rusts. Six years ago, it was worth 60 pounds per ounce, but now it is only worth 6 pounds, and there is a trend for it to become cheaper. Indium is almost like wax, and it melts at a temperature slightly higher than body temperature, so it is most useful for filling gaps and is indispensable for manufacturing aircraft. Before the war, copper was used as a tool for shaping extremely good molds, such as sculptures and dental molds. Other things like lithography also needed indium. During the war, it replaced plaster of Paris, using it to bandage the broken bones of wounded soldiers. The inconvenience of surgeons using plaster of Paris has now been completely eliminated.

Beryllium is another newly discovered metal, and it is extracted from magnesite ore after carbonization of magnesium. It is half the weight of aluminum but very durable. So, there is really nothing better than beryllium for manufacturing aircraft engines and fuselages.

There is another mysterious metal called beryllium, which is quite valuable, costing 5,000 pounds per pound. It is very difficult to purify. Its use, in addition to being used as the base for beryl stones for decoration, has not yet been discovered for anything else. The treasures in minerals are increasing day by day, which really makes people feel the sense of "life is finite, but knowledge is infinite"!

Scientific Warfare on the Western Front

### German Positions Surpass Zhuge Liang's Eight Trigrams Formation; French Army Uses Large Numbers of Pigs to Charge

— Wei

- "Invisible Men" and "Robots" Also Appear -

The more advanced science becomes, the more novel the tactics become. During this European war, when the German army used all its strength to attack Poland, it only maintained strict vigilance on the western front and temporarily adopted a defensive posture. It used many scientific methods to deploy so-called trap warfare. Its wonder may be more than ten thousand times better than the "Zhuge Liang's Eight Trigrams Formation" described in old Chinese novels. According to soldiers who participated in the Battle of the Huarend Forest, in that area, all appliances and objects were explosive or had deadly electric currents. Once touched, they would immediately fall to the ground and die. For example, a horse's reins placed on the ground would be electrocuted to death if accidentally touched. A dead pig abandoned on the battlefield would detonate a landmine once approached. A French officer rode a bicycle to check the remains of a German soldier, but unexpectedly, explosives were also hidden on the body, and it exploded suddenly, resulting in disaster. Also, when walking on the grass, the moment your foot landed, it would trigger a mechanism and cause a landmine to explode. Even more strangely, even if the German soldiers escaped from the fortress location, you could not rush in rashly, because their defenses were often equipped with many machine guns that automatically fired densely using infrared rays. In addition, all things left behind by the German army, even grass roots and treetops, were equipped with landmine explosion mechanisms, making it impossible to guard against, so it was easy to suffer losses.

However, even though the German army had such amazing formations and clever plans, the French army's method of breaking the formations was even more interesting. Before entering the enemy's position, they first used a group of pigs as a vanguard. They let the pigs run around, and wherever there were landmines, they would all explode once touched, only sacrificing a few pigs, but completely breaking the enemy's traps. Isn't that even better? Even more advanced, the French army also created countless "robots" to charge forward and clear landmines. There were also so-called "invisible men" who penetrated deep into enemy territory, repeatedly achieving miraculous feats in reconnaissance, attack, and occupation tactics. Such a war can truly be said to be fighting wits rather than strength. Customs and Anecdotes

### Custom of Moving Coffins in Kowloon

— Zhu Wei

In Kowloon, there is an interesting custom. Coffins are not allowed to be carried up or down the stairs. Therefore, even if the coffin is on the sixth or seventh floor, it must be hoisted from the window along the road. After the encoffining is completed, it must still be lowered from the window to the road. The procedure is difficult and there are many dangers.

### Brief Notes

The heart of a fish has one chamber, amphibians have two, reptiles have traces of four chambers, and mammals all have four chambers.

The largest tree in the world is in the Kolkata Botanical Garden in India. The tree can hold 10,000 people inside. The tree is 100 feet high and 857 feet in circumference.

The only mammals that can truly fly are bats. Bats can fly quickly in the dark, not because of their eyes. Their wings have a fine mesh of nerves that can sense the slightest vibrations caused by air currents striking solid objects, so they can fly through dense forests in the dark without touching trees.

Of all animals, snails have the largest range of distribution, from sea level to above the snow line of the Himalayas. They also have colonies in the sea, and people have obtained snail specimens from 16,000 feet below the ocean surface.

The water in the Atlantic Ocean is clearest in the Sargasso Sea.
