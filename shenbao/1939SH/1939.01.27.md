### President Chiang's Address at the Fifth Plenary Session: Using Facts to Prove Victory in the War of Resistance is Inevitable

(Continued from yesterday) After understanding the various examples of enemy self-inflicted failures and self-made sins that I have listed above, comrades, you can understand that in this Sino-Japanese War, if Japan can achieve victory, then all strategies, tactics, and all military theories in the world will have to be fundamentally overturned, and even the principles and theories of all things can be proven useless. After understanding the significance of the enemy's various means of coercion and inducement to surrender today, comrades, you can even more clearly understand what we should strive to uphold. To put it plainly, it is to be determined, unyielding, that is to say, our spirit must absolutely not be coerced by the enemy, and we must absolutely not be deceived by the enemy. We must persist in resisting the war and fighting to the end, not only to prevent the enemy from achieving their past goal of "quick victory," but also to shatter their current cunning plan of "quick peace." This is our only strategy today. This is the foundation for the enemy's defeat and our country's victory. I solemnly tell you, comrades, this is the conclusion I have drawn from deep contemplation over the past eighteen months, in my position as commander-in-chief entrusted with the heavy responsibility of the nation's safety and security, and I specially offer it to all comrades of our plenary session. All of you comrades should further make the entire nation understand that we must today take the history of the Song and Ming dynasties as a cautionary tale. We must know that the demise of the Song and Ming dynasties was not because the enemy foreign tribes had any superior strength, but entirely due to the wavering and timidity of the will and spirit of a small number of generals and officials and the social elite of the time, and even the people of the whole country were affected by them, leading to the failure of the overall situation, which could not be remedied. Today, we have such a good national spirit, such a profound revolutionary foundation, and our party's Three Principles of the People, which are suitable for the times. As long as we do not abandon ourselves, no force can destroy our country. Today's situation is very clear. What is placed before us is that the enemy will inevitably rely on their weapons and military force to make a more ferocious, desperate struggle. Our policy, however, is very simple and clear. From the beginning of the second phase of the War of Resistance, we must use our revolutionary strategies and tactics to fundamentally strike the enemy's shaken will and exhausted strength with a more courageous and resolute resistance, quickly promote the enemy's total collapse and final defeat, and complete our revolutionary mission. I will tell our comrades one more thing: if we currently harbor delusions of compromise and seek a lucky peace, it is tantamount to throwing ourselves into a trap and seeking our own destruction. It must be known that the so-called talk of adjusting diplomatic relations published by former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe on the 22nd of last month is actually a document of inducement to surrender, not a condition for peace. If we talk about peace based on this, to be honest, it is surrender. The Chinese nation has ambition, integrity, and a future. After a year and a half of resistance, although the sacrifices are great, our strength is becoming stronger as we fight. All descendants of the Yellow Emperor of the Chinese nation, in order to be worthy of our ancestors and parents, worthy of future generations, worthy of ourselves, and worthy of the countless martyrs who sacrificed for the War of Resistance, will never willingly surrender. Today, we can only fight with all our strength, resisting the war with a heart of certain death, until the day we achieve our goal. It must be known that surrendering is seeking death in life, with no hope of survival. Fighting is seeking life in death, and there is a way to certain victory. Now, I will again conduct a self-examination of our China's War of Resistance. I can say that not only does the enemy have a way to certain defeat, but our country has a reason to certain victory. Sun Tzu said, "First make yourself invincible, then wait for the enemy to be vulnerable." To achieve invincibility, of course, requires us to shed blood and sweat to work hard and struggle. However, from the aspects of history, geography, culture, economy, and national spirit, and based on past facts, we have, in our innate conditions, a foundation that makes the enemy inevitably invincible. As long as we combine it with our man-made efforts, we can certainly defeat the enemy without any doubt. (A) In terms of history, I have said that the demise of the Song and Ming dynasties was the defeat of a dynasty of a single family name, not the destruction of our Chinese nation. Our Chinese nation has never been conquered by anyone in five thousand years. Not only has it not been destroyed by anyone, but the collapse of the Song and Ming dynasties at that time was only due to a very small number of generals and officials who lacked courage and integrity, only knew personal security and ease, and were selfish and self-interested without regard for the nation's misfortune, resulting in the entire collapse of centuries of dynasty. However, that was an era of autocratic monarchy, and the court and the people were separated, so the pain was not very concerned, and the people's resistance could not be exerted for a while. In fact, the spirit of the entire nation at that time was not controlled by foreign tribes, and it always resisted foreign invaders to the end. After the national awakening became widespread, even after two or three hundred years, it was finally able to expel the barbarians and restore the rivers and mountains. What's more, now is the era of the Republic of China, which is based on the people. The current National Government is a revolutionary government, which is also the National Government. A revolutionary government must fight for the interests of the nation, and it also exists for the interests of the people. It recognizes its own responsibilities and cannot be threatened by others. It wants to complete the national revolution, implement the Three Principles of the People, and is absolutely not afraid of military aggression. Our War of Resistance today is a unified action in which the will, spirit, and strength of the government and the people are closely integrated. As Sun Tzu said, "The Way is to make the people agree with the ruler, so they can die with him, they can live with him, and the people are not afraid of danger." This is the first major principle of victory in war. Our war of resistance against Japan can indeed achieve this principle. Our whole country is of one heart, and everyone is united. Under the command of the National Government, the old, the weak, women, and children all know how to kill the enemy and defend themselves, and they all listen to the command and control. It is truly the so-called "dying without regret," and no one is willing to sell the lives of their ancestors to be a traitor. The so-called "can be killed but not humiliated" spirit of our country for thousands of years has been widely awakened by the enemy's bestiality. Therefore, in terms of history, China will never be destroyed. Looking at the past history, and measuring it with today's national consciousness and the spirit of the times, this war of resistance is even more impossible for China to be defeated and conquered.

(B) In terms of geography, our country has a natural position to defend against foreign aggression. The construction of the Great Wall in the past was a great project in which our people used the terrain as a defense against the enemy. Our country has a vast area, with a longitude spanning more than sixty-five degrees from east to west. From south to north, it has a climate of cold, temperate, and tropical zones. Therefore, our country's military success or failure is discussed in terms of both the timing of the heavens and the advantages of the earth, and both the inland and western lakes are vertical and horizontal, and mountains are staggered, plains and deserts, everything is available. Therefore, in terms of area, in the past, no matter which foreign tribe, they could only occupy a part of us for a period of time, but could not permanently occupy all of us. Even in the era when the Yuan and Qing forces were at their strongest, they could only occupy a few strongholds, and our people's resistance still existed and spread throughout the country. Today, the enemy only has a population of seventy million, and they want to swallow our country, which has a vast population more than six times larger than them, and they want to eliminate our nation, which has a long history. Isn't this a dream? As for the current war situation, our country has a complex terrain, as mentioned in the previous section. Coupled with the strong national spirit, and the enemy whose input and weapons are exhausted in use, then geographically speaking, our country will certainly not be conquered by the enemy.

(C) In terms of culture, since the beginning of history, only China in Asian countries has an independent culture, and only China has used culture to nurture foreign tribes, and even assimilated them. No foreign culture has been able to eliminate our country's inherent culture. As for modern science, it is a shared civilization result of the world. However, Chinese culture naturally has its unique spirit. There is no need to quote extensively, just look at the remote people in the mainland of our country now, countless men and women who encounter the enemy, often have loyal and righteous acts worthy of singing and weeping, which shows the deep foundation of the power of Chinese culture. If the enemy wants to eliminate our national spirit with a culture that is neither East nor West, they have already suffered a lot of failures in many occupied areas. As long as we are united and determined to fight, the longer the war of resistance, the more our national righteousness will be promoted, and during the war of resistance, we will forge a bright and practical force in our cultural history. Therefore, in terms of culture and national spirit, China will never be destroyed by the enemy.

(D) In terms of economy, the cause of war now often lies in economic plunder, and success or failure often depends on the ability of the economy to be sustained. Our country is an agricultural country and is in the process of construction. It was originally a worrying crisis when it was suddenly subjected to violent aggression. However, in the eighteen months from the beginning of the war to the present, not only has our financial foundation not been significantly affected, but our finance has always been stable, and the lives of the people in the rear have not been affected by the war. Moreover, most provinces have shown a surplus phenomenon due to last year's bumper harvest and consumption festivals. This is because we are an agricultural country and have strong endurance, unlike industrial countries, which are easily affected by war. Now that we have entered the second phase of the war of resistance, we firmly believe that there will be no problem with the wartime economy. In the southwestern and northwestern provinces, which are the base of our war of resistance, we are actively developing national defense industries, small and medium-sized industries, and mineral and forestry resources. The technical talents and capital of the whole country are concentrated to do it, which will definitely enable the national economic construction to establish a permanent foundation, and there is no need to worry about the lack of military and people's livelihood. The tenacity of the wartime economic endurance of our agricultural country is another point that the enemy has not considered, and it is also one of the enemy's biggest failures. Therefore, in terms of economy, China is sufficient to resist the war for a long time and will not be subdued by the enemy.

Modern warfare not only requires knowing the enemy and yourself, but also knowing the direction of international situation development. The enemy not only does not know himself, does not know the enemy, and simply does not know us Chinese, so the era environment must inevitably tend to failure step by step. In the past year, the international situation, in general, although the surface is turbulent and uneasy, the latent mainstream is always moving in the direction of maintaining faith and peace. Especially the democratic powers in Europe and the United States are very careful in dealing with the changing situation. On the part of the people, rejecting aggression and advocating justice are becoming more and more powerful every day. Even their politicians are painstakingly trying to stabilize the existing situation while also never relaxing the preparation for enriching their own strength. From various aspects, we can see that they have the determination to curb aggression and maintain world peace. Recently, this situation has become more and more obvious. Since the September 18th Incident, we have long determined that the only path in the world is the path of public reason and justice, which is the path that all mankind should follow. All countries that can be self-reliant and self-reliant, even if they are temporarily in hardship and sacrifice, are justified. Over time, they will naturally get the resonance of justice. The recent signs of international evolution corroborate our observations over the past six or seven years, and there is no error at all. This is not because we have any ability to foresee, we just adhere to the position of Mr. Sun Yat-Sen of saving the country. Therefore, everything is based on conscience and justice. Comrades must understand that Mr. Sun Yat-Sen spent his entire life in revolution to save China, which is also to save the world. Our unyielding national policy of resisting the war is to follow this practical teaching, which is what revolutionary believers of the Three Principles of the People should unanimously and resolutely adhere to. Mr. Sun Yat-Sen once said that after China restores its national status, it will also bear a great responsibility to the world. In his nationalism and various teachings, Mr. Sun Yat-Sen also repeatedly instructed that China is the pillar of East Asia, and the great nation of Asia. When China is strong, the surrounding nations are peaceful and sincerely return to us, and the nations surrounding our country can maintain independence and live in harmony. Mr. Sun Yat-Sen further pointed out from historical facts, "We have never used economic power to oppress other nations... China's peaceful thought was already very sufficient in the Han Dynasty." We do not insult the lonely and weak, we are not afraid of the strong, we talk about mutual assistance, we seek self-reliance, we advocate faith, and we oppose aggression. Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-Sen said, "China has been strong for thousands of years, and Korea still exists. Japan has only been strong for twenty years, and it has destroyed Korea." This is because China has always taken helping the weak and supporting the declining as its policy, and self-preservation and coexistence as its ultimate goal. Our national revolution is to promote our morality of faith and peace, and to promote the common and permanent peace and happiness of the world.

At the time when the European war ended, Mr. Sun Yat-Sen drafted a plan for national construction, the purpose of which was to promote the modernization of China's industry, and also to find an excellent outlet for capital and technology, so as to prevent the world from suffering the tragic wars due to the competition for resources and markets. The most important sentence in the middle is to use the principle of "survival by controlling ourselves" to use foreign capital and machinery. Unfortunately, this compassionate idea of saving the country and the world has not been concretely realized. On the contrary, Japan took advantage of the opportunity after the European War to invade our country step by step. Since the September 18th Incident, our country has always been wronged and endured pain, respecting peace, and the enemy continues to expand its aggression without limit. He does not know at all that now is the era of "national self-determination" and the surging tide of "nationalism." Small nations still demand to rise and independence, and the world powers have also changed their past attitudes and methods. In such an era, our enemy still delusionally wants to swallow China with a country of 70 million people and 450 million people. After the Tanggu Agreement, the establishment and survival of our country has reached the lowest limit. At this point, Japan still wants to destroy the only lifeline for China's life, and provoke trouble for no reason, occupying our Beijing and Tianjin. Even this lowest limit is not allowed to be preserved, then it is better to die than to live, and better to perish than to exist. To exist together is to perish, so we can only fight desperately. The ancient saying says, "When two armies meet, the mourner wins." At that time, there was no reason for us not to resist. Our morale and people's hearts were completely sad and indignant, with death and nothing else. This is an "army of mourning" that has never existed in the history of the world, and our war of resistance is not only to defend the independence and survival of our country, but also to maintain world peace and international faith. Therefore, this battle of ours is also a fair and just "righteous battle," and the enemy's unprovoked aggression against China is a "violent battle" of suicide and self-mutilation that has no name.

When we started the war of resistance, we had already calculated all the hardships and difficulties of today, and even the hardships and difficulties that would be deepened ten times or a hundred times compared to today. However, since this sacred duty has been added to the shoulders of our nation, we must overcome all difficulties and achieve the task of our national revolution with supreme sacrifice. We must attack aggression, restore the effectiveness of international articles, extend international justice, and use our resolute resistance to prove the inevitable defeat of the tyranny of violence, change the vision and hearing of the entire human race in the world, and permanently maintain international peace. Comrades must know that before the war of resistance, the world regarded our country as inferior to a third-class country. Now we are fighting with Japan, a first-class power, for more than a year and a half, and we have not been defeated by the enemy. We certainly no longer need to fear the enemy's violence. Our future is still inevitably full of difficulties, but after the war of resistance has entered the second stage, we are convinced that the war situation will inevitably be smooth day by day, and closer and closer to the light. The question is whether we have the spirit of unyielding, long-term persistence, and whether we have the effort to unite the country and fight more and more vigorously.

Based on the above description, all comrades can truly recognize the strength of our country to support the struggle, recognize the strategic policies of the enemy country, and recognize the various actual situations and the process of evolution in other aspects. From this, you can understand the inevitability of the development of all things in the world, and you can clearly understand the number of successes and failures. Since ancient times, great courage comes from great wisdom. Since we have such an unshakeable righteous perception of the mission and future of the war of resistance, we will naturally generate incomparable determination and confidence. Now our war of resistance has already entered the second stage. Undeniably, we have lost a lot of land and most of the transportation money, sacrificed the lives and property of many compatriots, and seized countless industries and resources. However, we must know that most revolutionary work starts from scratch. From now on, we must use the existing land, manpower, military power, and financial resources as a plan, and restore the spirit of the revolutionary martyrs before the Tongmenghui who raised the banner of uprising against foreign rule without an inch of iron in their hands and without any credentials. From small places, low places, and extremely difficult places, we must be down-to-earth and set a specific action plan and plan. After the plan is set, we must do our best to do it, and every word and sentence must be implemented. The enemy declares that "the war will be a hundred years." We believe that the work of resisting the war and building the country has no time limit. If it does not succeed in five years, then it will be ten years, and if it does not succeed in ten years, then it will be a hundred years. We will not stop for a day until the goal is achieved. How should we work hard? We must work hard to target the enemy's situation. Today's enemy is just like what Sun Tzu said, "The great officials are angry and do not obey, they are afraid of the enemy and fight on their own, and the general does not know his ability, which is called collapse." When we know this, we must use our unity to deal with the enemy's arrogance and chaos, and the defeat of the following. We know that during the war, the enemy's industry is stagnant, and the economic flaws are becoming more and more obvious. We must give play to the characteristics of our agricultural country, endure hardship, and support ourselves to deepen the weaknesses of the enemy's industrial country. We know that the enemy's desire is to fundamentally destroy the economic foundation of our nation. We must step up the construction of all our wartime, and cultivate the power of long-term resistance, so as to promote the crisis of the collapse of the enemy's society. We know that since last year, the enemy country has suffered from natural disasters, wind disasters, floods, and continuous major earthquakes, which have caused the people who were forced to fight in the country to suffer more pain and loss. We should take advantage of our favorable weather and geographical advantages to step up agricultural production to fight against the shortcomings of the island country that cannot end natural disasters. We know that the enemy people are suffering more and more, the enemy government is ineffective, and his opposition to the war between the government and the public is becoming stronger day by day. We must truly practice our Three Principles of the People to attack the enemy's militarism that harms the people and harms people's own self. In short, we today

Editorial

### Generalissimo Chiang's Admonition and the People

Generalissimo Chiang recently attended the opening of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and delivered an admonitory speech. The full text was published in the newspapers yesterday and today. It embodies utmost sincerity and fervent emotion, expounds profound and subtle principles, analyzes reality, and points the way forward. It promotes the righteous spirit of resisting tyranny and is filled with the vital energy of the nation. Truly, literature conveys the Way; the Way of China's resistance and nation-building is contained within it. It is a document that will be passed down through the ages and a model for the nation to emulate. Comparing it to Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma's inaugural declaration and parliamentary address, in terms of sincerity and falsehood, reality and emptiness, right and wrong, truth and doubt, strength and weakness, courage and cowardice, wisdom and foolishness, greatness and pettiness, resourcefulness and incompetence, in any aspect, it is clear that China is superior to Japan. It is clear that China has a leader and culture, while Japan has no statesman and no soul. This is a clear sign that China will surely win and Japan will surely lose. Generalissimo Chiang's words are spoken from the position of a commander-in-chief entrusted with the nation's safety. Opening the door to clearly defined responsibility, it will not only be believed and obeyed by those within and without, but also serve as a guiding principle for the thoughts, words, and actions of China's military, civilians, party, and government personnel.

China's military, political, and party affairs are guided and orchestrated by a brilliant and wise leader at the top. The people are happy to exert their utmost efforts, responding to the times and offering suggestions based on events, which goes without saying. Considering the people's perspective: encountering such difficulties, with such a bright and promising future, how can the people contribute to the resistance and nation-building? How can they live up to the leader's earnest teachings? And how can they not be ashamed to be the people of this time of resistance and nation-building, not be ashamed to be the people led by a brilliant and wise leader? Today is a great era, continuing the past and opening up the future. How should the Chinese people of today contribute to their nation, so that future generations, thousands of years from now, will proudly say that their ancestors had a loyal and patriotic heart in the glorious and brilliant history of the revival?

Since the nation is in a time of extraordinary hardship, the people should bear extraordinary responsibilities. This is certainly true. Examining the reality and distinguishing its nature, it is also extremely ordinary. Because it is ordinary, it is what everyone should do and what everyone can overcome. Some may feel that their abilities are not enough to fulfill the ordinary, or lament that the war has deprived them of their ordinary abilities. Can this be believed? It is either thoughtlessness or deception. Let us examine the general phenomena of the nineteen months of resistance: those who have suffered the calamity of burning, killing, raping, and looting, and have experienced the hardships of displacement, are most deserving of sympathy. The old have lost their children, the young have lost their guardians, their homes have been destroyed, and they are suffering from hunger and cold. If these people are not given relief, they will fill the ditches. The responsibility for relief lies with society and the government. According to a recent estimate report from a missionary, there are nearly thirty million people in need of relief. This is indeed a huge number, but compared to the total population of the country, it is only six or seven percent. If six or seven percent are in need of relief and one percent are risking their lives on the battlefield, there are still ninety-two or three percent of the people who should bear ordinary responsibilities in this extraordinary time. If they exert their utmost efforts, what cannot be accomplished? What success cannot be achieved?

What are the people's responsibilities in this extraordinary time? In terms of daily personal life, there are only two things: minimizing consumption and diligently increasing production. This is what the nation's strength depends on. Minimizing consumption and increasing production are the ways to strengthen the foundation. In terms of general social life, the key is sincerity and love, reflecting on oneself as a member of the public, not being a burden to the public, and fulfilling one's duties as a member. Serve the public, serve those who are less capable than oneself in intellect, wealth, or physical strength. In cities and towns, there are needs and deficiencies. In rural areas, there are needs and deficiencies. Observe the needs and deficiencies, do not be stingy with what is private, and do your best every day, exerting your utmost effort and not being tired of the small things. In terms of the nation, fulfill your obligations by serving in the military, paying taxes, and not evading, shirking, or being opportunistic. Respond to donation drives with spare capacity and support public bond issues with assets, all according to one's ability. All of this may sound like commonplace talk, but is it not extremely ordinary to do? The invading country mobilizes its troops, but many do not know what they are fighting for, or they know that they are fighting for the fame and wealth of warlords and financial groups. However, the troops who rampage through China and die in foreign lands are indeed obtained through conscription. Regardless of wealth, poverty, nobility, or lowliness, names are registered in the military, and orders are executed immediately. The strictness of their military service is like this. This year's budget reaches one million yuan. Divided by the total population of their main island and territories, including the elderly, children, laborers, and even vagrants and beggars, every person, regardless of gender, poverty, or wealth, must pay hundreds of yuan for the costs of the invading military and government. The burden is so heavy. Compared to the Chinese people, who are fighting for survival, freedom, and happiness, for the country, for their ancestors, and for their descendants, even if there are ninety-two or three percent of them, they are still better than the Japanese. Why not! Because of this, should they not each uphold their conscience and abilities to fulfill their ordinary responsibilities? With a brilliant and wise leader at the top and a people who each fulfill their responsibilities below, victory in the resistance is certain, and nation-building will succeed. It is only a matter of time, and it is not far off.

The crucial task is to overcome material things with spirit, to compensate for shortages with diligence and frugality, to make up for past delays with redoubled efforts, and to make up for our lack of weapons and modern military equipment with a determination to sacrifice and a confidence in victory. Comrades, we must further recognize the Party's responsibility to the nation and the Party members' responsibility to the revolution. In the midst of the intense resistance, such a gathering is not an easy thing. We must make this plenary session set a definite, concrete, and thorough policy and plan for the second phase of the resistance. We ourselves must also establish before the portrait of the late Sun Yat-sen our own vows to be responsible, to fulfill our duties, and to fight to the end, to implement the Party's resolutions, to respect the Party's discipline, to consolidate the Party's foundations, and to exhaust the Party's mission. We do not need to pay attention to how many branches or difficulties there are in the period of resistance. We should always ask ourselves whether we have fulfilled our responsibilities. There is no self-reliant revolutionary party in the world that cannot lead the revolution to success, and there is no nation with a long history, vast territory, large population, and deep foundation that cannot achieve complete independence, equality, and freedom. Comrades, please remember that "knowing is difficult, doing is easy" is our motto, and "self-reliance" is our watchword. As long as we can do, can do well, can do quickly, can do hard, can do diligently, and can do practically, there is no reason for failure. Today, with the most fervent and sincere spirit, I hope for the success of this plenary session and wish for the success of our great cause of resistance, nation-building, and revolution.

(Chongqing) Kuomintang personnel recently commented on Generalissimo Chiang's speech at the Fifth Plenary Session, saying that it can be seen from Chiang's speech that all parties and factions are becoming more united, and continuing the resistance has become a matter of course. Chiang's current determination to resist is ten times stronger than eight months ago. This can be proven by the strengthening of military forces and political institutions. Since Wang Jingwei's departure, none of the leaders in Chongqing have paid attention to Japan's gestures of seeking peace. (26th Associated Press Telegram)

### The Situation in the Guangdong War Zone is Tense Again; the Japanese Army's Plot to Land Becomes More Obvious; Bai Chongxi Plans to Go to Guangdong This Week to Coordinate Military Affairs with Zhang Fakui.

(Hong Kong) The Japanese army has formed three marine corps in Yokosuka, plotting to land in Guangdong and Guangxi. The conspiracy is becoming more obvious, and the situation in the Guangdong war zone is tense again. Therefore, Bai Chongxi plans to go to Guangdong this week to coordinate military affairs with Zhang Fakui to eliminate the Japanese invaders and defend the homeland. The Guangdong guerrilla conference is scheduled to be held on January 1st in a certain place in northern Guangdong. (26th Special Telegram)

(Hong Kong) According to reports, the Japanese army west of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway has retreated south from Tanbu to Wuhe Market. (26th Telegram)

(Hong Kong) According to news received here this morning, yesterday evening, three Japanese motorboats carrying dozens of soldiers attempted to land near Beihai but were repelled by the Chinese army. (26th Express News Agency Telegram)

(Chongqing) According to news received here, the Japanese army in the northern Guangdong province is now continuing to retreat south along the Guangzhou-Huaxian Highway and the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway. The vanguard of the Chinese army's counterattack has reached Shiling and Juntian, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. There are no major changes in the Xijiang and Dongjiang areas. The Japanese side is constantly reinforcing Sanshui Southwest and Dongguan Shitan to prevent the Chinese army's counterattack. (26th Express News Agency Telegram)

Sihui: The Japanese army in the Sanshui area has increased by more than 2,000 in the past two days, including more than 400 engineers and more than 100 cavalrymen, heading to the southwest. In addition, there are more than 200 people wearing gray uniforms, claiming to be a "mopping-up team," and are dispatched to various villages to carry out harassment. (25th Telegram)

Sihui: Starting on the 20th, the Japanese army has been transporting military supplies and food stored in the southwest to Sanshui one after another. On the morning of the 21st, more than 20 Japanese military vehicles and armored vehicles, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, departed from Hekou to Foshan. (23rd Telegram)

Guilin: In the past two days, the 24th and 25th, the Japanese army in the Sanshui area increased by more than 3,000, mostly transported by Guangzhou-Sanshui railway, stationed in the city of Sanshui and the Hekou Southwest area. A unit of more than 100 arrived at Zhennan New Market on the morning of the 25th, seemingly intending to invade the west. (26th Telegram)

### Japan's Political Strategy Toward China is Ultimately Heading Toward Failure.

(Chongqing) Today, Chinese political figures commented on Wu Peifu's meeting with puppet government officials and the telegram from the puppet organization in Beiping to Kuomintang leaders, in which Generalissimo Chiang's name was not mentioned. They said that Japan's political strategy toward China is ultimately heading toward failure. Japan's attempt to lure Chongqing officials into its embrace is a dream. The spokesman told an Associated Press reporter, "Do you think Chairman Lin and Sun Ke will betray Generalissimo Chiang?" He said that this proves that Japan has no understanding of the situation in China. Ariita's speech in the Diet even attempted to alienate democratic countries and separate the United Kingdom and the United States from France and the Soviet Union. These two things are extremely foolish. This time, the telegram from the puppet organization in Beiping did not attack Generalissimo Chiang and the Kuomintang, which shows that the Japanese side intends to seek peace, and its attitude towards Generalissimo Chiang has already changed.

### The United States Has Actually Begun an Undeclared War Against Japan; The British-American Compromise on Loans to China Results in Arida Expressing His Determination to Abolish the Nine-Power Treaty.

(Washington) Democratic Senator Lenroot said to the Senate today that since the United States has loaned China $25 million, the United States has actually begun an "undeclared war" against Japan. According to Lenroot, the success of the United States' decision to loan money to China is due to the result of discussions between the United Kingdom and the United States. After Eden's visit to the United States, it was completely completed. According to Lenroot's opinion, the United States' policy is now being controlled by the United Kingdom. Lenroot also advocated that the United Kingdom and France should now cede some islands in the West Indies in the Atlantic to the United States as compensation for war debts, and at the same time increase the United States' bases at sea. (26th United Press Telegram)

(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arida replied to questions in the House of Representatives this morning, saying that Japan will recognize the new China "when China forms a unified central government." He then mentioned the Nine-Power Treaty, saying that the treaty can no longer meet the new situation in the Far East. However, the Foreign Minister did not want to state whether the Japanese government will abolish the treaty. The Foreign Minister also replied to a certain member's question that the Soviet Union's expansion of aid to the Chiang Kai-shek government will lead to a second world war, saying that since the China Incident occurred, Japan has been closely monitoring the Soviet Union's aid to the Chiang government and has never slackened. Even if the Western powers do not recognize the new situation in East Asia, the Japanese government intends to strive to make them understand it correctly, but it will never change its established policy. A certain member asked how long it would take to establish a new order in East Asia. Prime Minister Hiranuma replied that this is difficult to predict. However, Japan must be prepared to understand that the establishment of a new order in East Asia will require a long period of time. The Prime Minister also stated that the provisions of the National Mobilization Law will be implemented one by one. A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance declared that the government intends to adhere to its foreign exchange policy and maintain the current exchange rate of the yen, which is one shilling and two pence per yen. Member Baron Asada asked about the joint defense of the Comintern by Japan, "Manchukuo," and China, and the strengthening of the anti-Comintern agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy. The Prime Minister replied that Japan must lead in the joint defense of the Comintern with "Manchukuo" and China. Therefore, the Japanese government has a policy of stationing troops in important locations. As for how the three countries' anti-Comintern agreement will be strengthened, it is not yet at a stage where it can be announced. Asada then strongly advocated expanding the agreement and forming a defensive alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy. (26th Reuters Telegram)

### The Japanese Budget Committee Unfolds a Questioning Battle; The Government Only Makes Side Replies to Avoid Exposing Economic Weaknesses.

(Hong Kong) Tokyo Electric Power Company: The questions in the Budget Committee of the Japanese Parliament are more important than those at the general meeting, because all secret or detailed discussions are conducted in the Budget Committee. The Budget Committee is neither completely open nor completely secret, so the records of proceedings published in newspapers are limited to the parts that can be made public. The Japanese House of Representatives held another Budget Committee meeting on the 25th. First, Takebe, a member of the Seiyukai, first questioned why the government has vigorously expanded industries such as fertilizer production, gold, rayon, and coal liquefaction, but there are still no achievements to speak of. Minister of Commerce and Industry Hatta replied that the reasons are very complicated and that he is working to promote them and that there will be progress in the future. It can be seen from this that the important industries that Japan has tried to develop in the past year have no achievements to speak of. Takeuchi, director of the Fuel Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, supplemented Hatta's reply, saying that liquid fuel made from coal is scheduled to be sold by the end of this year. Takebe then asked what countermeasures the government has against rising prices, anxiety in life, and malignant inflation. Hatta only replied that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Price Control Committee are actively working on it, and fortunately, the prices of daily necessities have not changed much. It can also be seen from this that the Japanese people feel extremely uneasy about rising prices and are extremely terrified of the trend of inflation. Takebe further questioned that the government bonds held by the Bank of Japan have not been sold out, so will it be more difficult to digest government bonds in the future? Ishiwata replied that the banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan are now 350 million yen less than last year. The bank did not sell out all government bonds in order to avoid unnecessary inflation. Ishiwata's words were very cunning, and in order to avoid exposing its economic weaknesses, he only made side replies. Takebe, a member of the Seiyukai, then questioned the government about what plans it has for a debt reduction fund. Ishiwata replied that there are no concrete plans yet, but the government is very concerned about this. It can be seen from this how difficult the enemy's finances are. There is only an increase in government bonds and no way to reduce them. Takebe also asked what active plans the government has for economic control and long-term construction. Hatta replied that material control and economic control will be strengthened every day, so the difficulties of small and medium-sized business owners and the lack of materials will inevitably worsen. It can be seen from this that the enemy's peaceful industries will accelerate their collapse in the future, and the unemployment problem will also become more serious. Takebe also raised an important question, saying what is the government's outlook on the economic world. Ishiwata replied that foreigners' predictions about Japan's economic strength are completely wrong. In addition to engaging in long-term warfare, the government is still promoting a plan to expand production capacity as usual. Ishiwata avoided talking about the pessimistic facts. Takebe refused to let go and asked what guarantees the government has for the long-term construction's financial war expenses, which are even more important. Ishiwata finally revealed some of the truth, saying that the digestion of government bonds and the funds for long-term construction are indeed difficult, but the government is trying its best to encourage savings in order to avoid malignant inflation. At this point, the short-range questioning battle came to an end. Overall, Ishiwata and Hatta's replies fully demonstrate that the enemy's finances and economy have reached the end of their rope.

### Lions and Tigers in Japanese Zoos Also Participate in Wartime Frugality Movement; Carnivores Taste Fish for the First Time.

(Tokyo) Two lions in the Tokyo Zoo are also participating in the national wartime frugality movement, abandoning horse meat and feeding them rabbit meat and fish. The two lions have two meals a day, and have been replacing horse meat with rabbit meat for several months, but they have only recently started eating three raw mackerel for dinner. According to the keepers, the two lions did not eat the fish for the first few days, but now the two lions are eating the fish with relish. After this change, the zoo can save more than two yen per lion per day, and will try to feed the zoo's leopards, tigers, and other carnivores with fish. According to the director of the Tokyo Zoo, during the World War, European zoos strictly prohibited the animals in the zoo from becoming pregnant in order to save food, but feeding carnivores with fish may be a world first.

### Japanese Minister of the Army Explains Military Equipment Plan; Standard for Dealing with China and Russia.

(Hong Kong) Tokyo News: The House of Representatives held a budget debate this afternoon. Dike Kangjiro, a member of the House of People's Representatives, asked that former Minister of the Army Tojo Hideki gave a speech to the military arms merchants' meeting on November 28 last year, advocating that Japan's military expansion plan should be based on a head-on conflict with the Soviet Union and China at the same time. What is the Minister of the Army's opinion on this matter? Minister of the Army Itagaki replied that each country's military equipment plan has its established standards. Taking the Soviet Union as an example, its military equipment plan is based on fighting on both the eastern and western battlefields at the same time. Itagaki then clarified Tojo's statement, saying that Japan is now concentrating its national resources to achieve the final goal of the China Incident, but preparing to work with China and the Soviet Union at the same time and achieving the goal of the China Incident are closely related. In other words, Japan must be prepared to continue to advance according to the current established policy, etc. Dike Kangjiro expressed his approval of the section described by the Minister of the Army, saying that the current international situation is such that it allows the Soviet Union to connect with the soil of North China and Mongolia, and its attitude is the same as that of others. The theory of two strong standards is necessary. Itagaki said that if the Soviet Union does not provoke Japan, then Japan has no intention of attacking it, but Japan is prepared to deal with the Soviet Union's aggression. (25th Telegram)

### German Army Officer Praises the Red Army; Says the Battle of Zhanggufeng Last Summer Proved its Strong Combat Power.

(Berlin) The official organ of the National Socialist Party here, "The Front," published an article by Captain Chisga of the German Army General Staff, praising the Soviet Red Army: "Although the Red Army has lost its significant power due to the removal of many senior officers, it is a mistake to ignore its gradual expansion. This expansion has of course increased its offensive strength. The bravery and perseverance of Russian soldiers in the World War and the Battle of Zhanggufeng last summer, and their knowledge of how to fight brilliantly under good leaders, is a clear and undeniable fact."

### China is Bound to Win the War of Resistance Against Japan; British and American People Share the Same View.

(London) The Times correspondent in China, Fleming, recently gave a speech at the Royal Joint Association on the war between China and Japan, saying: "Most observers believe that after the fall of Nanjing, Japan failed to negotiate peace with the National Government, or to force the Chinese government to accept peace conditions, and has in fact failed. Japan's expansion movement, which has been going on for many years, seems to have achieved something, but in terms of the final goal, it is not considered particularly satisfactory. In the past, Chinese soldiers were despised and often ridiculed. Today, although the country does not have well-trained staff officers, it has been able to resist a strong enemy with unprecedented unity and become a good soldier. The Chinese guerrillas are extremely active and are a thorn in Japan's side. It may be difficult to get rid of them in a few years. When I was in China, I witnessed Japanese planes bombing many times, but I never saw them hit a target." (25th Havas Telegram)

(Paris) Lei, secretary-general of the Pacific Problems Research Association, recently returned from a tour of the United States and gave a speech to the press on his impressions of this trip: "Regarding the war between China and Japan, American public opinion generally believes that Japan will definitely not win and China will definitely not fail. As for the United States' Far East policy, its tendency is becoming more and more obvious. The country's government recently loaned China a huge sum of 25 million US dollars, and its ambassador to China, Johnson, returned to the country via the newly built Myanmar Road, which shows the increasingly active attitude towards the Far East situation."

Zaragoza – According to witnesses of the Nationalist forces entering Barcelona, the Nationalist troops seemed to regard themselves as Crusaders, as they carried crosses in front of their troops.

The customs of Catholicism have been deeply ingrained for centuries, and these soldiers have long been influenced by them. They believe this campaign is a righteous act, and having captured Barcelona, they cannot help but become arrogant, believing that they can compare with the achievements of the Crusaders.

### German-Polish Celebration: Foreign Minister Beckertside

Warsaw – Polish Foreign Minister Beckert and his wife hosted a banquet for the German Foreign Minister and his wife last night. During the banquet, Mr. Beck gave the following welcoming address: "Our country's government is honored that the Foreign Minister of our friendly country, Germany, and his wife have come to our country. This visit also coincides with the eve of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the German-Polish Peace Declaration in 1934, which makes this visit even more significant. The German-Polish Treaty of January 26, 1934, is one of the shortest treaties in the world to date, but its few words have expressed the courage, vision, and determination of Chancellor Hitler and General Piłsudski, and have become a historically significant achievement. We only need to review the successes and failures of European policies over the past five years to prove the value of this agreement. Since the heads of state of the two countries concluded this brief formula with the greatest determination, no major disturbances or tensions in the European political situation have been able to shake its solid foundation. Based on past experience, I hope to have the following gains in the future: (1) To continue the previous trend, to concentrate the energies of the two countries, and to strive for the creative work needed by the two countries and Europe; (2) To determine the starting point of good neighborliness, from today onwards, to enable the children of the two countries to grow up in a spirit of friendly relations and mutual understanding; (3) According to the correct principles of the two governments, any problems between the two countries can be resolved in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding of the interests of both countries. It is in this spirit that I raise my glass to wish for the prosperity of your country and the health of your head of state, Hitler."

After the Polish Foreign Minister finished his speech, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop stood up to give a reply, first expressing his deep gratitude for the grand welcome, and then saying, "I am very happy to reciprocate your country's visit. The generous welcome of your government to my wife and I proves your country's traditional hospitality. It is gratifying that my coming here coincides with the fifth anniversary of the signing of the 1934 agreement between our two countries. Five years of experience have proved that the path decided by the two heads of state, Piłsudski and Hitler, has determined the future policy of the two countries. The German government and people are eager for German-Polish relations to become stronger based on this agreement. The vision and determination of the two governments in signing the agreement have guaranteed that the two countries will solve all future problems with mutual respect and understanding."

### Northwest Relations Extremely Important: Chinese Army Must Defend Firmly, Many Divisions of Troops Stationed Along the Yellow River, Japanese Army's Rear Is Harassed, Unable to Cross the River

(Chongqing) – Chiang Ting-wen, Chairman of Shaanxi Province, met with an Associated Press reporter and made the following statement regarding the Japanese army's attempt to invade the Northwest: "The Chinese military strategy is to keep the Japanese army in Shanxi extremely busy, so that they have no time to cross the Yellow River and advance towards Xi'an. Up to now, although one or two thousand Japanese troops have attempted to cross the river four times at Yumen Ferry, north of Tongguan, it has not yet reached a serious stage, and the Japanese army has not attempted to cross the river at Yan'guan. Northwest relations are extremely important, so we will defend it at any cost. The surrounding high mountains are natural barriers, full of traps, artillery, and infantry networks. We have many divisions of Chinese troops stationed on the banks of the Yellow River, and there are also many divisions of Chinese troops with adequate firepower and complete equipment stationed west of Luoyang. We are more concerned about the Shanxi side of the Yellow River. The guerrillas in that area have not yet been defeated, and the Japanese army's rear is being harassed, so they have not been able to cross the Yellow River. The Japanese side's heavy vehicles and artillery have not yet been able to cross the ice that has formed on the river. Even if they cross, the ice will melt in the spring, and transportation will be extremely difficult to maintain. If the Japanese side wants to occupy the Northwest, they must occupy Lanzhou. There are three routes to attack Lanzhou. The first route is from Baotou through Wuyuan to Ningxia, but this route has deserts, hailstorms, and no water, grass, or food. Mechanized units are useless, and the Hui army will make extremely strong resistance. The second route is from the Longhai Railway directly to southwestern Henan and then to Tongguan, but Chinese guerrillas are extremely active in the mountains along the route, so the Japanese army must sacrifice thousands of lives if they want to attack along this route. The third route is to cross the Yellow River from Yumen and Hejin, but due to the activities of the Chinese guerrillas in Shanxi, the Japanese army dare not cross the river. All river crossings are currently controlled by the government, so the transportation of the guerrillas is still smooth and unimpeded. At present, the Chinese people in the war zone are not being evacuated, but are being persuaded to stay in the local area and given training, because they are supporters of the guerrillas, providing the guerrillas with food, clothing, shelter, and propaganda. There is currently no difficulty in conscription, and more Chinese troops are currently being trained." (Associated Press Telegram, 26th)

Tongguan: (1) The Japanese troops who advanced on the Chinese army's Huangyaoling, Heicaoping, Majialing, and Moling line, more than thirty li long, on the third, were the Xunkiri Brigade of the 20th Division, with more than 30 artillery pieces and 8 aircraft, totaling more than 4,000 people. After a bloody battle by the Chinese for one day, the Japanese army suffered 600-700 casualties. More than 1,000 Japanese troops in front of Huangyaoling and Heicaoping were defeated by the Chinese army in the evening and fled towards Xiejian. The Qian on Majialing and Moling are still fighting.

### Sino-Foreign Charity Basketball First Game, Mixed Team Wins First Game Against Mackay & Ling

The Opening Throw Becomes a Problem, Overtime Game, Final Score 28 to 20

The first game of the Sino-Foreign Charity Basketball Tournament, sponsored by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, between the Mixed Team and Mackay & Ling, opened at the China Youth Basketball Hall at 8:00 last night. In an extremely tense situation, the Mixed Team finally broke through the dull situation in the last eight minutes and won with a score of 21 to 19. However, due to Mackay & Ling's protest, the game was extended for five minutes, and the situation changed abruptly. The Mixed Team was unstoppable and won with a score of 28 to 20. The score was tied at 10 points each in the first half. The audience was charitable, and the stadium was declared full, with an estimated 600 guests. The Mixed Team brought together the elites from the Paramount, Hualian, and Guoguang, while Mackay & Ling was a combination of the Red and Gold teams. The strength of both sides was evenly matched, not wanting a rerun of the Shanghai Shenbao Cup Sino-American Charity Tournament. However, Mackay & Ling lacked the strong player Haize, and their strength was inferior to the American team. The victory of the Mixed Team was indeed the expected result. The second game is scheduled to be held at the same venue at 8:00 PM on February 2nd, and the victory of the Mixed Team is hopeful.

Worth Celebrating

Last night's game was dull and deadlocked until the last eight minutes, when it was broken. Although the Mixed Team changed its lineup repeatedly, it was always difficult to achieve the ideal level of cooperation. The performance was particularly flustered, and the shooting was also inaccurate. The situation was almost entirely under the control of Mackay & Ling, and the scores were repeatedly tied, with a difference of only one or two points. The Mixed Team was frustrated, while Mackay & Ling's offensive was fierce and relentless. Fortunately, Mackay & Ling was not used to the vast field of China Youth, and dozens of shooting opportunities were missed. Having practiced in the small field of West Youth, the shots were too close, and the effort was slightly lacking. Otherwise, the Mixed Team would have been defeated long ago. The sudden change in the last game was also unexpected and gratifying. In the second game, the Mixed Team will definitely be able to go to the next level. Sun Huipei should be promoted for individual performance.

Temporary Agreement

After Mr. Xi Yushu gave a report in Chinese and English, thanking all parties, Mr. Yuan Ludeng threw the opening ball on behalf of Mr. Yu Qiaqing. Mr. Yu was slightly ill and planned to be at the ceremony. The elderly man threw the first ball, which was obtained by Zhou Dayun and quickly passed to Chen Xuechong, who turned around and sent it into the basket. Then, during the break, Mackay & Ling protested, saying that the Mixed Team got Mr. Yuan's pass to open the game. Therefore, the sides agreed that if the result differed by two points, the game would be extended for five minutes to determine the winner. Coincidentally, the result was 21 to 19, with the Mixed Team scoring two more points. Therefore, the game was extended for five minutes. The Mixed Team took advantage of the momentum and scored seven points in a row, finally winning with a score of 28 to 20.

Deadlock

Under the command of Mr. Shen Kunnian, the first lineup of the Mixed Team started with Zhou Dayun, Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Sun Huipei, and Cai Yanxiong. Mackay & Ling, on the other hand, was the Mackay & Ling Red team. After Chen Xuechong scored the first point, Cai Yanxiong's half-court long shot was greatly appreciated by the audience. Zhou Dayun followed up with a contribution, and Cai also made a free throw. In this way, the Mixed Team suddenly took a great advantage with a score of 7 to 0. Mackay & Ling remained calm and composed and immediately scored four points with free throws and shots. Xiang Long hurriedly replaced Li Zhenzhong, but could not contain the momentum of Mackay & Ling. Sakin late sent Mandell to exceed with 8 to 7, and the situation of the Mixed Team was very bad. The cooperation was awkward, and the situation was entirely under the bombardment of Mackay & Ling. Davun made a free throw to make it 8 each. Moore scored again to make it 10 to 8. At this time, Mackay & Ling sent the whole team to the court, and both sides made very few points, and the first half ended in a tie at 10.

Spring Clouds Unfold

In the second half, Kong Guangyi replaced Zhou Dayun, and Mackay & Ling remained the whole team, and a tug-of-war began again. Mackay & Ling missed opportunities repeatedly, and the Mixed Team hurriedly replaced Kong Guangyi with Li Zhenzhong. Sure enough, the situation was invigorated, and Xiang Long's move took the lead with 14 to 13. The Mackay & Ling Red team sent the whole team to the court again, and Davun also replaced Xiang Long. The battle suddenly unfolded like spring clouds, and Cai, Li, and Xuechong joined forces to make contributions, creating an advantage of 20 to 15 and 21 to 17. Unexpectedly, Sakin threw one shot, making it 21 to 19, and the game was extended for five minutes. In these last five minutes, the Mixed Team gave Mackay & Ling a chance to do nothing. Big Cat made the first free throw, and Yanxiong made a half-court shot. The two scored two more points each, while Mackay & Ling only scored one of two free throws by Brent.

### Finance: Tianjin Banks Repeatedly Buy, Gold Prices Continue to Advance to High Peaks

—Arrived at 2,037 Yuan Yesterday—

Yesterday's spot gold market situation was still chaotic, generally rising and then falling, and finally rising again, depending on the amount of supply and demand from both sides and the tightness of foreign exchange. Initially, due to the lingering effects of the previous day and the fact that the foreign exchange was heavily purchased by the North China United Bank, the potential was suddenly tightened, so the buying frenzy was extremely vigorous for a time. In addition, Tianjin banks and Hong Kong banks secretly competed to buy, so the market price once rose to a high of 2,037 yuan. Later, it was suddenly heard that the foreign exchange was dumped by foreign wires and gradually returned to normal, so many general households tended to sell for profit. A certain silver building, acting on behalf of a businessman, was the first to sell, and a certain gold shop also turned from buying to selling, so the price plummeted, breaking into the 30 yuan level. Finally, due to the resurgence of the foreign exchange buying spree, it repeated to gather, and the Tianjin banks' buying intention re-emerged and repeatedly purchased, repeating the rise, and finally continued to rise by eight yuan. People's hearts in all directions were exceptionally firm, and the transaction was very lively, reaching 1,000 taels. The silver building's gold ornaments did not change. The customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Increased by Eight Yuan Again

Since morning, each bar (ten taels), initially due to the lingering effects of the previous day, the foreign exchange was heavily purchased by the North Bank (acting for the puppet bank), so the potential tightened, and people's hearts in the market became more firm and firm. Buyers shouted to buy at 2,030 yuan at the opening. It was not until 9:45 that a certain gold shop entered 50 taels of silver building help, with an opening price of 2,032 yuan. After the opening, the foreign exchange still reported softening, so the buying frenzy was even greater. In addition, a certain money exchange industry, acting on behalf of the Tianjin Bank and a certain gold shop, acting on behalf of the Hong Kong Bank, successively entered. Although a certain silver building acted on behalf of the businessman to profit, it was difficult to suppress the upward trend. The money exchange industry entered 50 taels of a certain silver building, with a price of 33 yuan. After a certain silver building sold it, it sold it to the gold shop for 50 taels, and the price was the same. A certain gold shop entered another 50 taels of silver building help, with a price of 35 yuan. Another gold shop entered 50 taels of money exchange industry, with a price of 37 yuan being the highest peak. But at 10:10, it suddenly reversed and turned tired. The foreign exchange was dumped by foreign wires, and the sellers suddenly became active. A certain silver building also carried out sales on behalf of a wealthy businessman, selling 50 taels each to the gold shop and a certain money exchange industry, with a price of 35 yuan each. After the gold shop accepted it, it immediately sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange industry, with a price of 34 yuan. The silver building help sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange industry, with a price of 33 yuan. The silver building help sold another 50 taels to a certain money exchange industry, with a price of 32 yuan. After this, the buyer's intention to enter became weaker, so it broke into the 30 yuan level. Gold shops mutually did 50 taels, with a price of 28 yuan. Silver building help sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange industry, with the same price. Gold shops sold 50 taels to the money exchange industry, with a price of 27 yuan. The money exchange industry sold 50 taels to the silver building help, with a price of 25 yuan. Finally, the silver building help sold 50 taels to the money exchange industry, with a price of 29 yuan as the noon price. In the afternoon, the potential military saw tightness again because the foreign exchange was absorbed by the China Bank. Moreover, the money exchange industry's intention to enter on behalf of the Tianjin Bank was strong again, so the initial opening rose by several yuan. First, the silver building help sold 50 taels to a certain money exchange industry, with a price of 34 yuan. A certain money exchange industry entered another 50 taels each from the silver building help and the same industry, with a price of 35 yuan each. Another 50 taels entered the silver building help, with a price of 36 yuan. Finally, the money exchange industry mutually did 50 taels, with a price of 2,035 yuan as the evening closing price, an increase of eight yuan compared to the previous day (a range of twelve yuan throughout the day). The selling price of the current gold number's gold plate was 2,045 yuan, and the purchase was 2,030 yuan. The current standard gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is no trading.

Gold Ornaments Still Hanging at the Original Price

The silver building's gold ornaments, the exchange out per tael, did not change. Datong Heng Lao Qingyun, etc., still responded to the original price of 206 yuan. New peers also hung the original price of 204 yuan, and purchased 198 yuan.

British Pure Gold Unchanged for Three Days

London, 25th. The price of British pure gold per ounce remains unchanged, still at 7 pounds 8 shillings and 8.5 pence. The Central Bank's purchase price of Chinese pure gold (spot gold) also remains at the original price of 1,213 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold has not changed, still being 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 9 li. The Shanghai standard gold price has also not changed, still being 1,209 yuan and 2 jiao.

### English and Japanese Gold Tickets Traded Frequently

Yesterday, the price of British pure gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate between British and American currencies rose by 0.0625. The foreign exchange system was very tight. Foreign firms were constantly settling accounts, and banks were not providing enough supply. Foreign wires were also rarely sold, so the process was weak. The American exchange rate was even tighter. Spot gold was still strong because the Tianjin banks were collecting it. Although retail investors were selling for profit, the market remained strong because the chips were dry. Foreign currencies continued to rise due to the support of foreign exchange and spot gold. The demand for British gold pounds was relatively strong, and the increase was slightly higher. Japanese gold tickets were also traded frequently. Few transactions were made through the association. Only Xiangfeng sold US gold tickets for 500 yuan, Hongchang sold Hong Kong tickets for 450 yuan, and Tongfeng sold British gold tickets for 100 pounds, all of which were absorbed by Dongtai. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds rose by 2 jiao, British gold tickets rose by 8 fen, US gold tickets rose by 1 fen, Hong Kong tickets rose by 6 li, French franc tickets rose by 1 li, Canadian tickets rose by 2 fen, and other currencies remained unchanged.

### British and Indian Silver Prices Diverge

Also, the Bombay silver report: the Indian silver market remains stable, with the spot price unchanged. Near and far terms both increased by one anna.

### Demand for Cash is Strong Again, Discount Rate Suddenly Returns to High

Yesterday's discount rate for foreign exchange drafts and bills suddenly rose from stable. Initially, it still hovered above 35 yuan per thousand yuan, which was still flat. Later, the discount rate increased to 36 yuan and 2.5 jiao due to the increased demand for cash. At noon, it was 36 yuan, and in the afternoon, it reached as high as 36 yuan and 5 jiao. Finally, it was 36 yuan and 2.5 jiao, which was one yuan higher than the previous day.

### "United Bank" Absorbs Foreign Exchange

Although Foreign Wires are Dumping, British and American Exchange Rates are Still Tight

The foreign exchange market was tight yesterday because the puppet bank of North China suddenly came to absorb it, and foreign firms and others were frequently settling accounts because the end of the year was approaching. However, most foreign banks were unwilling to provide settlements, so the situation was quite tight. At one point, the British gold was tightest, reaching 8.28125 pence, and the American gold reached 16.125 yuan. Fortunately, foreign wires and HSBC dumped it, so it gradually became flat. However, the result was still firm. The trading volume on that day was particularly strong. The Hong Kong exchange rate also showed a softening trend because foreign banks were quite strong in purchasing it.

In the early morning, London's large bars, both near and far, shrank. New York's spot price remained flat. London's raw gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate between British and American currencies did not change, the exchange rate between British and French currencies increased by 7 centimes, and the exchange rate between British and Shanghai currencies remained the same. The exchange rate between American and British currencies increased by 0.0625, the exchange rate between American and French currencies increased by 1.875, and the exchange rate between American and Shanghai currencies decreased by 3 fen. The central government's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. At the early opening, the bank's selling price for spot British exchange was 8.359375 pence, and the selling price for spot American exchange was 16.28125 yuan, both of which were flat compared to the previous closing. After the opening, although the foreign wires dumped British gold at 8.359375 pence, there was no change because the banks took advantage of the cheap prices. HSBC's listed price did not change. In addition, the balance tax on silver was reduced by 0.25. After this, the puppet bank of North China only absorbed British gold at 8.3125 pence and American exchange at 16.25 yuan. Moreover, it was difficult for foreign merchants to sell their stomachs, and the market price gradually tightened to 8.28125 pence for British gold and 16.125 yuan for American exchange. Suddenly, the foreign wires came again and sold American exchange to various British and American banks at 16.25 yuan. Both the Hui Bank and the banks also sold American exchange to foreign firms at 16.1875 and 16.25 yuan, and British gold at 8.328125 to 8.34375 pence. In addition, the money exchange industry also sold Hong Kong exchange to Andaholland Wahyi Huabi from 55.875 yuan to 56 yuan. The situation gradually returned to relaxation. The noon closing price was 8.34375 pence for British gold and 16.25 yuan for American exchange.

Later, China Bank did British gold at 8.328125 pence and American exchange at 16.25 yuan. Foreign commercial banks also did the same price with each other, so the situation lacked change. After entering, Chinese and foreign banks took in Hong Kong exchange from the money exchange industry at only 55.875 yuan and 55.75 yuan, causing the market price to be slightly higher. The evening closing price for banks was 8.328125 pence for British exchange and 16.21875 yuan for American exchange. As a result, British exchange was tighter by 0.03125, American exchange was softer by 0.0625, and Hong Kong exchange shrank by 0.0625 compared to the previous closing. The following is a record of the transactions that day.

### Securities: Public Debt is Flat and Tired

Yesterday's securities dark market was relatively stable. The crazy selling of the tenth of the previous day has stopped, so the rumors have gradually subsided. The fundamental reason why morale has not been boosted is still the outflow of spot goods caused by this decision to reform, the large households' selling of public prices, and the entry of cotton yarn to seek unexpected profits is also one of the reasons. If there are no unexpected blows in the future, there will be a turning point after several rotations, because it has not suffered any fundamental damage. Yesterday's situation, the morning start was still very weak. First, there were sales of No. 7 and No. 59, and then there were outings of No. 31 and Tongkang, and the supply and demand were still very different, which was a little smaller than the previous day by one jiao to six jiao. In the afternoon, the selling pressure eased slightly. No. 4, except for the sale of Class B, had considerable income, and retail investors also slightly made up for the short positions. Class C and E were in greater demand, so the result was that Class C and E had rebounded by 4 jiao, and the rest continued to be smaller by 1 to 4 jiao. There are still many fluctuations in the future. The total turnover was 5 to 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

The stock turnover of the Zhonghua Book Company was more than 30 shares, and the price was 23 yuan and 3 jiao.

London Chinese foreign debt listed prices on the 25th of this month (Wednesday) still belonged to the market with no transactions, and the prices did not change much. Only the Chrisp Public Debt rose by another 1 pound, with a price of 35 pounds. The British Jin Shanhou Public Debt British issued debt tickets fell by 1.5 pounds, with a price of 48 pounds. There were two shipments of British physical goods today, including the Sino-French American Dollar 5% Public Debt with printed debt tickets, sold for 5,000 pounds (that is, 25,000 US dollars) with a selling price of 68 pounds, 17 shillings, and 6 pence, which is only a slight discount of 2 shillings and 6.75 pence according to the market price, but the selling price on the previous day shrank sharply by 17 shillings and 6 pence. Also, the Jinpu Railway original issued public debt German issued printed lottery debt tickets also sold for 25,000 pounds, with a selling price of 16.5 pounds, which is still a premium of 0.5 pounds, but the selling price on the previous day shrank by 0.5 pounds. It can be seen from this that the market sentiment is trending towards weakness.

London British Far East Company stock listed prices on the 25th of this month (Wednesday), the market has not changed.

### Kaiping Dividend Increases

Sales Surge, New Wells Opened

Since the Sino-Japanese War broke out, the demand for coal has increased sharply. From July 1937 to June 1938, the Kaiping Mining Bureau sold 4,213,000 tons of coal, an increase of 67,000 tons compared to the previous year. The gross operating profit also increased from 3,924,516 yuan in national currency to 12,368,157 yuan in national currency. After deducting the company's debt repayment fund of 2,260,242 yuan in national currency and the depreciation and amortization of 641,023 yuan in national currency, the remaining profit was 9,023,753 yuan in national currency, an increase of 3,271,756 yuan in national currency compared to the previous year's profit. It is equally distributed between the British Kaiping Coal Mining Company and the Chinese Australian Mining Company. The half of the Kaiping Coal Mining Company should be converted into 252,914 pounds in British gold, an increase of 77,849 pounds compared to the previous year's 175,065 pounds in British gold. Including interest income, it reached a total of 272,572 pounds in British gold. After deducting various payments, the net remaining was 215,212 pounds in British gold.

After the dividend was paid, the market price of the stock was 23 yuan in Shanghai for each share with a face value of 1 pound in British gold, and the London market price was 16 shillings and 6 pence in British gold.

### Yarn and Cotton: Speculators Unable to Drag On, Yarn Prices Fall Rapidly, Returning to the 400 Yuan Level, Futures of Japanese Yarn Squeezed

The yarn market, which had been rising for several days, suddenly fell yesterday, and the decline was quite sharp. This kind of rebound after a long rise is not surprising and is expected. Moreover, the rise in consecutive days was entirely due to the purchase of the financial sector, and it was not driven by the actual sales market. Therefore, once the speculators stopped buying, and the customer business remained bleak, the general spot merchants, seeing that the customer's needs were not coming, were eager to sell. The holders were also accumulating continuously, the amount was huge, and there was a sign of fullness. For a temporary rest, the chips were slightly relaxed, and the falling wind suddenly became strong. Moreover, 20 count Double Horse fell directly from 405 yuan to 396 yuan. Then, the decline was unavoidable. It was fierce and attracted a certain firm in Guangzhou to come to the market for cheap goods, so the false wind was stopped by it, and it rose again by 3 yuan. However, the fundamental problem of cotton yarn can still be stabilized one step further than in the past, because the raw materials are difficult to loosen. The future still depends on actual transactions to support the value.

Checking yesterday's spot yarn market, many people in the same industry were at a loss when the market opened in the morning. Inquiries revealed that actual sales were still unchanged, and speculators did not come. Only Shantou merchants had scattered transactions. However, sellers gathered, and the opening price of 20 count Double Horse was 405 yuan, which was not much different from the previous day. Only two packages were traded, and customers shouted sales continuously. Morale suddenly dropped, and market prices fell step by step. The price of 20 count Heavenly Girl fell from 398 yuan to 396 yuan. Double Horse fell by 5 yuan to 400 yuan, breaking the big barrier again, directly to 396 yuan. The stack order price fell to 394 yuan. After a while, the price became cheap, and Wanxing Company in Guangzhou came to enter the stack order goods, and speculators also came to collect, and immediately rose by 2 to 3 yuan. The final closing price of 20 count Double Horse was 399 yuan, and the stack order price was 397 yuan, and the momentum turned to a stable path. Check the statistics of 1,260 packages traded in the morning. Transactions in the same industry accounted for two-thirds. As a result, the market price of 20 count Double Horse fell by 6 yuan, Heavenly Girl fell by 6 yuan, White Flying Boat fell by 10 yuan, Flying Tiger fell by 5 yuan, and Double Earth fell by 4.5 yuan. The decline of 10 count coarse yarn was slower, because the bottom was thinner. The factory did not take any action. Today's exports included 80 pieces of cotton yarn to Tianjin, 50 pieces to Yantai, 20 pieces to Quanzhou, 300 pieces to Shantou, and 15 pieces to Hong Kong. The amount of purchases made by each group is recorded on the left.

The Japanese yarn market, because the end of January is approaching, all the short-selling ball transactions lacked backing, and buyers were unwilling to release them, so the local yarn price has fallen by 5 to 6 yuan. Japanese yarn is showing tight, and market prices continue to rise, but actual demand is still scattered. However, futures seem to have a squeezing appearance. The spot yarn price of 20 count Water Moon is 320 yuan, and the current month's price is 321 yuan, inverting the spot price. The spot yarn price of 20 count Blue Phoenix is 318 yuan, and the next month is 320 yuan.

### Foreign Cotton Also Unavailable, Huge Transactions

The market price of foreign cotton, American cotton, is currently quite firm because of the strong spot transactions, and exporters also have huge transactions. The government's loan cotton sales problem has not yet been resolved, so the cotton price when new flowers are released is difficult to predict. Yesterday, someone interviewed US Agriculture Secretary Henry Wells and asked about the intention of convening an international cotton industry conference. According to Mr. Wells, this conference is nothing new, but the oversupply of cotton is a serious problem shared by the world, which the United States cannot solve. For example, if all the US government's surplus loan cotton is sold to the world, the price of US cotton will inevitably fall to the 6-cent level. At that time, the economic difficulties of the United States can be broken, and domestic exports can also take the opportunity to sell US cotton, and farmers can also dump their products, while cotton growers and exporters in India, Brazil, and Egypt will be severely hit. Finally, Mr. Wei said to others that it was his intention to hold an international cotton industry conference, but he never wanted to invite others to come, but hoped that the cotton-producing countries could automatically and enthusiastically participate. Yesterday, New York rose by 2 to 3 pounds, India including forecasts fell by half a rupee, and Egypt fell by 7 to 8 pounds. Yesterday's exchange rate did not change much. Converted into legal currency, American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 2 jiao per dan, while Indian cotton and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 2 jiao.

Yesterday, there were no huge transactions in the foreign cotton market in this city. Except for Anda Factory's order of 500 bales of Indian cotton Bairoch, with a combined delivery price of 72 yuan, the rest of the factories were very quiet. According to public opinion, if the exchange rate for foreign cotton transactions can be extended, each factory will purchase in large quantities because the inventory will be exhausted. The amount of transactions and prices are listed below.

### In the Midst of Factory Closures, the Selling Price of White Pack Cotton is Still High

The local cotton business is becoming more depressed. The market price of white pack cotton remains firm. The factories are unanimously procuring Indian and American coarse and fine cotton to replenish, and the local cotton is about to close. In fact, the source is thin, the bottom has dried up, the selling price is very high, and there is no huge amount to buy. The situation is not satisfactory, and there is no good way to save it without adjusting foreign cotton. As for the cotton shops, in view of the difficult transportation routes, the north is controlled and not allowed to export, and the Qun Daqing company is mostly trading in foreign cotton, which shows the lack of local cotton. Japanese factories have been lifeless for a long time, but their foreign cotton purchase orders are very enthusiastic. The source of Tonghua is still not thin. The dock has 2,495 bales, and 580 pieces from Xin'gang, 330 pieces from Baimao, and 900 pieces from Beisha. There are still 40 pieces exported to Quanzhou and 20 pieces to Hong Kong. The current cotton selling prices and quantities are recorded on the left.

### Piece Goods: Stockpiling of National Cloth is Extremely Strong, and the Financial Sector is the Most Prominent, East Piece Hand Goods are Unwilling to Sell Lightly

The actual sales of national cloth in various regions, except for the Sichuan-Yunnan merchants, are shrinking. However, the stockpiling of the same industry is extremely strong, and the financial sector is the most prominent. The stockpiling volume is counted in thousands of pieces per batch. There have also been huge transactions of military coarse cloth. Recently, Nantong Dasheng Yarn Factory has sold more than 100 pieces of 16-pound Double Dragon coarse cloth. The prices of various grades of coarse cloth in the factory have also been raised by 1 to 2 jiao each. Yihe coarse cloth, Ning-Shao merchants purchased more than 100 pieces of the same grade of cloth according to the market price. Weihaiwei merchants purchased 50 bales of Double Cage and other brands of coarse cloth. Dyeing factories in this street purchased 40 to 50 pieces of fine twill. Fuchou, floral cloth, satin, chopped pattern, and blank cloth are the most frequent deliveries of orders this month. The demand from Wen, Yong, and Taiwan merchants is still strong, and there are still telegrams urging deliveries every day. However, the Shanghai factories have not been able to load smoothly due to the tightening of silver remittance quotas. The amount of colored twill, colored cloth, bleached cloth, bleached twill, Kunming, and Chengdu is the most, and more than 2,500 pieces are continuously procured. The Taizhou area of Jiangbei merchants added 1,200 pieces of satin, serge, tribute, and various colors of blue cloth. Jiangxi Guangfeng and the Zhejiang road Tiantai, Suian, and Shaoxing are more indifferent in their buying. Only 4 to 500 pieces of tribute, flannel, bleached cloth, and colored cloth were packed.

East cloth, yesterday's fine cloth and fine twill sales, because the actual sales and the stockpiling of Japanese yuan were mutually pulling up prices, gradually rising. Fine cloth is especially needed. The Dragon Head and Color Ball brands are regarded as the standard, and each piece has increased sharply by 1 jiao and a half. Fine twill has risen by 5 fen to 1 jiao. Throughout the day, all brands of fine cloth and fine twill were sold. The dyeing factories on this street and the hoarders with market goods in mind have entered more than 2,000 pieces. Tianjin merchants have also written in nearly 1,000 pieces. The general psychology of the industry is that in view of the high market price, it is difficult to compensate. Even if there are hand goods, they are all tightened and not loosened, so the market is very firm.

Today's exports include 400 pieces of piece goods to Yantai, 40 pieces to Yuhe, 265 pieces to Quanzhou, and 155 pieces to Shantou.

### Silk and Tea   Silk Market Disorder

White filature price for end-users rises by one hundred yuan; Indo-French firm suddenly deals in raw silk.

Yesterday, the silk market saw Japanese and American interests seemingly firm; the Exchange market situation saw a slight increase of 0.05 taels in New York, while Yokohama rose by one yuan. Local sales to British and French exporters have not yet begun. In the local market, the price for end-users is thirty yuan higher than that of foreign firms, so the center of gravity of the silk market has not yet shifted. However, end-user transactions lack standards, and buyers are often overly optimistic, making disorder inevitable. Yesterday, the general selling price of White Filature B was 1360 yuan. The price of superior quality B-grade silk of 20-22 denier threads was approaching 1400 yuan. A total of 350 piculs were traded. The Indo-French firm suddenly became active yesterday, with 50 piculs of "Thousand Gold White Soil" silk traded at an opening price of 550 yuan, an increase of 5 to 10 yuan compared to the previous calculation. (The white filature price for end-users has already risen by one hundred yuan compared to the previous month.)

### Grain   Flour Sales to North China Suddenly Brisk; Exports Today Also Not Weak

Yesterday, the flour market saw a sudden surge in sales. Early in the morning, transactions among customer groups were quite lively. A major merchant in North China was also absorbing flour in the market, leading to increased transactions. Various small-scale buyers from Yantai, Qinhuangdao, and other places showed a growing appetite. South Seas buyers also became eager to purchase. The market immediately became lively. A total of 60,000 to 70,000 bags of various brands of flour, including No. 2, 3, and 4, were sold. Nearly 10,000 bags were handled by this street. The majority of the buyers were from Hebei and Shandong provinces, followed by those from Shantou. The price of No. 2 flour of "Vehicle and Ship" brand remained stable at the original price of 4.8 yuan, "Blue Ship" brand at 4.6 yuan, "Red Blue Fisherman" at 4.4 yuan, and "Red God of Wealth" at 4.35 yuan. The market has already felt stable.

Today, flour exports include 7,000 bags to Tianjin, 3,000 bags to Yantai, 1,400 bags to Xinghua, 1,500 bags to Xiuyu, and 18,500 bags to Shantou.

### Wheat   Mill Demand is Relatively Strong; However, Price Increases and Decreases are Both Difficult

Yesterday, the wheat market situation was difficult for both increases and decreases, continuing to show a fluctuating trend. Inquiries from various mills have increased compared to before. Recently, the source of supply in various places has been limited. Yesterday, 600 bags arrived from Xingang. The goods owners, considering the production price plus miscellaneous expenses, found that the cost was higher than that in the Shanghai market, and they were unwilling to sell at a loss. The mills, seeing that the trend was difficult to suppress, gradually revealed their eagerness. As a result, the number of transactions remained limited. A total of 2,000 bags of Wuhu purple skin wheat and Chaozhou wheat, and 3,000 bags of Jiangbei Puzhen wheat were jointly handled by Fuxin and Fufeng Mills. The highest price was still 4.8 yuan, with a slight decrease of a few cents for medium-quality wheat.

### Rice Market Difficult to Advance

Warehouse stocks are congested and sales are sluggish

Domestic Rice: Yesterday, a total of over 6,000 bags of "He Xia No. 14" and "Vehicle Wheel Bun" rice arrived. The sales field is still sluggish. It is heard that the warehouses in Shanghai are congested with stocks, with some holding 700,000 bags, causing panic. Large hoarders feel that there is nowhere to store additional goods if they want to purchase. Because of the unstable market, this street rarely inquires about purchases, so most of the goods failed to be sold. The market is stagnant, and the price of thick and thin japonica rice has fallen by a few cents to a dime. Duyang and Jianduan also fell by about a dime, but Bianyuan rice is still holding its original price due to the scarcity of goods and the relatively firm foothold.

Customer Xian Rice: Yesterday's source of supply continued to arrive by train. 1,800 bags came from Hupu. Although new shipments have not yet been fully cleared, the goods stored are still continuously arriving in Shanghai. Major merchants and brokers still want to hold on and wait for a good price, while small merchants plan to close their positions as soon as possible. Affected by the arrival of "Benjian" rice, which sold sharply and fell by a dime, Jingwu and other xian rice were suppressed by 5 to 6 cents. "Gaojing" xian rice, which was previously quoted at 11 yuan, was willing to be sold at 10.08 or 0.09 yuan, while the unspoken price of Zhongguan Ju fell below the 10 yuan mark, it is said.

### Miscellaneous Grains  Soybean Market Active

Soybean Arrivals: Because the Lunar New Year is approaching, most traders have rushed to close their positions, so the source of supply is scarce, and the stock is in good shape because the market is active in sales. Superior and medium-grade goods are the most popular because purchases tend to avoid the heavy and take the light. Therefore, the market rose by another 5 to 6 cents yesterday, with over 2,000 bags of various soybeans traded. The destinations are still mainly five or six groups of buyers from Hong Kong, Lϋ, Shantou, Xiamen, and this street. As for import and export conditions, yesterday 2,650 bags of soybeans arrived from Tianjin, 2,200 bags of peanuts arrived from Yantai, and 220 bags of peanuts arrived from Weihaiwei. Today (27th), 1,090 bags of soybeans are being shipped to Shantou, 790 bags to Hong Kong, 1,020 bags to Quanzhou, 480 bags to Xiuyu, and 1,840 bags of soybeans to other ports. 200 bags of peanuts are being shipped to Shantou, 120 bags to Quanzhou, 3,310 bags to Hong Kong, 11,000 pieces of soybean cake to Shantou, 1,700 pieces to Xinghua, 8,200 pieces to Quanzhou, 550 pieces to Xiuyu, 200 pieces of peanut oil to Quanzhou, and 2,350 pieces to Hong Kong. 3,500 cans also arrived from Weihaiwei yesterday.

### Wheat Bran Turns Sharply Upward

Wheat bran sales in the mainland market are in great demand during this twelfth lunar month, and with the support of some gardeners, the market has turned sharply upward in the past two days. Yesterday, the market for Fuxin large bags opened at 3.27 yuan and quickly rose to 3.3 yuan, closing at 3.35 yuan. The trend is that the Lunar New Year is approaching, and hoarding is mostly based on capacity, and the momentum in the market feels short, so the actual demand is strong and the market price is easy to prosper, it is said.

### Sugar Market  Hainan Red Rises Another Two Dimes

Yesterday's sugar market saw quieter transactions and a stable trend. The Association's quoted price for No. 24 Dutch raw white spot goods was 24.85 yuan. Goods from this warehouse were 25 yuan, and transshipment goods were 16.8 yuan. Taikoo "Vehicle White" remained stagnant. "B Mark" East warehouse goods were 23.85 yuan, and West warehouse goods were 23.95 yuan. The lower grades also lacked changes. Domestic sugar houses, such as Chaozhou's Qibai, Zhiyang, and Chenchaoqing, continued to offer limited quantities at the same prices. Newly arrived white packaged Hainan red sugar from Guangdong had a better color and luster, with 201 bags opening at 12.4 yuan, an increase of 2 dimes compared to the previous quotation. Only a few dozen bags of inferior white sugar were offered from Fujian at the original price. Because of the lack of goods in the production area, the owners of superior white sugar all instructed to hold their positions and unanimously called for increases, but because "Vehicle White" in the Shanghai market was more suitable, it was unable to rise excessively.

### Metals   Black Iron Sheet Sells as Soon as it Arrives

The market for black iron sheet has been quite brisk recently. Vacuum bottle factories have a large appetite for sales, and enamel factories also have a strong intention to purchase, so there is a feeling that the market is short of circulating goods. Since the day before yesterday, new goods have arrived at Xin Taikoo, Qichang, Gonghexing and other warehouses, but most of the goods that arrived have been sold, so there is still a lack of spot goods in the market, and the market is still able to maintain prices without falling. Currently, 26-inch goods are selling for 24 yuan, and 36-inch goods are quoted at prices ranging from 25 to 27 yuan. First-grade goods are quoted at 15.5 yuan, and second-grade billet goods are sold for 14 yuan. It is estimated that over 2,000 to 3,000 piculs were sold yesterday, but they were all purchased by local factories in this street, and few customer groups handled purchases, it is said.

### Dried and Preserved Goods  Green Cake Arrives by Day Ship

From Tianjin

Because six to seven hundred bags of green cake have arrived by day ships for several consecutive days, there is no concern for a shortage, and the market suddenly loosened. Yesterday, it was heard that the opening price was 13 yuan, settled at 12.8 to 12.6 yuan. Because the upper grades also turned down, Gen cake was 16 yuan, box Zhuang Pai cake was 14 yuan, and the next grade was 13.8 yuan. Mainland buyers are still continuing to purchase, but with the increased arrival of goods, the sellers will find it difficult to maintain prices.

Yesterday, 250 bags of jujubes arrived from Tianjin.

### Letter   The Indian Cotton Purchased by Shenxin is Sold by the Fuka Foreign Firm

To Whom It May Concern: According to a letter from member Jifeng Cotton Shop, the "Shenbao" commercial news foreign cotton transaction column today stated that Shenxin imported 300 pieces of Indian cotton spot goods, and that this cotton was owned by a certain stock company, which is inconsistent with the facts. On the 24th of this month, our shop purchased 300 pieces of Indian cotton spot goods delivered to the warehouse from the Fuka Foreign Firm, a foreign merchant in this city, at 64 yuan in cash per group, and then sold them to Shenxin No. 2 Factory on the 25th of the same month at 65.3 yuan in cash per picul delivered to the factory. There are complete orders to prove this. We request that your association write a letter requesting correction, etc. According to this, the various sections mentioned in the letter are all true, and there is order proof. The results of your newspaper's investigation are obviously inconsistent. As it concerns the reputation of merchants, we request that you promptly correct this to show the truth. Respectfully, the Shanghai Cotton Yarn Trade Association, January 26, year 28.

### Q&A   Small Flour Mills Available for Purchase

To Mr. Song Shuliang,

Regarding the small flour mill, we have received a letter from Anli Foreign Firm stating that it is available. The ones handled by the firm are all products from famous British factories. You can directly contact them by mail. In addition to sending the original letter by mail, we also hope that you will put it into practice to improve the local industry with machines and build the countryside, and be the foundation for the revival of China.

### The Efficacy of Duck Juice

— Qin Bo

Chicken juice and beef juice already known for their efficacy, duck juice as a nourishing product after illness

Nourishment must suit the constitution. The efficacy of chicken juice and beef juice is well known, but duck juice is also an excellent nourishing product after febrile diseases.

First, theoretically speaking: febrile diseases most easily burn qi and blood, consuming fluids, so after illness, there are often deficiency-heat phenomena such as dry mouth, emaciation, constipation, and yellow urine. Duck's nature is sweet and cold, sweet can tonify the middle, and cold can clear heat, so it mainly tonifies the middle, removes exogenous heat, and benefits the viscera and water passages (see Compendium of Materia Medica). Using it to nourish febrile diseases has the wonderful effect of strengthening the wall and clearing the field.

Second, practically speaking: when febrile diseases have largely subsided, but the body and spirit are exhausted and appetite is sluggish, consuming duck juice makes one feel clear, rich, and palatable, gradually stimulating the appetite. Without the use of intestinal moisturizing agents, bowel movements are naturally smooth, and without the use of water-regulating formulas, urination naturally increases. After four or five days, the efficacy is significant, far surpassing ginseng and dendrobium.

The method of making juice is the same as that of chicken juice, but the oil floating on top of the duck juice must be removed completely, only drinking the clear liquid. The amount can be as much or as little as desired. By extension, for those with yin deficiency and internal heat who seek nourishment, this is also the best choice. Many patients who have been instructed by me and have benefited cannot be listed exhaustively. If anyone sees this article and confirms its efficacy, I would be grateful.

### Nocturnal Emission

— Xie Yenong

Nocturnal emission is quite common among young people. The cause of nocturnal emission as a disease is mostly due to the result of masturbation, which is a matter of education, so let us set it aside for the moment. In terms of disease, there is still the matter of dreaming of nocturnal emissions. The pathology is mostly due to weakness of the kidneys, the vas deferens losing its ability to protect, resulting in frequent emissions, four or five times a month for the mild cases, eight or nine times for the severe cases. People with initial nocturnal emissions often neglect it and do not pay attention, or because they are ashamed to tell others, they are unwilling to seek medical treatment, allowing the disease to gradually worsen. Over time, the constitution becomes increasingly weak, developing into pale complexion, listlessness, weak memory, dizziness, tinnitus, sore waist, thinness, and other weak phenomena, affecting the studies and careers of young people. It is no small matter. Those suffering from this disease should be vigilant!

Euryale ferox, also known as Gorgon Fruit, is often sold by vendors carrying loads in alleys during July and August (South goods stores sell it at halftime). This thing is sweet and astringent, has the effect of strengthening the kidneys, tonifying the spleen, benefiting essence, and treating nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea. Regular consumption can cure both new and old nocturnal emissions. For consumption, wash the Euryale ferox clean, boil it in water, add a little white sugar, and eat it as a snack; or grind the Euryale ferox into a fine powder, mix it with white sugar, and take it with boiling water. Another method is to cook porridge with two ounces of japonica rice and one ounce of Euryale ferox every day. These two methods combine treating the disease with diet, and the price is low, both economical and convenient. Those suffering from nocturnal emission may wish to try it.

Heart of lotus can also be used as a snack. During the summer lotus season, there is a kind of lotus stamen, which is collected by pharmacies as a medicine for treating nocturnal emission and leucorrhea. If you keep fresh lotus stamens in mind, boiling them to make tea is surprisingly effective for treating nocturnal emission. In addition, there are two kinds of Coix Seed (also known as Yi Ren Rice) and Rosa laevigata (fruit food), which are also wonderful dietary supplements for treating nocturnal emission.

### Aconite

— Liu Minshu

Wind paralysis and prevention of wind paralysis

Aconite is shaped like a taro and is not a strange thing in itself. It is produced in Sichuan, and the people of Sichuan often use it as food. According to customs and habits, whenever they feel heavy, they use aconite and beef, cooked together as a side dish. Not only is it palatable and filling, but it also has the effect of preventing wind paralysis. Taking it for a long time makes the body light and strong, and the spirit is doubled. If it is not cooked for a long time, it will only cause numbness. Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong are low-lying and close to the sea, and are prone to wind-cold-dampness diseases. Those who want to prevent them can try cooking and taking it. The method is to use half a catty of beef, one tael of white aconite block, and a piece of ginger broken into pieces. Cook them together for six hours, without adding salt. If you cannot eat it bland, you can add a little salt. When eating, the white aconite block should also be chewed finely and eaten. Those who have already suffered from wind paralysis, numbness, soreness, and pain will definitely see results if they take it regularly.

### Two Formulas for Frostbite

— Gong Xingqi

(One)

In winter, if the hands and feet are exposed to cold for too long, the qi and blood will stagnate, and the extravasated blood will break out of the blood vessels and gather into red lumps, which will cause frostbite. When exposed to heat, it will first itch, and then ulcerate. If the congealed and extravasated blood is not dispersed, the ulceration will become deeper and deeper, and it will not heal for a long time. This formula uses the method of relieving coagulation and activating blood to treat it. The formula uses eight qian of Imperata cylindrica ginger, four qian of Evodia rutaecarpa, and four qian of safflower. Boil them in water and wash the affected area. Regardless of whether the frostbite has ulcerated or not, it is extremely effective. If it has not ulcerated, washing with this decoction will disperse the extravasated blood and prevent it from ulcerating. If it has ulcerated, you must first disperse the congealed extravasated blood before you can activate blood and generate muscle. Otherwise, it will not heal by spring, leaving a deep scar. Laborers cannot move because of this, which is especially pitiful. Wealthy families also suffer greatly from this disease. Although the herbs in this formula are not strange, the treatment is correct. It is extremely easy to obtain and inexpensive to use. It has been used repeatedly with effective results, and many people have been cured. For severe cases, wash several more times. I hereby make it public to help those who are displaced, cold, and poor to relieve the pain in their hands and feet, which is also my wish.

(Two) Lan Xiaomei

When the northwest wind rises, friends suffering from frostbite will all frown, burdened with worries. It will not only be red, swollen, and feverish, but also unbearably itchy. After ulceration, it will ooze water and form scabs that do not fall off. It will then heat up again, itch again, and ooze water, continuously extending for three or four months.

The cause of frostbite is that dampness stagnates in the capillaries. When it is blown by the cold wind, it coagulates with the blood and becomes inflamed, thus causing redness, swelling, fever, itchiness, and even ulceration. Although there are many methods to treat frostbite, they are all superficial treatments that cannot be thorough, so the treatment cannot eradicate the root cause. Moreover, dampness always has to find a way out. If frostbite does not develop, other diseases will develop, and the pain is still unavoidable.

Now I can introduce a very effective prescription: When frostbite has already formed red and swollen lumps, urgently use five qian of Ramulus Cinnamomi, five qian of walnut kernels, three qian of Carthamus tinctorius, and two qian of Ligusticum chuanxiong (buy from a Chinese medicine shop). Boil them in water, to about half a washbasin, simmer thoroughly and wash the affected area while hot, once in the morning and once in the evening. Do not discard the herbs and water, you can boil and wash again. Wash it more than ten times, so that it does not ulcerate and the lumps disappear. After it disappears, take 1.5 qian of tangerine peel, 3 qian of raw Coix Seed, 1.5 qian of Polyporus umbellatus, and 1 qian of Pinellia ternata, and use the previous soup as a substitute for tea for three to five days. If you don't mind, you can take it for a few more days. After this, it will not be easy to suffer again. If you suffer again, still use the previous method. Washing and taking the medicine at most no more than three times, and it will never happen again. The principle is as follows: the washing formula is to unblock the meridians, activate the collaterals, and harmonize the blood vessels. The taking formula is to transform dampness without drying. It can be used regardless of whether it is cold or heat. The effect is extremely effective. Those who suffer from it can try it!

A Small Collection of Tonics

### Beef

— Zhang Ruwei

Beef is mild in nature, bland and slightly sweet in taste, without rancidity, and rich in nutrients. It functions to strengthen the spleen and stomach, and increase strength. Extracting meat and boiling it into a paste, commonly known as Xia Tian Paste, that is, beef juice, warms and nourishes the spleen and stomach, and greatly tonifies the original qi. Its fat is sufficient to moisten dryness and relieve constipation; drinking it with milk can relieve heat toxins and tonify deficiency and fatigue, and also treat vomiting and dysphagia; eating it with bile brightens the eyes and can also treat traumatic injuries. When cooking beef, you can use chestnuts, dioscorea, or spinach, and eat it when it is extremely soft.

### Black Dates and Fructus Quisqualis can Eliminate Worm Accumulation

— Ding Jimin

Children with worm accumulation are quite common, which is caused by accidentally eating food with worm eggs (so raw vegetables and fish should be cooked thoroughly, otherwise they may contain hatchable worm eggs). In the beginning, the abdomen is swollen and uncomfortable, digestion is poor, bowel movements are irregular, or fever and love to eat foreign objects, the body becomes increasingly thin, the face is yellow and the spirit is tired, irritable and uneasy, grinding teeth in sleep and other symptoms. Fructus Quisqualis (available at Chinese medicine shops, that is, Western medicine Santonin) can be inserted into black dates, steamed until cooked, and fed to children. Each child should eat five or six black dates at a time. Three or four hours after taking it, take another dose of mild laxative (convenient pills sold on the market are also available). Take it for two or three consecutive days to eliminate the worms completely. This method has been seen in European internal medicine, and it is also praised as the best anthelmintic in China. Fructus Quisqualis has been a sacred medicine for dispelling worms in China for thousands of years, and when combined with black dates, it also has the effect of harmonizing the stomach and calming the center.

### The Benefits and Drawbacks of Alcohol

— Zhang Ruwei

It is customary to regard alcohol as a bad drink, but the function of alcohol is to relieve stagnation, eliminate hostility, and in traditional Chinese medicine processing methods, many drugs are stir-fried or boiled with alcohol, using the taste of alcohol to promote the medicinal power, and there are even those who wash, rinse, or decoct with alcohol. Therefore, alcohol is not without benefits to people. Alcohol has sweet, bitter, pungent, and sour tastes, and has excitatory and stimulating properties. Its nature is hot and its quality is wet. Elderly people take a small amount to relieve cold, strengthen courage, harmonize blood, nourish qi, open joints, and benefit meridians, all of which have special advantages. Other such as Eleutherococcus gracilistylus wine, tiger bone papaya wine, and Shefeng wine have considerable effects in treatment. However, drinking too much alcohol will definitely lead to drunkenness. After being drunk, one's actions are abnormal and it is easy to damage the brain. And abdominal distension, jaundice, rapid drinking, vomiting, thirst and other symptoms, there are many that are caused by drinking alcohol. For methods to sober up from drunkenness, there is Gegen flower sobering decoction, or decocting a thick juice of Cephalotaxus sinensis to pour down, or frequently taking clear soy sauce soup.

### How to Harmonize Flavors Talking about "Over-Medicine" Foods

— Ni Xi

Nowadays, most people have some understanding of daily health maintenance, disease taboos, and post-disease conditioning items; however, very few people pay attention to the "over-medicine" path of taking medicine, which is actually closely related to the medicine force of the diseased body, with a great impact on the progress of the illness, so I will specifically put this point forward to talk about:

When people are sick and need to take decoction, it is unavoidable that it is bitter and difficult to swallow, and even if they see the medicine bowl, they will feel nauseous, so they have to borrow some palatable and flavorful things to adjust this bitter taste.

Ordinary people always think that the disease has medicinal power to resist, and for "over-medicine" items, they may be arbitrary, as long as they relieve the bitterness and refresh the mouth, who knows that if they encounter foods that have anti-pathological medicinal properties, then a big impact will occur, such as cold-dampness or damp-heat disease, the prescription uses dried ginger, Pinellia ternata, tangerine peel, or Atractylodes lancea, Magnolia officinalis, etc., although the mouth feels dry, it is appropriate to use light-flavored candies, or preserved tangerine peel with green salt, Buddha's hand and other products, if greedily eating raw and cold fruits, the spleen and stomach will be invaded by cold-dampness, I am afraid that not only will the medicinal power fail, but more vomiting and adverse reactions will occur. If it is a dryness-heat fire symptom, the prescription uses Scrophularia ningpoensis, Rehmannia glutinosa, Gypsum fibrosum, Anemarrhena asphodeloides and other flavors, then it is appropriate to use fruits and cool moisturizing products, if you like to eat spicy flavors or rich sweet things, the heat evil will linger, and the condition may increase and prolong. For example, if it is a weakness disease, the prescription uses ginseng, Astragalus membranaceus, Atractylodes macrocephala, Angelica sinensis and other flavors, it is appropriate to use candies, sweet warmth, or fragrant and other products, if because of disease habits and food taboos, still eating soy sauce, turnip, large-headed cabbage and other things, it is inevitable to eliminate the medicinal properties. For example, if it is a solid accumulation disease, the prescription uses Citrus aurantium, rhubarb, betel nut, Shen Qu and other flavors, it is appropriate to use strong tea, coffee sugar, fruit sugar and other products, if still eating cakes and pastries, sticky, smoked and roasted types, it is inevitable to increase the disease qi and reduce the medicinal power.

Therefore, "over-medicine" items have a great relationship with the medicine power of the diseased body, whether they are compatible or not. It can be divided into three categories: Sweet-flavored, such as candies, are suitable for mild cold symptoms, and all conditioning medicines. Salty-flavored, such as green salt olives, preserved tangerine peel, Buddha's hand, pepper salt peach slices and the like, are suitable for throat wind heat symptoms, and all qi-regulating medicines. Cooling and moisturizing, such as various fruits, are suitable for fire-heat dryness symptoms, and yin-nourishing medicines. But no matter what kind of decoction is taken, to require the medicinal properties to play quickly and the pathology to be completely unaffected, it is better to boil some bitter taste, take a sip and swallow it straight down, and then use a glass of plain boiled water, rinse your mouth two or three times, or drink one or two sips with it, which is the best way, otherwise, if you want to use "over-medicine", you also have to pay special attention.

### Changes in Symptoms and Dietary Procedures for Typhoid Fever (III)

— Chen Cunren

The changes in the symptoms of typhoid fever are as described above. The full text is not yet finished. Now I will talk about the dietary procedures. To summarize, it can be set as four standards: when there is heat, you must strictly abide by the word "hunger"; when the fever subsides, you must abide by the word "caution"; when you are greedy for food after recovery, you must abide by the word "moderation"; when you are weak and tired after recovery, you must abide by the word "nourishment".

During the period of typhoid fever with heat, you must be "hungry" for ten million. That typhoid fever can be cured is partly the responsibility of the doctor, and partly it depends on the patient being able to abide by this word "hunger". As the saying goes, "typhoid fever does not starve to death", that is to say, patients with typhoid fever should be hungry for a long time, and hunger for a long time will not lead to death. Do not worry that hunger and not eating will be a concern.

The source of typhoid fever lies in the stomach and intestines. To explain it with a simple reason, it can be pointed out that the heat of typhoid fever is due to the blockage in the intestines. The abdomen and intestinal parts are congested and inflamed, and the fullness is like "a section of sausage". If the evil congestion in the intestines is not cleared for a day, the cold and heat will not subside for a day. It is necessary to "use medicine to dredge; hunger to eliminate stagnation" before the cold and heat greatly reduce, and the disease situation begins to have hope of turning danger into safety.

Therefore, if you take food when you have a fever, it is tantamount to increasing the congestion in the intestines, making the intestinal inflammation worse, and the symptoms become increasingly profound. Ordinary people think that if you don't eat, you will be hungry, if you don't eat for three days, you will get sick, and if you don't eat for seven days, you will die. After ten days of cold and heat, people are always worried about not eating, and they want to give them food, even disobeying the doctor's advice and secretly giving them food. One of the most common reasons why some typhoid fever patients cannot be cured is this.

It must be known that during typhoid fever, the digestive function has stopped completely due to the congestion in the intestines. There is no need for food to supply consumption, so the patient does not feel hungry for a very long period of time. The length of time depends on the disease, and not eating for a month is very common.

Some may doubt that during the fever period, the body consumes a lot of physical strength, and prolonged hunger will inevitably cause the body to not be able to support itself. This doubt is always the source of death from typhoid fever. It must be known that during the fever period, if you enter a state of weakness and fatigue, the doctor's medicine already has nourishing medicines included in the prescription, why worry.

National Medicine and Food Therapy (Second Edition)

### Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Theory: Chinese Diet Conforms to the Principles of Nutritional Therapy

— Yao Ruoqin

I once read Kang Liede's "Sun Yat-sen and the Awakening of China," which stated that when Mr. Sun was eighteen years old, he studied at the Guangzhou Boji Hospital. In 1887, when the Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese was established, he transferred to that college, studied diligently for five years, and graduated first in his class. He then established a hospital in Portuguese Macau and became very famous. This shows that Mr. Sun had a profound understanding of medicine. However, his ambition was to rejuvenate the Qing Dynasty and establish the Republic of China. He initially did not want to be known as a doctor, so he single-mindedly devoted himself to the revolution and no longer used medicine to help the world.

Now, I have found a section of his writings, which I am eagerly transcribing to offer to readers, so that they can see that although Mr. Sun studied Western medicine, he still made great efforts to preserve the advantages of Chinese medicine, and he also highly praised the characteristics of Chinese diet. Ruoqin Zhi

In the modern evolution of Chinese civilization, we lag behind others in everything, but the progress in diet is still unmatched by civilized countries today. The foods invented in China are far more abundant than those in Europe and America, and the excellence of Chinese cooking is also unmatched by Europe and America. As for the Chinese people's dietary habits, they are no different from the latest theories invented by the most enlightened medical hygienists in Europe and America today.

Why do I say this? The inventions of Chinese food, such as the eight treasures mentioned in ancient times, are certainly not necessary for daily life. But even ordinary daily items, such as golden needles, wood ear, tofu, and bean sprouts, are excellent vegetarian foods, which many European and American countries do not even know are foods. As for meat, the Chinese consider the internal organs of livestock to be delicacies, while the British and Americans did not eat them in the past, but in recent years they have also come to regard them as delicacies. When I was in Guangzhou, I saw Westerners despise the Chinese for eating pig blood, considering it crude and barbaric. But now, after research by medical hygienists, it has been found that pig blood contains a particularly high amount of iron, making it a top-grade supplement. People with anemia, after childbirth, and all those with blood deficiency, who used to be treated with chemical iron supplements, are now all treated with pig blood. The iron contained in pig blood is organic iron, which is more suitable for the human body than inorganic chemical iron supplements. Therefore, pig blood as a food is not only good for people with illness to nourish their bodies, but also beneficial for healthy people to strengthen their bodies. The Chinese eating it is not only not crude and barbaric, but also highly scientific and hygienic. This is just one example of food. There are countless other foods that have existed in China since ancient times but are unknown to Westerners.

The enjoyment of pleasing the eyes and the sound of pleasing the ears are both arts. Why is the taste of pleasing the mouth not? Cooking is also one of the arts. The art of cooking in Western countries is best in France, and Western civilization is also highest in France; the art of cooking originates from civilization. The wonders of Chinese cooking are also sufficient to show the depth of civilized evolution. In the past, before China and the West had trade relations, Westerners only knew that France was the world leader in cooking. But once they tasted Chinese food, they all considered China to be the leader. In recent times, Mr. He was the first Westerner to travel to the interior of China. During the Daoguang and Xianfeng reigns of the Qing Dynasty, he secretly traveled to various provinces and reached Tibet. In his travelogue, he praised Chinese civilization in many ways, and believed that Chinese seasoning was the world leader. In recent years, the Chinese dietary style has been widely spread in places where overseas Chinese have arrived. In New York City, there are hundreds of Chinese restaurants. Almost every American city has a Chinese restaurant. Americans' love for Chinese food is so great that it has aroused the jealousy of local competitors. They fabricated rumors that the soy sauce used by the Chinese contained toxic substances that harmed health, leading the municipal government of Turin to consider banning the use of soy sauce by the Chinese. Later, after strict examination by medical hygienists, the result was that soy sauce not only did not contain toxic substances, but also contained a lot of meat extract, the quality of which was no different from beef juice. It was not only harmless to health, but also very beneficial to the body. Therefore, the ban was lifted.

The Chinese people's dietary habits are secretly in line with scientific hygiene, and it can be said that they are beyond the reach of ordinary people in other countries. What ordinary Chinese people drink is green tea, and what they eat extravagantly is plain rice, with vegetables and tofu added. These foods have been found by today's hygienists to be most beneficial to health. Therefore, people in remote areas of China who do not eat meat often live longer. The prosperity of China's population and the fact that the Chinese people's ability to resist disease is often great is also due to the fact that their diet secretly conforms to hygiene.

### Introduction to Six Nutritious Foods

— Hu Xianglin

Every winter, people who are weak and prone to illness often consult doctors for supplements to aid recovery. However, "medicine is not as good as food," as the ancients have long taught. Here are several beneficial and harmless nutritious foods to introduce:

Chicken Juice Preparation: Remove the feathers, skin, bones, wings, head, and feet of a yellow hen. Place it in a porcelain jar, add a little wine, and simmer over a water bath. Drink only the juice. If you cook it yourself, there is often no standard for the heat, and it is easy to become chicken soup, which greatly reduces the effectiveness. Chicken juice made and sold by experts in the market is often taken, and it has a remarkable effect. It is better to change it for families that do not have dedicated people to pay attention to cooking.

Chicken juice is recognized by both Chinese and Western medicine as a supreme nutritious product. Eating chicken is very beneficial for lung diseases, and eating it after illness and childbirth is also greatly beneficial. (To be continued)

### Anemia Dietary Therapy

— Zhang Zanchen

The symptoms of anemia are pale skin and mucous membranes, fatigue, and frequent headaches, dizziness, tinnitus, nausea, and other symptoms. The causes are mostly due to obstacles or reductions in the regeneration of red blood cells, as well as indigestion and insufficient nutrition. Treatment is difficult with drugs and blood transfusions, but prescriptions are not available to ordinary people, and blood transfusions are only used for large amounts of bleeding. For chronic anemia, dietary therapy is most appropriate. Here are a few foods that are beneficial for anemia, as a dietary therapy for the family.

Dietary therapy is the intake of foods containing large amounts of nutrients to supplement the insufficient blood components. In terms of efficacy, the liver is the best. Therefore, in recent years, Western drug companies have mostly made liver extracts into liniments and injections, which are strictly a kind of proprietary medicine. However, after many years of trial and testing in treatment, I have found that when encountering people with anemia, I often tell them to buy beef liver, chicken liver, or pork liver as ordinary dishes, which have a good effect. Because the liver does contain a large amount of nutrients.

Other plants such as spinach, soybeans, potatoes, cabbage, peanuts, dates, and grapes also contain a lot of iron and are rich in nourishing ingredients. It will be beneficial to eat them often at will, and it will be more beneficial than taking medicine for treatment!

### Sects and Doctrines

— Yang Jinhao

There are sects formed because of doctrines, and there are those who treat sects as doctrines.

Sects formed because of doctrines discuss, act, and argue in order to implement the doctrines they believe to be true. Therefore, in the process of discussion, action, and argument, the false, distorted, and evil elements of each sect may be exposed and overcome, and the true, upright, and good elements will be revealed and elevated. As a result, either all sects work together towards the clarified truth, or the sects against the truth disintegrate, while the sects conforming to the truth expand and develop. In the end, the sectarianism of the sects will eventually evolve into a group that is solely dedicated to the truth. At that time, there will be something to follow, but it will no longer be a sect.

Treating sects as doctrines, then their discussions, actions, and arguments will only focus on the sects on which their fame and fortune depend. They only want to use the monopoly of their sects to seek personal advancement. Therefore, in the process of discussion, action, and argument, they are completely controlled by selfish desires and completely lose their rationality. They do not ask about right and wrong, truth and falsehood, or good and evil. They only know how to fabricate rumors, slander, nitpick, and distort attacks against those who disagree with them, so that they cannot rise to prominence or fall into ruin. As for those of the same sect, they will praise and promote each other, help each other scold and fight, and protect each other, seeking to confuse people and occupy a dominant position. But since they treat sects as doctrines, they must also take individuals as the basis, so within the sects, there is also a struggle for fame, fortune, power, and position among comrades, so that whether facing outsiders or insiders, they often harbor suspicion, making them blush and arguing loudly, unable to explain a single principle.

Since the rise of our country's war of resistance movement, in order to achieve national unity and solidarity, many criticisms have been made of sects. Recently, the bad roots of sects of various parties and groups have indeed been eradicated a lot, but there are still some that continue to act strangely. This is because the first type of sect, formed because of doctrines, naturally dissolved its sectarianism and rushed to the war of resistance when it recognized that the war of resistance was the truth. But the second type of sect, which treats sects as doctrines, only seeks to monopolize advancement, and is bound to disregard the truth and despise the war of resistance, attempting to use the development of its sectarianism to eliminate dissidents. Once this kind of sect is attacked by the forces of justice, it will resort to any means and willingly become a foreign slave and traitor, dreaming of prolonging its life or even raising the status of the sect.

Therefore, we must continue to intensify and relentlessly criticize and eliminate the second type of sect, no matter which department it belongs to!

### Wildfire

### Sending Gifts

— Pin

January in the solar calendar is the season of winter. Although the sun hangs high in the sky, there is not a trace of warmth. The north wind is blowing furiously, as if to make things difficult for us. We are all wearing mismatched cloth gowns, groping and walking on this already faded embankment. Facing the piercing north wind, our bodies are trembling, but our mouths are still shouting loudly, "Joining the army is good, joining the army is good, getting up early, sleeping early..." We are cold, but no one stops, and we hurry to our destination.

We all grit our teeth, hold the boxes in our hands, and stare at the vast river in front of us. Seven or eight small boats are slowly rowing towards us, getting closer and closer, and finally they all stop. Lao Guan, that interesting brother, takes out a fishing net and puts it into the water as if something is going to happen. Then, each boat puts down a net. But while their hands are holding the net, their eyes are staring ahead, and their right hands are also holding the trigger. These seven fishing boats that have put down their nets, a group of country folks in mismatched cloth gowns, are leisurely swaying in the river, but who knows what is in their hearts?

The wind blows on the water, creating slight waves. The sun has also put away its smiling face and is slowly setting in the west. But the river is still very quiet. Not to mention that the boat sending us gifts is not coming, even ordinary civilian boats are rare. As one minute and one second pass by, we become anxious. We are gnawing on dry, hard biscuits, and although our eyes are still staring ahead, they are already a little tired. Could the information we got be wrong? We are all thinking this.

The sun has tilted further west, and it is about to get dark, when we finally see a string of boats sailing towards us in the distance. Our already numb nerves are jolted again. As the boats get closer and closer, we can see the people inside clearly: there are a total of five boats, with three men with guns and two compatriots on each boat. They are pushing and pulling the boats forward with tears in their eyes.

The five boats are only two hundred meters away from us. The seven small fishing boats take up their nets and scatter to the sides to welcome them. On the shore, the seven disguised country folks also hide themselves, and everything returns to silence. The wind is still blowing furiously, creating waves on the water.

The five boats are getting closer and closer: one hundred meters, no, fifty meters.

"Bang!" A fishing boat opens fire. Then, the seven small net boats close in from all sides. We on the shore open our eyes, shake off our spirits, and point our fingers at the triggers, waiting for the opportunity to come. "Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang," the continuous sound of gunfire makes this group of "X Army" panic. They rush to raise their guns, return fire, and then rush to shrink their heads towards the bow of the boat. Before long, the five boats are in a state of disarray. But the seven small net boats are getting closer and closer, and the gunfire is slowly thinning out. We look into the distance and see that some have fallen and some are raising their hands. The plainclothes brothers have rolled onto their big boats one by one.

"Don't shoot, tell them to surrender," comes a voice from afar. Judging from the voice, it is Captain Zhang. It is already dark.

Li Squad Leader's boat slowly approaches the shore. The flashlight signal gathers us. Jumping on the boat, we learn that we have only received a boatload of gifts. Another boat has sunk with the people. At the same time, we have captured three "X Army" soldiers who were sending gifts. By the time we return to camp, it is already dark.

Occasionally, we find a woman's photo next to a guy. Undoubtedly, this is the family member who is looking forward to his return, but now, they may not know that he has become a ghost under our guns.

Of the four boats of gifts, three boats are horse feed. We are very ashamed that we have no horses and can only sink the boats. The remaining boat has rice, salt, and congratulatory "Long Live Military Fortune" cigarettes. Although we were busy all day, we did not come back empty-handed.

### Overview of the Newspaper Industry

— Yang Fei

——Reading "The Newspaper Industry in Modern China"

Newspapers have become an indispensable spiritual food for modern humans every day. Especially for high-level intellectuals, not reading the newspaper for a day is like missing a meal and feeling uncomfortable. Therefore, reading the newspaper is not only for entertainment, but mainly for enriching knowledge and absorbing spiritual nourishment.

In addition to reading the newspaper every day, if we can further explore the details of the newspaper industry, it can help us to understand the history of newspapers more deeply. It is just like people who love to read literary works often further study literary theory and creative experience, in order to be able to appreciate the content of the works more accurately.

"The Newspaper Industry in Modern China" (written by Zhao Junhao, sold by Shenbao Newspaper Office, priced at eight cents) is the latest published comprehensive book on the newspaper industry. It is not only suitable for those engaged in the newspaper industry to read, but also very suitable for those who study news knowledge to read.

This book has recently been reprinted. In addition to adding materials and rewriting the chapter "Wartime Interview" in the first edition, it also adds three chapters: "Newspaper Distribution," "Newspaper Management," and "News Legal System." It is said that the author has worked in the news industry for sixteen years, and has also held news lectures in several universities, and has published several newspapers and works. With his rich experience and profound knowledge, writing this book is naturally much better than similar books published in the past.

Now I will record the impressions after reading it carefully, selecting the main points:

The viewpoint is correct: He said that the elements of a newspaper are massization, education, modernization, and nationalization. The content of a newspaper... should take the interests of the masses as interests, and the right and wrong of the masses as right and wrong, and should not allow any private views to exist in it... The text should be valued for its simplicity, and the specialization should be based on conciseness... When selecting or editing manuscripts... good deeds should be publicized, and inferior descriptions should be reduced as much as possible... It should progress with the times, and should especially lead the masses to adapt to the times... On the one hand, the legacy of the old society should be eliminated, and on the other hand, it is necessary to strive for the mission of national independence and national integrity." These views, as well as the explanations on other theoretical and practical issues, are all very correct. Moreover, they are also applicable to other cultural departments.

Rich materials: All kinds of materials about the newspaper industry have been collected and discussed in this book. He uses the historical facts of the longitudinal evolution of the newspaper industry to demonstrate the various problems of the horizontal reform of the newspaper industry. Reading it makes people feel particularly appropriate and detailed, and full of interest. For example, the chapter "Improvement of Editing" is divided into five sections: "Editing Process," "Headline Research," "Interspersed Pictures," "Layout Innovation," and "Reference Materials." It is truly detailed and thorough. Especially articles such as "Wartime Interview," "New Broadcasting," and "Tabloids and Small Newspapers" have not been mentioned in other similar books. This book quotes many of the latest materials and inserts a lot of pictures with historical value. It can truly be said that it has come from behind and covered up all similar attempts.

Relevant to reality: In this book, in addition to the tracing of the history of the newspaper industry, the analysis of the situation, and the exposition of the theory, the most noteworthy thing is the actual revelation. It is not just a book for research, but a book that focuses on the practice of improving the newspaper industry. Among them, the various methods discussed in the chapters "Enrichment of Internal Research," "Improvement of Editing," "News Interview," and "Wartime Interview" are not only essential for news reporters to know in detail, but also should be understood by authors, and scholars in literature, history, social sciences, and other fields.

I think there must be many people who care about reading newspapers who always want to further study the newspaper industry in order to understand the causes and development of newspapers. Then, this book "The Newspaper Industry in Modern China" is the most worth reading.

Finally, I hope that when the third edition of this book is published, it will add materials on "special newspapers" - such as children's newspapers, youth newspapers, industry and commerce newspapers, and national salvation newspapers - and "wall newspapers," so that this book can become a more complete "overview of the newspaper industry."

### The American WPA Art Movement (Part 2)

— Bai Ying

As for the location of the performances, the places are also very complex and numerous. In addition to ordinary theaters, awnings, schools, taverns, squares, etc. are used as performance places, and each group arranges and equips itself at the lowest cost.

The number of viewers in a year is estimated at 15 million, of which one-third are the viewing class that began with actual performances.

It must be said that FTP is a new movement in theater in terms of the form and experimental performances of new plays. They have tried to perform classical plays in a modern style, especially like the play "Settha" which was performed in modern costumes, which is very noteworthy.

The play "It Can't Happen Here" by Lewis and Sinclair has always been rejected by general commercial theaters, but through the relationship of FTA, it was performed in twenty-seven cities in the United States, with an audience of 300,000 people. In addition, there are many performances of famous works, which cannot be listed here one by one. Recently, it is also preparing to stage dramas related to American agricultural policy, labor, electricity, and other issues.

FWP and FMP Activities - Regarding the field of literature, each state is compiling reports based on multi-faceted investigations. According to what is already known, there is the "WPA Poets Selection" published by the Poetry Society and the New Series.

Of course, in the field of poetry, there is no direct relationship with the WPA's direct business. Some of these poets are the editors of the "Commercial Vernacular Dictionary" in WAP editing, some are consultants on black issues, or compilers of historical records, and supervisors of adult education, etc.

As for the field of music, according to the "Yearbook" music section published last year, the performances of Mussorgsky's "Boris Godunov" and other musical pieces under the direction of Jack Samuelsd in Los Angeles were very successful. In addition, works by Fordan and Wagner have also been performed, such as the "Sibiani" overture, E major symphony, etc., which lasted for three days. It is said to have achieved rare success.

The WAP art movement started in 1935, but in these short four years, this movement has developed from a simple unemployment relief movement to a cultural movement of the American federal government. This is of course due to the government's wise leadership and the assistance of the national treasury, but the efforts of American cultural figures are still the biggest factor in the success of this movement.

### Snow Cloud

— Liu Lan

Snow · Blood

The snowdrift is scattered with spots of blood. Tonight, capturing last night's dream, I remember this scene.

The hand of memory searches more towards the past, revealing the curtain of childhood: after the snow cleared, I went to the forest with my third uncle to hunt wild rabbits. One shot hit, and bright red blood dripped on the snow. That scene is exactly the same as the dream scene last night.

Recalling these things, a burst of disappointment struck my heart like lightning. Ah, precious childhood, where did you flow to?

Is my third uncle, who lives on the Kanto prairie, still safe and sound? What is the fate of the hunting gun? Has my third uncle used it to hunt enemies? The motherland has been shaking for more than a year, what about Kanto? Are there gathered fighters in the mountains?

It is the season of snowflakes again. What is scattered on the snowdrift is no longer the blood of wild rabbits, but the blood of Guan Qi. Nourishing the frozen earth, it will sprout flowers of freedom and victory in the spring.

Sea · Cloud

The sea roared, shattering the calm moon on the sea. It hates the docile and obedient moon. The sea waves rolled, and the silver flowers were broken, as if to sink into the bottom of the sea.

Clouds rushed from an unknown distance, filling the sky, engulfing the moon. The earth was pitch black, covering the surging sea.

The night wind blew up the sorrow of the dark clouds, and wept - the heavy rain came.

The sky tore the lightning, and the bright light shone on the crazy sea. The waves seemed to want to destroy the world, and the earth shook.

Tomorrow is the seventh anniversary of the "January 28th" Songhu War of Resistance. All sectors of this city have decided to solemnly commemorate it in accordance with the measures stipulated by the Municipal Party Headquarters. The Japanese side fears attacks by guerrillas and has implemented security measures. The authorities of both concessions have also temporarily stepped up their defenses. The details are as follows:

Citywide Flags at Half-Mast, Entertainment Suspended

All sectors of this city, considering that tomorrow is the seventh anniversary of the "January 28th" Songhu War of Resistance, and at a time when the full-scale war of resistance has entered its second stage, will commemorate the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country and the compatriots who suffered. This will increase vigilance. Therefore, it has been decided to follow the commemorative measures stipulated by the Municipal Party Headquarters. All companies, shops, households, etc., in the city will fly flags at half-mast for one day. At 12 noon, everyone will stand silently in place for three minutes to express their grief. All entertainment venues in the city, including dance halls, Peking opera theaters, cinemas, and large and small amusement parks, will voluntarily close for one day to express condolences to the fallen soldiers and the compatriots who suffered, and to demonstrate the enthusiastic spirit of the people in the occupied areas in loving the country and supporting the war of resistance.

Charity Sales by Shops, Savings Donated

All major shops in this city are responding to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters' proposal for charity sales and donations. They will donate all the profits earned on that day to the bank and present them to the government for the purpose of providing relief to refugees. The implementation measures for this have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Currently, trade associations in various industries in this city are enthusiastically participating, and it is expected that the results of this donation will be astonishing.

Cultural Circles Donate 2,000 Yuan

The Shanghai Cultural Circles Revitalization League has donated 2,000 yuan to the government for the seventh anniversary of the "January 28th" incident. The letter from the League to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and the telegram to the Central Government are recorded as follows: (Letter to the Municipal Party Headquarters) Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters: We have read in the newspaper that your association has notified the public to hold a donation campaign on the anniversary of the January 28th War of Resistance to promote the patriotic enthusiasm of the people in our occupied areas, to deal a spiritual blow to the enemy, and to strive for the final victory of our war of resistance. The significance is profound, and we deeply admire it. Although our association was established not long ago, we are always mindful of resisting aggression and saving the country, and revitalizing the nation. We now respectfully donate 2,000 yuan, which has been entrusted to the bank to be remitted to the Central Government. We hereby inform you as a way to advocate and deeply hope that all sectors of the city will rise up together. Shanghai Cultural Circles Revitalization League (Telegram to the Central Government) To Chairman Lin of the Chongqing National Government and Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission: On the occasion of the seventh anniversary of the January 28th Songhu War of Resistance, the Shanghai Cultural Circles specially present 2,000 yuan to the government to comfort the soldiers fighting on the front lines. We respectfully ask for your acceptance. Shanghai Cultural Circles Revitalization League

Panic and Preparations by the Japanese Side

The Japanese puppet regime, fearing that the Chinese guerrillas would commemorate the war of resistance with practical actions, has been uneasy for days. The situation is quite panicky. They have increased the number of sentries in various places near the suburbs and are carefully guarding against attacks. Starting from the 25th, they have implemented a blockade of all ports on the north and south banks of the Yangtze River. Small-wheel traffic on the Suzhou Creek and the Southern Huangpu River has also been completely blockaded. The section from Dongmen Road to the Dadatou Wharf has been closed to boat traffic since the 24th, and walking along the Huangpu River is also prohibited. Wooden signs with "Announcement" have been erected on the road. In other places, such as the Japanese military police garrison on Lincoln Road in western Shanghai, fearing that guerrillas would take the opportunity to intercept them, more than 100 Japanese military policemen were temporarily transferred from the Hongkou District to cooperate with the troops of Bei-gang Gui-xiong of the Yi-fu Class to take charge of the defense of Zhongshan Road, Caoxi Road, Hongqiao Road, Lincoln Road, Bailinan Road, and other areas in western Shanghai. Temporary posts have been set up at intersections and key points to check pedestrians. Two armored vehicles are parked on Zhongshan Road for patrol purposes. The vehicles are covered with branches and grass, and the Japanese soldiers have bundles of straw tied to their heads, fearing bombing by our air force. Therefore, only the Zhipingyin Bridge can pass between the border of the Nanshi area and western Shanghai. As for the refugee area of Nanshi, only the old school grounds on Danfeng Road can be accessed. The Republic Road is completely blocked. Only Japanese military personnel are allowed to enter and exit the Xin Kaihe area.

Japanese Warships Stationed at Various Ports along the Yangtze River

Fearing attacks by guerrillas in various places, the Japanese side ordered all warships stationed in Shanghai to sail to various ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River for defense, strictly searching all foreign merchant ships entering and leaving. Therefore, when foreign merchant ships sailing to various ports pass through the Wusongkou gate and the Jiangmian area in recent days, more than a dozen armed Japanese navy personnel board the ships for inspection. Japanese puppet troops are also jointly conducting emergency security measures at ports such as Xupu, Baimao, Shiyiwei Port, Dongjie Port, Beisha, and Qinglong Port to prevent attacks.

The Concession Authorities Implement Preventive Measures

The police authorities of both concessions, considering that tomorrow is the anniversary of "January 28th," have decided to temporarily implement security measures to prevent accidents within the concessions. They have increased the number of detectives and patrol cars patrolling the streets and checking suspicious pedestrians. The security measures are even stricter in areas bordering the Chinese-controlled areas, such as Caojiadu in western Shanghai and Xujiahui, in order to maintain the peace of the concessions.

### Confirmation of the Sinking of the Kai Po Wheel; All Crew Members Rescued

The Accident Site Was Outside Haimen; Cargo Losses Reached More Than 500,000

The Kai Po wheel, chartered by the Ning Shao Commercial Company in this city from the Norwegian Hua Lun Shipping Company, has been confirmed to have sunk after hitting a reef in the Wai Diaoban waters near Haimen at 3:00 a.m. on the 24th. The loss of the ship and cargo is more than 500,000 yuan. All crew members escaped safely and arrived in Taiwan. They have already taken the Hai Fu transport ship to Shanghai and will arrive in port this afternoon. The details have been reported by the Xin Dai She reporter as follows:

Reef Collision Near Haimen Led to Sinking

The Kai Po wheel has a gross tonnage of 3,075 tons and was originally owned by the Hong Kong William Line. It was sold to the Norwegian Hua Lun Shipping Company at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Sichuan Road in Panama last November for more than 400,000 yuan. Recently, it was chartered by the Ning Shao Company on Duo-bo Road to run the Shanghai-Wenzhou-Ningbo line as a dedicated cargo ship. The ship loaded cotton yarn for the Ningbo Hefeng Yarn Factory on the morning of the 23rd of this month.

### The Crew Members Telegraphed that They Escaped Safely and Came to Shanghai

Since the ship was a dedicated cargo ship, there were no brokers. The captain was a Norwegian named Olsen, who previously worked on the Tang Lu wheel of the Hua Mei Company. He was recently transferred to serve as the captain of the Kai Po and was employed by the Hua Lun Shipping Company. The Ning Shao Company sent representatives Zhou Yan Yi and Zhang Yunquan, the affairs manager, to handle affairs. After the accident, all crew members were rescued and escaped safely, taking a fishing boat to Haimen. The Hua Lun Company received a telegram from Captain Olsen in Hai Dou yesterday at 12:00 noon, reporting that "The Kai Po hit a reef at Sheteng at 2:30 a.m. on the 25th and the ship sank. The crew is safe." The Ning Shao Company also received a telegram from Affairs Manager Zhang yesterday, reporting that "The Kai Po wheel hit a reef and sank in the Wai Diaoban at 3:00 a.m. on the 24th. All crew members escaped safely and are now on the Hai Fu wheel returning to Shanghai in Haimen." According to the Xin Dai She reporter's investigation, the Hai Fu transport ship left Taiwan yesterday at noon and will arrive in port this afternoon. The detailed circumstances of the Kai Po accident will be clarified after the ship's owner reports upon arrival in Shanghai.

Losses of Ship and Cargo Exceed 500,000

The Kai Po wheel is worth more than 400,000 yuan. This time, it loaded 2,561 tons of coal from Shanghai (according to reports, the ship had previously loaded 2,750 tons of coal), worth 100,000 yuan, for a total of more than 500,000 yuan. There were no other goods. The hull was insured for £15,000 by the Hua Lun Shipping Company with the British Royal Insurance Company's local representative, Renji Shipping Company. The cargo was insured for 120,000 yuan with the Siming Insurance Company. After the accident, the two companies notified their respective insurance companies. It is reported that the insurance companies have not yet received a report on the detailed circumstances of the accident. They need to wait for the ship's owner to return to Shanghai and inquire before sending personnel to investigate and survey in order to prepare for salvage efforts.

### British-Japanese Customs Agreement: Shanghai Banking Circles Deny Acceptance

Rumors Abound in the Securities Market; Uniform Bonds All See Price Declines

Since the Ministry of Finance announced that customs-guaranteed debts would no longer be allowed to be overdrawn and that the principal and interest of domestic public bonds would be repaid in Chongqing, the securities market in Shanghai has seen a decline in the prices of uniform bonds. Rumors have abounded in the market for days, causing the prices of all bonds to fall further. The market prices on January 15th and January 26th are recorded below. On January 16th, the uniform Class A bonds were 61.4 yuan, Class B bonds were 54.35 yuan, Class C bonds were 52.8 yuan, Class D bonds were 52 yuan, and Class E bonds were 52 yuan. On January 26th, the uniform Class A bonds were 55.55 yuan, Class B bonds were 48.65 yuan, Class C bonds were 47.5 yuan, Class D bonds were 46.5 yuan, and Class E bonds were 46.7 yuan. Comparing the two, there has been a uniform decline of 4 to 6 yuan. Regarding the rumors from Hong Kong that the Shanghai banking circles plan to telegraph the government to urge it to accept the British-Japanese Customs Agreement, the Xin Sheng She reporter interviewed a banking leader yesterday, who denied it. As for the customs duties in the occupied areas, such as Shanghai and Tianjin, they have long been transferred to the Yokohama Specie Bank. Although the British-Japanese Customs Agreement has been drafted, it has not yet been formally signed.
### The First Batch of Items for Participation in the American Exposition Have Been Shipped

Two Hundred and Fifty Crates of Handicrafts and Other Items; Jianghai Customs Exempts a Portion of the Tariffs

The first batch of items from local manufacturers participating in the American International Exposition was entrusted to the Changyu Company's Japanese Empress Wheel for shipment yesterday. The ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States at 11:30 a.m. today. The items to be shipped for participation include ivory, Hunan embroidery, silk fabrics, Du Jinsheng's brocades, Tianchu MSG, silks and satins, lama statues, lacquerware, handicrafts produced by Chinese national product manufacturers, small handicrafts, etc., totaling 250 crates. All national products to be participated in are intended for exhibition, and a portion is prepared for purchase by Americans. Therefore, the Jianghai Customs only collects tariffs on a portion of the items, and the other portion is exempt from tariffs. As for jadeite and jade articles, they will be shipped to the United States next time due to the delay in packing. They will be exhibited in the cement and steel-reinforced tower in "China Village" in the future to ensure safety. The Shanghai representatives are traveling to the United States on the Japanese Empress Wheel with the goods. The representatives from South China participating in the exposition, except for a few who have advanced to the United States, will board the ship when the Empress Wheel arrives in Hong Kong.

### British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Will Go North Tomorrow

To Inspect the Condition of British Nationals in North China

British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, in order to inspect the current situation of British nationals in North China and handle necessary affairs, is scheduled to go north by ship on the 28th of this month (tomorrow), traveling to Tianjin and then to Ping. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai in half a month, staying in Ping for at most one week. Other than this, there are no other tasks.

### Japanese Side Denies Exclusion of Foreign Merchants in Hankou

Says Relevant Denials Have Been Delivered to Foreign Embassies in Various Places

Xin Sheng She reports that the rumors circulating in this city that foreign merchants in Hankou will have their shops closed by the Japanese authorities if they leave Hankou, and that the ban on foreign merchants transporting property and exporting goods will be lifted if they stay, have been denied by the Japanese military authorities. It is said that these denials have been delivered to foreign embassies by the Japanese authorities in South China.

### Japanese Laying Mines in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River

The Japanese military authorities recently reported to the foreign navigation industry that they had laid as many as 150 mines in the Pearl River basin last month, 10 of which were placed near Humen on Tuesday. A number of mines have also recently been laid in the Yangtze River area downstream of Hankou.

### Japanese Exporting Large Quantities of Rice

The price of rice in this city has been increasing daily in the past week. According to rice industry sources, the reason for the high rice prices is that a certain party has recently been packaging large quantities for export. Rice produced in the guerrilla areas is completely controlled and transported by the Japanese, amounting to more than one million dan, so although the source has not been cut off, rice merchants have no way to purchase it. The concession authorities are paying close attention to this.

### Using Native Products to Replenish Foreign Exchange Funds; Flourishing Exports from Hong Kong

Successful Trade Control by the Ministry of Finance; Particularly Large Exports of Native Products Last Year

After the successful implementation of trade control by the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance, it has been vigorously promoting the export of native products to replenish foreign exchange funds.

### Customs Officials Are Passionately Patriotic; The Integrity of Customs Sovereignty

Retired Customs Officials Cannot Bear to Accept Foreign Exchange Profits; Import and Export Customs Declarations Have Not Been Changed to Use Japanese - Special Interview with This Newspaper

Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, some customs offices in the north and south have fallen into special circumstances due to changes in the Chinese positions. The government is very concerned about customs sovereignty and administration and is planning improvements. The details are as follows:

Sovereignty and Administration Remain Intact

The Inspector General of Customs, Mr. Maze, handles all customs administration in accordance with the orders of the central government. Therefore, although some customs offices have special circumstances, sovereignty and administration remain intact. Previously, some customs officials, motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, requested the Military Affairs Commission to rectify discipline in the customs offices and strive for efficiency. The Military Affairs Commission approved the request and handed it over to the Ministry of Finance for review. The customs authorities also believed that in the face of national crisis, civil servants should strive to be diligent, thrifty, and patriotic, and immediately ordered their subordinates to strictly comply.

Pension Funds Are All Changed to Purchase Foreign Exchange

Customs officials are entitled to a pension, which is paid upon retirement, and the amount is considerable. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the customs authorities changed the practice of purchasing public bonds for the monthly pension savings of customs officials to purchasing foreign exchange. In the past year, due to the rise in foreign exchange rates, all officials who were due to receive retirement pensions received almost double the amount they would have received before the war due to the increase in prices after purchasing foreign exchange. However, this kind of foreign exchange gain is purely a wartime profit, and the retired customs officials believed that this profit would indirectly increase the country's foreign exchange expenditure. Many have submitted statements to the central government, stating that since they are national civil servants, and at a time when the war is ongoing and civil servants in various provinces are mostly paid reduced salaries, retired customs officials cannot bear to receive this additional benefit from foreign exchange. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance is investigating the opinions of retired customs officials and will make a decision on how to handle the matter.

Regulations on Housing Allowances Strictly Prohibit False Reporting

Customs officials are entitled to various allowances, such as rent subsidies, which are paid in addition to their monthly salaries. The regulations have always been very strict. Higher-level officials receive approximately 50 yuan per month, but it is based on actual expenses and reimbursement, with 50 yuan as the limit. Not long ago, a customs official reported a rent of 50 yuan for a residence that cost only 20 yuan. When the Inspector General learned of this, he ordered the official's dismissal for falsely reporting expenses and issued a notice to all customs offices to thoroughly investigate the rent subsidies of customs officials, ensuring accuracy and strictly prohibiting false reporting. If any false reporting is found, the official will be immediately dismissed.

The Number of Japanese Customs Officials Has Increased Significantly

Since the Jianghai Customs duties were sent to the central government last July, they have not been remitted since. Inspector General Maze has reported this situation to the Ministry of Finance. Regarding the recent administrative situation of the customs office, the number of foreign employees of Japanese nationality has increased significantly, and this is mostly due to current needs. It is generally believed that this is a special situation for a short period, and that the situation will return to normal after some time. As for import and export customs declarations, Japanese merchants have recently requested that Japanese be added to the forms. The customs authorities have not considered this request because the declarations have always been in Chinese and English.

### Jewish Refugees in Harbin Forced to Serve the Japanese

Forced to Provide Labor

According to Kaufmen, chairman of the Far Eastern Jewish Association protected by the Japanese, Jewish refugees who came to North China from Central Europe are now under the control of the Japanese. All Jewish refugees living in Harbin and other places in "Manchukuo" are forcibly organized into Jewish People's Associations to help the Japanese manage affairs in North China. Together with the White Russian Anti-Communist Alliance, they serve as the Japanese's pawns. The Jewish People's Association that will be used by them has been established in Harbin.

### Partnership Agreements Should Be Stamped

After the abnormal development of commerce in this city, various forms of joint venture organizations have emerged in response to the times. The documents for these joint ventures are often hastily drafted and not stamped, failing to meet the legal requirements. As a result, occasional disputes can have a significant impact when litigated in court. It has been found that documents for joint ventures, regardless of whether they are called contracts, articles of association, agreements, stocks, salaries, or account books, should be stamped in accordance with Article 18 of the Stamp Tax Law Rate Table and the Temporary Measures of the Stamp Tax Law during the Emergency Period. Each document should be stamped at a rate of 4 fen per 100 yuan of the amount involved. Any excess amount less than 100 yuan should also be counted as 100 yuan. For example, a joint venture document for 5,550 yuan should be stamped with 2 yuan and 24 fen if there is only one general agreement document. If each person holds one copy, each copy held by each person should be stamped according to the amount of their investment. For example, if a joint venture of 5,550 yuan is invested by four people (A, B, C, and D), and there are four agreement documents, A invests 3,000 yuan, and their agreement document should be stamped with 1 yuan and 20 fen. B invests 2,200 yuan, and their agreement document should be stamped with 88 fen. C invests 200 yuan, and their agreement document should be stamped with 8 fen. D invests 150 yuan, and their agreement document should also be stamped with 8 fen. The total stamp duty for the four agreement documents should be 2 yuan and 24 fen. Stamping in accordance with the above method is legal.

### Orphanage for Refugee Children's Six-Year Education Plan

Radio Fundraiser Launched Yesterday; Held at the Sino-Western Electric Company Today

The Shanghai Relief Association for Refugee Children in this city held a radio publicity meeting yesterday at the Guohua Radio Station to raise funds for the construction of orphanage buildings. Mr. Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the orphanage's board of directors, delivered the opening speech, saying, "Listeners, today our orphanage is holding a radio publicity meeting on this station. The purpose is to raise funds for building orphanage buildings. We are deeply grateful to the entire Guangyu Society for mobilizing to come to our association to serve and plead for the orphans. Since the establishment of our orphanage, we have achieved today's results entirely thanks to the directors and adoptive benefactors. At the same time, we are grateful to the entertainment industry for their vigorous publicity and the generous donations from all sectors, which have allowed us to take in 200 orphans. However, the orphanage buildings are very small and the air is poor. All kinds of facilities, such as workshops, hospitals, and playgrounds, cannot be established. Therefore, we need complete orphanage buildings in order to complete our mission. Today, during the radio broadcast, we would like to ask everyone to continue to support us. As for the plan set by our orphanage, we have a six-year education slogan. During these six years, we will teach them to read and provide them with technical skills so that they will have the ability to be self-reliant and will not drift into a homeless situation after completing the six-year period. We hope that all listeners will fulfill their national duties and enthusiastically support us." Chen Jicheng and Zhou Bangjun also delivered speeches successively. The event will be held at the Sino-Western Electric Company starting at 12:00 noon today.

### Investigation of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Salary Increase; Western Taxpayers Provide Information

Business Community Representatives Investigative Committee; Mr. Seidel and Three Others Are Present

The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports that the Business Community Representatives Investigative Committee, investigating the Shanghai Municipal Council's salary increase, is working hard. A meeting will be held at 4:15 p.m. today (the 26th). Instead of diligently studying the documents provided by the Shanghai Municipal Council or listening to the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Personnel Committee, Western taxpayers such as Mr. Seidel and three others will be present to provide the committee with information that is not easily obtained from official documents and to elaborate on it. As for the business representatives, it is still unknown what kind of information they have obtained from other sources besides the information provided by the Bureau. However, they have not undertaken any arrangements to obtain contacts other than letters from other related parties. The Committee may give the Bureau's employees an opportunity to express their opinions, but no one knows for sure.

### Ministry of Finance Telegraphed Shanghai to Commend Silver and Money Industries for Promoting Income Tax

In order to Effectively Promote Increasing Tax Revenues; Strengthening Staff and Improving Tax Returns

Since the implementation of income tax in October of the 25th year, it has been very smooth due to the good tax system and fair burden. However, with the gradual expansion of the war zones, the assets of industrial and commercial enterprises have been destroyed, which will inevitably affect the micro-taxation of profit income. In order to effectively promote good taxes and increase tax revenues, the Ministry of Finance is strengthening the staff in the rear and improving tax returns, ordering all provinces to step up supervision and collection in order to enrich the national treasury. The Xin Sheng She reporter learned from the silver and money industries yesterday that since the fall of Shanghai, various banks and money shops have continued to deduct and pay income tax on behalf of the government to the designated agencies. The Shanghai Income Tax Office has received instructions from the Ministry to highly commend various banks and money shops for promoting income tax and has instructed the silver and money industries' association to inform its member banks and money shops.

### The Citizens' Group of the Relief Association Held a Team Leader Meeting Yesterday

Broadcasting Fundraiser Statistics Completed; Totaled More Than 160,000 Yuan

The Fundraising Committee of the Citizens' Group of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held a general team leader meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Association at 2:00 p.m. yesterday and reported the results of the first fundraising. The details are as follows:

Chairman's Report

A total of more than 300 people attended yesterday's general team leader meeting, including representatives from the association Xu Jilu, Yuan Ludeng, Fang Jiaobo, and team leaders Lin Kanghou and Wang Lianfang. First, Chairman Lin Kanghou reported, saying, "We are deeply grateful to the leaders from all sectors for their enthusiastic participation and joint efforts in the fundraising work of our association. The donations during the broadcast period have now been counted, and it has been determined that a total of 8,523 refugees have been adopted. The amount of donations received is 93,985.417 yuan, and the amount of donations outstanding is 74,944.50 yuan, for a total of 168,929.917 yuan."

### The Detention of Bandits by Japanese Troops: Four Bandits Escape Yesterday

The failure to promptly return them to the police station led to this incident. The police authorities are planning appropriate responses.

On the 4th of this month, the Public Concession Police Reserve Team, along with a large team of detectives from the General Police Station, went to a thatched shed near the 200-yard creek west of Columbia Road to search for bandits. At that time, both sides exchanged gunfire multiple times. Due to being outnumbered, the bandits abandoned their weapons in the creek and were captured. The bandits were then taken away by the Japanese military police and detained at the Japanese military police headquarters at 94 Jessfield Road. The next afternoon, the Japanese side handed them over to the Public Concession Police authorities for interrogation, with an agreement to return them to the Japanese side within 24 hours. After interrogating the bandits, the police learned that they had recently committed several serious crimes in the road-building area outside the western district of Shanghai, including an incident several weeks ago on Brenan Road where they attacked two Chinese police officers and seized their handguns. Later, based on their confessions, the police captured several of their accomplices in the Great Western Road and Jessfield Village area. Yesterday, the Japanese military police informed the Jing'an Temple Road police station that four of the bandits, who were detained at the "Great Road Police Headquarters Prison" at 92 Jessfield Road (next door to the Japanese military police headquarters), had suddenly escaped from prison on Wednesday morning. However, the details are still unknown. It is rumored that the police authorities are planning appropriate responses.

Discussion of Various Cases

It was decided that the Chairman of the Association, Xu Jilong, Secretary-General Yuan Lvdeng, and the main fundraiser, Fang Jiaobo, would successively give speeches and guidance. Then, various cases were discussed: (1) Establishing the organizational outline of the fundraising team; (2) Establishing the reward measures for the fundraising team; (3) Setting February 10th as the second deadline for payment; (4) Councilor Ying Yongyu's suggestion of a "One-Day Citizen Disaster Relief Movement" and Committee Member Zhu Qizhen's suggestion of adding a surcharge to telephone bills were both referred to the Standing Committee for deliberation.

Initial Payment Results

The association held its first payment collection yesterday, which was quite enthusiastic. The totals were: General Captain Lin Kanghou 2613 yuan, First Team 796 yuan, Second Team 600 yuan, Third Team 1702 yuan, Fourth Team 282 yuan, Fifth Team 124 yuan, Sixth Team 3325 yuan, Seventh Team 306 yuan, Eighth Team 322 yuan, Tenth Team 666 yuan, Eleventh Team 712 yuan, Twelfth Team 893 yuan, Thirteenth Team 2750 yuan, Fifteenth Team 300 yuan, Seventeenth Team 170 yuan, Eighteenth Team 948 yuan, Twentieth Team 30 yuan, Twenty-first Team 980 yuan, Twenty-third Team 500 yuan, Twenty-fourth Team 714 yuan, Twenty-fifth Team 402 yuan, Twenty-sixth Team 1200 yuan, Twenty-eighth Team 654 yuan, Thirtieth Team 10 yuan, Thirty-first Team 460 yuan, Thirty-third Team 214 yuan, Thirty-seventh Team 26 yuan, Thirty-eighth Team 300 yuan, Forty-fourth Team 240 yuan, Forty-sixth Team 200 yuan, Forty-eighth Team 824 yuan, Forty-ninth Team 78 yuan, Fifty-first Team 900 yuan, Fifty-third Team 524 yuan, Fifty-sixth Team 126 yuan, Fifty-ninth Team 200 yuan, Sixty-first Team 2106 yuan, Sixty-fourth Team 1772 yuan, Sixty-fifth Team 442 yuan, Sixty-sixth Team 70 yuan, Sixty-eighth Team 140 yuan, Sixty-ninth Team 24 yuan, Seventy-second Team 123 yuan, Seventy-eighth Team 0 yuan, Seventy-ninth Team 200 yuan, Eighty-seventh Team 50 yuan, Ninety-eighth Team 100 yuan, One Hundred Eleventh Team 24 yuan, One Hundred Twelfth Team 658 yuan, One Hundred Thirteenth Team 498 yuan, One Hundred Nineteenth Team 3600 yuan, One Hundred Twenty-first Team 134 yuan, One Hundred Twenty-second Team 2237 yuan. The total amount collected by all teams was 37,581 yuan.

Shaoxing Compatriots

The Shaoxing natives in Shanghai, in response to the invitation from the Disaster Relief Association's compatriots group to organize a fundraising association and participate in the work, specially convened a temporary meeting yesterday to discuss the organization of a fundraising team and begin the work. Liu Zhifang was immediately elected as the general captain, Tao Yichang and Huang Yantang as the deputy general captains, and Zhang Tianjue as the staff member to attend the association and participate in the work. In order to carry out fundraising separately, it was decided to form forty sub-teams, and Zhang Zonghan was immediately elected as the sub-team leader.

New Paradise

Li Ze, the deputy director of the compatriots group's fundraising committee, raised 110 yuan from the New New Company's Children's Amusement Park. This was because the amusement park held a purchase lottery last month and stipulated that half of the prize money would be transferred to the donation for disaster relief for children. The lottery has now ended, and the donation of 110 yuan has been submitted to the compatriots group.

Soliciting Cigarette Tins

Since the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's compatriots group's light fundraising committee advocated the simple living disaster relief movement, it has been actively proceeding. In order to save waste and ensure that refugees receive more practical benefits, from now on, it is specifically soliciting donations of old cigarette tins from all walks of life, regardless of the quantity, are welcome. However, they must have a lid and not be damaged. Those who are enthusiastic to donate can send them directly to the office of the group at the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, 16 Longmen Road.

A Heartwarming Act

Mr. Shen Yaohai's father, a monk, was serving as a sailor in Ningbo and died in a shipwreck. Friends and relatives raised money to help Shen's mother for her livelihood. Now that Shen has become self-sufficient, his mother recently passed away, and he immediately transferred the remaining 326 yuan from the relief funds received from friends and relatives to the Disaster Relief Association to benefit the disaster victims. The association admired Shen's actions and has prepared a thank-you note.

### The Zhejiang Authorities Plan to Establish a Monopoly Bureau to Control Cargo Transportation on the Ou and Yong Rivers

Encouraging and approving various ships to join the guild and selecting sailing dates to arrange the order.

Wenzhou and Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang are the only navigable ports after the war. The export of local products from the interior and the import of foreign goods are both transshipped through these two ports. The Zhejiang Provincial Government plans to establish a monopoly bureau to control cargo transportation and develop transportation efficiency. At the same time, it will carry out land-sea joint transportation with Jiangxi, Fujian, and Hunan provinces. The details are as follows.

Sharp Increase in Cargo at Ningbo and Ou Ports

After the war, the cargo entering and leaving the ports of Wenzhou and Ningbo increased sharply. The original customs houses increased the number of customs officers to provide services, and the tax revenue increased accordingly. For example, last year the value of goods imported by Wenzhou Customs was 1,923,000 national currency, and the value of exported goods was 6,240,000 national currency. The value of goods imported by Ningbo Customs was 1,212,000 national currency, and the value of exported goods was 4,768,000 national currency. The increase in exports set a new record for the two customs houses. In the previous year, Ningbo Customs only exported 26,000 yuan, and Wenzhou Customs only exported 541,000 yuan.

Planning to Establish a Monopoly Bureau to Control Cargo Transportation

The Zhejiang Provincial Government, considering that Wenzhou and Ningbo have become important ports for the import and export of goods from various inland provinces, resulting in a limited number of ships, has led to a situation where supply cannot meet demand. Shipowners raise prices arbitrarily, and merchants feel particularly pained. Now, in order to regulate the social economy and dredge cargo transportation, the Department of Finance has planned to establish a monopoly bureau to control cargo transportation on the Ou and Yong Rivers, which can also increase provincial revenue and develop transportation efficiency.

Land-Sea Joint Transportation Has Been Implemented

Zhejiang, Fujian, Hunan, Guangxi and other provinces have already implemented land-sea joint transportation. The highways of the above provinces have been interconnected. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been connected with the Yuehan Railway. The first section of the Hunan-Guangxi Railway has been completed and opened to traffic. Therefore, the main local products of various provinces are transported to Hong Kong or Shanghai, and the necessary imports of foreign goods are transshipped through the ports of Ningbo and Wenzhou. The Tenth Group Army Headquarters has approved various foreign ships to sail to Ningbo-Wenzhou Port and Ningbo-Wenzhou-Shanghai routes, aiming to promote the export of local products from the inland.

Shipping Guild Contributes Opinions

The Ningbo Shipping Guild has decided to petition military, police, and political organs, contribute opinions on navigation, and request adoption, so as not to hinder the military affairs of the war of resistance, and to seek the welfare of the people and shipping merchants. For the 48 foreign ships on the 17 routes approved by the General Headquarters, those who are not members of the guild are encouraged to join, and each should choose a sailing date to arrange the order of import and export.

### Japanese Motorboat Rams a Ferryboat on the Opposite Bank

Recently, Japanese motorboats sailing from the lower reaches of the Huangpu River to the south bank of the Huangpu River to supply the Japanese army with military supplies and provisions have been quite busy, indicating that the situation in the upper reaches of the Huangpu River is quite serious. At 8:20 yesterday morning, a Japanese wooden motorboat, No. 205, passed near the blockade line of the 16th Pier. Due to speeding, it suddenly rammed a ferryboat on Dongchang Road, capsizing the entire boat with eight passengers and two boatmen, all of whom fell into the river. Nearby boats rushed to the rescue, but due to the chaotic order, it is unknown whether there were any drowning deaths. The rescued people were all sent to Pudong, where they were frozen pale due to the cold weather. The Japanese boat that caused the disaster sped away towards the south bank of the Huangpu River.

### The Ministry of Economic Affairs Rewards the Invention of Electrical Wiring Boxes

Invented by the Central Electromagnetic Factory, it can save one screw.

The Industrial Technology Review Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government, based on the application submitted by Ren Guochang of the Central Porcelain Factory, requested a ten-year patent for the invention of various wiring boxes, round fuse boxes, and copper parts for other similar electrical materials. After review, the connecting part of the copper part and the porcelain part is crimped by a hand press with a wiring pliers tube. This method of crimping the copper tube can make one thing serve two purposes, saving a screw compared to ordinary screw connections. The structure is novel and practical, and a five-year patent is granted.

### 1938 Shanghai Municipal Council Industrial Report (Continued)

The annual index for miscellaneous items was 164.20, an increase of 27.5% compared to July (128.83). The monthly index was lowest in January (157.07) and highest in October (169.28). The annual index for food was 129.47, an increase of 27.3% compared to July (101.72). The monthly index was lowest in November (118.43) and highest in February (138.33). The annual index for clothing was 126.54, an increase of 12.4% compared to July (112.56). The monthly index was lowest in June (117.18) and highest in November (139.45). As for the total index for each month of 1938, it was lowest in May (154.49) and highest in August (167.12). The total annual index was 160.60, an increase of 46.7% compared to July (109.51). Therefore, the general cost of living, which cost one yuan in July before the war, now requires one yuan and forty-seven cents in 1938.

(4) (The Purchasing Power of Money in 1938) Although prices and the purchasing power of money have different names, they actually refer to the same problem, only viewed from two different aspects. When prices rise, the purchasing power of money falls; when prices fall, the purchasing power of money rises. Prices and the purchasing power of money are inversely proportional. This rises and that falls, and the trends are opposite. To give an example, if the total index of 109.51 in July 1937 (1926 equals 100) is used as a comparison standard, then the total index and its reciprocal should both be counted as 100 in that month. The total index of 160.60 in 1938 (1926 equals 100) should be counted as 146.65 (July 1937 equals 100), and its reciprocal is 68.19. 68.19 is the purchasing power of one yuan of national currency in 1938. In other words, the true value of one yuan of national currency in 1938 is only equal to six jiao, eight fen, one li and nine hao of the currency value in July 1937.

(5) (Retail Prices in 1938) Comparing the retail prices of individual commodities in 1938 with those in July 1937 before the war, the increase in rent was the largest. The increase was 163% for bungalows, 158% for Western-style buildings, and 143% for shikumen buildings. Among the fuel category, the price of charcoal increased by 118%, waste firewood by 100%, firewood by 96%, and coal briquettes by 77%. Among the food category, the increase in vegetables was the most drastic. Spinach increased by 247%, salted mustard greens by 174%, chives by 145%, green vegetables by 123%, and foreign potatoes by 106%. The increase in meat and eggs was slightly less, with beef increasing by 93%, chicken by 91%, and fresh duck eggs by 67%. Among soy products, tofu and dried tofu each increased by 48%. Among rice and flour products, indica rice increased by 26% and japonica rice by less than 10%. Among miscellaneous items, straw paper increased by 88%, yellow wine by 58%, and soap by 35%. Among clothing items, native cloth increased by 39%, striped cloth by 31%, and woolen cloth by 19%.

(6) (Wage Rates) The above table lists each industry according to the height of the hourly wage rate from 1930 to 1938. The wage figures for the shipbuilding and match industries in 1937 and 1938 are missing. After the August 13th Incident, the factories of these two industries were completely destroyed, and the few remaining were also in the war zone, so there was no way to investigate, and they had to be omitted. Among the industries, shipbuilding, printing, and machinery industries had the highest wages, with an average hourly wage rate of about one jiao. The wages of silk reeling and cotton spinning workers were the lowest, with an hourly wage rate of only three to four fen. Cotton spinning is the largest manufacturing industry in Shanghai, and wages are extremely meager.

Reordering the various industries according to the height of the monthly actual income, the shipbuilding, printing, and machinery industries still rank first, with monthly incomes ranging from 23.08 yuan to 47.63 yuan. The actual income of silk reeling and match workers is the lowest, ranging from 6.31 yuan to 11.39 yuan per month. With such low incomes, the hardship of life is evident even in peacetime.

### A Special Shanghai Feature: Retrospect and Prospect of Accounting Studies and Accounting Profession in China (Continued)

— Pan Xulun

As for government accounting, after the establishment of the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounting and Statistics (DGBAS) of the National Government, it promoted a detached accounting system. It successively established the Central Unified Accounting System and promulgated the Accounting Law. The central government agencies and provincial and municipal governments also gradually adopted new systems. Although the performance of implementation in various aspects still lacks areas that fail to fully meet expectations, the progress compared to the Beiyang Government era is incomparable. In terms of transportation, such as the revision of the telecommunications accounting system, the improvement of postal accounting, and the research on railway accounting, there have also been important advancements. Other items such as the national electrical and highway unified accounting systems drafted by the central competent authority have also played an important role in promoting accounting.

At the same time, Mr. Xu Yongzuo's advocacy of improving Chinese-style bookkeeping has also had a considerable impact on the improvement of accounting in old-style commercial enterprises in China. In 1934, Mr. Xu Yongzuo believed that old-style businessmen in China who were not familiar with new-style bookkeeping found it difficult to change the concept of receipts and payments into the concept of debit and credit, and those who were accustomed to writing vertically with a brush found it difficult to change to writing horizontally with a pen. Therefore, he proposed to improve the old-style bookkeeping and apply it directly, instead of immediately changing Chinese-style bookkeeping to Western-style bookkeeping. Mr. Xu advocated that old-style stores wishing to change from old-style bookkeeping to new-style bookkeeping could find a shortcut. New-style manufacturers had better management methods than old-style manufacturers, and many secretaries and accounting personnel who were accustomed to applying old-style bookkeeping also followed suit, with considerable success.

As the use of new-style accounting became more and more widespread, the research of accounting studies became more and more in-depth. In the past ten years, the content of accounting translations has not been limited to bookkeeping and elementary accounting. There have been many good books on specialized accounting such as cost accounting, advanced accounting, auditing, analysis of settlement statements, and income tax accounting. Moreover, in the previous period, the work of compiling and translating accounting focused on introduction. In the recent ten years, because the application of accounting has become widespread and the experience has become rich, the relationship between academic research and practical work has become increasingly close. Accounting studies are no longer entirely imported goods. The so-called "Chinese Accounting Studies" is gradually taking shape, such as Mr. Yong Jiayuan's "On Chinese Government Accounting," Mr. Gu Zhun's "Bank Accounting," and my book "Accounting for Joint Stock Limited Companies" are all prominent examples. As for the book "Compilation of Accounting Terms and Translations" compiled by my firm's colleagues, a revised edition was published this year, which should not lack contribution to the unification of accounting terms in China.

### Uncle and Niece Sleeping Together: Husband Reports and Arrests

Reportedly, the husband saw the money and allowed them to sleep together. A shameless couple sentenced to six months of imprisonment each.

Luo Suitu, a Shaoxing native who worked as a coal shop runner at No. 525 Henan Road, married a woman with the surname Shi from the same town. They originally lived in their hometown. In January of last year, people feared that the Japanese army would cross the river and invade Shaoxing, so they fled in droves. Luo's wife, Shi, then came to Shanghai with her cousin, Shi Yuande, from Shaoxing. Because Luo's income was low, the places he rented were all small. The room he currently rents at No. 4, Lane 60, Baker Road, is even

Only Has One Bed.

Yuande stayed at Luo's place, initially using a table as a bed. By last summer, because Luo stayed in the shop and did not often return home, Yuande took the opportunity to abandon the table and sleep in the bed with Shi. Luo only recently heard about this, so he suddenly returned home at dawn on the 24th and saw the uncle and niece sharing the same quilt. Ashamed and indignant, he was deeply concerned that publicizing it would affect his reputation, so he swallowed his anger and issued an eviction order. However, Yuande lingered and still

Slept Together as Uncle and Niece

The next morning at seven o'clock, Luo again caught them. Unable to tolerate it, he reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. The detective chief dispatched detectives to arrest the couple and found a love letter from Shi to Yuande. They were taken back to the police station for questioning. The two admitted to sleeping together without denying it. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Meng Tingke opened the court for preliminary hearing. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the case and stated that the two defendants had already

Confessed to Cohabitation

For a year and that the plaintiff also knew about it early. Shi's letter to Yuande contained the words "If I don't see Yuande occasionally, I can't eat." Now, a public prosecution is filed based on the crime of adultery, and it should be heard and dealt with, etc. He also presented the letter as evidence. Subsequently, after questioning the defendants in court, Luo Shi stated, "I am now 30 years old. Yuande is my cousin. This time, we fled to Shanghai together from Shaoxing. My nephew stayed at my house. After July, my husband asked me to take a photo with Yuande and allowed Yuande to share the bed. From then on,

Three People Slept

on one bed. My husband also secretly instructed me to observe Yuande carefully and to observe his blood (blood is a euphemism for money). If others occasionally gossip, he would not listen to it," etc. Shi Yuande also confessed that the three of them had been sharing the bed since July. At that time, Suitu was ill, so I paid for all the rent and living expenses. Although my pocket is tight, the manager of Yi Da Qianzhuang is my teacher, and I have wealthy relatives in Shanghai. I can go to them for loans and help the Luo family if I can get it. Now, Luo knows that my

Finances Are Exhausted

And does not want to keep me, so he reported it." However, Luo Suitu firmly denied that he had approved of his wife and Shi Yuande's illicit behavior beforehand, saying that no husband in the world would order his wife to commit adultery with others and allow it without interfering. Judge Meng reviewed the confessions and immediately sentenced Luo Shi and Shi Yuande to six months of imprisonment each. If they were to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it would be calculated at three yuan per day.

### A Rōnin Causes Trouble on Trolleybus No. 18

The driver's skill prevented a major disaster. Traffic was blocked, and the perpetrator was arrested and severely punished.

At around 8:00 PM last night, Trolleybus No. 154, operated by a French company, was traveling on Route 18 from Xieqiao to the North Railway Station. When it arrived at the Jialu Road stop on Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession, the driver, Yin Denggao from Yancheng, opened the door as usual. At that time, a young man in a Western suit, about twenty years old, who looked like a Japanese and was drunk, got on the bus and stood on the platform. The ticket seller, No. 46, was selling third-class tickets, waiting for passengers to get on and off, and rang the bell to start the bus. It had only traveled a few steps when the young man in the Western suit suddenly ordered the driver to stop so that he could get off. The driver was not allowed to open the door according to the rules, and the distance between Jialu Road Station and Nanyang Bridge Station was very short, so he ignored it. Unexpectedly, the young man who looked like a Japanese punched the driver in the left eye, causing him to lose his line of sight. The front of the bus had already swerved to the south. Fortunately, the driver was experienced and braked suddenly, preventing a disaster. Only the trolley pole on the roof of the bus came off, and the passengers in the car were in an uproar. The driver argued with him, but he remained strong and unreasonable. Then, the patrolmen arrived and tried to use force. However, at that time, there were many trolleybuses and other vehicles on various routes coming and going, and the crowd of onlookers blocked the road. The bully, seeing that the situation was not good, shouted in broken Mandarin on the trolleybus platform, "I am not Japanese, I am Korean!" Soon, the police station's riot car team arrived after receiving the news, inquired about the situation, and took the perpetrator to the police station. Traffic resumed, but it had been stopped for a quarter of an hour.

### Tram Collision at Jiangxi Road and Nanjing Road

At around 10:00 PM last night, a British-operated tram company's Route 17 trolleybus, traveling from North Sichuan Road, collided with a certain number tram at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Nanjing Road. Because the collision was very violent, the doors and windows of both vehicles were shattered, and several passengers in the cars were injured. The slightly injured passengers got out of the cars one after another and hired other vehicles to leave. Two passengers who were more seriously injured were called to an ambulance by Chinese police No. 285 and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The names of the injured were Wang Linbao (40 years old), a Ningbo native, injured in the waist, and a girl Wang Xiaoyang (8 years old), injured in the head. At that time, the two vehicles stopped in the middle of the road, and traffic was blocked for about ten minutes.

### Husband Fails a Grade; Young Wife Poisons Herself

Persuasion Ineffective, Ultimately Despairing of Life

Zhu Guixian, a young woman from Ningbo, was nineteen years old and lived with her husband, Mr. Dong, at No. 6 Xiude Lane, Baike Road, in the Public Concession. Mr. Dong was studying at a certain school on Jing'an Temple Road. After class, he often fooled around outside and neglected his studies. Recently, the school authorities, due to his poor conduct and failing grades, made him repeat a grade. Previously, Zhu Guixian had kindly tried to persuade him, but Mr. Dong not only didn't listen but also spoke harshly to his wife. Afterwards, Zhu Guixian was depressed all day. Yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, she suddenly had the thought of ending her life, swallowing a large amount of medicinal water to commit suicide. It wasn't until 11:00 PM that her family discovered it. They immediately rushed her to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, due to the extreme depth of the poisoning, the treatment was ineffective, and she soon passed away. The body was sent to the coroner's office for examination.

### Postman Steals and Opens Letters; Pilfering Checks Inside

Arrested at Yi Yuan Dog Racing Track; Many Crimes Committed, Detained for Further Questioning

Shi Aigen, a native of Ningbo, resided at No. 13 Hongyun Lane, Aiduya Road. He was formerly postman No. 792 at the Kader Road branch of the Postal Administration. In July of last year, Shi suddenly left his post without permission and disappeared. After an investigation by Cha Peilin, the Postmaster of the Postal Administration, it was discovered that Shi had embezzled registered letters and legal tender inside. Therefore, in the July edition of the reports, the Xinzha Police Station was informed, who in turn requested the First Special Court to issue an arrest warrant.

A warrant was issued. Until 6:30 PM the day before yesterday, Chen Lianjing, a Chinese detective inspector from the Xinzha Police Station, and detective Huang Yulin, learned that Shi was currently inside the Yi Yuan dog racing track in the French Concession. They went together with detectives from the French Concession Police Station and arrested Shi Aigen, bringing him back to the police station for investigation. It was learned that Shi had embezzled 1,500 yuan in legal tender.

Ordered to be Detained

Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First District Court. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, stated the case, prosecuting him for occupational embezzlement under Article 336, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, stating that the defendant was a post office postman. On February 14th of last year, there was a registered letter from New York, USA, addressed to

Zeng Ji, Huhan Company

Tang Yonghua, containing 200 yuan in national currency. And on April 16th of last year, there was another registered letter from Korea addressed to Yu Dehan of the Zhengzhang Laundry Company at No. 720 Fuxu Road, containing 900 Hong Kong dollars. In total, 1,300 Shanghai dollars were privately opened by the defendant, who stole the checks inside.

Withdrawal and Spending

The defendant admitted to the above two cases and confessed to another case of 100 yuan and another of 50 yuan. However, according to postal authorities, the defendant's crimes were not limited to these. Therefore, they requested that the hearing be adjourned for further questioning. The judge questioned the defendant and ordered him to be detained pending further investigation and questioning in seven days.

### Transportation Company Manager Commits Suicide by Poison

Chen Guang, manager of the Hongda Transportation Company at No. 404 Tianjin Road, in the Public Concession, was nearing fifty years of age. Recently, due to a large deficit in the company's accounts and the imminent approach of the end of the year, he was unable to raise funds and felt ashamed to face the shareholders. He conceived the idea of ending his life. Suddenly, at around 3:30 AM yesterday, he secretly swallowed opium paste to commit suicide. When his colleagues discovered him, they quickly called for an ambulance and rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment.

### Wealthy Family's Maid Steals Jewelry

At the wealthy Xu family's home at No. 28, Lane 579, Yuyuan Road, West Shanghai, there were two maids employed, one named A Jin and the other Yu Abao, both young. On the 21st of this month, the two maids suddenly left without reason. Later, after the lady of the house checked, she discovered that gold and jade bracelets kept in the dressing table drawer, as well as gold pearl, diamond, and jade rings, were all missing. Believing they had stolen and fled, she immediately reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, requesting an investigation. The day before yesterday evening, Yu Abao, carrying her share of the stolen goods, intended to sell them at the Litianbao Silver Shop on Nanjing Road. The detectives investigated and arrested her immediately. Yesterday, she was escorted to the First Special District Court, where Judge Meng interrogated her.

### Gambling Den's Outlandish Idea: Advertising for Gambling with Cloth Banners; Perpetrator Apprehended and Sentenced to Two Months

The smoke and gambling areas created by special forces in West Shanghai have recently been strictly blockaded along their borders adjacent to the concession by the Public Concession Police Bureau. The smoke and gambling businesses have suffered a great blow as a result, with business greatly reduced. However, the smoke and gambling taxes paid to those who provide protection cannot be reduced. Therefore, some opium den owners have implemented the trick of delivering to the door to save addicts the trouble and to promote business. As for the gambling dens, in addition to increasing the number of card sharps, they even dared to post gambling advertisements in the streets. Initially, they were only posted near the gambling dens, but now they are gradually progressing to the concession area. The Shen Ji gambling den in Xinkang Lane, Jishifeier Road, is now adding a "copper treasure" department because the existing various gambling games are not enough to fully deceive. The day before yesterday, they wrote an advertisement on red paper and ordered their worker, Ni Zaichao, from Yangzhou, to paste it within the concession. When Ni pasted it on Kang Nuo Road, he was spotted by Chinese Constable No. 3130, who, together with the red paper strip, was arrested and taken to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Yesterday, the police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, prosecuted Ni for the crime of soliciting gambling. After Judge Meng interrogated him and found the facts to be true, he sentenced Ni Zaichao to two months of imprisonment. If a fine is substituted, it is at the rate of three yuan per day. The advertising paper was confiscated.

### A Stranger in a Strange Land, Unable to Make a Living; Voluntarily Enters Prison to Live; Repeatedly Robs and Ultimately Sentenced to Three Months

Chen Changgen, a native of Haimen, Jiangsu, is 28 years old this year. He previously served in the military and the 85th Division Staff in Jiangxi and Henan provinces. Recently, he was dismissed and came to Shanghai. Being a stranger in a strange land and unable to make a living, he had a whimsical idea of entering prison to live. A few days ago, he snatched hats from pedestrians in the streets of the French Concession, standing there without avoiding arrest. He was escorted to the Second Special Court. On the 24th, Judge Miao Qingbang tried him, considering that he had not previously been subject to criminal punishment, and sentenced him to two months of imprisonment, suspended for two years, and released him in court. Yuan Jiayan, the lawyer representing the French Concession Administrative Authority, felt sorry for his plight and gave him one yuan in legal tender, ordering him to go out and start a small business to make a living. However, after his release, only one night passed, and the one yuan had already been spent. Still unable to live, on the afternoon of the 25th, he again snatched a Western woman's leather bag on Julai Road and was arrested. Yesterday, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second District Court by the police station. Yuan Jiahuang, the lawyer representing the French Concession Administrative Authority, stated the case and prosecuted him according to law. When questioned, Chen confessed that he really had no way to make a living, had no relatives or friends to support him in Shanghai, and had no funds to return home. He was forced to break the law and requested legal action. After verification by Presiding Judge Liao, Chen Changgen was sentenced to three months of imprisonment for repeatedly robbing others of movable property.

### Prison Thieves Threaten and Extort Accomplices; Stemming from Unequal Distribution of Loot

Yu Afu, a native of Ningbo, 28 years old, was arrested for theft and sentenced to one year of imprisonment by the Second Special Court. During the appeal period, he was held in the detention center. Now, Yu has submitted a statement to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Shen Ping (22 years old, from Shanghai, sentenced to six months for theft), an inmate in cell 960 of the detention center, and Xiaobaolin, an inmate in cell 15 of the Second Special Prison, namely Ye Amao (22 years old, from [omitted place], sentenced to fourteen years for robbery), of threatening and

Extorting Legal Tender

200 yuan, requesting a legal investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Miao Qingbang presided over the hearing of both parties in the Second Criminal Court. According to the plaintiff Yu Afu, on December 27th, Shen Ping came to my cell door and said that Xiaobaolin had asked him to bring a message to me, saying that he wanted to extort 200 yuan from me. On January 1st, Shen came again to urge me, and I said I would not give the money. Xiaobaolin wanted to "bite" me. I don't know either of them and request an investigation. Shen confessed that Yu Afu asked me to bring a message to Xiaobaolin, telling him

Not to Bite Him

And that he would have a proper way to reward Xiaobaolin. I didn't say anything about 200 yuan. Xiaobaolin confessed that Yu Afu's real name is Fan Jinrong, nicknamed Little Devil Afu. Before, I robbed on Aiduya Road at his instigation. Later, we split 20 yuan. All of our accomplices were arrested, but he alone escaped the net. So, I felt very uncomfortable and asked someone to inquire about his whereabouts. Now that he's in prison, I don't know. He asked Shen to bring a message to me, telling me not to bite him. I didn't extort 200 yuan from him. I've already written a letter to the police station to report it. Yu Afu further claimed that they

Denied It in Court

I reported it to the second section of the prison at the time. The section chief questioned them, and they all admitted it. Please investigate the testimony from the first section, and you will understand, etc. After verifying the confessions in court, the judge ordered that the records be obtained from the prison for review, and the hearing was adjourned to February 4th. Both parties were returned to custody. As for Yu's theft case, the appeal to the High Third Branch Court is scheduled to be heard at 3:00 PM today.

### Silk Merchants from Zhenze Reach a Settlement in Lawsuit

Shi Wenqing and Others Accused of False Accusation

Defendants Summoned Yesterday Failed to Appear

Nine silk merchants from Zhenze, including Zhencheng, Yutong, Zhengyan, Xiej, Ji, Yuxing, Zhentai, Yilixiang, and Guangchangcheng, have recently been mutually suing Shi Wenqing and others in the Civil and Criminal Courts of the First Special District Court. They have now peacefully resolved the matter outside of court, and both parties have withdrawn their lawsuits. However, in the case of Shi et al. suing Tu Junru et al. for defamation, Zhang Heqing was listed as a defendant. Because Zhang did not defame Shi Wenqing et al., he recently hired lawyer Qiu Hanping to submit a statement to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, accusing Shi Wenqing, Sun Xuchu, et al. of joint false accusation. The main points of his statement are roughly as follows: On January 7th, the plaintiff received summons No. 1 of the 28th year, Yi Zi, from the Criminal Court of Your Honorable Court, stating that the defendant Shi Wenqing et al. sued the plaintiff for spreading writings and defaming their reputation. I was greatly surprised. After investigation, the plaintiff did not spread writings in the name of the plaintiff or representing others or firms to defame the defendant's reputation. How could the defendants fabricate facts and falsely sue Your Honorable Court, intending to subject the plaintiff to criminal punishment? Fabricating facts clearly constitutes the crime of false accusation under Article 169, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. I request that you summon all defendants to court to be dealt with according to law. The court accepted the statement, and yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng opened the Third Criminal Court for questioning. The plaintiff Zhang Heqing arrived in court with his agent, lawyer Qiu Hanping, and stated the intent of the prosecution. Because the defendants Shi Wenqing, Sun Xuchu, et al. did not arrive, Judge Huang postponed the hearing and ordered the plaintiff to bring a warrant to summon the defendants to court for further questioning.

Yesterday afternoon, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Second District Court. Yuan Jiahuang, the lawyer representing the French Concession Administrative Authority, stated that the defendants requested a postponement of the robbery case for further investigation and questioning. Detective Chen Fusheng reported that yesterday, the defendants knocked on the back door of the victim's house. The maid Wang Sunshi answered and asked them what they wanted. The defendants falsely claimed to be sent by the Rixin Sheng store and had something to meet with the boss about. The maid opened the door and let the defendants in.

Going Upstairs,

She called the housewife, Chen Li (i.e., Chen Zhiguang's wife), to come downstairs. At that time, the first defendant, Kong Ruian, pulled out a pistol and threatened Li, demanding the keys. The third and fourth defendants, Zhu Zirong and Xu Liangwen, tore off a strip of bed sheet and tied up the hands of the victim's relative, Fang [omitted name].

### News from the Gesthe Labor Transport Company

Carrying Luggage for Customers, Passengers Alike Praise Its Convenience

Mr. Gesthe, a Portuguese merchant, and Mr. Liu Dakui, a prominent figure in the business community, considering that there was a lack of organization for the loading and unloading of passengers' goods and luggage at various ship docks, and that dockworkers often fought over carrying and overcharged passengers, felt that this bad habit, though long-standing, had become even more prevalent since the outbreak of the war, with the influx of refugees from the interior to Shanghai. Messrs. Gesthe and Liu believed that it was necessary to find a way to correct this in order to provide convenience to merchants and travelers and reduce unexpected losses. Therefore, Mr. Gesthe founded the Gesthe Labor Transport Company, with its office located in the Central Building on Nanjing Road, and Mr. Liu serving as the General Manager, with Mr. Cui Conglai as the Director of the Labor Transport Department.

### Letter to the Editor

To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao:

We are writing on behalf of the representative of the Southern Hotel. We have noted that in the news section of the Shen Bao on the 26th of this month, there was a report stating that Wang Zhancheng, a shareholder of the Southern Hotel, was illegally detained and extorted by fellow villagers. It is feared that the statement claiming Wang Zhancheng to be a shareholder is incorrect. Our hotel has no shareholder by the name of Wang Zhancheng. In order to prevent the outside world from misunderstanding the truth, we have specially commissioned your esteemed lawyer to send a letter for correction. We hereby submit the facts as stated above, and respectfully request that your newspaper publish a correction. We would be most grateful.

Respectfully,
Lawyer Song Yuntao

### Salted Pork Shop and Petty Traitor

— Buddha

Mr. Jiang Zifan of Changshu, named Yuanqing, was intelligent from childhood and regarded as a prodigy. As a young man, he went abroad and was later selected by a certain Education Commissioner for the Jiangyin Nanjing Academy, where he was a top student. His mastery of classical scholarship and literary composition were admired. He was known for being unconventional, humorous, and witty, so his writings were also filled with jest, anger, and satire, all becoming art. Zifan was short and stout, with a voice as sharp as a woman's, but his speech was quick and clear. Every word he uttered made listeners burst into laughter, and many called him "Chatty Girl." His life's greatest love was women, so when he came to Shanghai, he spent every night in brothels and salted pork shops. When judging the charm of women, he always started with the skirt, and only a three-inch golden lotus foot would pass the mark; otherwise, beauty would be hard to display. He once served as a teacher (or dean) at the Chengzhong School in Shanghai, but his real intention was not in teaching but in enjoying the scenery. Zifan is now over sixty years old. At his fiftieth double birthday celebration, he wrote a couplet that was quite humorous, but unfortunately, I cannot recall the exact words. After August 13th, he became the head of the Changshu Self-Government Association. A friend, Mr. Jin, wrote a couplet to send him, which captured his self-composed style well. It is recorded below to amuse readers:

Opening his mouth, [obscenity], closing his mouth, [obscenity], sneaking into the salted pork shop, proclaiming himself a great Shanghai playboy.

Last year, resisting Japan, this year, flattering Japan, squeezing into the Self-Government Association, he can be considered a petty traitor of Yu Mountain.

Note: The three-square grid characters are words that Mr. Wu Zhihui often said. It is assumed that readers can guess them and do not need to spell them out. The brilliance of this couplet lies in the words "sneaking" and "squeezing," because this gentleman lost his footing the year before last and had difficulty walking. Moreover, his entry into the Self-Government Association was neither by public election nor by appointment, so if not squeezing, what else could it be?

### Mail Inspection and Postal Workers Protecting the Mail

— Sheng

A friend, Mr. So-and-so, who works in the post office, was chatting with me, so I asked him about the recent developments regarding the Japanese inspection of mail and attempts to take over the post office. He told me many facts in great detail. Many people outside the post office are concerned about the situation, so I have written down his account below.

After the fall of Shanghai, the Japanese invoked the precedent of our government and demanded to inspect mail. Although the director, a Frenchman named Chaplain, tried to negotiate several times, it was ultimately ineffective. In early March of last year, under severe pressure from the Japanese, the various mail departments of the Shanghai General Post Office were moved from the temporary location on Yuyuan Road back to the original site on North Sichuan Road. Within a week, the Japanese sent inspectors to the post office. A total of twenty-one inspectors were sent, assigned to the departments of sealing, delivery, printing, registered mail, express mail, and foreign mail to carry out their work. The distribution of the twenty-one people was not very fixed, and they often rotated among the departments. Their working hours were from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, with two hours in between to go back to Hongkou for meals. They did not permanently reside in the post office.

For outgoing mail, almost all letters sent to government offices, parks, institutions, and newspapers in the mainland were intercepted. Private letters were rarely detained because it was impossible to check them one by one. Newspapers and periodicals were intercepted the most, especially various daily newspapers sent to the guerrilla areas, which rarely made it out. Even bags that had been sealed and were ready to be shipped were torn open and completely seized. Letters sent to foreign countries were not opened due to protests from British and American consuls, but printed materials could not escape their attention. The Millard's Review and the China Press were the most closely watched, and none were able to slip through. Later, they had to find other ways to deliver the mail, no longer through the post office.

Incoming mail was particularly scrutinized, especially those from foreign countries. Whenever foreign mail arrived, three or four inspectors would supervise, opening the bags and inspecting the contents carefully. All righteous books and newspapers were hard to escape. There was also an inspector specifically responsible for inspecting the mail of the Japanese themselves. When Japanese mail arrived, he would be extremely busy, carrying a list with the names of Japanese leftist elements for reference during inspection. Letters sent from Shanghai to Japan were also carefully reviewed by him, showing the strictness of the internal Japanese organization.

In addition to inspecting mail, they also undertook the task of detecting and monitoring the thoughts and actions of the employees in the bureau. They lured those with weak wills, investigated internal operating procedures, and did everything to pave the way for seizing the entire administration of the post office. Because of this special work, their attitude was particularly amiable, sometimes asking you to teach them how to pronounce a few Chinese characters, or persuading you to read Japanese, or even distorting the discussion of ideological issues with you. However, all the employees of the post office knew that behind this "polite" appearance hid unparalleled sinister intentions. They only dealt with them perfunctorily, silently, and coldly, and silence and coldness truly expressed their silent anger. And perfunctoriness revealed their helpless plight. Although a very small number of scoundrels took the opportunity to curry favor with the Japanese and learn Japanese, they could not escape the contempt and sanctions of their colleagues in the end.

After hearing the above, I felt very sad. Although the post office still maintained administrative integrity, like the customs, it was mostly controlled by the Japanese. Later, Mr. So-and-so spoke of the postal workers' firm protection of the mail, and I couldn't help but deeply admire them. On November 4th of last year, the five-colored puppet flag began to fly over the Jianghai Customs, supposedly to commemorate the establishment of the puppet "government." At that time, the post office also suffered the same pressure. It completely relied on the proper handling of the matter by the senior post office officials and the firm attitude of all the postal workers to maintain its integrity. November 10th was the date scheduled for the puppet "government" to take over the post office. The postal workers' union stated: "If you come to take over, at most we will give you an empty house." The Japanese and puppet authorities, in view of the glorious fighting history of the postal employees in the past and the complex international relations, finally gave up their hearts. After that, of course, conspiracies against the post office were endless. Therefore, all employees are even more united under the leadership of the union, vowing to defend the integrity of postal rights to the death.

### "Wings of the Navy"

— Bai Hua

"Men With Wings"

A Paramount Production Showing at the Nanjing Grand Theatre

In the past two months, we have seen three aviation films: "Test Pilot," "Flight Command," and this "Wings of the Navy." Coincidentally, these three works have something in common: a love triangle consisting of two close friends and a female character.

Forgive me for not having read a history of the development of airplanes in the past thirty years, but "Wings of the Navy" is said to chronicle the progress of airplanes over these thirty years, from the Wright brothers' invention of the airplane, through the fierce air battles of the European War, to the worldwide mail flights of today. How the "Wings of the Navy," directed by William Wellman, which is presented to us in a short one hundred minutes, differs in terms of chronology or narration from the history of airplane development, I do not have the ability to write ten thousand or eight thousand words to examine. I am very sorry and regretful about this.

Because "Wings of the Navy" starts with the Wright Brothers' first flight test in 1903 and continues to the successful testing of new bombers in 1938, with the love triangle of Pat, Scott, and Peggy running through these thirty years, the progress of the whole play inevitably feels dry.

The beginning of the film, depicting the childhood of Peggy, Pat, and Scott, is very lively. Their innocence when flying model airplanes; Lanson's successful airplane test, which unfortunately ended in a crash on the first flight; Peggy sitting blankly after the plane burned, Pat and Scott's long silence, and a secret kiss farewell, all portray the psychology of children very thoroughly.

After 1914, the story develops vertically, and the relationship between the three is only deeply impressed upon the audience in those three scenes. That is, after the end of the war, Pat and Peggy have a daughter, and Pat suddenly goes to Morocco to participate in the war. When Scott goes to visit her, Peggy asks, holding her child, "Where did he go?" "Morocco," Scott replies, Peggy slowly comes down the stairs and cries; when Pat returns, and when Scott finally reports Pat's death, the director uses the same lens. These three scenes are very brilliant, both in terms of composition and atmosphere.

This is a color film, and when the airplanes take off, the director seems to pay special attention to the harmony of the fading colors. The flight performances and air battles are all very beautiful.

### "Beware of Fire"

— Dong Guo

"Tock tock...tock tock"

It is the sound of knocking bamboo, carried over in the silent night sky by the wind blowing against my house. The sound is so faint, gradually becoming heavy!

"Tock tock...Beware of fire...tock tock...Close the front door..." Every year, when I hear this sound, I think: - This world is cruel, more cruel than the wind in December: there is selfishness and self-interest between people. In this way, I felt the greatness of the "Beware of Fire" caller, he - although he said he was doing it for some meager rewards, he had a passion that others did not, under the cold night sky, without anyone urging him, he circled around the various neighborhoods, knocking and shouting, again and again, until the sky revealed dawn. He makes us pay attention to whether there are any small fires that could start a prairie fire, and he also drives away the thieves digging holes in the back door.

"Tock tock...Prop up the back door...tock tock...Cold winter month..." The sound is faint again, it should be going far away!

Yes, I admire and sympathize with the "Beware of Fire" caller very much, and I would feel so sad for him that I almost shed tears. It was the first time I saw his aging appearance, during the day, when he was going door to door asking for some meager rewards. I saw that his hair was already very white, his eyelids were drooping, unable to distinguish the black and white of his pupils, and his back had long been bent flat to his waist: carrying a bamboo tube, carrying a lantern with the word "fire" written upside down, shivering, tears constantly flowing to his beard.

"Tock tock...Sir"!

People impatiently gave him two copper coins, and he walked away gratefully.

"He has been calling 'Beware of Fire' for twenty or thirty years. The earliest time I saw him, he was still young! Now, looking at him, I'm afraid he won't live much longer"! Someone said to me.

Twenty or thirty years, what a long sentence! From youth to old age, his life must have been full of pain and misfortune. Yes, I also believe that he will die soon, and he must die very miserably, perhaps with no one to collect his bones. Humanity is always so cruel!

However, I remember very clearly that he was still alive in a winter before August 13th, and he was still calling "Beware of Fire". But where is he now? Blasted into mud by artillery fire? Trampled to pieces under the feet of fleeing crowds? Or starving to death in a dilapidated house?...A tragic image of an old man's corpse appeared in my mind, and I couldn't think further.

"Tock tock...tock tock..." The sound is closer again.

Is he that old man? No! He is another old man, I remember, he is also a poor old man. "Tock...Beware of fire...cough cough"

Hearing the suffocating cough, I knew that he was struggling with the fierce north wind, and I seemed to see him embarking on the path of death like the previous old man.

Episode 2: Engineer Lin Cleverly Explains Standardization, Director Jin Eloquently Discusses Equality

Lin Jiancheng said, "Speaking of the petty cash issue, it's a kind of bad habit. Why is there petty cash in addition to the main accounts?" According to the older generation, China once vigorously promoted the New Life Movement, wanting to abolish that kind of petty cash, but they couldn't abolish it no matter what. In addition to petty cash, there's also extra petty cash, and even petty cash exceeding the main accounts. This isn't just in China; it's the same in foreign countries. Among them, England is relatively better; France is the most severe. Every move requires petty cash. Especially in entertainment and dining places, if you don't give them petty cash, their faces will change. Therefore, people call it the 'Country of Petty Cash.' In fact, honestly speaking, petty cash is 'public bribery.' It's really not easy for us to abolish the petty cash system now." Jin Danyu said, "This comes from the class system; it's unavoidable. What's called petty cash was previously called tips, meaning you served me attentively, and the master would reward you with some money. Later, it became indispensable, a mandatory petty cash, and the poor became poorer, and the rich became richer. The poor then begged for the leftovers from the rich, and the rich bought the favor of the poor. This is how petty cash formed. So, China once wanted to abolish petty cash, but I said it was dealing with the symptoms without addressing the root cause." For example, in a society with a steep class system, it's not easy to achieve equality. I also heard an old gentleman say that in the Qing Dynasty, servants addressed their masters as 'Master' or 'Lord.' After the revolution, they were no longer allowed to use these titles and were changed to 'Mr.' However, what happened after they were called 'Mr.'? The master-servant relationship remained the same! Especially in our female circles, concubines and prostitutes are still prevalent! What equality are we talking about? Changing the titles, is that considered equality? So, you say it's not easy to abolish the petty cash system; I say it's extremely easy. As long as everyone knows equality, everyone knows that taking petty cash is shameful, everyone knows that besides what I should take, I don't need to ask for petty cash, then petty cash will naturally abolish itself. The various affairs in the world are shared by various people, and there shouldn't be a distinction between noble and lowly occupations. Now, our new China is striving to move in that direction. Just like my little sister Wang Jing, she works as a waitress here. Does she lose her personality? Does she make us lose our respect? She laughed and said, 'Sister Danyu! You're talking about me again. I can hear you, what little sister Wang Jing...' Lin Jiancheng said, 'She's not talking about you; she's giving a grand speech here. It's a pity you came late; otherwise, you could have heard a speech.'" (23)

### Anti-Japanese War Newsreel: The Mother of Guerrillas, Old Mrs. Zhao, on the Silver Screen

Scolding her son to strive for the country, with tears and sobs. Her son, Zhao Tong, also gives a speech.

Old Mrs. Zhao, "The Mother of Guerrillas," is the mother of Mr. Zhao Tong, the leader of the North China Guerrillas. People call her the mother of our Chinese nation. In North China, she led hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers, launching guerrilla warfare, entering the enemy's rear, and launching surprise attacks to avoid the enemy's strengths and attack their weaknesses. She had already established many meritorious deeds, causing the enemies to be terrified.

Although she is an old woman approaching seventy years old, her brave and strong fighting spirit does not yield to that of young people. Not long ago, she and Mr. Zhao Tong both went from North China to Hong Kong, both with important missions. Recently, Mrs. Zhao finished her business in Hong Kong and went to Singapore to carry out propaganda work. Mr. Zhao Tong will also return to the front lines in the next few days to command the brave soldiers in North China to fight. On the 24th of last month, before she departed by boat, Mr. Li Gongke, the Hong Kong representative of the Central Photography Studio, not only filmed the real scene of Old Mrs. Zhao leaving Hong Kong for Singapore at the wharf, but also invited her and her son to the Nanyue Photography Studio in advance to shoot several sound clips of her scolding her son. First, a medium shot of Old Mrs. Zhao and Mr. Zhao Tong standing together was filmed. Old Mrs. Zhao said to him: "I am now going to Singapore to do propaganda for the overseas Chinese. When you return to the front, you must strive for the victory of our resistance against Japan. We must adhere to the spirit of resisting Japan to the end, and not be discouraged halfway. You go ahead and work hard, and don't worry about your parents. If you have a sincere heart to be filial to your parents, then be filial to the country. Being filial to the country is being filial to your parents. Now I am going! You must work hard. If you do not be filial to the country and cannot fulfill your responsibilities, then you are not my son, and I am not considered your mother." When she said the last few sentences, her voice and expression were particularly poignant, and she couldn't help but burst into tears. The people who were visiting were also greatly moved, and everyone couldn't help but shed tears.

After shooting a close-up of Mrs. Zhao, they continued to shoot Mr. Zhao Tong's reply to his mother: "Mother, please rest assured, your son will never forget your teachings. Your son will use his past spirit to kill the enemy, kill all the enemies on our land, and fight back to our hometown. Absolutely resist Japan to the end, support our highest leader, and strive for the independence, freedom, and happiness of our Republic of China."

Finally, Mr. Zhao Tong's speech on the guerrillas was filmed, mainly saying: "The guerrillas prevent the enemy from being able to rest in the occupied areas, dispersing their forces, making the enemy exhausted, and giving considerable assistance to the regular army. At the same time, I hope that the guerrillas in South China and the guerrillas in North China can communicate with each other, exert greater efficiency, and kill all the enemies as soon as possible."

The film is over five hundred feet long and is prepared to be shown in theaters in the mainland as a newsreel. Fellow countrymen who admire Mrs. Zhao and Mr. Zhao can admire their demeanor and listen to their patriotic speeches on the silver screen. In this way, the effectiveness it will have in terms of anti-Japanese propaganda is obviously unusual; it is just that we, the masses trapped on this isolated island, are eager to see it, but we have no chance to see this film for the time being.

### A Record of the Shanghai Bank Employees' Peking Opera Society

— Quechang

Last Friday, through the introduction of a friend, I made a visit to the "Shanghai Bank Employees' Peking Opera Society" at Building 190 Renji Road, No. 75 in the inner building. I am writing it down specifically: The society was established in 1929. The bank authorities, because this is a legitimate form of entertainment for employees in their spare time, are willing to strongly promote it and provide monthly subsidies. Since the society does not feel economically difficult, it is naturally easier to handle affairs, and the achievements are remarkable. After January 28th, the market became increasingly depressed, and the society was implicitly disbanded. In February of the year before last, they felt that the social economy had been revived and all industries were flourishing, and it was still necessary for colleagues to adjust their fatigue in their spare time, so they asked the authorities to revive the banner. After the revival, they only sang for two private performances and one dress rehearsal, and the bad news of the July 7th Incident spread to Shanghai. The society also temporarily stopped because of this. Now that Shanghai is flourishing in a special environment, the colleagues of the society, in their distress, have again negotiated the consent of the authorities, and on December 1st of last year, they reorganized the society. There are now fifty or sixty members. Their ambition is to succeed in creating a completely amateur acting troupe. All the main characters, supporting roles, extras, and scenes are all performed by the members themselves, without relying on professionals. The society already has three teachers, and they also want to find two more teachers to teach martial arts and clown roles. From 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day is their time for rehearsing, vocalizing, and learning opera. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday is the day for implementing sound rehearsals. Their sound rehearsals are arranged by the opera affairs department according to the level of learning of each member, so that everyone has the opportunity to have a sound rehearsal. This method is very helpful for beginners. Now, except for the drummer and the musician, who are still professionals, the other percussion instruments are already played entirely by the members. There are many people learning stage management, and there are also one or two learning the erhu. Even the small supporting roles (sweeping-edge old men, etc.) and the extra learners are not unwilling to learn because they are small roles. Recently, they have also slightly renovated the original house, adding a stage and installing several follow spotlights. This kind of equipment is still seen for the first time in various amateur acting troupes in Shanghai! I am writing this article not to promote them. My motive is as follows: (1) The society has received the promotion of the bank authorities, which shows the authorities' emphasis on the employees' spare time entertainment, and they give some comfort to the colleagues, which is worthy of praise; (2) The organization of the society is very sound, the facilities are very complete, which is absolutely different from the situation of other acting troupes; (3) The society's ambition is very great. Originally, extra runners, small supporting roles, and stage management are all part of the art, and should not be neglected just because they cannot be in the spotlight. The society is willing to put effort into these small places, and if they can succeed in the future, it can be regarded as the society's honor and a good story in the amateur acting world.

### The Rebirth of Shanghai's Film Industry

### Singing Girl Training School

— Wen

In the film city, almost every film production company has a singing girl training school attached to it. Among them, the 20th Century Fox company has the largest scale, with an annual budget of 850,000 US dollars. Currently, the school has 500 students. In addition to providing them with room and board, the school also provides them with weekly remuneration ranging from 35 to 150 US dollars. Those who participate in performances in films also receive additional remuneration, just like temporary actors. Many of these singing girls are graduates of universities or specialized schools. They hope to become a big star (those with excellent grades after graduation are listed as actors of the company), so they are willing to undergo a year and six months of training at the school. This kind of singing girl school is called "Beautiful Legs School" by Americans. Because one of the standard qualifications for the school to select students is: "Are your thighs beautiful"!

### The Female Prisoner Escorted in the Golden Theater's Charity Performance

— The

Mr. Huang Zijingbo is a native of Xinghua, Jiangsu Province. He has been doing business in Shanghai for many years. He is elegant and handsome, and enjoys making friends. He is especially enthusiastic about social charity events. In his spare time, he dabbles in opera, and is skilled in both Qingyi and Huashan roles! He has performed "Princess Visiting Her Mother" and "Yan Jiao of Wulongyuan" in the Golden Theater's charity performances and Ping She's private performances. His performance has been fairly well received. Recently (on the evening of the 24th), he once again spoke out for the refugees, and guest-starred as the female prisoner in "The Female Prisoner Escorted" at the Golden Theater. His voice was even more robust than before. The long sections of "fan diao" (reversed melody) and "xing lu liu shui" (flowing melody of the road) were sung in the style of Mr. Mou Yanqiu, and were very stable. In terms of body movements, after being instructed by the famous actress Jin Biyan, there was also visible progress. Furthermore, Sun Lanting played the escort, which added a lot of color to the play. Mr. Huang has only been dabbling in opera for less than two years, and he has already achieved such results, which is gratifying. The published picture is his recent photo.

Statement: The article "Hollywood's Chinese Style" written by Mr. Zhen, published in this magazine on the 24th, has been found to be a duplicate submission and has already been published elsewhere. The payment will be cancelled. Thank you to Mr. Qian Liren for reporting it!

### Chess World

Opening Strategy - Eighth Game

Black Moves First

Screen Horse Against Central Cannon (Patrolling River Chariot Method)

Move follows the seventh game

Chariot 3 Advances 2, Changing to Chariot 3 Retreats 1, Horse 3 Advances 4, Horse 8 Advances 9, Horse 7 Advances 6

Cannon 5 Advances 4, Cannon 3 Moves Sideways to 5, Cannon 7 Moves Sideways to 5

(Explanation) Chariot 2 Advances 4, is a standard move, different from Advancing 6. Pawn 7 Advances 1, is the intention of Chariot 2 Advancing 4, targeting the pawn, the purpose is to dissolve the opponent's defensive work. Chariot 2 Moves Sideways to 7, patrolling the river chariot's role, is to control the opponent's pawn and horse's path of advancement. Cannon 2 Retreats 1, preparing to open up the black side's seventh file chariot, so as not to occupy the strategic pass, which can both cover the horse's steps, and can supplement the elephant's position. Cannon 8 Moves Sideways to 7, should capture the chariot, Chariot 7 Moves Sideways to 3 to concede, compete for the cannon to move first, Pawn 7 Advances 1, a dangerous move, Chariot 3 Advances 1 forces the elephant to leave, then it will lose the initiative. Elephant 3 Advances 5, is the intention of Pawn 7 Advancing 1. Chariot 3 Advances 2 to remove the horse, advancing at the risk. Horse 3 Retreats 5 to capture the chariot. At this time, although the black side loses a chariot, there is still much to be done, and the victory or defeat is undecided. The mysteries will be published in detail in the variations of various opening strategies.

Chariot 3 Advances 1 changes to Retreat 1, is stable. Horse 3 Advances 4, a preemptive move. Horse 7 Advances 6, intends to capture the center pawn. Cannon 5 Advances 4, if the red side responds with the minister, the center pawn can be unharmed. Cannon 3 Moves Sideways to 5, facing the cannon, not being threatened by the middle road. Cannon 7 Moves Sideways to 5, avoiding the red side advancing the horse to capture both pieces, taking the momentum of connecting cannons. According to this game, although the black side has the advantage of double cannons, the red side also has two horses competing for the initiative, which can be said to have an equal situation.

### Secret History of the Forbidden City and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (87)

— Xu Muyun

Da Li Wu Was a Notorious Foul-Mouthed Person

Last time, we talked about how bad the character of Red-Eyed Wang Si was. Little did we know that there was also a famous martial Laosheng Li Shunting who not only had a strange temper but also had a very foul mouth. Regarding his abilities, he was a top-notch performer in every aspect, including civil and martial arts, Kunqu and other operas. He could use a melancholic tune in the Gaoqiang shawm music. It could be said that his voice was unique throughout the ages. Back then, Mr. He Jiu, the number one copper hammer painted face actor, had a voice that was high enough, but he felt somewhat strained when singing the play "Fengyunhui" with him. In total, he knew no less than three or four hundred lines of plays. "Exploring the Camp" and "Iron Dragon Mountain" were considered unparalleled. Insiders called him Da Li Wu instead of his name because he ranked fifth among his siblings. Because Li Wu had no virtue in his mouth, he did not have good relationships with others, so he never became very popular. Throughout his life, he always served as a supporting actor. However, if the leading actors wanted him to co-star with them, they had to be careful of his bad ideas at all times. If they didn't handle it well, he might knock you down on stage. (Knock down means being defeated). At that time, there were several famous red actors who were knocked down by him. These people were Shuang Kuoting (i.e., Lao Shuang Chu), Mei Rongzhai, and Long Changsheng.

Shuang Kuoting was a famous Laosheng of the Kui school. Once, when singing "Zhushazhi", he let Da Li Wu play the role of the sick ghost Wu Da Xiang Gong. When he was having a dialogue with Han Yuanwai, he deliberately played a trick. When the Laosheng was about to sing the "I save you in urgency, I save you in difficulty, I save you from poverty" line, he missed a beat, receiving boos from the entire audience. The next day, Li Wu came to the backstage, with a pipe in his mouth and a tobacco pouch in his hand. The pouch was tied with a pendant carved with a Confucius shoe. A cross-shaped board was hanging on the upper of the shoe. When Boss Shuang entered the backstage, he deliberately pretended not to see him. He pointed at the tobacco pouch pendant and said to the people in the backstage: "Do you think my pendant is fresh? A board hanging on the shoe." This name is called "missing a beat." As soon as Shuang Chu heard it, he knew that he was mocking him for missing a beat yesterday; but knowing that this person had a bad mouth, he had to swallow his anger and not argue with him.
