Xingji: In the areas of Wenxi, Xia County, Anyi, and Yuncheng in Southern Shanxi, more than ten thousand Japanese troops, supported by the Japanese army and air force, launched their tenth large-scale offensive towards Zhongtiao Mountain. The Chinese army divided its forces to meet the enemy, engaging in fierce battles for several days. The Japanese suffered extremely heavy casualties, and all routes reported setbacks.

He is a top graduate of the 20th class of the military academy and has served as regiment commander, regimental adjutant, battalion commander, and staff instructor. His unit was among the elite of the Japanese troops attacking this time.

At a time when the enemy was rampaging, he strictly guarded against the barbarians. Despite all kinds of hardships, he maintained his integrity throughout, dedicating himself solely to the righteousness. I had hoped that he would uphold justice and reform the public. How could I have expected that a minor illness would suddenly take him away from this world? I am saddened by the collapse of the universe and deeply saddened by our thirty years of friendship. I am heartbroken by the loss of my virtuous hero. I believe that your father's ambition was to be a sage, and his actions were exemplary. Although his body has passed away, his spirit is still strong in China. His achievements are comparable to those of his predecessors, and he has lived up to what he learned. The National Government has clearly ordered commendations for his life and death. I hope that he can comfort his spirit in heaven and serve as a model for mankind.

Editorial

### What Will the League of Nations Do?

The League of Nations General Assembly is holding a meeting of member states in Geneva, Switzerland today, with the Finnish government's complaint about the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland as the main agenda item. According to predictions from London yesterday, the League of Nations General Assembly is likely to decide on the following four points regarding this case: 1. Condemn the Soviet Union's aggression; 2. Request that all countries not provide the Soviet Union with any assistance; 3. Request that all countries provide Finland with as much assistance as possible; 4. Request that the Soviet Union stop its aggression. Although this prediction should not be regarded as certain, the information revealed is tantamount to announcing to the world that there is nothing more to hope for beyond these four points. We have repeatedly stated our views on the Finland-Soviet Union issue, and we do not want to discuss it again. Regarding the League of Nations, please allow us to briefly express our thoughts during this General Assembly period, or when all parties are paying more attention.

The League of Nations was established after the First World War and was highly regarded for a time. The covenant it represented was particularly capable of maintaining international order and laying the foundation for world peace. In 1931, after the test of Japan's invasion of China, its weaknesses were fully exposed. The violent did as they pleased in actions that violated the alliance, and the strong were negligent in their duty to protect the law. As a result, the League of Nations was on its last breath, only preserving its form. Although it has made considerable contributions in health cooperation and technical matters, it is not the original purpose of organizing the League of Nations. This can prove the existence of the League of Nations, but it is not enough to explain the value of the League of Nations. Looking back on the experience of the League of Nations from beginning to end, those who regret, sigh, curse, and ridicule it each have their own reasons. Those who support, play with, despise, and destroy it also each have their own reasons. If a group of member organizations has such a disparity in the attitudes of its members towards the group, then it will eventually collapse, which is not unexpected.

In the past, we had the highest hopes for the League of Nations at first, and then we were deeply disappointed. Today, although we no longer have any extravagant hopes, we still earnestly hope that the world will not give up eating because of choking, regarding it as hopeless and discarding it like worn-out shoes. It is true that human beings live in groups, naturally evolving from spouses to families to tribes to states to countries, and no one can be outside of it. Furthermore, linking from countries is still a natural trend. Unexpected setbacks are inevitable, but the natural law has sufficient reason and great power to eventually complete and will never be abandoned due to unexpected setbacks. If the League of Nations has hidden causes for its unsound foundation, unreasonable defects in its organization, and unrealistic provisions in its alliance, and even the countries that preside over its affairs have serious suspicions of disloyalty, then its twenty years of history have not only failed to make good use of time to gradually make the unsound sound, the unreasonable reasonable, and the unrealistic realistic, in order to fulfill the mission that the League of Nations should have, but also have been in a step-by-step retreat in matters of deception. Who is really to blame for this? It is true to say that Britain and France were perfunctory, it is true to say that Japan and Germany were rebellious, and it is true to say that the United States stayed out of it, but the failure of the highest organization of mankind is better to say that mankind has not exhausted its efforts and done its best for this highest organization than to blame anyone. Those who destroy international order and world peace deliberately accumulate violence and commit violent acts. Those who love peace and admire order, in addition to using their brains and ink to develop the League of Nations Covenant, each paying membership fees, have they cultivated the slightest behavioral power for those who act for the League of Nations? It is bound to fail to use those with no power to restrain violence, and to use those who cannot act to restrain violent acts. How can one wait for failure before knowing this? In the past, China's appeals were repeatedly relied upon as such, and today Finland's appeals and the reported resolutions are like this, which can be said to be just right for the League of Nations, which has no power to act.

Since the League of Nations has no power to act, what is the point of the League of Nations for the world? Why is it still earnestly hoped today that the world will not discard the League of Nations? When China appealed to the League of Nations, China's intention was not to rely on the League of Nations, but to believe that the League of Nations should make a practical representation within the scope of what it could do. The facts showed that the representation was extremely bad. The right and wrong of the Sino-Japanese issue have been clear from the beginning, but the League of Nations still used investigation as a method to delay its judgment. Finally, the condemnation of Japan came after the delayed investigation, but it was not because of the investigation that Japan should be condemned. Whether the condemnation of Japan was helpful to China is a matter of debate, and those who are malicious even mock the Chinese government for delusional reliance. However, Finland does not know that the League of Nations is incapable of action, and does not know that empty words of condemnation of the Soviet Union are of no help to Finland's difficulties. Still, it followed in China's footsteps and did not hesitate to complain. What is the reason for this? The various countries clearly know that the League of Nations cannot do anything, but they still do not hesitate to open meetings. What is the reason for this? Is it not a counter-evidence that all countries, regardless of whether they have encountered aggression or not, do need an international supreme organization? Only with this need should we seek to adapt to this need. The way to adapt is definitely not to abandon the incapable League of Nations, but to enrich the League of Nations, so that the unsound will become sound, the unreasonable will become reasonable, and the unrealistic will become realistic, and finally be able to fulfill its mission. China's appeal has not yet been settled, and Finland's appeal has just begun. Even if the League of Nations cannot immediately take any effective action, it should learn from the tests of appeals and the lessons of facts, and take the opportunity of the meeting to thoroughly reform the League of Nations itself. For the countries of the world, since it cannot force the whole to take the scope of the League of Nations, it should also put forward some principles and unite those who faithfully follow it as one, removing clauses that cannot be implemented and members who do not follow it. For world disputes, since it cannot strictly enforce sanctions, it should also initiate arbitration so that the countries in the dispute have room to reconsider their attitude and have the opportunity to accept arbitration. There are few countries that are confident that they will be able to resolve disputes in war in countries that are in a state of war. If the League of Nations has an attempt to initiate it, even if it fails, it is not enough to criticize the League of Nations, which is on its last breath.

### British Admiralty Announces Large-Scale Mine Clearance; U.S. Counter-Sales to Britain Will Be Appropriate; German Economy Minister Says He Is Fearless

London: The British Admiralty announced yesterday that in order to control navigation in designated areas within British territorial waters, the Admiralty plans to declare maritime law in order to conduct large-scale mine clearance of British coastal waters. Naval commanders in the Thames Estuary, Portsmouth Harbour, Firth of Forth, Orkney, and Shetland Islands have been ordered to manage navigation in accordance with the new regulations. (10th United Press dispatch)

London: According to reliable sources, as of now, as many as 40 German submarines have been sunk by British and French warships. It is generally said that Germany had about 60 submarines before the outbreak of the war. Although the country's shipyards have concentrated their efforts to speed up manufacturing, due to too many losses, there is still a shortage of supply. In addition, the work of adding submarines in the country is not as difficult as replenishing submarine officers and soldiers. (10th Havas dispatch)

New York: Those with good connections in Washington say that if Britain allows Americans to purchase German goods and certain German items, such as optical instruments, that cannot be purchased elsewhere, the United States will be satisfied. If Britain can do this, the United States will ignore the British blockade. (9th Reuters dispatch)

Munich: German Economy Minister Fink delivered a speech here yesterday, explaining the superiority of Germany's wartime economy, saying that the full effect of Germany's four-year plan must be evident recently. The huge factories that have been built are now beginning to produce, and most other factories are under construction or improvement. Even in wartime, all of our artificial products are more, better, and cheaper than usual, while Britain's export trade has been reduced by 40%. This is why Britain wants to blockade Germany's exports. The purpose of Britain's recent blockade policy is nothing more than to destroy the principles of free trade and maintain Britain's dominance. But Germany today has a way to resist. What we cannot obtain from overseas today can be obtained from Soviet Russia in large part. In addition to the feed agreement that has already been announced, the Soviet Union has also promised to supply Germany with a large amount of beryllium sand, kimberlite, cotton, wool, and kerosene. This item cargo, which will increase greatly in the future. During the First World War, Germany was surrounded by enemies on three sides. Today, the situation is different. The entire Europe, except for eastern France, and a part of vast Asia can be used by our country. Although Britain monopolizes the North Sea, Germany's trade with the markets of Central Europe and Southeastern Europe can continue without hindrance. (10th Haitong dispatch)

The Hague: The National Daily, run by German Air Force Minister Goering, published an article today stating that Germany will soon make its people bear greater financial sacrifices. The article quoted Hitler as saying, "What we have today is not worth considering. The only factor that determines the future is Germany's victory." The article continued, "Everyone in Germany must participate in this common destiny according to their ability, not according to their willingness. So far, the war has not required any sacrifices in the family, but everyone in the family must understand that the time when the entire meaning of the head of state's words will come is now approaching." (9th Reuters dispatch)

### Anglo-French Economic Blockade Intensifies Pressure on Germany

(London Air Mail) British Labour Party Deputy Chairman Greenwood recently published an article stating, in brief, that most people view this war as something imaginary, with no real possibility. The reason for this is that the general public believes that once the war breaks out, Britain and France will inevitably suffer large-scale air raids. German aircraft formations will circle over London and other vulnerable cities, dropping bombs. However, the reality is that on the morning of the declaration of war and in the days that followed, although air raid alerts were issued in certain places,

life was able to maintain a reasonable normality. People in uniform were everywhere, and scenes of war were visible, but German bombs did not rain down. News of the war was also unusually quiet, leading many to believe that the war had no "real" nature. In fact, the silence of war news was mostly due to the government's carefulness and the failure to handle intelligence matters perfectly. It should be known that although the progress of the war may not be entirely as expected, it is indeed in progress. This is well known to the British people. However, the people are neither afraid nor as overly excited as they were in the early days of the last European war, engaging in flag-waving, cheering, and frenzied parades. On the contrary, they only accept the provocation and fight to the end with a calm attitude. The entire nation is currently working urgently to address national affairs. Although there have been some missteps due to delayed preparations, the organization and utilization of national resources are progressing daily, which is a real situation. I recall that when the last European war broke out in August 1914, we were not adequately prepared in all aspects, and Belgium and France were invaded shortly afterward. This time, the situation is very different from the past. The Anglo-French Allied forces have already entered Germany, thereby stopping the enemy and preventing them from crossing the red line. No inch of land in Western Europe has been trampled by the enemy. Not only that, but the economic blockade policy implemented by Britain and France is putting increasing pressure on Germany. Hitler's situation is becoming increasingly difficult, unable to obtain the raw materials necessary for the war. The British Navy is gradually eliminating the threat of submarines in various oceans, and the method of warships escorting merchant convoys is becoming increasingly effective. Since the start of the war, the number of merchant ships sunk by German submarines has been decreasing daily. Although the losses suffered by Britain are regrettable, new ships are being launched one after another. The number of merchant ships owned by our country is actually more than it was at the start of the war. The supply of food and raw materials is steadily arriving, and the people have no fear of famine, as was the case during the last European war. (Havas)

### European War Zone: American Ships Halt Voyages; Totaling Eighty-Four Vessels

Washington: The American Steamship Company previously applied to the Maritime Commission on the 7th of last month to transfer nine of the company's eleven transatlantic ships to Panamanian registration so that they could continue to operate between Europe and the Americas without being prohibited by neutrality laws. According to an announcement by the Maritime Commission, the American Steamship Company has withdrawn this application and intends to register with another undeclared country. (Reuters, 9th)

(New York Air Mail) Since the establishment of the new Neutrality Act, President Roosevelt has designated the European war zone, prohibiting American merchant ships from sailing there. As a result, eighty-four American ships have halted voyages, totaling 536,300 tons. Of the 326 American ships operating overseas, totaling 2,150,000 tons, the number of ships now halted accounts for approximately 35 percent, while the tonnage halted accounts for 24 percent. How this situation will affect Far Eastern trade is still unknown. President Roosevelt once said that these halted merchant ships could not be absorbed by Latin America or the Pacific, which has attracted much attention. Various shipping companies on the West Coast are planning to expand cargo operations in the Pacific. Furthermore, because Japan purchases almost all goods from the United States using its own ships, they are discussing various methods to request government assistance to force Japanese buyers to use American ships to transport a portion of the goods. However, because the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty will expire on January 25th of next year, the trade relationship between the two countries is quite unstable, so this issue is also very difficult to resolve.

### The United States Strengthens Naval and Land Defenses; Building Large Warships and Vessels

Washington: To adapt to the recent strengthening of the United States' Caribbean Sea defenses and to safeguard the Panama Canal and the American continent, President Roosevelt officially announced yesterday the Tenth Naval District, including Saint Croix and the Virgin Islands. Until today, Saint Croix was under the jurisdiction of the South Carolina Naval District. At the same time, the army is increasing land and air force strength in Puerto Rico, while the navy is building a major air base there. (United Press, 10th)

Washington: Acting U.S. Secretary of the Navy Edison yesterday signed a contract worth five million U.S. dollars to build eleven high-speed motor torpedo boats and twelve submarine destroyers, modeled after the British small boat squadrons. The new torpedo boats and submarine destroyers will be used for neutrality patrols. (United Press, 10th)

### Portuguese Ship Carrying Germans Captured by British; Totaling Twenty-Five

Lisbon: The Portuguese ship "Arrango" was intercepted yesterday in Portuguese coastal waters by a British destroyer, which sent personnel on board to inspect various documents. It was discovered that the ship was carrying twenty-five German passengers, who were immediately taken into custody on the ship. It was determined that these individuals were sailors employed by various merchant ships in Panama, who had been dismissed due to the outbreak of the European war. They had first boarded the Italian mail ship "Saturnia" and arrived at the Portuguese Azores, and then transferred to the "Arrango" in preparation to come here, but were captured by the British destroyer en route. (Havas, 10th)

Oslo: The Norwegian merchant ship Gimle (1,271 tons) exploded and sank off the east coast of England. The crew drifted at sea in lifeboats for three days before being rescued by another Norwegian ship and arrived at a certain port today. (Reuters, 9th)

### German Newspaper Warns Neutral Countries

Berlin: The "German Foreign Political News" recently published an article commenting on the attempts by the Allied countries of Britain and France to involve neutral countries in the war and use them to achieve their war aims. It stated, in brief, that before the outbreak of the war, the Allied countries devoted themselves to winning over neutral countries, and this has intensified after the war. They not only want them to fight Germany economically, but also want them to engage in real war. If a country willingly allows itself to be used by the Allied countries and listens to their promises, it is tantamount to digging its own grave. The Allied countries often use the maintenance of peace as a pretext for enticing people to conclude security pacts. Now they also realize that adopting this approach is no longer appropriate, so they have changed their approach and are engaging in inciting workers in various countries to carry out strikes. Romania can be taken as an example. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish conflict, the Allied countries have regarded it as the most favorable event and have begun to intensify the flames of war, instigating Finland to adopt a stubborn attitude. Allied politicians clearly want to drag neutral countries into the war. Poland is one example, and its role is nothing more than to make neutral countries their helpers in achieving the goal of winning glory for the Allied countries. Under such circumstances, neutral countries should urgently assess the benefits that this kind of democratic politics gives to mankind. It should be known that the Allied countries will do everything possible to disrupt the peace and order of areas that have not yet been involved in the war. (Haitong, 10th)

### Roosevelt Studies European Situation

Washington: President Roosevelt yesterday continued to study the confidential report on the European situation submitted by U.S. Ambassador to London Kennedy. The ambassador met with the president twice, and when he left Washington for Boston yesterday, he left a small box with the president. The ambassador plans to return to Washington in the middle of next week. At the same time, the State Department received a large number of suggestions supporting and opposing the severance of relations with the Soviet Union to protest the Soviet invasion of Finland. Republican Senator Vandenberg of Michigan sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull requesting the government to reconcile its attitude toward the Soviet Union with the policies of other countries in the Western Hemisphere, that is, to sever relations with the Soviet Union. (United Press, 10th)

### Italian Youth Demonstrate Against Soviet Union; Military Police Intervene

Rome: A thousand Italian students and Fascist youth groups again went to the Soviet Embassy yesterday, shouting slogans such as "Down with the Communist Party" and "Long Live Finland!" However, they were dispersed near the embassy by a thousand soldiers wearing steel helmets and carrying rifles and bayonets. (United Press, 10th)

### Italian Foreign Policy Not Swayed by Other Countries

Rome: The "Electrical News" reported that British newspapers, with headlines such as "Italian Anger" or "Italian Warning to the Soviet Union," are attempting to use Italian sympathy for Finland as the basis for an Italian anti-Soviet policy. We should immediately point out that British people harbor this hope without any basis. Italy's foreign policy is based on its own interests and will not be affected by foreign propaganda. Italy knows very well that certain countries, although praising morality, use pragmatism and power politics as principles when distributing spoils. "Electrical News" claimed that the Allied countries cannot incite Fascist Italy to take hostile action against the Soviet Union or destroy the German-Italian alliance. Italy understands that the purpose of foreign misinterpretations of Italian public opinion is to persuade Italy to join the Allied countries. (Haitong, 10th)

### Soviet Forces Approach Petsamo Port; Fierce Fighting Occurs at Kemijärvi; Finnish Forces Prepare to Counterattack in Three Directions

Stockholm: According to news from Finland, Soviet troops have advanced to within fifteen kilometers of the port of Petsamo. Those advancing on the Lake Ladoga front have broken through Finnish lines near the town of Salmi. (Havas, 10th)

Moscow: The Leningrad Military District issued the following recent war report: "On the Murmansk front, Soviet troops conducted operations on December 9th to destroy a Finnish resistance base 50 kilometers south of Petsamo. At the same time, the mine-clearing work at the Petsamo port berthing area has been completed. On the Ukhta-Repola-Porosozero and Petrozavodsk fronts, Soviet troops advanced 79 kilometers from the border area. After the Soviet army occupied the city of Suomussalmi, it continued to advance toward Kivela. In the Karelian Isthmus, Soviet troops are still advancing after breaking through the main Finnish position in the Taipaleenjoki River basin. Fierce fighting has occurred in the Kexholm area. (TASS, 10th)

Finnish Border: According to reliable news obtained here last night, Finnish forces are now preparing to counterattack Soviet troops in three directions. The counterattack will be launched on one front in the Karelian Isthmus, and on the other two fronts from the Finnish central line. It is reported that fierce fighting has now occurred on the Finnish central line. The Red Army in that area is unable to advance, while Finnish forces are counterattacking in the Koirajärvi and Suomussalmi areas, and have recaptured many villages and towns. It is said that in the vast swampy area at the junction of Koirajärvi and Suomussalmi, a small number of Finnish troops fiercely resisted throughout yesterday, preventing the Red Army from advancing. It is said that the Finnish army is adopting ingenious guerrilla tactics, attacking the Red Army from the forests from time to time. At the same time, according to unconfirmed reports, Finnish forces have cut off the Murmansk and Leningrad railways. In addition, 3,000 to 4,000 Swedish volunteers are now concentrated on the Swedish-Finnish border, preparing to enter Finland and assist Finnish forces in combat. (United Press, 10th)

Helsinki: The Finnish Defense Forces General Headquarters issued an official report last night, stating that "The enemy continues to attack the Taipale River and the Karelian Isthmus, but has been repelled by our forces. There has been no significant activity by the enemy navy. The enemy air force has bombed the villages of Laskaala and Vammelmansii, but the damage is minimal. Russian aircraft have also strafed civilians on the road in the village of Sustamo with machine guns. Three enemy aircraft have been shot down by our forces. In addition, the Finnish Air Force has also conducted reconnaissance and bombing of enemy trenches. (Haitong, 10th)

London: A telegram has been received here from Finnish commander Meripel in Vyborg stating that extremely fierce fighting is currently taking place in the Karelian Isthmus area. The Soviet side is now deploying reinforcements to attack, but has not broken through the Mannerheim Line at any point. The fighting at Petsamo is quiet. It is reported that Soviet forces are currently trying to secure their lines of communication in that area. The exact number of deaths and injuries in the Helsinki air raids is now 65 dead and 160 injured. Finland has not been subjected to air raids since the third day after the start of the war. (Reuters, 9th)

Moscow: Soviet newspapers are extremely silent on the war today, only publishing vague communiqués. In the days following the outbreak of the war on the Soviet side, reporters specially assigned by Soviet newspapers were extremely active, but they have also stopped their reports since yesterday. (United Press, 10th)

Helsinki: After the Finnish army repeatedly repulsed Soviet troops along the entire line, especially in the Karelian area, morale here was greatly boosted. Because the Red Army originally had an overwhelming advantage in terms of troop strength and equipment, the fact that it has failed to achieve any success after several days of intensive attacks is enough to excite the Finns. As for the Soviet claim that the Red Army has landed in the port of Vyborg, it is purely a fabrication. (Havas, 10th)

Three Goals of Soviet Advance

Helsinki: Soviet troops are fiercely attacking Finnish positions in three areas: the Karelian Isthmus, Lake Ladoga, and the Petsamo region. In the Karelian Isthmus, the snow has stopped and is also melting, which is quite convenient for the Soviet army. The Soviet army is focusing on the fighting north of Lake Ladoga, and yesterday occupied the area of Suomussalmi, 20 kilometers from the Soviet-Finnish border. The Soviet army is clearly attempting to destroy the railway network. Soviet reinforcements are heading to the area, which now has six infantry divisions and one armored car division. The Soviet army's first goal is to take Lexe, and it has already occupied most of the territory between Lexe and the Soviet-Finnish border. The Soviet army's second goal is to destroy the railway between Iisalmi and Nurmes. The third goal is to occupy Kitee, and then attack Salmi on the northeast shore of Lake Ladoga from there. The Soviet army is using heavy tanks to attack the Finnish army on that front. The Finnish Mannerheim Line is a formidable obstacle for the Soviet army. The Soviet Air Force will likely bomb the line after the weather improves. Petsamo is still held by the Finnish army, but the Soviet army was reinforced there yesterday. (Haitong, 9th)

Active Finnish Mobile Units

Helsinki: According to news here, several small squads of Finnish patrols have recaptured several miles of land in certain areas. In other areas, the Soviet pressure is quite strong. The flow of Soviet reinforcements to the front has now stopped. Several Soviet ships have left Petsamo. Soviet forces are currently advancing on the Karelian Isthmus, where Finnish forces are awaiting them in their main defenses. Most of the fighting currently consists of clashes between advancing Soviet troops and Finnish mobile units and hidden machine-gun nests. Attempts by Soviet forces to land on the coast have been thwarted. (Reuters, 9th)

Finnish Troops Fight on Ice Skates

Helsinki: According to news today, Finnish troops in white uniforms attacked Soviet troops today along a two-mile front in far northern Finland while wearing ice skates. The enemy was caught unprepared by the sudden attack, resulting in many casualties. (Reuters, 9th)

### Finnish Envoy to Soviet Union Arrives in Riga

Riga: Finnish envoy to Moscow Koskinen, along with other embassy staff, arrived in Latvia yesterday. Koski immediately traveled to Germany via the capital. It is expected that Koski would arrive in Berlin early in the morning today. It is understood that the Finnish envoy to Russia and other staff originally planned to leave Russia earlier, but the Moscow authorities refused to issue passports until the Moscow diplomatic corps intervened. The Soviet Russian authorities then sent the passports. Upon arriving at the border, they were detained for another ten hours before being released. (Haitong, 10th)

### British Aid to Finns Resist; Supplying Finland with Aircraft

London: Those in charge here claimed that the German wireless recently transmitted that the twenty fighter planes supplied by Britain to Finland were ordered from the United States so as not to hinder British relations with the Soviet government, etc. In fact, these aircraft were all supplied by British companies and were manufactured in Britain. Those in charge in Britain do not conceal British assistance to the Finns in resisting Soviet aggression for fear of a Soviet reaction. (Reuters, 9th)

### League of Nations Council Decides; Finland's Application Handed over to General Assembly for Processing; The Netherlands States It Will Not Participate in Sanctions; Latin American Countries Discuss Common Attitude

Geneva: At the League of Nations Council meeting this afternoon, after Secretary-General Avenol read the correspondence between the League of Nations Secretariat and the Soviet and Finnish countries, the attending representatives exchanged preliminary opinions. The Finnish representative requested that the matter be submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly immediately. After the Council adjourned, the Latin American countries gathered to consider their common attitude. It is widely believed that the Argentine representative strongly advocated expelling the Soviet Union from the League. The chairman of the League of Nations Council is currently Belgian representative Vieydt, while the Soviet Union has not sent a representative to attend. (Reuters, 9th)

Geneva: The League of Nations Council held a secret meeting this afternoon to discuss the Finnish issue. Finnish representative Holsti, the former foreign minister, was also present. The Council immediately decided to transfer the application submitted by Finland to the League of Nations General Assembly for processing. The General Assembly is scheduled to hold a meeting on the 11th of this month. (Havas, 9th)

London: Those in charge in Britain said that the agenda for the League of Nations General Assembly on Monday is roughly as follows: (1) Pass a resolution condemning Soviet aggression; (2) Ask countries not to provide aid to the Soviet Union; (3) Ask countries to provide as much aid to Finland as possible; (4) Ask the Soviet Union to stop the aggression. (Reuters, 9th)

Geneva: Representatives of Latin American countries who are here to participate in the League of Nations General Assembly held an important meeting this afternoon to discuss the Finnish issue in order to determine a common attitude, and advocated electing Bolivian representative Costa du Riel as the chairman of the General Assembly. (Havas, 9th)

The Hague: At the current session of the League of Nations Council, there are as many as five seats for permanent and non-permanent council members whose terms are about to expire. It has been rumored that the Netherlands may be elected to a permanent seat, but according to officials here, the government of the Netherlands has decided not to accept it, considering that Belgium is already a council member and the Scandinavian countries have not yet been able to obtain a seat. As for the dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union, the government of the Netherlands, although sending personnel to attend the General Assembly this time in its capacity as a member state, believes that the League of Nations, with its current organization, does not have sufficient authority to take any action against aggressor countries. For this reason, although the country can join other member states in designating an aggressor country, it is absolutely unwilling to participate in any form of sanctions. (Havas, 9th)

London: The Daily Telegraph's correspondent in Geneva reported that the Argentine representative has issued a statement saying that if the League of Nations cannot declare the Soviet Union out of the League, the country will declare its withdrawal from the League. The country's representative is currently in Geneva wooing representatives of other Latin American countries in order to form a united front and unanimously demand that the League of Nations make a decisive decision. (Havas, 9th)

Rome: According to Istanbul news, Turkish political figures have made many comments on the League of Nations General Assembly, all believing that the League of Nations meeting is difficult to achieve practical results, because only Britain and France are the great powers participating in the League of Nations, which shows that the League of Nations is an unimportant organization. (Haitong, 9th)

Geneva: According to diplomatic sources, it is virtually certain that the League of Nations will condemn the Soviet Union in spirit. As for whether to declare it out of the League, it is not yet certain. What can be asserted now is that it is difficult to implement economic and financial sanctions against the Soviet Union. However, it is likely that a resolution will be passed inviting countries to provide as much assistance to Finland as possible. In this way, countries that have already decided to provide assistance can legally obtain a basis. As of now, Italy has shipped 80 aircraft to Finland, and Britain has supplied the country with 30 aircraft and 60,000 gas masks. (Havas, 10th)

Geneva: Koo Vi-kyuin and Quo Tai-chi arrived here together last night. Early this morning, Koo first visited Soviet representative Stolitz of the Fourth Committee, and then met with representatives of Britain and France to exchange views on the council election issue. Koo may have also explained China's attitude in the General Assembly and the Council. The silence of the British representative this time was quite unexpected. Therefore, the opinion of the League of Nations members regarding the expulsion of the Soviet Union has changed somewhat. The British representative also refused to issue any statements or comments to journalists. According to semi-official observations, Britain seems to approve of censuring the Soviet Union and providing practical economic and financial assistance to Finland. Britain seems to oppose the expulsion of the Soviet Union. A secret meeting of the Council was held this morning, which only discussed procedural issues and will be held again this afternoon to discuss the Soviet-Finnish conflict. (9th)

### Sweden Decides to Maintain Peace

Stockholm: Defense Minister Nilsson recently delivered a speech, stating in brief, "Sweden is determined to do everything possible to maintain peace. However, this is not something we can decide alone. Order, justice, social progress, and national freedom are all values of life and must be maintained. If others want to deprive us of them, we have no choice but to rise up and defend ourselves. All the military measures our country has taken recently are purely for the purpose of maintaining neutrality. For example, when a fire breaks out in a neighbor's house, everyone knows to take precautionary measures, which is only a matter of reason. (Havas, 10th)

Stockholm: Lieutenant General Tonney, the Chief of the General Staff, has recently been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the entire country. He immediately issued a letter to the soldiers of the entire country, stating in brief, "Under the current circumstances, our urgent task is to defend the country's freedom and rights. Whether the country is safe or not depends on the determination and belief of the people. It is hoped that the soldiers of the entire country will be able to fulfill their duties so that the country can be placed on the safety of a rock." (Havas, 10th)

### Italian-Hungarian Military Talks

Rome: According to reports, a military delegation sent by the Hungarian government has arrived here and will immediately hold talks with the Italian authorities. (Havas, 9th)

### British Indian Army Drills in the Desert

Amsterdam - London Daily Telegraph reports: British troops and British-controlled Indian troops are concentrated in the Egyptian desert, not far from Giza. It is reported that infantry and artillery units are drilling in the desert to familiarize themselves with desert conditions and life. (Sea Transport Telegram, 10th)

### Great Britain, France, Soviet Union and Other Countries Continue to Aid China - Hu Shih Speaks in New York

New York - Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shih gave a speech yesterday at a luncheon of the Foreign Policy Association, stating that China firmly believes that the Soviet Union, Great Britain, France, and other countries will continue to aid China in resisting Japan. Although the Soviet Union plans to sign a new trade agreement with Japan, Soviet aid to China will continue. "To this day, the Soviet Union has not indicated that it will abandon its policy of aiding China." Great Britain and France have only reduced a small portion of their troops stationed in North China, and they may make "other small concessions" to Japan within possible limits. He stated, "But we firmly believe that Great Britain and France will continue to allow China to transport munitions through French Indochina and British Burma. When China fights for survival and independence, Great Britain and France will not betray or abandon China. If democratic countries betray China halfway, it will forcefully overturn their so-called war aims and peace aims." Japan "decided to crush the National Government before it achieves stability and strength," so it began war against China. The isolationist policies of the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and the United States allowed Japan to act freely in China. However, China's resistance has achieved the "good result of startling the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and the United States," who were sleeping comfortably. (United Press, 10th)

### US Republican Party Advocates Severing Relations with the Soviet Union - Vandenberg Sends Letter to Hull

Washington - Republican Senator Vandenberg, a candidate for the party in next year's election, recently sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull, demanding the severance of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. He said that the countries of South America are extremely indignant at the Soviet invasion of Finland. Some countries have even demanded that the League of Nations declare the Soviet Union out of the League. The timely severance of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union is a good opportunity to demonstrate Pan-American solidarity. (Havas, 9th)

### French Government Confiscates Communist Party Property

Geneva - According to news received from Paris, the French government today issued a decree confiscating all the property and funds of the French Communist Party organization, except for those related to maternal and child health funds, which are not confiscated but transferred to non-communist charitable organizations for safekeeping. (Sea Transport Telegram, 10th)

Geneva - After severely cracking down on communist propaganda, the French government found that the Communist Party has not ceased its activities. Because Communist Party organizations and newspapers have been closed down by the secret police, they have switched to using slogans and leaflets to continue propaganda in various provinces. (Sea Transport Telegram, 9th)

### Assassination Incident Occurs on German Southern Border - German Customs Officers Assassinated

Vienna - According to news received here, on the evening of the 8th of this month, two German customs officers were assassinated at the border between Germany and Yugoslavia. One, Reiner, noticed a suspicious person near the German-South border south of Graz. When he went to question him, he was shot and killed. A customs officer named Marcel, from a nearby post, was also shot and killed in succession. It is believed that the two cases were committed by the same murderer, and a reward has been offered for his arrest. (Sea Transport Telegram, 10th)

### Soviet Icebreaker to Sail Out of Arctic Region

Moscow - The Soviet icebreaker "Sedov" has been trapped in Arctic ice floes for more than two years. According to the Soviet Arctic Navigation Committee, the ship is currently drifting towards navigable waters. It is reported that the "Sedov" recently sent a radio message reporting its location at 83.27 degrees north latitude and 5.37 degrees east longitude. The crew is safe. The Soviet government has decided to send the largest icebreaker, the "Stalin," to rescue the "Sedov." The Arctic auxiliary ship "Maudanaz," currently docked in the Greenland Sea, has also been ordered to assist. (Sea Transport Telegram, 10th)

### Japanese Ship Azuma Maru Has Not Sunk - Sailing in the Atlantic

Tokyo - Foreign news reported that the Japanese ship "Azuma Maru" sent a distress signal off the coast of Scotland. Nippon Yusen Kaisha received a telegram from the captain of the ship at 11:55 p.m. on the 9th, stating that the ship is now safely sailing in the Atlantic and is scheduled to arrive in Panama on the 20th. (Domei News Agency, 10th)

London - No news has been received since the Japanese cargo ship "Azuma Maru" sent a distress signal off the coast of Scotland yesterday. Although the London Japanese Shipping Company sent a radio message to communicate with the ship, it has not been successful. (Reuters, 9th)

### Rumor that Turkish Government Demands Recall of German Ambassador

Danjing - The political newspaper correspondent stationed in Berlin recently telegraphed that the Turkish government has reportedly requested Germany to recall its ambassador to Turkey, Papen. The ambassador returned to Turkey on the 7th of this month to report on everything. According to reports, the German Embassy in Turkey recently published a booklet that criticized the host country in many ways. Ambassador Papen is dissatisfied with the Berlin government, likely for this reason. (Havas, 10th)

### The United States Joins with Central and South America in Strategy to Combat International Propaganda - Fear of German-Italian Expansion after the Outbreak of the Second European War

Propaganda, a new term that emerged from the First European War. It is still remembered that a Japanese military attache stationed in a certain country at the time received a telegram from the government ordering him to quickly investigate and reply with an explanation of this term. Readers who pay attention to diplomatic anecdotes may still recall this. Furthermore, in the first few years after its discovery, there was no definite assessment of whether international propaganda was good or bad. Our Chinese literati refer to the act of praising others' good deeds as "flaunting." Although propaganda is similar to flaunting, its scope is not limited to individuals, and its effect is not limited to praising good deeds. The meaning of propaganda is broader and not entirely the same as flaunting. Today, the cry for "total war" (literally translated as "total war") is widespread everywhere. The propaganda strategy, which was regarded as an unsurpassed treasure by the belligerent countries twenty years ago, has become old and outdated. However, North and South America, which are concerned about being implicated in the war, are enriching large-scale investigation organizations, relying on industrial efforts to prevent "sabotage," and using commercial means to prevent "espionage," and rising up to counter propaganda. Under the guidance of US Attorney General Murphy, the New York Federal Bureau of Investigation has branches in all forty-eight states of the United States, as well as overseas territories and possessions, from Alaska in the north to Puerto Rico in Central America and Cuba in the south, and from the Panama Canal Zone on the east coast of the Pacific to Honolulu and the Philippines in the center of the Pacific, all of which have stationed officials to exchange information. On the surface, the foreign secret combinations that these people guard against seem to be aimed solely at dictatorships and communism, but in reality, they strictly prevent all propaganda against the United States by strong Eastern and Western powers, as well as other neutral countries. Even cultural propaganda and scenic tourism propaganda are not immune to suspicion and surveillance. The two main things they are most committed to preventing are: Firstly, the lectures given by educators in class, which affect the future of a country through subtle and profound influences. Everyone should have a clear declaration as to whether anyone within the country is using education to secretly promote other countries, so as to establish a guarantee for the security of the country. Secondly, aircraft factories in the western United States are important for national defense and should not be allowed to harbor hidden dangers. Recently, it has been heard that the investigative agencies have been thoroughly screening the family history and experience of aircraft factory personnel to prevent spies from mixing in. A further step in their preventive measures is to expose the two main objectives of a certain dictatorship's propaganda against the United States: one is to secretly plot to change the existing political system of the United States, and the other is to induce useful money to leak out and go astray for other purposes. Therefore, the most urgent task of the "Pan-American Conference" held in the capital of Panama in September and October of this year was to expand the defense line of "countering foreign propaganda" and form a unified joint defense of North, Central, and South America. The main points are no more than four: Firstly, urge the countries of Central and South America to continue to work hard to eliminate foreign shares in the aviation industry and withdraw foreign agency personnel in order to contain the threat of war. Secondly, in view of the excessive length of the coastline in Central and South America, do not allow submarines of certain countries to secretly establish bases there, and especially do not allow a small number of foolish people to secretly store fuel and other materials along the coast to supply foreign submarines in order to strengthen the inner walls. Thirdly, do not allow Europeans to suddenly rise up to instigate riots in Central and South America, where people from all five directions live together, so as not to be driven by foreign soldiers. Fourthly, if those who incite riots have no chance to take advantage of, then the "differentiation" movement, which is a more moderate approach, is also on the list of precautions. All of these four points are sufficient to show the eagerness to avoid chaos and the depth of concern of the American government and people. At the same time, they also show the common psychology of Americans fearing the gradual westward expansion of German power. The ancient gentleman had the admonition of preparing without ceasing. Americans can be worthy of it without shame.

### Random Notes on an Eastern Journey (First Letter)

— Zhang Changren

A Few Words

In November of the 28th year of the Republic of China, this reporter departed from Guilin, with Ningbo as the destination, planning to travel across the hinterland of the four provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Zhejiang.

Although the Sino-Japanese war is currently accelerating towards total war, there are still three main battlefields in North China, Central China, and South China. Based on current trends, it is speculated that the battles on the North China and South China battlefields are still limited to "covering" and "containing." The decisive battle will still originate in the central battlefield north and south of the Yangtze River. Taking Germany in the First World War as an example of the victory or defeat of modern warfare, without a substantial and sound rear, the victory of the front line is also in vain. The purpose of traveling in the hinterland of the four provinces is to inspect the various phenomena in the rear of the central battlefield south of the Yangtze River and reproduce them in writing before the readers, hoping that they can be comforting, correctable, cautionary, or evaluative. If it is desired to use this as a divination tool to seek victory and national construction, then I am afraid that it is beyond the ability of this reporter's observations and writing skills.

This article is written and sent along the way. The selection of themes is quite complex, and the structure of the text is even more difficult to achieve in a systematic way. Therefore, it is titled "Random Notes." Zhang Changren, traveling in Ji'an, Jiangxi—

1.  In the Xiang-Gui Train

At half past six on the night of November 12th, this reporter took an express train from Guilin South Station heading north. The blue steel train, which had traveled south from Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, Longhai, Ping-Han, and Yue-Han, still maintained its inherent beauty and comfort. It was one month after the great victory of the Battle of Northern Hunan. The military and civilians in the great rear of the Southwest were all optimistic about the current war situation with boiling emotions. After the train started, the passengers began to exchange conversations, using various different interpretations to prove the inevitability of victory in the war of resistance. The calm emotions made people feel as if they were on the night express train in Beijing and Shanghai that year.

Among the fellow travelers was Staff Officer Sun of the ____ Army, who talked about the future of the war from a military perspective, with quite unique insights. The conclusion of the talk was that the hard struggle of the whole country for the past two and a half years had yielded results. However, the closer victory is, the more difficult the battle will be. The so-called "he who walks a hundred miles is halfway at ninety," and one basketful of earth is truly enough to serve as a warning and encouragement to the people of the country today as they grasp the threads of victory and move forward towards a bright future. It was not until late at night that everyone went to bed.

The Xiang-Gui Railway, which will soon be open to traffic on the Guilin-Liuzhou section, has gradually normalized the train services on the Hengyang-Guilin section. The 360 kilometers between Guilin and Liuzhou used to take 18 hours to complete the entire journey, and there were still occasional delays. Now, only 12 hours are needed. This line was built by pooling the talents, materials, and resources of railways from all over the country and expending the sweat and blood labor of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Hunan and Guangxi. In the year since it opened to traffic, it has made its greatest efforts to contribute to the cause of national construction and will soon exert its great potential in the national defense of the Southwest.

2.  Hengyang in Expansion

Since the great fire in Changsha and the interruption of the "Zhe-Gan" Railway, Hengyang has leaped to become the transportation hub of the five provinces of Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. In terms of railways, the Yue-Han Railway can reach Lukou in the north and Youjiang in the south, and the Xiang-Gui Railway can reach Liuzhou. In terms of highways, the Xiang-Qian, Xiang-Gui, Xiang-Yue, Xiang-Gan, and Heng(yang)-Xiang(tan) lines all radiate from here. In terms of waterways, it can be traced north along the Xiang River to Tongtan River and south downstream to Changsha and Xiangyin. The convenience of water and land transportation not only forms a major stronghold in military terms but also gradually becomes the center of Hunan's politics and economy. Hengyang can be proud of this.

However, Hengyang has thus become one of the main bombing targets of the Japanese Air Force in Central China. The city has been turned into ruins, and the nearby villages are also suffering from time to time. However, Hengyang has never surrendered and is actively expanding towards the suburbs to confront Japanese aerial violence in a stronger and larger posture.

Six months ago, this reporter had counted the houses in this area, but now they are gradually new and must be looked at with new eyes. The scorched earth in the city has gradually been covered by newly built houses. A large hotel that can accommodate hundreds of people is also under construction with temple capital. The city's defenses are being dismantled, and the streets are being actively widened. Outside the city, unnamed avenues are radiating towards the suburbs. New houses are neatly dotted on the red soil plains, and their structures are simpler and more practical than the old houses. New markets are also increasing on both sides of the road. Most of the shopkeepers come from the occupied areas and have reversed the national habit of "being content to live in one's native land" and become philosophers of "being content wherever one is." However, they are by no means "so happy here that they forget Shu." They avidly read newspapers, eagerly discuss the current situation, and are ready to advance with the victorious battle at any time. The Dagang Daily and the Zhengzhong Daily are published earlier than in other cities and can be bought after 7:00 a.m. In addition, there is also a theater showing old domestic films.

The Hunan Provincial Government stipulates that every day from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. is "air defense time" (except for rain and snow). The city gates and passes are monitored by the garrison, and all soldiers and civilians are "allowed to go out but not allowed to enter." Therefore, there is no market during the day, and the residents also move to the nearby villages in droves. As a result, the teahouses and restaurants outside the city are often full of guests. However, although the casualties from air raids can be expected to decrease as a result, the time that residents spend regularly is inevitably too much. It is heard that "how to use air defense time" is now a topic for some people in Hengyang, and they are eager for the provincial government to have a way to teach them.

3.  Overnight Stay in Chaling

There used to be shuttle buses connecting Hengyang and Ji'an, Jiangxi, but recently, due to the priority supply of transportation and materials for military use, one bus is now dispatched from Laiyang every day to facilitate travel between the two provinces. Passengers traveling from the Southwest to the Southeast provinces can take a train from Hengyang on the Yue-Han Railway to Laiyang, transfer to a highway bus to Jiehua on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi (fare 8 yuan and 7 jiao), and transfer to a Jiangxi Highway Administration bus to Ji'an (156 kilometers, fare 8 yuan and 6 jiao). However, the demand far exceeds the supply, and it is difficult to purchase tickets. Fortunately, the highway administrations of the two provinces handle passenger registration conscientiously. Registered passengers can definitely get on the road in at most two days.

Because this reporter had the convenience of a ____ Department vehicle driving to Jiangxi, he left Hengyang at 10:00 a.m. on the 17th, arrived in Laiyang at 1:00 p.m., and at this point diverged from the Xiang-Yue Highway. Crossing the Lai River eastward through Anren County, he arrived in Chaling at 5:00 p.m. Along the way, many coal mountains were seen, and coal seams were exposed on the ground everywhere. The local people are extracting it using indigenous methods, and those who carry it into the market on their shoulders are on the road. If it can be actively guided and assisted, and scientific methods can be used for excavation, and light rails can be laid to facilitate transportation, the fuel problems in the cities of southern Hunan and northern Guangdong may be completely solved.

Chaling is one of the remote counties in southern Hunan, and in reality, it is only a relatively large town. Because it is located in the center of the Xiang-Gan Highway, vehicles coming from the east and going to the west must stay overnight here. Therefore, the hotel industry is exceptionally developed. The hotels and restaurants near the bus station are lined up and are still relatively cheap. The streets are right-angled, and they have not been ravaged by Japanese aircraft. The people's lives seem to be very peaceful.

4.  A Glimpse of Lianhua

At dawn on the 18th, we set off east from Chaling and passed Jiehualong at around 9:00 a.m. Several military police were stationed here to check passing vehicles and soldiers and civilians. This lonely small village is also becoming more prosperous due to the passengers waiting for buses here. After this, we entered the territory of Lianhua County in Jiangxi Province.

The highways in Jiangxi Province are slightly narrower than those in Hunan Province and are less repaired. The road surface is damaged and uneven. This line was a military road during the past civil war. Where culverts should be used, small wooden bridges are mostly used instead. They have not been rebuilt for several years, and damage can be seen from time to time. If the driver is slightly careless or drives at night, there is a risk of accidents. For the sake of facilitating military transportation, the Jiangxi Provincial Highway Administration needs to repair or rebuild it immediately.

Lianhua used to be one of the Red Army's base areas. It is said that all parts of the county were once battlefields. Now, times have changed, and it is difficult to recover the traces of the past. The bunkers on the mountain passes have begun to be demolished. The bricks and stones, which were taken from the people in the past, have now been returned to the people for building houses and filling roads. The working farmers are mostly happy to carry them, thinking they can be used to build houses and fill roads. One of the city walls of Lianhua was completely leveled by mobilizing the entire county's population from October 1st to 15th. The houses in the cities and villages have whitewashed walls and black roofs, and they are tall and solid, like those of prominent families, which can be called the characteristic of Lianhua. Bamboo fences and thatched huts are only occasionally seen. However, the lives of the farmers are still very poor.

When the bus stopped near the bus station, an old man bowed on the side of the road, speaking with a northern Anhui accent, and invited us to dine at the "Refugee Hotel of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi," which was jointly opened by refugees from the four provinces. This reporter and Mr. Chen had a meal together, which included fresh mushrooms, fried bamboo shoots, sliced meat with cabbage, scrambled eggs with scallions, braised tofu, egg soup, and rice, and it only cost 6 jiao and 6 fen. This area is a rice-producing area in Jiangxi Province, and rice is sold for 6 yuan per dan, and eggs are 40 per yuan. It can be seen that although the cost of living in cities has continued to rise in the 30 months of China's war of resistance, most cities and villages, except for daily necessities, can still maintain a normal state. However, due to transportation reasons, only one and a half catties of edible salt can be purchased per yuan. At 3:00 p.m., we passed Anfu County, where most of the civilians were working hard to demolish the city walls. One hour later, we arrived in Ji'an, an important town in central Jiangxi. (Ji'an, November 20th)

### Huang Dawei Leads Bandits to Disturb the Fujian Border, Heading Towards Zhanglin and Huanggang to Spy on the Zhao'an Watershed

Shantou Correspondence: Huang Dawei, who calls himself the "First Group Army of the National Construction Pacification Army," with approximately 2,000 men under his command, has occupied Chao'an, Anbu, and Chenghai, and actually uses "Peace to Save the Country" as a slogan to deceive the ignorant people of Chaozhou and Shantou. The Japanese army arrests young people in Chaozhou and Shantou, transports them to Nanao and Xiamen for training, and then forcibly sends them to various battlefields. However, young people arrested from other places are slightly trained and then transported to Shantou to be taken in and replenished by Huang. The so-called puppet pacification army is actually made up of scattered soldiers, hooligans, and bandits. Whenever young people with a slight sense of national identity are sent out to guard posts, they take the opportunity to escape with their guns or defect to the Chinese army. As for the puppet army stationed in Chenghai, they are closely monitored by the Japanese, and their military discipline is also extremely bad. On the evening of the 27th, the puppet unit crossed the Lianyangcheng River and immediately carried out arson in the three societies of Su Nan district, upper, middle and lower. The Chinese army's Li Shaoru Hong Zhizheng and other units recently retreated towards Zhanglin, Longdu, Lianhuashan, Fushan, Tangxiqiao, Raoping territory. The puppet army took the opportunity to invade, and the strong men of Nanyang's upper, middle and lower three societies immediately rose up to fight. At that time, three Japanese planes flew out of Nanao to assist in the battle, and four Japanese warships approached Zhalin Bay, Huanggang, Haishan, Jingzhou, and Yanzao to spy, firing cannons to assist in the attack and prevent the Chinese army from retreating back to the coastal villages and towns. The mountains and ridges of the counties along the Fujian-Guangdong border, such as Raoping, Zhao'an, Pinghe, Yongding, and Dapu, are high and steep, forming a natural boundary between the two provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. The Fenshui Pass in Zhao'an and the Songbai Pass in Pinghe are both land routes for the transportation of goods between the two provinces. After the sea routes were blocked, land transportation was fortunately still smooth. Many of the local people went abroad to make a living, while those who stayed in the mainland made a living by fishing and farming. Since the war of resistance, those who lived by fishing and salt have been greatly affected. Fortunately, the agricultural products have been abundant, and the government has paid attention to adjusting food and grains and dredging overseas remittances. Therefore, the social situation and the people's lives are still very stable. Last month, Huang Dawei secretly sent traitors into the Fujian-Guangdong border area to probe the movements of the Chinese army and the collection and transportation of materials. The authorities received secret reports from various districts and villages and had long anticipated that Huang would disturb southern Fujian. Yongding, Pinghe, Zhao'an, Raoping, Huanggang and other places have also often found absurd propaganda items. On the afternoon of the 28th, the 7th Army of Huang's puppet army that entered Lianyang was defeated by the militia and retreated back to Chenghai City. However, the puppet 1st Army mixed with Japanese infantry, artillery and cavalry, occupied Zhanglin, and there were also 20 motorboats that suddenly broke into the Donglong River from the north and south ports and ditches. The Chinese army there retreated to Tongcheng, Raoping, overnight. The women and children had already moved away. The highway from Zhanglin to Huanggang was thoroughly destroyed by the Chinese army and could not be used. The Japanese navy used motorboats instead of vehicles to supply Huang's puppet 1st Army for its eastward advance. Yanzao, Pinzhou, and Haishan were landed on by Japanese army battle teams on the 29th. Huang's puppet troops then advanced to Gushaobridge, 12 li from Huanggang. However, this bridge had been destroyed in advance. Hong Zhizheng and Huang Shaochu led the militia to retreat to the Jiuxi Bridge and the Centipede Mountain Range, launching a flank attack. The mountain range and the highway run parallel to each other, extending east from Zhanglin to Jiuxi Bridge, a distance of 20 li. There are no trees on the mountain, only yellow mud and granite. On the 29th, fierce fighting took place between the two armies in this section. Japanese aircraft from Nanao, commanded by Suzuki, took turns dropping dozens of bombs on Jiuxi Bridge and Centipede Mountain. The Chinese forces were forced to retreat, turning to hold the Qian Dongwei and the highway to Tangxi to protect Raoping City. On the morning of the 30th, Huang's puppet 1st Army occupied Huanggang, leading 500 Japanese soldiers, attacking Shencun, Zhelin, (a salt-producing area), and the Fenshui Pass on the border of Zhao'an. From Huanggang to Fenshuling, it is about 18 li, and the ridge is 20 li from Zhao'an City. The road is a low-lying plain area with no defenses to hold. There is a mountain five li outside Zhao'an City, and there is an airfield under the mountain. Now, the Chinese army is holding the Dushan Mountain at the border between Fenshuling and Zhelin. Japanese warships can be seen on the sea from the mountain. The mountain ridge is slightly steep, with strange rocks. It has been occupied by the sea bandit Yang Lu and his men for many years. Huang's puppet army is now divided into nine teams, totaling about 2,000 men. There are also 600 Japanese soldiers. Along the coast, in the occupied villages, there are hundreds of Japanese marines in each place. It is heard that the Japanese and puppet troops' invasion of southern Fujian this time is advancing eastward along the first trunk line of the provincial road. The purpose of the attack is to expand the area and obtain food supplies, which is of great political and economic significance. Huang Dawei's external propaganda aims to establish a puppet Fujian provincial autonomy and protect the ancestral graves of overseas Chinese.

### Beiping Muslims Clash with Japanese

Beiping Special Dispatch: The Beiping Islamic General Association, sponsored by the Japanese, and its affiliated Islamic Youth Corps, recently had a dispute with the Tianqiao Theater while watching a play. The Japanese instructor mishandled the situation, and more than 600 Beiping Muslims went to the association to protest. The Japanese actually telegraphed the military police to suppress them with force. Before the military police arrived, six Japanese men, seeing the Muslims' fierce momentum, fled one after another. The Muslims then disbanded the Youth Corps, and the Islamic Association also went on a general strike. After much explanation by the Beiping Special Affairs Agency of Japan, it was ineffective. The Japanese Islamic movement suffered a great blow as a result of this case.

### Military Suppression of Bandits in Fujian to End Soon; Zhang Xiongnan's Forces Scattered; Meizhou Island Recaptured for the Third Time

Fuzhou Correspondence: After Zhang Xiongnan, the former third Brigade Commander of the Provincial Security Corps, rebelled, he immediately communicated with a certain party and accepted a false order from Huang Dawei of Shantou. He led more than 3,000 troops and entrenched himself in the border areas of Yongchun, Dehua, Xianyou, Datian, Yongtai, and other counties, enticing young men to join, extorting huge sums from local areas, and trying to expand his strength to disrupt the Fujian situation. The authorities appointed Huang Zhenwu, Director of the Security Department, as the Chief Commander for the suppression of bandits in central Fujian, and Wang Menggu, Administrative Inspector of the Fourth District, as the Deputy Commander. They dispatched a large army and divided it into several routes to suppress the bandits, recovering the bandit areas one after another. The bewitched young men also turned against the bandits one after another. The bandit forces were becoming increasingly desperate. In mid-November, the main force of the bandit troops, numbering more than 1,000, fled to Tuyunqi, the most solid fortress on Daiyun Mountain, the most dangerous mountain at the junction of Yongchun and Dehua counties, and resisted stubbornly. They also sent teams to guard the mountain paths around the mountain. The bandit suppression troops dispatched teams to search and advance along several routes. After three days and nights of contact, they finally reached the outer perimeter of Tuyunqi mountain stronghold. Zhang Xiongnan and Zhou Guanghui (the false Chief of Staff) then led more than 400 people and fled to the border between Dehua and Xianyou via the secret path between Shitiyan and Shuifuyan. Zhang Chengfu and Lei Zhenhua, two false Brigade Commanders, still led more than 400 people and stubbornly defended the stronghold. The stronghold was surrounded by cliffs and steep walls, making it extremely difficult to attack. The bandit suppression troops launched fierce attacks from all sides, and on the 21st, they finally broke through the stronghold. Zhang Chengfu and Lei Zhenhua each led more than 100 remnants and fled to Yingkeng and Guiyang in Dehua. It is estimated that more than 100 bandits were killed and more than 70 guns were seized. Now that the bandit nest has been broken through and the main force has been defeated, teams are being sent to pursue and suppress the remnants, and they will be wiped out in a few days. Large and small islands along the coast of eastern Fujian, such as Pingtan, Nanri, Meizhou, Dongsha, Nangan, and Chuanshi, have been successively occupied by pirates as bases for invading coastal counties such as Fuqing, Putian, Lianjiang, and Changle. Pingtan was once recovered in September, but then fell again. Meizhou has been recovered twice, but both times it was seized by pirates taking advantage of the opportunity. On the night of November 22, a certain elite unit crossed the sea from a certain place in Putian and landed on the western corner of Meizhou. They first killed the pirate sentries and went straight to the Mazu Temple, the headquarters of the pirate puppet command. The pirates woke up from their dreams, caught off guard, and 70 people were killed. The pirate leader Huang Yushu was also killed on the spot, and his head was sent to the county town of Putian for public display. To prevent the pirates from making a comeback, the troops are organizing the masses on the island, reorganizing the Baojia system, and building defensive fortifications. Yu A'huang, the pirate leader entrenched in Pingtan, has recently extorted money from the nearby small islands of Jiangyin and Tangyu, ranging from more than 10,000 yuan to several tens of thousands of yuan, demanding that it be paid within ten days, otherwise, he will plunder them. The fishermen of these islands have always had strong self-defense capabilities, and they are extremely angry upon hearing the news and are actively preparing to resist.

### War News from Southern Shandong and Jiaodong: Japanese Troops in Tai'an Pressure the Battle

Japanese troops in Shandong Province have recently been constantly harassing the Chinese army's positions, but there have been no large-scale fierce battles. The following is a record: (1) More than 500 Japanese troops gathered in Zaozhuang, passed through Teng County, and arrived in Taierzhuang. On the 10th, they encountered the Chinese army in a fierce battle for several hours in front of Zhaishan, 30 li southwest of Taierzhuang. The Japanese army was defeated and retreated to its original location. (2) A part of the Japanese troops in Rizhao harassed Tao Luo on the 11th. After being intercepted by the Chinese army, the Japanese army's retreat was cut off, and they fled back to the city. (3) More than 150 Japanese troops in Jiaodong invaded Laiyang to the east. On the 10th, they met with the Japanese troops invading the south of Gaomi County in Nanshu. On the 11th, they advanced to Shuigoutou in the southeast of Laiyang. On the same day, the Japanese troops in Jimo also invaded the north on various routes, and they are all in a standoff with the Chinese army.

The Japanese troops stationed in Dawenkou are mixed with White Russians, who specialize in reconnaissance work. If they encounter soldiers in various units who have divergent thoughts and take active actions, they secretly report to the upper military department for strict punishment. Among the Japanese troops stationed in Tai'an, the Morikawa unit has more than 200 people. Because of their strong anti-war sentiments and a plan for a riot, the Japanese military officers learned of this and sent all of them to Qingdao. It is reported that Lieutenant Colonel Morikawa has committed suicide to take responsibility.

### Flourishing Opium, Gambling, and Prostitution in Kunshan; Puppet Organizations Collect Money from Them

Kunshan Correspondence: After the war in Kunshan, it is full of scars. Although the stores on the main street have gradually recovered, most of them are outwardly strong but inwardly weak. There are very few with capital of more than 10,000 yuan. In this situation, opium, gambling, and prostitution have surpassed all other industries. According to investigations, the opium atmosphere in Kunshan was strictly prohibited before the war, and 80 to 90 percent of addicts had quit. However, after the fall, the puppet county government first lifted the ban on opium. Now, it has become even worse, establishing a puppet Anti-Smoking Bureau and openly setting up anti-smoking clinics, nominally to quit smoking, but in reality to collect money. At present, there are more and more people who have relapsed into addiction. There are about 60 to 70 anti-smoking clinics in the urban area and various villages, all of which are thriving. It can be seen that Kunshan has been severely poisoned. Gambling in Kunshan is because it is the time when the autumn harvest is on the market. Those returning home to harvest are mostly abundant, and rice prices are soaring. Generally, farmers have a lot of surplus. Local ruffians take the opportunity to set up gambling dens and collect commissions from gambling. Pitiful, ignorant farmers mostly fall into their trap. The puppet county police station collects illicit money from them every day. The gambling style in the villages is unprecedented. Kunshan is known as a land of culture and civilization. The establishment of brothels started after the war. Ruffians such as Zhang San and others, in the name of prospering the market, hired more than a dozen prostitutes from Suzhou and set up brothels in Qiandunjiao straight and in the city. Because of this, ordinary lewd teenagers flock to them. Cases of people being ruined because of playing with prostitutes are often heard.

### A Major Fire in Hupu, Changshu; Seventy-Five Households Burned Down

Changshu Correspondence: Hupu in the east township was the most prosperous town before the war, with dense population, rows of shops, and convenient port access. After the war, it also experienced abnormal development for a time, but after being disturbed, it has gradually declined. At about 1:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, Wei Fenghuo's house in Tangdong of the town was negligent. At that time, the wind was strong and there was a lack of firefighting equipment. In an instant, the fire spread in all directions. The flames soared into the sky and the cries shook the wilderness. By dawn, a total of 75 households and 116 thatched and tile houses had been burned down. One person was burned to death and many were injured. It was an unprecedented disaster. At present, there is no proper solution for those who are homeless and exposed to the wind and dew.

### The Suffering of the People in Baoshan: Legal Tender Hidden at Home Confiscated; Grain Prevented from Entering

Baoshan Correspondence: More than 100 new Japanese troops have arrived in Luodian and are searching house to house. Those who answer vaguely are shot. The shop assistants in various shops are forced to organize bamboo pole gun teams, each with a bamboo pole topped with a half-rusted bayonet. The Japanese army extracts one person and appoints him as an instructor. The Japanese army also issued a notice that 50 yuan of national currency hidden at home will be confiscated. Below 50 yuan, they can generally go to the Japanese army headquarters to exchange for Japanese currency. Corner tickets have disappeared. The substitute vouchers and stamps issued by the stores are still very popular. The county is not a rice-producing area. The autumn harvest is over, and people are using bran, rice chaff, and vegetable roots to fill their hunger. At first, rice was transported from Jiading to supply the people. However, after the new Japanese troops arrived in Luodian, rice from the west was generally blocked, and this has been going on for many days. There are nearly 1,000 puppet "Peace and National Salvation Army" troops in the area of Shengqiao, Wusong, and Yanghang. It is said that they were bought and reorganized from the troops of guerrillas Fan Shilin and Lu Axiang. Fan and Lu were appointed as puppet brigade commanders and deputy brigade commanders. However, a certain team leader named Jin refused to submit and has been arrested and killed by the army.

### Speculators and Monopolists Hoarding Rice Not Protected by Two Concessions; Will Be Deported and Stocks Confiscated; Citizens Can Report to Police Commissioner; Municipal Council Scheduled to Discuss Overall Grain Issues Today

Yesterday (10th), the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council jointly issued a notice, the original text of which is as follows: "Notice: It has been found that some people, greedy for personal gain and disregarding the plight of the poor, are hoarding, speculating, and monopolizing rice, causing the main food of the Chinese people to be very expensive at present, which is detrimental to the maintenance of the public order and good governance of the French Concession and the International Settlement of Shanghai. This is to announce that anyone who commits the above-mentioned acts will not be protected by the two concessions and may even be deported, and their stocks will be confiscated. It is hoped that all people, for the sake of the public interest, will report any hoarding, speculation, or monopolization of rice to the police commissioner of the French Concession or the International Settlement, providing detailed information so that they can be investigated and prosecuted. This is hereby announced."

### Bureau Convened a Special Meeting

The soaring rice prices in Shanghai are related to the livelihood of ordinary people and the security of the concessions. The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement is very concerned and has been secretly planning to stabilize prices and is in close contact with the French Concession authorities to jointly plan the implementation. According to reports from the Dazhong News Agency, the Municipal Council held a special meeting on the morning of the 9th to discuss the problem of soaring rice prices affecting people's food. Mr. Fessenden, Director-General and Chairman of the Bureau, and Sir Calder Marshall, Chairman of the Bureau's Food and Fuel Supply Committee, and other important officials attended. The meeting lasted a long time. According to recent records of bureau meetings, although the content has not been announced, it is generally observed that there may be very important decisions. Yesterday, although it was Sunday, the bureau suddenly issued a notice jointly with the French Concession authorities to ban rice speculators, which shows the determination of the authorities of the two concessions to take action. The Dazhong News Agency learned from reliable sources yesterday that the Municipal Council's Food and Fuel Supply Committee is scheduled to convene a special meeting today to discuss the overall issue of food rice in Shanghai, which will be chaired by Sir Marshall of the committee.

### Price Limit Too High; Still Hoping to Suppress

After the rice price broke records and rose again, the authorities of the two concessions and various public groups are urgently seeking ways to suppress it. The former Bean and Rice Industry Association convened an emergency meeting and accepted the Municipal Council's intention to temporarily set the highest price limit for white rice at 45 yuan per stone and Ke Xian rice at 38 yuan. Everyone understands the authorities' concern for people's food and their painstaking efforts. However, according to the general opinions of various Chinese people in society, this price limit is still considered too high, because the general common people and ordinary wage-earning class have little monthly income. The vast majority of citizens still find it difficult to have enough to eat. After the rice price increase, all commodities are expensive, and the panic of life is still seriously threatened. This price limit means that the hoarding households who are speculating and manipulating have not been hit. It is hoped that the concession authorities and the rice industry will consider the hardships of the people's livelihood and quickly suppress the price limit again, so that speculators and manipulators have no way to use their skills, and maintain the prosperity and security of the concession. The authorities should adopt the opinions of the majority of citizens and reconsider the price limit issue.

### Bean and Rice Association Announced Measures

After the main industry groups convened emergency meetings for days to discuss ways to suppress and stabilize rice prices, the Bean and Rice Industry Association issued a public announcement yesterday after the meeting the day before yesterday (9th), as follows: "It has been found that rice prices have been rising recently, which is very important to people's livelihood and security. We are constantly trying to remedy this in order to achieve balance. The Association, considering the importance of this matter, specially convened an emergency meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee on the 9th of this month, and the Market Management Committee sent representatives to attend the meeting. After detailed discussion, in addition to discussing various fundamental policies, which will be handled separately, the following are the palliative aspects: (1) Accepting the Municipal Council's intention, from the 10th of this month, the highest price of white rice shall not exceed 45 yuan per stone, and foreign rice and Ke Xian rice shall not exceed 38 yuan per stone. Du rice and foreign Xian rice are not included in this example. For those who have traded before the 9th of this month, the transaction price will be settled. The above-mentioned price limit shall be strictly enforced by the Market Management Committee. Those who violate it shall be reported to the concession authorities for severe punishment. (2) The Market Management Committee resolved on the 8th of this month to change the time limit for the delivery of national rice to three days, which should be recognized and supplemented. Regardless of national rice (including Ke Xian rice) or foreign rice, all deliveries must be completed within three days after the transaction. Those who violate it shall be severely punished. The above two items have been resolved and recorded for public announcement. It is hoped that everyone will comply with it. This is of utmost importance. This is hereby announced. The first day of December, the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China."

### Rice Market Tends to Stabilize Following Price Limit

A reporter from Dazhong News Agency inspected the Fuzhou Road Qingliange Rice Industry Tea Party Market from 9:00 a.m. yesterday and saw that the rice market transactions were more stable than before. Management Committee members Fu Qiankeng and Cai Shengming came to the market to advise the industry to abide by the resolution of the Bean and Rice Industry Association the day before yesterday (9th). Therefore, rice prices fell to within the price limit set by the Municipal Council. After the market closed at 11:30 a.m., the 56th meeting was held at the public sample office. Cai Shengming, Hu Wenan, Zheng Shengyun, Yin Fuxiang, Zhou Zizhen, Gu Yisheng, Yang Shaoyuan, Fu Qiankeng, Xu Yesun, and others from the Market Management Committee attended. The meeting was chaired by Fu Qiankeng, who reported on the situation of the meeting with Ho Te-kuei of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement the day before yesterday and the situation of attending the meeting of the Bean and Rice Industry Association the day before yesterday. He also said that if the measures publicly resolved by the rice industry groups this time to suppress rice prices still fail to work, then it may be possible to form a public association to manage sales. However, the most practical way is still to ask each member to strongly persuade the industry to abide by the market sales rules and trade. The committee members present also unanimously agreed that the rice industry should consider the overall situation, embrace the spirit of sacrifice, and lower rice prices. If the overall situation is in danger, the rice industry will also perish together. Then, they resolved to recognize the resolution of the Bean and Rice Industry Association the day before yesterday (9th).

### Discussing the Purchase of Foreign Rice to Carry out Price Stabilization

The Bean and Rice Industry Association is currently resolving to send letters to the authorities of the two concessions, the Chamber of Commerce, and Yu Qiaqing, asking them to organize collective orders for foreign rice and carry out price stabilization. According to reports from the Dazhong News Agency, this measure has been supported by the authorities and powerful groups and powerful people. Public group meetings will be convened in the coming days to actively proceed. It is expected that once this method is implemented, judging from the situation of the previous price stabilization where rice prices plummeted, the Shanghai rice market price will soon fall, which is expected.

### Requesting the Authorities to Find Ways to Dredge

The source of domestic rice in various places is repeatedly obstructed by the Japanese, resulting in great difficulties in transporting rice to Shanghai. Rice weevils are taking the opportunity to become active and raise market prices. The entire rice market is evolving into a chaotic situation. All rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains transported by train the day before yesterday are not allowed to be transported to the concession. A public announcement was posted at the North Railway Station, "All rice and grain transported to Shanghai by train or ship in the future must be registered by the owner at North Sichuan Road. After approval, they can be transported to the concession. Otherwise, they will only be allowed to be sold in Hongkou." Now, the same industry association of the Bean and Rice Industry is resolved to send letters to the authorities of the two concessions: (1) Find ways to dredge the source of domestic rice as soon as possible. (2) Convene various public groups to discuss group orders for foreign rice, so as to increase rice reserves. (3) Request negotiations for 50,000 to 100,000 packages of "removal certificates" for Wuhu Xian rice, so that vendors can purchase and transport them. It is reported that the rice industry groups are also petitioning the concession authorities to negotiate with the consular corps of various countries with the Japanese side, allowing rice merchants to transport rice freely and reduce donations and taxes.

### More Than Ten Groups Appeal for Restraint

The First Special District and the Citizens' Federation of this city have already petitioned the authorities to maintain people's food. In addition, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Silver and Money Industry Association, the Lawyers' Association, the Accountants' Association, the Thrift Committee, and the printing industry and other groups have jointly filed a petition with the authorities, requesting that they severely restrain those in this city who manipulate the rice market and attempt to profit, and request that they take effective measures as soon as possible to suppress and stabilize rice prices to maintain people's food.

### The Panic of Fractional Currency is Relieved; One-Yuan Notes are Issued; Fractional Notes to be Approved and Issued Today; Large Batch of Corner Tickets to be Shipped to Shanghai

The four banks of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank are issuing and exchanging new one-yuan notes transported from Hong Kong in addition to issuing two batches of fractional currency notes on the 8th to relieve the panic of the lack of fractional currency notes in Shanghai. At the same time, the City Chamber of Commerce will crack down on hoarding for profit. The Ministry of Finance has been telegraphed to quickly increase the printing of fractional currency notes and transport them to Shanghai for assistance. The details are as follows:

### Separately Review and Approve Fractional Notes

After the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank issued the second batch of fractional currency notes from the 8th, the members of the Silver and Money Industry Association, the banks and the four major companies have been issued for circulation. Various industries and associations of major factories and merchants have been separately reviewed and the number has been approved. They will be issued from today (Sunday). However, those who go to receive them must exchange them with a notice from the Central Shanghai Bank. As for the third batch of fractional currency notes, it has been printed by the American firm Yongning Company. Once printed, it will be connected to the second batch for distribution.

### Resolutely Crack Down on Hoarding for Profit

The panic of fractional currency notes in Shanghai is due to the inflow of currency into the occupied areas, but it is inevitable that there is manipulation by hoarders, using premiums to make profits, and other forces trying to affect the credit of legal tender. In addition to issuing fractional currency notes to remedy the situation, the Central Bank has also sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce to crack down on hoarding for profit. It is reported that the City Chamber of Commerce has transferred the letter to the money exchange and tobacco exchange industries, ordering members, money changers, and tobacco shops to pay attention and not to hoard in order to avoid affecting change. If the above-mentioned situation is found, it will be severely punished.

### Corner Tickets Will Be Loaded on Foreign Ships and Shipped to Shanghai

After the Central Bank has issued and exchanged as much of the new and old one-yuan notes in its inventory as possible, HSBC has also transported a large number of new one-yuan notes from Hong Kong for exchange, so the panic of the lack of one-yuan notes has been eliminated. In the past, small money shops sold one-yuan notes, charging a premium of 18 yuan per thousand yuan. Now it has been reduced to 5 or 6 yuan. Regarding the fractional currency notes issue, since the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed to increase printing and transport them to Shanghai for adjustment, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the banking community that a large batch of new one-corner and two-corner fractional currency notes will be loaded on foreign ships by foreign banks and transported from Hong Kong to Shanghai for assistance.

### Wartime Losses in the Silver and Money Industry to be Investigated and Reported by Order of the Ministry

The Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance to thoroughly investigate the losses suffered by various banks and money shops during the Anti-Japanese War, with an attached copy of the investigation method, containing more than ten articles, and a deadline for collection and reporting for verification. It is reported that the two industry associations have issued notices to members, banks and money shops to comply.

### Shanghai Circles Yesterday Held a Meeting to Commemorate Wu Guangxin; Over 300 People Attended, with Yu Qiaqing as the Presiding Officiant; Chairman Lin and President Chiang Both Provided Elegies

Following the passing of Wu Guangxin, a senior advisor of the Military Council of the National Government, on the 15th of last month in Hong Kong, his coffin was transported by the Wu family to Shanghai. Yu Qiaqing and others from various circles in Shanghai initiated a memorial service for Mr. Wu, which was held yesterday at 11 a.m. in the grand hall of the Couber Apartments in the French Concession. More than 300 people attended, and the ceremony was extremely solemn. The details are as follows:

Brief Biography of the Late General Wu

Wu's given name was Zitang, courtesy name Guangxin. He graduated from the third class of the Artillery Department of the Japanese Army Military Academy. After returning to China, he entered the Army University and assisted Duan Qirui in planning military and political affairs. Wu participated in the oath-taking ceremony at Machang and the re-establishment of the Republic, as well as advocating for participation in World War I. In the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915), when Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, Wu resigned from his position as division commander in protest. In the fifth year of the Republic (1916), he stationed troops in Yuezhou and was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of Yuezhou. In the sixth year of the Republic (1917), when Sichuan Province was unsettled, he was dispatched as the Commander-in-Chief of the Upper Yangtze River and concurrently the Investigating Commissioner of Sichuan. In the thirteenth year, he served as the Minister of the Army. After the successful completion of the Northern Expedition, Wu followed Duan Qirui south and later served as a senior advisor of the Military Council of the National Government. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in the year before last, Wu moved to Hong Kong. He passed away at his residence in Hong Kong on November 15th of this year.

Strict Security, Momentary Grandeur

Yesterday, the Couber Apartments, where the memorial service was held, was adorned with a tall, colorful archway with a white cloth banner that read "Memorial Service for Army General Wu." The entrance to the hall was also decorated with a colorful archway. In the center of the altar hung a portrait of the late General Wu, along with a floral shrine made of fresh flowers. The table was adorned with fresh fruits and pastries. Dozens of floral wreaths presented by various circles were displayed on the stage, along with plain-colored embroidered satin curtains. The hall was filled with elegiac couplets, creating a simple and solemn atmosphere. Wu's eldest son, Bi Chang, second son, Bi Fa, third son, Bi Kang, and other family members all attended the service in mourning attire. From 8 a.m. onwards, people from all walks of life came to pay their respects in an endless stream. The venue was equipped with both Chinese and Western music bands. The French police dispatched detectives to maintain strict security around the apartments. Yesterday, the entrance to the apartments was filled with plain cars and white horses, a sight of great splendor for a moment.

Eulogy of Yesterday's Memorial Service

On December 10th of the 28th year of the Republic of China, your humble brothers Yu Hede, Xu Guoan, and Xu Yuan, with incense, flowers, and delicacies, offer this sacrifice to the spirit of Army General Wu Zitang: Alas, our lord, a pillar of the nation, who commanded wind and cloud, and had military strategies across the land. He was a national treasure, a star spirit incarnate, who came from Mangdang Mountain. From Jielin Hongyi, he gained fame and reputation. First he knew the poetry and rites, and the school was like a crane standing. He threw away the pen and went overseas, studied jade in order to polish the rough, and learned about military tactics. He returned to assist the military government, and received honorary positions. In the borders of Song and Xing, he soothed the people. He was a general for the army, and he was based on the upper reaches of the river. In the turmoil of Sichuan and Hunan, he built a marquis in harmony with the times. His flags and banners fluttered with brilliance, his jade tent was full of strategies. In the first battle of Yangshu, he wore light fur clothes with a loose belt. Lord Yu admired the moon and roared, and the civil and military people admired him, and showed the demeanor of a Confucius general. He summarized the military hub, and his sharp edges became more prominent. The old assistant generals and lieutenant generals were mostly in their respective defense regions. Thanking the masses, Duke Jin showed the frost on his temples. As times changed, he still tried to repay his loyalty. A great catastrophe came, and the swallow clouds opened up the troubles. The people are suffering and they are heartbroken. He concealed his figure in southern Xinjiang, and had many trials and tribulations. He protects the country with heroic spirit, and he shows the world his noble integrity. His type can be used, and the whole country mourns together. He rides in a spiritual carriage to the sea, and comes to Songmei. A cry at the coffin and a callback to the friendship. Now that the ceremony is over, may the cloud flag stay for a long time. May you enjoy this sacrifice,

### Sending New Year's Cards to Europe - Another Shortcut; Cards Can Reach England and France by the New Year

With the European war raging and the fires of battle spreading everywhere, foreign nationals in Shanghai are deeply concerned about national affairs. Although the number of New Year's cards and similar New Year's calendars and Christmas gifts may be less than in previous years, the number sent through the post office is still quite congested. If you want to send a New Year's card from Shanghai to England and France, whether via the Suez Canal or via the Pacific Ocean, it must arrive by January 10th of next year. In fact, it is impossible to arrive before the end of this year, but if it is delivered to the Siberian route (Via Siberia) before the 14th of this month, it can still arrive in Paris and London before the New Year. If the letter is marked "Via Siberia," the post office will hand it over to the train and seal it directly to Tianjin. In terms of the journey, it can arrive in two days and catch up with the mail sealed and sent in Tianjin on the 17th of this month (Sunday). The arrival time in Moscow is December 27th, the arrival time in London is January 3rd, 1940, and the arrival time in Paris is January 5th, 1940. If the letter is submitted today or tomorrow and marked "Via Siberia," it is expected to catch up with the mail packet sealed in Tianjin on the 14th of this month. The arrival time in Moscow is the 24th of this month, the arrival time in London is the end of this year, and the arrival time in Paris is also November 2nd of next year. Compared with sending by airmail, it seems to be more economical. If sent by airmail, the last batch of delivery time at the Hong Kong Post Office is the 21st. The Royal New Aircraft (i.e., I.A.L.) can fly out of Hong Kong on the 27th and arrive in London and Paris on January 3rd of next year. If handed over to the Sino-French Airlines (i.e., .AF. route) or the Sino-American Airlines of the United American Airlines (i.e., P.A.A. route), they can also arrive in London and Paris on January 6th of next year. If sent to San Francisco in the United States or Sydney, it will be even faster, about three days earlier than London and Paris. However, since the opening of Sino-Japanese air traffic, mail to the United States is often sent via this route. The post office seals and sends airmail rates every month (加納航空資費,郵局每月二十點封發). Sending from Shanghai to Japan by airmail, and then connecting to a ship sailing from Yokohama, is even faster.

### American Merchant Ship "Da Xin" Sinks After Hitting a Reef

The American merchant ship "Da Xin," represented by the Lianchang Foreign Firm in this city, successfully test-sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou at the end of last month. On the morning of the 4th of this month, it loaded cargo and left Ou for Shanghai. Unexpectedly, when it sailed to the waters outside the mouth of the Oujiang River, it suddenly hit a reef. The rear compartment was breached, seawater poured in, and the ship sank. The company initially received no detailed report of the incident, but it was fully confirmed until yesterday. The ship was owned by American merchants and was a small sea vessel with a displacement of only over 500 tons. This time, it was returning to Shanghai from Wenzhou with a large amount of cargo. At about 10 a.m. on the 4th, after sailing out of the mouth of the Oujiang River, it unexpectedly encountered wind in the waters about five li away from Huanghuaguan. Because the ship's tonnage was too small to withstand the waves, it lost control and mistakenly hit a hidden reef. The bottom of the rear compartment was broken, and seawater poured in, causing the ship to gradually sink. The American captain immediately sounded the siren for help. Fortunately, it was during the day, and there were many sailboats passing by, so they gathered to rescue. All the crew members were spared and took the sailing boats to Wenzhou, and then waited for the ship to return. Also, when the ship had an accident, because there was no wireless equipment on board, the company did not receive a formal telegram until yesterday. The company did not know the details of the accident until yesterday, when they received a detailed telegram confirming that the ship had completely sunk, with only the chimney deck still visible above the water. The hull had marine insurance.

### The Iron Gate of Xin Kai River is Rumored to Open Today

The iron gates connecting the French Concession and the Min Guo Road French Concession, including the Xin Bei Men, Lao Bei Men, Xiao Bei Men, and Xin Kai He gates, were closed by the French Concession authorities after the Shanghai war to prevent unexpected events. Those entering and exiting the Nanshi and the concession must have a pass issued by the French Concession authorities, otherwise they must detour through Pudong. According to a New Sound Agency reporter, the French Concession authorities, in consideration of the plight of civilians, will tentatively open the iron gate at Xin Kai River from today. Those passing through this point do not need a concession permit; those entering Nanshi only need to hold a "resident certificate." It is reported that the French Concession authorities will tentatively open it for five days and consider the attitude of the concession authorities after that, depending on the situation after the opening, and whether to continue to open it. However, this news could not be verified by this newspaper's reporter last night after various inquiries.

### Suggesting that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Unite to Control Prices; Please Unite with the Two Concession Authorities and the Court to Organize a Committee to Suppress Hoarding and Speculation

The soaring prices in Shanghai have affected the livelihood of the people. Recently, someone suggested that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce unite with various agencies to organize a committee to find ways to suppress prices and stabilize the market. The suggestion letter stated that the recent surge in rice prices in the city, whose high prices have broken previous records, has made life difficult for civilians. If no measures are taken to suppress prices as soon as possible, rice prices will continue to rise and the consequences will be endless. It is heard that Hong Kong, Tianjin, and other places have implemented price controls. For the sake of the public in this city and for the sake of social stability, it is requested that your association immediately unite with the工部局, the French Municipal Council, and the First and Second Special District Courts to organize a committee to implement price controls in the city, investigate whether there is hoarding and speculation in various industries, and formulate penalties for those who manipulate speculation and raise prices, in order to suppress market prices and stabilize the market. If this can be implemented, it will be the good fortune of all the citizens of Shanghai.

### Winter Stroll - Sketches of French Park -

— Frost Gentleman

On Saturday afternoon, Zhong'er of fourth grade in elementary school and Min'er of the kindergarten didn't have class. After the meal, I negotiated with Xia to go to the theater, but without any results because I was extremely annoyed by the huge expenditure on rice today. - Rice, the top-quality常帮costs forty-six yuan per stone, the second-quality常帮costs forty-two yuan; rice merchants smiled happily, but the common people couldn't swallow. - "Let's go, it's been two or three weeks since we went to the park." Then, I asked the maid to trick the youngest Lin'er out, carried Zhong'er and Min'er with me, and walked towards the entrance of the French Park with rice's annoyance still heavy in my heart.

The entrance to the park was unexpectedly quiet. The children who usually exchanged nickel coins for temporary tickets to facilitate tourists without "passes" were also gone. The weather was cold and tourists were scarce, so their "business" could not be done. A nickel coin could earn three cents of premium, which was a very good business, but now they have lost the opportunity to speculate, and tourists feel inconvenienced. I asked the guard how to buy a ticket without nickel coins, and he said that I could exchange them at the ticket office at the intersection of Hua Long Road. So I had to go around to the entrance of Hua Long Road again.

"Hey! Do you want nickel coins?" A haggard middle-aged man, playing with the sound of many nickel coins in his hand, asked me.

"How many points of premium do you want?" I asked.

"Three cents for one dime," he offered the exchange rate.

"Two cents, is that okay?" I only had tungsten coins from the tram that cost two cents each in my pocket. I asked him if he could reduce the premium by one cent.

"No, my cost is still two cents."

I didn't want to be entangled with him any longer, and walked towards the park entrance. By the way, I bought three bags of spiced beans for one dime of paper money and received four cents in change. The nickel coin exchanger saw that I had change, and he ran up to negotiate the deal again, but I ignored him. I walked to the ticket booth at the entrance of the park, put in a one-dime bill, exchanged it for a one-dime nickel coin without discount, put it into the ticket machine that looked like a slot machine, got the ticket, and led the two children victoriously into the French Park.

Just inside the park entrance, I saw a little girl of four or five years old crying next to the guard, saying that her mother was lost. This reminded me of the large number of orphans recently taken in by the 工部局's Children's Protection Section and the Orphanage, and I couldn't help but feel sad.

A month ago, during the season of "autumn skies, fat crabs, holding crabs and enjoying chrysanthemums," the French Park was unusually lush, with paulownia trees spreading their magnificent branches and chrysanthemums blooming, attracting people to stroll and admire. You held your lover's hand, strolling in the paulownia-lined avenues, the scorching sun secretly smiled and blessed you from the dense green leaves; walking, walking, leisurely walking, strolling to the lawn, walking into the flowerbeds; at that time, your hearts were filled with "unspoken beauty," and you felt the greatness of life! But now these scenes are gone. The love of youth is only a fleeting moment. The ruthless frost has deprived the flowers and trees of their abundant life. Youth is fleeting, and the leaves are falling. Now only dry branches remain.

There were fewer tourists, but it hasn't been that cold in the past few days. It should be said that it was a warm winter day, with the wind gently kissing your face and the sun gently caressing you, and red clouds flying on your cheeks as if you were drunk. Children were playing on the lawn, and their innocent childishness made them forget the suffering of sitting on hard benches for a week. Around the simple fountain, leisurely men and women sat, some reading and some whispering to each other.

"This water keeps spraying out, how come the water in the pond doesn't overflow?" Zhong'er pointed to the spray in the pond and asked curiously.

We walked to the big pond and sat down. Looking at the sunny side opposite, the leaves of a paulownia tree had not yet completely fallen, and the sun reflected a dazzling light on the sparse leaves. Under the tree-lined avenue, people's shadows flickered in the distance, and occasionally one or two young women strolled across the small bridge opposite. I asked Zhong'er intentionally or unintentionally if he had a pencil, and he said no. But even if he had a pencil, what could I do? I deeply regretted not being able to learn how to draw! I really wanted to depict this scene at that time.

So I walked to the paulownia tree opposite and sat down on the semicircular embankment. There were exactly three empty chairs, and we each occupied one. Facing the sun, I closed my eyes and listened quietly to the rustling of the leaves. The wind was gentle and the sun was shining brightly, it was truly intoxicating and sleepy. Golden carp in the pond, about four or five inches long, swam back and forth, looking for food on the surface of the water. Min'er chewed the beans into pieces and spat them into the water. After a while, a layer of golden yellow floated on the bottom of the water, and hundreds of goldfish swam leisurely to snatch the bean crumbs, sucking up with their pointed mouths, and then quickly sinking down with their tails wagging. I curiously rolled up my sleeves and waited by the pond, and when the fish came to snatch the food, I quickly reached out to catch them. For a while, I caught a fish's head, but it still broke free. I suddenly discovered many small shrimps in the gaps along the stone bank, and Zhong'er also took off his coat and reached out to catch them. In the end, they caught nine of them, jumping non-stop in their hands, and finally they put them back into the water.

Occasionally, a breeze came and ruffled the pond water with many wrinkles. The sun gradually set, and the desolate park was covered with a layer of glorious golden light. We said goodbye to the fish and walked towards the zoo with interest.

"Hey, when are we going to the Shanghai West Club? It's so much fun there."

I heard someone talking behind me, and it turned out to be two young men in suits. I doubted the greatness of the magic power of the Shanghai West Club and the like.

We bought tickets again and walked into the zoo. I was already tired of these animals, but Min'er always wanted to see the dozens of monkeys every time she came. In fact, there were indeed the most people watching the monkeys, and unlike those who glanced at the lions, tigers, and birds and left, many people often surrounded them, teasing them, and throwing food to them. This may be because monkeys are the ancestors of mankind and have some human nature, just as humans still have some monkey nature. For example, if you throw in a peanut or other food, the monkeys will chase and snatch it, but the result is often that the most ferocious and largest monkey snatches it away. The little monkeys quickly run away after hearing the roar of the big monkey. But out of pity for the little monkeys, people often throw food to the little monkeys when the big monkey is not paying attention. The children clapped their hands and cheered, forgetting to return. But monkeys are after all natural savages and kill each other. Isn't the whole world of mankind the same as monkeys!

### Over Two Thousand Unemployed Chinese Laborers from Foreign Ships Arrive in Shanghai in Batches to Transfer Back to Their Hometowns

According to the Shanghai Seamen's Office, since the outbreak of the European War, submarines have appeared and attacked航輪 from various countries, which is very active, resulting in ships from the various nations suspending voyages or shortening their routes. As for Britain, it has modified and armed a thousand of its merchant ships. Therefore, many of its workers and engineers have been discharged and dismissed. Consequently, the number of unemployed Chinese ship laborers returning to their country has reached over 2,100. These unemployed Chinese ship laborers originally served on merchant ships from countries such as Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Holland, Norway, and Greece, working as sailors, stokers, painters, carpenters, etc., for periods ranging from a dozen years. Now, due to the outbreak of the European War, they have been successively discharged and returned to their country. They are now transferring to Shanghai in batches to return to their hometowns such as Wenzhou, Qingtian, Rui'an, Ningbo Zhoushan, etc. They will have to wait for the end of the European war before being summoned by foremen to continue serving in their original shipping companies.

### American Warship "Quillfish" Returns to Shanghai; Will First Study the Contents of the Case of Japanese Military Police Assaulting American Sailors Before Conducting Negotiations

At 10:30 a.m. on the 6th, a plainclothes officer from the Japanese Military Police intruded onto an American naval boat anchored at the No. 4 pontoon on the Bund, interfered with the military supplies on the boat, and even assaulted Mr. Russell, an officer from the American Naval Purchasing Office. After this incident occurred, the director of the purchasing office, Lieutenant Colonel Chuan Shu, reported the details to Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the American Yangtze River Patrol. The admiral, who was on a mission to Wuhu, attached great importance to the report. According to the Japanese naval spokesman's statement on the evening of the 8th, the case had been resolved due to the visit of a Japanese officer's American representative. However, according to information obtained by reporters, the Japanese spokesman's remarks were only a one-sided view. The American Consulate could not verify the Japanese side's statement. It is now learned that Rear Admiral Glassford urgently returned to Shanghai from Wuhu yesterday. The American warship "Luzon" also came. It is believed that the assault on American naval personnel is a matter for the naval side, and the American Consulate is not prepared to intervene. This matter will be studied by Rear Admiral Glassford before negotiations are initiated. A scene of international dispute will be given new development due to Rear Admiral's arrival in Shanghai.

The mainland press reports that, within the compound of the Japanese Telephone and Telegraph Company on Gongxing Road, Zhabei, one hundred and fifty telephone poles treated with preservative oil caught fire yesterday (the 9th) due to carelessness. The resulting thick smoke engulfed the northeastern part of Shanghai for two hours. The Hongkou Fire Brigade, alerted at 1:45 PM, rushed to the scene.

### Wheelock & Co. Sues China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for Large Sum in Ship Price Dispute, Alleging Failure to Deliver Sold Vessel; Defendant Denies Existence of Concluded Sales Contract, Refuses to Pay Compensation; Court Orders Investigation and Further Hearing

Ye Chuanfang, manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at No. 2, the Bund, French Concession, was recently sued in the Second Special Court's civil division by Madden, manager of the British firm Wheelock & Co., represented by lawyers Xu Shihao and Rong Zhenlong. The suit requests a ruling ordering the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to deliver the steamship "Iden" according to law, with the plaintiff paying the defendant the ship's price of:

£20,000 British Gold.

The defendant is also to pay the plaintiff compensation for losses at a rate of £1,360 per month from October 11th of this year until the date of actual delivery. If the defendant cannot deliver the ship, in addition to compensating for the aforementioned losses, they must also compensate the plaintiff an additional £10,000. According to the complaint, the court held a hearing yesterday in Civil Court No. 7, presided over by Judge Yu Changzi. The defendant, Ye Chuanfang, accompanied by his attorney Jiang Yiping, appeared in court. First, attorney Xu Shihao, representing the plaintiff Wheelock & Co., stated the plaintiff's intentions, saying that the defendant, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, sent a letter to the plaintiff on October 4th of this year, offering to sell the:

Steamship "Iden"

for £20,000 British Gold. The time for the contract was set for noon on October 7th. At that time, Ye Chuanfang, the legal representative of the defendant China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, went to the Wheelock & Co. office. Madden, the legal representative of the plaintiff Wheelock & Co., immediately agreed and signed the original letter from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, declaring acceptance. Ye also signed to confirm, believing that the sales contract had been completed in accordance with Article 345 of the Civil Code. As for the method of delivery of the ship, both parties agreed that it would depend on the condition of the ship's repairs. Madden immediately ordered his female secretary, Goldenberg, to write a letter:

Given to Ye Chuanfang

Stating that the terms of the sale were that the buyer had the option to choose whether the ship would be delivered after repairs or in its current condition, and that this choice had to be declared before signing the contract. Two days later, the defendant responded, stating that the cost of repairing the ship in Hong Kong was more than HK$111,300. The plaintiff then declared that they would accept delivery in its current condition and attached a draft contract for signing. Unexpectedly, the defendant suddenly denied that the plaintiff had made a commitment and said that the sale of the ship had not been confirmed, and also claimed that the ship was not owned by the defendant. In fact, the ship was purchased with a loan from the plaintiff to the defendant. Subsequently, attorney Jiang Yiping, representing the defendant, argued that based on the correspondence presented by the plaintiff, the sales contract between the two parties:

Was never established

The "Iden" steamship is owned by China Merchants Steamship Co. and the defendant only introduced the sale. According to the law, the sale has not been established, and the plaintiff is demanding that the defendant compensate for losses of more than £10,000, equivalent to 700,000 or 800,000 yuan in national currency. The defendant has no such obligation and requests that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. Next, female secretary Goldenberg and Song Wenkui testified about the writing and signing of the letter. Afterwards, according to the defendant Ye Chuanfang's testimony, it was true that he borrowed money from the plaintiff to buy the ship, but the important documents he exchanged with the plaintiff did not state words such as "verified". The court, upon reviewing the testimony, deemed it necessary to investigate further and adjourned the hearing to a later date.

### Son Commits Suicide Due to Financial Difficulties; Bank Sues His Father, Who Claims He Has No Obligation to Inherit Debts

Li Zhufeng, an old man from Zhenjiang residing at No. 11, Caihe Lane, Tiantong Road, is sixty-four years old this year. His son, Li Xieqing, previously opened the Tongmao Electrical Supplies Store and the Tongtai Customs Brokerage on Guangdong Road. Later, due to business failure and financial difficulties, he suddenly committed suicide by taking poison at the China Hotel on Guizhou Road in mid-July of this year, and could not be saved. His widow, through lawyer Xiong Fei, applied to the First Special Court's civil division for limited inheritance rights, which was approved. Recently, however, the Huizhong Bank, claiming that Li Xieqing still had outstanding debts, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court's civil division against his father, Li Zhufeng, to recover the debts. The case was heard yesterday in Civil Court No. 3 by Judge Ni Wei'ou. The plaintiff's lawyer presented the case, and the defendant also appeared with his lawyer, Shen Hanzhang. They stated that since the debt was owed by the defendant's son, his father had no obligation to inherit it and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The court, upon reviewing the testimony, adjourned the hearing to the 16th of this month.

### Yuanhe Restaurant Bloodshed Case Details Clear; Gangsters Seek Revenge; Four Suspects Tried and Awaiting Sentencing

Lu Tinghe, a Wuxi native and employee of the Yuanhe Restaurant at No. 292, Shanxi Road, was seriously injured in an altercation on the afternoon of the 21st of last month at 7:00 PM. He hired a rickshaw to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he was already on the verge of death at the Beijing Road intersection.

Died Shortly After

Recently, detectives Wang Jinsheng, Han Shoushan, and Jin Deshun from the General Police Department apprehended four suspects: Xu Shujin, Sun Changbiao, Zhang Maotong, and Dong Changyou, all natives of Siyang and employees of the sesame cake shop at No. 288, Shanxi Road. They were handed over to the First Special District Court, and the police charged them with the crime of causing death by injury under the criminal code. The presiding judge, Jiang Shuzi, specially opened Criminal Court No. 3 yesterday morning to hear the case. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that the case was complex. Initially, according to:

Yuanhe Restaurant

Owner Yu Shougen, on the afternoon of the 19th of this month at 7:00 PM, six diners with northern accents came to eat, and the bill totaled one yuan and fifty cents. Before leaving, they only paid one yuan and left. The next evening, they came again to eat, causing an argument, and they fled in a crowd. On the 20th, they invited more than ten people to the restaurant to cause trouble, resulting in Lu Tinghe being injured and dying. In fact, the case was originally caused by the sesame cake shop opened by the defendant Xu Shujin, whose back door faced the restaurant. In the past, they had disagreements over tap water:

They often had disagreements

Later, Bai Qiyuan, a native of Siyang who was at large, set up a sweet potato stall at the entrance of the sesame cake shop, accusing an apprentice at Yuanhe Restaurant of stealing sweet potatoes from his stall. The restaurant owner was notified, but he lost face and invited a strong Wuxi native to question and beat Bai Qiyuan. Bai was unwilling to submit and invited Lao Kai, a fellow native of Siyang, Xu Xiaoshitou, the nephew of the defendant Xu Shujin, and Hemp Face, a fellow native who had a sesame cake stall on Hankou Road, as well as the fourth defendant, Dong Changyou. That evening they went to Yuanhe Restaurant to:

Seek revenge

Resulting in Lu Tinghe being fatally wounded with a knife. However, it was alleged that the defendants Xu Shujin, Zhang Maotong, and Sun Changbiao were also at the scene of the crime. After Yu Shougen, the owner of Yuanhe Restaurant, testified, he stated that the four defendants had all helped to commit the crime. The defendants Xu Shujin, Sun Changbiao, Zhang Maotong, and Dong Changyou all denied participating in the incident. They hired Zheng Wenkai as their lawyer to defend them. The court ruled that the four defendants would remain in custody pending sentencing.

### Head of Newspaper Vendors Killed; Main Offender Sentenced to Fifteen Years in Prison

Wu Guisheng, the head of the newspaper vendors, had a feud with fellow vendor Li Changyu (nickname "Little Hubei") over soliciting a female prostitute. Li then harbored a malicious intent and lured Wu into Lane 604, Fuzhou Road, on March 21st of this year with several accomplices. They used sharp blades to slash Wu more than ten times, resulting in his murder. Afterwards, the police captured four accomplices, including Xu Asi, and they were sentenced by the First Special Court to varying degrees of punishment. Li was at large, but was recently captured by detective Chen Ruisheng of the Lao Zha Police Station. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a lawsuit against him in the First Special Court according to law. The case has now been concluded. The presiding judge, Xiao Xiefen, opened court the day before yesterday to pronounce the judgment: Li Changyu was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for joint murder and deprived of his civil rights for ten years.

### Chinese Constable Murders Mistress; Sentenced to Ten Years in Prison

Wu Yuguang (28 years old), a constable with the General Police Department with badge number 2478 and a native of Shandong, had an affair with Zhang Yueying (20 years old), a woman from Nanjing. Zhang had repeatedly asked Wu to rent a house and live with her, but Wu refused because of his weak financial situation, leading to disputes. On the evening of July 12th of this year, Wu and Zhang went to Room 10 of the Tongli Public Hostel at No. 6, Lane 195, Fujian Road, for an intimate rendezvous. The next morning, Wu suddenly jumped out of the window and injured his back. The tea boy then discovered that Zhang Yueying had been murdered in the room, with multiple stab wounds on her body and a necktie around her neck. He reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station, and detective Guo Ruiquan rushed to the scene and arrested Wu. Because Wu was also injured, he was sent to the hospital for treatment.

However, when passing Haig Road in western Shanghai, Wang Fugen, a local gangster from Ningbo, stopped Zhu and forcibly demanded a protection fee of five yuan per head of cattle, totaling eighty-five yuan. Zhu had no choice but to pay sixty yuan before he was allowed to pass. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, when Zhu was drinking tea at the teahouse at No. 67, Haig Road, Wang gathered a crowd to demand the remaining twenty-five yuan. Zhu reported it to the police station, who sent detective Wu Wenxiang to arrest Wang. He was brought to Criminal Court No. 2 of the First Special Court yesterday morning. After Judge Xiao inquired, Wang Fugen was sentenced to eight months in prison.

Zhang Wangshi: Zhang Shaoqing, a native of Nanjing, fifty-two years old, who worked on ships, came to the Zhu Shunxing Inn at No. 379, Dongmulaikou Street, Rue Adoard in the French Concession, on the 12th of last month with his wife, Wangshi (fifty-one years old), and their two children (eleven years old). They rented Room 5. On the midnight of the 8th of this month, Zhang took his children and left without saying goodbye, abandoning Wangshi at the inn. Wangshi woke up and, feeling abandoned, had a moment of despair and committed suicide by hanging herself with a belt on the bed frame in the room. At 10:00 AM on the 9th, the tea boy discovered her and reported it to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate. Although she was already dead, her body was still warm, so an ambulance was called to take her to Guangci Hospital. She ultimately died despite efforts to save her.

Xu Ren: Xu Ren, a local girl residing at No. 16, across from the Great World on Route Nimeteigne, French Concession, fifteen years old this year, was scolded by her mother, Xu Ding (thirty years old), on the 9th because of something, leading to a conflict.

### Marital Knowledge: Secrets to Eternal Love Between Husband and Wife

To be frank, marriage is the union of sexual relationships. When a young man marries a young woman, after the wedding ceremony, unless there are hidden illnesses or other reasons, they will consummate their relationship. Considering the nature of women, their ideal for their lifelong partner must be very high during their virginity. Sometimes, they even dream of a strong, vigorous, and promising man wooing and loving them, and how happy and glorious they are. If she marries a weak, incompetent, and unambitious husband, she will inevitably feel disappointed. If the sexual life that is essential in a marriage cannot be fulfilling, or if the husband has a hidden illness and cannot consummate the marriage, then the marriage relationship will be impossible to maintain, and where can love be found? Thus, all kinds of family tragedies are played out! Why are men weak and incompetent, with hidden illnesses? According to new medical theories, the most common causes are early indulgence in masturbation, untreated nocturnal emissions, early marriage and excessive sex, or unrestrained licentiousness, or worries and overwork, which damage the endocrine function of the reproductive glands. As a result, symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, kidney deficiency, infertility, weak brain, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, and neurasthenia are endless. Such men are not only difficult to be husbands and fall into miserable situations in life, but also will achieve nothing in their studies and careers, with a bleak and hopeless future, or even premature aging and early death! How critical is this!

If you want a husband and wife to be eternally loving and have a great future in your career, then abundant energy and guaranteed health are the only secrets. If a man is unfortunately suffering from the above symptoms due to early romantic encounters, he should seek thorough treatment as soon as possible. Do not delay, lest you make mistake after mistake. According to the case studies of world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, taking the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal" is the most effective treatment for the symptoms. This preparation is made from the essence of the reproductive gland endocrine extracted from the bodies of strong animals, using an academic replication method, and the ingredients are completely preserved. Therefore, the quality is precious and the efficacy is certain, which is unmatched by any similar preparation. Taking this preparation will generate sperm and nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate the blood in one day and night. Continued use will further regulate metabolism, promote development, and nourish the nerves. In a short period of time, all symptoms will be cured. Regular use in winter and spring will prolong life, rejuvenate and return to youth. Only those with spermatorrhea need to take the world-renowned anti-spermatorrhea medicine "Himit's Sperm Firming Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage for even faster results!

Patient Gu Fuxiang, from Zhejiang, 25 years old, suffered from kidney deficiency, infertility, premature ejaculation, impotence, and nocturnal emission due to early marriage and excessive sex. At first, the relationship between husband and wife was still strong, but now it is gradually fading, and his wife has repeatedly expressed her intention to divorce. In order to fundamentally cure his illness, Mr. Gu went to the clinic for treatment. After examining his actual condition, he was instructed to purchase three dozen "Germinal" and two dozen "Himit's Sperm Firming Tablets" at the China and Western Pharmacy, and take them together. He also received new therapies such as electrotherapy and injections. In just two months, all his illnesses were cured, and he was happy and healthy. It is also said that his wife has had a dream of bearing a child.

### Beauty: The Most Ideal Remedy for Withered and Sunken Breasts

— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor

All women have two major aspirations: one is to be as beautiful as a fresh flower in bud during their virginity, fragrant and sweet everywhere, and to be praised, "This girl is so beautiful," and as a result, marry a good husband. The other is that after marriage, they hope that the husband's temperament is as soft, fragrant, and gentle as spearmint gum, and that both sides have a deep affection for each other, and have several little angels jumping around them, living their happy days.

Such aspirations are certainly not excessive delusions, but to truly achieve such happiness, according to research by French gynecologist Dr. Vigny and Dr. Luxing, president of the American Baxter Hospital, the first thing is to ensure that the body is fully developed, and especially to ensure that the breasts are high and erect. Because breasts that can be high and elastic can not only form the most mysterious and lovely curves with the hips, making people intoxicated and admiring, but also because of the healthy function of the ovaries and the vigorous metabolism, the temperament is always gentle and supple, the muscles are plump, and the complexion is rosy and charming. If you can be so beautiful, there will naturally be many suitors, and choosing a good husband will not be a problem. Not only that, but from a reproductive point of view, these women, because of their healthy bodies, accurate menstruation, and gentle personalities, will give birth to lively, clever, and lovely children. On the other hand, those whose breasts are withered and sunken, whose hips are thin, and who have lost their beauty, not only suffer from many diseases and pains, and have no happy and healthy days, but also, in terms of appearance, are despised by men of the times, so that spring flowers and autumn moons, empty boudoirs and sighs, long nights and tear-soaked pillows! The bitterness in this is simply unspeakable to outsiders. However, in this era of scientific omnipotence, why don't smart ladies quickly use the animal ovarian preparation "Germinal" for women to save themselves? This preparation has special effects for treating breast atrophy, facial aging, and all women's hidden illnesses. After taking it, it can cultivate and nourish the ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus and stop leucorrhea in one day and night. If you continue to take it for a whole winter, even white hair can turn black and old age can return to youth. The development of breasts is a sure thing.

### Untreated Nocturnal Emission Will Harm Yourself and Others

— Zhan Nianhui, Venereal Disease Specialist

The health of children is the result of parents' inheritance and education, while the health of young people and adults is the result of their self-care. Young people in the period of spring love, if they do not know how to take care of themselves, and commit bad habits such as masturbation, homosexual anal sex, and early marriage and excessive sex, which damage the sex nerves and loosen the sperm gate, then terrible nocturnal emission will follow. Once nocturnal emission occurs, the source of our life will be lost and cannot be stored. This is even more dangerous in this cold winter! "If you don't store sperm in winter, you will get sick in spring." This is common sense that everyone knows. If you think that nocturnal emission is painless and symptomless, and delay treatment, then brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, disturbing dreams, back pain, kidney deficiency, infertility, premature ejaculation, impotence, and incomplete development will follow. Heroes are only afraid of illness, and this kind of young people, even if they have great ambitions, even if they have had a body of bronze tendons and iron bones, will also be depressed and disheartened. In this winter, they will feel cold hands and feet, and tremble from time to time. Colds and coughs are endless. How can students in school be diligent in their studies, so their grades will fall behind, or even drop out of school? Those who are engaged in business and industry will not be able to perform well and may even lose their jobs! If in the field of love between men and women, and in the sexual life of couples, there will be various tragedies such as losing love and losing happiness because of this. In today's society, there are countless such cases!

Young people with nocturnal emission who want to avoid harming themselves and others must seek thorough treatment as soon as possible. According to the case studies of millions of world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, taking the anti-nocturnal emission medicine "Himit's Sperm Firming Tablets" (available at all Wu Zhou Hua Mei Pharmacies for a real price of two yuan per box) is the most effective and rapid. After taking it, it can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, and have the effect of promoting sleep and stopping nocturnal emission that night. If you already have the above symptoms, you must also take the male animal gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal" to generate sperm and nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate the blood, nourish the nerves, and promote development. Continued use will definitely cure all symptoms and improve health in a short period of time. If patients can come to the clinic for new therapies such as electrotherapy and injections, they will be guaranteed to be cured.

### Current University Unified Entrance Examination Overview (1) - Ministry of Education Section Chief Huang Longxian's Overview

(Chongqing Aviation News) Huang Longxian, Section Chief of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, recently wrote an article "Review of the University Unified Entrance Examination," stating the significance of the unified examination, reporting the outline of the method, explaining the process, and reviewing the examination methods, a lengthy piece of several thousand words. The original text is very long, so here is a selected excerpt of the outline of the method (the entire first paragraph "The Significance of the Unified Examination" is followed in its entirety) below:

This year's unified examination is roughly handled according to the precedents of last year. Last year's method is described in detail in the report of the National College Unified Enrollment Committee established by the Ministry of Education in 1938, so there is no need to report it one by one again. This place only explains a few important points and briefly describes the differences between this year's method and last year's method, so that the general public can understand the general situation of the handling.

(1) Organization of the Unified Examination

The organization of the unified examination is divided into two parts: the Ministry of Education establishes a Unified Enrollment Committee, which is responsible for planning and implementing all matters related to unified enrollment. Enrollment zones are established in various places, and enrollment committees are organized to handle enrollment affairs in each zone. Examination sub-offices may also be established when necessary. The powers of the Unified Enrollment Committee are to formulate enrollment regulations, stipulate the standards for question setting, grading, and admission, prepare unified test questions, interpret various enrollment laws and regulations, review examination results, and decide on the admission and allocation of students. The powers of the enrollment committees in each zone are to handle student registration, invigilation, and scoring, invite question-setting committee members to prepare a draft of test questions, review the qualifications and examination results of examinees, create candidate lists and various grade reports, and post the names of students admitted by the Ministry. In this way, we can know that the task undertaken by the enrollment committees in each zone is only to handle registration, examination, invigilation, scoring, create grade reports, and check the admission of students, while the important matters of formulating regulations, preparing test questions, setting standards, and admitting and distributing students are handled by the Unified Enrollment Committee of the Ministry of Education. However, the final decision-making power still rests with the Ministry of Education. In terms of personnel, in addition to separately designating the university president or director of education as the chairman of the committee in each zone, the committee members are all university professors, key officials, or important personnel from educational administrative agencies in the zone. The Unified Enrollment Committee has the director and counselors of the Ministry of Education and the section chief in charge of higher education as ex officio members, and the Ministry hires a number of university presidents and professors as members, designating one person as chairman. The organization of personnel can be said to be quite strict. This year's enrollment zones are divided into fifteen zones: Chongqing, Chengdu, Nanzheng, Kunming, Guiyang, Chenxi, Yanping, Guilin, Lanzhou, Enshi, Taihe, Yongkang, Qujiang, Zhenping, and Shanghai. The enrollment sub-offices set up in various places include thirteen places: Hechuan, Baisha, Leshan, Wugong, Ankang, Hong Kong, Tongren, Suoli, Lantian, Yishan, Changting, Longyan, and Yong'an. The distribution in terms of region can be considered very common.

### Fair Price of Foreign Rice Is Less Than 20 Yuan

— Bao Leti

It is reported that each picul of foreign rice also costs 38 to 39 yuan, the reason being the shrinking foreign exchange and the expensive freight. However, according to the Singapore Daily News, the price of Rangoon rice in July of this year was:

Rangoon Rice Price (Rupee Price Per 7500 Pounds)

The above unit of goods is 7500 pounds, and the currency unit is Rupee. Then, according to 0.9074 to convert to market picul, and according to this month's 9th Indian exchange rate of 100 yuan combined with 23.5 Rupee (that is, each Rupee is equal to 4 yuan, 2 jiao, 6 cents weak), then the selling price per market picul is:

Rangoon Rice Converted to Legal Tender Price Per Picul

The above price is calculated as: RS. ÷ (7500 × 0.9074) × $4, 26

At that time, the new rice had not yet been launched, so the price was more expensive; however, calculated at today's exchange rate, each market picul is only 14 to 15 yuan. With the new rice on the market today, the selling price in Rangoon must be cheaper than before, and there is no reason to rebound. That is to say, no matter how expensive the freight is, it will not reach nearly 40 yuan per picul. As far as we know, the freight from Shanghai to Rangoon before the war was only 11 to 12 yuan per ton, which is only 1 yuan, 1 jiao, 2 cents per picul. If we calculate a total of 5 yuan per picul, the selling price of Rangoon rice in Shanghai will not exceed 20 yuan!

### Analysis of Japan's Financial Strength (Part 1)

— Abstracted and translated by Zhu Shihui

The Sino-Japanese War has lasted for more than two years. Whether Japan's financial strength can continue to maintain a long-term war is a question that we urgently need to answer. This article is an excerpt from "Japan's Financial Capacity for War" published in the September issue of Amerasia. The original author, A. Grajdanzco, objectively analyzes the strength and weakness of Japan's financial capabilities with reliable figures, which is quite worthy of our reference. Now, its general meaning is translated below:

In modern warfare, the abundance of financial resources on both sides of the belligerent countries, or the strength or weakness of their economic capabilities, is undoubtedly a primary factor in achieving victory. In this Sino-Japanese War, comparing the economic situations of the two countries, Japan is obviously in a more advantageous position, because her economic institutions had already been modernized before the war. At the same time, because the battlefield is in China, her many industrial and commercial cities have not been subjected to air raids and occupation, and her overseas trade has not been threatened by blockade like China. Her tax revenue has not been reduced by the war. As for China, its financial position during the war is not the same as before the war, because it has lost several important tax revenues before the war.

If we want to understand all of Japan's financial revenue and expenditure during the war, it is best to compare it with the budget for the fiscal year before the war (April 1, 1936 to March 31, 1937). Some people may say that Japan's budget for the year before the war cannot be regarded as a peacetime budget, because she had already embarked on the road of war preparations in that year. However, if we look at the comparative figures listed below in this article, we can understand that the budget for the 1936-37 fiscal year still has great increases and decreases compared with the budgets for several years during the war. We will now first compare the actual receipts and payments for the 1936-37 fiscal year and the 1937-38 fiscal year with the estimated budget numbers for the 1938-39 fiscal year and the 1939-40 fiscal year. Because this article is aimed at studying Japan's financial strength, it pays special attention to the analysis of the Japanese government's annual revenue, and only lists the various expenses related to the war and their percentage of the annual revenue in terms of its expenditures. The following table is a comparison of the Japanese government's annual revenues and expenditures

The expenditures on the army and navy in the above table include various expenses for conscription, military hospitals, wounded soldiers' recuperation, and military relief, as well as remittances from the military special account. (We do not know whether this fund has been fully used.) From observing the above table, we can discover one point: that is, the annual revenue for the 1939-40 fiscal year has increased fourfold compared to the annual revenue for the 1936-37 fiscal year. The Japanese government's annual revenue can be divided into the following four items: (1) tax revenue, (2) revenue from official industries and official properties, (3) revenue from public bonds and other loans, (4) miscellaneous revenue. If we take the various types of annual revenue for the 1936-37 fiscal year as the base number, we can obtain the growth rates of the various types of annual revenue for the three years thereafter as follows:

The attached wholesale price index and separately sold price index are as follows: (with 1936 as the base year)

From the above table, we can see that the ordinary tax revenue in the 1939-40 fiscal year increased by 6% compared to the 1936-37 fiscal year, the profits from the monopoly bureau increased by 12%, the revenue from official industries and official properties increased by 12%, and the revenue from business profit tax and income tax increased to 335%. Among them, the fastest increase was the government's loan revenue, which increased by 927%. At the same time, we can also see that in the 1939-40 fiscal year, apart from loan revenue and business tax income tax revenue, there was no type of revenue (miscellaneous revenue is an exception, because its nature is a combined number of various other revenues). The extent of its increase can exceed the extent of the increase in prices.

The growth rates of the Japanese government's annual revenues of various types are as mentioned above. Now we further list the amount of each type of revenue and its percentage of the total annual revenue:

### The Current Crisis in Japan's Foreign Trade (Continued)

— Original Author: John Ahlers, Translated from Millard's Review

Japan is already encountering these difficulties, and the trade problems caused by the European war have not been resolved. Outside the yen bloc, Japan's trade with Europe accounts for 15% of its exports and 16% of its imports. A large part of this trade has now been lost. Imports from Germany, which account for half of Japan's total imports from Europe, have been completely cut off for several months. Whether the Soviet Union will place the Trans-Siberian Railway under Japanese-German control for large-scale transit traffic is a completely open question, mostly depending on the concessions Tokyo offers to Moscow as a reward. About six weeks ago, Japan negotiated with the European Allied Powers and obtained a firm guarantee that the Allies would not interfere with the export of industrial equipment from Germany to Japan by sea. However, this guarantee has since been invalidated by the Allies' decision to prevent all exports from Germany. The Allies, and even neutral countries including Italy, are causing Japan anxiety by not fulfilling many of Japan's orders for industrial products. Coupled with shipping difficulties, it is not surprising that Japan's imports decreased sharply in the first three months of the European war, forcing Japan to reduce the scope and extend the time frame of its industrial expansion plans.

Under the impetus of the European war, Japan's export industry is developing irregularly. The value of Japan's exports surged throughout September, reaching an unusual high near the end of September. However, in the first three weeks of October, it plummeted sharply, and then decreased further. Some of Japan's exports, such as those to Germany, have been cut off by the war. However, Germany accounts for only 2.5% of Japan's exports outside the yen bloc. This loss has been temporarily offset by a large increase in Japanese cotton cloth, glass sheets, and other commodities to Asian markets. The price of Japanese raw silk has soared, from 1,300 yen per bale in Yokohama to 2,000 yen, but then fell to 1,850 yen. Raw silk accounts for almost 80% of Japan's total exports to the United States, so the yen value of Japan's exports to the United States has increased significantly.

With imports decreasing and export values rising, Japan's trade balance with countries outside the yen bloc has improved significantly. In the first eight months of this year, the average monthly trade deficit was 60 million yen, while in October there was a surplus of only 2 million yen. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon that cannot be sustained, because (1) the last three months of each year are usually the most favorable period for Japan's trade balance, (2) Japan's imports from the United States will increase significantly in the following months, as large batches of newly placed orders to the United States will be fulfilled, and (3) the boom in exports of cotton cloth and glass sheets must be a flash in the pan. In the past two months, Japan's exports have increased because it shipped out old inventory. The main reason Japan was able to dispose of its inventory was the devaluation of the yen and the readjustment of the price levels of these commodities to suit foreign buyers. While exports of cotton cloth and glass increased, domestic production of these commodities continued to decrease due to increasing shortages of raw materials and electricity. The inventory of cotton cloth and glass will soon be exhausted, at which time these exports will cease.

Japan will again enjoy favorable export prospects due to the European war. This hope has already been realized, but the war in China prevents Japan from profiting from this possibility. In the past few weeks, Japan has received orders and inquiries from (1) San Francisco, Calcutta, Panama, Brazil, West Africa, Egypt, and Bangkok for canned food, dry food, machinery, rayon silk, glass, and porcelain; (2) Mexico for iron pipes, rayon fabrics, paper, and plywood; (3) India for 40,000 tons of bleaching powder; (4) Norway for 5 million burlap sacks. Those who issued these orders and inquiries all wanted to procure Japanese goods, but they had not previously imported these goods from Japan. However, a report from the Central Federation for the Promotion of Foreign Trade in Tokyo, which has this information, sadly states that the current position of Japanese industry has made it impossible to fulfill these orders. All of the foreign exchange funds that Japan can obtain are being set aside to purchase any kind of war material that can be obtained from the United States before January 26 next year. Japan is now unable to purchase foreign raw materials to manufacture more exports. The Tokyo Ministry of Finance continues to reject applications for additional foreign exchange for peacetime industries, and has even ordered further reductions in the foreign exchange allocated to peacetime industries for the import of raw materials.

The recent devaluation of the yen following the pound sterling is also a major problem for Japan's foreign trade. Most of Japan's exports are sold to countries whose currencies have also depreciated, with only a small portion of exports going to other countries encouraged by the yen's devaluation. On the other hand, most of Japan's imports come from countries that have not recently devalued their currencies. These exports are sold to Japan at much higher prices. The 15% devaluation of the yen automatically increases the value of the US dollar to Japanese importers by 18%. In recent weeks, Japanese economic newspapers have been talking about the fact that the domestic price level in Japan is higher than in most other countries. It has been several years since the recent sharp rise in world price levels is said to have readjusted the price relationship between Japan and the Anglo-Saxon countries, which is beneficial to Japan. However, the Tokyo government can only maintain this benefit if it can curb the continued rise in domestic prices in Japan and the depreciation of the yen. The Tokyo government has little hope of success in this regard, and the official regulation stipulates that prices must not exceed the level of September 18, but extremely important commodities such as silk cotton fabrics and rice have already exceeded this level. It appears that the domestic price level in Japan will continue to soar.

In summary, Japan's foreign trade is currently encountering unprecedented difficulties and obstacles. The Tokyo government has so far been unable to find a way to solve any of the urgent major problems of Japan's foreign commerce. Tokyo will mostly follow a path of least resistance, turning to its occupied territories in China for assistance, reducing exports of Japanese goods to the yen bloc area, and at the same time intensifying its extraction of any kind of raw materials or other supplies it can obtain in the territories it occupies in China. (The End)

The Past Week

### New Price Limit of Forty-Five Yuan

— Yu

Unscrupulous merchants are raising rice prices, and even Mr. Su Zuxun of the Rice Merchants' Association has publicly criticized them (see report in the 6th issue). From the announcement by the seven rice organizations to reorganize the rice trading procedures, one can also see traces of unscrupulous merchants disrupting the rice market. Public opinion is useless to unscrupulous merchants, otherwise they would not be unscrupulous merchants. The association's announcement is ineffective, otherwise it would not have come to this point! On the contrary, after this announcement was released, the price of rice rose even higher, reaching an unprecedented high of nearly 50 yuan per shi. All parties are eagerly looking forward to the concession authorities coming forward to impose sanctions and protect the people's food supply. Fortunately, all parties were not disappointed, and a solution came: the maximum price must not exceed 45 yuan! The common people have truly benefited greatly! However, the general capitalists are starting to worry, because they do not know how to protect the livelihoods of their employees! We hope that the Municipal Council will, based on this new price limit, issue a minimum standard for employee salaries!

### Japan's New Budget

— Yu

Japan's new budget for the next year totals 1.04 billion yuan, an increase of 100 million yuan over this year. With a printing press, there is no fear of running out of financial resources. With the Metropolitan Police Department and the Economic Police, there is also no fear of the people's resistance to strong control and high prices. The people's struggles and groans under malignant inflation can be locked up in prison so that they cannot be leaked out. An author in the "Japan Review" advocates sending prisoners to the Chinese battlefield, because he is worried about overcrowded prisons. However, the military strongly opposes this method, because anti-war sentiment in the army is already extremely high, so it is best to keep them imprisoned. However, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, etc., do not agree, because the panic about labor shortages is becoming more and more serious. Therefore, compiling a huge budget is indeed not a big problem, the problem lies in the fact that this will accelerate the process of the complete collapse of the entire Japanese economic system, and there is nothing to do about it.

Commercial News

### Rice Market Morale Drops After Price Limit Implemented, Hoarders Wait and See, High-Quality Rice Disappears, Traders Only Show Samples of Inferior Goods

Yesterday, sources from the inland were still under the control of a certain party, the number was very small, and more than ten cars of Kuntai goods were transported back halfway, suffering great obstacles, and only four or five cars of goods arrived in the Sujia area. This time, the price of rice has soared continuously, reaching nearly 50 yuan. Although it is said that the source is blocked, in fact, the stock in the warehouse is abundant, and huge amounts of foreign rice are continuously arriving. The price of rice really has no reason to be so expensive. It is all caused by general hoarders and speculators. The Soybean and Rice Merchants' Association specially convened seven rice organizations to discuss at length and decided to impose price limits again. Yesterday, it has been announced that the price of japonica rice is limited to 45 yuan, foreign rice and Kejian rice are 38 yuan, medium and inferior rice are priced separately, and other goods are not included. Both buyers and sellers must abide by the rules from the date of the announcement, and must not privately violate them, otherwise, once reported and confirmed, they will be severely fined, and no leniency will be granted. Morale suddenly plummeted. Hoarders' goods, whose own goods are outside the price limit, are hidden and not sold. Traders also only show samples of inferior goods. High-quality japonica rice has disappeared from the market. Saigon and Kejian rice had previously been sold for around 39 yuan, and the overall trend is similar. As for those who come as guests, they dare not enter rashly. Therefore, yesterday's market was almost invisibly stagnant under the mutual rejection of buyers and sellers. Only some goods that are not subject to restrictions are slightly fought for in the market. It is estimated that the restricted goods that were opened include Kun japonica rice at 44 yuan and 8 jiao to 44 yuan and a half, Lisheng japonica rice at 43 yuan, Qing Si thin rice at 42 or 3 yuan, Fengjia early and late rice at 41 or 2 yuan to 40 yuan, and Saigon at 38 yuan only opened 300 bags, and Kejian rice at 38 yuan opened 500 bags. Those that are not restricted include Saigon broken rice at 35 yuan and 2 jiao to 34 yuan and a half, broken foreign glutinous rice at 35 yuan, broken Tokyo Jian rice at 36 yuan and 3 jiao, and 36 yuan, Jingwu broken rice at 36 yuan and a half, 36 yuan, and local Jian rice Wuyou Changbang Bianwuyuan at 44 or 5 yuan, Nanbang Yinyuan at 43 or 4 yuan, Lujian special rice at 43 yuan, Zhongshi goods at 42 yuan and a half, 42 yuan, and Yang Jian at 41 yuan to 40 yuan. The total number of transactions in the city was only more than 3,000 bags. The skyrocketing rice price has finally been able to ease the public's anxiety, but according to this price limit, although it can curb the endless rise, it is still too much for the average commoner to bear.

### Gold Prices Remain High Despite Sunday Holiday

Yesterday, the spot market for cash ingot was dull. Because it was a Sunday holiday, there were few transactions outside the market, and the trend remained firm. At first, buyers were willing to offer 4,190 yuan, but sellers had to ask for another 10 yuan on top of that price, making it 4,200 yuan. A small number of buyers with cash were willing to absorb the seller's asking price, and dozens of taels were traded. Later, because the two sides held each other off, no further transactions were heard until noon. The price of gold jewelry per tael remained unchanged all day. Data Tonghang still hung 425 yuan, and Xin Tonghang was the same as the above price, but the purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan. Also, according to a London telegram on the 9th, the price of British pure gold was still fixed at 8 pounds and 8 shillings per ounce.

### New Qing Sugar Harvest Halved

The trend of state-produced sugar remains tight. Yesterday, 200 bags of government red sugar were opened at 38 yuan, and more than 40 bags of Gongge red sugar were opened at 43 yuan and 8 jiao. According to a letter from Longxi, the harvest of this year's Qing sugar has been greatly reduced. It is estimated that the last harvest reached more than 200,000 dan, while this year's harvest is only 100,000 dan, which is half as much, due to lack of fertilizer. Therefore, it is feared that prices in the producing areas will not easily fall in the future. The Association's marked coarse white sugar has rebounded, with spot prices for coarse white sugar rising by about one yuan to 58 yuan, and re-export goods rising by another half yuan to 48 yuan. Taikoo granulated white sugar rose by 5 jiao, East Warehouse B mark was 56 yuan, West Warehouse was 56 yuan and a half, DY mark was 55 yuan, HX mark was 54 yuan and a half, and H mark car red sugar rose by one yuan to 40 yuan and a half to 41 yuan, and Dutch red sugar rose by one and a half yuan to 42 yuan to 43 yuan.

### Hainan Dried Longan Rises Another Three Yuan

Hainan dried longan is rising because there are no continued arrivals, so although the goods in the hands of the brokerage firm have not been sold out, the intention to increase is still strong. The market yesterday also traded dozens of pieces, rising another three yuan to 130 yuan.

### Sophora Japonica Rice Rebounds

Sophora japonica rice had previously been sluggish, and inferior goods had fallen to nearly 20 yuan. Recently, the stock has gradually decreased, and the sales have also increased, so the price has rebounded. High-quality goods are 34 or 5 yuan, and some are asking for 37 or 8 yuan, while ordinary goods are around 30 yuan.

### Japanese Silk Shipments to the US Sharply Reduced Last Month

At the beginning of last month, when Japanese and American silk prices were actively soaring, the reasons for this were widely debated. To sum up, there are three points: (1) Japanese silk shipments to the US have sharply decreased, (2) Seasonal factors: According to past experience, silk prices are always at the highest price of the year between November and December, (3) The United States passed the Neutrality Act, which actually put the United States in the position of a belligerent country, and the domestic economic life had to deepen its impact. Regarding the first point, the New York raw silk statistics for November are now recorded for readers to study.

According to the above table, the New York market trend last month was not very tight, and both imports and sales declined. Although the inventory increased, the Japanese silk item decreased sharply by 14.893 dan compared with the import volume of the previous month, which is almost half of the total amount in November. The impact on the market is not small.

Sexual Hygiene

### Why Do Many Men

— Russian Labor University, Sexual Dysfunction After Marriage?

In today's society, there are often many tragic divorces. Although there are many reasons for these tragedies, the main point is due to the inability to integrate love. Because the love between men and women must be forged from health, if you lose this healthy body, then no matter how superior your living environment is, it will be in vain!

To maintain our health so that it is not lost due to married life, the first question depends on maintaining virginity before marriage and avoiding self-indulgence. After marriage, it is even more important to practice restraint, so that the love between the sexes will not be ruined by a temporary lack of fertility. But if there is indeed a reproductive dysfunction, you must not avoid medical treatment. In addition to paying extra attention to reproductive hygiene, you should also use the most effective German youth glandular preparation for men, "Buti Kang", then reproductive power will return to youth, and love will always be new.

Although reproduction is a human innate ability, there are not a few cases where the sensory perception of sex becomes pathological, resulting in the loss of marital pleasure. In medicine, it is called sexual dysfunction, such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and the insensitivity that women often suffer from. Suffering from this is actually a symptom of one's own physical weakness. People over 40 years old, due to physiological reasons, the reproductive heat declines. This is because the youth gland that dominates sexual power changes from strong to weak. Because a person's sexual desire gradually disappears with increasing age, this is not only true for reproduction, but also for the spirit, skin, and other places. Now that we understand that reproductive health lies in the prosperity of the youth gland, the male hormone preparation "Buti Kang" invented by the German venereal disease expert Dr. Meulen is indeed a great invention of the 24th century medical crystallization. After taking it, the mind is clear, the spirit is invigorated, the complexion is rosy, the appetite is increased, and the reproductive function is very healthy, with no symptoms such as premature ejaculation or impotence. It can also promote reproductive function and help sexual organ development. It can restore the reproductive power of middle-aged people, nourish the brain, nourish the kidneys, and nourish the blood. It is a holy product for nourishing the old and the young. The female "Buti Kang" is a good medicine for regulating menstruation and treating anemia and breast atrophy. Especially for insensitivity after marriage, one dose of this medicine will make you more affectionate. However, young people suffering from nocturnal emission should also take "Nai Er Si Anti-Nocturnal Emission Tablets" in addition to "Buti Kang" to stop it, which is far more effective than sperm-locking tablets.

Gonorrhea Chronicles

### Gonorrhea's Liberation

— Written by Huang Zhongchang, MD, USA

In the history of medical progress in the 20th century, gonorrhea treatment is the most important. The most popular treatment at the beginning was the transmucosal sterilization method, but because gonococci are not completely on the mucous membrane, gonococci can be found everywhere in the blood, joints, etc. Therefore, this transmucosal sterilization method was completely declared a failure. The German medical doctor Peter made further research and used a special protein chromogen mixture to make a drug called "Kelinong". After taking it, it can generate anti-gonococcal bacteriophage in a short period of time, with the effect of anti-inflammation and pain relief. This effect can directly occur in the lesion, and can be called the only liberation treatment for gonorrhea patients.

Once a gonorrhea patient is infected by gonococci, it is like a poisonous scorpion on the body, and the pain is extraordinary. There are often absurd ideas of being tired of the world and committing suicide. And the most painful gonorrhea is no more than the symptoms of gonorrheal posterior urethritis. Because once gonorrhea enters the posterior urethra, it feels a lot of trouble. As the number of routes invaded by gonococci increases, changes also arise. If general transmucosal sterilization and chemotherapy are used, the bactericidal effect may not be able to withstand the gonococci, which are like mercury pouring down the ground and entering everywhere. This is why gonorrhea could not be completely cured in a short period of time in the past.

Now, because of the invention of "Kelinong", the treatment of gonorrhea is very different from the past. It has long been praised by doctors in Europe and the United States. According to Dr. Baisai Zhong's experiment at the venereal disease hospital he set up in New York, he said that in this hospital, no less than tens of millions of people have been treated for gonorrhea in the past twenty years. Before the invention of "Kelinong", it was very difficult to ask for a complete cure for gonorrhea. Only after the invention of "Kelinong", it is no longer as difficult as before to completely cure gonorrhea in all stages. Especially for those whose gonorrhea has invaded the posterior urethra, taking "Kelinong" can definitely cure it. The medicine is effective, and the results are excellent. In terms of external medicine, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is used to wash the urethra for men and remove gonococci. For women with gonorrhea leucorrhea, "Carter Xuedi Vaginal Tablets" can be used externally as suppositories to eliminate gonorrhea leucorrhea, which is more effective for all kinds of gonorrhea in men and women. It is also in line with the principle of family self-treatment.

### Colds Turn into Consumption

— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang

Patient Jin Zhenquan, 33 years old, the hometown was occupied last winter, so he fled with the crowd. At that time, heavy snow was flying and the wind was very tight. He felt cold and coughed endlessly. Because he relied on his strong physique and was distraught, he did not seek medical treatment. But since last spring, he suddenly felt a stabbing pain in his chest and had a lot of thick phlegm, so he took medicine for treatment, but it was ineffective. By last autumn, the consumption became more and more serious, with fever and night sweats. He came to me for treatment. I immediately ordered him to rest and take "Bufei Naer" internally. Mr. Jin respected my words and acted accordingly. In less than a month, the fever had subsided and the thick phlegm had gradually decreased. After taking it for more than two months, all the symptoms disappeared and he was as strong as before. He is now working in a company. The reason why "Bufei Naer" can achieve such miraculous effects is because its ingredients are purely refined, so it is by no means accidental.

### Effective Medicine for Treating Nocturnal Emission

Nocturnal emission is indeed the most serious problem that hinders the development and health of young people. With the progress of modern medicine, the treatment of nocturnal emission has reached the peak of perfection. However, there are many patients who are confused by the propaganda of sperm-locking drugs with low efficacy, which delays the disease and wastes money. According to our experience in treating this disease over the years, the "Nai Er Si Anti-Nocturnal Emission Tablets" invented by German venereal disease experts are indeed extremely effective, because the ingredients of the drug mainly include sleeping pills to strengthen the brain and relieve the oversensitivity of the ejaculation center. Unlike other sperm-locking tablets that contain tyrannical ingredients to paralyze the sperm gate, not only may they not be effective quickly, but once the medicine is stopped, nocturnal emission will definitely break out again, or even become more severe. This is the same reason as using morphine to treat opium addiction. We, standing as doctors, hereby solemnly advise patients that those who have taken other sperm-locking tablets and feel that the old disease is difficult to cure, then "Nai Er Si Anti-Nocturnal Emission Tablets" are worth a try. After taking it, you can be sure that your mind will be clear, you will sleep peacefully at night, you will not have erotic dreams, and the sperm gate will be strengthened day by day. Nocturnal emission is cured, but at the same time, you should abstain from self-indulgence, and those who have kidney deficiency and neurasthenia should also supplement with the German testicular essence preparation for men, "Buti Kang", to strengthen yin and nourish blood. Taking the two medicines together has a special effect. In addition, what has been confirmed clinically.

Gonorrhea Symposium

### Effective Treatment for Stubborn Leucorrhea

— Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road

Once gonorrhea becomes chronic, because there are many changes and the bacteria are distributed everywhere, it is like a fire that has already spread, and it is quite difficult to extinguish it for a while. Because there are many of its followers and hundreds of changes occur, not only gonorrhea patients are shocked and surprised, but also doctors with insufficient experience and broad knowledge are often at a loss as to what kind of symptoms it is. As a result, gonorrhea is becoming more and more dangerous, and it cannot be quickly eliminated. It has become a stubborn leucorrhea that cannot be attacked for a long time or shaved away. At that time, gonorrhea patients already feel that their lives are in danger. If they still hesitate at this time, then the consequences of gonorrhea are even more unimaginable.

In patients with stubborn and most dangerous gonorrhea, systemic gonorrheal infectious gonorrhea is the most dangerous. Among systemic gonorrheal infections, arthritis and sepsis are the most dangerous diseases. Because the former can make the joints of the limbs become more and more inflamed, making movement inflexible, and resembling a disability. As for the latter, sepsis is caused by gonorrhea, and there is often the misfortune of causing life to collapse immediately. Therefore, in the case of such viruses, local surgical treatment must not be used to solve them, but the special medicine for gonorrhea "Kelinong" must be used to make the bactericidal power directly reach the lesion, and completely eliminate the gonococci scattered in the joints and blood. Because "Kelinong" can produce an anti-gonococcal effect in the shortest time after taking it, surrounding all the gonococci and killing them. On the one hand, it can assist the German anti-gonorrhea serum, induction electrotherapy, Wettere X therapy, which can eliminate the remaining toxins of gonorrhea and decompose the adhered joints, so that the movement is free. Even for gonorrheal sepsis, it can be saved. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM Every day from today, 20 numbers will be sent for consultation, and only 5 jiao will be charged for each number, and a complete book on venereal diseases will be given as a gift. It also treats syphilis, scrofula, chancroid, and sexual neurasthenia.

Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

### Rice Prices Rise Again

— Lu Lishi

This is truly an unprecedented event. During the harvest season, rice prices are soaring. In previous years, the rice price at this time would have been at most a little over one yuan per dan. Selling white rice for fifteen or sixteen yuan would have been considered rare. Therefore, everyone treated this issue of "food as the paramount necessity of the people" with calm indifference. But what about now? Thirty yuan per shi of rice, and you still can't get it even with money in hand. Is there a shortage of rice? Looking at the rice shops, the warehouses are piled high. And upon further inquiry, there is no shortage of rice stored in warehouses throughout Shanghai. So, why haven't rice prices come down?

There are several reasons for this. First, the sources are not ideal. Often, large quantities of "rice sources" are suddenly "detained" by someone. As a result, the market undergoes changes, and prices fluctuate unpredictably. Clever merchants will naturally fish in troubled waters. Therefore, the price of rice staying at its peak is to be expected.

Another point is the tactics of profiteers. Even though their own shops and warehouses are filled with goods, as soon as they hear that rice is being transported, they devise ways to compete for purchases. The more buyers, the less the rice price falls. As a result, the rice shop owners' pockets keep getting "makka, makka," while the poor ordinary people suffer. As severe winter approaches, which of the essentials—clothing, food, housing, and transportation—should be addressed first? I think, although the concession authorities and philanthropists attach great importance to this issue and try to find solutions as much as possible, all this is "laborious" like trying to get fish from a tree because this issue is related to the country's problems. There is only one method that we can work together to achieve, which can indeed be effective on the passive side, which is "saving rice." For example, if everyone reduces their daily ration of one sheng by one-tenth, eating eight he instead of one sheng, then the stomach will not necessarily remain unbearable. Individual families can thereby save on economic expenditure, and the "supply of quantity" in the entire society can also be reduced. In the past, eating rice costing twenty yuan per dan was acceptable; now, eating seven dou of rice costing twenty yuan is also acceptable. In this way, perhaps the major concern of people's livelihood can now be somewhat alleviated.

### Adding New Clothes

— Chen Liang

With rice as precious as pearls and firewood as expensive as cinnamon, clothing materials are naturally no exception to being cheap. The cost of a set of short woolen cloth shirts and pants is also seven or eight yuan, not to mention long robes. Usually, those costing more than ten yuan are already considered decent, but now a robe costing more than twenty yuan is still not presentable. A small employee's monthly salary is not enough to drape on the body. Therefore, they will not add new clothes unless absolutely necessary. This is a case of prices forcing you to be frugal.

But when you must add new clothes, you can't just focus on small calculations. One zhang and four chi of clothing material is enough. If you want to save five cun of money and only buy one zhang and three chi and a half, the tailor will not have enough to cut. By barely stretching the clothing material with surgery, making it and wearing it on the body, in less than two days, the clothes will shrink. After washing in water, they will become even shorter. Being greedy for small gains will lead to great losses. How utterly not worth it.

When cutting clothing material, you must not only cut enough, but you may as well cut five cun or one chi more. Once the collar or neckline is worn out, there is still extra material to resew a collar to match, because clothing materials have many patterns and colors, and you cannot buy them in stores. Even if there are, stores may not welcome small transactions of two or three cun. The hem is also easily damaged. Having more spare material for repairs provides peace of mind.

Although we don't have to be cattle and horses for clothes, we have to cherish such expensive materials at all times. When going out to negotiate business, it is necessary to take into account the appearance and examine the clothing. However, at home or in the office, when meeting with guests, just wear old robes or old cotton-padded jackets, or add a jacket that is easy to wash. Many Chinese middle-class people wear silk and woolen fabrics as everyday wear. After they are worn out, they raise funds to add new ones. This is really being a slave to clothes.

If it is a wool-lined robe, if the outer fabric and lining are broken, the wool cloth in the middle will not be broken. You can just take it out and replace it in a new robe. If one chi costs a few jiao, you can also save one or two yuan. Also, long robes that are broken at the hem can be cut and altered into short jackets. If the sleeves of short jackets are broken, they must also be altered into vests. With a small effort, you can contribute to the economy a lot.

### Idle Chat about Bridges

— Shen Xishen

The construction of bridges is originally for facilitating transportation and developing traffic, so that people and goods on both the north and south or east and west banks, as well as all culture, can flow back and forth, benefiting the people and providing convenience to the public. This is common knowledge!

In the countryside of the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area, because the rivers and harbors are vertical and horizontal, and the Yongliu intersect, the bridges are not very numerous. Even if there are, they are not a few wooden logs or a few stone slabs. Most of them are very simple. Sometimes, due to the absence of a bridge, you have to make a big detour, wasting time and effort. This is the burden of not having a bridge! But in large cities, the situation is different. Look at the short Suzhou River in Shanghai, and there are several bridges! It is truly "pedestrians like shuttles, carriages and horses like dragons." The convenience of going back and forth and the benefits of traffic are far beyond what ordinary rural areas can match.

In general towns in the interior, most of them still maintain old-fashioned bridges: stone steps stacked into layers. Although walking is still convenient, it hinders the progress of the wheels. Therefore, some towns have demolished and rebuilt these bridges and rebuilt them into slightly inclined flat bridges so that the wheels can move forward easily and get the benefit of traffic.

The exquisite construction of new-style bridges is truly admirable! Cement and steel bones, stone poles and iron pillars, how strong they are built! The bridge surface is flat and wide. No matter what kind of grass vehicle, it can pass without hindrance. How great is the effect! This is the advantage of Western material civilization!

Writing this, I can't help but remember the north and south bridges that were related to the War of Resistance Against Japan. One is the Lugou Bridge in Wanping, Hebei, where the prelude to the national War of Resistance Against Japan was opened! The other is the Qiantang River Bridge in Hangzhou. This bridge has been built for a long time, and it has only started construction in recent years. The magnitude of the project and the cost of the project can be described as unprecedented in our country! And the relationship between this Qianjiang Bridge and the contribution to the traffic of several southeastern provinces in the future is naturally very significant! It was completed in the 26th year of the Republic of China, but unfortunately, the war broke out! And the great building, which was painstakingly managed and took several years, was destroyed overnight! This is really regrettable!

### One Week Economic Menu

— Ms. Hua Ying

In recent days, I don't know where a batch of shrimp came from. There are quite a few of them, big and small, and the price is not too expensive. So we can take this opportunity to eat some shrimp. The simplest way to eat shrimp is to grab shrimp. After soaking them thoroughly in good soy sauce, mix some fermented bean curd in it. It is most suitable for drinking or porridge. If you pay attention to hygiene and do not like semi-raw things, how about fried shrimp? If you talk about economics, you can't do without auxiliary products, such as braised shrimp with Hucong, braised shrimp with shredded bean curd, braised shrimp with shredded radish, and shrimp and eggs, which are all delicious. There is also a cooking method that uses rice wine lees to braise together. The freshness of the shrimp and the aroma of rice wine lees complement each other. And the rice wine lees can also be eaten. If you throw it away without eating, it is a waste of natural resources.

### General Wu Peifu's Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation

— Yin Hong

Since General Wu Peifu's death and the sealing of the coffin, everyone has admitted that he is "the keeper of Eastern culture and the perfect man in Chinese history." General Wu's ability to be so respected and admired is, of course, due to the many respectable historical facts, such as "firmly upholding his integrity when trapped in heavy encirclement, remaining loyal and upright even when surrounded by treacherous and evil people, and not being subdued by power or corrupted by wealth," as stated in the Shin Pao editorial. However, at the same time, looking at General Wu's four major elements of daily life—clothing, food, housing, and transportation—he was also an honest, frugal, and simple person, and there are many aspects that can serve as an example for us. I will write them down later.

General Wu Peifu once dominated the political scene and was famous for a time during the early years of the Republic of China. However, although he held a prominent position, he was inherently firm, self-disciplined, and shared joys and sorrows with his subordinates. Therefore, when it comes to his clothing, in addition to the few sets of essential military uniforms when he was in office, he did not have any suits or fancy clothes. After being defeated and returning from the Battle of Tingsi Bridge around the 15th year of the Republic of China, he retired and closed his doors to guests, not caring about worldly affairs. As for the military uniforms he used to wear, it is said that there were more than a dozen of them, including the general's uniform, all of which were stored in boxes. Afterwards, he changed to wearing Chinese clothes, which he has used to this day without change. However, all of his clothing materials were made in China, and there was absolutely no non-domestic product. The same was true for his family members. As for Western clothes, General Wu never wore them in his life.

Regarding his food preferences, he can be described as "eating lightly and plainly." He personally liked spicy flavors, and almost every dish had to be added, probably because he was from Shandong! And he loved to eat "spicy eel" the most. The so-called "spicy eel" is actually the "deep-fried eel" that we Jiangzhe people eat. Originally, we regarded it as an ordinary food, but when we first put the live eel into the pot to cook, adding some chili peppers, the taste after cooking is indeed quite delicious. I remember General Wu once wrote a poem saying: "Proudly in the plate like a proud dragon, the fragrant and spicy green onion fills the air; after all, Wei Lang has many different flavors, and it is a great pleasure for a famous scholar to taste it," which is singing about his "spicy eel."

General Wu's hometown of Penglai County, Shandong Province, has an old-fashioned residence, which was built in the 13th year of the Republic of China. The house is not necessarily very magnificent, it is just like the private residence of a middle-upper class person. Because the location is limited, the three-entry courtyard cannot be said to have any pavilions and towers. After being defeated in the 17th year of the Republic of China, he once went to Sichuan, but soon lived in Beijing City. For nearly eleven years until now, he has closed his doors to guests all day long, enjoying his old age in a narrow room. It is precisely because of General Wu's integrity throughout his life that this house in Beijing was not built by him. It is said that it was the former residence of one of his old subordinates, specially given to him.

Speaking of General Wu's "travel," let's read his self-elegy couplet: "When successful, he had a pure heart, did not take concubines, did not accumulate money, drank wine and wrote poetry, still the true color of a scholar. After failure, he was stubborn to the end, did not go abroad, did not go to the concession, watered the garden and held a pot, truly returned to the field." From his "did not go abroad, did not go to the concession," we can know that he was a person with great integrity. His "travel," except for climbing the famous mountains and rivers of central China when he was once dominating the political scene, he had no interest in "travel." Since arriving in Beijing, for eleven years, he has not stepped outside the city, spending his days drinking wine and writing poetry as a pastime.

Spring and Autumn

### Rotten Rice Seen at the Bottom of the Rice Warehouse / Frozen Corpses Found on the Road

— Zhang Zhenshan

A series of clumsy military cargo trucks drove to the tall warehouse made of steel-reinforced concrete. The driver stretched out a hand and shouted loudly to the people in the warehouse: "Five hundred bags!"

"Here it comes!" A group of coolies rushed out of the warehouse door in response to this hurried shout, their strong hands tying a cloth belt around their waists.

"Come!" With a sound, a fully-loaded sack slid onto a shoulder, dragging a long and hurried cry, like a moan or a sigh, and quickly walked into the warehouse. The second person, the third person, and even the ninth and tenth people, were all busy connecting to each other, running back and forth, carrying on their shoulders.

I walked into the warehouse. A friend who accompanied me introduced me to a friend who was in charge of the warehouse. He guided us to browse. So I opened my eyes and looked: A burst of stimulation passed from the optic nerve through the brain nerve, like joy and hate! Those bags of rice were neatly and regularly stacked, from the ground to the roof, from the door to the dark inside, stacked upon stacked. The huge warehouse only had a church-style aisle in the middle, surrounded by rice. White powder seeped into the air, spreading and broadcasting the fragrance of rice.

Walking, walking, I strolled along, passing the window of a small accounting room. The telephone on the desk was ringing violently, as if crazy. The friend in charge of the warehouse picked up the receiver: "Hello! Oh! Three hundred bags, got it." He put down the receiver, turned around, and instructed a foreman-like person: "The second boss called and said that another three hundred bags have arrived and will be delivered at four o'clock." The foreman let out a burst of "Oh, oh!" in response, his eyes then shooting at the gaps in the rice pile. Perhaps he was planning the location of the stacking? I pondered secretly in my heart.

At this time, the telephone bell rang again like crazy. I had no intention of paying attention to it, just walking, looking, and a very naive question floated in my heart: "Hundreds of bags, hundreds of bags, only coming in and not going out, this warehouse may collapse one day? And outside this house, has anyone ever found a starving corpse?"

Suddenly, a cold air, carrying a strange smell, swept over. I lowered my head and stared: The bottom sacks were damp and dirty. I reached out and touched them again. My fingers felt like touching a fresh hairtail. I sighed at the rotten rice and bags, and said to that friend: "The rice here is already bad, isn't it? What a pity!"

"This outer warehouse is okay, the inner warehouse is even worse!" He said, leading us through an iron door into the gloomy and dark "inner warehouse." The rice was piled more fully than in the "outer warehouse." I reached out and touched the sacks. At least two bags at the bottom of each stack were already wet and rotten. My nerves were stimulated and tense, not allowing me to say polite words. I couldn't help but say to the friend in charge of the warehouse: "The rice price has risen to more than forty yuan. Instead of hoarding it here and letting it get wet and rotten, it is better to sell it. If you relax a little, those poor people who rarely get enough to eat will benefit a lot!"

"The boss doesn't care about this. He has plenty of money! Almost all the rice in this warehouse has doubled in price. Some of it was hoarded in May for eighteen yuan a head. What does it matter if a little bit goes bad? Anyway, it won't lose money."

"Then what price will they be satisfied with before they are willing to let go?"

"As a hoarder, there is no day to be satisfied. It is natural for others to starve to death, and it has nothing to do with the hoarders. Like me, I am in charge of the rice, but I can't afford forty-odd yuan a dan at home. I still use flour as food. It's really impossible to say." After speaking, he also shook his head and sighed.

I could only listen in silence, walk in silence, and smell the smell of the rice pile in silence!

Walking out the door, I bought a copy of the evening newspaper. Opening it, the headline of a news item read: "New hoarders are active, and rice prices are rising steadily." Turning it over, the headline of another news item read: "The authorities will suppress rice prices and plan legal sanctions against hoarders." On the way home, I looked back at the high warehouse like a beast, hoping that it would quickly die at the hands of hunters.

Chapter 18: Discussing Economic Prosperity and Old Market Customs / Narrating Matrimonial Plunder and Tracing Old Customs

Everyone agreed with what Zhu Ai'ren said. At this time, the train had passed Nanxiang and was approaching Shanghai. Shao Huihua had a home in Shanghai. When she arrived in Shanghai, she naturally had to go to the newspaper office to report on the duties that the museum had entrusted to her. On the one hand, she wrote special articles; on the other hand, she selected the photos she had taken; on the one hand, she delivered the documents she had collected, disclosing what could be disclosed and sending what did not need to be disclosed to the Department of Participation and Counseling for filing, and someone would take charge of it. Then she went home to entertain her mother, younger brothers, and sisters. Today happened to be Saturday. The Wu Junsu and Wu Junke sisters also had families in Shanghai, and they were still large families. As soon as they got off the train, they went home. However, in the evening, she had to go to Yu Dan Yun's place, which was what Dan Yun had instructed her to do. Or perhaps she suspected that she was looking for her to be a bridesmaid. But in recent years, Chinese weddings have often not used any male or female bridesmaids. Because marriage is not a mysterious thing, according to the old Chinese style of marriage, the bride is like a living dead person. She is not allowed to say a word, nor to smile. She can walk well on her own, but she has to be helped. And marriage is clearly a happy event, but the bride has to cry sadly. What is the reason for this? Regardless of the hot and stuffy weather, she is covered by a large square scarf, without a head or a brain, as if she has no face to see people. When acting as a bride, she is so cautious that she dares not pat herself when she is sore and dares not scratch herself when she itches. Isn't this too unfree? In the past, many brides got into trouble because they adhered too much to the old customs and were too reserved. Some died of suffocation in the sedan chair due to the hot weather. Some dared not escape because of a fire or a collapsing house. Later, the marriage was changed to a slightly simpler method, and it was already felt to be liberated and free. However, inheriting the remnants of the past, the bride is still as silent and unsmiling as before, and too reserved. Therefore, there must be bridesmaids to support her and accompany her, and the bride must be too shy at this time, even though she is very bold and free between weekdays. These things are inevitably somewhat contrived and close to pretense. Modern China does not allow those things that are close to pretense to exist again, so male and female bridesmaids in marriage ceremonies have probably been abolished. Not only that, but there are many simple marriages where you only need to register at the local marriage bureau. Whether to invite guests or not is up to you. Does it mean that those who invite guests are considered married and those who do not invite guests are not considered married? Some women wear a wedding ring on their hands, as if they belong to someone. But more than ten years ago, in Soviet Russia, they already looked down on that kind of wedding ring. They said: Is the love between men and women in these metal objects? (213)
