Editorial

### Turning Point in the World Situation

Those who are truly great statesmen in the world must rely on an understanding of their own country and an observation of changes in the world, possessing foresight and a clear understanding of the truth. In their actions, they must seize opportunities, carefully consider flexibility and firmness, act independently, and be able to advance and retreat. Only then can they place their country on a foundation of stability and expand its power to a state of prosperity. That Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States, and Russia are the six powers of the world today is no accident. It has been said before that Japan currently has no great statesmen. Looking back on those years, they defeated the Qing Dynasty and seized Korea, allied with Britain and drove back Russia, winning every battle and eventually abandoning Liaodong. Emperor Meiji's decision had its own reasons that could not be reached, but those days are gone. They reaped the rewards of the September 18th Incident and isolated themselves by rejecting the Lytton Report. At that time, the world did not dare to confront Japan's warlike ambitions, and few sympathized with China after its long period of turmoil. If Japan had stopped at that point and focused on its own development, the international position of Japan today would be unimaginable. However, with insatiable desires and a feverish mood, they eventually lost the focus of their national policy and their sense of reason. They neither understood that violence was not enough to annex China, nor did they understand that the spirit and potential of the Chinese people were enough to sustain a long-term struggle. When faced with strong resistance, they failed to know when to retreat. Despite the advice of Germany and the persuasion of other countries, they failed to change their plans. Now they are internationally isolated, and all kinds of pressure will gradually increase. Millions of soldiers have been killed or wounded on the front lines, and millions of resources have been turned into fireworks. Their essence has been exhausted, their strength has been depleted, and collapse is not far away. If they had great statesmen, they should have turned back in time, even if they could not restrain their horses on the precipice in the past. But look at the way the ruling and opposition parties in their parliament interact, they are still cowardly, hypocritical, and making inflammatory speeches to deceive the people and the world. Compared to the European statesmen in this turbulent time, how few are the words and deeds of these Japanese that hit the mark! Is it not that there is a huge difference between the Eastern and Western worlds, and between the Yellow and White races?

This newspaper previously discussed the speeches of German Chancellor Hitler, British Prime Minister Chamberlain, and US President Roosevelt. It was said that future important international actions will be closely related to these speeches, and that the international community will reserve its pessimism or optimism until Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech at the Fascist Grand Council on the 4th of this month. Even the British government is waiting to see this speech to decide whether to proceed with the British-Italian economic talks. Indeed, the focus of current international disputes and the most acute point of opposition is between France and Italy. Italy is at the forefront of the issue, and Prime Minister Mussolini is the soul of its initiative. If Mussolini makes a tough statement and puts forward conditions that France cannot accept, then Hitler, Chamberlain, and Roosevelt's painstaking efforts will all become illusions, and ultimately they will inevitably lead to Europe being stained with blood, driving millions of lives into the fire pit, and turning all civilized wealth into ashes. However, news has come that the Fascist Grand Council adjourned at midnight, and the Prime Minister's speech was not made public. However, because it was not made public, there is no way to know its content. What can be inferred is that the speech was addressed to the domestic audience and to the party, not to the international community. If it were addressed to the international community, they would have feared that it would not be spread quickly and widely enough, and there would have been no reason to keep it secret. The international crisis is here, and the world is watching, but Mussolini is so profound. Does he have a real understanding and the ability to advance and retreat? The extraordinary skills and flexibility of a great world statesman cannot be measured by ordinary standards. Compared to Japan's "pushing the cart against the wall" and pushing it all the way, considering not pushing as "losing face," how superior is he!

Furthermore, the fact that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini did not speak to the international community last night does not mean that he will be silent from now on, or that he will give up his desire for the international community, let alone that the world crisis will disappear from now on. The opportunity to speak can arise at any time, the desires of the nation have a long history, and before the Spanish Nationalist Army achieves complete victory and before the Italian volunteers withdraw, their desires will be more easily advanced, and their words will be more easily excited. So, it is still unknown how the future will unfold. However, with this postponement of the speech, there is room for diplomatic maneuvering. The greater the emotional restraint, the greater the extension of reason. With diplomatic maneuvering and the extension of reason, reasonable and legitimate desires can be easily compensated for through peaceful means. Moreover, with this wonderful pause in the overall situation, people will generally change their impression, saying that a totalitarian state is not necessarily a warlike state. This change in impression alone will inevitably lead to a more well-meaning consideration of Italy's reasonable desires. Judging from international public opinion in the near future, it will inevitably agree with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's prudence, and British Prime Minister Zhang's friendly mediation will not only involve the British-Italian economic talks. This is something that can be foreseen.

### Spanish Rebel Offensive Like a Knife Through Butter, Figueres Also Falls, President Azaña Flees to France

Perpignan, France. According to news received here, the city of Figueres in northern Spain (the seat of government after the Republican government withdrew from Barcelona) has been captured by the Nationalist forces. In addition, 50,000 government troops have been defeated on the northern front and are retreating towards the French border, having arrived at the border this afternoon. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

Perpignan, France. Spanish Republican President Azaña, accompanied by Minister of Labor Risson, drove into France at 7:00 a.m. this morning. Afterwards, a large number of vehicles followed, carrying the president's staff and luggage. It is reported that they will temporarily reside here and will go to Paris after obtaining diplomatic passports. In addition, Prime Minister Negrín and other cabinet members are said to have flown from Figueres to Valencia. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

(Rome) The city of Girona in Spain was captured by Nationalist forces today. Italian General Bitosi was injured in the battle. Girona has a cathedral built in the 15th century, which is famous throughout the world. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)

Argelès-sur-Mer. After Nationalist aircraft repeatedly bombed Figueres yesterday afternoon and this morning, women, children, and the elderly fled to France in droves. The village of Agullana is only ten kilometers from the border. A large number of refugees gathered in the village. Nationalist aircraft bombed it fiercely today, causing countless casualties among the refugees. The Republican government's various departments have moved from Figueres to other places, but traffic between this city and other places is still unimpeded, and food supplies are arriving steadily. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

### West Republican Government Denies Seeking Peace

London. It is widely rumored here tonight that the Spanish Republican government has a tendency to seek peace, but a spokesman for the Spanish Republican government has absolutely denied this. According to an announcement issued by the Spanish government at 10:40 tonight, "This rumor is completely unfounded. The government is determined to stick to its established policy and fight to the end." (AP dispatch, 4th)

### French Senator Arrives in Spain, Meets with Rebel Authorities, Arousing Suspicion in Rome

Burgos. French moderate Senator Bérard, who was ordered to come and discuss the issue of refugee accommodation with the Spanish Nationalist forces authorities, arrived here from the port of Bilbao and immediately visited Nationalist government Foreign Minister Jordana for an hour and a half. Cultural Relations Minister Daixito was also present. Bérard subsequently told reporters that he was very grateful for the warm reception by officials and civilians in the Nationalist government's territory and Foreign Minister Jordana. He is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Jordana again on the 6th of this month and will stay in Spain for several days before returning home. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

(Rome) Regarding French Senator Bérard's visit to Burgos to hold talks with the Nationalist authorities, Fascist Party members here have expressed suspicion, saying that France is now pursuing dual diplomacy, wanting Italy to fail. However, the Nationalist authorities clearly remember the friendship between Italian volunteers and the Spanish Nationalist forces fighting together and will not forget the biased attitude France held at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. France's intention is probably to send a diplomatic representative or even an ambassador to Burgos, thereby recognizing the Nationalist government, on the condition that the Nationalist forces do not approach the French border too closely. In addition to discussing the issue of repatriating Spanish refugees in France, Bérard's trip may also be to negotiate this matter with the Nationalist government authorities. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

### French-Spanish Border Heavily Guarded, Refugees Entering France Exceed 80,000

Perpignan, Southern France. Military authorities have tightened defenses on the border. The area from here to the border has been designated as a military zone. Ordinary people are not allowed to enter or exit without a special pass. The passes previously issued by the civil administration must be stamped by the military authorities to be valid. Road traffic has also been strictly managed. All pedestrians and vehicles must stop every five kilometers for inspection. Police officers are patrolling major roads in cars, while mounted police are patrolling the countryside. Food stations have been set up at most intersections to provide meals for the military and police. (Havas dispatch, 5th)

(Paris) According to reports here, as of the afternoon of the 4th, more than 80,000 Spanish refugees had moved into France, and between 10,000 and 15,000 soldiers had been detained. (Haitong dispatch, 5th)

### Japan to Have Severe Earthquake Within Next Six Weeks, Tokyo Imperial University Research Institute Issues Warning

(Tokyo) It is reported that the Earthquake Research Institute of Tokyo Imperial University issued a warning on the 3rd of this month, stating that Japan will have a major earthquake within six weeks. It is said that the warning issued by the Institute is based on its observations along the Japanese coastline of the Pacific Ocean over the past five or six years. Since many years ago, the ground along the Japanese coast has shaken more than 6,000 times, and the frequency of earthquakes was particularly high in November and December of last year. As a result, the terrain has changed, and there is a high possibility of a major earthquake disaster. (Express dispatch, 5th)

### Italy to Make Demands on France to Fulfill Natural Aspirations, France Sends Unofficial Representative to Rome, Hoping Both Sides Can Establish a Compromise Plan

(London) According to reliable sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will make demands on France within days. Their nature is still moderate, but they must be satisfied immediately. The most obvious are: 1. The Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway in French Somaliland, currently operated by a French company, should be transferred to Italy. 2. Djibouti should become a free port. 3. The legal status of Italian residents in French Tunisia in North Africa should be revised. 4. The French government should promise not to build fortifications or establish military airfields on the island of Corsica in the Mediterranean. The above are said to be Italy's minimum demands. If they are not satisfied immediately, Prime Minister Mussolini may threaten to make territorial demands. In addition, it is rumored that radical elements of the Italian Fascist Party intend to provoke incidents with France in the aviation field, hoping to trigger a crisis that would prompt British Prime Minister Chamberlain and German leader Hitler to act as arbitrators. Political figures here commented that if Italy pursues a more adventurous policy, it may not be supported by Germany. Italy's demands on France are still moderate, and the intention is to obtain Germany's support. In addition, although Italy and Germany maintain an advantage in the air force, this advantage will disappear as soon as this spring due to the United States selling aircraft to Britain and France. This is another reason why Italy is eager to be satisfied by France. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

(Paris) According to reliable sources in the French government speaking to AP reporters, the French government is now trying to resolve the conflict between the two countries in the Mediterranean with Italy through informal private talks. The French side now plans to send Rothschild Bank Chairman Bauptain to Rome for an unofficial visit to explore a compromise solution to Mussolini's territorial demands on France. Although Bauptain does not represent the government on this trip, he certainly has the government's mission and has been authorized by the French government to negotiate a compromise with Mussolini. It is said that the French compromise plan is to have France and Italy jointly manage and operate the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway and to make Djibouti a free port for Italy to enter and exit Abyssinia, but it maintains a firm position of being unable to help with Italy's territorial demands. (AP dispatch, 4th)

### Britain Plans to Inquire About Germany's True Intentions Through Diplomatic Channels, Soviet Diplomacy Is Flexible, Britain Fears German-Soviet Rapprochement

(London) According to authoritative sources, the British Cabinet decided at a meeting on Thursday to test Hitler's intentions through diplomatic means because of Hitler's declaration on Monday. They said that if Germany really intends to open formal peace negotiations, British Prime Minister Chamberlain will be prepared to suggest to Hitler that a joint British-German declaration be issued, stating that both sides are committed to formal peace negotiations, and France and Italy will also participate. At the same time, diplomatic advisors believe that the atmosphere is still very tense, so it seems that this plan is of little benefit to Germany. However, it is said that Chamberlain's general colleagues are very optimistic and believe that Germany's opinions are indeed tending towards European harmony. According to reliable sources, the United Kingdom does not fully understand Germany's true opinions regarding colonies because Germany has not issued any formal requests, so the United Kingdom plans to temporarily ignore this issue. (AP dispatch, 4th)

(London) According to reliable sources, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds recently submitted a report to the Foreign Office, stating that Soviet foreign policy has become more flexible than in the past. The Soviet authorities have provided assurances that they will abide by the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty and maintain friendship with Western European countries, but they also expect those countries to make some sacrifices. After reading the report, the British government is deeply concerned that Soviet foreign policy may change course and become closer to Germany. It has ordered Ambassador Seeds to strive for closer ties with the Soviet Union in economic and political terms. Since then, trade figures between the two sides are expected to increase, and the United Kingdom will provide credit facilities to the Soviet Union. As for political negotiations, the ambassadors of both sides should maintain close contact with the governments of the countries where they are stationed. All assistance from the British government, which used to be notified to Soviet Ambassador Maisky after the fact, will be notified as soon as possible in the future. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

### Hungarian Envoy to Soviet Union Ordered to Return Home

(Moscow) After the Soviet Union severed diplomatic relations with Hungary, personnel at the Hungarian embassy were instructed by the Hungarian government to depart tomorrow and return home. Hungary's interests in the Soviet Union have been entrusted to the Polish embassy for protection. (Havas dispatch, 4th)

### Recruiting Young Men and Women for Colonial Talent, Providing Special Training

(Berlin) Germany trains hundreds of young men and women every year, preparing to relocate these young men and women to various places once the colonies lost during the European War are recovered. In addition, German doctors are receiving special training at the Hamburg School of Maritime and Tropical Medicine, and there is also a colonial administration school with special subjects in both theory and practice. If Germany's demands are met, it can immediately take over and manage the colonies without any difficulty. In Runstau, Holstein, there is a women's colonial school where German women aged 18 to 22 can enroll. They receive special training to be suitable as wives of general colonists. The school is directly under the command of the National Socialist Party's political colonial department and places more emphasis on instilling National Socialist ideology and eugenics and racial theories. In addition, modern life necessities such as horseback riding, driving cars, rowing, and shooting are also compulsory courses. The school's tuition and all expenses are very low, and the selection of students is not strict, so many students are enrolled. In Weidenhofen, there is also a similar male school that places special emphasis on tropical issues and teaches chemistry, mechanics, agriculture, and craft courses. After completing all the required courses, a diploma can be obtained. The school also plans to issue a notice saying, "Parents should send their children to study because overseas land can guarantee their future." (AP dispatch, 4th)

### Japanese Military Supplementary Budget Exceeds 6 Billion Yuan, Ministry of Finance Demands Reduction, Friction Occurs Between Army and Navy

(Tokyo) In the fiscal year beginning April 1, the supplementary budget for the Japanese army and navy will exceed 6 billion yuan (equivalent to £350 million). According to the figures submitted by the Army Ministry to the Ministry of Finance, the army's expenditure alone, including regular, temporary, and special items, will reach about 5.4 billion yuan (equivalent to £320 million). The army's expenditure for the current fiscal year is 3.821 billion yuan (equivalent to £225 million). The next budget is based on the so-called "two-power standard." Japan aims to be fully prepared to deal with China and the Soviet Union simultaneously if necessary. This estimate is to maintain the increase of Japanese troops in China, garrison troops in "Manchukuo," and replenish the air force and adjust military supplies. The regular military budget for the next fiscal year has been set at 490 million yuan, compared to 566 million yuan this year. The reduction is because the Manchurian temporary emergency expenses, which have always been included in the regular budget, have been allocated as part of the special military expenses for the 1939-1940 fiscal year. It is widely rumored that the navy has had major friction with the army because the army's huge military expenditure has hindered the navy's expansion. In the fiscal year beginning April 1, Japan's military budget will be 5.4 billion yuan, but it is expected that the Ministry of Finance will reduce it to 5 billion yuan. As for the expenses required by the navy, they have not yet been announced. However, judging from its declaration of wanting to build huge military equipment to protect the control of neighboring oceans, it can be seen that the navy will propose an important new ship-building program. The navy's regular budget for the next fiscal year is estimated to be 653 million yuan, a decrease of 27 million yuan from this year, because the naval war expenses in China have been allocated to special expenses. It is generally expected that the total amount of the navy's special budget will be around 1.2 billion yuan. Therefore, the total naval expenditure for the next fiscal year will reach 1.853 billion yuan (equivalent to £110 million). It is estimated that the total amount of special budgets for the army and navy will be approximately 7.2 billion yuan, and the total budget, including regular, temporary, and special expenses, will be 7.35 billion yuan (equivalent to £430 million).

### Japanese Budget Committee Questions Situation

(Hong Kong) Tokyo News: The Japanese House of Representatives Budget Committee has begun to review the budget proposals by division. The subcommittee members have held meetings since the 3rd. At a meeting of the fourth subcommittee on the 4th, Minseito Party member Nakajima asked, "Former Army Chief Tojo Hideki once said that there were no defects in the Soviet equipment, is that still the case?" Sakata replied, "A portion of the Soviet equipment was transferred to the Chinese theater of war, and it is currently being replenished." From this question, it can be seen that Japan's Soviet equipment is weaker than before the war. In the near future, it may not dare to provoke the Soviet Union. At a meeting of the first subcommittee, a member asked, "For the sake of national defense, anti-communism, and security, will the army continue to station troops in China?" Sakata replied, "There is no reason to withdraw troops during the war. Even to build a new order, considerable military force is required." Minseito Party member Koyama Kazou asked, "How will the interests of third countries in China be resolved? Does the government intend to convene an international conference?" Sakata replied, "The idea of convening an international conference is good, but it has not yet been considered and will be studied." Sakata's reply was different in tone from Arita's previous reply in the Budget Committee. Arita was skeptical, while Sakata seemed to express approval, which is noteworthy. (Dispatch, 5th)

### Conflict Erupts Again on Russian-Manchurian Border, Japanese Troops Provoke by Crossing Border, Repelled by Russian Defenders

(Harbin) On February 4, a conflict between Japanese and Soviet sentries occurred on the northeastern border, 100 kilometers from Manzhouli. It is reported that on the 4th, Japanese sentries crossed the border three times—at 5:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., and 11:30 a.m.—and attacked Soviet outposts, but were bravely repelled by Soviet defenders. The Japanese offensive was purely exploratory in nature. Every time it saw a Soviet counterattack, it retreated in panic. Therefore, there were no casualties on either side yesterday.

Sex Hygiene

### Love and Marriage Age Matters Greatly

— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University

To study the love between husband and wife, the age of both parties at the time of marriage must be taken into consideration. From a physiological point of view, the appropriate age for marriage should be when both the man and woman have reached maturity in mind and body, and when their judgment and character are fully developed. In other words, the proper age for marriage is between 23 or 24 and 26 or 27 for men, and between 20 and 23 or 24 for women. Being too early or too late is detrimental and unhelpful.

Early marriage not only harms one's own health and shortens one's lifespan, but also brings disaster to future generations. If a woman marries too early, her beauty will easily fade, and she will not be able to live out her natural lifespan. If a man marries too early, his physical strength will decline, and his sexual vigor will be easily damaged. Some men, due to early marriage, will damage the development of their reproductive organs and often suffer from infertility. Even if they do have children, they will be weak in every way.

Furthermore, the age of marriage has a significant relationship with the love between husband and wife. Why is this? Because the love between husband and wife comes from a healthy life, and happiness after marriage can only be enjoyed if sexual vigor is sound.

In today's hectic and complex life, our energy is often dissipated, and we age prematurely. We are unable to care for the development of love between husband and wife, so the sexual response of men tends to increase rapidly, while the sexual response of women becomes sluggish. This invisibly creates a chasm between the love of men and women. To fill this chasm, one can only start by increasing essence and replenishing blood, actively promoting the prosperity of the youth glands. Even if age has increased, one can still use this to rejuvenate and relive the joy of youthful health, because after the youth glands are strong, this discrepancy in sexual response between men and women can be transformed into harmony.

From a medical point of view, the reason why a person's energy is strong is none other than the prosperity of the youth glands. Therefore, if one can maintain the health of these youth glands, everything can be managed. If patients are aware of this deficiency, they can take "Buti Kang," a testicular essence preparation for men. This agent generates essence and strengthens the kidneys in a short period of time. Any weakness or incomplete development can be cured. After the husband takes it, he can make his wife's love lingering, and the joy of marital relations will be better than a newlywed couple's. Furthermore, "Buti Kang" has been tested by doctors in various countries and proven to be the best preparation for treating sexual weakness. Women with weakened bodies and irregular menstruation can take "Buti Kang" for women.

### Introducing a Good Medicine for Treating the Lungs

— Sheng Zaiqiang, Physician

Based on my clinical experiments with lung diseases over the past 26 or 27 years, the medicine "Bu Fei Na Er" can truly be called a sacred remedy for lung diseases. This is because its ingredients are pure, and it aims to nourish the lungs and treat consumption. Therefore, no matter how difficult to completely cure the cough, after taking it for three hours, it can relieve cough and resolve phlegm with incredible effectiveness. It can not only cure coughs in a short period of time but also completely cure extremely dangerous pulmonary tuberculosis. According to my detailed statistics, for coughs caused by influenza and pulmonary catarrh, only taking "Bu Fei Na Er" can cure them radically in a short period of time. If other medicines are taken, they will inevitably linger and become chronic diseases.

### Gonorrhea Lecture

— Narrated by Dr. Yao Juyan

Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road

Multiple Prostatitis

Cutting off the root of the disease, avoiding its many changes

Whenever gonorrhea turns chronic, its complications are bound to be numerous. When treating it, we must not abandon the fundamentals and pursue the superficial; we must cut off the root of the disease in order to hope that it will never recur. However, most patients do not seek this, but instead adopt a "treat the head when it hurts, treat the foot when it hurts" approach. Over-the-counter medicines also arise in response to the situation, like bamboo shoots after the rain, flourishing and growing. However, gonorrhea is seen to spread. Why is this? It is because, as I pointed out above, the root of the gonorrhea poison is not fundamentally resolved, but only superficial effects are sought, in order to gain the patient's trust. Among them, prostatitis, a symptom of gonorrhea, is the most prone to repeated changes. Many gonorrheal prostatitis cases, once past the acute phase, gradually show a lack of subjective symptoms, so patients do not feel any pain and tend to treat it lightly. However, once they exert themselves or after sexual activity, it recurs. Furthermore, in many cases, gonorrhea bacteria cannot be detected even with prostatic massage because the gonorrhea bacteria have penetrated deep into the interior of the glands and cannot be forced out by massage.

Taking Advantage of the Opportunity to Make Trouble, Suspicious and Fearful

Since gonorrhea bacteria cannot be forced out by general surgery, they often come out to take advantage of the opportunity to make trouble, making people suspicious and fearful, unclear about the situation, and randomly trying injections and medications, making it even more difficult to subdue the gonorrhea bacteria. After I always use microscopes and other methods to check the condition, I use German static electricity therapy and X-ray electrotherapy. The electric heat power can penetrate the small glands of the prostate. I also administer the gonorrhea remedy "Ke Lin Nong" as an internal medicine to resist gonorrhea phagocytes, which has an even greater effect and can often be cured in a short period of time, eliminating the root of recurrence. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 patients will be seen each day, with a registration fee of only five jiao per number.

### The Crisis and Rescue of Gonorrhea

— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang

Purulent Discharge Emphasizes Radical Cure; Complications Must Be Considered Simultaneously

International Medical Conference Points Out the Right Path for Treatment!

The rampant spread of gonorrhea is indeed related to economics. Therefore, the recession is sweeping across the entire land. When people are panicking about bread, who has the ability to support a wife? Therefore, under the capitalist system, humanity deeply feels the threat of economic panic. Marriage can only be enjoyed by the wealthy class. For some vast impoverished masses or petty bourgeoisie, marriage can only be regarded as a special right.

However, people in the wealthy class are no different physiologically. They also demand the comfort of the opposite sex. Therefore, prostitution has become a common phenomenon in society. It is no wonder that gonorrhea, caused by prostitution, is becoming increasingly prevalent. According to research by renowned scholars, the most terrifying crisis for people suffering from syphilis, regardless of gender, is periostitis and arthritis, which often cause limb deformities and hunchbacks. Secondly, the gonorrhea poison further enters the bone marrow, which can lead to sudden death! Especially when it causes meningitis, it is extremely dangerous. Regarding the treatment of gonorrhea, according to a world-renowned paper published in 1932 by Mr. Ke Luman, an expert in gonorrhea: "Providing a Special Therapy for Gonorrhea," in addition to stating that "Ke Lin Nong" must be taken for gonorrhea, it also pointed out that "Ke Lin Nong" is made by Dr. Peter of Germany using a mixture of protein and yellow pigment based on non-specific therapy. Its sterilization and anti-gonorrhea power can reach all cells, so systemic gonorrhea infection, arthritis, etc., cannot be conquered without "Ke Lin Nong." Therefore, all other new and old cases of purulent discharge await the treatment of "Ke Lin Nong" before they can be cured radically, and the use of "Ke Lin Nong" for gonorrhea has become a widespread phenomenon among clinicians in various countries! Since I returned to China from the United States, I have cured countless cases of gonorrhea with "Ke Lin Nong," and the reason why other outdated over-the-counter medicines are no match for "Ke Lin Nong" is entirely due to the remarkable efficacy of this agent.

### Several Points to Note in the Treatment of Seminal Emission

— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting

In order to cure seminal emission, in addition to drug therapy, the following points must also be noted:

You must get out of bed immediately upon awakening in the morning; do not delay. Before going to bed, do five minutes of indoor and outdoor exercises to tire your muscles and bones, making it easier to fall asleep. Places where men and women mingle, such as theaters, dance halls, and amusement parks, should be avoided. Young women should be seen less. Do not talk about trivial matters between men and women. Do not read obscene novels; read biographies of great people and books on self-cultivation and morality. Exercise and take suburban trips in your spare time to breathe fresh air. Sleep on your side with your knees bent. Therefore, hygienists say: "Sleep on your side and bend your knees, wake up straight and stretch; this method not only stops seminal emission but is also a wonderful method for nourishing life." If you have an urgent need to urinate in the middle of the night, you should get up and excrete it, otherwise, a full bladder will compress the seminal vesicle and easily cause seminal emission. Bedding should not be too soft but should be moderate. Abstain from irritating substances such as tobacco and alcohol, and then take the seminal emission medicine "Nai Er Si Seminal Emission Tablets" to stop seminal emission. If you also take the male "Bu Ti Kang," a genuine male animal testicular essence preparation invented by Dr. Mei Lun, a German endocrine expert, the effect will be even better. This has long been proven clinically.

### US Increases Aircraft Production, Aiding Democratic Nations to Expand Air Force, Roosevelt's Remarks Concealing from People's Eyes, German Newspaper Says White House Mysterious and Elusive

(Washington) Today, as the Senate leader seeks to support President Roosevelt's foreign policy, people here have received reports that American aircraft manufacturers may supply 1,350 military aircraft to Britain and France within a few months. As Roosevelt and isolationist senators are about to fight each other over the secret of selling aircraft to Britain and France, the British Air Ministry has added 250 Lockheed reconnaissance aircraft and 400 North American training aircraft to its purchase. The French Aviation Association has also authorized negotiations to purchase 700 American fighter jets. At the same time, Senate Democratic Leader Barkley announced that he would convene the Senate Guidance and Policy Committee next week to discuss the debate on foreign policy. The House Military Affairs Committee is drafting a plan to limit the annual increase of new aircraft to 1,000 until a new proposal to increase it to 6,000. Members of the committee said that this gradual increase can also allow American aircraft factories to follow the technological development of the aircraft manufacturing industry. Democratic Senator Le An today defended the government's policy of selling military aircraft to Britain and France. He said that the large-scale purchase of American aircraft by European democratic countries can help American aircraft factories prepare for mass production, which is necessary for Roosevelt's defense program. He said, "We are not yet prepared for war. For example, Germany manufactures 1,200 aircraft per month with eight-hour shifts. We can manufacture 3,600 aircraft per month with a 24-hour work plan." (American Associated Press, 4th)

(Paris) The French "Listener Weekly" yesterday published detailed and accurate figures on France's purchase of aircraft from the United States in its publication. It is said that the American aircraft purchased include the following three types: 200 "Curtiss" destroyers with a flight speed of 450 kilometers per hour; 200 "North American" reconnaissance aircraft; 450 super "Douglas" aircraft with a maximum speed of 580 kilometers per hour. It is heard that the shipment will arrive in France at the beginning of this year. (Haitong Telegraph, 5th)

(Washington) After British Air Minister Sir Wood formally announced that the country had increased its order for aircraft from American factories from 400 to 650, Lieutenant Colonel Johnson, Under Secretary of the Army, recently made a statement to the press, explaining that these aircraft are not the latest types made in the United States. "Anyone can purchase the aircraft that Britain has increased in the American market," he said. Others responsible said that the British authorities believed that the quality of the destroyers they manufactured was better than those made in the United States, and they were not interested in American destroyers. (Havas Telegraph, 4th)

(Berlin) President Roosevelt's admission that he had told the Senate Military Affairs Committee that the American border was now behind France. A German newspaper doubted the truthfulness of this denial. A newspaper said that the US president's statement was not an admission but was intended to conceal it from the American people. President Roosevelt is temporarily retreating now, but he will never change his policy or abandon his views. An official article satirized the US president's admission, saying that this only reminded people of the mysterious and elusive spokesman in the White House during President Coolidge's tenure. (Reuters, 5th)

(Rome) American newspapers revealed that President Roosevelt estimated that democratic countries and dictatorial countries would inevitably have a war. After three days, Roosevelt admitted it. Italian evening newspapers unanimously believed that the admission was too late. Some even said that Roosevelt was afraid of the anger of American public opinion and had to eat his words to appease public anger. Others used dangerous words to intimidate Roosevelt, saying that Roosevelt's alarmist talk would provoke dictatorial countries to take self-defense actions. (Haitong Telegraph, 5th)

### US Munitions Shipped to China and Japan

(Washington) Regarding the US government's permission to ship scrap iron to Japan, Senator Capel, a Republican from Cosses State, yesterday sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull expressing his opposition. Secretary of State Hull recently replied with a letter stating that since July 1, 1937, American merchants had applied to the State Department for export permits to ship munitions to China, totaling US$14,357,277, while those shipped to Japan totaled only US$10,922,693. (Havas Telegraph, 5th)

### Dutch Oil King Passed Away the Day Before Yesterday

Lifelong Hard Work and Labor, the Secret to His Success

Saint Moritz. Sir Deterding, the Dutch "Oil King," passed away here today at the age of 72. According to reports, the knight came from a poor background and lost his mother at the age of six. At the age of sixteen, he applied to the famous Amsterdamsche Bank in Amsterdam and was accepted, becoming the bank's youngest employee. After serving for six years, he felt that the opportunity for promotion was very slim, so he went to the Dutch East Indies to seek development, where he obtained a position at the Netherlands Trading Society. He then went east to Delhi to work as a bookkeeper for the branch of the society. The duties were heavy, but he was able to organize them well, and he was appreciated by the manager for eight years. In 1896, he recommended himself to the Royal Dutch Oil Company, and within just one year, he was promoted to assistant manager. In 1901, he was promoted to any manager position, and one year later, he leaped to become the general manager of the world's largest company. The knight then organized the Anglo-Dutch Oil Industry Federation, so that 40,000 people worked under him, including more than 6,000 in Britain. In 1920, he was awarded the title of knight for his contributions to industry. In 1928, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering from Delft University. In 1933, he publicly advocated that the Netherlands abandon the gold standard, which greatly surprised the Dutch financial community. The knight's fame was due to his superior talent and hard work, which was also an important factor. The knight liked sports. When he lived here, he often played water skiing with his youngest daughter. On that day, physical exercise was of great help to hard work and contemplation. (Reuters, 4th)

### Two New US Destroyers Launched

### The Japanese Army in Luhe Besieged in an Isolated City, the Chinese Army Wins a Fierce Battle in Suqian, Japanese Casualties Exceed Two Thousand, Defenses Consolidated in the Huaihai Area

Xuzhou Correspondence: After the Japanese army invaded Suining and Suqian, one force occupied Shunheji by the Bo River, attempting to advance east towards Shuyang and open up the Haizheng Highway. Another force, along the west bank of the Grand Canal, seized Buzi Ji and Yanghe, attempting to disrupt the heartland of northern Jiangsu. Fortunately, the Chinese army fought bravely, and Heaven blessed Huaihai. In the battle to take Suqian, 98 Japanese automobiles were destroyed, and Japanese casualties exceeded 2,000. Good news from Yanghe and Buzi Ji arrived frequently, with countless enemy captured. The Xuzhou Japanese army suffered heavy losses, their morale shattered, and they dared not act recklessly again. Therefore, they ordered the Japanese army in Yangzhou and Pukou to attack Luhe, which was isolated in the northwest. After fierce resistance from the Chinese army, they suffered heavy casualties. At the end of their strength, they were helpless, and could only be besieged in an isolated city. Having exhausted their resources and facing a dead end, the Japanese army had no other choice but to hire bandits to try to achieve their aims. Their exhaustion and decline can be imagined. The Xuzhou Japanese army, after searching high and low for bandits and providing them with supplies and weapons, planned to advance eastward along the damaged Longhai Railway in three routes: south, central, and north. The central and northern routes made no progress due to the tight Chinese army deployments. Only the southern route took the opportunity to infiltrate Yaowan, Suqian. The Japanese army, believing they had an opportunity, urgently mobilized all their remaining forces and concentrated them in Suqian, attacking Zhuojia Wei, Buzi Ji, and Jin Suo Zhen in three directions, hoping to revive their fortunes and reverse the decline. However, before the day was over, in the battle of Zhuojia Wei, nine out of ten Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. In the battle of Buzi Ji, the Japanese army was ambushed by guerrillas during their retreat, and almost all were killed or wounded. In the battle of Jin Suo, more than 200 Japanese and puppet soldiers were captured, and more than 280 rifles were seized. At the end of last month, the Chinese army defeated them and pursued them in victory, successively recovering Jin Suo Zhen, Buzi Ji, and Jietou Ji. They then attacked Yaowan, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers and wounding even more, capturing more than 180 alive, and seizing countless military supplies. Yaowan was also recovered. The Chinese army, having repeatedly captured important towns, had their morale boosted a hundredfold. This major victory in Suqian and Si County is the most significant battle since the fall of Xuzhou, demonstrating the courage of the Chinese army. The Japanese army's attempt to assist Suqian was completely defeated, and their plot to use bandits to create chaos was also foiled. However, the bandits and puppet troops north of the Longhai Railway still need to be severely suppressed. The remaining enemy troops in Suqian and Suining are still putting up a last-ditch resistance. The Chinese army, not complacent in victory or discouraged by defeat, is steadily and surely accumulating small victories to achieve a major victory, with the heroic and firm determination to defend the country and comfort the great hope of the people of northern Jiangsu.

### Puppet Governors of Jiangsu Province Perform a Bizarre Spring Welcoming Play

Suzhou Correspondence: In the feudal era, during the Lichun Festival in the lunar calendar, local officials welcomed spring in the eastern suburbs. This system was abolished with the founding of the Republic of China. Only when Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor in the fourth year of the Republic ordered the country to hold a spring greeting ceremony. Unexpectedly, this strange phenomenon has reappeared today. Chen Zemin, the puppet governor of Jiangsu Province, under the pretext of restoring the old ways, ordered the puppet counties and districts to resume the spring greeting ceremony yesterday (the Lichun Festival). An altar was set up before the god of agriculture and a spring ox, with offerings such as incense, candles, fruits, and wine. A master of ceremonies and several attendants were present. The puppet governor led the puppet officials, large and small, to the eastern suburbs. When Lichun arrived, the master of ceremonies announced the ceremony. The puppet governor led the way, and the puppet officials followed in order. Then, the god of agriculture and the spring ox were carried in front with drums and music, and the puppet officials followed to welcome them into the city and placed them in the hall of the puppet government. The puppet officials stood around with colored sticks, and the musicians beat drums, striking the spring ox three times before retreating. The people of each county sneered at this bizarre play.

### Punan National Salvation Army Straightens Out Discipline and Organizes Patrol Teams

Punan Correspondence: Ding Xisan, commander of the Eighth Detachment of the Punan Loyalty and National Salvation Army and concurrently commander of the Joint Defense, discovered that his troops were taking advantage of combat opportunities to harass the local population. Some bad elements were even engaging in extortion and blackmail. Therefore, he organized a patrol team to conduct thorough investigations. Those with more serious offenses were immediately executed by firing squad. In recent days, in Ruan Xiang, Hu Jia Qiao, Cao Jing, and other unit headquarters, many people have been found and severely punished. Two battalion commanders were also involved in a case of robbery and murder of the victim. Commander Ding personally interrogated them and executed them on the spot, greatly pleasing the people. The detachment has more than 4,000 soldiers. Some of them are stationed in Maqiao, Tongqiao in the Shanghai County area of ​​northern Pudong, and the Shanghai Middle School area. Ding disguised himself and went to give a speech the other day. He paid particular attention to the discipline of each unit headquarters and issued creeds to be followed. At the same time, Ding mobilized the three major battalions there and attacked the Japanese army base in Shanghai Middle School from Tongqiao. A fierce battle ensued. The Japanese army used the school building as cover. The Chinese troops then charged from the rear with hand grenades. When they approached the school building, they used fire. The Japanese army was attacked from both sides and suffered heavy losses.

### Dark and Bleak Jiaxing: Heavy Taxes and Forced Conscription, People Scattered

Jiaxing Correspondence: Since the establishment of the puppet government in Jiaxing, the tyranny it has imposed has caused the people to suffer deeply. The recent situation is reported below:

Implementing Prostitution: The puppet government believes that the policy of poisoning the minds of the youth is not enough to erode their ambitions, so it has formulated a plan to implement public prostitution. This will not only increase revenue but also ingratiate itself with the Japanese. Therefore, it resolutely implemented it on the first day of the month. The general methods for implementing public prostitution are as follows: all brothels with prostitutes must register with the puppet police station and obtain a license. Once registered, brothels must pay monthly donations in four grades: A, B, C, and D. Grade A pays ten yuan per month, Grade B pays eight yuan, Grade C pays five yuan, and Grade D pays two yuan. In addition, each brothel is required to send a prostitute to a specific brothel every day for the Japanese to rape, etc.

Forced Collection of Land Taxes: The puppet government has been collecting land taxes for three months, but very few people have paid according to the puppet regulations. Although drums have been beaten to urge payment, the people are unwilling to pay taxes, resulting in little effect. Recently, as the end of the lunar year approaches, various outstanding debts need to be settled. Therefore, the puppet government has hired local thugs and ruffians to station themselves at key checkpoints, waiting for wealthy households. If they are encountered, regardless of gender, age, or status, they will be detained and sent to the specially made detention center of the puppet government to force payment. As of when this reporter left Hecheng, it was reported that more than 200 men and women had been detained, most of whom were from middle-class families. Among them, a Mr. Wu, who had just returned to He from Shanghai, was planning to borrow some money from tenant farmers in the countryside due to living difficulties. However, as soon as he got off the bus, he was arrested and transferred to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters for detention on the grounds of secretly hiding weapons. Mr. Wu's relatives then managed to secure his release for a bribe of 1,000 yuan and ordered him to pay the land taxes before he was allowed to leave He.

Forcing Pawnshops to Open: The puppet government, in order to falsely promote the market, requires each pawnshop to restore its business, but each pawnshop said that all of the items it had possessed had been stolen by other people who are directing the theft of everything. It is not possible to go back to business. However, the puppet government ignored everything and forced the pawnshops to resume business within a time limit. If they dare to refuse, the puppet government will confiscate the property of each pawnshop. According to the leader of the pawn industry, regarding the issue of resuming business, they are unwilling to do so until the Japanese troops withdraw. If the puppet government wants to confiscate the stolen items, they will let it happen. It is also reported that the puppet government has decided that if the pawnshops continue to refuse, the puppet government will raise funds to open its own pawnshops and decide to specialize in pawning jewelry and valuable leather clothing at low prices and high interest rates.

Enticing Conscription: The Japanese military in this area ordered the puppet government to conduct a census last year and start conscription, causing the youth in the area to flee to the countryside to temporarily avoid it or join the guerrilla forces. Therefore, the conscription efforts could not be implemented. However, recently, Inatsune Minoru, the chief of the Japanese Comfort Corps, after receiving instructions from the commander of Central China to conscript 100,000 conscripts in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, consulted with Shen Hanqing, the puppet governor. They decided to entice the youth in the area to join under the name of organizing a puppet self-defense corps, and then have the Japanese army transfer them to other places for unit training. It is reported that this measure will be implemented at the beginning of next month.

### Zhejiang Provincial Party Department Promotes Culture in the War Zone

Jinhua Correspondence: In order to promote cultural work in the guerrilla areas, the persons in charge of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department and the Zhejiang Provincial Wartime Education and Culture Affairs Committee specially sent Wu Yifei, the chief of the Propaganda Section of the Provincial Party Department, to western Zhejiang to plan. Wu crossed the river a month ago and went to Jiaxing, Pinghu, Haiyan, Haining and other four counties to plan cultural work and establish a cultural network. Under the Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Committee of Jiaxing and Haining counties, wartime education and cultural affairs committees were established. In addition, in the places he visited, he gathered youths with higher levels of local knowledge and organized cultural groups. Their task was, on the one hand, to distribute various books and newspapers imported from the rear, and on the other hand, to collect cultural information, such as Japanese atrocities, the ugly behavior of traitors, and the heroic stories of the military and civilians fighting against Japan, and supply it to the rear. Wu has completed his work in western Zhejiang and returned to the province a few days ago to report on the truth of western Zhejiang and the progress of the work, and has drafted a plan for promoting cultural work in the guerrilla war zone in the future, and is preparing to promote it jointly by both the department and the committee in the short term.

### "Peace Bell" Glittering with Jewels, Presented to the New York World's Fair by the Japanese Pearl King

New York: According to news received here, Mikimoto, the Japanese cultured pearl magnate, will present his so-called "Peace Bell" to the New York World's Fair. The bell is 17 inches high and is inlaid with 15,000 cultured pearls, worth an estimated $85,000. (Reuter, 5th)

Economic Supplement

### The Japanese Plunder of Central China's Economy in Full View

— Gu Xiaohui

The Japanese are now actively engaged in economic aggression within the occupied areas of Central China. They are organizing the so-called "Central China Revitalization Company," targeting "one company per industry" to establish various subsidiaries. These subsidiaries aim to monopolize all aspects of Central China's economy, including agriculture, production expansion, industry, transportation, and electricity. Their goal is to seize the entire economic power within the war zone in their dealings with China; to exclude international interests in China; and for themselves, to exploit the people's economy and extend it to China. In short, they aim to extract the economy of the occupied areas to compensate for Japan's financial deficiencies, to pursue their long-term war against China, and to completely shift the support of the Japanese army in China onto the Chinese people. This can be seen in the recent remarks made by Itagaki in response to parliamentarians.

I will now describe the methods of economic aggression used by the Japanese in Central China, the organization of various aggressive agencies, and the state of various industries in Central China under occupation. This is based on my own investigations as a reporter and records from Chinese, English, and Japanese newspapers. I have written this piece to allow everyone to see the full picture of Japan's economic aggression in Central China, to make our people aware of this forceful and domineering behavior, and to show that as long as we do not yield, no matter what they do, there will eventually be a day when we recover our lost possessions.

1. The So-Called "Central China Revitalization Company" (?)

In the Northeast, we know that Japan had a so-called "South Manchuria Railway Company" (Mantetsu), which the Japanese themselves called the vanguard of their invasion of the mainland. After 1918, within a few years, all sorts of economic rights outside the customs had fallen into its hands. After August 13th, Japan adopted the same policy, and on November 7th of last year, it established two new companies. One was the so-called "North China Development Company" for North China, and the other was the so-called "Central China Revitalization Company" for Central China. These two organizations, like Mantetsu, are "national policy companies" recognized by the Japanese government. This article will focus solely on the "Central China Revitalization Company."

The "Central China Revitalization Company" was established based on a resolution passed by the 73rd Japanese Diet on April 28th of last year. After its establishment in Tokyo on November 7th of last year, the head office was said to be located in Shanghai (but this has not yet materialized). The company's capital is 100 million Japanese yen, half of which is contributed by the Japanese government and half by the private sector. Its first paid-in capital was 31,382,344 yen, divided as follows:

Japanese Government -- 18,882,344 yen

In-Kind Contribution -- 7,640,000 yen

Cash -- 11,242,344 yen

Private Shares -- 12,500,000 yen

But it is pitiful to say that this private capital was raised over a long period of four months, divided into 100,000 shares, with as many as 9,770 shareholders participating, and the money raised was only a little over 12 million.

In addition to many subsidiaries, the company's organization is divided into three sections and one office, as follows:

Shanghai Head Office

Subsidiaries General Affairs Section Business Section Business Investigation Section Tokyo Branch Office

The key responsible person, the president, is appointed by the Japanese government and is Kodama Kenji. This old man was the Japanese chairman of the so-called Sino-Japanese Trade Association before the war. We should all remember how he came to Shanghai a few years ago, toasting and singing about Sino-Japanese economic cooperation at the International Hotel! Now the fox's tail is showing. It turns out that so-called "cooperation" is this kind of cooperation. Anyone who is still dreaming of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation should wake up. Now let us list the important responsible persons of this company:

President Kodama Kenji (former General Manager of Yokohama Specie Bank)

Vice President Hirasawa Yō (former Vice Minister of Communications)

Director Kanai Kiyoshi (former South Manchuria Railway Company Specialist)

Sonoda Saburō (former Foreign Exchange Section of Yokohama Specie Bank)

Aburatani Kyō (former Director of the Sino-Japanese Industrial Association)

As mentioned above, the establishment of this company is actually a general mechanism for exploiting Japanese private capital and representing the Japanese government's economic aggression against China, with its subsidiaries implementing the aggression. The establishment of subsidiaries follows the principle of "one company per industry." No matter what the industry, it is controlled by the company in that industry. The aim is to control the entire industrial and commercial hub of Central China, exclude European and American interests in China, and turn China into its economic dependency, like an ancient serf, forever unable to enter the gateway of modern industry.

Details about the subsidiaries' control of various industries will be written later. Now let's talk about the activities of Kodama Kenji, the mastermind of the company.

After the establishment of the "Central China Revitalization Company," Kodama Kenji gave an interview to a Reuters reporter in Tokyo, wanting to attract British and American investment in its controlled areas. Therefore, I recognize control and monopoly. First, Kodama said, "The company is not controlled by the army and is purely commercial in nature." This is all a lie. It is clearly one of Japan's "national policy companies" towards China. Kodama himself was appointed by the Japanese government. According to Tokyo's own account, the Japanese government has the power to supervise the company, the power to cancel the company's resolutions, the power to appoint and dismiss the company's responsible persons, and the power to issue various necessary orders for national defense or other necessities. This is enough to show that what Kodama said is all false. In fact, this company is a representative of the Japanese government, and the responsible persons inside are the lackeys of the warlords. Second, he said, "The company has no intention of monopolizing." This is even more of a lie. Looking at "Mantetsu" in the Northeast, it has now completely excluded all international interests in "Manchukuo." Looking at North China, the control of cotton is nominally by a puppet organization, but in reality, isn't it this so-called "North China Development Company"? Furthermore, in the shipping routes in Shanghai and inland rivers, since the establishment of the Japanese "Inland River Steamship Company," it has been completely monopolized. The "Inland River Steamship Company" is a subsidiary of this company. Foreign shipping companies have even negotiated with the Japanese for permits to navigate the inland rivers, but to no avail. There are many other industries like this. Isn't it enough to prove its control? At the same time, Japanese newspapers invariably acknowledge that the policy will henceforth center on controlling China's industrial and commercial enterprises. Second, Kodama also said, "Shanghai is much more prosperous. Japanese commerce is developing accordingly, and there is no reason why foreign commerce should not expand." This is their attempt to lure Europe and America to invest in Central China and complete their development conspiracy. However, all parties remained indifferent to Kodama's remarks. He left Tokyo to operate in Shanghai in this situation.

Kodama arrived in Shanghai on the Miyazaki Maru on November 26th of last year, accompanied by the company's Vice President Hirazawa and directors. They held so-called Sino-Japanese economic cooperation meetings with the puppets in Hongkou, including:

Strategies for expanding the revitalization company;

Establishment of a Sino-Japanese Bank.

Issuance of counterfeit currency.

Promotion of military scrip.

Other control matters.

On November 30th, he went from Shanghai to Nanjing to discuss cooperation methods with the highest Japanese military commander. He also convened a meeting in Nanjing with the puppet governors of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to discuss their so-called "cooperation" methods, which in reality was just asking a few puppets what things they had that could be plundered! Kodama is said to reside in Shanghai for a long time, but his plan to establish a Sino-Japanese Bank and issue counterfeit currency failed due to the righteous refusal of Chinese and foreign banks. As for the promotion of military scrip, after he arrived in Nanjing, he had already agreed with the Japanese side, and it was implemented on November 30th of last year. That is, issuing new military scrip in the occupied areas to replace bank notes and using worthless paper to buy goods is a policy of plunder.

2. Establishment of Various Control Companies

Regarding the various subsidiaries established by the Japanese to control various industries, many companies had already been established under the "request" of the Japanese army before the "Central China Revitalization Company" was established and before Kodama came to Shanghai. Later, when the "Revitalization Company" was established, the various companies became its subsidiaries. After Kodama came to China, several new ones were established.

To control inland river navigation, the "Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company" was established on July 28th of last year with a capital of 2 million Japanese yen. Of this, 600,000 yen was contributed by the Japanese "Central China Revitalization Company," and 400,000 yen by the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, totaling 1 million yen. The remaining 1 million yen was used to seize Chinese assets, valued at 1 million, as capital. The company uses the name of controlling inland river routes in Central China. It currently has 75 steamships and 70 barges. All important inland river routes in Central China are exclusively licensed to the company.

On July 31st of last year, the "Central China Electric Communication Co., Ltd." was established with a capital of 15 million Japanese yen. Of this, 6 million was contributed by the "Central China Revitalization Company," 2 million by the International Electric Communication Company, 1 million by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation, and 1 million jointly by the Nippon Electric Company, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Furukawa Electric, Fujikura Electric Wire, and Oki Electric. This totals 10 million, and the remaining 5 million is used to seize various original telecommunications equipment and industries in Central China, converted into capital. The company operates Central China's telegraph, telephone, and external wireless communication businesses. All wired and wireless telegraphs and telephones between cities such as Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing, and Hangzhou are controlled and operated. It also plans to expand wireless telecommunications to Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States, and submarine telegraphs to North China. Long-distance telephone lines between Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou, and wireless telephones between Shanghai and Tokyo have been connected.

On June 30th of last year, the "Central China Hydroelectric Power Joint Venture" was established, with 3 million yen contributed by Japan Iron & Steel Engineering Co. And 2.5 million yen jointly contributed by Tsurumi Steel, Ogura Steel, Nakayama Steel Works, and Sino-Japanese Industrial Company. The remaining 10 million is used to seize mineral resources from about 20 iron ore areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, converted into half of the capital.

Its plan is to first steal ore from the Taochong iron ore area between Nanjing and Wuhu, and between Taiping and Tongling. The Taiping iron ore is the target for preliminary mining. The first-year plan is to mine 1 million tons of iron ore. Mining has already begun in Aotushan and Nanshan. The current daily average is 500 tons of iron ore mined. On October 26th of last year, the first ship of 7,000 tons was shipped from Ma'anshan, the second ship of 3,000 tons was shipped on the 31st, and the third ship was shipped in November, all to Japan.

To start long-distance bus services in the occupied areas of Central China, the "Central China Urban Public Automobile Co., Ltd." was established on November 5th of last year. The head office is located in Shanghai, with a capital of 3 million Japanese yen. Of this, 2.5 million was jointly contributed by the Xingzhong Company, Dazhi Automobile Company, and Jiangnan Industrial Company, with half paid in advance. The remaining 500,000 is supplemented by seized Chinese real estate.

The company's business scope covers the seven cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang, specializing in urban public bus services, as well as intercity long-distance buses and truck transportation. Within the Shanghai Suzhou Hebei concessions, it also seizes the exclusive rights granted by the Public Concession authorities to the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, and operates public buses in areas where roads are built across the border. Another company will be established to specifically operate long-distance bus services.

To control the agricultural and industrial production of silkworm eggs, silk, and silk factories in Central China, the "Central China Silk Co., Ltd." was established. The head office is located in Shanghai, established on August 10th of last year, with a capital of 8 million Japanese yen (Japanese sources say 10 million Japanese yen, but either way, it's bragging, so it doesn't matter). Of this, 6 million was contributed by the "Central China Revitalization Company," with half paid in advance, and an estimated 2 million Japanese yen in seized Central China silk factory assets is used to supplement the capital.

The company's objectives:

Operating machine silk reeling business. Operating the production and distribution of silkworm eggs. Operating the silk hand-reeling industry. Buying and selling native silk. Conducting matters related to the above items. At the same time, Wang Zihui, the "responsible person" of the puppet "Renovation Government," sold silk factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Huzhou, Jiaxing, Hai'ning, and Deqing to the Japanese when he went to Japan, and signed the conditions they desired with the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry:

(A) The production of silkworm cocoons in Central China must be increased to the level before the war. The number of silk reeling basins shall be limited to about 10,000. (B) The reeling and distribution of silk cocoons shall be managed by the "Central China Silk Company." (C) Japanese silk factories shall specialize in reeling the superior grades of silk, 20 to 22 denier, and 13 to 15 denier, while Chinese silk factories shall specialize in the coarse silk of 20 to 22 denier. (D) Select special silkworm cocoons for use in North China and Japan. (E) The inspection and control of raw silk exports from North China shall be handled by the "Central China Revitalization Company."

(F) Hand-reeled silk should be encouraged, and efforts should also be made to promote new uses for silkworm cocoons. In the future, another company will be established to manage the production of special dried cocoons. (G) The same policy as in Central China will be adopted for the sericulture industry in Shandong.

On December 28th of last year, the "Central China Gas Co., Ltd." was established. The head office is located in Shanghai with a capital of 3 million yuan. Of this, 2.5 million yuan was contributed by the "Central China Revitalization Company," Shanghai Permanent Properties Company, Hiroshima Gas Co., Ltd., Tokyo Gas Chemical Industry Co., etc., with one-fourth paid in advance, and seized property from [China], converted into 500,000 yuan, to fill the remaining shares. The leading figures of the company: Managing Director is Toyoshima Akemi (former Director of Hiroshima Gas Electric Railway Co., Ltd.), Director Chen Shaowei (Managing Director of Shanghai Permanent Properties Company), Ishikura Kichiji (former Managing Director of Tokyo Gas Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), Supervisor Fei Mingyu.

To control shipping on the Yangtze River, the "Yangtze River Shipping Company" was established on December 10th of last year. The head office is located in Shanghai, and it has not yet started business. The amount of capital is unknown, and it is invested by the "Central China Revitalization Company" and Nisshin Steamship Co., Ltd., Daewoo Steamship Co., etc., and seizes Chinese shipping company wharves along the Yangtze River as capital to monopolize all shipping in the ports of the Yangtze River, and has 16 river vessels, excluding British shipping.

To seize Shanghai real estate, the so-called "Revitalization War Zone," the "Shanghai Permanent Properties Company" was established on September 1st of last year. The head office is located in Shanghai with a capital of 2 million yuan, of which 1 million yuan was contributed by the "Central China Revitalization Company," using public land of the former Shanghai Municipal Government, etc., converted into 1 million yuan, to fill half of the capital. It is said that the company will start from Shanghai, planning to build urban areas, roads, harbors, etc., to transform Shanghai and control the concessions.

To seize fish production along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the "Central China Aquatic Products Co., Ltd." was established on November 6th of last year. The head office is located in Shanghai with a capital of 1.33 million yen, of which 1 million was from the "Central China Revitalization Company," and the remaining 330,000 was from seizing the Shanghai fish market industry, etc., converted to supplement the capital. The company operates wholesale markets for aquatic products and sales businesses, and engages in fishing with fishing boats and nets, as well as cold storage transportation and other businesses.

On July 25th of last year, the "Shanghai Fish Market Association" was established with a capital of 100,000 yuan, and it is one and the same with the "Central China Aquatic Products Co., Ltd." to monopolize the local fish industry.

As for other aspects that have been controlled in Central China but have not yet established agencies, such as railways, the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Suzhou-Jiaxing, and Jiangnan railways are being repaired by engineers sent by the Japanese Military Railway Department, the Japanese Railway Department, and the South Manchuria Railway Company, and will be operated by the "Central China Revitalization Company." Coal mines: plans to mine the Huainan coal mine, Changxing coal mine, etc. The Zhongxing coal has already begun to be shipped to Japan. Wireless broadcasting: the "Greater Shanghai" and "Greater East" have been established, and puppet organizations are planned to control Shanghai Chinese radio stations. For tobacco, there are the Toyo Leaf Tobacco Company, the East Asia Tobacco Company, and the Gong Sheng Tobacco Company, etc., seizing Chinese cigarette factories. In terms of agricultural products, agencies have been established in the interior to control purchases. For example, for cotton, the Japanese Merchants' Association in China and the Chinese traitor organization Citizen's Association jointly established a control agency in Shanghai, and after obtaining a purchase certificate from the Japanese military, they dispatched personnel to establish offices in various counties to control purchases and prohibit "private sales." All flower collection offices established by Chinese merchants in the interior have been forced to withdraw. For example, rice is purchased in Songjiang, Wuxi, Changshu, Suzhou, etc., and shipped for export, totaling no less than several million dan. Shipbuilding: the Japanese Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Corporation seized the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department to repair warships, and occupied the machinery of the Sanbei Hongchang and Hexing factories. The Japanese army occupied the Pudong Laogong Mao and Dinghai Bridge Da Zhonghua factories, and Nisshin occupied the machinery of the Caili Longchang Hengchang Xiang Hongxiang Xing Zhao Shang Nehe five factories. Cement, textiles, flour, etc., have all been seized separately by the Japanese under the instigation of the Japanese army.

3. Links with Japanese Trading Companies

The various subsidiaries mentioned above are direct agencies for plundering China. They are subordinate to the "Central China Revitalization Company," a "national policy company." The "Central China Revitalization Company," representing the Japanese official side, naturally participates in the organization of each subsidiary. The rest are jointly organized by Japanese merchants to plunder Chinese assets for their exploitation. These have already been mentioned above, and for the sake of clarity, a table is provided below:

4. Various Plundered Industries

Before the war, Chinese cotton mills in Central China had 1.38 million spindles and 14,700 looms. Currently, the Japanese have occupied and utilized 600,000 spindles, 5,300 looms, and a total of 37 factories.

Regarding the cement factories that have been seized, according to the Shanghai News Commercial News, of the ten Chinese cement factories in the country, only one remains in Chinese hands. The nine in the Japanese-occupied area have all been seized, including three in North China, two in South China, and four in Central China.

Central China is a sericulture production area, and the Japanese have long coveted it. In the past, when they could not obtain it, they repeatedly sold inferior silkworm eggs to our country in an attempt to harm it. After August 13th, the silk cocoon production areas in the Japanese-occupied areas of Central China, such as Shanghai, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Hai'ning, Deqing, etc., were all occupied. Since the establishment of the so-called "Central China Silk Company," all have been occupied and operated by it. The number of silk machines seized: 3 in Shanghai with 708 machines, 9 in Wuxi with 2,554 machines, 19 in Suzhou with 3,656 machines, and 22 in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Hai'ning, etc. with 4,030 machines. There are more than 50 companies with 10,948 silk machines in total.

At the same time, the "Central China Silk Company" also occupied cocoon factories and silkworm egg production sites. In the occupied areas of Jiangsu Province, there are a total of 214, including 26 in Wuxian, 99 in Wuxi, 1 in Changshu, 2 in Wujiang, 1 in Kunshan, 1 in Taicang, 19 in Jiangyin, 20 in Wujin, 8 in Yixing, 3 in Jintan, 10 in Danyang, 10 in Liyang, 1 in Lishui, 1 in Dantu, 2 in Jurong, 5 in Yangzhong, and 2 in Jiangdu.

Among the flour mills in Central China that have been invaded and started by the Japanese, there are four in the Shanghai urban area, including the Fuxin No. 3 Mill, which have been invaded and operated by the "Japan Flour Milling Company" jointly run by Mitsui and Mitsubishi. There are five in Wuxi: Fuxin, Maoxin, Guangfeng, Guangdong, and Jiufeng. Among them, the Jiufeng mill is operated by the Japanese Yoshida, while the others are mostly operated by the "Japan Flour Milling Company." There is the Yangtze River Flour Mill in Nanjing, which is occupied and operated by the Japanese Sato Koichi.

The cigarette market in the guerrilla areas of Central China is completely controlled by the Japanese. Using military force, it prohibits Chinese cigarette merchants and British cigarette merchants from transporting into the interior, and sells inferior goods that are crudely made with tobacco obtained from the Wan Province and by seizing and occupying the Chinese cigarette factories in the occupied area and starting operations without paying taxes. Thus, this market is completely occupied.

There were more than a dozen paper mills in Nanshi, Pudong, Zhabei, and Yangshupu in Shanghai. Since the Chinese army retreated to the west, most of the factories have been occupied by the Japanese. The Japanese then attempted to lure the authorities of each factory to cooperate with the Japanese and resume operations, but the factory officials, with righteousness, were determined to sacrifice their small selves and unanimously refused. Seeing that the lure did not work, the Japanese occupied all the factory buildings and machinery, preparing to start operations.

In addition, there are still factories that have been seized by the Japanese, as seen in the Shanghai News Commercial News article "A Sad History of Chinese Industry and Commerce" (see the Shanghai News of October 27th of last year), and many factories have sent letters stating that they have not cooperated with the Japanese and that it is purely plunder.

5. A Final Thought

I have finished writing this article with the materials I have now obtained. Of course, we see that the huge people's industry has been plundered, and it is an undeniable loss. We also see the other party's sinister conspiracy within their so-called "Central China Revitalization Company." But we really don't need to be too terrified. We want to see what its capabilities are. And look at the capital of this "Central China Revitalization Company," nominally 100 million yen, but the first phase only collected 31,382,344 yen. Apart from the Japanese government's forced contribution of 18,882,344 yen (and only 11,242,344 yen in cash), the remaining private shares were only 12.5 million yen, and were raised over a long period of four months, divided into 100,000 shares, and raised from 9,770 people. This is a truly genuine fact that proves that their people are not interested in this. Moreover, many of the affairs developed in China are not only not beneficial to their domestic industry, but have also been affected by them. This has already been discovered. Therefore, we must see through this point, and hope that the authorities of our industries will earnestly implement holding the line, gritting our teeth, and sacrificing to the end. We must never be lured or threatened into cooperating with the Japanese puppets. In this way, let's see what the other party can do, and the industries you are currently occupying can be returned to Zhao Wanbi when the final victory comes.

Of course, we have also seen factory owners who upheld righteousness and firmly refused to "cooperate" (here I want to mention one, such as Ba Qingxiang, the factory owner of the Suzhou Dalong Iron Factory and the Sulun Yarn Factory, who was lured by the Japanese without success, and was arrested and threatened, but in the end he still firmly refused and went to the Southwest. This is a representative). But we have also seen many who willingly let themselves be used and cooperate with the other party, such as the silk factories in Wuxi, which are an example. (Here, the reporter also gives an example, that is, a nationally famous Nantong yarn factory actually willingly started operations in cooperation with the Japanese, and the Japanese flag and the five-color flag were flying on its roof. It provides hundreds of thousands to the other party every month. When the author went to visit the truth of the factory, a representative of the factory in Shanghai also acquiesced, saying: The factory is mortgaged to German merchants, so why not move it? Why provide the other party with huge sums of money? The person shook his head and smiled, seemingly indicating: The first point is that the procedures are too difficult, and the second point is because I still want to make a fortune.)

In addition to the above actions, we must also come up with active actions, which is what we hope for from the military and political organizations in the guerrilla areas. We must carry out destructive work, like the mineral production in Shanxi, to make it impossible to mine. Such destructive work does not have to be too great, but we must try to make it impossible to start work and excavation. We must make it so that the other party is not able to do it themselves, and cannot use others, and is also faced with all kinds of difficulties. In this way, let's see what they can do after they have captured it? (The End)

Commercial News

### Finance: Pure Gold Slightly Weaker, Hechi Trading Not Yet Open

Yesterday, the cash Hechi black market was quiet due to the Sunday holiday, with few people gathering. It was rumored that someone offered to sell at 2040 yuan, but buyers only bid 2037-2038 yuan, so no deals were made. Business at money exchange shops was also unusually sluggish. The exchange price for gold jewelry per tael at silver shops remained unchanged. Da Tong Hang, Lao Qingyun, and others still quoted the original price of 207 yuan, while new shops quoted 205 yuan for sales and 199 yuan for purchases. According to a London cable from the 4th, the price of British pure gold suddenly decreased by half a penny per ounce, reaching £7 8s 7½d.

### British and Indian Silver Prices Slightly Higher

According to a London cable from the 4th, purchases by India and speculators, coupled with limited supply, kept the market calm. Large silver bars for both near and far terms rose by 0.0625. According to a New York silver cable, the American silver price remained unchanged. Also, a Bombay silver cable reported that the Indian silver market was calm, with both spot and near/far terms rising by one anna.

### Securities: Si Hai Shares Converted to British Gold, Fearnley & Eger Shares Pay Dividends

The British-owned Si Hai Insurance Company of this city passed a resolution at its extraordinary general meeting on December 27th of last year to convert the original total share capital of 2 million shares, with a face value of 5 taels of silver per share, to a total share capital of 933,323 shares, with a face value of 10 shillings of British gold per share. It was stipulated that 15 old shares denominated in silver could be exchanged for 7 new shares denominated in British gold. To prepare for the exchange process, share transfers were suspended from the 30th of last month to the 4th of this month.

Furthermore, Fearnley & Eger Rubber Limited, managed by Bucknall & Co. of this city, will pay a dividend for this term (November 1, 1937, to the end of October 1938) of 3 fen in national currency per share (face value of 1 yuan in national currency per share).

### Food: Japonica Rice Prices Unanimously Increased

Yesterday, the source of domestic rice saw six boats arriving in Hexia, with only three to four thousand bags of Lunche baozi rice. The market continued to surge. The Rice Merchants Association has already resolved to close for business on the 14th of this month for a major inventory. As a result, shopkeepers on this street have mostly stocked up, and hoarders are also anxious, making the sales market even more active. At the same time, sellers are taking the opportunity to raise prices, creating an extremely tight situation. The market continues to rise, with the price of thick and thin Japonica rice increasing by 10-20 cents. Doyang sharp and But sharp followed suit. Yin Yuan good increased by 10-20 cents, while Bian Yuan, as a popular seasonal item, saw extensive sales, with prices increasing by 20 cents. Rumor has it that prices have already reached as high as 15 yuan.

### Sugar Market: Both Coarse and Refined Sugar Tighten Again

Yesterday, the trend of foreign sugar tightened again. The association's board quoted 24 Dutch cents for coarse white sugar, with spot prices rising by 20 cents to 24.10 yuan. Re-export goods rose another 10 cents, trading at 15.875 yuan before calling for 16 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar for delivery at the wharf rose by 20 cents, quoted at 23.40 yuan, with over a hundred bags traded. The price of goods from our godown was 23.50 yuan, with other prices following suit. Several dozen bags of old Chen Chaoqing domestic sugar were offered at a price of 13.20 yuan.

### Medicinal Materials: Job's Tears Market Weak

Job's tears (also known as rice kernels) enjoyed brisk sales in the autumn and winter of last year, reaching a peak price of 38 yuan. Subsequently, the supply gradually increased, and merchants' inventories filled up daily, leading to a sluggish market with only sporadic transactions, falling by varying amounts of 2-3 yuan. Currently, a Hong Kong group is considering buying, contacting merchants for prices as low as 31-32 yuan, but sellers are still trying to hold on, resulting in a standoff. Large quantities might be released at 33-34 yuan.

### Hardware: Hard Lead Wire Soars

Despite being the end of the year, hardware trading remains exceptionally active. Customers from Tianjin and Yantai are actively buying, and demand from Southeast Asia is also strong. Transactions on this street remain smooth, with the market offering 2-3 thousand dan of various goods. Among them, new lead wire, this factory's original nails, English steel plates, company iron, blue lead iron, new foreign ingots, triangular iron, white lead wire, and chimney iron are all being offered. Due to the tight exchange rate, prices have seen little change. However, hard lead wire, which has been weak for a long time, suddenly changed its appearance yesterday. Due to the market's supply not meeting demand, prices soared. Currently, number 12 is selling for 18 yuan per dan, up 1 yuan from the previous day. Number 12 is selling for 17.75 yuan, also up 25 cents. Numbers 14 and 15 are both selling for 18.25 yuan, an increase of 50 cents from the previous market. Although other varieties are being traded, the selling prices show little change. Investigations reveal that the spot supply of hard lead wire on the market is extremely limited, so holders are very firm in their thinking and unwilling to easily release their goods at a lower price in the future.

### North-South Goods: Qingdao Vermicelli Prices Increase

Due to brisk sales, vermicelli has tightened again, causing Qingdao vermicelli prices to increase. Yesterday, the top Zhuang offered up to 49 yuan. Other goods from Longkou and Jiangbei saw little change.

### Silk and Tea: Foreign Green Tea Trade Continues Smoothly

Since the tea factories in this city started producing large quantities of rough tea for the market last week, foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson, Ewo, Gibb Livingston, and Tungfoo have successively started trading in Precious Eyebrow, Pearl Tea, Needle Eyebrow, and other varieties. No less than 700 boxes have been traded, all of which are top-grade Zhuang goods, and prices are quite firm. The transaction volume for last week is specially recorded below: Jardine Matheson bought a total of 324 boxes of ordinary Precious Eyebrow under the Extreme Peak brand, priced from 82 yuan to 108 yuan. Ewo bought 217 boxes of Cloud Mist Peak Precious Eyebrow, priced from 92 yuan to 120 yuan. Gibb Livingston bought 33 boxes of Rare Precious Eyebrow, priced at 105 yuan, and also bought 26 boxes of First Grade Fragrance Needle Eyebrow, priced at 75 yuan.

Tungfoo and Wing Fat jointly bought 20 boxes of Wing Fang Precious Eyebrow, priced at 140 yuan, and also 16 boxes of Auspicious Shrimp Eye, priced at 85 yuan. The market continues to be smooth.

### Thirteen Types of Native Products Will Not Be Shipped to Shanghai Starting This Year; Foreign Sales Will Be Under the Control of the Trade Commission; Funds Will Be Allocated for Purchase and Centralized Export from Hong Kong and Kunming

After the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance adjusted foreign trade, the overall trade deficit decreased and the export of native products increased. Starting this year, the implementation of control over 13 types of native products such as tung oil and tea will absolutely prohibit their transportation to Shanghai, and will be completely concentrated for export from Hong Kong and Kunming. Market prices will also be adjusted and native products will be purchased as much as possible. Details are recorded as follows:

Control of Foreign Trade in Native Products

The native products under the control of the Trade Commission are 13 categories including tung oil, pig bristles, tea, ore, medicinal materials, silk, sausage casings, hides, duck feathers, gourd seeds, wool, ramie, and cowhide. The export of the above native products must be settled in foreign exchange with the China and Communications Banks in accordance with the law, and they are specially allowed to be exported completely duty-free and absolutely prohibited from being re-exported to the occupied areas. Shanghai is designated as one of the occupied areas, so since New Year's Day this year, the 13 types of native products have stopped being transported to Shanghai.

Adjust Market Prices and Government Purchases

The Trade Commission has established offices in Zhejiang, Sichuan, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and other provinces to make every effort to adjust the market prices of native products in order to maintain domestic production. Based on foreign market prices, the purchase prices of goods produced in the place of origin and their distribution market are determined. The committee will entrust the Central Trust Bureau, China Tea Company, China Vegetable Oil Company, and Fu Hua Company to purchase as much as possible. Merchants who wish to purchase native products must contact the committee in advance and follow the methods stipulated by the committee.

Native Product Exports Concentrated in Hong Kong and Kunming

The export of 13 types of native products will henceforth be concentrated in Hong Kong and Kunming. The Trade Commission will then load them onto ships and transport them to various countries. Regarding the purchase of native products, the Ministry of Finance has allocated 80 million yuan in national currency to the Trade Commission as a fund for purchasing native products. In addition, 10 million yuan in national currency has been allocated to the Central Trust Bureau to serve as a war risk fund when handling the transportation of native products. The insurance premiums for native products exported with the Trade Commission's certification are specially allowed to be recorded on account. If the goods are sold at a loss after the goods are sold, the insurance premiums will be waived and paid by the government.

Various Industries Contact and Operate Native Products

After the ban on tung oil, tea, etc. being transported to Shanghai, the Shanghai Foreign Tea Merchants Association has established offices in Hong Kong, Wenzhou, and Ningbo to contact the Trade Commission and purchase Zhejiang East Pingshui and Anhui Luzhuang green tea. Some of the association's member tea houses have moved to Hong Kong for transactions. As for the foreign firms that purchase Chinese tea, they have also sent personnel to Hong Kong to purchase and directly load them onto ships for transportation to various countries. Therefore, the transaction of Chinese tea will be completely transferred to Hong Kong in the future. As for the trade in tung oil, medicinal materials, and leather, etc., it has also successively moved to Hong Kong and Kunming.

Increase in Exports of Major Native Products

Last year's exports of native products: tung oil valued at 39.23 million yuan in national currency; tea valued at 14.29 million yuan in national currency; pig bristles valued at 28.06 million yuan in national currency; ore valued at 100.657 million yuan in national currency; medicinal materials valued at 4.98 million yuan in national currency; wool valued at 10.14 million yuan in national currency; ramie valued at 4.51 million yuan in national currency; silk valued at 37.51 million yuan in national currency; hides valued at 1.942 million yuan in national currency; duck feathers valued at 4.61 million yuan in national currency; sausage casings valued at 7.7 million yuan in national currency.

### After the Hungarian Merchant Vessel Aida Was Detained, the Hungarian Government Protested to Japan; It Was Intercepted After Loading Cargo in Shanghai and Sailing to Wenzhou; It Has Now Been Detained in Xiamen for Monitoring

The ADA, a gasoline ship of the Hungarian firm Komor & Co., with a cargo capacity of 198 tons, was chartered by Wah Tai Co. to transport goods for customers. It once sailed between Shanghai and Changyinsha. Later, it changed its route to Shanghai-Wenzhou. On the 20th of last month, the gasoline ship loaded 1,000 empty diesel drums, 20 tons of coal, 20 tons of diesel, a small drilling machine, 20 iron sheets, and 40 passengers for customers and sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou. Suddenly, on the 22nd, it was detained by the Japanese on the Wenzhou sea. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the company yesterday that the shipowner, Norwegian Stein, had entrusted a Portuguese ship to cable Shanghai twice to report to the company. The first cable reported the detention situation, and the second requested reporting to the Hungarian government for negotiations. Currently, the Aida has been detained by the Japanese in Xiamen and is being monitored by the Japanese Navy in Xiamen. The company has now reported the detention incident to the Hungarian government. It is reported that the Hungarian government has lodged a protest with the Japanese side based on the report, demanding its prompt release.

### The Government Strives to Regulate Wartime Food Prices, Standardizing Market Prices, Exempting Re-export Taxes, and Circulating Domestic Food; Agricultural Warehouses Will Be Established in Various Provinces and Cities to Store Pledged Reserves for Prevention

In order to regulate the surplus and deficiency of wartime food, standardize market prices, and promote agricultural warehouses, the Ministry of Economic Affairs promulgated the "Food Regulation Measures" and then promulgated the "Outline of Measures for Food Management in War Zones," making every effort to restrict the import of foreign rice and wheat and prohibit the export or re-export of grain and wheat to the occupied areas. At the same time, various provinces were ordered to increase food production and carry out grain storage. Details are recorded as follows:

Establish Agricultural Warehouses to Store and Pledge Food

The Agricultural Bank is actively organizing self-operated agricultural warehouses in important locations in the southwest and northwest provinces to operate food storage, pledge, and transportation and sales businesses. At the same time, the China Farmers Bank and provincial banks in various provinces have successively planned to establish new-style agricultural warehouses to handle food storage and pledge. In addition to carrying out grain storage in accordance with the "Outline of Measures for Local Warehouse Construction and Grain Storage" promulgated by the Ministry of Interior, the provincial governments also encouraged various people's organizations to establish simple agricultural warehouses to operate warehousing and lending businesses. Now, agricultural warehouses have been established in various provinces and are closely linked to each other for mutual regulation.

Make Every Effort to Restrict the Import of Foreign Rice

In order to adjust foreign trade and reduce trade deficits, the government has made every effort to restrict the import of foreign rice. If provinces want to purchase foreign rice and wheat, they must obtain prior approval from the Executive Yuan. As a result, the import volume of foreign rice and wheat has sharply decreased since June of last year. However, the import of miscellaneous grains still ranked first among imported foreign goods throughout the year, valued at customs gold 56,934,215, equivalent to 130,004,931 yuan in national currency. Among them, foreign rice was 56.39 million yuan and wheat flour was 52.98 million yuan.

Food Management Measures in War Zones

The Ministry of Economic Affairs has promulgated the "Outline of Management Measures for Food in War Zones," which will be handled by the competent authorities. Adequate military and civilian food reserves are stored in important national defense areas near the war zone. In addition to the military food quantity being stipulated and handled by the Military Affairs Commission, the civilian food should be determined by the local governments according to the population ratio and the quantity of food required for several months, and they are responsible for storing the reserves and strictly prohibit unscrupulous merchants from speculating and manipulating the market. The highest and lowest prices of food should be carefully stipulated in light of the actual situation.

Exempt Re-export Taxes and Circulate Domestically

After the surplus of food in one place should be supplied to the insufficient places as much as possible, the Ministry of Finance exempted the re-export tax on miscellaneous grains and products, such as rice bran, buckwheat, wheat flour, sorghum, corn, millet, rice noodles, bean cake, and wheat, so as to ensure the circulation of food in the country. However, the export and re-export of food to the occupied areas is absolutely prohibited. At the same time, the customs strictly guard against private exports. Therefore, last year's exports of miscellaneous grains and their products were only valued at 4,850,955 yuan in national currency.

Strictly Prevent Private Export of Food

Japanese merchants and North China merchants colluded with food merchants to purchase food from the guerrilla areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang and transport it to Shanghai, then transship it to Japanese ships to transport it north. It is estimated that it has exceeded one million shi, resulting in a gradual thinning of reserves in the guerrilla areas, affecting the civilian food in the war zone. Our government has ordered the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to strictly prevent unscrupulous merchants from privately exporting food. Now, the guerrillas in the guerrilla areas have been ordered to severely punish and never pardon those who assist Japan in privately exporting food. Any legitimate merchants who want to purchase food from the guerrilla areas must have supporting documents.

### Intensify the Elimination of British and American Rights and Interests; Japan Sends Tsuda to Shanghai; Organize the "East Asia Institute Central China Liaison Branch" to Control Central China's Economic and Cultural Exclusion and Annihilate China

According to informed sources, Japan is planning to actively eliminate the rights and interests of Britain, the United States, and France in China and is plotting to control the economic and cultural undertakings in Central China. The implementation will now be intensified. Tokyo has recently sent Major General Tsuda to Shanghai to organize the so-called "East Asia Institute Central China Liaison Branch," an organization to destroy China and exclude foreigners.

### The Tiger Car Modified Wheel Case is Resolved Amicably; Two Chinese Directors Negotiated with the Authorities; The Impounded Cars are Expected to be Released Today

The case of the Tiger cars of the Shanghai market Tiger Car Mutual Aid Association being impounded by various police stations for being unable to modify their wheels has been mediated by the two Chinese directors Jiang and Xi. Philippe has instructed the two police and vehicle affairs directors, together with Deputy General Manager He and the two Chinese directors Jiang and Xi, to discuss and agree on an amicable solution. The deadline for modifying the vehicles will be extended to July 1st of this year, and the association will be responsible for persuading the members to complete the modifications. Regarding the release of the impounded cars, as yesterday was Sunday, it is expected to be released today.

### The British Ambassador's Wife Donates Generously; She Donates a Huge Sum of Money to Help Our Distressed Compatriots

Lady Kerr, the wife of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Kerr Clark Kerr, expressed great sympathy for our distressed compatriots and has repeatedly donated funds to cover relief expenses. Recently, she donated another 500 yuan in legal tender and sent it to the Shanghai Charity Organization Joint Committee to assist the Chinese Laborers' Shelter. The committee has replied with a letter of thanks.

### The Industry Group of the Refugee Relief Association Issues a Declaration; The Committee is Elected to Jointly Promote Progress

Yesterday, the industry associations in this city discussed the organization of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Industry Group Fundraising Committee at the New Licha Tea House. A committee was elected to actively promote progress, and it was decided not to collect donations on behalf of others, but only to be responsible for supervising and promoting fundraising. The details are recorded as follows:

The Elected Committee: Xu Jiying, Yu Zuoting, Jin Runxiang, Zhu Wenqi, Ma Shaoquan, Zheng Zenan, Sun Qiuping, Zhang Lianfang, Wang Yuanzhang, Chen Wenming, Li Wenjie, Chen Ziyi, Lu Wenshao, Gan Tinghui, Chen Panjun, Liu Minzhai, Yang Weiyin, Ding Fangyuan, Tu Kaizheng, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Zhou Bangjun, Shen Weiting, Zhang Wenkui, Yu Langxi, Xu Wenzhao, Ge Weian, Feng Qingan, Hong Wenjiang, Cheng Kefan, Wu Xingcha, and others were elected as committee members and have been reported to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association for record.

The Declaration: The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's articles of association stipulate that the fundraising of refugee funds should be carried out in five groups as specified in Article 2: 1. Industry Group, 2. Citizen Group, 3. Freelance Professional Group, 4. Wealthy Group, 5. Hometown Group. Now, the Citizen Group and the Hometown Group have successively established fundraising committees and worked hard to promote progress, achieving excellent results. Shanghai is known for its prosperous commerce, but the Industry Group Fundraising Committee has been slow to organize, leading to criticism for falling behind. Although since the establishment of the Refugee Relief Association, the various industries have been very active in drawing salaries, deducting commissions from business, paying monthly donations, and making one-time donations, they have been acting independently and lacking the promotion of a unified organization. In order to fulfill the responsibility of Shanghai people to relieve Shanghai refugees, the various industries have mutually supervised and promoted the establishment of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Industry Group Fundraising Committee, so that those who have already donated can seek to be universal and lasting, and those who have not yet organized can jointly supervise and promote their progress, and promote overall expansion, so as to assist in relieving Shanghai refugees. We hope that all merchants in the city will understand this and wish for it.

### Various Charity Organizations Give a Farewell Party for Penna; Mr. and Mrs. Penna Are Enthusiastic in Relief Work; Silver Shields and Gifts Are Presented at the Banquet

According to the Continental Daily, nine charity organizations in this city, including the Chinese Red Cross, held a banquet at the International Hotel yesterday (4th) afternoon to bid farewell to Mr. and Mrs. Penna, well-known relief workers in this city. Dr. Yen Hui-ching hosted the banquet, and silver shields and rice bowls were presented to Mr. Penna to thank him for his hard work in relief work in China. Mr. Penna said in his speech, "I not only hope that Chinese and foreigners will continue to cooperate, but also hope to improve all relationships, and finally be able to promote international friendship, understanding, and mutual assistance." Mr. Penna has worked at Citibank for more than 30 years and is also the treasurer of the American Advisory Committee for Relief of Civilians in China. He will return to the United States with his wife within the month and will reside in the suburbs of Boston.

### Redemption of Principal and Interest on Reconstruction Bonds at the End of the Month; The Ministry of Finance Maintains Debt Credit and Raises Additional Funds for Payment

In order to maintain the credit of domestic debt, the Ministry of Finance will change the payment of principal and interest on public bonds to Chongqing. For the principal and interest on unified bonds and other public bonds that are due, the Chung Kuo, Bank of Communications, and Bank of China will still make payments as usual. Although the customs duties guaranteed by these public bonds are uncollected due to the seizure of customs tax revenue, the government will still find ways to raise funds for payment. The National Debt Fund Management Committee and the Central Bank have both been ordered by the Ministry to pay on schedule, and all methods are the same as those for unification bonds. As for the seventh redemption of the principal of the unification bonds, the Class A bonds are scheduled to be drawn at 10:00 a.m. on the 10th of this month in Shanghai, and the three banks will pay in full on July 31st. The National Debt Fund Management Committee has notified the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the silver and money industry associations, and the First Special District Court to send personnel to the site to monitor the event.

### Export Restrictions by Yantai Customs Postponed for Half a Month; Allowing Chinese and Foreign Merchants to Fulfill Existing Contracts; The Short Deadline Made it Difficult to Complete Orders

According to the Continental Daily, in order to enable Chinese and foreign merchants to fulfill their sales contracts concluded before January 15, the "Provisional Government" of Peiping, through the Yantai Customs authorities, postponed some of the export restrictions imposed last Wednesday until February 15, so that these merchants could complete their outstanding contracts. Among the main commodities for which Yantai foreign trade has temporarily delayed export restrictions, peanuts are also among them. Yantai has been an important export site for peanuts for many years. It is said that many foreign merchants still have a large number of orders that have not been fulfilled when the new export regulations are announced. The reporter asked merchants in this city last night if they believe that the remaining peanut orders can be fulfilled before February 15, but they were vague. Embroidery and lace, straw hats and hairnets are all major export goods from Yantai. In view of the fact that there are still a large number of orders for these goods, the "Provisional Government" of Peiping, through the Yantai Customs authorities, has postponed the export restrictions on these commodities for half a month.

### Fierce Battle at Customs Port; Japanese Army Suffers Defeat; Xu's Troops Arrive Near Minhang; Rumors of Guerrilla Warfare in Bailianjing

Hua's troops, Xu's Regiment, have already arrived near Minhang and had a fierce battle with the Japanese army at the Customs Port a few days ago. Recently, under the order of Commander Li, they took over the defense of Pudong Zhagang, Chegougang, Lujiahui, and other places. A few days ago, the Japanese army launched a three-pronged attack on Xu's Regiment. Xu's Regiment calmly fought back, killing and wounding more than 70 Japanese "puppets," and finally drove out the Japanese marines entrenched there and retreated to warships. Now, all ports in Punan have been strictly defended. Japanese warships have moved to Pudong, and Japanese merchant ships cannot pass through and dock. The Chinese regular army has approached the suburbs of the city, less than fifteen kilometers away. The Japanese side has closed most of the ports in Pudong, except for Wangjiadu, Dujiahang, and Zhagang, and has declared them closed, making it extremely difficult for residents to travel. It is also rumored that guerrilla warfare occurred in Bailianjing yesterday. Currently, the ferry from the concession to the Bailianjing Liuliqiao has been suspended.

### Unified Export of Tung Oil; Handled by China Vegetable Oil Company

Tung oil is one of our country's main native products and occupies an important position in international trade. Since the Anti-Japanese War, because the tung oil production area is still within the scope of the national army's protection, exports have not been affected. Recently, after the government's sharp rectification, personnel have been sent to guide planting in various provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, and Hubei, and the output will increase even more. According to tung tree planters, if the tung oil production area does not change due to war, the annual output can reach more than 70,000 tons in the future. However, the government has successively implemented controls on various major native products. Now, the national export of tung oil has been stipulated to be uniformly bought and sold by the Trade Commission in order to avoid fragmentation. It is heard that the Trade Commission has entrusted this work to the China Vegetable Oil Company.

### Chinese Mobile Unit Seizes Important Weapons at Qiujiang Wharf; Deeply Penetrated at Midnight to Seize Machine Guns and Anti-Aircraft Guns; Several Japanese Soldiers Guarding Were Killed and Withdrew

The Qiujiang Wharf in the downtown area of Shanghai is the zone where the Japanese transport armaments and military supplies are collected. It has been decided that a large number of machine guns and the latest anti-aircraft guns have been transported to Shanghai and stored in the Japanese storage factory near Wusong. However, now the Chinese mobile unit is very active in the Wusong Dachang area. A few days ago, the Chinese mobile unit deeply penetrated at midnight and seized eleven machine guns and a latest anti-aircraft gun and ammunition stored by the Japanese. (This latest product of anti-aircraft gun is very precious) and killed several Japanese soldiers guarding it. After reporting to the superior, they received a lot of awards. However, after the Japanese suffered this setback and lost a large amount of armaments, they have become stricter in their evening preparations and are conducting major searches in various villages.

### Shanghai and Ningbo Business Circles Urge Dredging Transportation; Telegraphing to Both Ministries to Order Customs Clearance to Aid Inland Finance

After the Zhejiang Customs was ordered to prohibit the export of Zhejiang Eastern local products to Shanghai, industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai and Ningbo telegraphed to the Ministries of Finance and Economy, requesting them to order the release of goods to maintain commercial stability and alleviate people's difficulties. The details are recorded as follows:

Request to Release Ningbo Cotton: The Ningbo Shaoxing Cotton Transportation and Sales Office stated that the stored cotton is valued at 10 million yuan. The expiration of the current settlement period, coupled with the ban on transportation, affects the livelihoods of millions of cotton farmers and merchants, as well as resources for the war effort. Moreover, the Ningbo cotton shipped to Shanghai has been verified by the Ministry of Finance's Trade Commission as being destined for Shanghai's public concession, where numerous Chinese-owned yarn factories are located, and which is not under violent control and cannot be designated as a prohibited area. They have detailed the reasons and requested the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce to forward them to the provincial government and the Provincial Property Adjustment Office, and to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to promptly order the Zhejiang Customs to release the goods to aid inland finance. The Chamber of Commerce responded by sending a letter to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the Zhejiang Customs be ordered to release the goods as before.

Tea Merchant Representatives Appeal: The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce also received a petition from more than ten tea merchant representatives, including Shi Henglan, Ye Zhengxing, and Huang Shouji (details omitted above). They stated that part of the raw tea transported by merchants, which has been滞留 in Ningbo, amounts to more than 1,200 pieces. All customs duties, inspections, and other procedures have been completed, and they are awaiting shipment to Shanghai for sale to close their accounts. Recently, they were ordered to prohibit the export of 55 types of local products considered war material, and tea is also on the list of prohibited items. The merchants are extremely anxious. They have read in the newspaper that the director-general, sympathizing with the merchants' difficulties and caring for the country and its people, has taken it upon himself to alleviate their hardships by telegraphing the Ministries of Finance and Economy for approval to order the Zhejiang Customs to allow normal loading and export to aid the situation. The merchants should not have made further requests, but they are all small businesses, and their lives and property are at stake. Moreover, the tea has been transported to Ningbo for as long as four or five months, initially due to incomplete customs declaration procedures, and then due to the suspension of shipping between Ningbo and Shanghai. The expenses for travel, tea transportation, customs duties, and inspections have already caused immeasurable losses. Now, with the sudden ban on export, the small profit they hoped for is lost, and an unexpected major loss is imminent. With the Lunar New Year approaching, and no prospect of export, they cannot return as they wish, nor can they remedy the situation. They are compelled to submit this joint petition, pleading with the director-general to consider their sincerity, sympathize with their difficulties, and continue to telegraph for assistance to maintain commerce and alleviate the people's hardship. They also request a written reply to fulfill the merchants' expectations, and they await orders with the utmost urgency.

### Shanghai Customs to Employ a Large Number of Japanese Personnel, According to Reports from Tokyo

Reuters, Tokyo, 5th: The House of Representatives announced today that after the reorganization of the Shanghai Customs, 70 Japanese will enter the Jianghai Customs as staff members.

### Except for Insured Letters, Money is Prohibited in Letters; Confiscation Upon Discovery

With the end of the year fast approaching, people from various places residing in Shanghai are remitting funds, causing a surge in business for the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. However, due to a lack of understanding of remittance procedures, many people repeatedly fail to enclose remittance receipts in their letters, or even include money in their letters, causing difficulties for the post office. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the person in charge of the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau yesterday that, according to Article 17 of the Postal Regulations, cash and banknotes are prohibited from being sent to various places in the country, except in insured letters. According to the same article, if cash or banknotes are found in non-insured letters, they will be confiscated. Recently, due to the approaching end of the year, remittance business has been quite busy. However, some senders are trying to save money by including banknotes in their letters, unaware that this practice easily endangers the post office's mail. Messengers sent by private households to deliver letters are often tempted, leading to shifting blame onto the post office. In the future, all remitters are urged that, for letters sent domestically, if they have not purchased insured envelopes and delivered them, and if they privately include money, once discovered, the banknotes will be confiscated by the post office in full. The remittance receipt with stamps must be attached to the registered letter, so that the post office can deliver it and make payment accordingly.

### Guerrillas Penetrate Baoshan City, Tie Up Puppets and Leave; Zhao Asan Commits All Kinds of Evil, Public Resentment Boils Over; Father and Three Sons Arrested, Hearers Rejoice

Zhao Asan, a Baoshan native, is over forty years old and lives next to the puppet police station at the West City Gate. He is a plasterer by trade and has always been dishonest, committing all kinds of evil. After Baoshan was occupied by the Japanese army, Zhao used his eloquent tongue to gain the trust of a certain Japanese officer, accompanying him in and out and acting as a puppet for the comfort corps maintenance association, freely claiming to be the chairman of the maintenance association. Zhao Asan took this opportunity to open a contracting factory, first demolishing the

Drum Tower in the center of the city. Countless civilian houses were demolished. Anyone who wanted to build a house had to contact him first. After agreeing on a price, he would demolish someone else's house to build it. The ill-gotten gains from this alone were quite substantial. The people dared to be angry but dared not speak out. At twelve o'clock late last night, more than a hundred guerrillas from a certain unit in the west, carrying thirty Mauser pistols, light machine guns, rifles, and ammunition, suddenly arrived at the West Gate drawbridge. First, three or four people went up the bridge and set up a

Wire mesh frame. Just as they were about to move it, two police officers at the police station discovered them and shouted, "Who are you?" The guerrillas replied that they were detectives. The puppet police, unaware, mistook them for their own kind and helped to remove the frame. The guerrillas swarmed in, each raising a Mauser pistol, first tying up the two policemen and putting them in the station. They also tied up the patrol chief and eight puppet policemen who were already asleep. The remaining team members rushed into the Zhao family next door, arresting Zhao Asan and his eldest son, tying them up securely. The team members, having completed their mission, marched off with Zhao Asan and his son, who called themselves chairmen.

Heading west. At that time, the bound puppet police officers managed to break free and reported to the puppet police bureau on County Front Street. The puppet bureau chief immediately assembled a team and summoned puppet police from the four city gate police stations, as well as Japanese and puppet soldiers, to pursue them in large numbers. Little did they know that the guerrillas had already disappeared like the Yellow Crane. The Japanese puppet soldiers and police chased in vain for a while, and returned without a trace. Therefore, from yesterday onwards, the city area was under special curfew. Major roads such as the West Gate outside the West Market, Slightly Larger Street entrance, and Zhangjia Lane City Gate entrance were guarded by large groups of Japanese puppet soldiers and police, who were strictly checking people and villagers. According to Baoshan residents, Baoshan has a total of eleven major traitors, and Zhao is one of them. His arrest this time has gladdened the hearts of the people.

### Restrictions on Jewish Refugees Coming to Shanghai; Consular Body Has No Solution; Only Telegraphing to Their Countries to Try to Persuade Jews Not to Come; Local Relief Organizations About to Run Out of Funds

The Shanghai Times reported that in late December of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Consular Body regarding the issue of restricting the entry of European refugees, expressing its opinions. Yesterday (the 4th), it was learned from highly reliable sources that the Consular Body has drafted a reply to this suggestion, which will be submitted to the Municipal Council in the coming days. This reply does not propose

Remedies for the issue of refugee entry, and regarding the bureau's request, other than allowing members of the Consular Body to report the current situation in Shanghai to their governments and request them to try to persuade Jews and other refugees not to come to Shanghai, the remaining points have not been agreed to. It is said that the bureau is willing to do everything it can to assist refugees who have already arrived here, but it feels that if serious consequences are to be avoided in the future, Shanghai cannot accommodate any more refugees. Therefore, it has sent

A letter to the Consular Body to discuss measures to restrict or even prevent European refugees from continuing to come to Shanghai. The Consular Body has held several meetings to discuss this issue and has decided to formally submit its reply to the Municipal Council in the coming days. It is said that the Consular Body has considered all relevant factors and has decided that each member of the Consular Body should immediately report this matter to their

Home government, stating that Shanghai's labor and employment problems are quite serious, and requesting the government to use posters and leaflets in travel and shipping agencies to advise immigrants not to use Shanghai as their refuge. However, the Consular Body feels that it can do nothing else, as this is not an easy problem to solve. Germany, Italy, France, and other countries are certainly happy for the refugees to leave, and cannot

Exert pressure on shipping companies not to carry refugees. Chinese consulates in Europe issue passports to those applying to go to Shanghai in accordance with the treaties signed between China and various countries when Shanghai was opened as a trading port. It is said that neither the Consular Body nor the Municipal Council has telegraphed the Chinese government to request instructions for its consulates abroad to stop issuing passports. If the Consular Body and the bureau decide to request the Chinese government to issue this telegram, this measure can also be taken. The reason why this request has not been made

Is obvious: due to the war, Shanghai currently has no passport office, and foreigners coming to Shanghai do not need to go through the procedure of having their passports approved. The situation of Jewish refugees in Shanghai is currently serious. It is expected that by the end of March, their number will exceed 4,000, a large proportion of whom are indeed destitute. More refugees are expected to arrive in about two weeks, but the funds of local Jewish relief organizations will be exhausted. It is said that there is absolutely no certainty of raising the necessary funds at present.

### If a Man Suffers from Kidney Disease, No Matter How Youthful the Companion, Marital Discord is Inevitable

According to Dr. Meng Sili, a German medical doctor, the kidneys are the major source of reproduction and the origin of sperm. They are also the foundation of the body's vital functions. According to physiological analysis, the (Spermini) secretions of the Youth Glands in the kidneys, including adrenal medulla and adrenaline, are the key elements for the development of various parts of the body. They ascend and descend, circulating through the blood vessels to all parts of the body, aiding in their development. Moreover, Spermini is the primary driving force for reproductive functions. Therefore, a person's happiness and the propagation of offspring are based on this. If this fluid is slightly deficient, not only will couples lose their happiness, but the nutrition of all parts of the body will be insufficient. Kidney deficiency, blood depletion, and other diseases will arise from this. The symptoms of kidney deficiency and blood depletion initially manifest as insufficient energy and loss of appetite, making it difficult to perform strenuous work. This is followed by impotence and premature ejaculation, greatly diminishing the joy of life. No matter how youthful the companion, marital discord is inevitable. Even if they have been married for many years, they cannot live in harmony. Before reaching middle age, youth is lost early. Before reaching the age of knowing one's destiny, old age is already evident. Therefore, on cloudy days before rain, one feels lower back pain and bone pain. While reading or working, one often suffers from dizziness and vertigo. There are countless symptoms. If one does not take early care or continues to harm oneself, the lamp will run out of oil, and the consequences will be endless. The inability to have children is especially painful. The way to remedy this is to take the scientifically prepared "German Tiger Pills," which tonify the kidneys, blood, essence, and brain. The main ingredient in this pill is the testicular essence of powerful animals, which can increase the vitality of endocrine functions. It is supplemented with phosphorus to nourish the brain, iron to nourish the blood, calcium to strengthen the bones, and other precious medicinal materials. Therefore, its tonic power is far beyond that of ordinary tonics. Even compared to the tonic power of ginseng and deer velvet, it cannot be surpassed. Moreover, the medicinal power is balanced and comprehensive, benefiting the whole body. Those who are old and suffering from kidney deficiency and blood depletion, exhausted in energy, middle-aged and burdened with work, with emaciated muscles, insufficient brainpower, or young men who have depleted themselves through excessive sexual activity, suffering from nocturnal emission, impotence, premature ejaculation, back pain, and lower back pain, can eliminate all these ailments by taking "German Tiger Pills" for a few days. They will strengthen the kidney function, replenish essence and spirit, invigorate qi and blood, have rosy cheeks and smooth skin, strengthen muscles and bones, increase body weight, transform the sick into the strong, and enjoy family happiness. What could be better? The price of "German Tiger Pills" is two yuan for a large bottle and one yuan for a small bottle.

### Mountain Paths Blocked by Snow, Foreigners Unable to Leave Kuling; More Than Ten Suffering from Illness, Especially Unable to Endure the Hardship; Kuling Founder Liddell Dies

The Continental Daily reported that yesterday (the 4th), according to the wife of a major American expatriate in Kuling, if the Japanese authorities forced the foreigners in Kuling to evacuate, the fate of the sixteen to eighteen sick foreigners trapped in the mountains would be death. The wife listed the names of those who could not endure the hardship of descending the mountain and said that even in peaceful times, with mild weather, few of these sick foreigners could safely descend the mountain. Now, in the middle of winter, with the added war, the thought of evacuation is difficult to realize. The steep mountain paths are blocked by snow and frozen, making them treacherous to walk on. Even the sturdy Chinese coolies dare not venture there. Therefore, the sick cannot be carried down the mountain at present, and healthy men will not abandon the sick to seek safety alone. This is what she dares to say. The wife concluded that forcing the foreigners in Kuling to evacuate at this time would be better than bombing them to death. Liddell, the founder of Kuling, passed away last Thursday at his residence in New Silk Lane, and a Japanese spokesman announced on the same day that he had ordered the foreigners to evacuate. Liddell used to serve in the American Methodist Church in Jiujiang, and in 1895 he first negotiated the purchase of property by foreigners in Kuling. He was seventy-five years old this year.

### French Concession to Award Medals to Father Gherzi

The French Concession authorities, in recognition of Father Gherzi, director of the Xujiahui Observatory, for his years of service and outstanding achievements, have decided to award him the gold medal of the French Concession. Mr. Blanc, director of the newspaper's news department, who resigned at the end of last month, will be awarded the silver medal.

### Japanese Attempt to Expand Shanghai-Songjiang Railway, Forcibly Repairing Yunzaobang Bridge; Vehicle Traffic Very Dangerous

Since the outbreak of the war, the surface of the Shanghai-Songjiang Railway has been damaged, especially the section from Zhanghuabang to Paotaiwan in the north, where the rails have been destroyed and the roadbed has collapsed, as if on flat ground. The Yunzaobang Railway Bridge was previously filled in with wooden planks by the Japanese army, and cars traveled back and forth, causing the bridge to rot. Since the Japanese merchants repaired and opened the Shanghai Railway from Zhanghuabang to the south, it has only reached the grain and rice stack wharf. Recently, it was heard that the Japanese are planning to extend the line to Baoshan. One rumor says it needs to be built to Liuhang, which is certain, but it is difficult to predict now. However, the Yunzaobang Railway Bridge has been hiring 40 to 50 craftsmen since last month to repair it. Currently, cars enter and exit, and they now pass through the Yunzaobang Bridge on the west side. However, the bridge has been burned twice in the "January 28th" and "August 13th" incidents, and the bridge deck has been narrowed repeatedly. Now, it is only a foot or so wide, and only one car can pass through at a time, which is very dangerous. On the open space on the north bank of the bridge, there are piles of old boilers of various sizes, as well as scrap iron such as damaged car leaf spring axles, etc., collected from various places (estimated to be about 1,000 piculs). They must wait for the ship to arrive before they can be transported to Japan for use.

### Shanghai Residents, Please Note: The Importance of Year-End Preparations - Not Just Old Wives' Tales - Worth a Read for Homeowners

Be Careful of Fire: As we approach the end of the lunar year, the countryside retains

its ancient customs. One often hears the watchman's cry of "

Be careful of fire!" in Shanghai's

neighborhood streets. However, Shanghai's material progress

far surpasses that of the countryside. In the cold weather, with electric heaters and water radiators,

the warning "Be careful of fire!" seems outdated. However, homeowner

couples work hard all year, inevitably depleting their physical strength. If

they don't nourish themselves in time, not only will various old ailments

likely recur in the spring, but even those without pre-existing conditions may experience

a decline in energy, with each year worse than the last. During this time,

children to parents, wives to husbands, younger siblings to older siblings, should use

the cautionary words of "Be careful of fire!" to pay attention to their health,

and purchase appropriate tonics. For example, "Weiling Malt Extract Cod

Liver Oil" nourishes the brain, treats the lungs, strengthens the stomach, and builds the body,

produces essence and replenishes blood, and is fragrant and delicious. "Weiling Pure Cod Liver Oil" is pure

and not fishy, and its efficacy is significant. These two are most suitable. The Zhengwei Pharmacy,

opposite the Grand Theater on Second Avenue, sells them. The price of

Malt Extract Cod Liver Oil is $1.80 per three-pound bottle, and Pure Cod

Liver Oil is $2.40 per large bottle. To commemorate the 10th anniversary of its launch,

10,000 bottles are given away. Buy one get one free, a truly rare

opportunity. Furthermore, in terms of winter protection, one should also be aware of

the Descent of Petty Thieves: Considering the body, if the weather is

unpredictable, it is easy to catch a cold and cough.

This is no different from burglars entering a home, employing

their means of robbery. Therefore, the common term is "wind evil." This ailment may seem minor,

but its impact is significant. Conditions such as pneumonia, asthma, tuberculosis,

and hemoptysis are often triggered by colds and coughs, which is no less

dangerous than a burglar injuring the homeowner. The "Weiling Compound White Pine Syrup,"

sold by Zhengwei Pharmacy, is the most suitable lung medicine for the Chinese body,

far superior to other similar preparations. Each bottle is priced at one dollar, with a special price of 75 cents. Those who are ill

should buy it quickly. Even those who are not ill should buy a bottle to have on hand, as treating

colds and coughs as early as possible is best. This "Weiling Compound White Pine Syrup"

is the sentinel of respiratory diseases.

However, daily nutrition is primarily based on food. If the

appetite is poor, food intake is low, or absorption is weak, making assimilation difficult,

it is as if

the Doors are Wide Open: Easily inviting thieves into the house, leading to

a multitude of diseases. Therefore, if stomach ailments are not treated,

nutrition is insufficient, and the body is weak.

Even if delicacies are available every day, it will be in vain. Taking too many tonics is

beyond reach and difficult to fully succeed. However, stomach ailments are often not

easily cured. Those who have been sick for a long time, eat little and have many troubles, find it extremely

difficult. Zhengwei Pharmacy manufactures and sells "170 Stomach Pain Medicine," which has been tested repeatedly and shown to be effective immediately and cure the root cause. It can be said to be the new era of stomach medicine.

Whether new or old stomach ailments, stomach pain, bloating, vomiting, constipation, aversion to food,

belching, or acid reflux, it has the miraculous effect of eliminating the disease. Once the stomach ailment is gone, even

coarse tea and plain rice can exert their nutritional power. Preventing

disease is paramount to this. "170 Stomach Pain Medicine" is specially priced at 85 cents per bottle. In addition, in cold weather, there is also a minor ailment, just like

a Kitchen Burglary: Cups, dishes, spoons, and chopsticks disappear without a trace.

The number is very small, but the temporary

inconvenience is significant. For example, the parts of our body

exposed to the outside are often attacked by the cold, resulting in

frostbite, causing unbearable pain and itching. After ulceration, pus and blood

drip, which is quite unpleasant. Zhengwei Pharmacy has "Frostbite Ruyi

Water" specially for treating un-ulcerated frostbite. Once applied, the pain and itching stop immediately.

Apply it quickly every day, and the swelling and redness will subside. For those that have ulcerated, there is also

"Pearl White Jade Ointment" to apply to the wound once or twice a day,

and new flesh will grow quickly, healing it within days. Why should patients endure

years of delay, causing all sorts of inconvenience? Ruyi Water

is priced at 25 cents per bottle, and White Jade Ointment is priced at 40

cents per box. Zhengwei Pharmacy is located at the intersection of Yinghua Street on Second Avenue (

Telephone 92525, free delivery for purchases). Old customers

call it the winter defense headquarters for the human body. It can be said that the name is not exaggerated.

Readers, please do not consider this mere empty words.

### An Unjustly Lost Soul Under a Vehicle

An Eight-Year-Old Child

At the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue

Chongqing, at one o'clock yesterday afternoon,

a child named Xu Guitang,

eight years old, was walking in the middle of the road when suddenly

he was hit by a public bus driving by.

His skull was crushed, and he was bleeding profusely, on the verge of

death. Bao Kong, officer 239 of Chengdu Road Police Station,

saw the accident and recorded the bus number.

He quickly took the injured to Renji Hospital, but

his injuries were too severe. He died on the way

before reaching the hospital.

A Middle-Aged Coolie - At the intersection of Beijing Road and Henan Road,

at around 6:30 last night,

a man, about

thirty years old, wearing

blue shirt and trousers, carrying a bamboo shoulder pole,

was passing through there when a public bus

drove by. He was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked

to the ground, injuring his waist. His breath was faint. Later,

Street Officer 157 of the Fourth Avenue Central Police Station

arrived upon hearing the news and summoned an ambulance, which

took him to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, his injuries were too severe,

and medical treatment was ineffective. He died fifteen minutes later. However,

### The Entire Village of Xujiahui Civilian Village Reduced to Ashes: Approximately 445 Houses and 8-900 Households - Over a Thousand Refugees Face the Threat of Cold and Hunger

The Xujiahui Civilian First Village, located west of Xujiahui Town, near Xuzhen Road, experienced a sudden

fire in the middle of the night the night before, destroying hundreds of reed mat sheds and affecting eight or nine hundred households, as reported in yesterday's newspaper.

Our reporter went to the scene of the fire to investigate. The affected area is located east of Tongwen Academy on Hongqiao Road (i.e.,

north of the Stinky Water Creek). The area was originally part of the Chinese territory and under the jurisdiction of the Xujiahui Police Station.

Since the National Army moved west, it has been incorporated into the Church District, and the security issues

are temporarily managed by the French Police Station. Last year, in July and August,

refugees went there to build reed mat sheds as temporary shelters.

The village has a total of nine lanes from east to west, with house numbers starting from number one and going up to four hundred and thirty-five. The residents

are mostly from Jiangbei and Shandong, with two or three families living in each shed. Most are rickshaw pullers, street vendors,

and workers. At 10:40 PM the night before, a fire suddenly broke out in the home of Huang Yiqing,

a vegetable vendor from Gaoyou, at number 329. At that time, the north wind was howling, and sparks were flying in all directions.

The fire spread quickly and could not be contained. Shanghai Guoyi Hospital Clinic at 313 Xuzhen Road

and neighboring barbershops, teahouses, pancake shops, grocery stores, etc.

were also affected. Fire brigades from the English and French Concessions drove to the scene to put out the fire. However,

due to the lack of tap water, they used hoses to connect from the French Concession, which was quite time-consuming. The fire was finally extinguished at around one o'clock yesterday morning.

All 435 houses in the village were reduced to ashes. Fortunately, there were exits on all sides, and no one was killed.

At this time of severe winter cold, it is hoped that Shanghai philanthropists will have great compassion and quickly

arrange for relief. Otherwise, over a thousand refugees will inevitably face the threat of cold and hunger.

### Stolen Items at Japanese Military Camp - Forced to Strip Naked - Stabbed to Death by Japanese Soldiers

A tragic murder case occurred in the Nantou area of Pudong

yesterday, resulting in the death of a fisherman. The cause of this incident

was extremely minor. Previously, twelve bags of wheat were stolen from a warehouse

on the wharf, and the perpetrators could not be found.

Not long ago, a large number of comfort items such as towels and socks were also stolen from

the Japanese military camp.

In an area guarded by armed soldiers, theft cases

occurred repeatedly, causing anger and shame. Yesterday morning at 11

AM, there were two fishermen near the wheat warehouse

casting their nets to catch fish. Suddenly, four Japanese soldiers

came forward to interrogate them. One of them, unable to understand the language, was

terrified and fled. The other was arrested and forcibly accused

of being the wheat thief. He was forced to strip

naked on the spot and then stabbed to death with guns. He was buried on the spot.

Those who heard this were heartbroken.

### Businessman Despairs Due to Debt

A traveler, claiming to be Song Yonggong, 42 years old,

from Suzhou, arrived at Ningyu Inn on Mini Teinyin Road in the French Concession

at around 5 PM the day before. He was in the hardware

business and booked room number 77.

Recently, due to the approaching end of the lunar year, he suffered significant losses and could not make up for them. He

suddenly had the thought of ending his life. He secretly ingested raw opium

to commit suicide. It was not until 11 AM yesterday morning that the tea server

noticed and reported it to the Songshan Road Police Station, who sent a detective

to take him to the hospital for treatment.

### Snow on the First Day of Spring - Sudden Change in Weather

windy all night. Yesterday was the first day of spring, but it was

bitterly cold. It even snowed in the morning, a

that the temperature in Jiangnan suddenly turned cold, which was

due to the southward push of the Siberian high-pressure system.

### Lin Chengyong Accused of Falsely Establishing a Business - Accusations of Fraud, Embezzlement, and Breach of Trust - Defendant Avoids Service of Summons - Awaiting Complainant's Notification to Summon to Court for Further Questioning

Lu Ruzhou of Qixin Silk Shop, 7 Taozhu Lane, Jiujiang Road,

recently hired a lawyer to file a criminal accusation in the First Special

District Court, accusing Lin Chengyong, the owner of Zhaofeng Silk Shop,

of falsely establishing a business, obtaining money through fraud,

embezzlement, and breach of trust, along with related civil claims.

The facts of the lawsuit are that the plaintiff, on

June 15th of the previous year, through the defendant's

introduction, ordered ten

loads of "Yan Nu" brand white factory silk (a type of orchid silk)

from Shen, the accountant of Yonglong Silk Factory in Wuxi, at a price of 840 yuan per load, and paid a deposit of 500 yuan.

The deadline for full payment was set for July and August, with a

receipt written, with the seals of the defendant and Shen, the accountant of Yonglong Silk Factory, as proof.

On July 27th of the same year, the defendant claimed that the delivery date had arrived and asked the plaintiff to

pay 890 yuan first to release five loads of goods. The remaining amount would be secured by him through a deposit of 2,000 yuan.

The deposit interest

was 9.5 yuan per month,

borne by the plaintiff. The plaintiff paid the amount as required.

The payment of 890 yuan, evidenced by a Kangzhuang bank draft dated August 6th of the same year, was made in the name of Zhaofeng Silk Shop by the defendant.

Unexpectedly, after that, the defendant avoided the plaintiff like Yi Xing. The

Zhaofeng Silk Shop and Shen, the accountant of Yonglong Factory, also disappeared without a trace.

Although they met once afterwards, he still used

evasive tactics. Therefore, according to Article

339 of the Criminal Law, the

fraud crime, and Article 335 of the same law, the

embezzlement crime, and Article 342 of the same law, the breach of trust crime,

a lawsuit was filed with your court, and because the defendant had a risk of flight, a warrant was requested

for arrest, ordering him to hand over five

loads of white factory silk and the deposit receipts for the remaining five loads, or

compensate for the value of ten loads of white factory silk, deducting the 7,010 yuan that the plaintiff should have paid, and the interest on the deposit, etc.

The case was summoned for questioning in the Criminal

Court 4 by Judge Liu Yugui the previous afternoon.

Because the defendant's address

was unknown, the summons

could not be delivered. The lawyer representing the plaintiff stated that the defendant was indeed in Shanghai and intentionally refused to accept the summons.

Therefore, it would be best to ask your court to approve the issuance of an arrest warrant. Otherwise, the plaintiff will notify

the defendant to appear. Judge Liu postponed the case for further questioning, awaiting the plaintiff's notification for the defendant to appear in court.

### Sheltering Street Children - Combining Education and Training - The International Relief Committee Is Handling It Very Seriously

The Shanghai International Relief Committee, recognizing that street

children are instigated by bad people to form groups of

thieves, often stealing in the streets and alleys. If

and various parties, it opened the Street Children's Vocational Education and Training Institute on Xiamen Road.

It is now known that the institute has bamboo work, carpentry, shoemaking,

towel making, mending, tailoring, and weaving,

all taught by experienced teachers.

In addition, full-time teachers are hired to implement primary education.

The children are divided into two groups: studying and

learning skills. One group attends classes, and the other group works,

alternating in rotation so that there is no conflict. The classrooms and

school supplies are complete. The dormitories are well-ventilated, and the

children each have their own beds. The bathroom is equipped with

shower baths. The factories are also quite spacious. Every day,

work and play are scheduled. Recently, the Public Works Department

ordered a large batch of basketry from the institute. All the clothes and shoes worn by the children in the institute

are also made by themselves. The results of the operation are deeply praised by all sectors of society.

follows: Lu Binggen, 54 years old; Lu Xiaoshan, 23 years old; Chen Hongshi, 42 years old. After

Record of Yao Bolin's Birthday Banquet

Yao Bolin, a well-known medical writer in Shanghai's new medical community,

has devoted most of his life's energy to the publication

of medical books, with numerous publications and national recognition. Yesterday

was his sixtieth birthday, and he held a banquet for guests at

Hongyun Restaurant on French Avenue. Among the relatives and friends, many presented

gifts of poetry and prose, a dazzling array, beautiful

and exquisite. Furthermore, he has a lifelong passion for music and drama, so

he has many friends in the amateur opera circle. They

performed opera to celebrate his birthday, adding to the festivities.

The gentleman felt that at this time, it was inappropriate to hold such a celebration, but

he could not refuse his friends' persistent requests and had to reluctantly agree.

So, his friends gave him a performance.

The programs included "Ascending to Heaven," "Yuelai Inn," "Catching and Releasing Cao," "Chunxiang's School Frolic," "Mei Long Town," "Fen River Bay,"

"Sitting in the Palace," and "Trying the Head and Tattooing the Soup." The performances were all

vivid and wonderful. The grand finale was Guo Chunyang's "Dingjun Mountain."

Guo's art was taught by Yu Shuyan.

He has been in Shanghai for two years.

Although various stages have competed to hire him, Guo has been cautious

and reserved, not wanting to perform easily due to the uneven quality of the roles.

Because of his teacher-student relationship with Mr. Yao, he finally

showed his skills. This play is a *kaoba* old male role opera,

with equal emphasis on civil and military aspects, with singing and acting.

Guo performed with heroic spirit, outstanding and exceptional, truly

a masterpiece. Furthermore, according to a certain gentleman, among the amateur

performances that evening, in addition to Guo's "Dingjun Mountain," Xinfu Jushi's "Catching and Releasing Cao" was quite excellent.

Miss Ye Huimin's Chunxiang was petite and lovely, and her pronunciation

was clear. Her gestures were lively, and her performance was truly

rare and valuable. Mrs. Wang Weikang's Fengjie

was performed vividly. Miss Ye Wenqiu's

"Tattooing the Soup" showed her skilled singing and generous acting,

which was even more amazing. By the time the performance ended, it was

midnight.

### Proposal for Reorganizing Education in Gansu Province, Already Determined by the Gansu Education Department

(Lanzhou Correspondence) The Gansu Education Department, in order to reorganize education throughout Gansu Province, to connect with frontline anti-Japanese war efforts, and to achieve practical results in anti-Japanese war education, has specially drafted a proposal for reorganizing education. The content is divided into five areas: secondary education, primary education, local education, social education, and frontier education. Regarding the reorganization of secondary and primary education, the Education Department convened the principals and teachers of various middle and primary schools. Following the principle of rationalizing personnel management, and taking into consideration the actual circumstances of each school, they discussed in detail and formulated separate improvement plans. Regarding the reorganization of local education, the Education Department convened the education bureau chiefs of fifteen counties in the First Administrative Region, and the principals of those counties, to formulate a draft plan based on actual circumstances. They also consulted with the Finance Department to compile local budget estimates, increase funding, improve the salaries of teachers and staff, and enrich and increase school classes, in order to accommodate a large number of out-of-school children. Furthermore, following the policy of integrating education and administration, a complete primary school or junior primary school will be established in each Lianbao and Bao chief's office. This will be managed concurrently by trained principals, achieving the combined effect of managing education, training, cultivation, and hygiene. In addition, a large number of trained students will be assigned to work in various counties by the provincial government, with the aim of implementing anti-Japanese war education, revitalizing rural areas, and strengthening the forces of resistance. Regarding the reorganization of social education, the provincial government will gradually extend it to various counties, and provisional measures for supplementary education for out-of-school people in the provincial capital have been established in Lanzhou. Adult classes will be established in private primary schools in various provinces and counties. In villages without schools, local temples and public places will be used to set up public schools for the people. Regarding the reorganization of frontier education, it is planned to enrich the existing Hui and Tibetan primary schools in ten counties such as Gaolan, establish Hui and Tibetan central primary schools in five counties such as Linxia, and promote compulsory education for Hui and Tibetan people in thirty-three counties such as Gaolan. To cultivate teachers for this purpose, it is also planned to establish a provincial Lanzhou Special Normal School.

### School Overview: New China College

New China College in this city was founded at 12:88 by Hu Yaomei, the Director of General Affairs and Head of the Department of Mathematics and Physics of China Public School, who gathered some professors from China Public School. After half a year of preparation, it was finally established and named New China Public School. The position of principal was held by Bai Wenwei, a director of the school board. After the war subsided, it formally requested approval from the Ministry of Education. It was approved, and the Ministry ordered that "New China Public School" be renamed New China College. At the beginning of its establishment, the school had more than 500 students, most of whom were students from China Public School. After two years of operation, the results were remarkable. Later, due to environmental reasons, it was suspended in the middle until after the "August 13" Incident. Some of the school board members, in view of the fact that universities in Shanghai had moved inland to start classes, and there were many young students who were left in Shanghai and felt the pain of losing their studies, decided to revive New China College in order to help these young people. After much planning, classes officially started in February of the 27th year of the Republic of China. Hu Yaomei, the former director of New China College and president of Zanwenli College, was elected as the president of the school. The president embraced the spirit of hard work and managed all school affairs. Shi Pin was hired as the Secretary-General, Wu Guangren as the Dean of Academic Affairs, Lu Shaoguang as the Director of Registration and Secretary, Shao Mingjiu as the Director of the Middle School Department, Hu Puan as the Dean of the School of Arts, Ling Shumo as the Dean of the School of Law, and Qiu Zhenglun as the Dean of the School of Commerce. The academic departments are: (1) School of Arts and Sciences: Department of Arts and History, Department of Education and Sociology, Department of Mathematics and Physics, Department of Chemistry; (2) School of Law: Department of Law, Department of Political Science, Department of Economics; (3) School of Commerce: Department of General Commerce, Department of Banking and Accounting; (4) Affiliated Middle School: Divided into senior and junior high levels. Since its revival, the school's affairs have been flourishing. This semester, in order to expand the scope, in addition to the original school buildings, the fifth floor of the Pudong Building and the foreign-style house at No. 826, the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Haifang Road, have been leased as the second and third school buildings. In order to sympathize with the economic difficulties of young students seeking education, the tuition fees for universities, middle schools, and primary schools have been reduced: 30 yuan for the university department, 18 yuan for the senior high school, 14 yuan for the junior high school, 10 yuan for the senior primary school, 8 yuan for the intermediate primary school, and 6 yuan for the junior primary school. The teaching is strict and does not tend to empty talk. The affiliated middle school is mostly taught by famous professors from the university department, who are responsible for various major courses. The primary school teachers have also been carefully selected.

### Who is Crazy?

— Ming Fu

It seems that it was Charles who once wrote a novel about a person who ran into a country of blind people and was treated as a blind person by the people in the country. Out of pity for him and to help him, they insisted on blinding his eyes so that he could live a healthy life with them. Unable to resist, he had to escape.

This is of course a fable. In fact, there may not be a country of blind people. However, what is necessarily absent in reality is often present in principle. We cannot ignore this principle.

I once visited a mental hospital, where all kinds of crazy people were locked up. As I walked through the corridor, I heard them crying, laughing, and, most commonly, shouting and cursing incoherently. They almost all said the same thing: "Who is crazy! You are the crazy ones! I am a perfectly normal person. Why are you locking me up here?"

This is the same principle: clearly, they are the ones in the wrong, but they say that others are in the wrong; clearly, they are the crazy ones, but they say that others are the crazy ones, just as clearly, they are the blind ones, but they say that others are the blind ones.

If blind people rule the country, they will definitely make sighted people as blind as they are; similarly, if crazy people rule the country, they will make sane people as crazy as they are. If you refuse to be crazy, they will persecute you and leave you with no way out. If you want to avoid being persecuted to death by them, you have no choice but to leave. Now, in a certain civilized country, many great scientists and great thinkers have fled, which is probably proof of this principle.

Therefore, the country of blind people is a fable, but the country of crazy people is actually a fact. Can you believe it? Moreover, the country of crazy people is not only a unique decoration in the world, but it is actually standing firmly on its feet again and again! Their consistent style is: while they are engaged in aggressive militarism, they accuse those who spend money on self-defense of destroying peace; while they are committing all kinds of dehumanizing acts of destruction, they accuse those who strive for progress of destroying civilization; while they are disrupting order, they say that others are not obeying order;... Their tone and their momentum are exactly the same as those crazy people I saw.

However, the crazy people I saw were few in number and had little power, so they were finally locked up in the mental hospital by sane people and prevented from causing trouble. But these international crazy people are numerous and powerful. If the sane people of all countries in the world do not unite to lock them up in the mental hospital, I fear that the future of the world will fall into an extremely tragic fate.

Recently, Roosevelt's speech on maintaining peace and his willingness to be a supporter of democratic countries is regarded by every sane person as a righteous and serious statement that is enough to illuminate the annals of history. But a certain country's newspaper said that Roosevelt had already "gone mad." This is exactly the behavior of crazy people scolding others for being crazy. How can this not make me think that a certain country has simply become a mental hospital, where so many crazy people are kept!

In the hearts of crazy people, perhaps they are thinking that as long as they seize power and can dominate the world, they can call themselves sane people and accuse others of being crazy. Therefore, their madness is only increasing, and they simply want to turn the world upside down. However, we know that in 1815, Metternich's "Holy Alliance" was not the same as today's "Axis"? Moreover, the power of that "Alliance" was far greater than that of today's "Axis." How long did that "Alliance" last? What did the so-called "holy" ultimately mean? Today, the "Axis" accuses people of being "crazy." If it does not become "the pot calling the kettle black," no one will believe it! What is the use of power? A crazy person is still a crazy person!

Speaking of this, who is crazy seems to be self-evident, and I don't need to waste any more words. But I also heard a very popular joke in Europe and America, which I might as well briefly describe here as a small reference to the question of who is crazy:

It is said that Hitler once went to visit a mental hospital. In advance, the staff of the hospital spent a lot of effort teaching the crazy people the slogan "Long live Hitler!" When Hitler arrived, the crazy people lined up to greet him and shouted that gratifying slogan. But Hitler saw an old man who did not shout the slogan. Hitler angrily questioned him: "Crazy, why don't you shout the slogan?" The old man said indifferently: "I am not crazy; I am the gatekeeper."

### Reading and Writing

— Xia Fu

——Reviewing "New Studies on Novels and Operas"

There are methods for writing, and there must also be methods for reading. That is to say: being able to write good articles must be from gaining insight when reading. Of course, relying solely on hearsay and piecing together a book, forcibly putting on a guise, and naming it textual research or history, this kind of phenomenon is truly too numerous to mention in Shanghai. In the past, such as Jiang Ruizao's "Textual Research on Novels," not only was the rationale unclear, but what was copied was too mixed, and even many book titles were fabricated to boast of erudition. This is one example. Another example is Wang Guowei's "History of Song and Yuan Operas," which was originally not objectionable in terms of compilation. However, he did not dare to be complacent. In his own "Chenfeng Pavilion Series," he signed it as "Textual Research on Song and Yuan Operas." Indeed, judging from the content of that book, the word "textual research" is more appropriate than the word "history." Mr. Zhao Jingshen has worked hardest on novels and operas, and has successively published "Random Notes on Reading Operas," "Idle Talk about Novels," and other works. "A pen as thick as an oak tree, a heart as fine as a hair," he can truly be called. Although he calls himself "random notes" and "idle talk," in fact, every article has extremely insightful views, hinting at his meticulously crafted reading methods. Now, his new work "New Studies on Novels and Operas" (World Book Company edition, price 5 jiao) has been published. Personally speaking, this type of book suits my taste, and after reading it, I would like to say a few words—say what I want to say.

In the novel section, the article that I admire the most is "Chronology of Xia Erming, Author of "Rustic Words"." This is simply using all one's strength to catch a rabbit. The materials he took are almost all those that others have not noticed. However, he made them into historical materials with authenticity. For a "Xia Clan Genealogy," he personally went to Jiangyin and visited the descendants of Xia Erming. To spend such energy on an article of less than 10,000 words can truly make those who rely solely on hearsay and are unwilling to put in actual effort ashamed to death. Now, the play "Wen Su Chen" is being performed continuously to a full house. I don't know if most people know who this Xia Erming is, and what Xiang Ling, Xuan Gu, and Hong Xuke are.

In "The Origins and Influences of "Timely Words to Admonish the World" and "Constant Words to Awaken the World"," he returned all eighty short stories to their mother's homes. The effort he spent was not just overnight, which is also what I admire the most. If the history of Chinese novels is reorganized using his method, I believe it will definitely be able to change its appearance. In the opera section, he expressed a new opinion whenever he read a book. Anyone who has studied zaju and legendary operas should carefully examine this point, unless they "forget their ancestors" and gloss over those things, only knowing to talk superficially about the current Peking opera.

In the article "Exploring the Source of Yongxi Music Palace," he actually corrected the biggest omission for those who compiled books in the Ming Dynasty, which is more practical than simply compiling a Western Chamber Romance songbook. Ma Lian's annotated "Record of Ghosts" also took a lot of effort. Under the clear vision of Mr. Zhao, he also corrected many of Ma Lian's mistakes. Unfortunately, Mr. Ma has passed away and did not have the chance to see the red ink of this fellow practitioner.

In short, this is a very readable book. If you are very interested in studying novels and operas, then it will be of great help to you. The lightness and fluency of the writing is just a side issue. The best thing about this book is that it reveals the author's own reading methods. His focus is on the evolution of history, and he never says a word without evidence.

### Our Air Force Soldiers

— Zhang Meidi

——In Memory of My Deceased Friend, Huang Hualin

When the Battle of Shanghai was at its fiercest, I was still in Nanjing. The situation was tense, but the Japanese air raids were not taken lightly. Everyone shared the same hope: to hear news of Japanese planes being shot down. Traffic between Nanjing and Shanghai was intermittent, and letters from relatives and friends were also scarce. When I did receive one or two, I would cherish and read them carefully. Especially Dehua's letters, I looked forward to them every day. One day, when I found her letter on my desk, I quickly grabbed it, got into a car, and sneaked off to Houhu alone.

The lake was very still, with no sound of boats. The fallen leaves of the plane trees rustled. Zhongshan Mountain was also shrouded in a hazy mist. The earth was quiet, and tourists were very few. I sat on a bamboo chair, carefully reading Dehua's letter, and at the same time, I noticed a young man sitting across from me, also reading a long letter.

"Comrade, are you in the Air Force?" I asked abruptly, noticing the insignia of the Aviation Department on his collar.

"Yes, I just transferred to this post from Hangzhou," he said modestly.

After a few minutes of conversation, we seemed to hit it off. I first expressed my deep respect for their efforts in defending Nanjing's airspace. He replied lightly, "This is precisely the opportunity for us young people to dedicate ourselves to the motherland!" Such a powerful answer resonated in my ears, and my heart was deeply moved!

We chatted enthusiastically, and we got along very well. Our friendship deepened day by day, and we visited each other in our free time. He liked to drink, and I was also a lover of wine. The Fuchang Restaurant and the International Friendship Club often had us two seated there. In our two months of friendship, he left a deep impression on me. I learned about his background. He was indeed a passionate and determined young man. Tall, with a high nose, with the demeanor of the South, yet so forthright in his temperament, yet so amiable, always with a smile on his face. Wearing the leather coat given by Madame Chiang, he looked particularly heroic, and everyone who saw him would praise him.

Huang Hualin, isn't the name very sonorous? He was from Zhongshan County. His father was a Nanyang overseas merchant. He had no brothers or sisters, only a fiancée, Miss Lin, who was still studying at the University of Hong Kong. The letter he was reading at Houhu that day was Miss Lin's letter of encouragement from Xiangdao!

He was a graduate of the Aviation School. When the August 13th Shanghai Incident occurred, he participated in the bombing of the Izumo warship and other operations, achieving great merit and earning the trust of his superiors. He was now responsible for the air defense of the capital. Therefore, whenever the air raid sirens sounded, our brave Air Force would be dispatched to prepare for battle, soaring into the sky. I always thought, perhaps my good friend is piloting the plane?

Today, the sky is very clear. I subconsciously anticipated that Japanese planes would definitely come to raid. Sure enough, in an instant, the air raid sirens blared loudly. Today, Japanese planes divided into four groups, attacking the capital, totaling seventy-eight aircraft. Our heroic Air Force also dispatched a large force, dealing a heavy blow to the Japanese planes. At the same time, anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns formed a dense fire net, firing intensely. The sky had turned into a world of torches, becoming an unprecedented spectacle.

"Today, nineteen Japanese planes were shot down!"

When I heard the news of this victory at my brother's house, I was extremely excited. My friend must be fighting too! I thought. "Sir, a phone call, from the Central Hospital," the servant came over and called. I was suddenly startled and went to answer it.

"Is this Mr. Zhang? A Mr. Huang wants to say a few words to you, please come quickly!"

I drove to the Central Hospital. There at the entrance, a nurse in white stopped me. "Are you Mr. Zhang? Alas! You are five minutes late. Comrade Huang has gloriously passed away! He died gloriously: he shot down two Japanese planes, but unfortunately suffered several gunshot wounds himself. He was still able to calmly bring the plane down safely. When he arrived at the hospital, he instructed that you be asked to see him. Alas! Only five minutes too late!" She handed me a piece of paper with handwriting on it, with only a few simple words:

Good friends:

I'm leaving first. For the sake of the motherland, please continue your efforts! Okay! Take care! Work hard!

I blanked out and lost consciousness. I don't know when or who sent me back to my brother's house.

Now, Houhu has been ravaged by the enemy into who knows what state. Dehua has also fled to who knows where. But I don't think about her; I only often miss my brave friend: sleep well! I will always remember you. Let me tell you: the dawn of victory has unfolded. (Fees for refugees)

### Still the Same Old Story.

Novella

### In the Flames of War

— Zhou Yan

At this moment, a burst of commotion suddenly erupted on the street outside, vaguely sounding like many people shouting, "Look at the planes!" "Look at the planes!" The voices of conversation at the table suddenly ceased, and everyone listened intently to the outside. After a while, several people couldn't resist and ran to the courtyard first, and then simply ran to the street. Regiment Commander Ye also slowly followed behind, seeing a large crowd gathered on the street, chattering noisily, he couldn't help but frown secretly, feeling that they had no military common sense at all, and quickly shouted:

"Disperse quickly, don't crowd together, be careful of being targeted by enemy planes!"

Although everyone noticed his military uniform, no one was willing to listen to him, still crowding together and not dispersing. Regiment Commander Ye had no choice but to take out the binoculars he carried with the army to look at the sky. There were three silver-gray planes flying in the sky, arranged in a T-shape, with two fighter planes protecting a heavy bomber. He couldn't help but stomp his foot and say:

"Don't hurry up and disperse, the one in the back is a bomber, it will drop bombs."

Just as he was saying this, the planes in the sky suddenly descended, and began to fire machine guns "ka ka ka ka," for a moment bullets jumped like raindrops on the rooftops and the ground with a "pop pop" sound. Someone in the crowd had already shouted "Ouch!" and fell to the ground, unable to get up. Then, the people in the street let out a cry, and everyone scattered in a burst. The several guests who were accompanying Regiment Commander Ye at the table all fled in a panic toward the public office. Although Town Chief Chen and Elder Mr. Ye had not moved, looking at the panicked appearance of everyone, they couldn't help but be frightened, their faces pale.

Then there was another very loud "Boom!" The ground shook violently, and several wine glasses on the table were overturned, and wine spilled all over the ground.

Regiment Commander Ye returned to the courtyard and saw that the three planes had circled the town once and followed Taihu Lake, slowly flying towards the northwest. Only when he could no longer see the shadows did he come in, walk around Elder Mr. Ye, and bid farewell to Town Chief Chen.

Town Chief Chen, while calling all the guests to accompany them, still earnestly urged Elder Mr. Ye and Regiment Commander Ye to finish the meal before leaving. But in such a situation, Elder Mr. Ye was naturally unwilling to stay long, and even the guests were restless, and no matter how delicious the delicacies were, they couldn't swallow them. Finally, everyone agreed to let this welcoming feast end hastily, and respectfully escorted the two distinguished guests all the way to the entrance of the township office. Town Chief Chen kept saying:

"I'm sorry! I'm sorry!" (5)

### Should Rickshaw Pullers Be Able to Read and See Newspapers?

— Qin

Twenty-five years ago, I passed through Japan and saw many rickshaw pullers reading newspapers by the roadside.

How many rickshaw pullers in Shanghai today can read newspapers? Five or six years ago, the rickshaw puller problem was very serious in Shanghai. Chinese and foreigners alike loudly called for their happiness. Soon after, the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association was established.

The work of the Mutual Aid Association has achieved considerable success to this day, such as diseases being treated, children being admitted to schools, disputes being resolved, and lives being improved. This cannot but be attributed to the efforts of the directors of the Mutual Aid Association. However, there is still room for improvement in the area of education. Although the association has popular lectures to disseminate hygiene knowledge and a reading room for browsing, it is a pity that it has not yet established a school so that more than 90% of the illiterate rickshaw pullers can read and see newspapers.

Everyone cannot deny that rickshaw pullers should be able to read and see newspapers. But some people think that rickshaw pullers are in a difficult situation, with difficult lives, working hard all day long, and still unable to get enough to eat and stay warm, so how can they have time to study and learn to read? I deeply sympathize with the difficult lives of rickshaw pullers: no one sympathizes with the fact that rickshaw pullers should be illiterate. On the one hand, we improve the lives of rickshaw pullers, and on the other hand, we should give rickshaw pullers the opportunity to learn to read.

It is hoped that the directors of the Mutual Aid Association will be responsible for promoting this matter. I hope that in the near future, rickshaw pullers can be seen everywhere in Shanghai reading newspapers!

### Talking About Education for Refugee Children (Continued)

— Tang Qingkai

Indeed, the education of refugee children is very different from ordinary primary school education, and it cannot be known without practical experience. Now, let me explain the differences separately. Regarding equipment: In the simple shelter, it is mostly difficult to find a suitable classroom, let alone equipment. Without desks and chairs, the refugee children stand to attend classes. If the hours are longer, they will easily become tired, and there is simply no way to practice calligraphy and copying.

Regarding the organization of grades: The refugees in the shelter are mobile, so the number of people increases and decreases suddenly. Complex, single-grade teaching is not enough to cope with the situation. The number of people in each grade varies greatly, the level of refugee children is uneven and complex, the level of textbooks cannot be adjusted, and the daily allocation of class time cannot meet the points of general education. Indeed, running refugee children's education in a shelter is a special kind of education, without a fixed way to stipulate it. Teachers must adapt to the situation and adjust and cope with it. Regarding the curriculum: There is no major difference between the curriculum for refugee children and ordinary schools. For example, compulsory subjects in ordinary schools such as Chinese, arithmetic, common sense, physical education, music, and drawing, as well as nursery rhymes and storytelling suitable for kindergarten classes, are all available in refugee children's classes, but the time and speed are not as good as ordinary primary schools. How to improve in a harsh environment is worth studying. Regarding teaching materials, except for Chinese and arithmetic, which have textbooks, teachers have to find materials for other subjects. The author has seen some shelters that specialize in teaching Chinese and arithmetic, while neglecting other subjects. I think the problem of finding materials is also a reason, especially since the scope of common sense lessons is very wide, and reference books should be provided to teachers as much as possible.

Regarding implementation: Talking about education to children is purely mental education, belonging to the infusion of spirit. For children who have been displaced, the role of spiritual education cannot be ignored. Therefore, some people advocate that the implementation of refugee children's education should be based on love. Reading and writing are a last resort. As for class time, it is felt that 7:00 to 10:00 in the morning and 2:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon are most suitable in the shelter, at least three hours a day. Extracurricular activities are also indispensable. Probably because of the unstable life, refugee children generally feel painful in the classroom and have no intention of attending classes. To make refugee children feel interested, teachers must use a way of speaking with spirit to influence them.

In all fairness, being able to actively run education in the harsh environment of the shelter cannot be considered a kind of painstaking effort. In addition to sympathy, I hope to further promote it, organize and educate all the refugees in the city in a sound manner. In this great era, extraordinary education is by no means "education for education's sake" but "education for saving the country." (The End)

A Glimpse of Life

### Yuan Mazi (Pockmarked Yuan)

— Master

When the Shanghai War broke out, Yuan Mazi lost his job. He took the refugee relief society's ship and returned to his hometown. With little savings and nothing to farm, how could he not feel the fear of life? He knew very well the old saying "sitting and eating, even a mountain will be emptied." Looking for a job? In this time of war and increasing unemployment, it was even more difficult. He could only rely on his past honesty, borrow some capital, and set up a stall in front of the post office to sell daily necessities such as cigarettes, matches, and soap, temporarily making a living and avoiding starvation. As the war shifted westward, his hometown suddenly became a paradise for people from Jiangnan to take refuge, and the number of vendors like him increased accordingly. As a result, Yuan Mazi's business declined, which made him feel increasingly strained. But he did not become negative because of this. He thought of other ways to make money. He ordered one or two copies of the Shanghai Shen Bao and the local daily newspaper and created the so-called "open-air reading place," charging four cents. His motto was "spend a little money to read several kinds of newspapers." In general, many people who wanted to know the war situation came to see it, but the Shen Bao was sometimes interrupted due to postal service, which caused his "open-air reading place" to die prematurely. He also knew very well that in this era of commercial warfare, goods must be novel or have a speculative nature in order to avoid being eliminated. Seeing that epidemics were prevalent, he sold timely medicines. In autumn and winter, he changed to selling stationery, vaseline, and frostbite oil needed by children. He also used his experience of often seeing advertisements in Shanghai to promote on the walls near his stall with simple pictures or words, which was not without some harvest. Those who passed by his stall saw that he had more products to sell and the stall had expanded. Was this not his success in striving?

Folktale

### Chen Erlang

— A Da

The city of Jiangyin was captured by the Qing troops. The Qing troops attacked Jiangyin for more than eighty days, and the dead and wounded were countless. This time, Jiangyin was captured. For the sake of revenge, the Qing troops entered the city and killed everyone, regardless of age. They killed so much that the city was full of blood and corpses were piled up like mountains. It was very tragic. Even today, the elderly people of Jiangyin cannot forget the situation at that time. They talk about it with relish.

It was the third day after the Qing troops ordered the sealing of the knives. There were still no people in the streets and alleys. The Qing troops walked by, hating that they had not killed enough Jiangyin people, because they did not see a single person. Suddenly, a Qing soldier saw a corpse on the pile of corpses by the road moving. He could not help but hesitate. Was it a zombie? Was it a wild dog? He did not know. After staring at it once, he said in surprise, "Oh, oh, it turns out to be a person, the opportunity has come!" Saying that, he drew out his waist knife!

Indeed, it was a person, and it was a child of eight or nine years old. He had been hiding in the pile of corpses for four days. This time, he was so hungry that he had to risk crawling out. He was covered in blood, but after wiping it away, it was obvious that he was an innocent and lovely child, with delicate eyebrows and a pitiful appearance, showing a naive childishness, which made the Qing soldier's murderous intent disappear completely, and he felt that he was cute.

"Little fellow, come over, I won't kill you!" The Qing soldier called to him like this, and he fearlessly ran over. "Hey, little fellow, what's your surname?"

"My surname is Chen, people call me Chen Erlang." The child's answer touched the Qing soldier's heart even more. The Qing soldier had been fighting for more than ten years and only knew how to kill. He had never experienced the natural joy between people. Now, hearing Erlang's answer, he laughed out loud, feeling that the little fellow was very funny. "Hey, Erlang, why don't you stay with me?" "Okay, I'll stay with you." "Do you like me?" "I like you." So Erlang went back with the Qing soldier. The Qing soldier bought a few clothes for Erlang in the clothing store. Therefore, he attracted everyone's admiration in the Qing camp, and everyone liked to play with him, and he went in and out of the Qing camp, and it was not surprising. But this matter was heard by the Qing general, who ordered Erlang to be summoned to see him. Everyone was worried about Erlang, thinking that it was mostly bad luck. (To be continued)

### This Week's War Situation

Looking at the war situation as a whole this week, the Japanese army has made little progress. Although they want to attack Beihai in the south and invade the border of Shaanxi in the west, there are many difficulties ahead. The situation on each battlefield is recorded as follows:

Guangdong Area

The Japanese troops along the Yuehan, Guangzhou-Kowloon, and Guangzhou lines have been quiet recently, and the war seems to be silent. After Huaxian was occupied by the Japanese army's two or three thousand superior troops last week, it was actively counterattacked by the army, and it was officially recovered. In addition, the Japanese troops who attacked the Huashajing position have been defeated and retreated towards Taiping under the joint attack of a certain division and local troops. Therefore, the Japanese army in Guangzhou has once again entered the heavy encirclement of the Chinese army. As for the Japanese army on 灟zhou Island, although there are more than two thousand, most of them are Taiwanese, Korean, and Shandong puppet troops, with very few regular troops. There is currently only one small aircraft carrier in the ocean near Beihai, and the rest are patrolling without a fixed location.

Shanxi Area

Since the Chinese army in Jinxi captured important strongholds such as Jixian, Daning, Xiangning, and Puxian last week, the Japanese army was greatly angered. They turned around and made plans from the southwest triangle of Jin (according to the report, this is the place where the Japanese army has spent months and sacrificed the most). The Chinese army positions in Zhongtiao Mountain were fiercely attacked, and they wanted to lay the foundation for future westward progress in the triangular area. Therefore, three thousand Japanese troops with seven cannons attacked Zhongtiao Mountain from Xiexian in three routes. At the same time, another two thousand Japanese troops were sent to attack Heshun from Jinxi and Jinyang in the east, echoing from afar. After the Chinese army fought desperately, the encirclement has now been lifted. The Japanese army in Xiexian is said to have retreated, but the Japanese army in Heshun is still very stubborn. China has withdrawn automatically for strategic reasons. However, the Japanese army at the Guandi Temple suffered heavy losses due to the Chinese army's brave resistance. The two sides offset each other and reached a balance.

Hunan and Hubei Area The war in northern Hunan is calm. Most of the Japanese troops stationed in the Yueyang area have withdrawn to Hubei, concentrating on Huangpi and Xiaogan, seemingly preparing for some action. However, the Japanese side has not benefited from the battles in Jingshan in central Hubei and Xihe in northern Hubei in recent days. Although Jingshan and Tianmen fell one after another last week, Jingshan was once recovered after the Chinese army fought bravely. They are still in mixed battle with the Japanese army. In the battle of Xihe, the Japanese troops suffered considerable losses, and it is expected that the war will definitely turn around. Because the results of the war in the past week have actually explained the situation of the Japanese side's strength.

Other Areas In Henan, the Japanese army in northern Henan attacked the main force of the Chinese army from Boai and Xiuwu with a force of two or three thousand this week. The Chinese army has been effective in blocking them. In southern Anhui, more than three thousand Japanese troops who attacked the Chinese army from Wanzhi this week were continuously resisted by the Chinese army. According to reports, the Japanese side sacrificed more than one-third of them. In Hebei, the Chinese and Japanese forces had a fierce battle in Julu. The situation is unclear. In Suiyuan, after the Japanese army's attack failed last week, there is no major change. However, the puppet troops (4th and 6th divisions) stationed in the Guyang and Wuchuan areas have defected one after another in recent days.

### I

— Editing Reporter

"I" is the term for "person." Heaven did not give birth to "I," it gave birth to "person" first. Only with "person" can "I" be seen. Looking at "I" in my eyes, of course, it is "I"; looking at "I" in the eyes of a person, it is "person."

Therefore, person and I are originally one. If everyone has no food to eat, it is difficult for me to eat my fill alone; if everyone has no clothes to wear, it is difficult for me to stay warm alone; if everyone has no house to live in, it is difficult for me to live in peace alone. I eat rice, people eat porridge; I wear fur, people wear cotton clothes; I live in a house, people live in a shelter. However, the "I" who eats rice, wears clothes, and lives in a house must at least ensure that the "person" has porridge to eat, cotton clothes to wear, and a shelter to live in. Therefore, saving "person" is saving "I." To put it more clearly, it is not saving "person," but saving "I." Even the most foolish person, how could they not even save "I"?

Spring and Autumn

### Suicide

— Geng

Suicide is the most despicable and cowardly act, so the general public only hates suicide and does not pity it.

Suicides want to repent of the cause of suicide by means of suicide, so it is most despicable, and they want to eliminate the difficulties of life by dying, so it is most cowardly. Although it is said that there are many causes of suicide, some are due to unbearable economic oppression, some are due to fighting for freedom of marriage, some are due to the counterattacks of the environment and personnel, some are due to quarrels, and some are due to venting anger, but the loss of reason and the overflow of courage of suicides should ultimately be hated by society.

Since Shanghai has been reduced to an isolated island, there have been more suicides than before. The social page of this newspaper almost has records of suicide news every day, and there are two or three cases every day. The trend of suicide can be said to be very strong!

From these many suicides, it is reflected how difficult life is on the isolated island, how complex the personnel are, and how bad the environment is. For example: As recorded on the social page of this newspaper on the 3rd:

Zhang Liansheng from Yancheng, 41 years old, worked as an accountant in the Meiwuzhai food store on Hankou Road. Recently, he heard that gambling was rampant in western Shanghai, which aroused his curiosity. He secretly went to the gambling dens after closing the market every night, hoping to get lucky, but how could there be a perfect treasure in a tiger pit? Therefore, in less than a few nights, he had lost all his blood and sweat savings, and even delayed the store's account by 50 yuan. The end of the month was approaching, and there was really no way to make up for it. In a moment of desperation, fearing that he would have no face to see anyone, he swallowed poison and committed suicide. This is telling us: how dangerous the traps set up in the so-called Wangdao Paradise on the edge of the isolated island are, and how poisonous and terrible the "prosperity policy" implemented by the puppet organization built on the enemy's bayonet is!

Regarding the incidents of people losing their lives in gambling dens in western Shanghai, we have often heard of them. What is more noteworthy is the suicide by jumping from the International Hotel by waiter Sang Guocai and the Zhang Liansheng incident now. We firmly believe that the general public will not give erroneous sympathy to the suicides of Sang and Zhang, but will rather spit on them. The reason is very simple. The enemy has set up traps to lure you into their clutches. Why act like a moth to a flame and seek your own destruction? Moreover, gambling is originally a sin and should not be curious or hope to get lucky.

However, to be fair, the responsibility for the crime of suicide should of course be borne by the suicide, but the work of eliminating the objective factors of suicide cannot be shirked by the general social workers.

### Outside the Drama Stage

— Qu Shigong

Xu Yu, this popular figure of the "Analects School" and "Cosmic Wind," readers who enjoy humorous writing, probably all know his name.

The gentleman currently writing the "Wednesday Drama Lecture" every Tuesday in "Jina" is none other than the humorous writer Xu Yu.

Isn't it strange? How did Xu Yu start writing "Drama Lectures"?

Now, let me tell you.

Nine years ago, in 1930, Xu Yu had just left Peking University in Beiping. Together with Xie Xing, a graduate of the National Beiping Art Academy, Yu Qizhong, brother of "Salome" Yu Shan, Gong Manman of Jinling University, Gong Jiazhen (pen name Pin Pin) of Jinan Drama Experimental Academy, and Xu Suxue, who was good at singing foreign songs, and dozens of others, they organized a "Time and Space Society" in Beiping. Their publishing department had issued two weekly magazines, "Time" and "Space-Time Movement". Their drama department traveled south to Suzhou on February 11, 1931, and performed "The Miser" (a five-act play by Moliere), "The Mute Wife" (a two-act play by Anatole France), and "One Night Too Many" (a one-act play by Xu Yu) and other three plays in the Dongfang Grand Theater of the North Bureau.

Xu Yu's drama life can be said to have started at this time. At that time, I happened to be in Suzhou and had seen Xu Yu star in "The Miser" and had also seen his play "One Night Too Many." Speaking from my impression, his acting skills were quite good. The only shortcoming was the lack of connection between movements, which might be considered good by outsiders, because some viewers at the time said his performance was very delicate. As for the script, I really dare not compliment it; it had no stage effect at all.

Speaking of their first day of performance, it happened to be a snowy day. Snowflakes fell from the sky all day long, and the ground was covered with thick snow. The "business" was extremely miserable. In the huge theater, only the first few rows of seats were sparsely occupied by a dozen or so spectators. On the second and third days, although the box office was somewhat better, the number of spectators was still less than thirty or forty.

They had originally planned to perform a second time two months later, but unexpectedly, they were met with coldness from the people of Suzhou, and they had no choice but to cancel this plan. Soon, the Time and Space Society also stopped operating in any visible way, and only rented a correspondence address at "No. 31 Shijia Lane" in Suzhou.

Xu Yu's drama life also ended at this time.

Of course, in these short few years, Xu Yu had been exposed to drama theory. But to say that he had done any kind of research, that would be hard to convince anyone.

Xu Yu, you say you are "like a bald camel entering and exiting the thorns," I hope you say less empty words, return to the drama circle, and strive to shoulder the important task of the national salvation movement!

### Sorrowful Sounds from the Radio

— Su Ying

Although there is a radio in my house, I am not very interested in it. Because after the fall of Shanghai, I can no longer hear the magnificent songs and solemn speeches that I like. It is rare to hear something more pleasing to the ear: either it is dizzying and brain-wracking, or it is weird and decadent music. Therefore, I simply put it aside and do not turn it on, which is quieter.

The day before yesterday, for the "broadcast promotion conference of the Children's Education and Care Center," I exceptionally turned on the radio covered in dust, and the whole family sat around listening quietly.

At first, it was a reporter's appeal for the children, but later came the voice of a child, who seemed to be only thirteen or fourteen years old. He opened his mouth and said:

"Listeners, I bow to you here!..."

The voice was strangely miserable, which made us listen more quietly.

"I am thirteen years old this year and from Zhenjiang. Last autumn, I lost my only parents in the chaos. Because I have no relatives, I can only sleep on the side of the road. Later, I met a kind person in his thirties, who introduced me here (Children's Education and Care Center) and paid for my care for six years. Now I can live here in peace, all thanks to him. If this gentleman is also listening, I am very sincerely grateful here..."

At this time, my mother and wife were staring at the radio with their mouths open, moved by the child's broadcast.

"Listeners, I bow to you a second time! Because our education and care center does not just give us enough to eat, but also hires teachers to teach us, so that we will not become useless people who only know how to eat in the future. However, our place is too small, and there are still a constant stream of people as unfortunate as me, so I want to ask all kind-hearted people to donate more to save this group of pitiful little lives. Originally, I was also the son of a good family, with food and clothing, and never asked anyone for a penny. Now my dad... Mom..."

As he said this, he couldn't help but cry out in pain, thinking of his parents.

Shanghai has hundreds of thousands of radios, and there must be many who heard this broadcast. I hope they will help these suffering children more!

Film Review

### Jade Ambition

— Ruhua

Produced by Yihua Film Company, showing at the Xinguang Grand Theater, "Jade Ambition," like "A Couple in a Sea and Sky Love Story," is a pre-war production of Yihua Film Company, and it was not completed. After work was resumed, due to personnel changes after the war, this film did not achieve the expected excellence, which is naturally very regrettable.

However, from the essence of the film, "Jade Ambition" has not diminished its value because it is an "unfinished work." It is an anti-warlord film, depicting the people who are trying to survive under the iron hooves in the era of warlord autocracy and how they are eagerly seeking the arrival of light. Everyone, every heart, for justice, towards the light, is determined to unite, using their flesh and blood to strive for "the final victory." Wang Zhiqun's tragic whipping and the old man in the clock tower's tragic death under the whip, with this spirit of moving forward in succession, finally extinguished the remnants of the warlords represented by Brigade Commander Qin. Therefore, the public screening of "Jade Ambition" "at this time and place" gives us the encouragement to continue this spirit of moving forward in succession, and further strengthens our belief in moving towards the path of victory!

From what we see on the screen now, the director has also done his best to expose the unscrupulous actions of the warlords and the arduousness of the revolutionary party members. For example, at the beginning of the film, he depicts the lackeys of the warlords preying on the people, killing Zhang Ming's parents, and the subsequent whipping of revolutionary party members, etc.

There are also several commendable scenes individually, such as Brigade Commander Qin's birthday celebration: The director first writes about Qin Yuying introducing Hu Gang and Wu Juanfen to meet each other; Wu Juanfen flirting with Hu Gang in the backyard; although Qin Yuying feels unhappy, when Wang Zhiqun asks Hu Gang about it, she asks Zhiqun to accompany her to the theater to avoid breaking Hu Gang and Wu Juanfen's secret. When Zhang Ming assassinated him, and the sound of gunfire erupted, the director handled the complex emotions from many aspects quite well. Secret meeting: He writes it like this: party members send letters to all parties; Wang Zhiqun goes in disguise; Wu Juanfen discovers a secret note; Wu Juanfen calls Hu Gang, but Qin Yuying answers the phone; Brigade Commander Qin receives the phone call; knowing where the revolutionary party members are meeting; Qin Yuying rushes to Wu Juanfen's place, snatches the note and reports it to the party members. After the revolutionary party members are arrested, Wang Zhiqun is whipped, and the old man in the clock tower cannot bear to see this tragic situation and is willing to confess to atone for his sins, and the scenes of being forced to the clock tower to strike the bell are also tense. After Zhang Ming's assassination, he escapes to Hu Gang's bedroom, where he meets Wu Juanfen, who entangles with him and refuses to leave. Finally, she sleeps on Hu Gang's bed. At this time, Wu Juanfen is sleeping on the bed, Zhang Ming is hiding under the bed, and Hu Gang is sitting blankly on the sofa. This is a very interesting scene.

However, the weaving connection is a little chaotic, which makes the development of the whole play quite abrupt. The writing also has problems: the relationship between Wang Zhiqun and Wu Juanfen is not obvious enough: Qin Yuying's infatuation with Hu Gang lacks a process. Before participating in the revolutionary party meeting, Wang Zhiqun's character is unknown. In particular, there are too many coincidences, and at the end, when "mutinies break out everywhere and the city is on fire," it ends with Wang Zhiqun shooting Wu Juanfen, without even the whereabouts of Brigade Commander Qin, which are all big shortcomings.

Among the actors, Wen Yimin's old man in the clock tower is the best, calm and powerful. Yuan Meiyun's Zhang Ming, Wang Yin's Hu Gang, and Wang Naidong's Wang Zhiqun are all competent. Fan Xuepeng's Wu Juanfen is a bit pretentious.

### Written After the Collection of Miscellanea

— A Ying

Brother Lingxi has selected more than 100,000 words of essays he has written in recent years and printed them into a single book, which is truly a gratifying piece of news.

I am very happy to read Lingxi's essays. For five or six years, I have been reading them almost continuously. I feel that in his essays, even a scale or a claw, two or three words, all invariably express a sincere heart, burning with a strong sense of justice. Coupled with a simple and beautiful style, readers feel like they are facing an old friend, under a melon shed and bean trellis, and with respected friends, talking frankly and openly.

Of course, these essays also reflect the changing Chinese society in recent years.

I am very happy about the publication of this collection of essays. At the same time, I hope that in the near future, Brother Lingxi will be able to publish more developed collections of essays.

### After the Rain, a Clear Sky

— Bao Tianxiao

Episode 3: Admiring the Portraits and Remembering the Old Martyrs, Asking the Illiterate to Learn from Little Teachers

He Liyu said, "We have heard about it abroad, but we don't know the details." Jin Danyun said, "Like Old Father Huang, asking his grandson to teach him is practicing the little teacher system. Probably teaching adults with children is more effective than teaching children with adults. Because children naturally have their lovable and delightful aspects, unlike adults, who put on a stern face. Last year, I saw a primary school student's diary, which was written by a little girl student. She wrote: 'Today I taught grandma a lesson, but she refused to read it because she said she was busy. Later, I cried. She had no choice but to follow me and take that lesson.' Grandma refused to study, and the granddaughter cried. Isn't this a joke? However, in the prevailing little teacher system, this seems ordinary." Lin Jiancheng said, "The elderly learning from the young has become popular in China after the war. Near where I live, there is an adult education school. There are also several old women who go to school happily every day. When school is over, people nearby who know her greet her and ask, 'Hey! Old lady, are you dismissed from school?' When I hear it, I feel strangely unfamiliar. I have only ever heard: Little officials are dismissed from school, little girls are dismissed from school, that's what I'm used to hearing. Old lady dismissed from school, but it feels special. But this is ultimately a good phenomenon." The four people left the library, and Jin Danyun wanted to lead them to see other places. However, the sun was already setting in the west, and the two He family ladies wanted to go back. Because they wanted to go to Freedom Village tomorrow and tidy up their father's affairs after returning. Mr. He has come to Shanghai this time, and the two ladies have been temporary secretaries for a few days. Seeing that they wanted to go back, Jin Danyun didn't dare to keep them too much, because touring around everywhere is also very hard. When returning, Jin Danyun drove the car first, and then Lin Jiancheng took over. The two He family ladies can also drive cars themselves, but they are not very proficient. Moreover, they are new to Shanghai and not very familiar with the routes. Recently, the number of private cars in Shanghai has naturally increased compared to before. But there is a principle: people who have cars must be able to drive cars themselves. Except for elderly people and children, as well as people who are deaf and blind, and whose hands and feet are not agile. In particular, wives, people who have cars at home, or who have cars themselves, must be able to drive cars themselves. Because there are very few people who hire drivers now, unless it is in that kind of large car dealership, which has special cars for people to hire for business trips. In a family, both husband and wife can drive cars, and both husband and wife have jobs outside, going out and coming in together, how convenient that is! (32)

### Picking Up Old Records from the Singing Stage

— Junmei

The Northern newspaper reported that Jin Shaomei, who was once extremely popular, has been living in extreme poverty in Zhangjiakou since her separation from the clown Ma Shaoshan, and has even degenerated into a lowly woman in a brothel. According to Shao Xiang, she is the daughter of the Kunqu actress Jin Yuemei. Since childhood, she has been literate and intelligent, and her hearing is exceptionally sharp. When she grew up, she learned Qingyi and Huashan dramas from Jiang Shunxian, a disciple of Shi Xiaofu, and added her mother's insights, so her attainments were extremely profound, and her demeanor was generous. Her appearance was definitely unmatched by other Kunqu actresses at that time. Shaomei's performances can best reflect the plot. When there is joy, she must express it to the fullest; when there is sorrow, she must express it to the fullest. Therefore, when she performed at the Youyi Garden in the south of the capital, most of those who admired her were elderly people with white hair and young ladies. Seeing her joy, they smiled; seeing her sorrow, their hearts ached and tears followed. They even organized old people's associations and ladies' groups to support her strongly. For a time, her fame was almost on par with Xi Kui. But how long ago was this? She has fallen to such a state. For those in this industry, five years is a lifetime. In terms of her heyday, it is indeed so. But the tragedy of the outcome seems to be beyond what was initially expected. Thinking of the line "Powder boxes and rouge tins are discarded, tears are like mud day and night," Shaomei must have unbearable memories!

The play "Battle of Wan City" has gradually become a cold play in recent times. This play includes a variety of roles, whether it is Sheng, Dan, Jing, Chou, or Mo. If Zhang Xiu's Sheng, Zou Shi's Dan, Cao Cao's Jing, Dian Wei's martial arts, and Hu Che'er's somersault, if the pairing is not complete, one would never dare to perform it lightly. In the play, Zhang Xiu's role is played by a Wusheng or a Laosheng. Judging from the plot, it is orthodox to use Wusheng to play the role. As for using Laosheng to play this role, Lao Tan was the originator. However, Lao Tan was originally a Wusheng, so his performance was naturally outstanding. Contemporary actors do not have Lao Tan's Wugong, so their performance cannot avoid the ridicule of imitating Dong Shi. The compiler believes that Xiao Long Peng, a famous actor in the Jianghu troupe, is very popular in this play. His precision of reciting and singing, his excellence in martial arts, and his subtlety and appropriateness of expression are truly unique. For example, when Zhang Xiu surrendered to Cao Cao, Cao Cao entered the city to watch his soldiers perform their formations. Xiu bowed his head and walked because he was overwhelmed with emotion. He then bumped into Xu Chu and Dian Wei. Here, Xiao Long Peng is humble, respectful, and flattering to Dian Wei, as if he cannot overcome his fear; and he only nods slightly to Xu Chu, showing a perfunctory attitude. Because Xiu only fears Dian Wei in Cao Cao's company. He does not want to lower his head to show weakness to Xu Chu and others. However, the usual actors have the same expression when they bump into each other. When Xiu heard that his aunt Zou Shi was robbed and went to Cao's camp to inquire, Cao Cao casually ordered Zou's maid Chunmei to serve tea. When common actors perform this, they must try their best to describe their shock and anger. In fact, Xiu should naturally have a shocked and angry expression when he suddenly sees this situation, but given Cao Cao's suspicion, Xiu would never dare to show it on his face. Therefore, Xiao Long Peng only reveals a hint of shock and anger at this time to show that he does not care at all, which is quite empathetic and reasonable for Zhang Xiu. In the past twenty years, I have seen famous actors perform this play, and he is far superior to them! Compared with Ying Xiu back then, he is naturally inferior, but being confined to the Jianghu troupe is all the more unfortunate for his mother!

### Talking about Dan

— Aiping Studio Owner

Dan is divided into Zhengdan Huadan, Lao Dan, Caidan, and Wudan. Zhengdan is also called Qingyi, also known as Qingshan, which represents virtuous women and chaste women. The most important thing is singing, such as Sun Furen in "Sacrificing to the River", Wang Chun'e in "Teaching Son", and Luo Fu in "Sangyuanhui".

Huadan is what Kunqu opera calls Tie, which represents adulterous and fierce women, known for their reciting and acting. The Minmen, Wanxiao, and Daoma categories, such as the Dan roles in "Xiaoshangfen", "Shuangyaohui", and "Damianjiang", "Dinghuazhuan" and other plays, are all Wanxiao Dan. As for the Dan roles in "Mashangyuan", "Mukezhai" and "Hongniguan", they are Daoma Dan, dancing with swords and guns, with beautiful posture as the main focus, and it is not necessary to be good at martial arts fighting, so they are classified as Huadan. Those in between Qingyi and Huadan are called Huashan, such as the princess in "Visiting Mother", and the maid in "Hongniguan", which represent intelligent and open-minded women. Singing is the same as Qingyi, reciting and acting are close to Huadan, dignified and fluent, combining both. It was created by Wang Yaoqing and continued by Mei Lanfang, and the name Huashan was discovered in the opera world.

Lao Dan is for playing women under 100 years old and over 40 or 50 years old. They must have the appearance of an old woman to be dressed appropriately. For example, Liu Qingti in "Huayoushan" and Xu Mu in "Xu Mu Scolding Cao" are all examples. Only the late Gong Yunfu was good at playing this role. Such as Chen Shi in "Sending Relatives and Performing Rites", Ma Shi in "Tielianhua", Dou Shi in "Puqiushan", as well as Song Mama in "Four Jinshi" and Liu Matchmaker in "Shiyuzhuo", etc., this item is mostly played by Wen Chou concurrently, and in terms of roles, it should still be included in the Dan category.

Wudan emphasizes martial arts skills, somersaults, pole climbing, and the use of props are all essential skills. The appearance does not have to be as beautiful as Daoma, the figure does not have to be as charming as Daoma, but the fighting skills must be proficient and the falls must be stable. There are things that Daoma cannot match, this is why Dan is martial arts. Such as "Huachunyuan", "Sanchakou", "Qingshishan", "Shuiman Jinshan" and other all Wudan plays.

Xiao Li took Jin Shishi into the dance hall. Xiao Li said to him, "You are really a monster. When you enter the dance hall, you don't dance yourself, and you don't allow others to dance!" But Shishi said, "Really, coffee is not stimulating enough!"

Xiao Mei said, "Xiao Chen accompanied me to find a doctor who can perform surgery... I was worried... I saw a man with a college student's air扶持ing a lady out of the doctor's operating room, the lady's face was as pale as a dead person, Xiao Chen ran out as soon as he saw it..." It turned out that the woman was Xiao Chen's fiancée, his lover!

Mother Mi said to Mi Mi, "Hmph, you don't have money, but you have money to open a room... You, you specialize in supporting gigolos, poor college students, hmph! Mi Mi, you have simply forgotten why you are called Mi Mi!"

Mi Mi replied to her: "Because the family has no rice to eat, you forced me to be a dancer! You treat me like rice for you to eat!"

Xiao Li: "Have you looked under the sofa?" Xiao Li: "Look, there's a dead person underneath!"

Xiao Li: "Haven't you seen it in the newspaper? "A person opened a room and went to sleep. In the middle of the night, a beautiful dead body of Miss Kudeng rolled out from under the sofa."

Dingxiang: "Discontinuation"! "Suicide Mi Mi, now committed suicide out of world-weariness, with no relationship to anyone, Mi Mi's last words."

Li: "Haicai, it's over, my first place is over!"

Game 15: Abstract of the Endgame

Red goes first to draw

How to play will be revealed tomorrow

According to the cannon and double bishops can draw a single chariot, and the horse and double bishops cannot draw, which means that the horse is inferior to the cannon. The chariot cannon and double bishops can draw double chariots, and the chariot horse and double bishops can also draw, which means that the horse is not inferior to the cannon. Although the horse and double bishops cannot draw a single chariot, it is not easy to break it. The chariot horse and double bishops can draw double chariots, but it is very difficult to draw. The reason why the cannon and double bishops and the chariot cannon and double bishops can draw is that they have a certain drawing method, so it is easy. The reason why the horse and double bishops cannot draw a single chariot is that there is no certain drawing method, so it is broken. The chariot horse and double bishops also have no certain drawing method, but the result is a draw, which shows that the theory of chess is extremely mysterious and difficult to understand. Just like this game, from the surface, it seems that the double chariot side can win, but the result is a draw. There are many smart people among the readers. I hope to study it further. If the one holding the double chariots can have a winning method, this garden has a small reward to help with your Yaxing.

Lao Tan Asks About Liu Hongsheng's Cause of Death

Besides the three major schools of Wang, Tan, and Sun, there was also the Liu school in the world of old male roles. The founder of the Liu school was the cripple Liu Hongsheng. This man did not pay much attention to pronunciation when singing, and because he had a venereal disease that ruined one of his legs, he was naturally not good at stage movements. When it came to armed combat, it was even more out of the question. Therefore, Liu the Cripple's performances could only be listened to for his voice and tone. As for the plays he knew, there were only a few. Therefore, the people of Tianjin compiled a saying for him, saying, "Three executions, one exploration, and then bumping the stele and running away." This meant that for the first three days of his engagement, he would always perform "Execution of the Son," "Execution of Su," and "Execution of the Yellow Robe." In between, he would perform some less important plays like "Perfect Return to Zhao," "Golden Water Bridge," and "Beating the Golden Branch." At most, he could perform for twenty days without repeating the same play. Then he would have to turn around and reheat leftovers. When the theater posted "Bumping the Stele," he would have to make himself scarce.

Listening to opera is originally supposed to be enjoyable. To meticulously study the sounds and pronunciations is only for about one or two percent of the audience. Therefore, Hongsheng, relying solely on his smooth and natural voice, did indeed cause a sensation for a time. During his peak, even Lao Tan was somewhat afraid of him. In the past, Lao Tan also often performed "Execution of the Son," but the lyrics were different from Liu the Cripple's. Because this play didn't have much in the way of stage movements and was all about using falsetto, fancy tunes, and showcasing vocal skills, it suited Liu Hongsheng's style perfectly. Therefore, he stopped performing this play. Who knew that Liu the Cripple wouldn't be so polite and slowly competed with Lao Tan in singing "The Lost Empty City and the Execution of Ma Su." Fortunately, the Tan school's "Three Explorations" had different expressions, different tones of voice, and different recitations. These few skills were something that no one could learn. Others performing this would either be too dull or too fiery. Lao Tan's kind of expression was truly refined and indescribably wonderful. To discuss the wonders of Tan's "Three Explorations" will require a dedicated article in the future, because it will require at least one or two thousand words to explain thoroughly, so it will not be discussed here for the time being. Although Hongsheng wanted to use this play to compete with Lao Tan, the result was always disappointment.

The "Since That Day" section of the "Hongyang Cave" play, sung in Erhuang Kuaiban, is also Lao Tan's unsurpassed masterpiece. This play emphasizes both singing and acting and is a famous Tan school play that emphasizes flavor rather than showcasing vocal skills. Unexpectedly, Hongsheng overestimated himself and actually took up this play as well. Lao Tan was really a little annoyed. When Hongsheng posted that he would be performing the play, Lao Tan also hid in the crowd to eavesdrop, wanting to see what Liu the Cripple was good at. What kind of magic did he have to attract so many people? Think about it, in the theaters of Beijing, who didn't recognize the old man? Even the seasoned opera fans knew him.
