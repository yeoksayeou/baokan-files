### 日承認華軍 攻入包頭

Japanese Acknowledge Chinese Army's Attack on Baotou

北平 Beiping

The Japanese authorities here today received foreign journalists and stated that Baotou, the terminal of the Ping-Sui Railway, has now returned to Japanese hands. The Japanese side acknowledged that the Chinese army had once penetrated the city. According to a certain Japanese military officer, on the 19th of this month, Chuan Zuoyi's 35th Division, numbering 12,000 men, launched an attack on Baotou from three directions: north, south, and northwest. The Japanese side had already detected the Chinese plan in advance and therefore took the necessary measures to lure the Chinese army into Baotou and then attack its flanks. By dawn on the 20th, the Chinese army had been lured to the north by the Japanese army, which then dispatched a force from the west to attack the Chinese flanks. However, the Chinese army had already routed the Inner Mongolian forces guarding the north gate of Baotou and entered the city through the Shuicheng Gate. The Japanese army then allowed them to enter and deployed Japanese troops stationed in Anbei and Guyang to attack the rear of the Chinese army. Unexpectedly, the Chinese army put up extremely strong resistance. Therefore, on the 21st, the Japanese side used its air force to heavily bomb the Chinese army concentrated in one corner of the city. By the 22nd, the Chinese army could no longer hold its ground and retreated to the mountains to the west. (Dispatch of the 29th, United Press)

重慶 Chongqing

Qualified Chinese observers here predict that the future situation will be characterized by: (1) No immediate prospect of peace; (2) The Japanese will launch a final, large-scale offensive in the hope of breaking Chinese resistance next year. It is believed that the Japanese efforts will focus on the following: (A) Advancing from Hankou towards Guangdong Province, with the aim of completely seizing the Yuehan Railway line, with two columns converging at Hengyang; (B) Advancing from northern Hunan along the west bank of Dongting Lake via Changde; (C) Advancing north from Nanning towards Liuzhou and Guilin; (D) Advancing west from Nanning towards the Yunnan border; (E) Advancing west from Hankou towards Shashi and Yichang; (F) Advancing west from Xinyang towards Xiangfan; (G) Attempting to seize Xi'an from Shanxi Province. However, it will be very difficult to advance along any of these routes, as a strong Chinese army, anticipating any possible Japanese action, has concentrated in key locations.

According to investigations last night, Japanese aircraft bombed Lanzhou three times this week, resulting in approximately one hundred civilian deaths. On Tuesday, 101 Japanese aircraft participated in the bombing, 98 on Wednesday, and 90 on Thursday. During each Japanese air raid, the Chinese and Japanese air forces engaged in fierce battles in the skies over Lanzhou. On Tuesday, three Japanese bombers were shot down by the Chinese side. Reporters witnessed two of the three Japanese aircraft smoking and crashing to the ground. Chinese officials stated that the wreckage of the third Japanese aircraft had also been found. In the air battle on Wednesday, four Japanese bombers were shot down. During this bombing, foreign property was not damaged, and there were no foreign casualties. The damage suffered by the Chinese side on Thursday was the most severe. Japanese aircraft dropped dozens of heavy bombs. Previously, Japanese aircraft had also dropped many incendiary bombs, causing fires in several places, but they were extinguished by firefighters and soldiers. Many Chinese and foreign homes were destroyed in this raid. Although there were a hundred civilian deaths, given the indiscriminate bombing by the Japanese army, this can only be considered a small number.

### 何以救濟飢寒交迫之窮黎

How to Relieve the Destitute Suffering from Hunger and Cold

Since the beginning of winter this year, the weather has been clear and there has been no snow or severe frost. However, there have been two high-pressure systems, one at the end of last month, which froze over fifty people to death, and one around the winter solstice, when the temperature was not as low as last time, but one hundred and two people died of cold in five days. This is only according to reports from some charitable organizations, and the actual total is likely to be higher. Such a large number is unprecedented. Winter is still long, how can we not feel compassion?

The reason why there were fewer deaths on the streets in previous harsh winters was that the poor, lacking food and clothing, still had the opportunity to receive relief. Before the war, Zhabei held annual cooked gruel distributions, Nanshi had shelters that provided various forms of accommodation, and various charitable organizations widely distributed clothing and rice, and gave out silver and money, thus saving many lives. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, many more refugees have been displaced, suffering from hunger and cold on the roads. Fortunately, people from all walks of life cared deeply, providing shelter and donations. Therefore, even in severe cold and heavy snow, deaths from freezing were rare. Now, the time since the local fighting is longer, and many shelters have closed due to financial reasons, environmental reasons, or other unexpected reasons. Refugees, on the other hand, either have not been able to return home because order in the interior has not been restored, or their homes have been destroyed and their property has been lost, or the roads are long and traffic is blocked. As a result, those who have nowhere to go are bound to wander the streets again, living as beggars. Furthermore, copper coins have disappeared and there is a shortage of small change, making it difficult to even beg for money. Some people call for pity all day long, but cannot obtain enough money for even a single steamed bun. Even if they manage to get something, prices have soared, and the cost of living is one or several times higher than it was six months ago. What they earn is still not enough to alleviate hunger. Moreover, with the price of rice skyrocketing, even middle and lower-class families can barely afford to eat a few grains, which makes it conceivable that the amount of leftover food available to beggars has decreased, making it even more difficult to beg for food. The reason why the human body can resist cold and preserve life is that it has clothes to block out the cold and prevent heat loss, and it has food to generate body heat to resist the cold. Therefore, having food but no clothes does not lead to immediate death, not because one is full, but because the food generates heat like fuel, which is enough to resist the cold from outside. Having clothes but no food, although the body's heat will eventually be exhausted, can still resist the cold for a period of time. Now, with both clothes and food depleted, and no way to seek help, what other option is there but to await death? Alas! Death from starvation on the roads is not without cause.

Relief this winter is more difficult than in previous years because prices are too high. The essentials are food, clothing and shelter, now a foot of cloth costs thirty or forty cents, and a picul of rice costs thirty or forty yuan. The concessions are isolated and overcrowded, and every inch of land is occupied by warehouses and houses. Is there any spare land available for building shelters to protect from the cold? If we simply allow the wind, snow and cold to strike without offering assistance, even a body of iron and stone would not be able to withstand it, let alone the poor who are suffering from hunger, cold, poverty and illness. If we still want to provide relief, where will the huge amount of money come from? We have often heard those in charge of relief work say that the problem is not a lack of funds, but a lack of effective management. However, in reality, there are often cases where projects are interrupted because of large expenses and difficulties, or where projects are not undertaken because funds cannot be found. It is important to know that relief work is not solely the responsibility of those in charge of it. Compassion is inherent in everyone, and it is a responsibility that the public should fulfill. Although it is said that "to bestow widely on the people and relieve the masses is a task that even Yao and Shun would find challenging," if everyone had the heart of Yao and Shun, even tens or hundreds of millions of people could become Yao and Shun. Then, how difficult would it be to bestow widely and relieve the masses? The problem is that those with power are unwilling to exert it, and those with money are unwilling to contribute it. They only know themselves and not others, only their families and not society, only enjoyment and not mutual help. The rich are unkind, and they become accustomed to extravagance and callousness. However, what is the point of being wealthy? In the extreme, the downfall of the Qin, Han, Sui, Tang, Yuan, and Ming dynasties was all due to uprisings by starving people. In more recent events, patrols and police are stationed at various locations to maintain local security closely, but recently, a robbery occurred on Rosen Road in Shanghai during the day. This shows that the right to survive is contested by both the rich and the poor. Only when the masses can maintain their minimum standard of living can the affluent enjoy their prosperity. Therefore, starting from each individual unit and developing into mutual assistance among the masses, it is especially necessary to provide relief to the poor in years of famine.

When we speak of relief, of course, we mean providing assistance. Therefore, we hope that those with wealth and power will contribute their resources and efforts. We also hope that various charitable organizations will uphold their original intentions, broadly solicit donations, and provide clothing and rice. Given this year's rice prices, providing cooked gruel cannot be delayed. Choosing places where poor people gather to distribute gruel will achieve a great deal. Shelters should also be set up immediately, not only to provide shelter to the poor and prevent them from freezing and starving, but also to reduce the number of people driven to desperation by hunger and cold, thereby contributing to public safety. At the same time, it is also a way to maintain commerce and industry under order. To alleviate the burden on those who rely on their labor and small-scale citizens, it is best to establish fair prices and stabilize grain prices. All of this falls within the scope of what should be done for relief. The end of the year is not far away, and the harsh winter is approaching. We earnestly hope that people from all walks of life will abandon their selfish views, embrace compassion, and prevent the number of people freezing and starving to death on the streets this winter from setting a new record. This would truly be the fortune of the poor and the blessing of society.

Tokyo Authorities Exert Utmost Effort to Prevent Deterioration of US-Japan Relations; Negotiations to Renew Commercial Treaty Currently Uncertain; US Remains Silent, Hoping Japan Will Repent

東京 Tokyo

Japanese Prime Minister General Nobuyuki Abe told reporters last night, "I have not received detailed information on the conversation between US Ambassador to Japan Grew and Foreign Minister Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura. I do not know if Ambassador Grew has stated whether or not a treaty-less period will occur. Although Grew generally believes that after the expiration of the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty, Japan will not necessarily face any difficulties. The US government's suggestion not to impose discriminatory import taxes on Japanese goods is an action solely decided by the US, and not agreed upon by both parties. The reopening of the Yangtze River was originally scheduled to take place in October, but was only announced today due to various military relations. This decision was the result of political considerations. The Japanese government is studying various ways to cope with the deterioration of commercial relations between Japan and the United States, but will do its best to eliminate the occurrence of such a situation. The government has not discussed any special treatment, but wants to amend the old treaty to suit the current new situation." (Dispatch of the 29th, United Press)

Although Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, returned here on Tuesday, many people hope that he will initiate an embargo on arms and raw materials to Japan. But in fact, Pittman has not yet attended meetings or met with any journalists. In the past, Pittman would immediately meet with journalists when there was a problem. Now that Pittman's attitude is so ambiguous, many people suspect that his silence is requested by the government. (Dispatch of the 29th, United Press)

Suma continued that US Ambassador to Japan Grew does not plan to hold talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Admiral Nomura in the next ten days, but will hold several meetings before the expiration of the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty. "I hope to achieve constructive results at that time," Suma said. Suma also said that Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Shigenori Togo is negotiating very smoothly with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov. The Japanese government will instruct Togo to urge the Soviet Union to conclude a fisheries agreement, or at least reach a temporary solution. Suma also said, "The report that France and Japan signed a non-aggression pact is not true." (Dispatch of the 29th, United Press)

### 日本經濟命脈 操於美國掌握 日貨輸美近年激增 美工商業感受威脅

Japan's Economic Lifeline Is in the Hands of the United States; Japanese Exports to the US Have Increased Sharply in Recent Years; American Industry and Commerce Feel Threatened

紐約 New York

The Wall Street Journal recently reported that the 1911 US-Japan Commercial Treaty will expire on January 26 of next year. The Japanese government is making efforts in various aspects to prevent the consequences that this may cause. This can be seen in the country's recent transportation of a batch of soybeans produced in "Manchukuo" to Germany via the Siberian Railway, and the country's Mitsui Trading Company ordering 25,000 tons of potassium chloride from Germany to replace American products. The fact that Japan's economy relies on US business can be seen in the official statistics released by the country's Ministry of Finance. In the eight months before the outbreak of this European war, Japanese goods exported to the United States averaged approximately 39.4 million Japanese yen per month, accounting for approximately 26% of the country's total export trade with countries outside the Japanese Yen bloc. By September and October of this year, Japanese goods exported to the United States had increased significantly, averaging approximately 79 million Japanese yen per month, accounting for as much as 44% of the country's total export trade with countries outside the Japanese Yen bloc. Also, in the eight months before the outbreak of the European war, Japanese imports of American goods averaged approximately 82.4 million Japanese yen per month, accounting for approximately 48% of the country's total imports from countries outside the Japanese Yen bloc. Although the total value of American goods imported in September decreased to 65.55 million Japanese yen, it increased to 82.6 million Japanese yen in October, still accounting for 44% of the total imports. The main reason for the increase in the total number of Japanese exports to the United States since September, ranging from 14% to 18%, is the depreciation of the Japanese yen and the increase in the price of Japanese goods. For example, Japanese silk exported to the United States averaged 27.3 million Japanese yen per month in the first eight months of this year, but increased to 55.2 million Japanese yen in September and October, i.e. after the outbreak of the European war, due to the soaring price of silk. Other examples include sugar products exported to the United States, which averaged 1.4 million Japanese yen per month before the war, but increased to 4 million Japanese yen after the war. Tea exports averaged 400,000 Japanese yen per month before the war, but increased to 1.4 million Japanese yen after the war. Bleached cotton averaged 400,000 Japanese yen per month before the war, but increased to 1.1 million Japanese yen after the war. Vegetable oil averaged 500,000 Japanese yen per month before the war, but increased to 1.2 million Japanese yen after the war. Camphor averaged 85,000 Japanese yen per month before the war, but increased to 400,000 Japanese yen after the war. In addition, Japanese cotton fabrics exported to the United States totaled only 3.6 million square yards in October of last year, but increased to 8.8 million square yards in September of this year, and increased to over 9 million square yards in October. The American textile industry is therefore very dissatisfied, saying that after the large-scale import of Japanese textiles, the domestic products have become unprofitable due to competition. Therefore, they all hope that the US-Japan Commercial Treaty will expire in order to regain profits. Other industries that have been affected by Japanese imports are also the same. In short, since the outbreak of the European War, Japan's economic reliance on US trade has become increasingly severe, but at the same time, American industry and commerce have felt threatened as a result. It can be seen that Japan is in favor of maintaining the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, while the United States is not. (Dispatch of the 28th, Havas)

### 阿部首相 猶圖戀棧 對議員公意 決置諸不理

Prime Minister Abe Still Seeks to Cling to Power; Decides to Disregard the Public Opinion of the Diet Members

東京 Tokyo

Although Diet members from various factions in the House of Representatives have expressed their distrust of the Abe Cabinet, Prime Minister Abe believes that the government's sole mission is to complete the task of handling the incident. Therefore, the Prime Minister has stated that the current Cabinet will not resign for any other reason, and has clarified its determination to move towards the goal of handling the incident. The Prime Minister also believes that there will be changes before the House of Representatives is reopened, so he stated that it is not necessary to hold five-party leaders' meetings to seek understanding. Prime Minister Abe trusts the promises of the heads of the political parties as a result of holding five-party leaders' meetings twice. Furthermore, China is about to establish a "new central government," and the incident will enter a new stage. Japan's domestic problems are inseparable from this. In this serious period, the current Cabinet cannot resign due to domestic problems. The Prime Minister's belief is completely based on his trust in the heads of the political parties.

### 蘇日漁約談判 困難重重 蘇方要求清償 中東鐵路價款

Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement Negotiations Face Many Difficulties; Soviet Side Demands Payment of the Chinese Eastern Railway Price

莫斯科 Moscow

Japanese Ambassador Togo is about to continue talks with Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov to discuss the fisheries issue. The Japanese side originally hoped to conclude a long-term fisheries agreement with the Soviet Union, but the Soviet side demanded that the Japanese side pay the final installment of the Chinese Eastern Railway price as a prerequisite for concluding this agreement. On the Japanese side, only the payment of 1.7 million US dollars in principal and interest is allowed. The opinions of the two sides are still far apart, and it will take a long time to negotiate before there is a chance of agreement. At this time, the Japanese side may retreat a step and ask for the extension of the current temporary fisheries agreement for one year, which seems more likely to succeed.

### Ministry of Communications Revises Telegraph Rates

Chongqing: The domestic telegraph rate schedule in China was last revised in the 25th year of the Republic of China. At that time, the telecommunications economy was still relatively prosperous, and the rates set were relatively low. Since the War of Resistance, the cost of telegraph materials has increased sharply, and expenditures have been enormous. In order to remedy the telecommunications economy and reduce subsidies from the national treasury, the Ministry of Communications intends to appropriately increase domestic telegraph rates, taking into consideration the burden on the public and maintaining the principle of telecommunications economic viability, so as to provide financial support. The new rate for ordinary telegrams in Chinese plaintext is revised from 7 cents per word within the province and 10 cents per word inter-provincially to 12 cents per word within the province and 18 cents per word inter-provincially. Urgent telegrams will be charged double this rate, official and military telegrams will be charged one-half of this rate, and press telegrams will be charged one-quarter of this rate. The Ministry has submitted this plan to the Executive Yuan for approval and will implement it uniformly starting from the first month of the 29th year. (29th dispatch)

### American Residents in Tianjin Subjected to Severe Restrictions; Japan and Italy Attempt to Force the United States to Yield; Japanese Military Spokesman Makes Clear Statement; Anglo-Japanese Negotiations in Tokyo Also Reach Stalemate

Tianjin: The Tianjin American Chamber of Commerce's move to request the Japanese authorities to remove obstacles in the Tianjin Concession is welcomed by the British here. The reaction of Tokyo to this is attracting much attention. When American Ambassador Johnson recently came to Tianjin, he had multiple discussions with local Americans and the Japanese Consul-General. The current action of the American Chamber of Commerce must be a direct result of the American Ambassador's visit to Tianjin. It is said that when the American Ambassador stayed briefly in Tianjin, he paid much attention to the blockade issue, because the somewhat special treatment previously enjoyed by American residents in Tianjin from the Japanese authorities has recently encountered increasingly severe restrictions. British and American people are now facing the same obstacles. Recently, a well-known American carpet merchant was forced by the Japanese at the inspection point to unfold a new carpet on a muddy road for inspection. Such incidents are too numerous to mention. Americans are extremely indignant about this, believing that the Japanese are deliberately imposing this kind of new treatment on Americans, which is related to the stage of disputes in US-Japan relations caused by the issue of renewing the commercial treaty. It is believed that the Japanese hope to use the restrictions imposed on Americans as a tool to force the US government to yield. The remarks made by Honma, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin, to reporters recently, further prove the Japanese intention to pressure the US government. Honma said briefly that if Washington has an attitude of renewing the treaty, the Japanese will do their best to facilitate the interests and businesses of Americans, but if there is no such goodwill attitude, the relations between the two countries will further deteriorate, starting with the termination of the treaty. Honma and Japanese spokesman Nagai repeatedly advised people to be patient when answering questions about when Tianjin can return to normal. Honma also said that the negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo have reached a stalemate, so it is impossible to say exactly when Tianjin can return to normal. What needs to be resolved at present is indeed the silver deposit issue. Although he does not know what developments there are between Tokyo and London, he expects that there must be progress at present. (29th Reuters dispatch)

Tianjin: According to what US Consul General in Tianjin, Gauss, told United Press reporters, the Japanese military commander in Tianjin, Honma, said that if the United States imposed an embargo on military supplies and raw materials to Japan, Japan would declare war on China. He believes that this does not need to be taken seriously. As for Honma's claim that the Tianjin American Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the US State Department and US Ambassador to Japan Grew with malicious intent towards Japan, this is also incorrect. In fact, the Tianjin American Chamber of Commerce did not send any such telegram to any party. The telegram sent by the Tianjin American Chamber of Commerce was nothing more than seeking improvement in the situation in North China. (29th United Press dispatch)

### Britain, France, and Germany Actively Engage in Naval Shipbuilding Competition; Germany Completes Two of Four Battleships; British Shipbuilding Plan Emphasizes Defensive Power

London: The naval shipyards of the Entente countries and Germany are now competing to build warships in an atmosphere of intense secrecy, working twenty-four hours a day without stopping, seven days a week without rest. The competition in shipbuilding has never been so intense in centuries. It is reported that Germany is currently building at least four 35,000-ton battleships, two of which have recently been launched, namely the "Bismarck" and the "Tirpitz". Approximately at least one more ship is about to be built. These battleships are equipped with eight 15-inch guns and other auxiliary guns, and carry four aircraft with a take-off runway, with a speed of 30 knots. However, it is widely believed that although naval personnel have made every effort to rush the construction of the "Bismarck" and "Tirpitz", they may not be completed by the end of 1940. Germany is also currently building two aircraft carriers and at least five 10,000-ton cruisers. At the same time, it is also accelerating the production of submarines to compensate for losses. Germany is focusing particularly on new submarines, so the production rate of large warships will inevitably be delayed. Britain currently has five 35,000-ton new battleships nearing completion, namely the "King George V", "Prince of Wales", "Duke of York", "Jellicoe", and "Beatty". Each is equipped with ten 14-inch new-style guns, with a range longer than the old-style 15-inch guns, and special attention is paid to defense against air raids. To prevent submarine threats, the iron plates at the waterline of the new ships will be 16 inches thick, and the speed will be 30 knots. Larger battleships with 16-inch guns and very high speeds are currently being planned. The keels of the "Lion" and "Temeraire" have already been laid. In addition, many smaller warships are being produced to deal with German submarines. The output of these warships is very high, so the navy believes that the progress of Germany's accelerated production of submarines is not a cause for concern. (29th Reuters dispatch)

Berlin: Since the news of the scuttling of the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" spread around the world, the German Naval Command has received many donations from Germans at home and abroad to rebuild new warships. The Naval Command yesterday issued a public announcement expressing its gratitude to the donors and notifying all parties that future donations can be paid directly to the Deutsche Bank in Berlin. (29th Reuter dispatch)

### Another British Battleship Hit by German Torpedo; Three Sailors Killed

London: The British Admiralty has acknowledged that a battleship of the "Queen Elizabeth" class was hit by a torpedo from a German submarine in the sea west of Scotland, killing three sailors. At the same time, the hull of the ship was also considerably damaged. (29th United Press dispatch)

Berlin: According to a public announcement here today, a British "Queen Elizabeth" class battleship was hit by a torpedo from a German submarine west of Scotland. There are four battleships of this class in Britain, namely the "Malaya", "Warspite", "Barham", and "Queen Elizabeth", all with a displacement of 31,000 tons and main guns of 15-inch caliber. (29th United Press dispatch)

### US Plans to Build Super Battleship; Supported by Naval Experts

Washington: It is generally believed that the recently proposed US Navy plan to build 65,000-ton battleships has received the support of some senior naval officers. It is reported that these naval experts are prepared to agree with the suggestion that at least four such extraordinary warships should be built in the next few years. They believe that the cost of building each of these warships will be approximately 32 million pounds, and that the construction and operation of these battleships will be more economical in terms of expenses compared to ordinary 35,000-ton to 40,000-ton battleships. It is rumored that because the US Navy admirals have long had the habit of printing blueprints of their ideas for future warships, the design and detailed content of these 65,000-ton battleships have been prepared.

### Three Tons of Stolen Armaments Recovered in Dublin

### German Official Announcement of Statistics on Ships Sunk; A Total of Two Hundred and Seventy-Nine Ships Reaching Over One Million Tons

Berlin: The German authorities today officially announced the total number of ships sunk by Germany since the beginning of the war up to October 20. It is claimed that a total of 134 British ships were sunk, totaling 526,169 tons, 12 French ships were sunk, totaling 64,751 tons, and 78 neutral ships were sunk, totaling 258,209 tons, for a total of 224 ships totaling 849,137 tons. The above have been confirmed by Britain, France, or neutral countries, and their ship names have also been ascertained. The second category is those that are generally determined to have been lost, including 14 British ships totaling 46,425 tons, 4 French ships totaling 17,233 tons, 20 neutral ships totaling 37,240 tons, and 17 ships of unknown nationality totaling 79,600 tons, for a total of 55 ships totaling 180,498 tons. Together with those that have been confirmed, the total is 279 ships totaling 1,029,635 tons. On the other hand, during the same period, only 18 German ships were sunk, totaling 128,689 tons, of which only one was sunk by enemy forces, and the rest were scuttled to avoid being captured. The authorities stated forcefully that this estimate has a high degree of accuracy, because in addition to the fact that the first category has been confirmed by all parties without any doubt, the reliability of the second category is also extremely high, and most of them have factual evidence but the ship names are unknown. Other ships that have been "sunk or may have been sunk" and those that have been damaged by bombing have not been included. Even British ships that sank after hitting mines have not been included, because the British Admiralty has not acknowledged them as losses. However, the losses of British, French, and neutral ships still reach more than one million tons, which is an alarming number. (29th Reuter dispatch)

### The Pope Addresses the King of Italy; Wishes the Warring Nations to Establish Justice and Peace; The Holy See and Italy Abandon Their Suspicions and Deeply Rejoice; The United States Values Roosevelt's Attempt to Communicate with the Pope

Rome: When the Pope repaid his visit to the King of Italy yesterday, he delivered a speech in the throne room of the Quirinal Palace, saying briefly, "We are in this palace today and wish to express our joy again for the visit of the King and Queen of Italy to the Vatican. We are particularly pleased that the old suspicions between the Holy See and the Italian state have been eliminated. Although the Vatican and the Quirinal Palace are separated by the Tiber River, they are now connected by peace and common religious beliefs. The waves of the Tiber River have washed away the past suspicions. We pray to God to bless the King of Italy and his royal family, the leaders and ministers of the Italian government, and all those present, so that the peace that is currently maintained through the wisdom of its rulers will make Italy even greater and stronger, and respected by the world, or even encourage the warring nations to understand each other in the future and establish a new, better, and lasting order based on fairness and Christian benevolence." (29th Reuters dispatch)

London: The Times Washington correspondent claimed that Mr. Utley of the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations recently made a speech at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, saying that if Europe made peace today, the Allied countries would be committing suicide. Mr. Utley predicted that the European war would continue in 1940, and all parties, including neutral countries, would suffer losses. There is no hope for peace, and he asserted that the early peace movement of neutral countries would not succeed. Mr. Lippmann also made a speech, saying that President Roosevelt's letter of December 23 and the Pope's speech at the Catholic Academy both imply that our war will continue, because Hitler and Stalin are still not prepared to accept the conditions necessary for peace, namely, compensating for the great mistakes they made in Poland, Finland, and Czechoslovakia. The correspondent pointed out that President Roosevelt mentioned that the day when the above-mentioned small countries regained their freedom would be like slaves regaining their freedom and destroying those who conquered them with the fire they set themselves. However, Mr. Lippmann's opinion is similar to that of the Pope, believing that the extent of future compensation should not be decided solely by the defeated. Unless the rest of the world participates in it to jointly restore the pre-war procedure, the world will not be stable forever. Therefore, there is a need for a procedure for relief, reconstruction, and spiritual comfort, which has never been done in history. The correspondent ended by saying that President Roosevelt is now sending Mr. Taylor to Rome to prepare in advance, and intends to use the power of American churches to achieve the same goal. President Roosevelt also hopes that the Congress convened next month will transcend party politics and complete this supreme goal. (29th Reuters dispatch)

Washington: According to news here today, President Roosevelt's recent peace movement, such as the meeting with the leaders of the three religious groups in the Americas and the appointment of Taylor as the US representative to the Vatican, is well aware that the current call for peace cannot reduce the belligerence of all parties in Europe. However, according to those familiar with current affairs, the opportunity for peace may appear at the end of next year. If peace talks are proposed at present, they will not be welcomed by the warring parties. Britain and France will never stop before their goals are achieved. Talking about peace at present is tantamount to approving the actions of the National Socialist Party, and if the Western European countries cease fighting at present, it is tantamount to approving the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland and its future aggression against Romania and Hungary. (29th United Press dispatch)

Paris: Newspapers here have commented on the Pope's visit to the King of Italy, saying that at a time when barbarism is controlling the whole of Europe, this move is nothing less than a revival of the Christian spirit. The Petit Parisien reported that Italy and the Vatican have united to defend Western Christian civilization and resist the opportunity of evil forces to add cruelty and barbarism to the world. (29th Reuters dispatch)

Vatican: Responsible officials here recently announced that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will visit Pope Pius XII at the beginning of the new year and hold talks with Cardinal Maglione, the Secretary of State of the Holy See, around January 5. After the signing of the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and the Italian government on February 11, 1929, this is the second time that the Italian Prime Minister has visited the Pope. (Prime Minister Mussolini visited the late Pope Pius XI in 1932). Vatican officials commented that the King of Italy and the Pope have just visited each other recently, and Prime Minister Mussolini will come here again. Their relationship is certainly far-reaching, which shows that the Holy See wants to develop friendship with the Italian dynasty and establish a good relationship with the fascist regime.

### The Philippines' Important Position to the United States

Washington: According to retired US Naval Intelligence Officer Ballaston, speaking to captains today, the US possession of the Philippines can greatly reduce the defense burden of the US Army and Navy, and at the same time will not increase the risk of war, because the US cannot be without the Philippines if it wants to protect US interests in the Far East.

### British Government Decides to Implement Food Distribution System in Practice; Consumption of Sugar and Meat is Restricted to Save Foreign Exchange for National Defense Needs

London: The British food rationing system was originally scheduled to be limited to butter and bacon only from January 8, but according to official announcements, sugar and meat will also be subject to restrictions. The use of sugar will be limited to 12 ounces per person per week, starting on January 8. As for the amount of meat rationing and the date of implementation, it will be announced later. Domestic livestock and locally produced meat will be managed from January 15. Minister of Food Morrison recently published an article saying that the meat rationing is not very different from normal needs. Items such as liver, heart, kidney, tongue, and sausages are not restricted, and the supply of fish is not affected. As for the sugar restriction, there are separate appropriate arrangements for candy factories, and additional supplies are also provided for those who make fructose and jam, at a rate of three pounds of sugar for every two pounds of citrus. It is estimated that after the implementation of the sugar restriction, the normal consumption of sugar can be reduced by 25%. The government's purpose is to increase domestic sugar production. This year's domestic sugar production is estimated to be 475,000 tons, compared to 289,000 tons last year, and it can be further increased next year. Most of the food that Britain needs to ration now relies on supplies from overseas. The amount of distribution depends on the current import procedures, and the import procedures depend on the tightness of foreign exchange and ship tonnage. The need for imported goods such as armaments and raw materials is considered more urgent than food, so it is necessary to restrict foreign food so that foreign exchange and tonnage can be used primarily for national defense needs. Anyone who saves on foreign food also makes an important contribution to the country's war effort. (29th Reuters dispatch)

### US Army Increases Airborne Troops by Fifty-Two Squadrons to Strengthen Defenses in Various Regions

Washington: The War Department has recently issued an order to add 52 air brigades to strengthen the defenses of the Caribbean Sea, the Pacific Ocean, and the American continent. Once formed, they will be stationed in the Panama Canal Zone, the Hawaiian Islands, and the Alaskan Peninsula. (28th Havas dispatch)

Washington: Attorney General Murphy recently gave a speech saying that the Federal Criminal Court is scheduled to open on January 2 of next year to investigate espionage activities and various acts of sabotage on the east and west coasts of the United States, as well as the work of agents of foreign governments. In addition, the House "Dies Committee" is responsible for investigating un-American activities, and has recently made new discoveries regarding German espionage activities, which have been collected and published. Therefore, the investigation work of the Federal Criminal Court can be facilitated. (28th Havas dispatch)

### Belgian Prime Minister Explains Financial Plan; War Expenses Increase; Burden on the People; Sacrifices Must be Made

Brussels: Belgian Prime Minister Pierlot spoke in the Senate yesterday, saying that in order to maintain the huge cost of keeping the army mobilized, any amendments to the financial proposals that have reportedly been passed by the House of Representatives that would reduce the new tax revenue contained in the financial proposals cannot be accepted by the government. He fears that as a result of the mutual slaughter between neighboring countries, Belgium will not have to shed blood, but income and funds will be lost. Now there are still some people who are indifferent or unaware of the current danger. It should be known that continuing to keep the army in a state of mobilization is a costly matter, and this cost must be compensated for by domestic debt, because borrowing from foreign countries is too expensive, especially in the current situation. Prime Minister Pierlot concluded by saying that the sacrifices that everyone in Belgium must make are quite significant, but this is necessary for national security. (29th Reuters dispatch)

### Relations Between the Vatican and Italy

In the Middle Ages, politics and religion were not separate, and the Pope held immense power. A papal ban could cause even monarchs to tremble. This is a far cry from the Pope's authority today, which is limited to moral and spiritual influence. The Pope's residence is called the Vatican, located near St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, separated from the Quirinal Palace, the residence of the Italian King, by only a river. Pope Pius XII recently paid a formal visit to King Umberto III of Italy with great pomp. Newspapers gave the event extensive coverage, calling it a major historical event. The following is a brief account of the relationship between the Vatican and Italy, outlining the significance of this news.

In the 19th century, European nationalism flourished, and the unification of Italy gradually came to fruition. The Pope's territory was reduced to Rome alone, protected by French troops. In 1870, the Franco-Prussian War broke out, and French King Louis III ordered the troops stationed in Rome to head north to fight. Italian troops then seized the opportunity to enter Rome. Pope Pius IX offered only token resistance before opening the city gates and allowing Italian troops to occupy Rome. The Italian House of Savoy then established its capital there. The so-called "Roman Question" in Italian history thus became a source of discord in Italian national life.

Pope Pius IX was deeply dissatisfied with this policy of force and decided to voluntarily confine himself to the Vatican Palace, refusing to set foot on Italian-occupied land to demonstrate his protest. To appease the Vatican, the Italian parliament passed the "Law of Guarantees," stipulating that St. Peter's Basilica, the Vatican Palace, the Lateran Palace, and the Castel Gandolfo be considered the Pope's hereditary property, with the Pope enjoying sovereignty. The law recognized the Pope's inviolability and granted him the right to send envoys to various countries and receive envoys from other countries. In other words, Italy recognized the Pope's status as equivalent to that of a foreign head of state. However, Pope Pius IX remained unmoved, declaring that he did not recognize the House of Savoy and forbidding Italian Catholics from participating in politics. In 1905, Pope Pius X allowed Catholics to participate in parliamentary elections, and relations between the two sides eased slightly.

When the Fascist Party came to power, it understood that conflict between politics and religion within a country could weaken national unity. As Mussolini said, this problem was like a thorn in one's side, causing unease. Therefore, he initiated negotiations with the Vatican. After two and a half years, three agreements were finally signed on February 11, 1929. The first was a political treaty, stipulating the international status of the Vatican. Italy recognized the Vatican's absolute independence and sovereignty over Vatican City, and recognized Vatican City's permanent neutrality and inviolability. The Vatican also recognized the Kingdom of Italy. The second was a concordat concerning religious affairs, stipulating that Italy recognized Catholicism as the sole state religion. The third was a financial agreement. As of yesterday, Pope Pius XII's visit to the Italian King completely eliminated the grievances of the past 69 years. (K)

### Severe Earthquake in Turkey Causes Tens of Thousands of Casualties; Fifty-One Towns and Ninety Villages Reduced to Rubble; Black Sea Snowstorm Hampers Relief Efforts

Istanbul (From our correspondent) A heavy snowstorm is raging on the Black Sea today, causing all shipping to be suspended. Authorities in various ports are feeling uneasy as many ships have yet to arrive and their whereabouts are unknown. An intense earthquake struck Anatolia, Turkey, yesterday. The heavy snowstorm on the Black Sea today makes it a double disaster. (Havas, 29th)

Istanbul – It is estimated that the earthquake in Anatolia, Turkey, on Wednesday caused over 25,000 casualties, mostly deaths. According to the Turkish "Haber" newspaper, in the Erzincan region alone, out of a total population of 60,000, there were 42,000 casualties, most of whom have perished. It is reported that 51 major towns and 90 villages have been reduced to rubble. Railway traffic remains blocked due to collapsed bridges. The extremely cold weather is adding to the suffering of the victims. The temperature has dropped to 30 degrees below zero. Many homeless people have frozen to death due to the lack of shelter. The town of Kiğı has been almost completely destroyed. Another violent tremor shook the disaster area yesterday. Donations are pouring in from all parts of Turkey to help the victims. (Reuters, 29th)

Ankara (Turkey's Capital) – The number of deaths and injuries caused by the severe earthquake in Anatolia Province yesterday is far greater than generally expected. Most of the houses in the villages have collapsed. For example, in the village of Suçan, out of 200 houses, 150 were destroyed, and half of the residents were killed or injured. The railway line from Sivas to Erzurum has been damaged in several places. The heavy snowfall in the disaster areas is further hindering relief efforts. The shelters for the victims are already overcrowded. Although relief teams have rushed food to the disaster areas, it is still a drop in the bucket. In addition, there were also earthquakes in Bitlis and Izmir yesterday, but fortunately the damage was minor. (Havas, 29th)

Istanbul – According to Turkish official reports, the number of deaths in the earthquake zone in eastern Turkey is actually over 50,000. In the Erzincan province alone, at least 60% of the population has been killed or injured by the earthquake. This is the worst disaster in Turkish history. The casualty figures for cities with a population of over 10,000 have not yet been determined. As for Erzincan city, with a population of only 60,000, the number of casualties is already over 30,000. The epicenter of the earthquake appears to be in the Black Sea, but the disaster area covers over 25,000 square miles. It is reported that the areas most affected are Sivas, with a population of 70,000, Erzincan, with a population of 60,000, Kiğı, with a population of 20,000, and Pülümür, with a population of 1,500. Corpses are everywhere, and the homeless refugees are seeking shelter in the severe cold and snow. At the same time, because both the railways and highways have been destroyed by the earthquake, it is very difficult for the rescue teams to reach them. (United Press, 29th)

Ankara (Turkey's Capital) – Although the exact number of deaths and injuries caused by the severe earthquake in Anatolia Province yesterday is unknown, it is believed to be in the tens of thousands, making it an unprecedented catastrophe. In addition, it is winter, and the climate there is extremely cold, often dropping to 30 degrees Celsius below freezing. The general public is without food, clothing, or shelter, and their plight is unimaginable. According to the latest news, the epicenter was in the ancient city of Erzincan. The city had previously suffered an earthquake in 1784. This disaster is even more severe, and it has been almost completely destroyed. Only the military camp remains standing, while the rest of the city has collapsed. Of the 16,000 residents, the majority are either dead or injured, with some even dying in their beds before they could get up. In the nearby town of Çayırlı, over 1,000 houses were also destroyed, and 1,500 residents were killed. The local mosque, a famous historical site, was also destroyed by the earthquake. Upon hearing the news, the government immediately took various relief measures, established a committee to raise donations, and dispatched rescue teams to the disaster area. (Havas, 29th)

### Severe Cold in Central Europe; Danube River Freezes; Traffic Halted

Budapest – It is expected that if the current severe cold weather continues for another two days, traffic on the Danube River will likely be temporarily suspended, as the river has already begun to freeze.

The country has also ordered 300 giant steam excavators for digging trenches, and a batch has already arrived on the island. In addition, 25,000 tons of Argentine beef purchased by Britain, as well as various other military supplies, are stored in warehouses on the island, awaiting shipment. Large reconnaissance bombers are also arriving in a steady stream, and dozens of them are often loaded onto ships for transport to Europe." (Havas, 29th)

As for the number of shells manufactured by British factories, it has now doubled, and it has increased tenfold compared to the last European War. In addition, the number of firearms manufactured next year is also expected to exceed the average number during the last European War. (Havas, 29th)

### Soviet Troops Repeatedly Fail to Conquer; Continue to Bomb with Aircraft; Moscow Resumes Telegraph Censorship

Helsinki – It has been a month since the Soviet army began its invasion of Finland, but the Finnish army, with its defensive lines composed of forests, icy wilderness, and frozen lakes, still holds firm. This line is 1,200 miles long, seven times longer than the Maginot Line. In the Suomussalmi area, the Finnish army can hear the sound of Soviet machine guns and rifles. (United Press, 29th)

Helsinki – Soviet aircraft began operations again this morning along the southern coast of Finland, dropping several bombs in the area of Kotka. Alarms have been issued in both Porkkala and Hanko. (Central News, 29th)

Helsinki – An air raid alert was issued in Helsinki last night at 11:30 PM. Residents were awakened from their dreams. Soviet aircraft took advantage of the moonlight to invade Helsinki, attempting a night attack, but the dense ground fog obscured the targets, so the Soviet aircraft failed to find their bearings and left. The alert was lifted 37 minutes later. (Haitong, 29th)

Moscow – The headquarters of the Leningrad Military District announced that there were no significant developments on the front lines on the 28th. (TASS, 29th)

Moscow – The Information Bureau of the Soviet Foreign Ministry announced last night that the Soviet Union will resume censorship of news telegrams starting at 10:00 PM today. News censorship began during the 1917 revolution and was abolished this March when Molotov succeeded Litvinov as Foreign Minister. It is not yet known whether the censorship will include telephones and letters. Previously, telephones were not subject to censorship. (United Press, 29th)

Helsinki – The General Headquarters has issued a war report stating that our troops in the northeast of the town of Lieksa launched an offensive and drove the Red Army back to the border line. The territory lost four weeks ago has now been recovered in one fell swoop. Our troops, since the 13th, have launched an attack from the town of Lieksa towards the town of Värtsilä in the Soviet Union's Kumo region, and have already entered the area near the village of Inari on the Soviet border. They are still fighting the Red Army in that area today. Soviet aircraft were quite active yesterday, not only bombing our army's positions on the front lines, but also flying into our interior and indiscriminately bombing. They dropped many bombs on the cities of Raahe and Tampere, causing many civilian casualties. They also flew low in certain areas, strafing civilians with machine guns. A total of nine were shot down by our side yesterday. As for our country's aircraft, they were also very active, conducting reconnaissance flights on the front lines and bombing military targets behind the Red Army's lines. (Havas, 28th)

### The Chongqing Military Commission Announces the War Situation for the Week of the 22nd to the 28th

Chongqing – A spokesman for the Military Commission, discussing the war situation from the 22nd to the 28th, stated that the Japanese troops on all fronts have been repeatedly attacked by our troops recently, suffering heavy losses, and have fallen into a state of panic. They have launched a large-scale "rumor offensive" in an attempt to cover up their defeats. These tricks have already been refuted by me in my talks with Chinese and foreign reporters yesterday, so I will not repeat them here. As for the important war achievements this week, I will list them as follows: On the Nanning-Pinyang, Yishan-Wuxuan, and Nanning-Qinzhou routes, our troops have continued to advance and attack together in recent days, intensifying their efforts. The strategic and tactical objectives of the mopping-up operation on the outskirts of Nanning and the campaign to deplete the Japanese main force have achieved great success. The Japanese are trapped in an isolated city, in a state of panic. A force of over 3,000 attempted to break through and spy westward, attempting to attack Longzhou and Zhennanguan. We surrounded and severely attacked them near Yashuitan (south of Longzhou), annihilating more than half. Taking advantage of the victory, we pursued and recaptured Suilu. Only about 300 remaining Japanese fled back to Nanning. The Japanese army on the Yuehan Railway, under the cover of dozens of aircraft, launched a large-scale northern attack. One route, with over 10,000 troops, advanced north along the Yuehan Railway via Yuantan, suffering heavy casualties along the way due to our interception. They crossed the Pajiang River at one point, but were routed after a fierce attack. There is currently no trace of the Japanese army on the north bank of the Pajiang River. Another route, with 5,000-6,000 troops, advanced north from Taipingchang towards Liangkouwei, where they were ambushed by us near Conghua, resulting in countless Japanese deaths. They are currently engaged in battle near Liangkouwei. Another route, with 7,000-8,000 Japanese troops advancing from Zengcheng towards Longmen, reached the Zoutanwei area. After a bloody battle by our troops, Japanese corpses littered the field. Over 3,000 Japanese were killed in that area this week, with twice as many wounded. Many Japanese were captured, and countless horses, 17 machine guns, 4 artillery pieces, rifles, and other military supplies were seized. In addition, over 50 Japanese armored vehicles were destroyed. Zhongxiang, the largest Japanese stronghold east of the Xiang River in Hubei Province, has been surrounded by us to this day. The counties of Jingshan, Yingcheng, Yingshan, Anlu, and Suixian are also completely under our control. In total, over 5,000 Japanese were killed along the Jing-Zhong, Han-Xuan, and Xiang-Hua routes this week, and countless spoils were captured. In the areas of Tongcheng and Xianning in southern Hubei, the Japanese are strengthening their fortifications, attempting to put up a last-ditch fight. The war on the northern front of Hunan and Jiangxi has reached a stalemate. Jing'an, an important Japanese stronghold in northern Jiangxi, was once captured. Over 2,500 Japanese have been killed there this week. On the southern front of Henan, we have launched a full-scale offensive, achieving victory after victory. After successively recapturing over a dozen outposts on the outskirts of Xinyang, the Japanese in Xinyang have been surrounded. On the night of the 22nd, a unit of our troops, acting swiftly, took advantage of the bright moonlight to attack the eastern gate of Xinyang. The Japanese were caught off guard, and we broke through the gate and charged in, engaging in fierce street fighting. We also dispatched troops to set fire to several Japanese military warehouses. As of the evening of the 23rd, the street fighting was still ongoing. At the same time, a unit of our troops attacked the Japanese army in Donggang and Fengwan, south of Changtaiguan, and recaptured Donggang in one fell swoop, killing countless Japanese. The connection between Xinyang and Changtaiguan has now been severed by us. Zhongmu in eastern Henan was lost on the 23rd and recaptured. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. Taking advantage of the victory, we are advancing towards Kaifeng. The Japanese army in Zhucheng, Shandong Province, has been advancing north towards Linyi in recent days, where they were intercepted by us in the area of Wangxuanzhuang, east of Linqu. The entire Japanese Kizawa Brigade, numbering over 1,000, has been annihilated by us. Also, a unit of the Japanese army in Laiwu launched a two-pronged northern attack on the 21st, one route attacking the area near Dongxi Taitou via Tusikou (north of Tusikou), and the other route attacking Gumen Village (east of Boshan) via Chencun (northeast of Tusikou). They were severely damaged by our separate attacks and are still engaged in fierce fighting. As for our troops in Shanxi and Suiyuan, they have launched separate attacks in the past week and have also recovered many areas. In southeastern Shanxi, our troops recaptured Licheng County on the morning of the 23rd, killing many Japanese. The remaining Japanese troops fled towards Changzhi and Dongyangguan. Our troops launched a fierce attack, recapturing Dongyangguan on the morning of the 24th and attacking the north gate of Changzhi. Another unit is pressing on Changzi and Tunliu, annihilating countless Japanese. In southern Shanxi, our troops have been conducting mopping-up operations in the Yicheng, Jiang County, Anyi, and Yuncheng areas, killing over 2,000 Japanese and seizing a large amount of supplies. The war is progressing very smoothly. In the Suiyuan area, our troops attacked Baotou at noon on the 21st, resulting in fierce street fighting. The Japanese army sent reinforcements from Guyang, after Daqingshan, numbering over 1,000, in over 60 armored vehicles, tanks, and cars. They were ambushed by our troops at Qianhoudianzi, and the entire Japanese army was annihilated without a single escapee. All the vehicles were completely destroyed. On the same day, over 100 Japanese were annihilated in Kundulun. Together with the over 1,300 Japanese annihilated in Baotou, a total of over 2,500 Japanese were killed, marking a major victory in the annihilation war in Suiyuan. Taking advantage of the victory, we launched a fierce attack on Anbei. After a heroic hand-to-hand battle, the remaining Japanese troops fled, and Anbei was recaptured. Another elite force attacked the Dengkou railway station on the Sui-Bao line and is now pressing on Guyang and Sazhou, intensifying its attacks on various places in Guisui. In addition, recently, the puppet troops in various places have taken advantage of the Japanese defeat and collapse to revolt, and there has been a continuous stream of those who have responded to the National Army. In addition to the over 3,000 puppet troops of Peng Ziwen's unit last week, there are also the over 500 puppet troops of Huang Jiazan's unit in Guangzhou, the 600-700 puppet troops in Suixian, the over 1,000 puppet troops of Wang Yueqiong's unit in Xinyang, the 700-800 puppet troops of Zhu Liangchen and Liu Yingtang's units in northern Jiangxi, and the several thousand puppet troops of Ding Guowu, Ding Wendou, and Wang Kecheng's units in eastern Hubei. A unit of the Japanese army in Qianjiang, central Hubei, even secretly discussed surrendering to us, but the matter was exposed and failed. Based on the above facts, the day of the Japanese collapse cannot be far off. (Dispatch on the 29th)

### Guangzhou Merchants Manipulate Paper Currency; Japanese Army Seizes Opportunity to Issue Military Notes; People Suffer More Under Oppression; Japanese Military Notes First Issued in the Amount of Five Million Yuan

Guangzhou Correspondence: It has been over a year since Guangzhou fell. During this time, due to manipulation by treacherous merchants and gangsters in the financial sector, paper currency crises have occurred repeatedly. Moreover, after each crisis, one type of paper currency would cease to circulate. The reasons given for their cessation were ridiculously absurd and completely irrational. Until recently, the only paper currencies that could be used in the market were the one-yuan, five-yuan, and ten-yuan notes issued by the provincial bank, as well as their one- and two-cent fractional coins, and the one-cent fractional coins issued by the municipal bank. All other paper currencies were unusable. Until the middle of last month, the market began to discriminate against the ten-yuan notes issued by the provincial bank, and eventually refused to accept them, with market transactions valuing them at only 70%. At the same time, there was also a crisis involving the five-yuan notes issued by the provincial bank. By the 1st and 2nd of this month, they were also taken out of circulation, leaving only one type of paper currency issued by the provincial bank – the one-yuan note – as the only one that could be used in the market. The amount of five-yuan and ten-yuan notes issued by the provincial bank stored in the market was quite large, while the amount of one-yuan notes was small. Since the market was using the one-yuan notes as the single currency standard for circulation, how could there suddenly be so many one-yuan notes available for circulation? The difficulty and obstruction were self-evident. For a time, people were in a panic, and most of the buying and selling transactions had stopped. During this ten-day period, at least half of the stores had to temporarily close down due to their inability to manage their finances. The puppet organization therefore issued a proclamation ordering that the five-yuan and ten-yuan notes issued by the provincial bank must be used as usual, and anyone who disobeyed would be arrested. Several dozen money changers from the Thirteenth Factories were also arrested one after another, causing the entire money changing industry to go on strike, and the crisis became increasingly serious. By the 4th, the arrested partners of the money changers had been released, and they had also complied with the order to use the five-yuan and ten-yuan notes as usual, and resumed business as usual starting on the 6th. This crisis could have been resolved, but the market's discrimination against the five-yuan and ten-yuan notes remained the same, and the situation was even worse. Of all the past paper currency crises, this one had the most severe economic impact and the greatest losses for the people. In previous paper currency crises, if the circulation of a certain type of paper currency was stopped, that type of paper currency could still be sold on the market at a certain discount to exchange for funds for turnover. But this time was different from previous paper currency crises. The five-yuan notes (the ten-yuan notes were even more absolutely unusable, worth only 60%) could still be used in circulation on the surface, but secretly they had already depreciated to about 60%. Thus, the five-yuan note became the main unit of market transactions, with all buying and selling transactions calculated in five-yuan notes. The one-yuan notes and the one- and two-cent fractional coins became scarce commodities that could be traded for a premium, a true epitome of financial chaos. If you took a five-yuan note to a money changer to exchange for one-yuan notes or one- or two-cent fractional coins, the money changer would definitely say that they had no small change to exchange. Even if you wanted to exchange for silver dollars, you couldn't get them. If you insisted on exchanging, then the only option was to exchange for Japanese military scrip. For every 100 yuan of five-yuan notes, after adding a 22% premium, you could exchange for 44 yuan of Japanese military scrip. Each yuan of Japanese military scrip was only worth 1.5 jiao of fractional currency on the market. Therefore, every 100 yuan of five-yuan notes could only be exchanged for 66 yuan of one-yuan notes. Market transactions, such as buying miscellaneous goods or drinking tea and eating snacks, all used Japanese military scrip as the calculation standard for exchanging change, and would definitely not give change in one-yuan notes or silver dollars. In this way, not only had prices already increased, causing great suffering, but buying and selling transactions were also subject to double losses. If you used a five-yuan note to buy something, the change would definitely not be given in one-yuan notes or silver dollars, but would be calculated using Japanese military scrip with an added premium of 8% or more. If you then used the Japanese military scrip to exchange for one-yuan notes, each yuan of Japanese military scrip was only worth 1.5 jiao of fractional currency. In short, if you used a five-yuan note, whether you were buying something or exchanging money, you could not directly exchange for one-yuan or jiao notes. You had to indirectly exchange for Japanese military scrip, and then buy and exchange for one-yuan or jiao notes. The losses and damage in this roundabout process were extremely large. The impact of this paper currency crisis on social prices and personal lives was undoubtedly huge, and it also had a serious impact on the food problem. This year's late rice harvest was originally abundant. In the middle of last month, each yuan could buy 6.25 to 6.5 jin of rice, and each dan of unhusked rice was worth no more than 10 yuan and six or seven jiao of fractional currency. When this paper currency crisis occurred, everyone believed that storing grain was more secure than storing paper currency, as the market price of paper currency was constantly changing. Therefore, they competed to buy and store grain at high prices. Now, the price of white glutinous rice has risen to 12.5 to 12.6 jiao per dan, and snake glutinous rice has also risen to 12.2 to 12.3 jiao. If you used a five-yuan note to buy grain, each dan would cost three yuan more, and some rural areas even refused to accept them. If you used a five-yuan note to buy rice, you could only get 3 jin per yuan. If you used a one-yuan note to buy rice, you could get about 5 jin per yuan. The calculations for other prices and transactions were the same. Therefore, in order to absorb the resources of Guangdong Province and control the economy of Guangdong Province, the Japanese military authorities decided to take advantage of this opportunity to issue a new type of military scrip in Guangdong Province, amounting to five million yuan. Its design was announced yesterday and it will be put into circulation next month. However, the amount issued will continue to increase at any time in the future.

### Many Poor People in Wuxi

Wuxi Correspondence: Since our county suffered from the war, there are many poor people. Now that winter has arrived, they are plagued by hunger and cold. Xu Chong, Xue Mansheng, and others have raised 1,200 paper dollars to purchase white rice and cook it into dry porridge to distribute to the poor to alleviate their hunger. However, it is not widespread enough, and the original funding cannot be sustained. Currently, Director Jiang Yanghan and others have sent a special letter to Shanghai, appealing to Feng Yunchu, Tang Xinghai, Xue Xuehai, Wu Kunniu, Wang Yaochen, Cheng Bingruo, Wu Guan and other Wuxi natives in Shanghai to solicit funding. The original letter stated: "Heaven despises the Chinese people, who have suffered a terrible calamity. Wails of misery echo across the land, and empty stomachs are pitiful. Moreover, prices are soaring, making it extremely difficult to make a living. Firewood is as expensive as cassia, and rice prices are like pearls. Poor people block the roads by the Lianghong Creek, and orphans and widows cry by the side of the Furong Lake. Kind-hearted gentlemen in the county are jointly planning to provide porridge to help the poor, but it is like using a cup of water to put out a burning cartload of firewood, and many are still left out and regretful. Moreover, the existing funds will soon be exhausted. Even the most skilled housewife cannot cook without rice, and wise men sigh with compassion. To leave the virtue unfinished would be a waste of a good name. Thinking that most of the kind gentlemen from our county live in Shanghai, these refugees are not merely the subject of Zheng Xia's drawings, but are impoverished people in the suburbs, only seeking the charitable deeds of Qiu Gong. We have appointed Gan Zhiqing and Jiang Yinghan as fundraising committee members to present this letter on behalf of the starving people. We humbly request your generous help to accomplish this righteous cause, gathering a large sum of money to save the poor."

### Japanese Troops Withdraw from the Countryside of Suzhou

Suzhou Correspondence: Although our county has fallen into Japanese hands, the southeastern water towns are still under the control of the Chinese army. Therefore, in the spring of last year, the Jiangsu Provincial Government appointed Shen ×× as the Magistrate of Wuxian County. After taking office, Shen followed the instructions of the Provincial Government and worked from designated locations, sometimes following the Chinese army to command operations, and thus made considerable contributions. Recently, the Japanese troops in the surrounding countryside have been forced to withdraw. In order to understand the conditions of each township that has been devastated, he, together with Section Chief Wei, went to inspect the surrounding countryside on the fifteenth of this month. Whenever he arrived in a township, he comforted the farmers and proclaimed the virtues of the central government. He also explained in detail the recently promulgated government regulations on tax exemptions, which greatly pleased the general farmers.

### Tight Financial Foreign Exchange; Speculation Towards Term Lending Activities; Swap Spreads Further Widened; Profitable Arbitrage Transactions Flourishing

Yesterday's foreign exchange market: the exchange rates remained unchanged when the exchange was listed. In the unofficial market for British and American exchange rates, the situation suddenly turned around after a gradual relaxation. It was rumored in the market that there would be circulating bonds issued, and the large seller Hong Kong Electric suddenly stopped supplying to the exchange, and it was reported that HSBC was acting on behalf of Hong Kong to cover its short position, aggressively buying 150,000 pounds of British gold. Therefore, those who intended to buy in began to seize the opportunity, and their lineup was very strong, resulting in a strong reaction. As a result, British rates tightened to 0.09375, and American rates softened to 0.1875. Initially, they opened at the same level, but then Easy Access and other institutions began to sell out. However, HSBC's appetite was surprisingly strong, and the Japanese Bank Sassoon and the Chinese Chamber of Commerce also aggressively bought in, causing the market to become tight and soft. Soon, buying interest also rose among the foreign firms. Although HSBC slightly resold far-month contracts at that time, it took advantage of the momentum to raise prices. Therefore, by around 10 o'clock, rates had tightened to 4 shillings, 6 pence, 5/8 and 7 yuan 5/8. The market then became calm, and there was a period of stability. Until noon, Hong Kong Electric finally sold off a little, and the situation slightly recovered. By noon closing, the rates were 4 shillings, 6 pence, 6/8 and 7 yuan 6/8. In the afternoon, the rates continued to tighten slightly, but the evening closing remained the same as the noon closing. The swap spreads widened again. According to the evening closing, British gold was 125 away, and American exchange was 0.21875 away, with a combined monthly interest rate (excluding them) of over 2.85%. This was because most operators were looking to shorten their positions and engaged in term lending activities, and wealthy individuals began to engage in arbitrage.

HSBC Completed a Large Number of Transactions

In the morning, London's large contracts for both near and far terms rebounded by 0.1875. The price of silver in New York remained the same, and the price of gold in London remained stable. The exchange rates against the US, Shanghai, and France remained the same. The US rate against the British rate was up by half a point, unchanged against the Shanghai rate, and up by 0.125 against the French rate. The central exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling prices in the morning: British gold at 4 shillings, 7 pence, 5/8, and American exchange at 7 yuan 5/8, with no change from the previous closing. After the opening, the Japanese Zhenggin Bank took the lead in buying in, and Sassoon and other Chinese merchants also completed transactions. HSBC then came back to buy in, and the market immediately tightened and softened. At that time, British gold was trading at 4 shillings, 7 pence, 4/8, and American exchange at 7 yuan 4/8. HSBC announced that the listing price remained unchanged, and the white silver balance tax was announced to be up by 1.25 points. Subsequently, foreign firms also followed suit and completed purchases. Although HSBC profited by reselling far-month contracts, it continued to raise prices, and the market continued to soften. By 10:15, the rates had tightened to 4 shillings, 6 pence, 5/8 and 7 yuan 5/8. The situation then stabilized due to balanced supply and demand. Until near noon, Hong Kong Electric slightly sold off the far-month contracts first, and the situation slightly recovered. By noon closing, the spot selling prices of banks were British gold at 4 shillings, 6 pence, 6/8 and American exchange at 7 yuan 6/8, with British rates tightening by 0.09375 and American rates softening by 0.1875 compared to the morning opening.

The Afternoon Market Was Still Quiet

The afternoon market was extremely quiet, and trading was slow. Only Chinese merchants came to buy in the far-month contracts, and the American exchange rate softened slightly. At that time, the spot prices were 4 shillings, 6 pence, 5/8 and 7 yuan 5/8. After that, the situation returned to normal because Easy Access and other outside firms still had the intention to supply. By the evening closing, the spot selling prices of banks were British gold at 4 shillings, 6 pence, 6/8 and American exchange at 7 yuan 6/8. The British gold rate for the following month was only 4 shillings, 5 pence, 1/8, and the American exchange rate was only 7 yuan 4/8. As a result, the British rate was tighter by 0.09375 and the American rate was softer by 0.1875 compared to the previous day's spot rates. The British rate for the first month was lower by 0.15625, and the American rate was higher by 0.25.

### Popular Sentiment Leans High: Gold Market Rises in Reaction; Tightening Exchange Rates the Main Cause

Yesterday, the spot gold market saw a bullish surge. The main reason was the tightening exchange rates, which led to rising expectations. Local Chinese merchants absorbed a considerable amount, and Hong Kong merchants and foreign banks were also very active. As a result, the market reversed its previous downward trend, rising by as much as sixty-four yuan in a single day. This offset the sixty-five yuan decline over the previous four days, leaving only a one-yuan difference. The morning opening was at four thousand one hundred and twenty yuan, already twenty-five yuan higher than the previous day's close. The reason was a softening of foreign exchange rates and initial purchases by money changers. However, a sudden sell-off by a certain gold dealer caused a temporary decrease in buying interest, resulting in a small fifteen-yuan drop. But due to the strong exchange rates, securities firms immediately bought in, and foreign banks also entrusted a certain bank to buy on their behalf. Furthermore, Hong Kong merchants were secretly active from time to time. By the afternoon, the price had surged to four thousand one hundred and sixty-seven yuan, closing at four thousand one hundred and fifty-eight yuan in the evening. Total trading volume for the day was over two thousand taels. Gold jewelry shops raised their prices by five yuan, while customs gold remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Rises Sixty-Four Yuan

From the morning opening, the situation looked good. A certain money changer initially bid four thousand one hundred and five yuan to buy. Later, as exchange rates softened, more buyers entered the market. When the market opened at 9:30 AM, it was already twenty-five yuan higher than the previous day. A money changer bought ten taels from a gold dealer for four thousand one hundred and twenty yuan. At that time, a certain gold dealer suddenly offered to sell, and buying interest decreased, causing the market to weaken and fall by fifteen yuan. The gold dealer sold twenty taels to the money changer for four thousand one hundred and five yuan. The price was once quoted at four thousand one hundred yuan, but there were no transactions. Subsequently, as exchange rates continued to tighten, securities firms began to buy in, and the gold dealer stopped selling. As a result, the price rebounded. Soon, a certain bank and money changer also began to buy on behalf of their clients, causing the price to surge to four thousand one hundred and forty-eight yuan. At this point, another money changer took the opportunity to aggressively sell over a hundred taels. The buyers were momentarily stunned, and the price dropped by eleven yuan. The money changer sold twenty taels to the gold dealer for four thousand one hundred and thirty-seven yuan. Afterwards, a certain bank and money changer renewed their buying spree, driving the price up by another thirteen yuan. A gold dealer, a money changer, and a certain bank jointly bought over two hundred taels from a certain money changer, all at four thousand one hundred and fifty yuan. Later, as exchange rates softened, many individual investors took profits and sold. At the same time, jewelry shops were also willing to sell, causing a gradual decrease of twenty-three yuan. A jewelry shop sold ten taels to the gold dealer for four thousand one hundred and twenty-seven yuan. Near noon, a certain bank started buying again, and the gold dealer took the opportunity to raise prices, causing another eleven-yuan increase. The money changer bought twenty taels from the securities firm for four thousand one hundred and thirty-eight yuan, which became the midday closing price. The afternoon opening was two yuan higher. A jewelry shop bought ten taels from the gold dealer for four thousand one hundred and forty yuan. Subsequently, the price fell back by two yuan. The money changer sold twenty taels to the gold dealer for four thousand one hundred and thirty yuan. Later, as exchange rates tightened slightly, and securities firms continued to buy aggressively, and it was rumored that Hong Kong merchants were still secretly accumulating, the price soon rose by twenty-nine yuan. The money changer bought twenty taels from the gold dealer for four thousand one hundred and sixty-seven yuan. After the purchase, exchange rates softened again, and a certain spot gold dealer took profits and sold, causing a small seventeen-yuan drop. The gold dealer sold twenty taels to the money changer for four thousand one hundred and fifty yuan. Later, the money changer returned to buy in, driving the price up by another eight yuan, and bought twenty taels from the securities firm for four thousand one hundred and fifty-eight yuan, which became the evening closing price. As a result, the price rose sixty-four yuan compared to the previous day, with a total fluctuation of sixty-two yuan. The selling price of the spot gold dealer's own-brand gold was several yuan higher than the spot gold price, while the buying price was twenty yuan lower. The current standard gold price was over fifty yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was little trading activity.

Jewelry Gold Prices Rise Five Yuan

Yesterday, due to the lack of improvement in the situation, floating positions were released, causing a reversal. The downward trend gradually intensified. With the end of the year approaching, many parties sought to close positions for interest-earning purposes, which was also a reason for bearish sentiment. Today is the last day, with only half a day of trading. The market will reopen on the fourth day of the new year, so there will be no significant changes. The opening yesterday was similar to the previous day, but buying interest was stronger, pushing prices lower step by step. Class E bonds broke through eight yuan, reaching the bottom.

### Cotton Yarn: Buying Spree Returns to the Yarn Market; Speculation Rises Before Closing

After several days of sluggish trading, the yarn market rebounded at closing yesterday. The reason for this was said to be the reduction in exchange rates, which sparked a buying spree, causing the market to advance step by step. However, actual sales remained sluggish and weak, with very weak procurement power in southern China. Nevertheless, market sentiment was very strong and bullish.

The morning opening of the yarn market was extremely cold and lifeless, due to a lack of real demand and a lack of vitality in the overseas cotton market, with a narrow range of fluctuations. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 737 yuan, with little change from the previous day.

As for the factories, Japanese merchants slightly expanded their purchases, but the amount purchased was not large. Chinese factories only bought parcels and did not make purchases.

### Pudong Chinese Guerrillas Ruthlessly Suppress Puppet Troops; Xu Chengde and Gu Shouxin's Forces are Strong and Their Soldiers are Brave

Since Ding Xishan, Fan Gencai and others betrayed and renamed themselves as the puppet "Peace and National Salvation Army," the Commander of the Third War Zone of the Chinese Army, in addition to ordering their arrest, also ordered Xu Chengde of the Second Detachment and Gu Shouxin of the Third Detachment, who are currently serving as guerrillas in Pudong, to suppress them. Since last week, after gradually eliminating them, they have occupied Lujiahui, the base of Fan Gencai. Fan had nowhere to retreat, so he took refuge in Xinchang Town, which is in the defense zone of Zhang Miaogen. Three days ago, Gu Shouxin's troops attacked Xinchang and completely wiped out Fan's troops and Zhang's squadron. Gu Shouxin originally belonged to the old troops of the 45th Brigade. His strength is strong and his soldiers are named. There are not many soldiers in his troops, but they are all good at fighting. He has been reused by the Chinese authorities.

### Increasing Terrorist Activities: Another Kidnapping Yesterday - Printing House Owner Mao Shujun Abducted, Several Book Proofs Confiscated

Yesterday morning at 9:40 AM, a deep blue white-licensed car with the license plate number 18143, containing three Japanese individuals and one Chinese individual, sped towards Xie Feng Printing Company at 1228 Foch Road. The occupants of the car immediately alighted and went straight into the back room of the company. They ordered a man sleeping on the bed to get up, seized him, took him downstairs, and drove off in the car. After the news was revealed, the police paid close attention and immediately began investigating. It was later learned that the abducted man was named Mao Shujun, a native of Ningbo, 34 years old, who previously worked at the Commercial Press. After the August 13th Shanghai battle, he established the printing house to make a living, and the business was quite successful, employing dozens of workers. One account said that before Mao was forced into the car and driven away, the men first copied various books that the company was printing, including the second issue of "International English Selections" commissioned by the New Intelligence Bookstore, and the proofs of "Literary Anthology" commissioned by the Kaiming Bookstore. Then they abducted Mao. The case is currently under investigation by the police.

The English-language newspaper, The China Press, reported that armed personnel from the Japanese military intelligence department carried out the second kidnapping in a week within the Public Concession this morning (the 29th). The victim was Mao Shujun, the owner of the Xie Feng Printing Company at 1228 Foch Road. It is evident that the Japanese terrorist activities are increasing. Last night (the 28th), a team of Japanese individuals abducted a Chinese person in the British defense area and attempted to drive out, but were stopped by British soldiers. Details are as follows: At 10:15 AM this morning, five Japanese individuals in plainclothes, armed with weapons, broke into the Xie Feng Printing Company on Foch Road in the Jing'an Temple district, arrested the owner, Mr. Mao, and seized several book plates. They then drove away in a vehicle belonging to a certain Japanese transportation company. The seized plates were for printing one Chinese and one English book, the English book titled "International English Selections" and the Chinese book titled "Literary Anthology." After the Japanese put Mr. Mao in the car,

they drove west, likely heading to their "headquarters" located on a Concession road within the British defense area. The abduction of another Chinese person by the Japanese happened last night at 6:00 PM at the intersection of Brenan Road and the railway. A car traveling from the east to that location was stopped by British sentries. The British sentries, seeing several Japanese individuals and a Chinese person being held in the car, informed the Japanese that they had no right to take a Chinese person through there.

The British sentry post ordered the Japanese to return the way they came. The car used by the Japanese belonged to a Mr. Sun, a resident of Avenue Edouard VII. Mr. Sun did not return home last night, and it is likely that he was also kidnapped by Japanese special agents. Because the people in the car claimed to be plainclothes military police, the British sentry allowed the car to return. Furthermore, on Christmas Eve, seven Japanese individuals kidnapped a Chinese person in the Zhabei district. The Chinese person

was startled and screamed, and a Chinese constable went to intervene, but was forced back by the seven Japanese individuals wielding guns. There has been no further development in this matter. The car used by the seven Japanese individuals belonged to a Japanese man named Nishihara, a resident of Tiantong Road. It is widely believed that Nishihara is connected to the special intelligence department, but Nishihara claims that he has not used the car recently. The Japanese authorities have promised to cooperate with the Public Concession Police on this case, but have not fulfilled their promise. Note that both this case and the kidnapping case this morning occurred in the American defense area.

### Puppet Police Interference with Concession Police Authority - The Bureau Will Lodge a Protest - The Protest Letter Is Being Drafted to Be Submitted to the Japanese Authorities

The Continental Times reported yesterday (the 28th) that regarding the "municipal police" interfering with the Public Concession Police Department's activities, the Municipal Council will soon lodge a protest with the Japanese authorities. The protest, which was being drafted yesterday, concerned an incident that occurred on Tuesday night around 9:00 PM. Four Chinese constables were patrolling near Avenue du Parc and Route Doumer when they saw four Chinese men running down Avenue du Parc. They drew their guns and ordered them to stop. They saw one of the men discard something on the roadside. Except for the one person who was arrested, the other three all escaped. However, while the four Chinese constables were escorting the arrested person, they suddenly encountered a large group of puppet police. The puppet police officer said that he knew the arrested person and, relying on their superior numbers, forced the Chinese constables to release him. The four Chinese constables then searched for the item discarded by the arrested person and found that it was an automatic pistol. Firearm experts from the Police Department confirmed that the gun was the same one used to kill Wu Mulan in the Huabei Apartments on Route Massenet last Friday.

### Group Rice Purchasing Fund Increased to Two Million Yuan - The Adjustment Association Announces the Participation of Various Groups - All Agencies and Businesses Have Participated in Ordering

The Shanghai Civil Food Adjustment Association issued an announcement yesterday stating, "Recently, the price of rice in Shanghai has skyrocketed, causing concern about the people's food supply. The hungry are taking risks, and rice robberies are occurring frequently. The livelihoods of salaried workers are greatly threatened, resulting in strikes and labor disputes, leading to social unrest and widespread panic. Currently, the autumn harvest has just ended, and it is a bumper year. The situation is already so serious. In the future, during the lean season, there is a concern that the four million population will run out of food. Even the security of the Concession will be at risk. The future of industry and commerce will also be bleak. Therefore, the authorities of the two Concessions, recognizing the urgency of the situation, have jointly issued a proclamation that those who hoard rice, deliberately raise prices, and harm the survival of the citizens will be severely punished. The major hoarders have slightly restrained themselves, and the price of rice has slightly decreased and is gradually stabilizing. However, ensuring an adequate food supply is a crucial aspect of governance, and the high price of grain is a major social problem. The solution requires both short-term and long-term measures to be effective.

Reasons for High Rice Prices

The reasons for the rising rice prices are primarily due to hoarding by major dealers. However, transportation difficulties, increased shipping costs, environmental restrictions, and scarce sources are also contributing factors. Therefore, the solution to the food problem requires both short-term and long-term approaches. In the short term, pressure must be applied, and the Municipal Council's sanctions must be strictly enforced to prevent unreasonable price increases. At the same time, in the long term, we must seek to expand sources and facilitate flow to ensure a continuous supply of rice and prevent further price increases, or even allow for a price decrease. The former has already been strictly enforced by the Municipal Council, with immediate effects. As for the latter, although Mr. Chu Qiaqing has already initiated the joint purchase of foreign rice with various commercial organizations to increase the food supply, most businesses are adopting a wait-and-see attitude and are unwilling to participate.

Rice Ordering Needs

Now that the price of grain is soaring and people are going hungry, the purchase of foreign rice is even more urgent. Therefore, we have immediately united with various commercial organizations to initiate the organization of the Shanghai Civil Food Adjustment Association, raise funds, and collectively purchase rice. We sincerely hope that each public organization will, according to the needs of their respective companies, firms, factories, and freelancers, gather together and order in large quantities. Let us embrace the spirit of shared destiny and act in a way that benefits both ourselves and others. There is no greater good. Although the current price of foreign rice is slightly higher than the market price, the supply in Shanghai is ultimately limited.

Preparing for the Future

If we do not prepare for it today, then in the future, when resources are exhausted, we will have no way to purchase it even if we double the value. By then, the livelihoods of the citizens, the vitality of industry and commerce, and the stability of society will all be unimaginable. If we can collectively cooperate in this difficult time, use funds to exchange for rice, pay in advance, and store it for future use, then it will not harm the enterprise itself, but will greatly benefit society and the public. The fear of food shortage can be invisibly resolved, and the ease of rice prices falling rather than rising should also be an expected outcome. All public organizations, let us rise up!"

Enthusiastic Contributions

After the Civil Food Adjustment Association established the fundraising method, it invited various industries to continue contributing to the fund for the third time at the Bank Club at 59 Hong Kong Road at 12:00 noon yesterday. After Chairman Yu Qiaqing gave a report, the cigarette industry, woolen industry, bean and rice industry, grain industry, yarn factory industry, etc., continued to contribute 300,000 yuan, bringing the total to 820,000 yuan, including the previous 520,000 yuan. It is learned that the total fund was initially set at one million yuan, but because various industries have enthusiastically contributed, it will be increased to two million yuan.

Rice Ordering Companies

After the Civil Food Adjustment Association began handling registrations for ordering foreign rice on the 27th of this month, the number of people going to the association at 59 Hong Kong Road to collect application forms has been very crowded in recent days. The deadline for officially filling out the application forms was last night, with a total of 149 companies.

Rice Industry Fundraising

The Bean and Rice Grain Industry Fundraising Committee for the Civil Food Adjustment Fund held a joint meeting at its clubhouse at 15 Avenue Edward VII at 3:00 PM yesterday. Chen Ziyi was elected as the temporary chairman. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and then discussions began. Fifteen standing committee members, including Chen Ziyi, were appointed to solicit funds from various industry members. Yesterday, the committee members determined several tens of thousands of yuan on the spot. The Rice Number Industry Association is also actively promoting the fundraising, dividing it into three categories: 25 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. After collecting 20,000 yuan, it will be submitted to the Bean and Rice Association for transfer to the Shanghai Civil Food Adjustment Association for ordering.

The various banks have completed the interest settlement for both the savings and commercial departments and have been rushing to close their accounts for this year. Therefore, collection and delivery have been exceptionally busy. The money shops of the Money Industry Association members have all increased the ordinary closing of accounts once at the end of the Gregorian calendar year. As for December 31st, which is a Sunday holiday, the Executive Committee of the Banking and Money Industry Association has resolved that the various banks' handling of the final accounts is an internal matter and has little to do with the outside world.

### Jinpu Train Encountered a Time Bomb - Foreigners from Jinan to Shanghai Witnessed - Four Train Cars Were Blown Up and Overturned

The North China Daily News reported that several foreigners, who departed from Jinan by train, arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday evening. The monotonous journey was interrupted by the bombing of the train by Chinese troops. Yesterday (the 28th), a passenger who had only been in China for a few months said that the bombing occurred at 9:30 AM on Tuesday, about an hour after the train left Xuzhou. He and two other foreigners were having breakfast in the dining car when suddenly

a loud explosion was heard. The train was violently shaken, causing some of it to derail. The tables and chairs in the dining car were overturned, and the windows were shattered. The train stopped abruptly, but the angle at which the train stopped made it difficult for the people in the car to move. The dining car waiter, who had apparently encountered this type of attack on this line before, shouted,

"Passengers, lie down!" The people in the car lay flat in the car, waiting for developments. However, the guerrillas did not attack. About fifteen minutes later, Japanese soldiers arrived and ordered everyone to get out of the car. As he and other passengers left the damaged dining car, they found that the front part of the train was still on the tracks, while the rear part had four cars, including the baggage car, overturned on the side of the road. The situation at the time

was quite chaotic. Japanese soldiers and train staff were searching for the injured, but only one person was injured, which was quite surprising. That person was a Japanese passenger who was injured in the head, but the injury was not serious. He was treated on the spot. It was then heard that the train was blown up by a time bomb planted under the tracks. When the front part of the train drove over the planted bomb, the pressure caused the bomb to explode when the rear part of the train

was passing over it. Therefore, the locomotive and the first five cars were not derailed and were not damaged. Two hours later, the front part of the train was able to move forward and safely arrived in Pukou. From Nanjing to Shanghai, there were no incidents along the way, and they arrived here on Wednesday evening.

### Japanese-Puppet Control of Vegetables - Inducing Vegetable Merchants to Join - Wholesale Merchants Organize "Guild" - Must Pay a Cash Deposit of 20,000 Yuan

The Continental Times reported that the Japanese and puppet authorities have already monopolized the trade of fresh livestock in Shanghai. Yesterday (the 28th), they were about to complete the plan to seize and estimate the city's vegetable industry. The "Shanghai Vegetable Central Distribution Market" operated by the "Shanghai Municipal Government" is quite ambitious and has far-reaching impact. The market will be located at the Four Banks Warehouse next to the Suzhou Creek. The interior is currently being renovated and will be converted into a large market with stalls for retail and wholesale of vegetables. The renovation work is expected to be completed in

the next month. However, the market personnel have already gradually implemented their plan yesterday, causing a shortage of vegetables in the Public Concession and the French Concession. The main vegetable merchants have already stated that they cannot obtain enough vegetables to meet the city's consumption. It is heard that the market has two non-visible purposes: (1) reduce the amount of vegetables transported into the Concession; (2) induce the city's vegetable merchants to join the market and obtain vegetables from the market after paying a fee. According to well-informed sources, market "inspectors" are already active outside the Huangpu River and the Wusongkou, and are constantly registering vegetables

and ordering ships carrying vegetables to unload vegetables at the temporary markets operated by the puppet government in Yangshupu and Hongkou. Those who refuse are confiscated their entire ship of vegetables, or pay "redemption fees" to the market "inspectors" before they can escape. As for the two Concessions, the market plans to entrust the "Central Enterprise Company" (literal translation) to handle it. The initial work is to recruit city merchants who have been loyal to the Chinese government and refuse to participate in the puppet regime's business, and bring them under its control. According to the market's current regulations, vegetable vendors are divided into three types: wholesalers, brokers, and retailers. It is heard that the wholesalers who have joined the market have formed a "guild" and the members must pay a cash deposit of 20,000 yuan to the market authorities. In addition to setting up a central market at the Four Banks Warehouse, the puppet government has also set up branches in Shiliupu and Caojiadu. Well-informed sources also said that the market is temporarily only monopolizing the vegetable trade, but will soon expand to the trade of fresh fruits and other foods, and monopolize them all.

### Status of Openings and Closings in the Beijiangxi Road Area

Beijiangxi Road, south from the Waterworks Bridge to Laobazi Road, the east side of the street, after the Japanese set up barbed wire fences along the street, they first opened a gap on the side of the Delin Apartments on Chongming Road. After it was blocked, it has not been opened. The Japanese post stationed in front of the Delin Apartments has also been removed. The two gaps at the crossings of Haining Road and Wenjianshi Road are still open, with two Japanese soldiers stationed at each post. Entering and exiting the gaps require showing a "pass" and inspection

is strict. Those carrying items must also be searched. Any hesitation during interrogation will result in detention next to the gap and release after a long time. Therefore, residents entering and exiting are all fearful of it. From west of Beijiangxi Road to east of Beihenan Road, within Area A, where the Japanese have erected borderlines, there are no restrictions, so the shops are still prosperous and pedestrians are still crowded. At the Qianjiang Assembly Hall at the intersection of Beihenan Road and Haining Road, and next to the iron gate bunker at the end of Beihenan Road, there is still one British soldier stationed. South of the iron gate, turning into the boundary road, there are few stores open for business. Only trams on Route 6 and Route 7 continue to terminate at Kenne Road on the boundary road.

### Large Fire Near Great Western Road Yesterday Morning; Xin Xin and Other Factories Completely Burned Down; Three People Fell into the Creek and Drowned

At approximately 2:05 AM yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out at the Xin Xin Nail and Umbrella Rib Factory behind Wangjia Lane on Great Western Road in Shanghai West. The fire was extremely fierce. Upon receiving the report, the Shanghai West Caojiadu Fire Brigade and the Central Fire Brigade immediately rushed to the scene to do their utmost to extinguish the blaze. It took three hours to put out the fire. The residents of the thatched shacks in the area, fearing being buried in the inferno, fled in all directions, resulting in three deaths by drowning in the river. Details of the situation are recorded separately below.

Cause of the Fire The manager of the Xin Xin Nail Factory was Wu Xinshu, a Ningbo native. The factory was relatively large, but the factory buildings were constructed of wooden boards and tar paper, etc. At 2:05 AM yesterday morning, the motor in the factory suddenly short-circuited. Because the factory building materials were extremely flammable, the fire quickly became uncontrollable. It then spread to the Dazhong Machinery Factory, the Yuzhong Foundry, and more than 300 thatched shacks. The residents were startled from their dreams and, supporting the old and carrying the young, fled in droves. The firefighters worked hard to extinguish the blaze, but the fire was extensive and difficult to extinguish. The fire was extinguished at 5:30 AM.

Losses of 80,000 The general shack dwellers who suffered were standing outside the fire scene, wailing and crying, a tragic sight to behold. The losses from this major disaster are estimated as follows: (1) Xin Xin Nail Factory, approximately 58,000 to 59,000 yuan; (2) Dazhong Machinery Factory (factory owner Zhao Jinming from Hebei) lost approximately 10,000 yuan; (3) Zhongyu Foundry (factory owner Gao Hanxing) lost approximately 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. The losses from more than 300 thatched shacks are not yet included in the calculation.

Tragedy Occurred Qin Asong, a Jiangbei native living in the shacks, was fast asleep inside his thatched shack. It was only when the bamboo fence caught fire and dense smoke billowed that he realized what was happening. He hurriedly woke his wife and daughter to escape. Unexpectedly, his seven-year-old daughter, Xiaolingzi, accidentally fell into the stinking creek. Qin's wife, Zhu (32 years old), rushed to rescue her and also fell into the creek. Both tragically drowned. In addition, a young boy from Anhui, Huang Xiaoniu, also fell into the creek and drowned.

### Street Vendor Convicted of Embezzlement and Granted Probation

Chen Shengnian, 33 years old, from Hangzhou, worked as a street vendor for the Hexing Rubber Overshoe Company at 213 Great French Road for eight years. After the Dragon Boat Festival this year, Chen Bingkun, a shareholder and manager of the company, discovered that Chen Shengnian had secretly collected payments of 185 yuan from the Samsung Company and 876.76 yuan from the Dadong Company while employed, and lost it all in gambling dens in Shanghai West. When confronted, Chen Shengnian repeatedly delayed repayment. Chen Bingkun then hired lawyer Jiang Chiping to represent him and filed a private prosecution against Chen Shengnian in the criminal division of the Second Special District Court, accusing him of embezzlement in his duties and requesting legal investigation, along with an accompanying civil lawsuit, ordering the defendant to return the 1,061.76 yuan in private collections. Upon receiving the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Sun Penghian, opened a hearing yesterday afternoon. The plaintiff and his lawyer appeared in court and stated the facts. When questioned, the defendant Chen Shengnian confessed to collecting the payments, explaining that his family had many members and his salary was insufficient to cover expenses. Since the outbreak of the war, he had been even more strapped for cash, leading to successive deficits and that he had not lost it to gambling. He requested leniency as he was currently unable to repay. After reviewing the confession, the court declared the trial closed and immediately sentenced Chen Shengnian to six months in prison, suspended for three years, for continuous embezzlement of items held in his business capacity. He was also ordered to repay the plaintiff 1,061.76 yuan in national currency. During the appeal period, the defendant provided a guarantor to ensure his availability when summoned; otherwise, he would be taken into custody without bail.

### Large Quantity of Opium Intercepted at Taikoo Wharf No. 3; Total of 2,460 Taels Worth Over 100,000 Yuan; Main Culprit Under Strict Investigation

The haze of drugs permeates the outskirts of this port, and is now even worse. The authorities of the concession police are also concerned that drugs will flow into the concession and harm the citizens, so they have long since begun to strictly prohibit drugs. All drug agencies and opium dens hiding in the concession have been repeatedly cracked down on. It is now learned that a large-scale drug trafficking case was cracked in the French Concession the night before. It is reported that the Yihua Company's Taisheng Wheel, which runs between Tianjin and Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai and berthed at Taikoo

Wharf No. 3 of the French Concession at noon the day before. After French Police Inspector Li Xianyang, Chinese Detectives Wang Rusong and Dai Rongji, etc., learned that a large batch of opium had been shipped in, and that people were constantly going to pick it up that evening, they secretly led detectives disguised as peddlers, etc., and lay in ambush there. Around 11 PM that night, they caught sight of people boarding the ship, with shadowy figures moving about. After some time, four people came down from the ship carrying boxes and baskets, planning to transport the items to a certain truck that was waiting there. At this point, the detectives rushed forward and inspected the items. As a result, in a handbag and a rattan basket, they seized a

Large Quantity of Opium. Upon inspection, there was a total of 160 kilograms, equivalent to 2,460 taels, worth more than 100,000 yuan, a truly astonishing amount. The four criminals who were transporting the drugs and the truck were all taken back to the police station. After strict interrogation, it was discovered that two Chinese police officers, Nos. 85 and 239, stationed at the wharf, and another Russian police officer, were all involved in the case. The Chinese police officers were detained yesterday morning, but the Russian police officer had received advance notice and fled. The police station is currently investigating the main culprit.

### Forging Permits and Committing Robbery

You Jieqi from Changzhou, Ying Zhaogen from Shaoxing, and Liu Chunbao from Shandong, forged Hongkou resident permits issued by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce between July and December 10 of this year, deceiving various households in the area. Many residents were harmed by these individuals. The case was uncovered, and the Chinese and Western detectives of the Hongkou Police Station arrested and escorted them to the First Special District Court. The investigation revealed that the two defendants You and Liu had stolen valuables worth more than one hundred yuan from No. 155 Broadway Road, No. 69 Haining Road, and No. 291 Wuchang Road between November 10 and December 10. A total of 60 Municipal Chamber of Commerce permits, 42 photos, and 5 epidemic prevention certificates were seized in this case. After receiving instructions and completing the interrogation, they were awaiting sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the court and sentenced You Jieqi to two years and four months of imprisonment, Ying Zhaogen to two years, and Liu Chunbao (who was not involved in the permit forgery) to eight months for the theft, as a warning.

According to a French-language Shanghai Daily News report on the 29th, it was reported that a French citizen named Ouhua (transliteration) was recently arrested by the French Concession Police for allegedly obtaining property through fraud and forging Japanese permits. Previously, the Japanese authorities discovered that several Chinese people were carrying forged permits to infiltrate various locations in Hongkou. Through the confessions of the previously arrested criminals, it was determined that Ouhua was the main culprit. It is now reported that Ouhua has been handed over to the French Consul to be investigated by the police department.

### Woman Commits Suicide Due to Economic Oppression

Cao Chen, a 31-year-old woman from Pudong, lived at No. 52 Yiye Lane, Fuli Road, in the French Concession. Her husband had been unemployed for a long time and was under economic pressure. Some time ago, Cao Chen borrowed several yuan from a neighboring woman. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Cao Chen asked her husband for money to repay the neighbor. Because her husband had no money to give her, Cao Chen had a quarrel with her husband. Afterwards, the woman secretly swallowed poison and committed suicide. After being discovered, she was rushed to the hospital, but she had ingested a large amount of poison and her life was in critical condition.

### Shanghai Circles Commemorate Ma Boxian; Shan Yuanlvdeng and Lin Kanghou Preside Over the Ceremony

Philanthropist Ma Boxian, given name Suiliang, posthumous title Wenhui, was the respected father of renowned lawyer Dr. Ma Junshuo. He dedicated his life to disaster relief, education, and helping others. He was renowned nationwide for his calligraphy and epigraphy. In the past, he assisted Zhang Jian in Nantong in preparing for self-government and also assisted General Zhu Ziqiao in handling disaster relief, displaying outstanding competence and diligence. In his later years, he retired to Shanghai and participated in charitable undertakings, donating the proceeds from his seal carving of "Gong Bang" to charitable causes. His upright character and warm heart were highly respected by society. After Ma's death, various circles in this port prepared a memorial service, scheduled for tomorrow (the 31st) at Huguo Temple. In the morning, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Lvdeng, Chen Tingrui, and others will preside over the ceremony. In the afternoon, various public organizations and the Nantong Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai will preside over the ceremony. Chairman Lin of the National Government and Dean Ju, among others, have sent condolence messages. All funeral donations will be used for charitable purposes. It is expected that at that time, the white horses and plain carriages will be extremely solemn and honorable.

### Corpses Found All Over the Streets

Due to the stable weather conditions in various parts of China, the weather in this port is not extremely cold. However, the frost is very heavy in the mornings and evenings, causing beggars who sleep outdoors to succumb to the cold and freeze to death. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired at Pushan Villa yesterday, as of 5:00 PM yesterday, the hall had collected seven frozen male corpses and one female corpse. The locations were Wuhu Road, Henan Road, North Shansi Road, North Suzhou Road, North Fujian Road, etc. In addition, the hall collected as many as sixty-seven children's corpses yesterday, ranging in age from several months to two or three years old. Most of the locations were Robert Road in the Western District, Great Western Road, and Little Sandu Road. There were fewer in the Central District.

### Confiscation of Meili Brand Matches

Sixty-one private cargo manifests, including those of Shanghai Weitong Heji Textile Company, have been ordered to be confiscated and publicly announced to be registered between December 1 and December 10. It is now found that a type of Meili brand match on the market, produced by the Shanghai Dachunghua Match Company, is uniformly regarded as private cargo and confiscated. It is stipulated that this Meili brand match must be registered before the end of December, and if the deadline is exceeded, it will be confiscated.

### Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor, Our client, Mr. Zhang Wuliang, claims that the article titled "A Newly Married Couple Suddenly Have a Dispute at the Home of a Friend at Night" in the Local News section of the Chinese News on December 29 is completely one-sided and does not correspond to the facts. According to the plaintiff Yang Hu's husband, Yang Yongnian, who married on November 5 of this year, borrowed two rings and cash at the time, and still owes 90 yuan. He has repeatedly been contacted but has repeatedly delayed repayment. On the evening of the 15th of this month, he went to Yang Yongnian's house on Xin Zha Road to demand repayment of the loan. Yang Yongnian falsely claimed that the rings, etc., were with his wife, the plaintiff, who was ill at her mother's house. When they unexpectedly went together, he still did not return the gold rings. When they argued about it, he was beaten and injured by Yang Yongnian and Lou and others. Because friends and relatives persuaded him, it was difficult to report the matter to the police on the 18th of this month, but he did not pursue it. Yang Yongnian plans to evade the debt, attempting to extort money, fabricating facts, and instigating his wife to sue for injury and a miscarriage. After the court summoned them, the trial opened on the 28th. The judge instructed the plaintiff in court that after a forensic examination, there were no scars. The report was attached to the file, which can be said to be conclusive evidence against the plaintiff. He was asked if he had any previous illnesses. He replied that he had headaches and stomachaches. From the time of the marriage to the accident, it was only 40 days. According to his testimony in court, she had been pregnant for a month and a half. In short, the facts are not entirely true. He is delusional, trying to use criminal charges as a threat to extort money. Therefore, he specially commissioned your lawyer to send a letter of correction to avoid confusion and misinterpretations. Please publish this letter to uphold public justice. Sincerely, Lawyer Tao Ran, December 29.

Dear Editor, The article titled "Bankruptcy Case of Jiande Bank" published in the News section of your newspaper on page 8 on December 26 stated that "the Shanghai Jiande Commercial Savings Bank closed and went bankrupt on December 7, 1934. On July 24, 1935, the First Special District Court ruled that it was bankrupt and appointed accountant Li Ding as the bankruptcy administrator." It also stated that "Gu Kenfu and other masters claimed that the bankrupt person and the bankruptcy administrator colluded with each other, representing false debts, hindering the rights of the bankruptcy estate and the bankruptcy creditors, and privately accepting loans, tampering with account books, and forging signatures. Xie Keming sued Xie Keming, Yu Yuanxiang, Yan Fanfang, Qin Wenqun, etc., in the First Special Court." This is easy to misunderstand. The Jiande Bank was adjudicated bankrupt on July 24, 1935. At that time, the Twentieth Court appointed lawyer Shen Junru and our accountant as bankruptcy administrators. On April 27, 1937, the third creditors' meeting was convened. The creditors requested the re-election of the bankruptcy administrator in accordance with the bankruptcy law. The voting result was that Yu Yuanxiang was elected as the bankruptcy administrator. On June 18 of the same year, the court issued a ruling removing lawyer Shen Junru from his position as administrator, and Yu Yuanxiang took over. Our accountant continued to handle the duties. This is the history of the administrator of this case. As for the various matters mentioned in your newspaper, our accountant is completely unaware. Please correct the report in your newspaper to set the record straight. We would be most grateful. Sincerely, Jiande Bank Bankruptcy Administrator, Accountant Li Ding, December 28, 1939.

### What is Objectivity?

— Wenge

According to some scholars, objectivity is a method of observing things from a general standpoint, as opposed to subjectivity, which refers to individual thoughts or feelings. While general opinions are often more appropriate than individual views, they are only appropriate; they do not necessarily grasp the correctness of things. For example, before the Xinhai Revolution, was the internal and external situation not very critical? Therefore, those who had awakened all knew that they should use fresh blood to save it once. However, at that time, the general public was stimulated by stories like "Long Hair" (referring to Taiping rebels). Although they knew that the future was not optimistic, they still held the view of "preferring to be a dog in times of peace than a person in times of chaos," attempting to maintain a temporary peace. If someone at this time actually followed suit because it was the opinion of the majority, can you completely agree with this statement?

So, what exactly is objectivity? I believe that it refers to the real and truthful reflection. Reality exists independently outside of our consciousness, and it will not change due to individual prejudices. However, although this objectivity is very correct, we must be able to cleverly integrate it in order to benefit humanity. Otherwise, objectivity is objectivity, and humans are humans, and there is no connection between the two.

Many people say: a realistic writer must also be objective at the same time. Thinking about this roughly, it seems quite reasonable; but in reality, it is not so simple. Literature needs an objective reflection of reality, which is a necessary thing. However, I believe that what this reflection can achieve is only to copy reality like a photograph. As for further steps, destroying the things that hinder the progress of mankind, and indicating the correct path for mankind, it has no ability to take care of. Why? Because objectivity "itself" has no meaning. What becomes meaningful is the result of human subjective feeling giving objective suggestion.

The reason why human beings objectively recognize reality is to obtain the universality of truth; and the focus is on enabling us to practice correctly. This practice is the action taken by human beings based on the objective reflection and with subjective action.

A Soviet theorist said: "Towards nature, it is not a passive expectation attitude, but an active creative attitude; towards labor, it is not always done as a kind of misfortune, but always done as a force to transform the world." Since we should have an active creative attitude, it is evident that subjectivity is possible. What is different from idealism is that the so-called subjectivity is not just random thinking based on one's own mental function, but is completely based on objective facts.

Today, if a writer does not want to wear the name of an individualist or an escapist, etc., he must be advocating art for the sake of life, and at the same time must be a realist. This realism is naturally based on a method that unifies the subjective grasp and the objective reflection as the basic principle.

However, the facts tell us: some people who loudly advocate reality often abuse objectivity to castrate the meaning of art for the sake of life. They say: We are free intellectuals, so we should completely stand in an objective position, and we cannot have any tendencies. In fact, if inclination is really not necessary, then advocating objectivity, advocating anything, is it not precisely the tendency that should be rejected? This is very similar to the story of the sow crossing the river!

In short, it is right that literature needs objectivity, but it should be noted that this is only a kind of contribution that literature makes to life, not the entire contribution. Standing by with folded arms and transcending objectivity over the heads of human beings should be corrected.

### Liang Dong and His Poems

— Zou Xiao

Liang Dong, courtesy name Longji, was a poet of the late Song Dynasty. His ancestors were from Xiangzhou, later moved to Ezhou, and finally moved to Zhenjiang. After the fall of the Song Dynasty, he went to live idly in Wulin. He had a younger brother, Liang Zhu, who studied Taoism at Maoshan, so he lived with him. He wrote a poem "Damao Peak" on the wall, but someone actually reported it to Jurong County, saying that he was defaming the imperial court. The provincial government then relayed it to the capital, and Liang Dong was arrested and imprisoned. Finally, the Ministry of Rites pardoned him, and he was released. His poem "Damao Peak" only had these six poignant lines: "No one guards the Yuan Emperor's cauldron anymore, a visitor wants to ask about the Qin Emperor's gold...I come, looking up and down, full of sorrow, the mountains and rivers are still what they were, but the people are different! How to get a tall pine to support the sun and the moon, so the Huayang world can shield the layers of shade?"

From then on, his reputation as a poet greatly increased, and many people learned poetry from him. His poems had no drafts. His disciples asked him, "Why don't you keep drafts of your poems, sir?" He said: "If my poems can be passed down to future generations, people will naturally have mental drafts of them." But his disciples and descendants were unwilling to let his poems be completely lost, so they collected them. What we see now in Volume 12 of the Records of Song Loyalists is only twenty-five poems and two lyrics. The Song Poetry Excerpts records even fewer, without the three poems supplemented by Zhibuzu Zhai, the one poem attached to the notes, the one poem on hearing the sound of a horn on the Zhenhai Tower, and the two lyrics, so there are only twenty in total. His birth date was the sixteenth day of the twelfth month of the Chunyou year of Emperor Lizong of the Song Dynasty (Renyin, 1242), and his death date was the seventh day of the seventh month of the Dade year of Emperor Chengzong of the Yuan Dynasty (Yisi, 1305), at the age of sixty-four.

Among these twenty-four poems, they can be divided into the following five groups according to their nature:

The first group: using ancient sites to write about the hatred of national subjugation "The rise and fall of dynasties pass before my eyes" (Rain Flower Terrace) "City and countryside, right and wrong, outside of autumn rain" (Phoenix Terrace) "Green mountains sit and watch the rise and fall of dynasties" (Ruined Palace of Jinling) "White herons do not know so much, how many years have passed since Chiwu. The past events of the Six Dynasties are the Qinhuai River, a flute of evening wind and a boat on the Jiapu River." (White Heron Pavilion) "Hearing the sad singing, I lean alone on the tower, the blue sky is boundless and my thoughts are long. Who knew that it was the hatred of the Central Plains, blowing to the first state in the southeast." (Climbing the Zhenhai Tower) "The setting sun and rivers and mountains are suitable for drinking wine, the west wind and the dog country are making people sad." (Feeling Jinling's Three Moves)

The second group: using historical figures to write about the hatred of national subjugation "The return to the field magistrate only wrote about Jin, the halberd-bearing gentleman is all beautifully new." (Giving to Fellow Villager Xu from Jiaxing) "It is good to return to the field if you have land, it is also good to return even if you have no land...The East Sea cannot be fished, and the West Mountain cannot be picked. Crying loudly has already become a habit, where will I return to now." (Sending Li Beishan back to Jiankang) "At that time, millions of soldiers were pressing the border, not taking off their boot tips, they could be kicked down. Short weapons are connected for more than four sentences, vicious hands and respected fists attack every day. Internal storage and external aid both subsided, a strand of people's hearts firmly protected itself. A lonely minister guarding the land valued his life lightly, red children died effectively, smearing their livers and brains. The imperial court had a title, ashamed to surrender, the secluded earth had no kindness to nourish the withered." (Mourning Piling: Yuan soldiers attacked Changzhou, Yao Qian and Wang Anjie died)

The third group: using wind and rain to write about the hatred of national subjugation "The owner only has the heart to cross the river, sitting and watching the water in front of the door deepen day by day." (Wild Water Lonely Boat) "Tigers and wolves are running rampant, white bones are in the wilderness, I am heartbroken and heartbroken again, why should I worry about my hunger!" (Feeling after a long rain)

The fourth group: using animals to write about the hatred of national subjugation "Crying and breaking the Central Plains, there is no place to live, it is better to go home!" "What can I do with this vast world, I can't go, older brother!" "Everyone is drunk, and I am also drunk, alas, who can wake up Qu Yuan? Lift the gourd!" (The Third of the Four Birds Speaking) "A few households in the alleys have no master swallows." (Spring Day Outing and Friends Rhyming)

The fifth group: using plants to write about the hatred of national subjugation "The family suddenly becomes rich, with thirty-six kinds of vegetable seeds. The foolish child does not understand things, asking me where I got them. If I violate righteousness, I would rather starve than eat." (Planting Vegetables) "Loyalty and filial piety come from the true nature." (Yellow Sunflower)

Hu Yunai called Liang Dong "of clear and upright character, not ashamed of the ancients." This is truly correct!

### Warning

— Mo Ai

Thin dark clouds swept over the mountain peaks, casting several fleeting shadows under the sunlight.

"Dong…Dong…Dong…" The bell sound echoed from the secluded valley, breaking the quiet solitude, making people stir like ripples in a small wave.

Shopkeepers, while chanting, "Arise! Arise! You who do not wish to be slaves of a conquered nation…" hurriedly and noisily put up the shop's wooden planks, one by one.

Men carried boxes and net baskets, while women carried children and bundles on their backs. They passed by as naturally as flowing water.

"Is it an air raid alarm? But why are the locals so calm?" I suspiciously looked at the policeman standing at the crossroads.

"What's up, comrade!" The policeman noticed my suspicion and ran over.

"What's going on?" I still looked at the policeman with surprise.

He smiled, as if joking with me, "Air raid alarm, turn left, to the mountain pass!" He waved his hand, gesturing, and then went to direct another group of people.

Having just left the isolated island, I realized it was indeed an "air raid," and my nerves immediately tensed up. I quickly turned left, following another group of people "avoiding the raid."

A sixty-year-old father-in-law, a seventy-year-old mother-in-law, and a group of young women were sitting in twos and threes under the shade of trees in the rocky gullies, with their belongings beside them. The younger lads had all climbed to the top of the mountain to "look out."

Next to me was a leather craftsman. He was sitting on a wooden box, holding a piece of old, shiny hemp cloth, calmly laying it on his knee. Then he took out his hammer, hemp rope, and unfinished shoes, burying his head in his work, his hands moving back and forth like a weaver's shuttle.

"Hey! Fellow villager, it's an air raid alarm! What are you doing here? Is there an air raid shelter here?" Doubt and fear coursed through my entire nervous system, and the leather craftsman's silence was making me impatient.

"The emergency alarm hasn't come yet. There won't be any 'fire' here." He glanced at me with his terribly round eyes and then buried himself in his work again. "No, I'm not talking about fire. I'm asking where is the air raid shelter to hide from the planes?" I asked anxiously, my voice heavy with worry.

"Isn't this the place to hide from planes?" He pointed to the towering peaks all around, and to the crowds scattered in the gullies, and continued, "Even a thousand or ten thousand planes couldn't bomb this place!" He was as happy as if he had defeated someone.

Only then did I realize the advantage of this geographical environment. I looked around again, and felt even more that the peaks were piled up on each other, and that, apart from the children playing hide-and-seek, none of the adults were not like the leather craftsman, doing their own work, everything seeming peaceful and ordinary.

I unfolded my handkerchief and placed it on a stone, and sat next to the wooden box the leather craftsman was sitting on. Then we started chatting:

"Do planes come here often?"

"Yes, they come two out of three days!" He moved his seat a little, ran the awl through his hair a couple of times, and then hurriedly drilled into the edge of the shoe sole.

"Has this place been bombed?"

"Not here, but I heard that Zhijiang and Yuanling were bombed badly, damn it!" He stopped his work, supported his neck with both hands, as if thinking about something.

"Why did you bring so many shoes out?" I pointed to the two pairs in front of him.

"These are the only things we have! … And! … Actually, those two thatched bamboo houses are too dilapidated anyway. It wouldn't be a big deal if they were bombed!" His dark eyes widened even more, and his attitude was even more stubborn than before.

"You guys work hard! Moving things in and out."

"We're used to moving, it's nothing. All our belongings are just this much anyway." He played with the hemp rope with his fingers, like a mother caressing her child.

"Whoo… Whoo… Whoo…"

"The alarm is over!" He greeted me, and put the shoes and tools into the wooden box, put on the net basket, and slowly carried them back.

Men, women, old and young, with boxes, baskets, and bundles, formed a sparse line again.

Bustling, like a group of primary school students dismissed from school!

The thin dark clouds were gone, and cunning old eagles soared high in the clear sky.

The surrounding peaks were silent, mocking the eagles' stupidity.

Performing Arts World

### A Year of Northern Actors Coming to Shanghai 'Dan'… The Younger Generation Surpasses the Old 'Sheng'… Newcomers Don't Necessarily Surpass the Old

— Mei Jun

Two Old Floral Shirts, Two All-Knowing Masters

I have often heard from veteran performers, "The 'sheng' role is easy to master but difficult to perfect, while the 'dan' role is easy to learn but difficult to master." Observing the actors invited by Shanghai theaters in the past year, I feel that this saying is true and well-founded. It is not just based on one's experience and saying something against one's heart.

In the Beijing opera world, talents in both 'sheng' and 'dan' roles have emerged in recent decades, but there have been fewer outstanding new talents in the 'sheng' roles recently. After the "Four Great Dan Actresses" (Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Xun Huisheng, Shang Xiaoyun), there were the so-called "Four Little Dan Actresses," who were also quite dazzling for a time. Although their skills have not yet reached a solid level, such as Li Shifang's vocal problems, Zhang Junqiu's unclear pronunciation, Song Dezhu's limitations in martial arts roles, and Mao Shilai's immaturity, these are minor flaws that can be improved with effort and training. Furthermore, Zhao Jinrong, Hou Yulan, Li Yuru, and Bai Yuwei from the opera schools may also be able to establish their own styles outside of the "Four Little Dan Actresses." The 'dan' actors invited to Shanghai's Golden Theater in the past year also belong to this group of newcomers, such as Mao Shilai, Hou Yulan, and Song Dezhu. All of them returned north with reputations. After the autumn coolness, the Updated Theater also used 'dan' actors as a selling point, inviting 'dan' actors such as Zhao Jinrong, Wu Suqiu, Liang Yunqiu, and Zheng Bingru. Their performances at the dedicated theater were sometimes better, sometimes worse, but no less than those at the Golden Theater. Except for Zhang Eyun, who had been famous for a decade, none of them had just started to show their talents. Huang Guiqiu, an old actor who claimed to have been personally taught by De Lin, was certainly not weak in skill, but ultimately did not achieve success. Isn't this a sign that the younger generation of 'dan' actors is surpassing the old?

As for 'sheng' roles, the opposite is true. In the past year, the actors who performed in Shanghai include Zhou Xiaotian, Sha Shixin, Yang Shisen, Yan Jupeng, and An Shuyuan at the Golden Theater, Chen Shaolin and Guan Dayuan at the Updated Theater, and Guan Shaohua and Gao Jingmin at the Tianchan and Card theaters. Among them, Yan, Guan, and An are veteran actors, while Zhou, Sha, Yang, Chen, Guan, and Gao are mostly newcomers. The performances of the newcomers are not as good as those of the veteran actors. Except for Yang Shisen, whose popularity is better and whose seats are not declining, the others all returned north disappointed. Since the deaths of Yu Shuyan and Zhou Xinfang, and the illness of Tan Fuying, the pillars of the Beijing opera world are Tan, Ma, Meng, Yan, Shi, and Guan, who are either in their prime and full of energy, or adhere to the styles of their predecessors and correct contemporary habits. They are not comparable to ordinary newcomers. Therefore, newcomers in 'sheng' roles don't necessarily surpass the old. Considering the saying, "Listen to 'sheng' in your youth, watch 'dan' in your later years," isn't this what it means?

In the past year, the Golden Theater had a special feature at the beginning and end of the year. This spring (at the end of the lunar year), Feng Zihe, as a rare old performer, showed his talent again. Although it was only for a short time, it left a deep impression on the audience. Also, the old court musician Wang Yaoqing and his student Wang Yurong came together, personally overseeing the performances. Their appeal was also not weak. Yaoqing has accepted many students and is known as the "All-Knowing Master." Li Hongchun, who performed at the Updated Theater this time, has a very broad belly and can perform many plays. People in the industry also call him the "All-Knowing Master." Two old floral shirts, two all-knowing masters, embellish the Shanghai opera scene in the past year. Isn't it also something precious? This is added here.

Reflections on Dance Groups

### Magazine (4)

— Xiao Tian

(57) The Biography of Yu Dingguo in the Book of Han states: "In the East Sea, there was a filial woman named Xiao Gui, who became a widow at a young age and had no children. She took care of her mother-in-law very diligently. Her mother-in-law wanted her to remarry, but she refused. Her mother-in-law said to her neighbors, 'Xiao Gui serves me diligently. I pity her for becoming a widow and having no children. I am old and will burden her for a long time. What should I do?' Later, the mother-in-law hanged herself. The mother-in-law's daughter told the officials that the daughter-in-law had killed her mother. The officials arrested Xiao Gui. Xiao Gui denied killing her mother-in-law. The officials investigated, and Xiao Gui falsely confessed. The case was reported to the prefectural government. Yu Gong believed that this woman had taken care of her mother-in-law for more than ten years and was known for her filial piety, so she would not kill her. The prefect refused to listen. Yu Gong argued with him, but to no avail. He then held the case file, cried in the prefectural office, and resigned due to illness. The prefect eventually ordered the filial woman to be executed. The county suffered a three-year drought. When the next prefect arrived, he consulted diviners about the cause. Yu Gong said, 'The filial woman should not have died. The previous prefect forcibly ordered her execution. Could the blame lie there?' He then sacrificed an ox to the filial woman's tomb and erected a monument. It rained heavily, and the year was fruitful. The county greatly respected Yu Gong because of this." Therefore, stubbornly adhering to preconceived notions without considering human emotions and examining the truth often leads to a hundred mistakes. Therefore, in everything, one should first put oneself in the other person's shoes, and then observe their sincerity, watch their expression, and consider what one can do without violating righteousness, so as to minimize mistakes. Now, dance patrons may not distinguish between truth and falsehood, not consider their own abilities, and indulge in infatuation, or they may stubbornly adhere to the preconceived notion that prostitutes have no feelings and exploit them to the fullest. Dance hostesses may cling to foolish fantasies and not consider the other person's situation, or they may stubbornly adhere to the preconceived notion that playboys have no loyalty and exploit them to the fullest. Neither is good. Also, disputes often arise between couples because one of them likes to dance, leading to undesirable consequences. Some are abandoned for infidelity, while others are suspected due to excessive suspicion. Supposing something is theft when it is not, or robbery when it is not, is not as good as actually stealing or robbing, and getting real benefits. This is the feeling of ordinary people. Furthermore, people who work must be compensated. If a wife performs household labor for her husband, and manages expenses efficiently, the husband should compensate her. If a husband performs economic labor for his wife, and provides ample food and clothing, and brings honor to relatives and neighbors, the wife should also compensate him. If one side does not compensate, the other side will compensate themselves, which is inevitable. Now, seeing couples quarrel, they quibble over whether the other party has fulfilled one, two, ten, or a hundred percent of their labor for them, without considering how much labor they themselves have provided for the other party, and whether they can be fair. One is not the great Shun, yet expects the other to be his consorts, Ehuang and Nuying; one is not Dong Xiaowan, yet expects the other to be Mao Pijiang. Is this not absurd? Passing by Da Dong, I saw several patrons sitting at a table with a dance hostess. Shortly after, one patron's shrewish wife arrived, rushed forward, and slapped the hostess's cheek. The hostess cried and cursed, and the wife then slapped the patron's cheek and yanked his tie. The patron also cursed angrily and fought back, and the entire room erupted in an uproar. They were then dragged out of the dance hall by several patrons, and it is feared that there will be another quarrel. A month ago, a friend was at the YMCA renewing glue, and was surprised that his ex-wife, who was still in her prime, had died prematurely. Another friend told him the reason, which was quite similar to this. One must be careful.

### Anecdotes from the Pear Garden

Is Gui Junqing still alive?

His portrayal of Lu Su in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" was able to depict the demeanor of a sincerely kind gentleman with remarkable skill. Others merely focus on depicting Lu Dafu's dullness, turning him into a foolish and awkward Lu Zijing, which is disrespectful to the ancients. Gui also had skills with his head and feet. From these two points, it can be seen that his studies were indeed more in-depth than others. Insiders said that "twirling the gauze hat wings" was something that only he and Pan Yueqiao could do well in Shanghai at the time. If he wore a blue official robe (although some wore purple official robes, according to the rules of old operas, purple was more expensive than blue, so it was more appropriate for those playing Lu Su to wear purple official robes) and walked on stage, the gauze hat wings on both sides would flutter tremulously, which was very beautiful. Young male roles focused on pheasant feathers, while martial male roles focused on banner work (old male roles with beards were also the same. No matter how intense the fighting was, as soon as they stopped, the four banners on their back would still hang down separately, without getting tangled together, which was called real skill. Anyone who has seen Xiao Lou perform in "Changban Slope" praises this skill.) When the gauze hat wings of old male roles swing up and down, they are like the two wings of a butterfly. Those who are not experts in watching operas would not pay attention to these details. Even among the performers themselves, if they do not have roots in their feet and skill in their heads, even if they shake their heads all the time, they will not be able to swing the wings beautifully. At the same time, Junqing also had a very beautiful feature, which was that when he sat on the edge of the stage, his legs were straight, and a pair of distinct black and white boot tips would show under his neatly arranged official robe. Just sitting casually on a chair would be more balanced and dignified than others who spent a long time adjusting their official robes by hand. (169)
