Chongqing. According to sources within military circles here, since the Japanese army's retreat from the northern Hunan front, all lines have been relatively quiet. There have been no major battles in North China, Central China, or South China in the past two months. In reality, the Chinese and Japanese armies are currently facing each other across the same defensive lines that they have held since the fall of Nanchang six months ago. The activities of the Japanese air force in various parts of China have also significantly decreased. Chongqing, which previously suffered continuous air raids, now feels relatively peaceful. According to well-informed observers, this situation is merely the calm before the storm, as it is generally believed that the Sino-Japanese War is gradually approaching a decisive phase, and the two armies will inevitably engage in a decisive battle next year.

### Nanchuan Suffers Tragic Japanese Air Raid; Common People Unaware of Evacuation, Resulting in Heavy Casualties; French Church Reduced to Ashes, Priest Injured

Chongqing. According to news received here today, Japanese aircraft carried out a massive bombing raid on Nanchuan, located fifty miles southeast of Chongqing, on the 13th of this month. Nanchuan has a population of only 20,000. As a result of this Japanese air raid, 200 Chinese civilians were killed and 500 were wounded. At the same time, French Catholic priest Daniel was also injured, suffering shrapnel wounds to his head and legs. He only arrived in Chongqing today and is being treated at a French Catholic hospital. It is said that the Nanchuan Catholic Church, valued at 500,000 yuan, has been reduced to ashes by this Japanese air raid. Father Daniel stated that the population of Nanchuan is not large and has no defenses against air raids. Most of the people are farmers or refugees from other areas. They were initially unaware that this place would also be subjected to air raids. Therefore, when the Japanese aircraft arrived, the people behaved as usual, making no effort to evacuate, resulting in heavy casualties.

Editorial

### International Assessments

Why did China and Japan go to war? Why did England and Germany go to war? The world forum has an answer, similar in both cases: miscalculation. Japan underestimated China's strength, and believed that the Communist Party did not know their homeland and was irreconcilably opposed to the Kuomintang; that military men and politicians only fought for power, interest, and opportunity, and that traitors could be found everywhere. Therefore, the National Government was unwilling and unable to fight. Even if it did fight, the army would be defeated in one battle, and the government would collapse in the next. Who knew that Shanghai's triangular plain, defended by Japan's combined forces, would hold out for three months? That the Communist Party would embrace the Three Principles of the People, that military and political affairs would rapidly unify, that national unity would create an unprecedented situation in history, and that the war would continue for three years to this day? Germany underestimated England's will, disregarded good faith, and believed it had no determination to fight. When the Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact was suddenly concluded, Germany thought it had diplomatically reversed the situation and acquired the tool to restrain Germany. England was even more exhausted and discouraged. If Germany attacked Poland, even if England made a military protest on the Western Front, as long as the German army quickly and decisively resolved Poland, England would surely lower its flag, silence its drums, and talk about appeasement. Who knew that England would grit its teeth as it does today?

Those who miscalculate will suffer the consequences. Moreover, we not only do not want to use this as a means to mock Japan and Germany, but also deeply understand the difficulty of assessment. China has been in internal strife for a long time, and the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have been at odds for a long time. The four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe fell without a fight, and the Songhu and Tanggu agreements were signed one after another. All of these were taken by Japan as data to assess China. Even after the outbreak of the war of resistance, there were still people like Han Fuju, who conformed to Japan's standards and became traitors. It can be seen that although there is a lot of data, assessment is very difficult. As for England and Germany, do not say that Hitler's reason was obscured by greed. Even after England declared war on Germany, before Prime Minister Chamberlain's reply to Hitler's speech, many people in the world doubted whether England would stick to its intentions. Observers were like this, so how is it different from Hitler's miscalculation? What cannot be done for Japan and Germany is: when Japan assessed China, it never thought that the Chinese government and people were no longer comparable to the late Song and Ming dynasties. At the critical juncture of life and death, would they not exhaust all their national strength to resist and defend themselves? Japan also forgot that it was a different race from China, and expected the Chinese to be insane and regard foreign aggression as internal strife. When Germany assessed England, it never thought about the complexity of England's international relations. If England could endure Germany's humiliation on the day the Anglo-Polish Mutual Assistance Treaty was signed, it would clearly be shameless, humble, and content with living in humiliation. Could the British Empire still be maintained? Therefore, although the focus of the dispute is in Poland, it is also a matter of life and death for England. Japan and Germany did not think deeply and carefully to assess China and England, but only did not assess that the other party's life and death issues must be different from any other issues. In the end, the development of the facts far exceeded the assessment, and they fell into a situation where they could not stop, which is appropriate.

From the extreme difficulty of assessment, and the lessons of Japan and Germany, inferring the current evolution of general international affairs, there are some recent news that are still difficult to discern and should be closely watched: the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Turkey and Finland have all been frustrated. Although the actual content has not been made public, the dynamics between the Soviet Union and Turkey and Finland will hardly return to stillness due to the frustration. If it is not still, it will force Turkey and Finland, as well as those who have common relations with the two countries, to do something. This is one thing. Italy advocated anti-communism in the past, and then watched the changes with a heavy heart. Since the expansion of the Soviet Union and Germany gradually succeeded, it has recently been rumored that Italy is quite uneasy. Because of the pressure of the environment, Italy feels that its safety, danger, honor, and disgrace are in question, and it is difficult to maintain this situation for a long time. This is another thing. Under the emotion of utter desperation, England determined its determination to continue fighting against Germany, but for other aspects, it has moved from reaction to the state of not daring to be firm and resolute. Those who have discerned England's weakness have spread the news that the Soviet army is marching south from Central Asia, plotting to intercept England. Therefore, the Anglo-Japanese declaration of alliance and the Anglo-Japanese restoration of the alliance have been repeatedly publicized. If this is credible, it will make the international situation even more changed. This is another thing. All these things, the politicians of the countries concerned, are using their hearing, intelligence, and talent to brew the future situation.

No one can predict what the result of the brewing will be, but we cannot help but say: the international history of Austria and Czechoslovakia sitting and waiting to die has passed, and no country will ever follow the footsteps of Austria and Czechoslovakia. China's resistance to Japan, England's declaration of war on Germany, and even Germany's willingness to make friends with opposing ideologies and abandon part of its ambition to advance east and north, are actually due to the fact that each has no choice, and a situation that cannot be assessed has been formed. If the current evolution of the international situation further forces some countries to a point of no return, we will see more unexpected phenomena in the international situation. Indeed, after the successive deaths of Austria and Czechoslovakia, any nation, whenever it encounters a critical juncture of life and death, must know how to transcend politics and ideology in order to survive. In other words, if a nation is forced to be on the line of death, the differences between all political ideologies will no longer be the norm for assessing international affiliations and distances!

### Nordic Conference Concludes; Heads of Four Countries Deliver Speeches; Reiterate Common Wish to Maintain Neutrality; Roosevelt Cables the Conference Expressing Support

Stockholm, Sweden. The foreign ministers of the four Nordic countries continued their conference this morning at 10:00 AM, and went to the Swedish Royal Palace at noon to hold a plenary meeting with the heads of their respective countries. Immediately afterwards, they announced the closing and the heads of the countries delivered broadcast speeches. King Gustaf V of Sweden said, "The peoples of the four Nordic countries wish to live in peace with other peoples, but want to do so as free people. As such, the right of the four Nordic countries to live in peace and their freedom should not be harmed by others." King Christian X of Denmark followed by declaring, "The heads of state of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and myself held a meeting in Malmö, Sweden, in 1914, declaring a sense of solidarity. To this day, this spirit remains as before, and we share a common wish to maintain neutrality." President Kallio of Finland followed by declaring, "It is necessary for the four Nordic countries to act with a common attitude and common action. Their mutual cooperation has already been seen in words and should also be seen in action. The peoples of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden have a deep emotional connection with our country. I am grateful for the welcome and sympathy shown to me by the Swedish people. Our country is preparing to defend its independence and traditional rights. Our people want to live in peace within their territory and hope that strong neighbors will respect the commitments they have accepted and resolve outstanding issues peacefully. Our country will fulfill its commitments and promises." Then, King Haakon VII of Norway spoke, saying, "The four Nordic countries have always promoted democracy and have faith in the future." The rights they possess and their determination to maintain neutrality cannot be swayed by anyone. (19th Havas dispatch)

Stockholm, Sweden. The leaders of the Nordic countries began a two-day meeting here yesterday. It is believed that the main themes of their deliberations are: the possibility of peace, the Soviet Union's advance in the Baltic Sea, and the talks between the Soviet Union and Finland. Attendees included King Gustaf of Sweden, King Christian of Denmark, King Haakon of Norway, President Kallio of Finland, and their respective foreign affairs officials. It is expected that the leaders of the four countries will issue a communiqué when they broadcast from the palace today. The leaders of the four countries held a meeting in the palace yesterday, and the foreign affairs officials held separate meetings. Rumors that the meeting will result in a direct movement for war are not widely believed. A newspaper in Oslo stated that any peace movement must await the response of the parties concerned before it can be launched, otherwise it will only undermine the hope of ending the war early on a fair basis. The Nordic countries should seize this excellent opportunity to awaken and fulfill their duties. The capitals of the Nordic countries are now flying flags to celebrate the meeting. Scandinavian churches are currently praying for peace. The Swedish King hosted a banquet for the dignitaries at the palace last night. (19th Reuters dispatch)

Stockholm, Sweden. The Nordic conference held in Stockholm yesterday by the Kings of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, and the President of Finland, has achieved the following three results: continuing the four countries' strict neutrality policy of recent months, consulting with each other on all important issues; concerning economic issues, the four countries are united, supporting each other and issuing a joint statement declaring this determination; the four countries will issue a joint broadcast speech to the world, expressing the desire to end the war for humanitarian reasons, but will not take any peace movement other than the declaration. If the warring parties express their approval of this step, the four Nordic countries will consider concrete actions. (19th Haitong dispatch)

Washington. The heads of the four Nordic countries held a meeting in Stockholm, Sweden, today to discuss relations between the Soviet Union and Finland, as well as general international issues. President Roosevelt cabled King Gustaf V of Sweden, stating, "My government and people will watch the work of your conference with great interest. My country is willing to join the governments of the American republics in declaring its full support for the principles of neutrality and order, which have been adhered to by the Nordic peoples throughout their history." The heads of the other twenty American republics are also reported to have sent similar cables to the King of Sweden. Diplomatic circles here commented that when the Pan-American Conference recently met in Panama City, the American republics decided to take a unified stance on the European situation. This matter is the first manifestation of this. As for President Roosevelt, he cabled Soviet Central Executive Committee Chairman Kalinin on the 12th of this month, in a personal capacity, to call for peace between the Soviet Union and Finland. This is the second expression of this. (18th Havas dispatch)

Paris. The conference held by the heads of the four Nordic countries of Europe, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland, in Stockholm, Sweden, has been commented on by political figures here as saying that the solidarity of neutral countries around the world is becoming increasingly close, and the expression of support from the governments of the American countries is a clear demonstration. The details of the conference are not yet known, but it is said that public opinion in Finland has greatly stabilized due to the spiritual support it has received from the United States and the Nordic countries, and it is believed that a compromise solution can be reached in the negotiations between the country and the Soviet Union. As for the counter-proposal that Finland will submit to the Soviet Union, it will be discussed by the four Nordic countries' conference, so that its representative, Passikivi, can take it to Moscow on the 20th or 21st of this month. It is said that the content is to cede the four small islands in the Gulf of Finland to the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union should also revise the borders of certain places between the Soviet Union and Finland as an exchange condition. However, the two proposals of the Soviet Union to sign a mutual assistance treaty with Finland and to establish military bases in Finland are enough to hinder Finland's neutrality and cause the opposition of the other three Nordic countries, so it is not appropriate to accept them. (18th Havas dispatch)

Paris. The heads of the Nordic countries have been holding a meeting in Stockholm, Sweden, since yesterday, and the newspapers here have been paying close attention to it. The Socialist People's Daily reported, "Although we have not received any news about the progress of the conference, it can be asserted that Germany's hope that the Nordic countries will act as mediators will surely be in vain. Sweden, Denmark, and Norway have once again firmly declared that they have a bond with Finland, and Finland's own attitude is also very firm. In addition, US President Roosevelt's cable to the Soviet authorities calling for peace will inevitably affect the Soviet Union's attitude. In short, the current negotiations between Finland and the Soviet Union may drag on, but the fate that Finland may suffer will be different from that of the Baltic countries." The radical Socialist Business Daily reported, "There are two important facts: one is that the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula have no intention of acting as mediators in the European war, and the other is that although the Soviet Union has made harsh demands on Finland, the country will be able to find a way to reach an understanding with it without resorting to force. Although Soviet Central Executive Committee Chairman Kalinin's reply to US President Roosevelt is ambiguous, the danger that the Soviet government will abandon its clever diplomatic approach and take the approach of national socialism no longer exists. In short, the Soviet Union will definitely avoid war in the Nordic region, and German Chancellor Hitler's intended plan will thus be greatly hindered." (19th Havas dispatch)

London. According to Rome Radio, the Soviet government is now seeking to have Finnish chief representative Paasikivi return to Moscow. It is reported that after meeting with the Soviet authorities, Paasikivi recently returned to Helsinki to report to his government on the details of the various demands made by the Soviet Union on Finland. (19th Reuters dispatch)

Washington. President Roosevelt today received a cable from Finnish President Kallio, expressing Finland's gratitude for the sympathy and spiritual support given by the US President and people to Finland in its current difficult situation. It stated, "Finland's fate and its difficult problems are receiving your valuable assistance and attention, and the Finnish people will never forget this." (18th Reuters dispatch)

### Germany's Utmost Efforts to Investigate; Location of British Fleet; Another British Ship Sunk by Submarine; Roosevelt Bans Submarines from Territorial Waters

London: Well-informed sources here claim that Germany's repeated reports of great success in attacking the British naval fleet are intended to exaggerate the victory of German military force, to deceive neutral countries, to encourage the German people, and to induce the disclosure of the whereabouts of the so-called "attacked" ships. The German naval authorities are eager to find out the current deployment of British battleships, battlecruisers, and aircraft carriers. Therefore, the British Admiralty has generally ignored repeated German propaganda, except for denials, to avoid any leakage. So far, the confirmed losses of the British side are the aircraft carrier "Courageous" and the battleship "Oak." The "Oak" sank at night, resulting in the deaths of 810 crew members. In addition, the "Iron Duke," converted into a training ship, suffered minor damage. As for the result of the German air raid on Rosyth, 28 British naval officers and soldiers were killed or wounded, but there was no significant material damage. To date, Germany has lost 18 submarines, of which 13 have sunk and 5 have been severely damaged and are likely to have sunk. (Reuters, 19th)

London: According to official sources, between the 7th and 14th of this month, British warships intercepted a total of 23,000 tons of contraband destined for Germany, bringing the total to 338,000 tons since the start of the war six weeks ago. (Havas, 19th)

London: Yesterday, German aircraft were again seen flying near Scapa Flow from the direction of Kirkwall and Duncansby Head in Britain, apparently for reconnaissance, but they did not drop bombs. (Reuters, 19th)

London: The Air Ministry has just announced that several enemy aircraft, presumably reconnaissance planes, flew near Scapa Bay this afternoon and then flew towards Kirkwall and Duncansby Head (both in northern Scotland) without dropping bombs. (Havas, 18th)

Copenhagen, Denmark: According to news from Washington, U.S. naval experts are extremely puzzled by the German sinking of several British naval vessels and believe that Germany has invented a new type of torpedo with automatic firing mechanisms at any depth, hence the accuracy of the shots. (Haitong, 19th)

Copenhagen, Denmark: Residents of Langø Island heard heavy artillery fire coming from the direction of Kiel, Germany, all day yesterday. (Havas, 19th)

London: Officials have just announced that two German airmen, drifting in a rubber boat, landed on the coast of Wittby in the North Sea this morning. One of them had severely injured legs. They are two of the four airmen from the German bomber that was shot down yesterday while bombing the Firth of Forth in Scotland. The other two are dead. (Havas, 19th)

Gibraltar: The British ship "York" (10,000 tons) was sunk yesterday by a German submarine 200 miles off Cape Finisterre in northwestern Spain in the Atlantic Ocean. The American mail ship "Independence Hall" immediately sailed to the rescue after receiving the alert. A radio report from the ship stated that a total of 223 crew members and passengers had been rescued, and 60 people were still missing and their fate unknown. (Havas, 18th)

Washington: The Naval Affairs Committee here issued a bulletin stating that another British ship had been sunk by a German submarine. The American ship "Independence Hall," sailing back to New York from Bordeaux, rescued 300 passengers about 500 miles west of the French coast, including not only passengers from the "City of Mandalay" but also passengers from the 10,000-ton British ship "Yorkshire." (Reuters, 19th)

Washington: President Roosevelt issued an order yesterday prohibiting submarines of all belligerent countries from entering U.S. territorial waters and ports. It stated: "In accordance with neutrality, submarines of the four countries of Great Britain, France, Germany, and Poland, as well as India, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of Canada, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa, shall not enter U.S. territorial waters and ports, except for the Panama Canal Zone. Submarines of the above countries may be allowed to enter in the event of irresistible force majeure, provided they fly their national flag and navigate on the surface. Our competent authorities shall closely monitor our territorial waters and ports. Submarines of belligerent countries that violate this ban shall be detained pending court proceedings." (Havas, 19th)

Bulgaria

Cabinet Reshuffle

Sofia, Bulgaria: The G. Kiosseivanov cabinet has submitted its resignation to King Boris III, who immediately commissioned him to form a new cabinet. This was planned several days ago, as Prime Minister Kiosseivanov wants to broaden the base of the new cabinet by attracting key figures from certain political parties before the parliament reconvenes. It is rumored that after the new cabinet is formed, it will submit a motion to parliament requesting full powers. (Havas, 19th)

Soviet Troops Enter Estonian Territory in Two Routes

Moscow: According to "Pravda," Soviet troops began entering Estonia on Monday (the 16th) in two routes: one departing from Leningrad and advancing towards Tallinn, and the other departing from Pskov and advancing towards Tartu. The majority of the Soviet troops were armored vehicles and mechanized infantry. Representatives of the Estonian motorcade welcomed them at the border. The Soviet troops immediately proceeded to the Soviet garrison fortresses stipulated in the Soviet-Estonian Mutual Assistance Treaty. (Haitong, 19th)

Papal Nuncio Presents Credentials

Vatican City: The new Lithuanian Envoy to the Holy See, Mr. Kantvanias, visited Pope Pius XII at Castel Gandolfo yesterday to present his credentials. Pope Pius XII said in his address that he was very pleased to restore diplomatic relations with Lithuania at a time of dramatic political change in Europe. Lithuania's position is nothing less than the outpost of Catholicism in Northern Europe. The restoration of friendly relations between government and religion truly shows Lithuania's confidence in sacrificing for its mission. Our only mission is to save the souls of the world. At present, all countries are engaged in war for the sake of territorial disputes. We can hardly tolerate witnessing this dangerous situation. Our duty does not allow us to stand idly by. Europe is based on Christianity. At this juncture, only protecting Christianity is the decisive element for the fate of Europe and the welfare of its people. (Haitong, 19th)

### Mutual Assistance Pact Signed by Britain, France, and Turkey Yesterday; Tripartite Staff Talks Begin; Soviet-Turkish Negotiations Stalled Due to German Interference

Paris: It has been learned that the Mutual Assistance Pact between Britain, France, and Turkey will be signed this evening in the Turkish capital. (Havas, 19th)

Paris: Consultations on the Mutual Assistance Pact between Britain, France, and Turkey have been ongoing for six months and can now be signed this evening in the Turkish capital. On May 12th of this year, Britain and Turkey jointly issued a declaration stating that the two sides had established contact. France and Turkey also issued a similar declaration on June 23rd. This is the first step in establishing a Mutual Assistance Pact to confirm that all parties wish to maintain public safety through mutual security and assistance. Subsequently, the governments of the respective countries conducted negotiations to prepare for the signing of a Mutual Assistance Pact, which had already achieved satisfactory results three weeks ago. However, due to waiting for Turkey to establish a parallel agreement with the Soviet Union within the scope of not violating common positions and current international obligations, it was decided to postpone the signing. Now that Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu has suspended negotiations and returned to his country two days ago due to new demands from the Soviet government, Britain, France, and Turkey have decided to establish a Mutual Assistance Pact this evening. It is appropriate to confirm that the ideals pursued and the interests maintained by the respective countries in Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean are all the same. (Havas, 19th)

Paris: Official sources here say that the British-French-Turkish agreement will be signed in Ankara this evening. According to news from Istanbul, the agreement between the three countries will be signed in Ankara at 6:00 p.m. today. (Reuters, 19th)

Ankara, Turkey: Former French Chief of the Army Staff General Weygand and British General Wavell arrived here yesterday by plane. After disembarking, they visited Turkish Chief of Staff General Fevzi Çakmak and Defense Minister Naci Tınaz. The Turkish Chief of Staff and Defense Minister then returned the visit at their hotel. Staff talks began at 10:00 a.m. today. It is reported that French General Weygand and British General Wavell are scheduled to return home on the 21st. (Haitong, 19th)

Ankara: Lieutenant General Wavell, Commander of the British Army in the Near East, and General Weygand, former French Chief of Staff, immediately met with the Turkish Chief of Staff and the Minister of Defense after arriving here. It is expected that military staff talks will begin today. (Reuters, 19th)

Rome: Diplomatic circles here recently stated that the failure of the Soviet-Turkish negotiations is of extreme importance in terms of the European situation. In a nutshell, it means that Turkey is adhering to its commitments to Britain and France and is unwilling to embrace Germany and the Soviet Union, as some related parties are promoting. As for the reason for the failure of the negotiations, as far as is known here, the Soviet Union demanded that Turkey block the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus Straits, preventing warships from non-Black Sea countries from entering and exiting. Turkey is determined to maintain its freedom of action, and the two sides disagreed, leading to the suspension of negotiations. Considering that Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu was able to resolutely decide to suspend negotiations under the current European situation, it is sufficient to prove that Turkey can maintain its independent position in military and political affairs, and that it is unwilling to accept any obligations to the Soviet Union, thereby violating its commitments to Britain and France (the Mutual Assistance Agreement between the three countries is about to be signed). It is also clear that the tone of the communique issued by the Soviet government is quite difficult, and it has implicitly acknowledged the breakdown of negotiations. The sudden return of German Ambassador to Turkey, Franz von Papen, to Berlin must be related to the failure of the Soviet-Turkish negotiations, which can be asserted. As for the impact of Turkey's attitude on the international community, it is extremely important to Italy. Italy originally believed that the establishment of a security agreement between Turkey and Western European countries was not only a response to the intimidation policies imposed by Germany on small and medium-sized countries, but also threatened Italy's interests in the Eastern Mediterranean. Later, the situation took a sharp turn for the worse. After the Soviet Union and Germany concluded a non-aggression pact, they expanded their influence into Central and Southeastern Europe, and the European situation changed suddenly. The Italian government's perspective on Turkey's position has also changed accordingly. (Havas, 18th)

Paris: It is reported here that the interruption of the Soviet-Turkish negotiations in Moscow was due to interference by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. Semi-official sources in Paris said that Turkey's policy towards Moscow and Western European countries once seemed to have a chance of reconciliation, mainly concerning issues related to the Near East and the Balkan Peninsula. However, the Soviet Union, at the urging of a third country, suddenly proposed suggestions outside the basic structure of Soviet-Turkish relations, leading to the suspension of negotiations. When the German Foreign Minister visited Moscow, the Balkan issue had not been resolved. It is believed that after the German Foreign Minister arrived, he immediately intervened. Although the Moscow negotiations have stopped, Soviet-Turkish relations remain harmonious, which Paris welcomes. France deeply appreciates Turkey's priority in adhering to its promises to France and Britain. It is believed that these promises will soon be confirmed by the signing of a tripartite convention. (Reuters, 19th)

London: It is expected here that when Romania is invaded, Turkey will not only come to Romania's aid on its own, but will also accommodate British and French naval assistance to Romania. Because Romania has obtained the assistance of Britain, France, and Turkey, its attitude towards Germany will become much tougher. At the same time, Turkey will prevent Bulgaria from embracing Germany and the Soviet Union. At the same time, Balkan countries may have the possibility of forming a neutral group under the influence of Britain, France, and Italy. (Associated Press, 19th)

Rome: Italian newspapers' comments on the new situation after Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu left Moscow are clearly contrary to the views of Britain and France. The Rome "Il Popolo" correspondent in the Turkish capital pointed out that political figures in Ankara believe that Soviet-Turkish negotiations will continue in the near future. The correspondent claimed that semi-official communiqués have already confirmed this possibility. The semi-official newspaper "Ulus" stated that Soviet-Turkish relations will continue to be maintained on a friendly basis, and there are no conflicting political goals between the two countries. (Haitong, 19th)

Paris: According to reliable sources today, Turkey is now willing to sign the treaty initiated three weeks ago with Britain and France. The result of this treaty will not only affect military affairs but also finance and economy. It is reported that the conditions are as follows: (1) Adopt automatic mutual assistance in the Eastern Mediterranean; (2) When Britain and France fulfill their obligations to Romania and Greece, Turkey can sympathize with Poland's suffering; (3) Negotiate on Balkan events. (Associated Press, 19th)

Berlin: Newspapers here, commenting on Turkish Foreign Minister's departure from Moscow, stated that Moscow had given Turkey an indirect warning, urging it to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union. Newspapers here said that Turkey's relationship with the Soviet Union is extremely important to Turkey. As for Turkey's desire to establish an agreement with Western European countries, it will inevitably conflict with the relationship between the Soviet Union and Turkey. If Turkey is obsessed and insists on forming a military alliance with Western European countries, then various problems and dangers will inevitably arise. (Associated Press, 19th)

### French Government; Council of State

Paris: Today's cabinet meeting, chaired by President Lebrun, approved the order that French women who have lost their nationality due to marriage may still restore their nationality, and the law on children of foreigners born in France requesting to join French nationality. French Prime Minister Daladier reviewed the military and diplomatic situation, with special mention of the happy results of the British-French-Turkish negotiations. (Reuters, 19th)

Paris: The cabinet held a Council of State meeting this morning, chaired by President Lebrun. Prime Minister Daladier immediately gave a speech, reporting that the ongoing negotiations between Britain, France, and Turkey had achieved an agreement that could be signed in the Turkish capital this evening. He then explained the diplomatic and military situation, paying close attention to the recent offensives launched by the German army on the Western Front and the situation of Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu's talks in Moscow. Other ministers then spoke, reporting on the work of their respective departments and submitting several orders on routine matters for the Council of State to approve. (Havas, 19th)

### Soviet-Latvian Trade Agreement Signed; Trade Between the Two Countries to Triple

Moscow: The Soviet-Latvian trade agreement for 1939-40 was signed yesterday by Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Trade Zhukoyan and Latvian Minister Cersis. The agreement stipulates that the trade volume between the Soviet Union and Latvia should be tripled compared to the past, with a total amount of six million Latvian lats. In addition, the Soviet Union will allow Latvian goods to be transported through Soviet railways and waterways to Archangelsk, Yaroslavl, and Black Sea ports for export. Latvia will also allow the amount of Soviet goods exported through Latvian seaports to increase. (TASS, 19th)

### Turkish Minister of Agriculture Arrives in Soviet Union

Moscow: Turkish Minister of Agriculture Erkmen, along with entourage Parliamentarian Eşref Ülken and female writer Delvina arrived here yesterday to visit the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition. Those who welcomed them at the station included Soviet Deputy People's Commissar of Agriculture Vassin, Director of the Protocol Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs Bakov, Acting Chairman of the All-Union Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Smirnov, Turkish Ambassador Yaktai, and all members of the embassy. (TASS, 19th)

### British Government Considers Trade with Soviet Union

London: Regarding British-Soviet trade relations, economic circles here generally believe that Britain should purchase various raw materials from the Soviet Union to prevent the country from supplying Germany. However, the export of British goods to the Soviet Union should be carefully considered to avoid the country transferring them to Germany. This issue is being carefully considered by the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Wartime Economy, and the Foreign Office. They plan to determine what kind of British goods the Soviet Union needs and the quantity of each, and then prepare to conclude an agreement with them and send an economic delegation to Moscow for formal negotiations. (Havas, 19th)

### Soviet Delegation Arrives in Lithuania

Kaunas, Lithuania: The Soviet delegation arrived here today and will immediately implement the Mutual Assistance Treaty established between the Soviet Union and Lithuania. (Havas, 19th)

Kaunas, Lithuania: After Lithuania regained the Vilnius region, the Council of State decided to issue a special public bond of 50,000,000 litas. The denominations of this bond are from 25 to 1,000 litas, with an interest rate of 4.5% and a term of ten years. (Haitong, 19th)

### Withdrawal of Germans from the Baltic Coast; Postponement of Deportation of Germans from Lithuania

Kaunas: The German government has now postponed the repatriation of a small number of German nationals in Lithuania. According to the German government, this postponement is to study the experiences gained from the withdrawal of German nationals from Estonia and Latvia. However, according to people here, the social and financial status of German nationals in Lithuania is not as high as that of German nationals elsewhere. It is difficult for Germany to clear the withdrawal procedures, and there are few opportunities that are beneficial to Germany. Moreover, many German nationals in Lithuania oppose the withdrawal, especially those who have lived in Lithuania for a long time. These are all reasons why Germany has temporarily not withdrawn its nationals. (Reuters, 19th)

Helsinki: The German representative in Finland has notified 4,000 Germans here, hoping that they will immediately return to their country by ship. It is reported that most of the Germans in Finland are artists, technicians, scientists, and businessmen, all of whom carry German passports. These people felt quite shocked after receiving this notice, because these people have huge investments in Finland, and most of the large Finnish companies are controlled by Germans. Germans have been involved in the development and operation of Finnish industries for centuries. In recent years, relations between the two countries have increased. Most of the various foreign goods used in Finland are also supplied by Germany. (Reuters, 19th)

Berlin: According to one estimate, the property owned by Germans in Estonia is worth approximately 500,000,000 marks. Before leaving the country, these people were given written instructions by the German authorities, stating: "The furniture and other property of Germans should be transported only after finding a new address. All bank deposits and the proceeds from the sale of real estate must be allocated depending on the balance of payments in the German-Estonian clearing agreement." In addition, the total amount of property of Germans in Lithuania has not yet been calculated. It will be transferred to the German authorities through the Latvian bank in Riga in the future. (Havas, 19th)

### German Jews Immigrate to Fiji

Washington: The International Committee for Political Refugees in Ba decided to immediately start permanently resettling a large number of German Jews in the Philippine Islands and the Dominican Republic, and Jews currently living in neutral countries will be resettled first. It was also decided that German Jews who have fled from Poland to Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland should be given priority. The chairman of the meeting and the representative of the Central Government, Winterton, and the French representative both stated that although there are thousands of Jews in Britain and France, the Jewish question in Britain and France is not as urgent, so they agreed to the decision on this priority. (Reuters, 19th)

### Romania Monitors Polish Commander

Bucharest: According to a statement here today, the Romanian authorities are unwilling to allow former Polish Marshal Śmigły-Rydz to go to Herculane Baths (many former Polish government officials have fled to this area). They stated that in order to maintain strict neutrality, Romania had to reject his request. Śmigły-Rydz is currently in Craiova, living in Prince Bibescu's residence with Colonel Wenda and a doctor, as well as four chauffeurs. Local police are protecting him (in fact, monitoring his actions). Apart from the governor, mayor, and police chief, he is not allowed to meet with others, or even drive out or dine at city restaurants, but he is allowed to read foreign newspapers and listen to broadcasts. (Haitong, 19th)

### Italy Has Not Proposed Peace Suggestion

Rome: After the new Italian Ambassador to Britain, Bastianini, visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday afternoon, government authorities here issued a statement stating that Ambassador Bastianini's move was purely a courtesy call upon arrival and did not carry any plans from Prime Minister Mussolini regarding the current situation, nor did he propose any notes. According to foreign observers, this official statement is intended to deny rumors that Italy intends to propose peace suggestions to Britain. (Havas, 18th)

### Hungarian Right-Wingers Plot to Form Labor State

Budapest: Regarding the rumors circulating in Hungary and abroad in recent days about a planned coup by Hungarian right-wing radicals, officials here acknowledged it last night. According to official sources, members of the now-disbanded "Hungarian Action Party" in Hungary have recently been distributing propaganda leaflets in Budapest and other places. The language is still moderate. After learning about this, the authorities investigated the hiding places of these party members. As a result, they found the printing press used to print the propaganda in Budapest and captured more than 30 printing workers on the spot. They learned that the party members were led by Colonel Szálasi, and their goal was to establish a "Hungarian Labor State," and they would not hesitate to take terrorist measures to achieve this goal. Some of the rumors abroad are inevitably exaggerated, and it is hoped that all sectors will not easily believe them. (Haitong, 19th)

### Egyptian Envoy to Turkey Promoted to Ambassador

Cairo: According to "Al-Mokattam," the Egyptian government has approved a resolution to upgrade the Egyptian legation in Turkey to an embassy and establish Egyptian legations in Romania and Afghanistan. (Haitong, 19th)

### Central England Suffers from Heavy Rain

Brussels: Central England has been hit by torrential rain, and floods have inundated hundreds of square miles, causing considerable damage. The canal area has been hit hard, with high water levels, and people have climbed onto rooftops to avoid drowning. (Haitong, 19th)

### British Authorities Explain India Protection Plan

London. Secretary of State for India Zetland explained in the House of Lords today the reasons why foreign troops stationed in India had been dispatched to Singapore, Egypt, and Aden several weeks ago. He said that this measure was adopted after the urgent advice of the highest military authorities of the army and navy. At that time, the security of India seemed to be threatened from both the east and west. From a military point of view, it was necessary to adequately defend the areas leading to India from both the east and west. It would have been foolish to discuss this in Parliament at the time and to inform the world in advance of British military deployments. However, the Governor-General of India, trusting the leaders of various political parties, informed them of this plan, he said. (Reuters, 18th)

### German Delegation Arrives in Moscow

Moscow. A delegation from the German government, led by Counselor Gan Fiefen, arrived here yesterday to negotiate the withdrawal of German citizens from western Ukraine and western Belarus, as well as the resettlement of Germanic people voluntarily moving to Germany. (TASS, 18th)

### Japan and Iran Sign Friendship Treaty

Iranian Capital. It was announced here today that the friendship treaty between Japan and Iran was signed last night. (Reuters, 19th)

### US Navy and Army Draft National Defense Budget; Air Force Will Surpass Any Country

New York. The New York Sun reports that the US government will ask Congress during the next congressional session to approve an astonishing national defense budget, amounting to nearly $40 billion. The Army and Navy have now obtained the President's approval and are starting to draft the largest peacetime national defense budget in history. It is said that this budget will be based on the Western Hemisphere defense plan, with special attention paid to the Army. The Army is now forming a new air squadron of 500 super bombers. These super bombers have longer ranges, larger bodies, and higher speeds than existing "Flying Fortresses." In addition, there are 6,000 aircraft recently approved by Congress. From now on, the US Air Force will be superior to any country in the world. In addition to the Army's expansion, there is also a shipbuilding program. (Reuters, 18th)

### US-China Legislation Amendment: Navigation Clause Amendment Principles Established

Washington. According to yesterday's news, thirteen Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have agreed to the amendment principles for the navigation restriction in the Neutrality Act amendment. After this amendment, American merchant ships can conduct commercial exchanges with belligerent countries in the Pacific and South Atlantic, but not including munitions. Texas Democratic Senator Connally said that there is no concrete amendment yet, but the new amendment must be based on the above principles. Members of the Foreign Relations Committee are willing to abolish the restrictions on navigation in the Pacific, the China Sea, the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the South Atlantic. Connally also said that the new plan may include a "combat zone" clause, allowing the President to restrict American merchant ships from navigating in this area when he deems it necessary. (Associated Press, 19th)

New York. The New York Post commented on the twenty senators who oppose the abolition of the arms embargo, who have preemptively declared their intention to speak and debate in Congress in order to delay the matter, saying that such remarks, in any case, only prolong the situation and make the opposition party bear the responsibility of maintaining the original plan, which benefits Germany. At this time, German planes are bombing Scotland and Soviet spokesmen are deceiving the democratic countries of Scandinavia. How can the opposition party still engage in obstruction? (Reuters, 18th)

### US Army Department Issues Sealed Orders

Minnesota, USA. According to news from here today, the US Army Department has issued sealed military supply orders to 127 factories in Minnesota. These sealed orders are now being kept unopened in the safes of the factories. Therefore, their nature is unknown, even to the factory owners and authorities. These orders are intended to be rushed into production only in times of war emergency. It is reported that these orders have now been received by factories in all 48 states of the United States. However, they are not allowed to open the contents of the orders until they receive instructions from the Army Department. Only when an emergency arises will the factory owners be notified by telegram, newspaper, or radio broadcast to promptly manufacture and deliver these emergency orders, according to the degree of need. Although all factories in this state have received orders, they do not know their contents. They only know that the orders they have received must be for goods that they can manufacture, such as small arms, woolen goods, bridge materials, shipbuilding materials, and other supplies needed during wartime. According to the Army Department, there are 58 factories in the Minneapolis area, 31 in St. Paul, and 18 in Duluth. It is reported that among these 127 factories, three specialize in manufacturing naval supplies, and the other 124 manufacture army supplies. (Associated Press, 19th)

New York. According to responsible sources, the British and French governments are prepared to purchase an additional 5,750 military aircraft from the United States, worth $350 million, after the arms embargo clause of the Neutrality Act is lifted. It is reported that if the arms embargo cannot be lifted, Britain will invite American factories to set up branch plants in Canada. (Reuters, 19th)

The ship is carrying 350 passengers and will soon proceed to Hong Kong. The Empress of Japan is the first ship of the British firm Butterfield & Swire to arrive in Japan armed since the outbreak of the war in Europe. (19th)

We urgently correct this.

### Torrential Rain on the Western Front; Initial Stage of War Concludes; Germany Claims Initiative Hereafter; Diplomatic Activities Still Said to be Underway

Paris. Torrential rain on the Western Front hinders land operations. The Rhine River is high, and the sound of pumps draining water from the Siegfried Line can be faintly heard. Currently, the soil has been soaked by the rainy summer, making a vigorous offensive difficult. In addition, ongoing diplomatic activities may also postpone a new offensive. (Reuters, 18th)

Berlin. The High Command issued a communiqué today stating that the first act of the Western Front war has ended. After a short battle between the Saar River and the Hohnbach-Bitsch highway, German troops drove enemy troops still occupying German territory beyond the border. Only local artillery battles and reconnaissance activities occurred in other parts of the front. German troops made contact with enemy troops in several locations, but soon retreated because German sentries did not cross the border. (Reuters, 19th)

Berlin. This afternoon, the German High Command issued a war report stating that enemy outposts had remained on German territory between the Saar River and the Hohnbach-Bitche highway. After fierce fighting, the German army repelled them. The first stage of the Western Front war can be said to have ended. Since the beginning of the war, the French army has been on the offensive on the Western Front. The situation will change from now on, and the war will enter its second stage. The past Western Front war can be summarized as follows: After the outbreak of the German-Polish War, the French army forcibly occupied many German defensive works on the Western Front. On September 9, the French army entered German territory, but the fighting was not fierce. The locations of the battles were all in front of the Siegfried Line, not far from the French positions. The area occupied by French troops in September was not very large. Broadly speaking, it can be divided into three zones: (1) German villages near the Luxembourg border and Saarbrücken, all very close to the French border; (2) mountainous areas southwest of Saarbrücken, protruding into French territory; (3) areas southeast of Saarbrücken, between the Saar River and the Philzer Forest, protruding into French territory. The area occupied by the enemy in each zone was only three to five kilometers. They gained little and lost much. Now the French army can no longer retain even this small area. Apart from this, no French troops set foot on German territory in front of the Siegfried Line. In short, there was no significant activity from the artillery and infantry on the Western Front. (Haitong, 18th)

Paris. The High Command issued War Report No. 90, stating, "Last night, there was torrential rain on the front lines. Except for enemy infantry units being repelled in a certain area, everything else was calm." (Havas, 19th)

Paris. The High Command issued War Report No. 89, stating, "Our reconnaissance units were very active between the Moselle and Saar Rivers today. There were no changes on the entire front." (Havas, 18th)

Paris. Military experts observing the Western Front have praised the French authorities' strategy in the past few days. The military operations are completely in line with the French commander's plans. Some places are resisting the German army with all their might, not yielding an inch of land. Others are withdrawing according to military orders. Everyone is acting according to military orders. As for the rumored threat of the German heavy tank unit equipped with six-inch guns, the French do not attach importance to it. These tanks cannot carry much ammunition and must stop to aim. French heavy artillery can easily destroy them. Or it is said that the Germans will use a large number of aircraft to attack. It should be known that the Maginot Line is very different from the Polish Line. Even the largest bombs cannot destroy it. Low-flying enemy planes will only be shot down by machine guns. (Reuters, 19th)

Berlin. This afternoon's German war report stated that German losses on the Western Front, from the beginning of the war until the 17th of this month, were 196 dead, 356 wounded, and 110 missing. The German army lost a total of eleven aircraft. Enemy aircraft shot down by the German army numbered as many as sixty, including eleven British aircraft, all shot down on the Western Front. The German army captured 25 French officers and soldiers. (Haitong, 19th)

London. Military experts here predict that the next German offensive will be in the 15-mile plain between the Rhine and Wissembourg. Although there are forests interspersed, it is still quite open. Recently, French reconnaissance units have been very active in this area. The area between Pirmasens and Mannheim is almost entirely industrial, with many roads, which is quite convenient for the German advance. However, the French artillery has made very accurate measurements of this area in the first few weeks of the war. As for other areas, the mountains rise and fall, and the forests are dense, especially between the Saar and the Moselle. According to Luxembourg news, the Moselle River has risen, and neighboring villages have been flooded. It is reported that the Germans are now making every effort to strengthen the Siegfried Line opposite Luxembourg, digging deep trenches and setting up strong barbed wire. (Reuters, 19th)

Paris. Semi-official sources here recently commented on the situation of the war between France and Germany, saying that after the sudden flooding of the Rhine River, a new factor has been discovered in the current war. The riverbed of this river has changed since dikes were built on both sides at the end of the last century. Whenever the river floods, it seeps into the plains. To this point, the defensive works of France and Germany are in danger of being submerged. However, the defensive works built by Germany are much lower than those of France. The French positions remain dry as before, while the German positions have been flooded and are being pumped out with giant pumps. The sound can also be heard in the French positions. In addition, the war report issued today by the French High Command stated that it has returned to calm between the Moselle and Rhine Rivers, which shows that Germany has no intention of continuing its offensive for the time being. Many of the positions recaptured by the French army have also been lost and regained. The German army seems to be busy consolidating its positions. (Havas, 19th)

Luxembourg. The German Western Front was calm last night. At ten o'clock this morning, German artillery resumed bombarding the city of Perl in the Saar region (located near the border of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg) and the highway from that city to the city of Schengen. (Havas, 19th)

### Zhang Qun Talks to American Reporters; Chinese People Optimistic About War Results; Japan's Losses Greater in the Past Two Years; International Position Also Very Complicated

Chongqing. Zhang Qun, Secretary-General of the Supreme National Defense Council, told reporters today, "Neither China nor Japan can achieve a definitive military victory in the war of resistance against Japan. But when the Japanese feel that their attempt to conquer China is futile, that is the day China achieves true victory." The National Defense Council concentrates all the government's diplomatic, financial, and other affairs, in addition to planning military strategies. Zhang Qun handles this complex organization in an orderly manner. Zhang Qun stated that the Chinese people are optimistic about the outcome of the war because Japan is gradually weakening. He said, "Japan's losses in the past two years of the Sino-Japanese War have been greater than China's. This can be seen from the fact that the China policy of each new wartime cabinet in Japan is softening." Zhang Qun believes that although the Japanese Abe cabinet has stated that it will strive to end the "China Incident," it will begin to find it extremely impossible to defeat China. "Japan faces four difficulties in conquering China: morale, manpower, money, and munitions. The morale of the Japanese people cannot withstand the difficulties of a long-term war, while China is determined to continue fighting until it shatters Japan's attempt to turn China into a Japanese colony. Moreover, Japan's manpower is not inexhaustible. According to general estimates, Japan can conscript 4.5 million soldiers, of which one million have already been killed or wounded in China. In addition, it must be noted that Japan's military strength must not only cope with the war of aggression against China, but also defend the border of 'Manchukuo.' Currently, several elite divisions of the Japanese army are stationed on the border of 'Manchukuo.' It is obvious that Japan's economic situation is weakening due to the extension of the war. Japan is a highly industrialized country and must rely on foreign trade to purchase the raw materials it needs. Moreover, Japan has drawn young men from factories to serve in the military due to the war, all of which have caused its foreign trade to collapse. The outbreak of the European war has given Japan an opportunity to restore its economic strength, but if Japan continues to fight with China, it will still lose this opportunity. Japan must maintain its foreign markets and purchase raw materials from abroad in order to be able to manufacture munitions and other necessities for the war. The source of these raw materials is decreasing day by day, which is a very serious problem for Japan at present." Zhang Qun also pointed out that Japan's current international position is also very complicated. Zhang Qun said, "Our only enemy is Japan, and Japan has few true friends in the international community. Japan itself can hardly believe that it has any true friends. Japan's war in China disregards the interests of various countries in China and seeks to dominate Asia alone, which is also one of the reasons why it has fallen into its current state of weakness." Zhang Qun continued that he was unwilling to conceal China's difficulties and weaknesses, but they are extremely small compared to Japan's dangers. Therefore, this war is actually beneficial to China. Zhang Qun did not say when the war could end, only that China must be prepared for a long-term war if necessary. No matter when the war ends, it will never end because China is defeated. (Associated Press Far East Manager Maurice, 19th)

### Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation

Chongqing. Weekly war situation (October 11 to 17). A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that the Japanese army in northern Hunan is showing signs of exhaustion after suffering a devastating blow last week. There have been fierce battles on the remaining north-south battlefields. It is worth reporting that the Japanese army in southeastern Jin was killed or wounded more than ten thousand, creating the second great victory in that area. Regarding the course of the battle, the important ones are as follows: (Jin-Yu Area) The war in Jin Province has gradually become more intense recently. The Japanese army trapped in Changzhi, Changzi, and Huguan in southeastern Jin has been massively reinforced by Doyang Pass and the Baijin Highway since last week, with a total of 20,000 infantry and cavalry, 70-80 mountain and field guns, 130-140 tanks, and more than 20 aircraft for cover, and launched another fierce attack on the Chinese side. After resisting them on multiple routes, the Japanese army was surrounded in the valleys of Yin City Town, Shaojia Mountain, Muzhe Town, and Yi Town, and was severely annihilated, killing or wounding more than ten thousand Japanese soldiers. By dawn on the 11th, the Japanese abandoned more than 5,000 corpses and retreated along the original route, and they are still being pursued fiercely. The Japanese army in Yicheng and Wenxi in southern Jin has been attacked by the Chinese army for days, and they have captured a lot of spoils. After the right wing recovered Wushan, it continued to advance towards Jicheng, and the left wing also captured important strongholds one after another. In eastern Henan, the Chinese army has been attacking Huaiyang fiercely for days, and once rushed into the city, killing many Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese have shown signs of wavering and have a tendency to flee elsewhere. (Hunan-Jiangxi Area)

(Hunan-Jiangxi Area) Five hundred Japanese soldiers from Nanchang in Jiangxi Province invaded the Tianwangdu and Xishanlu areas on the 12th, while more than 20 tanks harassed the area north of Xincunwei. After resisting them on multiple routes, the Japanese army was repelled, and many tanks were destroyed. Shenqiao, northeast of Gaoan, was recaptured by the Chinese army again on the morning of the 12th, and then Zhangshuling was captured in the afternoon. Daheling and Mize were recaptured on the 13th, killing many Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army west of Fengxin has been severely attacked by the Chinese army for days. Wubucheng was captured on the morning of the 16th, and continued to advance fiercely. Daxinling was captured in the afternoon, and the county seat was surrounded on three sides. The remaining Japanese launched desperate counterattacks, but were repelled. They are still under siege. Another part of the Chinese army advanced towards the county seat of Wuning. After the Japanese army in northern Hunan retreated to the north bank of the Xinqiang River last week, the Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue them, and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese army in the suburbs of Yueyang, killing many Japanese soldiers. They are still in confrontation.

(Guangdong Area) The Japanese army in Xinhui and Jiangmen has been attacked by the Chinese army for days. The Japanese army resisted stubbornly, and the Chinese officers and soldiers bravely advanced. Mulang and Mashan, two strongholds near Jiangmen, were captured by the Chinese army. The Japanese army entrenched in Jinshan was subjected to a fierce counterattack by the Chinese army on the morning of the 11th. After a fierce battle, the remaining Japanese could not hold out and retreated to Jiangmen, leaving behind more than 700 corpses. The county seat was recaptured immediately, and they are continuing to pursue. In addition, the Japanese army that invaded Nanle was defeated in southern Hebei. Near Yishui in southern Shandong, more than 300 Japanese soldiers were killed. In northern Jiangsu, Gaoyou and Bao Ying were captured, and they are approaching Huai'an. In southern Jiangsu, Xiaxi (southwest of Changzhou) was captured. In western Zhejiang, they rushed into Hangzhou. In southern Hubei, Beigang was captured and Shaping was forced. In northern Hubei, they forced Suixian. The Chinese Air Force attacked Wuhan again on the 14th, destroying more than 100 Japanese aircraft, more than 30,000 boxes of ammunition, 50,000 gallons of gasoline, three fire trucks, and more than 40 vehicles, killing two Japanese air force majors, more than 60 pilots, and 300 army and navy officers and soldiers, and shooting down three Japanese pursuit aircraft. These are all the major war results of the week, and I am reporting them here as an addendum. (18th)

### American and Japanese Troops Withdraw from Gulangyu Simultaneously

Washington. US Secretary of State Hull announced that the Gulangyu issue has been resolved. This is a further symbol of the settlement of disputes between the US and Japan. The US and Japan have agreed to withdraw 42 marines each from the US and Japan Marine Corps in the Gulangyu Public Concession because the Municipal Council there is already working normally. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)

Washington. Naval officials here stated yesterday that they had not heard of the agreement on the simultaneous withdrawal of Japanese naval and US Marine Corps forces from Gulangyu. They stated that the matter was within the authority of Admiral Hurd, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, and that he had not yet reported the settlement of the dispute to the Navy Department authorities.

Washington.

### More Than Sixty Civil Servants Censured in the First Half of This Year; Most are Local Administrative Personnel; Police and Judicial Personnel are Second Most

Chongqing. Since the implementation of the Temporary Measures for the Exercise of Supervisory Power during Extraordinary Times, the Control Yuan believes that civil servants who violate their duties and commit malfeasance should be given urgent punishments and may submit written censures to the relevant responsible officials. This method is simple, quick, and very effective. In the first half of this year, for six months, inspectors and Control Committee members submitted more than 30 censure letters, and more than 60 people were censured. Among them, local administrative personnel were the most, followed by police and judicial personnel. The relevant competent authorities or their superiors have been able to give appropriate punishments to these censure cases. This method directly promotes the exercise of supervisory power and indirectly increases the work efficiency of civil servants, which is of great significance. (19th)

### He Yingqin Refutes Terauchi's False Claims

Chongqing. Terauchi Hisaichi is scheduled to return from Germany and Italy via New York today. He said that the Chinese army often deliberately approached foreign properties or used foreign properties as fortresses. Military Administration Minister He Yingqin pointed out his fallacies today. He said, "The Japanese policy is purely aimed at destroying the interests of third countries in China. Therefore, regardless of whether there is military value, they have resorted to indiscriminate bombing, arbitrary destruction, and plunder of foreign properties." Even now, foreign churches and other industries behind the Chinese battle lines are often subjected to indiscriminate bombing by Japanese aircraft. "All of this has been personally experienced and witnessed by foreigners, and it is by no means that the Japanese can cover up the eyes and ears of the world alone." For example, the Japanese army sank the American gunboat "Panay," shot former Ambassador Hugh Gibson with machine guns, and Japanese aircraft bombed the consulates of Great Britain, France, and Germany in Chongqing, as well as American churches, and drove out British and American missionaries from Shanxi, Henan, and other Japanese-occupied areas. "Are all of these because there are Chinese troops or Chinese defense works near their properties?" As for the actions of the Chinese army, they are entirely due to strategy. Approaching foreign industries has nothing to do with strategy. Any military scholar who knows a little about military affairs will be able to see that Terauchi's words are purely rumors, hoping to confuse the ears of Americans. (Associated Press, 19th)

### Dalai Lama Preparing for Enthronement

Another part of the delegation, led by Kong Qingqun (transliteration), Director of the Tibetan Affairs Department of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, departed in September, traveling through Sichuan and Xikang provinces, which should take two months to reach Lhasa. According to news from Lhasa, Tibet attaches great importance to the Central Government's delegation and is preparing grand welcoming events. It is noted that when the late General Huang Musong, the Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, went to Tibet, he also received a special and warm reception there.

### Japanese Communication Line Between Gaoyou and Yangzhou-Shaobo Severed; Jiangba, Yiche, and Lulujin Successively Recovered by Chinese Troops; Various Counties in Yuhua Subjected to Repeated Air Raids

Yuhua communication: On the 2nd of this month, the Japanese troops in the areas of Huaihe and Yangzhou-Shaobo simultaneously launched a joint land, sea, and air offensive. The Chinese troops in Gaoyou and other places mounted a fierce resistance, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. On the 3rd, Japanese forces again used many small warships and more than twenty speedboats to attack Xuyi and Jiangba. The Chinese troops also resisted once, but because the Japanese forces were very strong and bombarded with heavy artillery, the Chinese troops of the ×× unit were forced to shift their positions. Xuyi, Jiangba, and Licheng then fell successively. The Chinese troops of the ×× unit then readjusted their troops and equipped them with fresh troops of the ×× unit, and on the 7th launched a counter-offensive against the Japanese troops in Xuyi and Jiangba. Fierce fighting broke out. The Chinese troops charged bravely. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the assault. After several hours of stalemate, they were defeated that evening. Before leaving, they set fire to the houses of the people in Jiangba and killed many civilians. The Japanese troops in Xuyi were also forced to retreat in defeat. On the morning of the 8th, the Chinese troops of the ×× unit formally recovered Jiangba and Xuyi, and shot down a Japanese aircraft that crashed in Xuyi, catching fire in the air, and both the aircraft and the people were destroyed.

Yiche and Lulujin: After the Japanese troops occupied Gaoyou, they are now demolishing houses near the county seat to build fortresses. Many small warships, speedboats, and civilian ships are parked outside the West Gate. The Chinese troops are now closely monitoring the Japanese troops in Gaoyou, and at dawn on the 8th, launched a counter-offensive against Yiche and Lulujin south of Gaoyou. The fighting was fierce. There were not many Japanese troops at that time, and they were repeatedly attacked by the Chinese troops. The Japanese troops could not withstand the attack and retreated to Zhaoguanba in the afternoon of the 8th. The Chinese troops formally recovered the two strongholds of Yiche and Lulujin, cutting off the Japanese communication between Gaoyou and Yangzhou-Shaobo.

Fierce Battle in Baoying: After the county seat of Shiying was recovered by the Chinese troops of the ×× unit, the defensive works on the outskirts of the city were rearranged. However, because the Japanese troops were embarrassed when they were defeated, they suddenly sent many warships and speedboats from Gaoyou in the afternoon of the 8th to attack Baoying in retaliation. Taking advantage of the high water level of Lake Gaobao, their warships and speedboats were able to move easily. Therefore, when the Japanese troops arrived in Baoying, fierce fighting broke out with the Chinese troops defending the city. By about 7 p.m., the battle situation was very fierce. The Chinese troops bravely fought back, and the Japanese troops could not move at the West Gate, so they landed and harassed from the southeast. The two armies are still fighting fiercely in the eastern suburbs.

Funing area: On the morning of the 9th, at 8 a.m., the Japanese troops in Funing attacked the Chinese ×× position from Sujiazui, and were intercepted by the Chinese ×× defending troops. After a stalemate for three hours, the Chinese troops launched a flanking attack from both wings. The Japanese troops failed and fled to Funing.

Jieshou Recaptured: Jieshou, between Gaoyou and Baoying, was attacked by a Japanese vessel from Gaoyou on the morning of the 9th, carrying more than 100 Japanese soldiers to Jieshou, forcibly landing. The Japanese troops frequently came in contact with Chinese soldiers, and the Japanese attacked with artillery, and Jieshou was initially occupied. Chinese forces immediately counter-attacked in the afternoon, pressing forward wave after wave and drove back the Japanese army and recaptured Jieshou.

Victory at Caodian

The Japanese troops' attack on Caodian, Cuibao, and Taertoutou was repelled by the Chinese troops. According to those who have recently returned from the front lines, the victory of the Chinese troops was due to their bravery, and the strategic victory was also the greatest success. When the Japanese troops first attacked from Lianghuai, the Chinese troops withdrew to Liang. After the Japanese troops rushed to Anfeng Town, north of Shagou, the Chinese troops on both wings adopted an encirclement strategy to encircle and annihilate the Japanese troops. After arriving in Anfeng, the Japanese troops originally intended to take Shagou in one fell swoop, but fearing that their rear would be cut off, they fled back to Lianghuai in a panic.

Japanese Aircraft Rampage: On the 9th, Japanese aircraft in batches wantonly harassed northern Jiangsu, dropping bombs everywhere and destroying undefended towns and villages. According to the Yuhua air defense authorities, at 9:35 a.m. that morning, they received a phone call from Yancheng saying that two Japanese aircraft had been discovered in Sheyang, above the Yilin area. After reconnaissance, they flew north. At 10:00 a.m., they received a phone call from Dongtai saying that two Japanese aircraft had been discovered in Gangdun. After reconnaissance, they dropped seven or eight bombs and fled north. At 10:15 a.m., they received a phone call from Tai saying that the northwest had gone. At 2:20 p.m., they received a phone call from Dongtai saying that a Japanese aircraft had been discovered in Yancheng, passing through Shanggang Wuyou, and fleeing northwest. As for the bombed areas in Yuhua, one bomb was dropped on Kekeju, east of Sipailou, one bomb was dropped east of the county government, one bomb was dropped inside the court, one bomb was dropped in front of the county, one bomb was dropped in the rear of the county government, one bomb was dropped in the Shuixiang behind the county government, one bomb was dropped at Zhang Weiqing's house in Xiaoguandi Temple Alley, and one bomb each was dropped behind Tushan and behind the Zhaoyang Hotel (all fell into the water and did not explode). More than 100 houses were destroyed, and many civilians were killed and injured.

Also, when Japanese aircraft dropped bombs in Shagou Town on the 8th, before dropping the bombs, they first dropped several barrels of kerosene from the aircraft, followed by incendiary bombs, but fortunately they did not ignite.

### Guangdong Troops Recapture Zhongshan; More Than a Thousand Puppet Troops Die Almost Completely; Japanese Aircraft Bomb Rural Areas of Chaoan Wildly

Hong Kong Correspondence: The war situation in Guangdong Province has been quiet for many days. Since the Japanese army attacked Zhongshan, a more rapid wave has begun to occur again. However, the loss of Zhongshan can be said to be expected by the Chinese, and the Japanese have not seen any benefits from it. On the Double Tenth Day, Yuan Dai, commander of the first district guerilla troops of Guangdong Province, personally led his team in two directions to counterattack Shiqi. At that time, Chinese and Japanese troops engaged in fierce battles in the suburbs of Shiqi, and the artillery fire was extremely fierce. Although the Japanese army used aircraft to assist in the battle, constantly strafing in the Chinese army's position, the Chinese army fought with the Japanese and puppet forces without regard for personal safety, making it impossible for the Japanese aircraft to move. By the afternoon, the Japanese army felt that it could not support itself, so it set fire to the city of Shiqi, leaving only more than a thousand puppet troops trapped in the city walls, stubbornly resisting. They themselves quietly retreated. Thus, the Chinese army fought fiercely with the puppet troops all night. By the morning of the eleventh, the army had suffered heavy casualties, almost completely wiped out. By the afternoon, the Chinese army formally recovered Shiqi, and the Chinese guerrillas within Zhongshan County were fighting with the Japanese and puppet forces everywhere. The Japanese army's suffering this blow is enough to show that its strength is weak, reaching the extreme. Therefore, although the purpose of invading Zhongshan was to conceal its defeat in northern Hunan, the result was counterproductive, only depleting its strength.

As for the war situation in other aspects, it is still relatively quiet and there are no major battles. Before the Double Tenth Festival, the Japanese troops in Jiangdou and Huicheng claimed to attack Sanbu. The Chinese troops in Sanbu took the initiative and launched a two-pronged attack on Jiangmen. Fierce fighting broke out in the suburbs of Jiangmen. On National Day, they were still in a stalemate. In Dongguan and Baoan, the Chinese troops also dispatched troops on the Double Tenth Festival and attacked the Japanese strongholds along the Baoan and Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway again, and once again approached Shenzhen Nantou. The war was also quite fierce. In the Chaoshan area, the Japanese army was constantly attacked by the Chinese guerrillas, making them uneasy. Two days before the Double Tenth Festival, the Japanese army, fearing another severe blow from the Chinese army, sent aircraft to bomb the villages in the suburbs of Chaoan, so that dozens of villages were burned down, and three or four hundred farmers were killed and injured. The situation was unprecedentedly tragic. On the one hand, more than 130 boats of all sizes were searched for and arrested in the Han River in the suburbs and concentrated in two places, and set on fire. Men, women, old and young on the boats were all taken to Chaoan, and their lives and deaths were unknown. Their cruelty and viciousness were so great.

### The Japanese and Puppet Regime in Jiangyin Fantasize About Levying Land Taxes; Plan to Start Collecting From Inside and Outside the City

Jiangyin Communication: The puppet County Head Xiang Peixuan, all his words and actions, followed the wishes of the Japanese. Now, because of the puppet office’s shortage of funds, taking advantage of the new grain market, he fantasizes about collecting land taxes. On the afternoon of the 16th, the Japanese secret service agent, Terada, again instructed He to print grain passes and to cover the entire county's grain collection area. Most of it is in the hands of the Chinese army, and the entire compilation is completed and will take days. Therefore, it was decided to first collect from the city and surrounding areas and the nearby areas of Yuanyuan, Caijing, Xiacheng, Yuecheng, Huangqiao, Qiaoqi, Qingyang Sihe, and Beijiao and the nearby Changjing, Masi, and Jishan areas. Because the above areas, such as Caijing (i.e., Nanzha), Yuecheng (i.e., Yueqiao), Qiaoqi, Qingyang, and Beijiao, all have Japanese and puppet troops stationed there, they plan to go to the villages to collect taxes armed door to door. Other areas such as Huangtang, Yangku, Zhouzhuang, Huashi, Shazhou, and the Xishi areas, because they are controlled by the Chinese mobile teams, can only be discussed later, and the "Land Tax Office" has been established to accelerate the process. He Peixuan knows that this plan is difficult to achieve, but because he is urged by the Japanese, he has to do it hard.

### Overview of National Higher Education Guidance (II) - Youth Training Outline Promulgated by the Ministry After the War of Resistance

II. Promulgation of Guidance Standards

The guidance in schools above the junior college level in our country has never had a formal outline to follow, only slight hints in important laws and decrees related to education and in resolutions of the Central and National Conferences, such as the Law on National Education during the Period of Political Tutelage in the Republic of China, which stipulates that the Three Principles of the People are the fundamental principles of education in the Republic of China, and the purpose of education in the Republic of China is based on the Three Principles of the People, and the implementation guidelines mention that universities and specialized education must focus on practical science, enrich the content of subjects, cultivate specialized knowledge and skills, and truly cultivate sound character to serve the country and society. The Second Resolution of the National Assembly on Determining the Direction of Educational Implementation resolved that the guidance in schools at all levels must be based on the late Premier’s instructions to restore the national spirit, intensify implementation, and pay special attention to the cultivation of habits of hard work and strict discipline. The regulations on guidance in schools above the junior college level in the Principles of Implementing the Three Principles of the People are as follows:

(1) Should be based on the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen’s instructions to establish a revolutionary outlook on life based on the Three Principles of the People.

(2) Through strict training such as military education and competitive sports, to cultivate a strong physique and a spirit of perseverance.

(3) Strictly implement academic examinations and encourage creation to develop a spirit of thorough research.

(4) Cultivate an appreciation for nature and a respect for etiquette and music to cultivate a beautiful and robust personality.

(5) Should vigorously promote thrift and correct romantic habits to develop a simple and industrious life of commoners.

(9) Make all students participate in the late Premier’s memorial week and other revolutionary memorial days to enhance the spirit of loving the party and the country.

The Education Chapter of the Outline for Resistance War and National Reconstruction passed by the Provisional National Congress of the Kuomintang of China last year mentioned that education during the Resistance War and National Reconstruction should focus on the cultivation of national morality and the training of young people so that they can serve in the war zones and rural areas. At the same time, the Ministry of Education promulgated the Outline for Youth Training as a guideline for guidance. The key points of its regulations are as follows:

(1) Outlook on Life 1. Recognize that the purpose of life is to improve the life of the entire human race. 2. Recognize that the meaning of life is to create a continuous life for the universe.

(2) National Outlook 1. Recognize that the Chinese nation is one of the most excellent nations in the world. 2. Recognize that Chinese national world culture has its own unique contribution, which should be promoted. 3. Recognize that the Chinese nation should have a spirit of creation.

(3) National Outlook 1. Establish the belief that the country is higher than everything else. 2. Recognize the relationship between the individual and the country. 3. Recognize the current situation of our country and the path we should strive for in the future.

(4) World Outlook 1. Recognize the current situation of various countries in the world. 2. Recognize the nature of modern international society. 3. Recognize the relationship between our country and various countries in the world. 4. Recognize the position our country occupies in the international community and the mission it bears to the world. 5. Explain the significance of our country first restoring freedom, independence, and equality before we can promote world harmony.

The main items of training are: (1) Believe in the Three Principles of the People, (2) Believe in and obey the leader, (3) Develop the virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace, (4) Realize the meaning of the leader's advocacy of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, (5) Cultivate a spirit of fairness, honesty, simplicity, and integrity, (6) Forge a sound physique, (7) Train self-defense and national defense skills, (8) Militarize, productivize, and artistize life, (9) Recognize that the purpose of life is to serve, not to seize, (10) Recognize that serving society is a basic obligation of human survival, (11) Recognize that the essence of service lies in being able to help each other and eliminate selfishness, with social service as the premise.

In September of the same year, a circular was issued to all schools, using "Loyalty, Filial Piety, Benevolence, Love, Faith, Righteousness, and Peace" as the national motto, making plaques and hanging them in public places of each school, and promulgating twelve articles of the Youth Code:

(1) Loyalty and courage are the foundation of patriotism, (2) Seeking harmony is the foundation of managing the family, (3) Benevolence and love are the foundation of dealing with people, (4) Faith and righteousness are the foundation of establishing a career, (5) Peace is the foundation of dealing with the world, (6) Etiquette is the foundation of managing affairs, (7) Obedience is the foundation of responsibility, (8) Diligence and thrift are the foundation of service, (9) Cleanliness is the foundation of strengthening the body, (10) Helping others is the wood of happiness, (11) Learning is the foundation of helping the world, (12) Perseverance is the foundation of success. Each school should print and distribute it to students for them to read, recite, and understand and practice.

In short, the current guidance standards for schools above the junior college level are based on the purpose of education in the Republic of China and its implementation guidelines, in order to realize the Three Principles of the People as the highest principle of all training, so that all young people in the country have correct concepts and the determination to save the country, and follow the teachings of the sages, using "sincerity" as the central goal of training, and determining that loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace are the ethical concepts of each individual towards oneself, the family, society, the country, and the world. As for the guidance outline, it is still being drafted.

### Xiqing Basketball Encountering Problems: High Costs May Force Suspension; Participation Fee of $50 Required per Team

The current Xiqing basketball tournament was reportedly scheduled to begin in the middle of next month, but recent news indicates that changes are possible, and it is highly likely that the Xiqing Sports Department will convene a meeting next week to decide whether to proceed as planned or suspend the tournament. This is because all expenses this year, such as electricity and basketballs, have increased considerably. Spalding basketballs cost US$15 each, equivalent to over $100 in national currency, and even second-rate basketballs cost $70 to $80. If the tournament is held, the participation fee for each team must be at least $50. Whether the teams can afford this is a serious question. It is hoped that the tournament will not be suspended. If, in the worst case, the league is stopped, Xiqing plans to have the Xiqing, Paramount, and China United teams form a special competition.

### Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Road Construction Case: Negotiation for Resolution Possible; Reportedly, the Public Works Department Has Drafted a Plan for the Puppet Organization

The negotiations between the Public Works Department and the puppet municipal government regarding the issue of road construction beyond the Shanghai West Settlement have long been deadlocked and shelved. However, the puppet government's encroachments on rights concerning extra-settlement road construction are intensifying daily. The Public Works Department has reported this matter to the Consular Body headed by Wang Hai. The Consular Body will carefully study the Public Works Department's report with each Consul General of the nations involved in the Public Settlement before convening a Consular Body meeting for discussion. As of yesterday, the Consuls General had not yet gathered to exchange views.

Management Areas Will Be Divided

A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency, in an effort to understand the recent intentions of the settlement authorities, visited several individuals close to the Public Works Department yesterday. According to their accounts, the Public Works Department seems inclined to make some concessions regarding police and tax authority over the extra-settlement roads in western Shanghai to resolve this dispute. The extent of these concessions remains unknown. Generally, a plan has been drafted to divide the management authority of the area, allowing the puppet municipal government, under Japanese protection, to retain a portion of the authority it seeks to seize in the area.

Japanese Strategy Inconsistent

According to well-informed sources, the Japanese authorities have decided to send officials to guide the puppet municipal government to work with the settlement authorities to promptly and satisfactorily resolve this dispute based on mutual understanding. However, this behavior by the Japanese side reveals their double-dealing policy. Before the August 13th incident, when the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Public Works Department discussed the issue of road construction beyond the Shanghai West Settlement, the only foreign representative of the department who vehemently opposed making any concessions was the Japanese authority, which encouraged the Public Works Department to insist on its long-standing exercise of police and tax authority in the area. Now, it has completely reversed its previous position.

The Public Works Department Is Willing to Continue Discussions

The Shanghai Times reported that a reporter inquired with an official of the Public Works Department yesterday (the 18th) about whether the issue of residents in the extra-settlement road area paying taxes had been handled through the Public Works Department and submitted to the Consular Body. The official replied that the Public Works Department still hopes that residents in the extra-settlement road area will pay taxes to the department. Although the Consular Body is handling this matter, it has not completely gone through the Public Works Department and been submitted to the Consular Body. Currently, the department is not engaged in negotiations with the Shanghai Municipal Government. However, if the municipal government consults with the Public Works Department, the department will be willing to discuss and consider any issues raised. The official does not know when the Consular Body will convene, but believes the Consular Body has not yet decided on a date to convene to discuss the issue of taxation for residents in the extra-settlement roads and these areas. Furthermore, it was heard that these issues were not on the agenda for consideration at the Public Works Department's meeting last night.

Puppet Police Heavily Deployed, Situation Tense

Starting yesterday, there was a sudden increase in the number of puppet police stationed and guarding various roads in the extra-settlement road area in Shanghai West. At each location, there were as many as ten or more officers, or at least two or three, fully armed and stationed at key points. Additionally, at various intersections along the roads, such as the small roads along the main roads, and the intersections of Fahua Road East and West, numerous puppet police were also seen standing guard, paying close attention to pedestrians. The situation was tense, and the purpose was unclear.

Foreign Houses on East Zhuanbang Road Occupied

Residential foreign houses in the extra-settlement road area are sometimes occupied by the Japanese and puppet authorities without reason, disregarding the law. A reporter from the Daguang News Agency inquired with related parties yesterday and learned that a foreign house at a certain address on Dong Zhuanbang Road, near Yidingpan Road in Shanghai West, was forcibly occupied yesterday by a certain special agent organization of the puppet government. It is reported that the leader of the organization is a Mr. Dong. The interior is being arranged, but it has not yet officially opened. However, plainclothes guards are already heavily guarding the entrance, prohibiting pedestrians from approaching or peering inside.

A Small Squad of Chinese Troops Appears in Hangzhou; Japanese Police Station Targeted with Grenade; Japanese Military Exhibits Blatant Panic

According to the English-language North China Daily News, the Japanese military in Hangzhou is quite panicked because not only are there Chinese troops in the suburbs, but small units of Chinese troops have also appeared in the city. Several days ago, Chinese soldiers threw a grenade at a Japanese police station, causing several Japanese casualties. Incidents caused by the activity of Chinese troops have been frequently reported. In the past two weeks, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has been sabotaged and cut off multiple times by Chinese troops, forcing the Japanese to dispatch teams to repair it. Furthermore, according to the Japanese-controlled Zhonglian News Agency, it was admitted that guerrillas set fires in the suburbs of Hangzhou on the nights of the 14th and 15th. The Japanese military intelligence agency also issued a notice refuting the "rumors" to feign calm, proving that the situation in Hangzhou is indeed tense and that the Japanese are exhibiting blatant panic.

Since the departure of Soviet Consul General in Shanghai, Konstantin Nikolaevich, Vice-Consul Chipon, and Consular Secretary Korohaizev, et al., on a ship to Japan, no one has been present at the Soviet consulate building at No. 20 on the Bund. All affairs of the Soviet consulate in Shanghai have been entrusted to the Norwegian Consul General in Shanghai. It is learned that the Norwegian Consulate General has formally notified the Public Settlement's Public Works Department, stating that, according to the agreement between the Norwegian and Soviet Russian governments, the Soviet Russian consular affairs in Shanghai will be temporarily managed by Norwegian Consul General Nadson.

### Japanese Military Police and Detective Personnel Arrest People in the French Concession; Searches Conducted at Five Locations, Sixteen Arrested and Detained at the Police Station Awaiting Investigation

On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, several plainclothes personnel from the Japanese military police suddenly went to the French Concession Police Department and requested that officers be dispatched to jointly search the Dahu Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. As a result, one person was arrested. Based on the arrested person's confession, at 2:30 AM yesterday morning, they, together with French Concession police officers, searched No. 18 Remi Lane on Remi Road, No. 7, Alley 313 on Route Gustave de Plaine, the Mountain Apartment, and No. 9, Ronghua Lane on Route Maran. The Police Department dispatched Chinese and Western officers to accompany them. After searching the three locations, they arrested four women and eight men residing there. The operation concluded at 5:00 AM. Because no evidence was found at the three locations, the Police Department temporarily detained the individuals. At 5:30 PM, the Japanese side dispatched personnel again to accompany Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession Police Department to No. 263 Avenue Albert, where they arrested two women and one man, seizing two Mauser pistols, one handgun, over a hundred rounds of ammunition, and brought them to the Police Department for investigation.

### Buddhist Master Yuanying Arrested During Lecture by Japanese; Yuanying is a Disciple of Taixu and President of the Buddhist Association; Another Monk Arrested Simultaneously, Reason Unknown

At 12:30 PM yesterday, six or seven plainclothes Japanese personnel, accompanied by a Chinese translator, arrived in a vehicle with license plate number 5437 at the entrance of the preaching hall established by Master Yuanying, President of the Chinese Buddhist General Association, located at No. 443 Daxilu Yidingpan Road, on the border of the Public Settlement, with Public Settlement address D-50. The Japanese from the vehicle immediately entered the hall together and forcibly took Master Yuanying, who was lecturing, and another monk to the outside. The Japanese side had dispatched another vehicle, license plate number 5014, which

Followed Behind

The Japanese personnel pushed Yuanying and the others into that vehicle and sped away. Afterwards, the Jing'an Temple Police Station of the Public Settlement received the news and immediately dispatched detectives to investigate. This incident has attracted much attention. According to reports, Master Yuanying is from a county in Zhejiang Province and is over fifty years old. Last year, he went abroad to

Promote Buddhism

After returning to Shanghai, he resided at the Facang Temple at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Route Kleber in the French Concession because the Yuanding Temple, a branch temple of the Yuantong Temple on Zhoujiazui Road, where he previously resided, was far away after the August 13th incident. He was originally a disciple of Master Taixu. The reason for his arrest is unknown.

Japanese Forces Organizing Boundary Markers in the Jia District North of the Suzhou Creek; British Forces Reinforce Wire Mesh, Forming a Confrontational Stance

Regarding the situation in the Jia District north of the Suzhou Creek, according to a reporter from Datong News Agency who continued to inspect the area yesterday morning, the boundary markers previously set up by the Japanese side at the intersections of various side streets along North Henan Road, which were hastily placed on the walls of shops or on telephone poles, have now been deemed unsightly and inconspicuous. Recently, next to the previously placed boundary markers, tall iron poles of approximately ten feet in height have been erected, and boundary markers have been newly nailed to them. Consequently, numerous boundary markers are densely arranged along the side streets east of North Henan Road, indicating a meticulous approach. After workers wearing yellow armbands with the words "Construction Department of Rental Properties" removed the sandbags from the empty house at No. 5018 Lao Bazi Road, where a discarded hand grenade was found the day before yesterday afternoon, the sandbags piled inside the house were also completely cleared away by these workers.

Furthermore, concerning the barbed wire and obstacles along the boundary road, as the defense zone between the British and Japanese armies has changed, the British army is obligated to reorganize the boundary obstacles under its control. Yesterday, numerous British soldiers were seen reinforcing damaged barbed wire and wooden obstacles along the boundary road. At the two gaps on North Jiangxi Road, the Japanese army deploys several guard dogs every night after 8:00 PM, when traffic is prohibited. If an unfamiliar person approaches these two gaps, the guard dogs bark fiercely and may even bite the person.

According to a key official of the company, repairs are expected to be completed by tomorrow morning (the 21st). The losses from this theft amount to thousands of dollars, and telephone users in the Hongqiao Road area are experiencing significant inconvenience as a result.

The request has been approved, retroactively increasing the allowance from 20% to 40% of their monthly salary, starting from August. For Chinese employees whose original salary is $200 or less, the monthly rice subsidy has been increased from $1 to $5.

### Philippine Vice President Departs Shanghai for the Philippines This Morning; Issued Statements to Western Newspaper Reporters Before Departure, Saying the Philippine Islands Follow U.S. Foreign Policy

He Himself Is Very Fond of Shanghai

According to the English-language North China Daily News, Philippine Vice President Osmeña, who arrived in Shanghai from the United States on Sunday morning and stayed for several days, set sail for Manila on the Victoria at 10:00 AM today (the 19th) with his secretary, Bonaseda. This morning, before Vice President Osmeña's departure, reporters visited him at the International Hotel and inquired about the Philippines' attitude towards the current

European Conflict

Vice President Osmeña replied that the Philippine Islands will follow whatever foreign policy the U.S. government pursues. He also stated that he enjoyed his four days in Shanghai very much. He had visited Shanghai several times before and has found that despite the various difficulties China has faced in recent years, Shanghai has still made

Good Progress

He himself is also among those who love Shanghai and feels that Shanghai will definitely become more prosperous and important in the future. As for the situation in the Philippines, from an economic point of view, it is developing "very rapidly," and there has also been significant development in administration and education. Regarding

Philippine Independence in 1946

Vice President Osmeña reiterated what he had said to reporters before, stating that as the final permission has been approved by the U.S. Congress, there will be no further changes. U.S. Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Hart met with Vice President Osmeña yesterday afternoon (the 18th) and had a pleasant conversation for about half an hour.

Refugees Awaiting Relief After Eviction; Crying of No Recourse, Sleeping in the Wilderness, Severely Hit by Wind and Rain the Night Before Last

The 31st refugee shelter of the Cilian Branch, located at No. 11 Rue Cardinal Mercier in the extra-settlement road area, has been uneasy since the Japanese and puppet military police invaded and occupied a portion of its premises on the 9th of last month. Although the actions of the Japanese and puppet authorities have been unreasonable, the refugees have "respected them from afar" and tried their best to accommodate them in everything, so the order has been

Relatively Peaceful

Unexpectedly, at around 2:00 PM on the 17th, the Japanese and puppet authorities suddenly evicted the over six hundred refugees from the shelter. Apart from a portion that voluntarily dispersed, the rest were driven out. At the time, there was no one in charge at the shelter, and the sponsoring charity did not address the matter. The refugees cried out without recourse and had no choice but to move to the outdoor

Open Space to Sleep

The night before last, they were severely hit by strong winds and torrential rain. The general refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, with their cries of hunger and cold, were almost unbearable to witness. It is heard that the Japanese and puppet authorities are now planning to expand their various organizations and intend to first relocate the

Puppet Police Substation

located in the dormitory of the China Bank employees on Rue Cardinal Mercier, to the shelter. Upon investigation, the China Bank dormitory currently houses the headquarters of the Japanese military police, the Japanese Pacification Team, the Puppet Social Affairs Bureau Office, the Puppet Finance Bureau Office, and the Puppet Police Substation. Because the premises house numerous agencies, and the buildings are insufficient, it was decided to move the Puppet Police Substation into the shelter, resulting in this misfortune for the refugees.

The Cheng Haitao Case; Criminal Arrested; Cheng's Remains to Be Placed in Coffin Today

After Mr. Cheng Haitao, secretary translator and acting Chinese superintendent of the political department of the French Concession Police Department, was murdered on Rue Conty the day before yesterday morning, the French Concession Police Department strictly ordered all subordinates to arrest the murderer.

It is also heard that the arrested criminals have confessed to participating in other criminal cases and are currently undergoing thorough investigation by the police department. Furthermore, Cheng's remains are scheduled to be placed in a coffin at 3:00 PM this afternoon, the 20th of this month, at the Shanghai Funeral Home on Xujiahui Road, after which the funeral procession will depart. The coffin will be temporarily stored at the funeral home and transported back to his hometown for burial at a later date.

### Clearance Procedures for Goods from Germany, Czechia and Austria Via Haiphong; Three Million Yuan Belonging to Shanghai Chinese Merchants; Registration Deadline Extended to the End of This Month

Due to the Sino-Japanese War, native goods from Shanghai transported to southwestern and northwestern China are now loaded in Shanghai and shipped directly to Haiphong, then transported to Kunming via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and further inland. As a result, American firms Butterfield & Swire and Jardine Matheson have both launched direct shipping routes from Shanghai to Haiphong to focus on cargo transportation. Merchants from Yunnan, Sichuan, and other provinces have dispatched personnel to Shanghai to establish representative offices to procure various goods for transport and sale. Before the outbreak of the European war, the value of goods from Germany, Czechia and Austria transported to Haiphong awaiting transshipment inland and belonging to over one hundred and fifty Shanghai forwarding companies, firms, and factories, was estimated at thirty million yuan in national currency, but all belonged to Chinese merchants.

Extending the Deadline for Visa Processing

After Wu and Chen from the Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce arrived in Shanghai, they immediately met with French Consul General in Shanghai, Baudizzio, and explained the situation, stating that the goods from Germany, Czechia and Austria awaiting transshipment to inland China were all owned by legitimate Chinese merchants and should not be treated as enemy goods, requesting leniency to avoid damaging the capital of Chinese merchants. The French Consul General agreed to be lenient and negotiated a method for handling visa procedures at the French consulate in Shanghai for purchasing goods in Shanghai. The deadline for registering German, Czech, and Austrian goods was extended to October 31. However, all merchants must expedite the request for a visa from the French consulate with evidence that the goods from Germany, Czechia and Austria awaiting transport in Haiphong were paid for before September 3 of this year.

Visa Procedures at the French Consulate

The visa procedures at the French consulate are as follows: For goods from Germany, Austria, and Czechia belonging to Chinese merchants that arrived in Haiphong before September 3 of this year, evidence that the goods were paid for in full, such as purchase invoices, payment receipts, and accounting books, must be submitted along with the "Temporary Visa Certificate" originally issued by the French consulate in Haiphong to request a visa from the French consulate in Shanghai. If the "Temporary Visa Certificate" is not in Shanghai, a copy of the "Temporary Visa Certificate" can be used as a substitute. If a copy is also not in Shanghai, other methods will be used to facilitate the process. Cargo owners with any questions should inquire at the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road or the Zhonghe Express Company on Jiangxi Road.

Continuing to Request Extension of Registration Period

According to Wu Bomin, a specialist from the Haiphong Chinese Chamber of Commerce, the method for the French consulate to issue visas for the release of goods from Germany, Czechia and Austria belonging to Chinese merchants in Haiphong has been negotiated with the French Consul General in Shanghai. Goods transported from Shanghai to Haiphong will be handled by the French consulate in Shanghai, while goods transported from Hong Kong to Haiphong will be handled in Hong Kong. Although the Haiphong Chamber of Commerce has agreed to extend the registration deadline to the end of this month, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has decided to request another extension because, in reality, it will be difficult to complete the process before the end of this month. He (Wu, referring to himself) and Mr. Chen Shanzhi plan to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong and then Haiphong after the visa procedures have been negotiated.

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Promotes Sino-Swiss Trade; High Foreign Exchange Rates During the European War Present Opportunities to Promote Trade

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that China and Switzerland have a long-standing and friendly relationship, and Switzerland, as a permanently neutral country, can maintain this friendship. Given the current period of the European war, coupled with high foreign exchange rates, promoting domestic goods to Switzerland is a unique opportunity. At the same time, Swiss goods, such as machinery, watches, etc., are well-manufactured and can replace products from other countries. It is proposed to take advantage of this opportunity to promote Sino-Swiss trade relations. Various industries, businesses, and import/export trading houses interested in conducting this trade can submit their list of required goods to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce at No. 59 Hong Kong Road at any time.

The Tobacco Exchange Industry Hoards Fractional Currency; "Exchange Rate According to the Market"

After the Central Bank issued fractional currency notes, they still have not become widely circulated in the market. As a result, fractional coupons from companies such as the tramway, public buses, Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun are still accepted and used in the market. As the tramway company's three-cent coupons are about to be discontinued, and the substitutes for fractional currency will decrease, the problem of small change will inevitably become more difficult. The tobacco exchange shops clearly still have the intention of hoarding fractional currency during exchanges. They do not display the exchange rate and instead write "Exchange Rate According to the Market" on the exchange sign. The intent is very clear. It is hoped that the industry association will persuade them to stop this practice.

### New Fourth Army Controls the Nanjing-Suzhou-Jiaxing Region; Engages in Several Clashes with the Japanese Army, Inflicting Heavy Casualties; Japanese Soldiers Were Also Killed and Wounded in the Battle of Fengjing

According to the China Press, a Japanese army spokesman stated yesterday (the 18th) that the newly formed 30th Division of the Chinese New Fourth Army has recently been engaging in activities such as sabotaging railway tracks behind Japanese lines and clashing with the Japanese army in the triangle region connecting Nanjing, Suzhou, and Jiaxing, resulting in casualties on both sides. Two Japanese soldiers were killed and six were lightly wounded in the battle of Fengjing.

Shandong Guild Hall Raises Relief Funds for Disaster in Jiaodong

The counties in Jiaodong have millions of residents, most of whom rely on farming for a living. Unfortunately, due to poor rainfall this summer, a severe drought has occurred. All the crops have withered. In August, violent rain and storms occurred one after another, not only making harvest hopeless but also sweeping away nearly all the straw huts. It is also heard that Penglai County has suffered a hailstorm, which has caused even greater damage than other places. During this time of war, it is difficult to import food from outside the province, and in remote areas, even grass roots and tree bark will be eaten to the point of exhaustion. With the imminent arrival of winter, the starving people who are about to freeze are a great cause for concern. It is heard that the Shandong Guild Hall in this city has issued a call for donations for relief and is currently in the process of doing so. It is hoped that the various public organizations and charitable individuals in the city will enthusiastically provide assistance.

Post Office Revises Standard Envelopes

The Shanghai Postal Administration has revised the following points for domestic and international mail: Standard envelopes are divided into two types, A and B. Previously, each type of envelope had a stamp of five or two cents, respectively. Those who purchased these envelopes did not need to affix additional stamps and could write their messages on the second fold of the envelope. Now, the standard envelopes have been changed, with only a stamp design printed in the upper left corner of the envelope, indicating where the appropriate amount of postage should be affixed. Those who purchase these envelopes must purchase the required postage stamps and affix them to the stamp design in the upper left corner. Type A envelopes are sold for five cents per ten, and Type B envelopes are sold for four cents per ten. When sending letters abroad, the recipient's name, address, and the sender's name and address on the envelope should be written in the language of the destination country. If only Chinese is written, a Romanized translation must be attached to avoid omissions and difficulties in delivery in the destination country.

### The Long Chang Strike Has Lasted Five Months; Resumption of Work is Hopeless; The Factory and Workers Could Resolve Differences, but Behind-the-Scenes Instigators Are Doing Their Best to Sabotage

According to the Continental News, a senior official of the British-owned Long Chang Company told reporters yesterday (the 18th) that the strike at the company's Pootung factory has lasted five months, and negotiations to resolve the strike remain deadlocked. Although company personnel have repeatedly tried to bring the dispute to an end, they are certain that the factory will not resume work anytime soon. The factory shutdown has caused great hardship for three thousand workers, and the majority of the workers who went on strike are still unemployed. It is reported that the strike has also caused huge losses to the company.

Long Chang Cloth

As one of the most reputable brands in the area, Long Chang cloth will disappear from the market this winter. In the opinion of company personnel, if the company and the workers could negotiate separately, differences could be resolved. However, "saboteurs" are obstructing the negotiations, leading to a deadlock. One of the demands made by the so-called workers' representatives to the company after the meeting in July was to pay the workers

500,000 Yuan

for "expenses incurred during the strike." The company considered this demand to be "ridiculous" and rejected it. Another demand from the workers was a 12% wage increase. The company had actually agreed to this demand, as the plan proposed by the company to the workers would have resulted in a 19% monthly wage increase. In early May, some workers at the Long Chang Textile Factory demanded a wage increase, leading to the strike. On June 10,

Factory Official

Ding Gele was killed by Japanese military police, leading to a general strike. Long Chang Company's printing and dyeing factory was established in 1927 and is equipped with new equipment. In 1934, the Long Chang Textile Factory was established, equipped with 44,000 spindles and 1,130 looms, capable of producing 680,000 yards of cloth per week. The striking workers include 2,300 from the textile factory and 700 from the printing and dyeing factory. The textile factory employs mostly female workers, while the printing and dyeing factory employs mostly male workers.

### Today's Weather Forecast: Strong Winds Expected

The weather in this city has been quite volatile recently, with unpredictable sunshine and rain, as well as drastic temperature changes. Yesterday, due to a high-pressure system moving south from the north, there was a light drizzle around 9 AM, which lasted for about half an hour. Although the weather cleared up in the afternoon, the temperature dropped sharply, with a low of only 62.8 degrees and a high of only 71.8 degrees.

Wind Forecast

Yesterday, the Yangtze River basin, including Nanjing and Hankou, experienced halos and clouds, making it difficult for the weather in this city to return to normal. Furthermore, with the southward movement of the high-pressure system, strong winds are expected today, possibly reaching force three or four. Based on this prediction, it is likely that the weather will become increasingly cool.

Tomorrow's Tides

The high tide in the Huangpu River has receded below two English feet since today, so recovery is expected. However, tomorrow around 1 PM, exceptionally low roads such as the corner of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, the corner of Alabaster Road and Gansu Road, and Jessfield Road and other locations may still experience tidal flooding.

### British Community Groups Unite to Form Central War Fund, Aiming to Collect Donations from All British Residents in Shanghai and Unify Support for British Soldiers' Needs; Sir Victor Sassoon Donates One Million Dollars

According to the "North China Daily News," the various important British community groups in this city held a meeting on the 16th of this month in the office of the British Consul-General, Mr. Phillips. Under the chairmanship of Mr. Phillips, the Shanghai British Central War Fund was established, aiming to unite the fundraising efforts of all British residents in Shanghai and provide comfort to British soldiers. The fund will have a general committee, chaired by Mr. Phillips, which will soon determine the policy for implementing the fund's objectives. The administrative aspect will be handled by an executive committee, chaired by the British Consul, Mr. Kitson. The fund will soon appeal for whole-number and monthly donations, and will also issue special appeals from time to time. Subcommittees to handle various aspects of the fund's activities will also be established. The funds raised will be allocated according to the needs of various places in Britain caring for British soldiers. The committee is aware that the current situation in Shanghai, due to trade disruptions and unfavorable market conditions, cannot be compared to the situation during the last Great War. However, it firmly believes that the British residents will do their best to fulfill their collective duty to those who defend the country. The office of the Shanghai British Central War Fund is located at 27 The Bund.

Another report states that the British community in Shanghai, in order to donate funds to support the war effort in their homeland, formed the Shanghai British War Fund Central Fundraising Association on the 16th, bringing together sixteen British community groups. The association officially announced yesterday afternoon that Sir Victor Sassoon has signed to donate one million dollars, to be paid in twelve monthly installments, making it the largest donation since the association's establishment.

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association has paid close attention to the resettlement of refugees. In addition to providing job referrals and production work, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, the secretary-general of the association, has announced the repatriation cases handled by the association from its establishment to the end of September of this year. A total of 285 refugees were directly repatriated, and 2,933.40 yuan in resettlement funds were issued. Additionally, 16 tickets were issued for Haiphong, 41 tickets for Hong Kong, 4 tickets for Tianjin, 1 ticket for Fuzhou, 1 ticket for Qingdao, 1 ticket for Xingang, and 14 tickets for Ningbo. The indirect assistance provided to various charitable organizations for repatriation is not included in these figures. According to the association's procedures, each refugee can request assistance ranging from 2 to 15 yuan. Those who need tickets can also request free tickets from the International Repatriation Committee and various shipping companies through the association. Recently, the various shelters of the Joint Relief Committee of Shanghai Charitable Organizations for War Zone Refugees are planning to close down and send away a large number of refugees, and all expenses are also requested to be subsidized by the association. The first batch requires more than 8,000 yuan in repatriation fees, and the Tzu Lien Hui is currently sending personnel to negotiate a proper solution with the association, aiming for a pragmatic approach and ensuring that funds are not wasted. However, due to the large number of people, the various procedures required by the association take time, so the date for issuing resettlement funds has not yet been determined.

### Murder of Father An: Five Suspects Arrested; Mastermind Zhou Yuelou Still at Large

In the case of Father An, who was murdered on August 30th of this year in Xujiahui, after the perpetrator Ju Bolu surrendered himself, the French Concession police have successively arrested the suspects Shen Xingtang (44 years old, local), Xu Gendi, also known as Jinxiang (28 years old, local, previously imprisoned for over a year), Jiang Yongqing (nickname Amu Lin, 24 years old, from Minhang), and Wang Guirong (41 years old, from Shandong, residing at No. 7 Puyi Lane, Gordon Road). Because the case still requires investigation and the mastermind Zhou Yuelou is still at large, the arrested suspects were transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday for further investigation. Judge Liao presided over the interrogation. According to the defendant Ju Bolu's confession, in the autumn of last year, Xu Gendi mentioned the idea of attacking Father An, but it was abandoned. This spring, Xu introduced Amu Lin to the defendant as a friend, and later they met Zhou Yuelou and Shen Xingtang. A week before the incident, Xu Gendi, Zhou Yuelou, Amu Lin, and others discussed the matter again. On August 29th, Zhou Yuelou found a pistol and went with the defendant to Father An's place. The next day, Zhou invited the defendant to Father An's room, first closing the door, then knocking Father An down and tying him up with hemp rope. They took the keys and watch from Father An's side, but failed to open the iron safe, only managing to steal Russian banknotes, Japanese banknotes, and Hong Kong tickets worth about 1,800 yuan before escaping. As for how Father An died, the defendant claimed to be unaware. The defendant only received 30 yuan. Later, thinking that his property was all in Xujiahui and he could not escape, he surrendered himself. According to Jiang Yongqing, also known as Amu Lin, he participated in the planning of the robbery of Father An. On the day of the incident, he only acted as a lookout and received 70 cents. According to Xu Gendi, he once planned it last autumn but did not implement it. This time, it was planned with Ju Bolu, Zhou Yuelou, Shen Xingtang, and Amu Lin. However, the actual robbery of Father An was carried out by Zhou Yuelou and Ju Bolu, with Amu Lin and Zhou Yuelou's uncle acting as lookouts outside the door. Afterwards, they gave the defendant 15 yuan. Shen Xingtang and Wang Guirong both vehemently denied any involvement in the case. Wang Guirong's defense lawyer, Yu Zhaolin, presented his opinion to the court, stating that Wang Guirong was not involved in the case and requested bail. The judge then ordered that the defendants be detained and rescheduled the hearing for November 2nd.

### Infant Unable to Breastfeed Due to Illegal Surgery: Infant Dies, Old Woman Arrested and Prosecuted

Pan Shi, a 53-year-old woman from Haimen, recently sought refuge in Shanghai due to the war and was staying at the No. 6 Refugee Shelter on Yanping Road. Wang Wenbo, a fellow villager in the shelter, had a two-month-old infant named Didi who suddenly fell ill and was unable to breastfeed. Pan Shi said that the child had "mantis larvae" in his mouth and that she could cure him. Wang Wenbo then gave her half a yuan. On the 17th around 1:30 PM, Pan Shi used a small knife to make incisions on both cheeks of the child's mouth, claiming to be cutting out the "mantis larvae." After a while, the child's condition worsened, with no improvement, and he was dying. The next day at 5 PM, the child's father, Wang Wenbo, hired a car to take him to the Tongren Hospital, but the child died just as they arrived at the hospital entrance. The doctor examined the child's mouth and found deep knife marks on both cheeks. This type of surgery was considered illegal, and the Gordon Road police station was notified. Officers rushed to the refugee shelter on Yanping Road, arrested Pan Shi, and took her along with a handbag containing medicine powder, a small knife, and other items to the police station for detention. The child's body was sent to the Jiaozhou Road autopsy center for examination. Yesterday morning, the police transferred Pan Shi to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, explained the case, prosecuting her for the crime of causing death by negligence and requesting a postponement. The evidence, including the small knife and medicine bottle, was presented for examination. The defendant's testimony was evasive, and she begged for leniency. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered her to remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing.

### Claiming to Have Real Estate for Sale: Gang Conspires to Defraud Large Sums of Money; Zou Shiying Sues After Being Defrauded

Xu Maodi, a local resident living in a flat behind No. 447 West Rue Pottier in the French Concession, Shen Shangda, residing at No. 156 Rue Henri, and Qiu Shundao, residing at No. 9 Rue Pottier, were recently sued in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court by Zou Shiying, a resident of Wuxi at No. 68 Hengmao Lane, Route Miktcheff, who hired lawyer Ge Zhitan to file a complaint for the crimes of colluding to defraud property and issuing bad checks.

Summary of the Complaint

The complaint stated that the first defendant, Xu Maodi, was introduced to the plaintiff by the second defendant, Shen Shangda, and the third defendant, Qiu Shundao. Xu Maodi claimed that he owned a piece of land measuring 1.7 li in the Shenjia Wooden Bridge area of West Rue Pottier in the French Concession and intended to sell it for 7,700 yuan. Because the plaintiff wanted to purchase the land, he expressed his willingness to buy it. On August 16th of this year, with Shen Shangda and Qiu Shundao as witnesses, he paid Xu Maodi a deposit of 1,000 yuan in national currency, agreeing that Xu Maodi would clear the buildings on the land within a month, and then the land price would be paid in full, and a formal real estate contract would be signed. On the 27th of that month, Xu Maodi and Shen Shangda came to the plaintiff's home and requested an advance payment of 700 yuan for the land, and wrote an IOU stating that it would be deducted from the land price in the future. On September 5th, Shen Shangda again led Xu Maodi to the plaintiff to take away 400 yuan. On the 13th of the same month, Shen Shangda and Xu Maodi came to the plaintiff's home and brought a paper with the name of Yang Haigen, showing the location of 7.9 li of land in the South Shanghai District, requesting a mortgage of 1,000 yuan to the plaintiff. The plaintiff believed it to be true and paid 1,000 yuan. On the 17th of the same month, Xu Maodi and Xu Shangda came to the plaintiff's place, using the excuse that the land purchased by the plaintiff had previously been mortgaged for 1,000 yuan, needing 1,000 yuan to handle the procedures, which could be used as the land price later, so the plaintiff's uncle代垫 another 1,000 yuan in national currency. The plaintiff, because the defendants repeatedly used excuses to withdraw money, was deeply afraid that there was fraud in it, so he investigated in all directions and discovered that the defendant Xu Maodi had no real estate and that the paper with the name of Yang Haigen previously delivered to the plaintiff was also forged. Only then did he know that Xu Maodi and Shen Shangda had colluded to defraud money. He wanted to report to the police for investigation, but the third defendant Qiu Shundao came forward to request a peaceful resolution, promising to return the previously defrauded land price of 4,100 yuan. The check given to the plaintiff by Qiu was also a bouncing check, showing that the defendants Xu Maodi, Shen Shangda, and Qiu Shundao colluded to defraud money, so he had no choice but to file a criminal lawsuit. According to the complaint, Judge Zhu Chuzhe of the First Criminal Court summoned the case yesterday. The defendants entrusted lawyers to appear in court and requested an out-of-court settlement. The court briefly questioned both parties and ordered that the case be rescheduled for October 26th for further hearing.

### Tailor Suddenly Promoted to Prominent Position, Abuses Power and Extorts: Deceives Superiors and Exploits Local People; Evil Deeds Come to a Head and He is Executed by Firing Squad

Ma Yigen, from Pudong, was a Western-style tailor (commonly known as a Red Gang tailor) in his thirties. He had gone to Japan to make a living, still working in his profession, so he learned some Japanese. Due to business failure, he bought a boat and returned to China. In Pudong, he was destitute and sold vegetables for a living. At the end of the year before last, the Japanese army landed in Pudong, and the people had all moved away. Only Ma lingered and continued to sell vegetables. He was captured by the advance search team of the Japanese army. Ma took the opportunity to tell his story in Japanese. The Japanese army was short of people to communicate with, and seeing that Ma knew Japanese, they appointed him as an interpreter. Thus, he soared to prominence and suddenly became arrogant and self-important. Although the Japanese army repeatedly decided to transfer him, Ma remained in his post, currently serving as an interpreter for the detachment of the 42nd Company of the Naval Special Landing Forces. He used the convenience of his position to deceive his superiors and oppress the common people, extorting money indiscriminately, accumulating assets of up to 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. A poor boy had become a rich man. Recently, he was accused of several major crimes to the Japanese Navy's 4th Task Force, which detained him for investigation. The evidence was conclusive, and he was sent to the Yangjiazhai Military Police Department the day before yesterday. He was executed by firing squad that evening, and his body was ordered to be collected.

### Hotel Landlady Hides Money in Quilt: Discovered by Illicit Lovers; Divide the Spoils and Flee, Arrested for Violating Curfew; Unexpectedly Encounter Victim in Police Station, Evidence and Culprits Found Together

Wang Ji, the landlady of the Wuxi Hotel at No. 506 Hankou Road, recently had 7,000 yuan in legal tender deposited by her relative, Sun Changfa. In order to avoid attracting the attention of criminals, she hid the 7,000 yuan in a quilt. Last night around 12 o'clock, Ni Guangda, a tailor from Ningbo, and Wang Shunxing, accompanied by Wang Caizhu (19 years old) and Wang Caifeng (23 years old), female teahouse waitresses from the Sinshih Amusement Park, went to Room 33 of the hotel for a rendezvous. However, there was only one quilt in the room, which was difficult for the four of them to share, so they ordered tea servant Wang Er to add another quilt. Wang then gave Ni and the others a quilt in which the landlady had hidden 2,000 yuan in legal tender. After Ni and the others obtained the quilt, just as they were about to embark on their sweet dreams, they suddenly felt something bulging in the quilt. Upon opening it, they found a full 2,000 yuan in legal tender. Ni and the others were overjoyed at the unexpected wealth. As a result, after distributing the 2,000 yuan together, they left the hotel around 1 o'clock. However, the curfew had already passed, and they were stopped by patrol officers just a few steps out the door and taken to the Zhabei Police Station. At this time, Wang Ji had also discovered the loss of the money and immediately went to the Zhabei Police Station to report it. Unexpectedly, she encountered Ni and the others in the questioning room of the police station. Wang immediately told the story. Under investigation by Chinese detectives Shan Zhaoxian and Sun Dafa, 600 yuan were found on Ni's person, 500 yuan on Wang's person, 414 yuan on Wang Caizhu's person, and 200 yuan on Wang Caifeng's person, totaling 1,714 yuan in stolen goods. The whereabouts of the remaining 286 yuan were unknown. Yesterday morning, Ni and the others were transferred to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi prosecuted them for the crime of theft, requesting permission to reschedule the hearing because the unrecovered stolen money still needed to be investigated. Under interrogation by Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Court, he ordered that the hearing be rescheduled.

### Opening Savings Deposit Slips on Behalf of Others: Defrauding Money and Attempting to Escape, Arrested: Thieves are Full of Surprises

Recently, in various banks, there are often people impersonating bank employees, using the excuse of writing deposit opening slips on behalf of others to take the opportunity to defraud others of their property. Yesterday afternoon at 1:50 PM, Yu Agen (also known as Changgen), the owner of the Xinglong Restaurant at No. 46 Huaji Road, took 500 yuan in legal tender to the Fourth Bank Savings Association at No. 261 Hankou Road to open an account. Yu could not write the opening slip himself. At that time, a person named Li Qingyun from Zhenjiang claimed to be an employee of the bank and was willing to write it on his behalf and deposit the money. Yu did not doubt him and handed the money over to Li. After Li counted the money, he tried to take the opportunity to escape. However, Yu suddenly had a stroke of good luck and asked people whether Li was a bank employee. He then realized Li's fraudulent behavior and reported it to the bank. The bank recovered the 500 yuan and sent it to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian requested permission to detain Li, stating that there had been many similar incidents, so a detailed investigation was necessary. Under questioning by Judge Dai Rongjun, he ordered that he be remanded in custody and the hearing be rescheduled.

### Finance Speculation Turns to the Stock Market, Gold Market Dull and Lifeless

Yesterday's spot gold dark market saw fluctuations of only five yuan, a level of calmness rarely seen since the outbreak of the European war. The reason for this should be attributed to the shrinking scope of operations. Small speculators find no opportunities to profit, as the foreign exchange market has been rock-solid, and the public bond market has been strong due to the smooth progress of the war in China, with people's hearts firm and prices rising steadily, making it difficult to monopolize. Trying to reverse this trend would surely lead to failure. However, it is recently rumored that many speculators have already begun to stir towards the stock market. Therefore, the recent volume of stock transactions has been the highest in the past, which is undeniable. As for the spot gold trading situation of the day, a certain gold firm showed considerable eagerness to supply. The overall situation seemed to be that buyers were taking advantage of the opportunity to scoop up gold, and supply from sellers had no impact. Therefore, the closing price was 4,009 yuan, only one yuan lower than the previous day. The total trading volume for the day was light, about 700 taels. Gold ornaments at silver shops remained stagnant, and customs gold prices also remained unchanged.

Spot Gold Drops Slightly by One Yuan

From the morning, the initial market situation for each bar (ten taels) was calm, with currency dealers trading 20 taels with each other at a price of 4,010 yuan. After the opening, news of a stable and firm foreign exchange market slightly dampened the buying interest. Furthermore, currency dealers and silver shop assistants came forward to sell, immediately pushing the price down by four yuan. Currency dealers then traded another 10 taels at 4,006 yuan. Later, due to a sudden absorption by securities firms, the market stabilized. Securities firms bought 30 taels from a certain gold firm at 4,010 yuan. At that time, the selling interest of that gold firm was still strong, selling short several hundred taels. Although Hong Kong firms entrusted a certain silver shop to buy over 200 taels, other buyers showed little appetite, and the situation eventually weakened slightly. Soon, the price dropped by five yuan. A certain gold firm sold 20 taels to a certain silver shop at 4,005 yuan. Afterwards, news of a slight recovery in the foreign exchange market greatly increased the appetite of retail investors. In addition, another gold firm also bought on behalf of customers, so the situation returned to stability. A gold firm bought 30 taels from currency dealers at 4,010 yuan, setting the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the market became even quieter. Initially, the foreign exchange market was slightly firm, and the opening price was up by two yuan. A gold firm sold 10 taels to currency dealers at 4,008 yuan. Later, securities firms absorbed dozens of taels, and the price quickly rebounded by two yuan. Securities firms bought 20 taels from currency dealers at 4,010 yuan. Finally, at 3:07 PM, a gold firm sold 10 taels to currency dealers at 4,009 yuan, setting the evening closing price. As a result, the price was down by one yuan compared to the previous day. It was heard that after the close, a certain gold firm still wanted to sell at the evening closing price, but a certain currency dealer only offered 4,007 yuan, so a deal was difficult to reach. The entire day saw fluctuations of only five yuan. The selling price of spot gold from cash firms was ten yuan higher than spot gold, while the buying price had to be reduced by about thirty yuan. Currently, the spot gold auction price is more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold price, and deals are rare.

The Buying Price of Gold Ornaments Rises Slightly

The exchange price of gold jewelry from silver shops remained stagnant. Da Tong Hang still offered 405 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang offered the same price. The buying price had to be reduced by fifteen yuan or so.

Foreign Exchange Market

Lacks Attention

A Reversal of the Previous Tense Situation

Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed prices remaining stable. The situation in the British and American exchange markets remained quiet. Not only were the fluctuations very small, but there was also a sense of less attention, a stark contrast to the tense situation of several months ago. The day's activity sufficient to enliven the market was the continued selling by Hong Kong firms, with HSBC continuing to absorb. However, there was no sign of excess inventory. Buying and selling created a rigid market price. The strongest price during the day for British currency was only 4 shillings 6.25 pence, and for US currency, it was 7.71875 yuan. Until the evening closing, the continuous natural easing of prices continued, and the price continued to firm. British currency was 4 shillings 6.09375 pence, down 0.03125 from the previous day, and US currency was 7.6875 yuan, also up 0.0625. According to the listed price, the combined British and American exchange rate was 4.0027 yuan. As for futures trading, no one wanted to trade, and the situation was even more quiet. Trading volume for the day was scarce.

Hong Kong Firms Sell Slightly

The morning opened with the recent London large bar shrinking by 0.125 and the distant date falling by 0.25. The New York silver price was unchanged, and the London bullion price remained stagnant. The exchange rates of British currency against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat, and the US currency was also flat against British currency, down slightly by 0.05 against Shanghai currency, and up slightly by 0.01 against French currency. The central government's listed prices for various currencies remained unchanged. The bank and agricultural bank's spot selling prices were 4 shillings 5.78125 pence for British currency and 7.625 yuan for US currency, compared to 7.625 yuan for US currency in a certain bank's current month. The market situation was quiet and unchanged. When HSBC's listed prices were announced and remained unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced and down by 0.075, a sudden telegram from Hong Kong arrived, selling HSBC spot British currency at 4 shillings 5.9375 pence and 6.09375 pence. Following this, a Hong Kong telegram also sold spot US currency at 7.65625 yuan and 7.6875 yuan to a certain bank and other foreign firms, so the process was slightly firmer. Afterwards, the selling trend subsided slightly, and the situation softened slightly at one point, with British currency at 4 shillings 5.9375 pence and US currency at 7.65625 yuan. At noon, a Hong Kong telegram came again, selling HSBC spot British currency at 4 shillings 6.09375 pence, so the situation was still difficult to escape the easing trend. Extending to the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 4 shillings 6.09375 pence for British currency and 7.6875 yuan for US currency, slightly down 0.03125 for British currency and slightly up 0.0625 for US currency compared to the morning opening.

Both Spot and Futures Prices Show Easing

The state of the aftermarket remained very calm. Initially, the Hong Kong telegram continued to sell, and the price was slightly firmer. It was calculated that the Hong Kong telegram sold HSBC spot British currency at 4 shillings 6.093751 and 6.25, and sold spot US currency at 7.6875 yuan and 7.71875 yuan to the US bank. Later, foreign firms were also willing to supply at the above prices, but the closing prices were 4 shillings 6.09375 pence and 7.6875 yuan. The current month was the same as the above price. The November British currency was 4 shillings 5.46875 pence, and the US currency was 7.5625 yuan, slightly down 0.03125 for both British currency and slightly up 0.0625 for US currency compared to the previous day.

No Change in the Hong Kong Exchange Market

### Securities Foreign Stocks Active, Domestic Bonds Rise Slightly

The dark market for unified public bonds was particularly chaotic, with large investors increasingly taking a wait-and-see attitude, and the fluctuations becoming smaller. After the sharp rise in bond prices in the past week, the strength of both the bulls and bears was evenly matched, and they have been in a stalemate for many days. Although the bulls have tried to push up the prices several times in the middle, the bears have forcefully sold at high prices, and the buying sentiment has weakened. Therefore, in terms of trends, if good news can follow, there is a possibility of continued rise. However, because the price has reached a peak, it is difficult to withstand intense shocks. If unfavorable stimuli are encountered, the reaction will also be considerable. In the market process yesterday, the opening in the morning was caused by the scarcity of buyers, with only Jiu Feng showing more interest in buying, while Heng Kang and retail investors successively supplied, making the market atmosphere exhausted and unable to do anything, and falling by a certain amount. Although Hong Kang Lianyi No. 64 and others sold off in the afternoon, Runli and Da Feng forcefully bought Type C, and Yong Kang also took in a lot of stock. Therefore, the market atmosphere became firm and rebounded by a certain amount. The turnover was lackluster, about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan.

Unified E | 47.85 | 47.45 | 47.85 | Rose 0.15

Stock Market Situation: 65 shares of the Shanghai Stock Exchange were traded at a price of 40 yuan.

Yesterday's stock market at the Public Industry Exchange: In the afternoon, the new account for a week was launched again, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense. The buying sentiment was exuberant. In the first half hour, the trend was fierce and confusing. The turnover was extremely large. Both buyers and sellers on the price list were full of active atmosphere.

London, 18th dispatch: The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt today remain calm, and there are no changes in the prices of bonds at all levels.

Also, 18th dispatch: Today's listed prices of stocks of various British companies in the Far East: The British-registered shares of HSBC Bank rose by one pound to 75 pounds, and the shares of Gula Keling rubber rose by eight pence to 16 shillings and 3 pence, the rest were flat.

### Silk and Tea Rising Again and Again, Silk Prices Unprecedented, Sharp Rise in Japanese Silk, I Fear This is Not a Good Omen

The rising trend in the foreign silk market seems to have entered a feverish state. New York's Japanese silk at 83 cents rose by 0.25 cents, which can be called unprecedented. White filature at 75 cents rose by 0.22 cents, Shanghai silk rose by 0.19 cents, the near-term rose by 0.04 cents, and the far-term rose by 0.005 cents. Yokohama's spot price was 1,800 yuan, and the far-term price was 1,791 yuan, up 80 yuan. The Shanghai market situation yesterday was warm and firm. White filature passed 4,400 yuan, but no transactions were made yesterday because manufacturers unanimously expected prices to rise. Inside the crepe de chine the recent sales are still active and has not been sold at the best market price. Therefore, yesterday silk merchants held prices leap, creating a firm market and clear transactions.

Furthermore, foreign silk prices have soared, and the transaction volume of Yokohama spot goods exceeded 1,100 packages for the two days before yesterday and the day before yesterday, and the futures transaction volume reached as high as 19,605 dan. From this point of view, in addition to the impact of European peace being hopeless and the smooth transition of New York silk sales, the rise in silk prices this time must also consider the factors that Japan's silk production this year has followed all production cuts and tightened, and that the Japanese yen is gradually approaching adversity in foreign exchange. Therefore, the sharp rise in silk prices this time should include the above points.

### Yarn and Cotton Shashi Is Unbearable to Look Back on, Guest Merchants Withdraw from the Market, Relying Only on Transactions between Colleagues

The yarn market continued to weaken, and the falling trend became more and more severe. 20-count Double Horse broke the 700-yuan mark, which is actually due to the stagnation of guest sales and the daily increase in spot chips. At the same time, a certain Feng sells as much Double Horse spot goods as possible in the market every day, slightly dipping into the warehouse receipt and maintaining the market. However, the overall pull is too large, and the sales are mostly sold out, and people's hearts are even more hit. As for those with sufficient financial resources, they are still quiet and do not show any signs, and ordinary floating households, in view of the poor environment and weak strength, can only endure the pain of cutting off the connection. Therefore, although the daily atmosphere is very lively, the results are all transactions bought and sold among colleagues. Guest merchants have already withdrawn from the market.

The opening situation of the spot yarn market this morning is still not good, and many people are watching from the sidelines. The opening price fell by 10 yuan, breaking the mark. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse is 690 yuan, but 10 bales were traded among colleagues. No one asked about the warehouse receipt. After a while, due to the strong selling trend, it fell by another 5-6 yuan. The current spot price of the ticket is only 680 yuan, but actual transactions still do not come. Then a certain Ji yarn store slightly took in a few bales and raised it by 5-6 yuan. According to the statistics of the half-day transaction, 1,110 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 12 yuan, Tian Nu fell by 18 yuan, Double Globe fell by 8 yuan, and Shepherd fell by 15 yuan. The amount of purchases made by each gang is listed on the left,

### Yarn Prices Fall, Cotton Sales Greatly Reduce

Cotton trading is still in a weak way, because the falling trend of the yarn market is strong and there is no way out, and the market is still declining. As a result, the factory has no intention of offsetting the raw materials, so business has been greatly reduced. At the same time, there is no obstacle to the source, and people's hearts are particularly stable. However, there is a slight need in Qingdao. 5,327 bales of Tongzhou cotton arrived at the pier. Today, 450 pieces of cotton machine cotton are transported to Tianjin. The current sales situation of cotton is listed on the left.

Roller Brazil | 186.00 | | 200 Pieces Among Colleagues

Another message: Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai have recently been more relaxed, and yarn prices have fallen due to sluggish sales, so the prices have fallen. The cotton market is quite sluggish due to the influence of yarn prices. The factory has a large stock of inventory, and the appetite is very weak. No transactions have been heard, and it has been open for more than a month. Colleagues are quite interested in buying American cotton, but this is all a transaction of intention. Yesterday, in the spot trading, only the Qingdao Gang bought 100 bales of Brazilian cotton at a price of 186 yuan.

Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was quite firm in the morning, and colleagues and speculators bought it. After that, the transaction was suddenly quiet, and the bulls who settled the deal were active, so the market fell. The recent price fell by 12 pounds, and the far-term price was quite outstanding, and it rose by 5-6 pounds. India fell by three rupees including the forecast, and the Egyptian cotton market rose by 5-6 pounds yesterday. Liverpool rose by two pence.

### Grain New Rice Rises Again

Since the new rice and Ning species Baige suddenly soared once they were scarce the day before yesterday, yesterday only two or three thousand packages of new goods of various colors were transported by car, continuing the good side. Moreover, once the general guests encounter trendy goods, they will not retreat due to the expensive price, and they will search for each other, competing to be the first, and the price will rise step by step. High prices have been repeatedly quoted, resulting in a rise of another one yuan compared to the previous one at the close. If Chang Bang new rice opens at 31.5 yuan, Kunshan Taicang high-quality goods also open at 30 yuan and 29 yuan, only Tangshi old broken new rice only opens at 25.5 yuan, while Suzhou Tong Bang new rice is not available. Qingjiao Ningzhong opens at 31.5 yuan, Fengjia Dashou Baige opens at 30 yuan, and Zhongguan goods also open at 29 yuan. In short, it cannot escape the situation where scarce goods are expensive. As for Luyangjian in the early morning, the stores on this street also inquired a lot, so the general retailers followed the new rice market and shouted high prices. Finally, due to the relatively abundant arrival and storage, it was not easy to get attention, and the closing price was similar to the previous one, with little gain or loss. The broken rice and Chen new yuan are both declining orders and clearing files, so the sales of both are not extensive, and the market goods are uniquely weak, and the price is stable. After the origin of each customer's tip has been interrupted, the market has been uniquely popular for a while. Yesterday, at the beginning of the opening, the go-away road in the local village was still quite active, and the opening price continued to show an outstanding show. And suddenly a certain Japanese foreign firm launched a large number of Wujian stored in the Hongkou District, which is said to be more than 3,000 packages, taking advantage of the opportunity. Then the market goods suddenly became oversupplied, and people's hearts were immediately depleted. In addition, the market changes have been drastic recently, and it is common to see the number of yuan rise and fall. At this time, purchasers are all wary, and suddenly they all present a wait-and-see attitude, and the transaction returns to stagnation. Then the guests' homes are eager to let go, and they have to shake the price to invite each other. As a result, the market has risen to fall. Although the surface is about half a yuan lower than the previous market, the actual drop is one yuan when calculated by comparing the tight and weak before and after. According to statistics, the city-wide turnover is only five or six thousand packages.

Wheat Source Obstructed Again

Transfer Station Flour Increases by One Corner Compared to Factory Price

Flour Yesterday's spot flour transaction was seen to be free and easy, and the guest gang's going away was more greedy than before. The Jin and Hong Kong importations were all active, but the factory has recently blocked the source of wheat, and the price of wheat has risen. The amount is limited, and it can only supply a small number of zero-batch transactions on this street. And at the moment, the floating deposit is exhausted, and the seller is even more holding up, and the transfer station goods of the car and boat brand are all increased by one corner to corner half compared to the factory price. The transaction is only more than 10,000 packages. It is heard that foreign flour is lacking in both storage and arrival, and the price of the Bat brand is shouted at 8 yuan, and the price of the Japanese factory Phoenix brand is 6 yuan 9.23 yuan.

Wheat The sources of goods from all over the country are often obstructed today, and the arrival of goods has been reduced repeatedly. The cargo side takes advantage of this to live in a rare place, and they are all in a state of not being able to escape without rising prices, so it is difficult for the factory to absorb as much as possible, and the hoarding households rarely pull in. The Tongshi was handled by Fufeng and Liangchang to Jiangbei Mai 1,600 packages, and the price was 10 yuan 1.8 cents to 9 yuan 9 cents. The hoarding households bought two cars of Daqiao Mai, and the price was 10 yuan 5 cents.

### Sugar Market Coarse Car White Rising Trend Greatly Burning

The sugar market yesterday was very strong due to the Dutch telegram, and the crude white production price has reached Dutch shield 14.00, a good start of 1.70 more. Therefore, the association's planning and market atmosphere are even better. The spot 24 crude white local station rose by 3.5 yuan to 61 yuan, the outer station was 62.5 yuan, 62 yuan, 61.8 yuan, rose by 3.5 yuan to 2.8 yuan, the transshipment cargo was 50 yuan to 50.5 yuan, a total increase of 3.7 yuan. Taikoo Car White rose by 34 yuan, B Mark was 66 yuan to 65 yuan, CW Mark was 64.5 yuan, CX Mark was 64 yuan, DY Mark was 62 yuan, HX Mark was 61.5 yuan, H Mark Car Red rose by 2.5 yuan, to 445 yuan, Dutch Red rose by 2 yuan, to 45 yuan to 45.5 yuan, Benmian White rose by 3.5 yuan, Zhenji No. 1 was 62.5 yuan, and the rest was returned. Benbing rose by 4 yuan, No. 1 was 74 yuan, Jingmingbing was 75.5 yuan, and according to Hong Kong power, Taikoo B Mark factory plate must be Hong Kong currency 20.00, an increase of 4.00 from before. Guotang also brought it well, and 200 packages of Shangbing white were opened, at 58 yuan, an increase of 4 yuan. Chongdi Qingjiao 40 yuan, the line still bid, out of line has not been completed, and 170 packages of sugar were transported from Beihai yesterday.

### Oil Market Soybean Oil Falls Back by One Yuan

Yesterday's soybean oil market, in the early morning, one was because the tank oil arrived and was connected, and the other was because the go-away road was waiting to see, and the buying and selling were holding back. At noon, a part of the floating storage was eager to get out of the cage. Kobe oil first shouted a drop of one yuan, and other oils also followed suit and fell by six or seven corners. In the afternoon, the actual sales volume slightly inquired, and the falling wind was stopped. The market was immediately set. 40 barrels of Kobe oil were traded at a price of 68.5 yuan, 50 barrels of Qingdao oil were traded at 67.5 yuan, 800 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at 49.3 yuan, 200 pieces of Yanqui oil were traded at 50.3 yuan, 300 pieces of Qingqi oil were traded at 49.8 yuan, 250 cans of Tianjin canned oil were traded at 65 yuan. Peanut oil slightly fell by 5 corners, 350 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded at 58 yuan.

### Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Hoarders Constantly Returning

In the national cloth and white goods market, the lower-end 9-pound and 11-pound Yongbang and this street are still healthy, and the agricultural market has turned firm for a while, but in the afternoon, the hoarders are constantly closing out, and the actual needs of each household are also holding a wait-and-see attitude. The small amount of hand goods in the evening market is full, and the market is weak again. Yihong rough cloth rose by one corner in the morning, and fell back by one corner to one and a half corners in the afternoon. The market is chaotic and has lost its standard. It must be based on the amount of goods in the same industry. Yihong 13-pound rough cloth was originally 1 yuan 2.5 corners lower than 14-pound, and 2 yuan higher than 11-pound. Now, because the amount of 13-pound goods is uniquely small, the selling price is 3.4 corners lower than 14-pound, and 4.5 yuan higher than 11-pound. Therefore, the selling price of 13-pound goods in the future will be much worse than the rest of the gears. The price of fine cloth and fine twill is particularly loose and abuse. The local street hoarding households and wholesale colleagues handled 200 pieces of rough cloth, 100 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill, and a part of the hand goods of bleached and dyed printed cloth are sold at low prices, and the overall maintenance is still the original disc. Foreign sales are more prosperous, and Mumbai, Little Luzon, and Thailand continue to handle printed satin, line and color cloth, and silt cloth for more than 5,000 pieces. The Yunnan Gang handles color cloth, line and color cloth, etc. for more than 2,000 pieces. The Guangdong Gang has been quite strong in searching for goods such as Longchang freight bars, serge, and straight tribute satin. Yesterday, the continued transaction of velvet Longchang freight for more than 3,000 pieces.

Due to the lack of actual sales, the selling price of Dongbi continues to fall. The current selling price of Longtou fine cloth is 20 yuan per piece, Wufu is 18 yuan 7.5 corners, Longtou fine twill is 18 yuan 7.5 corners, Yanghe is 19 yuan 2.5 corners, and each continues to fall by 2.5 corners per piece. The stack of goods of the Four Gentlemen Serge in the morning market fell to 6.375 corners per yard, and the direct tribute was 6.55 corners to 6 points, and the market was very weak.

### Market Overview

Discount Falls Again by One Yuan Yesterday's exchange of discounted notes, the current cash is still oversupplied, each 1,000 yuan was around 56 yuan in the morning, and slightly dropped to 55.5 yuan in the afternoon, and then pressed down by one yuan, and the money industry association's lending rate, the morning and afternoon markets are still open at 1.7 corners and have not been changed.

Very Few Changes in Foreign Currency Yesterday's foreign currency market has become more and more stagnant, only the US dollar bill has slightly fallen by 5 points, and the Japanese gold bill has returned by 2%, and the Korean bill has also been good for 5%, and the rest have not moved.

The Great Horse Mouth Iron Turns Machine The 26th Great Horse Mouth Iron has been silent for a long time in the market, and the market suddenly saw its birth yesterday, because the 24th cargo was out of stock, and the price rose to 1,000 yuan, and they changed to handle 26th cargo, so the market gradually became active, and the market also saw a slight rise. Yesterday, in addition to the yarn factories and sales factories on this street as major buyers, the Jin, Yan, Qing, and other guest gangs also searched for dozens of boxes, selling at 500 yuan per box, but there were also those who threw out 478 yuan.

### The Cause of Tragedy Between Husband and Wife

... Young couples who grow old together, why must mandarin ducks be separated?

The most tragic thing in the world is discord between husband and wife. Many couples either love to the point of resentment, or never had true love to begin with, or love but cannot harmonize, turning affection into hatred. It is certainly regrettable to meet with enemies, but enemies can be avoided, whereas husband and wife see each other day and night, a thorn in the eye constantly stimulating the nerves. How painful is this!

In principle, mutual attraction between men and women, and love between husband and wife, is human nature. How can a pair of healthy and beautiful young couples not be deeply in love? In a harmonious married life, they are truly happy like immortals, bearing sons and raising daughters, a perfect family, what happiness in life! Even in old age, when both have white hair, their children have grown up and become independent. Everything, everything, is created by them together. On the journey of life, they feel that husband and wife are the most intimate companions, and there is so much comfort in their hearts! As the saying goes, "Young couples who grow old together," the value of husband and wife lies in this. So why must tragedies occur between husband and wife? According to medical analysis, the majority of the causes are that men in their early years have committed masturbation and nocturnal emission, or early marriage and excessive indulgence, or late marriage and excessive lewdness, depleting the germinal fluid that governs sexual health. Consequently, various symptoms such as neurasthenia, brain weakness and kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation and impotence, incomplete development, and premature aging arise. Such men not only have the pain of being unable to cope with family burdens, but also are bound to be weak and incompetent in the sexual life that is the foundation of marriage, or even unable to perform sexually, turning good things into bad things. How can this not arouse the wife's hatred? Hatred accumulates over time, and if it is not eliminated, once it erupts, a catastrophe is inevitable. Therefore, there must be a fundamental cause for the tragedies of elopement, suicide, quarrels, and divorce between husband and wife.

Love must be built on a foundation of healthy sexual function, which no one can deny. If a healthy and beautiful woman marries a weak and sickly man, I'm afraid everyone would feel it inappropriate! Therefore, a man should not be a husband unless he is already one; if he wants to be a husband, he must be healthy and energetic, and then he can talk about love and enjoy the happiness of beauty. If one is unfortunate enough to suffer from the above symptoms, one should seek treatment as soon as possible, and never be negligent, lest one harm oneself and others! According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking the male tonic animal gonad extract "Sheng Zhi Su" is the most effective treatment for this condition, as this agent is the world's number one supplement for sexual dysfunction, and it is particularly effective in nourishing the brain. After taking it, it can generate sperm, invigorate the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, and nourish the nerves in one day and night. Regular use can also promote development and adjust metabolism, and it will definitely cure various symptoms in a short period of time, making the body healthier. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" to strengthen the sperm gate and prevent leakage, so that the effect will be faster!

Patient Mr. Lu Xiaofeng suffered from severe brain weakness and kidney deficiency. He had been married for a year, and to put it jokingly, his wife was probably still a virgin, so their relationship was icy. Recently, his weakness had worsened, and he also had nocturnal emission. He took all kinds of tonics on the market, but they were all ineffective. He came to me for diagnosis and treatment. After carefully examining his symptoms, I immediately instructed him to purchase half a dozen "Sheng Zhi Su" and three boxes of "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company, and take them together. The nocturnal emission was cured first, and after a few months, he suddenly felt energetic, his complexion was rosy, he did not tire from work, his love for his wife increased, and I heard that there were signs of a dream bear!

### Leaving Nocturnal Emission Untreated Will Bring Misfortune to Your Life

Sex disease specialist Nian Hui

This cannot but be attributed to the lack of sex education. Nowadays, young people suffering from nocturnal emission are almost everywhere. Why is there nocturnal emission? The most common causes are reading lewd books and paintings, or watching lewd dramas and movies, or associating with lewd young people and listening to obscene words. Young people are curious, which arouses motivation and lewd thoughts. When desire burns fiercely, if they do not achieve their goals, they commit masturbation and lewd fantasy. One must know that masturbation and lewd fantasy are improper sexual behaviors that easily damage sexual nerves, causing the sperm gate to loosen, and nocturnal emission will then follow. In addition, early marriage and excessive indulgence, late marriage and excessive lewdness, postpartum imbalance, and congenital weakness can all cause nocturnal emission, but they are relatively rare.

Nocturnal emission initially often occurs due to sensual stimulation in dreams. If it is not treated, the symptoms will worsen. Even during the day, slight sexual stimulation will cause seminal fluid to be emitted, or seminal fluid will leak out due to slight labor or bowel movements. This is the most serious stage of nocturnal emission. Seminal fluid is the source of our life. If we allow it to leak out without treatment, it will inevitably lead to sperm depletion and blood exhaustion, resulting in various symptoms such as brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, kidney atrophy, premature ejaculation, incomplete development, and premature aging. As a result, the face becomes yellow and the muscles become thin, energy is exhausted, progress cannot be made in studies, the job cannot be done, and when one wants to fall in love, one is always abandoned by girls. Even if one marries a woman through matchmaker's words, married life will not be happy, and life will fall into a miserable situation! To seek remedy, one can only quickly take the special medicine for treating nocturnal emission "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" to strengthen the sperm gate and calm the nerves, so that nocturnal emission can be cured. Those who already have the above symptoms must also take the gonad extract "Sheng Zhi Su" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, and regular use will definitely cure various symptoms in a short period of time, making the body healthier. "The right medicine is like unlocking a lock." This is the effective treatment method recognized by famous doctors at home and abroad and my many years of experience. Patients with nocturnal emission should quickly extricate themselves!

### Ladies with Shrivelled Breasts, Please Don't Worry and Grieve! American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei

Lively children, healthy and beautiful mother, relatives and friends all praise, not only is it a great glory for oneself, but the husband's reputation is also glorious.

"A wise wife brings no misfortune to her husband," this old saying is indeed very meaningful. Just imagine, in today's society, if there is a healthy and beautiful wife at home, with a gentle temperament, a slender figure, and handles household chores in an orderly manner. She is even more gentle and considerate to her husband. If there are also one or two children around, lively and clever, skipping and frolicking, the family is shrouded in joy, and the god of happiness is constantly circling with them. Then, will this husband still go out and wander around, causing trouble? Therefore, men who can marry a healthy, beautiful, and virtuous woman are indeed blessed by three lifetimes of cultivation. Because a woman can be called "healthy and beautiful," the first thing she must have is well-developed secondary sexual characteristics. With well-developed secondary sexual characteristics, the breasts are high and erect, the buttocks are plump, and the figure is flexible. The posture already has a very moving curve, giving men a very good feeling. As for the inner aspects, due to the strength of her own ovarian function, the metabolism is orderly. Naturally, the blood is abundant, the muscles are smooth, the temperament is gentle, and the mind is agile. Such women can not only be good wives and mothers in the family, respected by relatives and friends, and loved by husbands, but also be sophisticated in external affairs, winning praise from everyone. Their happiness will be boundless! However, in the past, if one has committed masturbation, chest binding, irregular menstruation, unclear leucorrhea, or malnutrition, resulting in the destruction of ovarian function, the breasts will not develop well. Even if the breasts had good development to begin with, they will gradually shrivel, until they are as flat as a man's. How can such women not be disgusted by men and abandoned by society? To seek remedy, one can only actively take the ovarian endocrine preparation for women "Sheng Zhi Su", which is the most effective treatment. This agent has been introduced by famous doctors in China and the West and is praised as the only special medicine for treating women's hidden diseases and underdeveloped secondary sexual characteristics. The ingredients are noble, the preparation is excellent, and after taking half a dozen continuously, the shriveled breasts will be raised high and erect, and the rosy cheeks will increase health and beauty.

Spring and Autumn

### A Small Suggestion

This small suggestion may not only be the author's personal "ideal", but everyone else, like the author, does not dare to say it. Because many residents are "closed off", the second floor is isolated from the third floor, and the front building does not interact with the back building. Once they "cooperate", everyone feels inconvenienced—or rather, everyone loses out. But please look further ahead and try hiring a servant together and burning a stove together. Isn't it more cost-effective than each doing their own thing? (Editor)

Before the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, when I saw the cramped households in a single building, I had an "ideal" and suggested it to my landlady and co-tenants, but unfortunately, I was rejected by everyone. Even now, a single building is even more cramped than before the war. Seeing this situation, my past "ideal" always comes back to my mind from time to time. I have tried several times to suggest my "ideal" to my new landlady and co-tenants, but I always don't dare to say it. But I feel that my "ideal" is not "harmful" to everyone, but "beneficial" to everyone. I might as well use a corner of "Spring and Autumn" to make a preliminary suggestion to all the compatriots in Shanghai who are overwhelmed by the burden of life. I wonder how everyone feels?

Before the war, my "ideal" was this:—

I feel that in a single building, there are three or four households (or more) who each do their own thing, needing to light three or four coal stoves. Each "housewife", that is, the so-called "housewife", is busy all day long with cooking, drinking, and other miscellaneous chores such as washing clothes, which is really distressing to watch. Therefore, I feel that in this building, regardless of the boundary between the landlady and the tenants, the rent should be shared according to the size of the rooms (this may not be possible at present, because before the war, outside the central area, landlords filling empty rooms was very common, hence this "ideal"), and one or two servants should be hired together to specialize in cooking and washing clothes. Of course, here, each family contributes a certain amount of money for food and dishes according to the number of people. In this way, each "housewife" can free up time, or can carefully educate their children, and at the same time, they can also receive some elementary education. If they have a job, that would be even better. As for whether hiring servants is uneconomical, then each or two households can take turns doing it every month. This not only frees up time to do the work of educating oneself, but at the same time, and more importantly, it can save a lot of expenses.

Now, due to the different situation, my "ideal" can of course have some modifications:—

First, the boundary between the landlady and the tenants cannot be disregarded, I think it is impossible to do.

Second, taking a step back, it is also impossible to use the entire building as a unit.

However, if we divide it according to "floors", and cooperate in cooking and eating by "ground floor", "second floor", and "third floor" (laundry is not necessary), I think this minimum is always possible, right! Often in the corridors of the "front building" and "back building", and at the doorways of the pavilion rooms, there are three coal stoves. Why not combine these three stoves into one, which can save a certain amount of expensive coal price, and at the same time avoid the danger of fire (the news of fires published in the newspaper is mostly because the residents in a building are crowded, and the fire is caused by "too many" coal stoves)? Why can't this be implemented? I hope that the middle and lower classes of compatriots in Shanghai will carefully consider the situation and make some reforms according to their own circumstances. This will not only reduce the burden on their own lives, but also cultivate a cooperative and eliminate selfish mentality. Of course, it is also of great significance for the current arduous endurance and the pursuit of the country's final victory. (Unknown)

### Worthy of Attention: The World of Flower Demons Floating Clouds

Editor:

The special area of ​​western Shanghai, with its smoky dens and gambling dens, has long been well known. In addition to the opium dens and gambling dens, which dare not be blatant in the public concession, the flower association's gambling has spread from western Shanghai to the concession, especially the area north of the Suzhou River. If residents living in the area pay attention to each other in the neighborhood, especially the female relatives, it can be said that six out of ten families like to play flower associations. Because most of the families living in the Hebei area are workers' families. The men go to work early in the morning, and the women are at home with nothing to do. When they encounter a door that looks like a refugee camp, with a dozen or even twenty households living in it (Note: The houses along the road are city houses, and the houses in the alley have at least ten households in each hundred of the courtyard doors. As for one door living in twenty-seven or eight households, as far as the author knows, there are already more than a dozen doors like this on North Zhejiang Road alone.), it is difficult for the masses to live, and most women love money. Moreover, most of them have not received education, and besides the husband's wages to maintain the family, they only know how to spend money and cannot earn a single penny. Therefore, the flower association, which does not require much effort and can exchange ten copper coins for one yuan in legal tender, has become a common delusion in their minds. Wouldn't it be unjust to send the money earned by the husband's blood and sweat to this trap for nothing?

In addition to this group of women who are obsessed with money, the majority are men who are unemployed and idlers who do not want to find work and make a living all day long, but only want to win copper coins without any effort. So, they get up early in the morning and ask Zhang and Li, what did you dream last night? Guessing dreams and making bets, borrowing, and pawning, until they lose everything, even to the point of committing suicide, what a pity!

It is said that there are more than a dozen listening tubes directly connected to the Caojiadu big tube on several roads in Hebei. Under these dozen listening tubes, there are one or two hundred "sailing ships". Each listening tube has a collection of five or six hundred thousand per tube. There are three tubes in Hebei every day, which has nearly ten thousand collections. What do hundreds of people who live by this do every day? People who are fascinated and not awakened, I hope you wake up from your dreams early and stop fantasizing. I also hope that the local authorities will pay attention!

### A Visit to the Automobile Driving and Repair Training Class Mu Xu

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, in view of the importance of production education for refugees, has successively opened soap making, rattan weaving, sewing, radio, and chemical engineering production training classes. One month ago, it added an automobile driving and repair training class at the first workshop of the Dunxin Road First Shelter. I made a special trip to visit it yesterday.

At ten o'clock that morning, led by the administrator of the First Workshop, I entered the automobile repair department of the workshop. I saw three groups of students, each under the guidance of a technician, practicing repairing motors separately. Each group of students had about ten people, all around the age of twenty-five. They held automobile repair tools, trying to knock and wrench; after a while, they carefully inspected and tested; if the test failed, they concentrated and thought, discussing. Several technicians were on the side, ready to answer their inquiries and give them appropriate guidance. At that time, the small workshop was filled with an atmosphere of research, interrupted by the sound of ding-ding, floating with the smell of gasoline, and even more active with promising young students. There was an old automobile there, said to belong to the Refugee Relief Association, which was almost repaired.

Director Xiong of the Automobile Training Class earnestly told me: "Every morning from eight to ten o'clock, we lecture on automobile science, focusing on the structural principles of automobiles; from ten to eleven o'clock and from one to four o'clock in the afternoon, it is all practice time, and the most important thing is workshop practice. Every morning, they will automatically do collective morning exercises; on Sundays, we invite famous educators to give spiritual speeches, which is the most interesting course for them after they have become accustomed to six days of mechanical life."

He paused for a while, and then said with a smile: "The technology of driving automobiles will also begin to be trained after two trucks arrive within ten months. At that time, fifty students will alternate learning automobile driving and repair, hoping that within the planned training period of six months, they will acquire the most practical functions of driving and repairing automobiles. Once a grand graduation ceremony is held, they will be sent to the interior to do some meaningful work."

Finally, I said very happily: "I admire the practicality of your work and wish you success in cultivating technical talents."

### Chapter 16: Learning Foreign Affairs, Reporters Enter a New Field; Serving Internal Affairs, the School Show is Small

It is said that Zhu Airen received a call from her grandfather to discuss the establishment of a nursery in Freedom Village. On the one hand, she requested instructions from Dr. Lao Zhang, and on the other hand, she discussed it with the He sisters. Both sides were extremely supportive. Dr. Lao Zhang also promised to do his best to help. If there was a shortage of manpower and material resources, they could be dispatched from their own nursery. Originally, the Women and Children's Hospital wanted to set up a branch in Freedom Village. First, because the population of Freedom Village was not large at that time; second, because there was a temporary lack of talent in Anle Town, they only sent Zhu Aiqun alone. Now, the population of Freedom Village has also increased, and many new citizens are added every month. Dr. Lao Zhang felt that Zhu Aiqun alone was not enough. Therefore, he sent a few more people to be Zhu Aiqun's assistants, simply forming an obstetrics hospital. This was prepared in terms of obstetrics, but not much attention was paid to the care of infants. At first, in Anle Town, there was also a lack of talent. All the nannies were only enough for their own use. Now, because of economic affluence and abundant talent, it doesn't matter if they send a few people out. Moreover, Dr. Lao Zhang is currently thinking about cultivating many new people for use in various places. If the nursery in Freedom Village is run together with the obstetrics hospital, it may be a good idea. As for the two He sisters, they are now running this silk weaving factory, and they must seek innovation. They know that now all factories that use many female workers often have nurseries attached to them. In foreign countries, the first is the Soviet Union, and the second is the United States, and they are all like this. Leaving aside foreign countries and speaking of domestic ones, there are also many textile factories, factories with female workers as the mainstay, that have also established nurseries. How could they not establish one? However, the nurseries set up in factories are slightly different from the nurseries set up locally. Whether to run them together or separately depends on the situation. In short, support is unnecessary to say, it will definitely be supported. The next day, Saturday, Dr. Lao Zhang said to Zhu Airen: "Although the hospital is very busy, everything here is now on track. It doesn't matter if you are away for a few days. Anyway, I won't go there. I can take care of your affairs for you. It is rare for you to come to Shanghai. Perhaps your classmates and sisters want to keep you for a few more days, so you should stay for a few more days. It is best to see Mrs. Su Ya and talk to her in detail, or invite her to visit us. You should know that we are not flattering foreigners. We are doing things for society, and we cannot divide national boundaries. If she is willing to help us, we must rely on her." (193)

Entertainment World

### Tokyo's Elastic Daughters

Tokyo's entertainment industry has been declining day by day since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. According to Japanese newspapers, dance halls and mahjong associations in amusement places have been hit the hardest, and dance girls feel the pain of unemployment and idleness. Since the police station issued regulations last year that each dance floor must close early every night, refuse female guests, male guests must implement registration procedures, and new dance stars are not allowed to go to sea, the fate of elastic daughters has been shrouded in recession. During the heyday, there were no fewer than a thousand professional dancers in Tokyo, gradually eliminated to only one hundred and fifty people. Recently, there are only two hundred and fifty people left. Some have changed industries, and some have gone to Shanghai, Harbin, and other places to make a living. The income of the remaining two hundred and fifty dancers is also getting worse and worse. The red dancers used to earn three or four hundred yen a month, but now it is a miracle to have an income of sixty yen. Moreover, prices are expensive, and the dancers' outfits cannot be too casual. The high expenses of silk machines, leather shoes, and perfumes make them feel very difficult. As for mahjong associations, there were six hundred in Tokyo. Since the ban on establishing new associations last year, the situation has been desolate. In addition, the one thousand and six pachinko parlors in the city are also the same. Instead, the business of archery and shooting has sprung up. Most of them are held indoors and often have classical colors. A five-hundred-yuan investment can produce twenty to fifty yuan a day. In addition, there are also those who enjoy dancing with large knives. On the surface, they are responding to the war, but in reality, it is still a kind of entertainment behavior that is better than nothing, which is really a symbol of depression.

### Miss Hua Huilin's Maiden Work: Empress Dowager Cixi on the Silver Screen

— Cui Ping

——Inviting Wang Yaoqing South as Consultant

The famous Kunqu actress Hua Huilin, in Shanghai, collaborated with Ma Lianliang, Gao Qingkui, and Qilin Tong in joint performances, earning widespread acclaim in the artistic world and the admiration of Zhou Lang. In recent years, Hua Huilin has removed her operatic robes and led a leisurely life in the north. After the National Army withdrew from Shanghai, Hua Huilin took refuge in Hong Kong. Eventually, the extreme quiet led to a desire for movement. Seeing the booming film industry and the popularity of historical costume dramas, she conceived the idea of starring in a historical costume film. The authoritative director of historical costume films, Mr. Wang JueLong, happened to be in Hong Kong. Hua Huilin discussed the matter with Director Wang, who greatly approved. Hua Huilin was concerned whether her facial features met the requirements for appearing on camera, and whether her expressions and movements were suitable for cinematic adaptation. Hua Huilin, regarding

the art of film,

although she had conducted in-depth research in ordinary times, had never attempted it in practice, so she dared not be confident. For the sake of caution, she specially arranged a trial shooting of a short historical costume film at the South China Film Company a few days ago. Hua Huilin, dressed as Yingying from "Romance of the West Chamber," under the guidance of Director Wang, shot more than ten takes, including long shots, medium shots, close-ups, extreme close-ups, and tracking shots, all with sound. After the test screening on the screen, Hua Huilin's expressions and movements were all described as fully expressing the state of mind, meeting the requirements of the screen. The dialogue was clear and articulate, washing away stage habits, and Hua Huilin also expressed self-satisfaction. She immediately asked Director Wang to choose a historical story suitable for her performance. Wang instructed his favorite student, Mr. Ding Ning, to adapt a period of

power struggles

from the Qing Dynasty, from the time Empress Dowager Cixi entered the palace to the time her son, the Tongzhi Emperor, ascended the throne, into a screenplay. Ding collected unofficial histories and novels about Empress Dowager Cixi for research, and Director Wang and experts on Qing Dynasty history participated to offer their opinions. The entire screenplay has been completed and will be filmed in the near future, directed by Wang. The costumes and sets in the film will also be designed by Ding Ning. Because this film features many grand palace scenes, it would be even more magnificent if filmed in color, so Hua Huilin is considering shooting it as a color film.

When Empress Dowager Cixi entered the palace, she was at the prime of her youth, and when her son, the Tongzhi Emperor, ascended the throne, she was only in her thirties. This role is quite suitable

for Hua Huilin to play.

Huilin is the favorite female disciple of the old opera master Wang Yaoqing (Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, and the female actress Cao Eyun, among the Four Great Dan, also came from Wang Yaoqing's school). When Wang Yaoqing was at the height of his fame in the old capital's opera scene, he was repeatedly selected to perform in the palace and was greatly praised by Empress Dowager Cixi. Wang is very familiar with the situation in the palace at that time, with details that cannot be fully recorded in historical books. Hua Huilin hopes to invite her teacher to come south to act as a consultant for the filming of this film, but the old opera master is already in his twilight years, and traveling from the north to Hong Kong, crossing rivers and seas, and traveling by boat for a long time, may not be able to withstand the hardships of wind and waves, so coming south may not be possible.

Furthermore, as this article was being completed, it was learned that Hua Huilin had made a special trip to Beijing to bring her teacher south. However, whether the old man can come along is still uncertain.

Miss Xiao is quite talented in acting and is currently an actress at the Shanghai Drama Society. Above is a still from the play "Love Sea of Doubt". (Xin)

### ### The Private Life of Mei Lanfang

— Li Feishu

Mr. Mei's voice, usually at home, is never practiced. But once on stage, it naturally resonates through the audience! This is truly a gifted voice, something that cannot be achieved through human effort.

His usual attire is always Western-style. In the past ten years, except for wearing a few Chinese outfits while living abroad, he has never worn them in China. It's not that he's trying to be fashionable, his reason is: "Wearing Western clothes is more energetic! It's easier to work and walk! When wearing Chinese clothes abroad, it's because foreigners always look at Chinese people with special eyes. I insist on wearing Chinese clothes to let them know that I am a Chinese person. At the same time, it also reminds me not to forget that I am a Chinese person at all times."

When he is at home, his clothes are neat and tidy. His speech and movements are dignified and composed. When sitting, he never slouches. He takes great care of every small detail. He always finishes what he starts, which is the opposite of my personality. Every time I finish writing something, I just leave it. Gaimo (nickname), Tao Bi Mao, often suffers for it. From this, it can be seen that Mr. Mei is sure to have a long life, while I am afraid that I will soon receive a telegram from Comrade Yan Hui, summoning me to the Nine Springs to attend the so-called peace conference!

Mr. Mei has been keeping a low profile in Hong Kong recently, rarely socializing. His life is even more disciplined. Every day he reads Chinese, studies English, paints, and listens to the radio, using these four tasks to pass the long nights, waiting for the dawn of the East.

The writing is getting longer and longer. This is not a biography of Mr. Mei, so let's use a term from the opera troupe as a conclusion! "Let's stop here."

### ### New Film Introduction: Gratitude Repaid

— Qi Hua

"The Forgotten Woman"

Besides acting in "The Mad Empress," I don't know what other works Sigrid Gurie has done, but the bewitching woman in "The Mad Empress" was played very vividly. Annie in "Mother and Son's Deep Love" is the exact opposite of her previous role. She is a mother who is wrongly imprisoned, causing her son to be sent to an orphanage. Although this role cannot be played to ideal success, when she meets David and angrily rebukes him for sentencing her to ten years and taking her son away, the grief, anger, and sorrow in her cries prove that she is capable of playing such roles. However, the playwright inserted another subplot into this tragedy—exposing the conspiracy of the politician Charlie Cotrell and David's courage to admit his mistakes and not succumb to coercion—which weakened the main storyline. At the same time, the director, in several important scenes such as David questioning Annie, Annie being released on bail and meeting her son at the orphanage, and the child being hit by a car and taken to the hospital for treatment, failed to give Sigrid Gurie more opportunities to act. Therefore, Annie's role, in the audience's impression, is not as good as the bewitching woman in "The Mad Empress." Under the two parallel storylines, the director failed to integrate them harmoniously, and casually let go of several important scenes, resulting in the entire film being in a very loose and dull state.

### ### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Times have changed, and the above three feudal-era titles will certainly no longer exist; therefore, nicknames like Hao Shouchun's "Jesus" and Yang Baozhong's "Foreigner" are fresh and exotic, quite different from the past. As for how Hao and others got their names, it was because Hao was a Christian who liked to talk to people about Jesus, while Yang liked to wear Western suits and play Western music, so they each got their beautiful nicknames. In addition, there is a lagging young actor, Wang You , whose nickname is quite humorous and appropriate. When he and Cheng Yanqiu were in the same troupe, the audience only saw him seemingly breathing out of his nostrils, with his upper and lower lips completely still. After singing for a long time, not a single word could be heard, and even the musicians and drummers felt the same way. Therefore, everyone gave him the nickname "Heart Reaches, God Knows." I think anyone who has heard Father Tea's opera, recalling it, will agree that this elegant nickname is very apt and interesting.

The Problem of Gold and Silver in the Play "Wulongyuan"

I am not an economic expert, so my research on the problem of gold and silver is not as significant as the problem of gold and silver between China and the United States. I just happen to love opera, so this problem is still inseparable from the scope of drama. Please see below:

Some time ago, at Huang Yu, I saw Song Dezhu and Yang Shisen's "Wulongyuan." In this play, regarding the problem of gold and silver, the two people handled it differently. Bao Sen always said in his lines that there was a tael of gold in the summoning bag, while Dezhu, after Song Jiang hurriedly went downstairs and picked up the summoning bag, changed the lines to say "a tael of silver, to be kept for Sanlang to buy candy." Belonging to the same item, the two protagonists in the play actually treated it as gold, while the other treated it as silver. Although it is such a small difference, it makes the preceding and following plots somewhat inconsistent. Let me explain in detail below:——(123)
