### America Adopts a Strong Stance in the Far East, Highly Praised by All Sides; US Troops Receive Orders to Use Force if Necessary to Protect Nationals; British Ambassador Craig Visits Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Expressing Agreement with the US Stance; Japanese Spokesperson Still Claims Their Established Policy Remains Unchanged

(New York) The firm stance taken by Britain, France, and the United States in handling the Kulangsu (Gulangyu) incident has been met with satisfaction from various agricultural newspapers here, all of whom regard this action as an unprecedented move to curb Japan's ambitions to expel Western nations from China. The Democratic Party's New York Times stated, "Wherever Japan's influence extends, foreign interests are severely eroded, and what remains is only a portion adapted to Japan's plans. Although this has been repeatedly denied by that country, it is undeniable when considering the facts. However, the amount of Japanese goods exported to Britain, France, and the United States accounts for one-quarter to one-third of its total exports. Therefore, how can Japan lightly disregard the interests of these countries?" The Republican Party's New York Herald Tribune stated, "The actions taken by Western nations in Kulangsu and the US State Department's note regarding the Shanghai International Settlement are both considered satisfactory. Japan's brazen demand to control these international settlements rightly evokes strong resentment." (Havas, 19th)

(London) The Kulangsu incident was recently commented on by The Times, saying, "Such incidents seem clumsy and will not be the second to occur, nor will they be the last. Since the Sino-Japanese War, the relationship between Japanese soldiers and foreign settlements in China has been like that between a small dog and a hedgehog. The small dog barks incessantly, while the hedgehog seems wary and restrains its activities. However, the small dog resumes its activity from time to time, making tentative attacks. The settlements in Tianjin and Shanghai have already been eroded, and in the past week, there was the incident in Kulangsu. Their intention is clear, but they have not yet succeeded, simply because of their nature, and it is not necessary to expect them to cease their activities abruptly." (Havas, 19th)

(London) The Far East is now showing us an example of how to deal with dictators: treat them firmly. The position of Kulangsu is similar to that of the Shanghai International Settlement. If democratic countries concede in Kulangsu, it will be difficult to gain a foothold in Shanghai in the future. The landing of Japanese marines in Kulangsu was a probing act, but after the British, American, and French authorities displayed admirable firmness, Japan began to withdraw its troops. The Birmingham Post stated that since the Sino-Japanese War, the best action taken by democratic countries in the Far East to protect their own interests has been the handling of the Xiamen (Amoy) incident. (Reuters, 19th)

(Hong Kong) On May 3rd, the Japanese government sent a note to the British and American governments, explaining the Japanese government's views on maintaining the Shanghai International Settlement. The US government expressed its inability to agree on the 17th. Now, the British government has also taken the same step as the US government. At 11:00 AM on the 19th, British Ambassador Craig visited Vice Minister Sawada to clarify that his views were the same as those of the US government. However, the Japanese government believes that the reform of the International Settlement's institutions is a necessary condition for building a "New Order in East Asia," so it will continue to advance according to its established policy. (19th)

(Washington) It was revealed by the State Department today that US forces in the Far East have received orders to use force if necessary to protect Americans residing in the Kulangsu International Settlement. Currently, the US light cruiser "Marblehead" and destroyer "Rathburne" are docked in Xiamen. At the same time, 42 US soldiers under the command of officers landed in Kulangsu yesterday. Britain and France have also landed with similar military strength. The strength of the foreign troops currently landed is equal to the number of Japanese troops still stationed in Kulangsu who have not yet withdrawn. (Associated Press, 18th)

(Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry declared today that the Japanese marines who landed in Kulangsu did not disturb any foreigners in the International Settlement, and the news reported by foreign newspapers is not true. The spokesperson expressed regret for the joint action of Britain, the United States, and France in concentrating warships and sending sailors to land in Kulangsu, because the reason for this action by Britain, the United States, and France was that the Japanese landing forces had searched foreigners. In fact, the Japanese side did not search foreigners, nor did it disturb any foreign residents. The spokesperson also stated that last year, Japanese marines patrolled Kulangsu for two months, and no country raised any objections or protests, nor did foreign warships send sailors to land. The spokesperson continued, the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops landing in Kulangsu will depend entirely on the development of the future situation and will not be withdrawn due to protests from any country. The Japanese forces that landed have now been reduced to the minimum, and most have been withdrawn due to the easing of the situation. The spokesperson concluded that this withdrawal was entirely voluntary and solemnly stated that the landing of Japanese marines was entirely an emergency measure to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents and the safety of the commander of the South China Fleet, as it occurred on the day that Hong Lixun (transliteration), the chairman of the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce, was assassinated. (Reuters, 19th)

(Tokyo) A spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry expressed his opinion today, believing that no country can change Japan's established policy on the issue of public settlements and foreign concessions in China. However, the Japanese government will continue to maintain friendly negotiations with relevant foreign countries to seek a solution to this issue. In response to a question about the US government's rejection of Japan's request to expand its power in the Shanghai International Settlement's Municipal Council, the spokesperson said that the Japanese government did not request countries to respond to its memorandum on the Shanghai International Settlement policy, and also said that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai are currently conducting negotiations with the Municipal Council on reorganizing the Municipal Council and maintaining peace and order in the International Settlement. (Reuters, 19th)

(Chongqing) Chinese officials today strongly supported the attitude taken by the United States, Britain, and France towards the Japanese military occupation of Kulangsu, calling it a "determining factor" in protecting the interests of third countries in China and their rights in the International Settlement. A financial magnate told the Associated Press that force is the only way to deal with it. This action by third countries indicates that they can no longer tolerate Japan's encroachment on the International Settlement. This move has undoubtedly prevented the same incident from occurring in the Shanghai and Tianjin settlements. (Associated Press, 19th)

Editorial

### Analysis of the Anti-British Movement

Since the beginning of the war, Japan has often conducted its two-pronged diplomacy towards Britain, the country with the greatest interest in the Far East, sometimes enticing, sometimes threatening, and sometimes using both tactics simultaneously, in a constantly shifting and unpredictable manner, seemingly containing countless contradictions. However, rather than calling this a contradiction, it would be more accurate to say that it is two edges of the same sword of Japan; although the dynamics are opposite, the effect is the same. The purpose of enticement is nothing more than to lure Britain into a trap and abandon its rights and interests in the Far East, while the purpose of threat is nothing more than to force Britain to disarm and abandon its rights and interests in the Far East. If Britain can abandon its rights and interests in the Far East, other countries such as the United States and France can follow suit. Thus, Konoe's proposal of December 22nd last year can be realized, and Japan's goal of excluding Europe and America and dominating East Asia can be achieved. This can be said to be Japan's more important intention.

The most recent manifestation of enticement is in Japan's non-participation in the Tripartite Military Alliance, which seems to have reached a delicate state of flirtatious overtures. As for threats, there are too many examples; as soon as Ambassador Kerr arrived in Chongqing, Chongqing suffered a major bombing; as soon as he arrived in Chengdu, Chengdu had an air raid warning, forcing the ambassador to spend the night in the open, catching a cold; the anti-British movement in the occupied areas is increasing day by day; recently, it has intensified and spread to Shanghai. For example, on Dixwell Road in Hongkou the day before yesterday afternoon, some underage children distributed so-called anti-British leaflets. This phenomenon of one positive and one negative simultaneously reaching a climax is nothing more than an indication that Japan's attempt on Britain has reached the degree of "monkey in a hurry," as the Shanghai dialect says.

Why is Japan in such a "monkey in a hurry"? From the subjective needs, Japan has known since the beginning of the war that it has little certainty of success. Therefore, on the one hand, it attempts to reduce the assistance of various countries to China, weakening China's ability to resist; on the other hand, it carries out the work of consolidating its power in the occupied areas, excluding the rights and interests of third parties in China, in order to achieve its ambition of exclusive occupation. Under this dual attempt, Japan believes that the most important target should be Britain, which has the deepest relationship with the Far East; therefore, its diplomatic work has always been focused on Britain. If Britain takes the bait and expresses its submission to him, this is certainly what the Japanese side fervently prays for; otherwise, as a backup plan, if Britain, because it cannot bear the annoyance of constant nagging, comes out to mediate peace, forcing China to accept a treaty under duress, it may not be an additional gain for the Japanese side. This wishful thinking of the Japanese side has certainly been around for a long time, not just recently; but recently its attempt has become more urgent. Originally, Japan's military situation in China is now gradually falling into an unfavorable position. Not only does the planned attack on the Northwest and Southwest by the "Itagaki Truce Line" have no certainty of success, but even the points and lines already occupied are also exposing a wavering appearance in the Chinese army's tentative April offensive. Therefore, under the emotion of anxiety and irritability, the Japanese army has to step up its search for a way out, so the attempt to use Britain has become even more urgent.

From the objective situation, the organization of the world's anti-aggression group has recently had the possibility of success; even if this organization does not include the Far East, if Europe can temporarily maintain a modest life, countries will shift their attention to the Far East, which is also a matter of course. The Japanese side is of course wary of this, so it hopes to seize the rights and interests of various countries in China as soon as possible before the anti-aggression group organization is completed. Britain is the country with the greatest interest in China, and at the same time, Britain occupies a leading position in the world's anti-aggression group organization. Therefore, under the concept of "to draw a bow, draw the strong; to catch a thief, catch the king first," Japan is again eager to exclude Britain.

In short, it is afraid of and hates Britain, and has always been so, and is even more so now; Japan hopes that Britain will be afraid of his nagging and fall into his trap, and has always had such a plan, but now it is planning more urgently. However, what is the effect of this attempt by Japan? In fact, as Japan step by step intensifies its pressure on Britain, Britain step by step intensifies its assistance to China; as Japan step by step threatens Britain's rights and interests in China, Britain step by step changes to using strong methods to protect its rights and interests; as Japan step by step attempts to divide the countries with Far East relations, Britain step by step unites the countries and takes consistent action. From all aspects, Britain not only has not fallen into Japan's trap, but also fully expressed its determination to safeguard its rights and interests in the recent Kulangsu incident. So, what did Japan get? What he got was the opposite of his expectations, namely, Britain's toughness and the unity of the countries with Britain's attitude. In fact, this helped China, not Japan. All the attempts of the Japanese side have obviously failed, and the means of capture and release that he has always used have ultimately found no room to be used.

From now on, the pseudo-anti-British movement orchestrated by Japan in China will probably not stop, but its essence will inevitably shift from the means of capture and release to acts of venting anger; however, this downhill method will only result in falling into a more anxious and irritable situation, and there will be no benefit to the facts!

### American Attitude is Firm, British Newspapers Express Excitement

(London) The Manchester Guardian stated in an editorial today that Japan intends to create the Kulangsu International Settlement incident in Xiamen in order to test the reaction of Western powers, focusing on the more important situation in Shanghai. The most exciting point in the Kulangsu incident is the attitude of the US government. The US government first protested, first sent its commander-in-chief to Kulangsu, and first sent marines to land on the island. The United States has consistently expressed its willingness to cooperate with Britain and has never evaded its obligations. This attitude should inspire the timid British government, which still advocates a policy of appeasement in the Far East after the policy of appeasement in Europe failed. The only result of this policy is to encourage violent anti-British movements within Japan and in areas occupied by Japanese troops in China. Japan's movement is undoubtedly based on the theory of attacking the weakest point of the enemy's line. The United States is prepared to cooperate to protect our common interests in Kulangsu. From this, it can be inferred that the United States will also be willing to take the same action in Shanghai or elsewhere in the Far East if necessary. We are comforted by this, and the fear of many people that the Anglo-Soviet alliance will have an adverse effect on Japanese policy should also be dispelled. (Reuters, 19th) The full text of the US note to Japan is on page 6.

### Three Countries Suggest to Japan Simultaneous Withdrawal of Military Forces

(Hong Kong) According to information leaked from Japanese authorities today, the naval authorities of the United States, Britain, and France in Kulangsu yesterday jointly suggested to the Japanese naval commander that all armed soldiers in the International Settlement should withdraw together simultaneously. The content of the Japanese response to this suggestion has not yet been released. Naval authorities here believe that this report is quite accurate because all parties have discussed the plan to convene a meeting to discuss the withdrawal of all armed soldiers from Kulangsu. (Associated Press, 19th)

(London) The British government notified Japan yesterday, stating that the number of British Royal Marines landed in Kulangsu will be reduced to an equal number as the Japanese troops in that area. According to government sources, the number of British naval personnel currently landed in Kulangsu is indeed 42, which is exactly equal to the number of Japanese troops on the island. (Associated Press, 19th)

### Sawada Discusses Kulangsu Incident with British Ambassador

(Tokyo) Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Sawada met with British Ambassador Craig yesterday to discuss the Kulangsu incident. At the same time, officials announced that Japan had responded to the British protest of May 16 regarding the landing of Japanese naval personnel in Kulangsu. The response stated that there were three reasons for the landing of Japanese naval personnel: emergency measures to arrest terrorists, to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents, and to protect the commander of the Japanese South China Fleet, who is currently visiting Kulangsu. At the same time, it was guaranteed that as soon as the tension in Kulangsu eased, the Japanese navy would gradually withdraw. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)

(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Arita met with US Ambassador to Japan Grew yesterday before Grew departed for home, informing him that the US rejection of Japan's proposal to reorganize the Shanghai International Settlement's Municipal Council will make it impossible to clarify the issues between the US and Japan in China. Arita continued that he believed that if the United States abandoned the idea of an international conference and engaged in direct negotiations with Japan, some issues between the US and Japan could be resolved, but only on the condition that the United States recognize Japan's general position in the Far East. Arita further stated that Japan's plan to "reorganize the Far East" does not hinder the development of American interests in China, and at the same time, Japan's development of its interests in the Far East outside of China will not conflict with the United States. (Haitong News Agency, 19th)

### Three Major Democratic Countries Jointly Protect Far Eastern Interests

(Paris) After the naval landing of British, French, and American marines simultaneously in Kulangsu, China, government officials here commented that the three major democratic countries have a joint relationship and have now decided to jointly protect their interests in the Far East. The matter of merely protesting diplomatically has become a thing of the past. Germany and Italy are now pressuring Japan to join the military alliance treaty. If that country is encouraged by Germany and Italy to pursue an anti-French and anti-British policy, then Britain, France, and the United States should jointly take defensive measures to deal with it. The British government recently convened a Pacific conference in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, to discuss the protection of territories in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The defense plan agreed upon advocated cooperation between Britain and France to mutually protect all territories. The British government has notified France of the results of the conference, and the United States has also actually joined this defense organization. (Havas, 18th)

(Paris) The Kulangsu incident and the Shanghai International Settlement issue were recently commented on by various newspapers, all saying that the attitude taken by Western countries is very satisfactory. The right-wing Petit Journal stated, "Britain, France, and the United States are now making simultaneous efforts in the Far East, no longer making any unilateral concessions. The United States government, regardless of the opposition of isolationists, is actively protecting its interests in China. This is why the Kulangsu incident has special significance." (Havas, 19th)

### Japanese Newspapers Still Want to Advocate Taking Decisive Steps

(Tokyo) This morning, newspapers prominently published the news of the US rejection of the Japanese request to reorganize the Shanghai Municipal Council and the landing of British, American, and French sailors in Kulangsu, stating that this move by the three countries has caused a delicate situation. It is generally believed that this is a test of Japan's strength and determination regarding the current international situation and the various issues related to the foreign concessions in Shanghai and Tianjin. According to the Asahi Shimbun, "After a Japanese marine unit withdrew, Britain and the United States sent sailors to land in Kulangsu, which is clear evidence of Britain and the United States taking an aggressive attitude. If Britain and the United States allow the 'Chiang Kai-shek regime' to orchestrate anti-Japanese organizations in the Shanghai International Settlement, then Japan should demand the transfer of the concession's administrative power. In view of the 'uncompromising' attitude of Britain and the United States, Japan's determination to stand firm is even more urgent than before." The Nichinichi Shimbun stated that Japan must take decisive steps to deal with the actions of Britain, the United States, and France. (Reuters, 18th)

### Fierce Battles in Northern Hubei and Southern Henan for Two Weeks: Chinese Army Achieves Important Victory; Japanese Encirclement Fails, Communication Severed, Casualties Reach Half of Their Total; Main Force of Chinese Army Now Able to Control the Overall Situation; Rumor of Recapture of Zao Yang in Progress

(Hong Kong) Laohekou Electric Dispatch: Fierce battles have raged in northern Hubei and southern Henan for two weeks. By the 18th, Japanese casualties had reached 17,000 to 18,000 men, accounting for nearly one-third of their total force. Their plan to invade Xiangfan has been shattered. Currently, the main force of the Chinese army is controlling the overall situation, continuing to engage in fierce battles with the Japanese army in the area north of Suixian and Zao Yang, and south of Tongbai and Xinye. Remnants of the Japanese army near Tanghe and Xinye have all been cleared. Chinese forces in the Zhongxiang area have occupied Majiaji and Xipanshi Bridge. More than 400 Japanese soldiers, arriving from Jingshan in over 70 vehicles, were ambushed by Chinese guerrillas and fled in disarray northwards along the highway. All the Japanese vehicles and supplies were burned by the Chinese army. Subsequently, the Japanese launched a counterattack, resulting in a fierce two-hour battle, in which over a hundred Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese army reinforced from Dongqiao, and the situation remains in stalemate. (19th Special Dispatch)

(Yichang) The Chinese army is advancing towards the Jing-Zhong Road, launching gradual attacks. On the 18th, they reached the vicinity of Sunqiao, poised to deal a fatal blow to the Japanese forces in Jingshan and Zhongxiang. The highway around Zaoshi on the Han-Yi Road has been destroyed by the Chinese army, and Japanese communication has been severed. In northern Hubei, the Chinese army recaptured the key points of Zhangjiaji and Gushan on the 18th, and is continuing to pursue the enemy westward. (19th Electric Dispatch)

Fancheng: Chinese and Japanese forces in central Hubei are still engaged in a state of mixed fighting. The front lines of each road have formed into a large tooth shape. The Chinese army's attacking units on the Han-Yi and Zhong-Jing Roads are still advancing bravely. If the Japanese army north of Zao Yang attempts to flee south, they will be affected by the Chinese army's rear attacks. Currently, there are signs that the Japanese army is receiving reinforcements. (19th Electric Dispatch)

(Chongqing) The Chinese military authorities are unwilling to disclose details of the battle in northern Hubei, but according to reliable sources, the Chinese army has achieved an important victory in a well-planned and swiftly executed counteroffensive. However, as the battle is still in progress, the full significance of this victory will be seen later. Reuters learned from reliable sources that the Japanese army launched a sudden encirclement operation at the beginning of this month, hoping to surround the Chinese army in the Suixian area with two wings. At that time, the main force of the Chinese army in Tanghe immediately retreated in two directions, one heading north to Nanyang, and the other west to Xiangyang. After the Japanese army established communication in Tanghe, Tang Enbo's army corps launched a sudden counterattack, and the Chinese army that had previously withdrawn from Tanghe also returned at the same time to join the counterattack, creating a powerful force. The Japanese army, having penetrated deep into the area, felt fatigued and was cut off from the main force. They had no choice but to retreat to Zao Yang. It is estimated that more than ten thousand Japanese soldiers were killed in this battle. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy, passing through the foot of the Dahong Mountains, where the road was lined with the corpses of Japanese soldiers. According to Chinese military authorities, the Japanese side previously boasted of encircling 20 divisions of the Chinese army in northern Hubei, but now they are suddenly silent. This is proof of the Chinese army's victory. (19th Reuters Electric Dispatch)

Nanyang: The war situation in northern Hubei is progressing extremely rapidly since the Chinese army fiercely attacked. Yesterday, a certain unit of the Chinese army successively captured Dongyangwan and Laoying (both west of Zao Yang). In the afternoon, a certain unit recaptured Zhangjiaji and Lueshan and other places, killing a large number of Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army abandoned their machine guns and fled. The Chinese army is advancing rapidly towards Zao Yang. There are rumors that Zao Yang has been recaptured. On the Zhongxiang front, the Chinese army fiercely attacked Xia Ya Port (near Wamiaoji) yesterday morning, annihilating over half of the Japanese army. Xia Ya Port was immediately recaptured. Currently, the Han-Yi Road has been cut off, and that area is surrounded by the Chinese army. (19th Electric Dispatch)

(Luoyang) The Japanese army in southern Henan, having been routed by the Chinese army, fled in disarray to Zao Yang. More than 4,000 remnants of the Japanese army have now gathered in that area. Under the pressure of the superior Chinese army, they are unable to stand their ground. They withdrew in large numbers on the afternoon of the 18th, attempting to cross the river at Dongjinwan in a surprise attack, but were unsuccessful. They have now gathered in the Lueshan Fangjiaji area, but they no longer have combat capability. However, over 30,000 Japanese soldiers in Suixian, Junchuan, and other places appear to be preparing to invade westward. (19th Electric Dispatch)

(Luoyang) On the morning of the 16th, after the Chinese army recaptured Tongbai, the army took advantage of the momentum to attack. The remnants of the Japanese army fled in disarray towards the south of the city. Two or three hundred Japanese soldiers in Xiaolin Village east of Tongbai were also repelled by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 15th, a certain unit of the Chinese army encountered over a thousand Japanese soldiers in Jinqiao (east of Tongbai), engaging in a fierce battle until noon. The Japanese gradually became unable to withstand the attack and appeared to be fleeing eastwards. In this battle, hundreds of Japanese soldiers, including the Japanese captain Ueta, were killed, and countless spoils of war were seized. (19th Electric Dispatch)

(Chongqing) Because telegraph communication between Xiangyang and Chongqing has been disrupted, the situation of the war in northern Hubei is quite unclear here. Chinese military figures still express optimism. It is said that the Japanese army advancing towards Xiangyang and Fancheng has been blocked by the Chinese army. As for the cause of the telegraph line disruption, it is the result of heavy bombing by the Japanese army. According to news received from the front lines, fierce battles are currently taking place in Zao Yang, 60 kilometers east of Xiangyang. The Japanese army is now attempting a semi-circular encirclement of Xiangyang, starting from Suixian in the north, Zao Yang in the center, and Zhongxiang in the south. The progress of this situation is still unknown. In order to resist the Japanese encirclement, the Chinese army suddenly launched a counterattack on the Han-Yi Highway, with satisfactory results. After recently recovering Yuejiakou and Wamiaoji, they are now pressing on the military stronghold of Qiuxian (transliteration). If they launch a surprise attack, the position of the Chinese army in Hanshui can be greatly relieved. (19th Haitong News Agency Electric Dispatch)

### Eastern Shandong Chinese Army Recaptures Qixia

A certain place in Shandong: On the 11th and 12th, the Japanese army occupying Huangxian launched a fierce attack on Qixia, using aircraft to bomb Qixia, Laiyang, and other places, causing Qixia to fall into Japanese hands on the 12th. On the morning of the 13th, the Chinese army bravely counterattacked, engaging in a fierce battle with the Japanese army for five hours, killing over half of the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese army was unable to withstand the attack and fled towards Huangxian. Qixia was subsequently recaptured. (19th Electric Dispatch)

### Japanese Army Ambushed and Suffers Miserable Defeat East of Jingle

Xingji: Over two hundred Japanese soldiers stationed in Kangjia Hui and Lirun east of Jingle County, carrying several mountain guns, advanced towards Dahui. In advance, the Chinese army ambushed troops between Phoenix Mountain and the north and south mountains of Qiaomen. When the Japanese army approached, they fired at the Japanese army with fierce firepower. After several hours of fierce fighting, over eighty Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese suffered a major setback and released poisonous gas to cover their retreat back to their original positions. (19th Electric Dispatch)

Currently, many puppet soldiers and civilians in that area have been killed. Everyone is in danger, and they are leaving the city one after another to join the Chinese army. (19th Electric Dispatch)

Tunxi: Over six hundred Japanese soldiers stationed in Lianshui and Funing in northern Jiangsu, with eight cannons attached, were constantly harassing the Sujiazu and Fenggu Village areas. After the Chinese army intercepted and attacked them separately, all of them were routed by the Chinese army the day before yesterday evening. Two Japanese officers and over a hundred soldiers were killed. The remnants of the Japanese army fled to Funing. (19th Electric Dispatch)

### Soviet Newspaper Discusses China's Counteroffensive Achievements

(Moscow) Red Star Newspaper reviewed the recent situation of the Chinese war, stating, "Since the Chinese army began active operations, more than a month has passed. During this period, the Chinese army has been able to maintain the initiative at any time and place. The Japanese army in many cities and towns has been driven out and suffered a large number of casualties and loss of military equipment. The Chinese army's combat effectiveness and determination have been increasing day by day. The activities of its air defense forces have been particularly effective. Its air force has repeatedly bombed Japanese army positions, all with remarkable results. The activities of the Chinese guerrillas have also become more active. The Japanese army clearly has no hope of eliminating them. The result of this active operation by the Chinese army has made the vast majority of the Chinese people swear to resist aggression to the death and strive for final victory. Its spirit and will have become stronger. All aspects of its counteroffensive have been successful and have completely resolved all the tasks assigned by the highest military authorities."

According to news obtained by Reuters, China will strongly urge the League of Nations at the next meeting of the Council to organize the necessary institutions to exert more effective pressure on Japan, instead of just making empty promises to the powers to do their best to help China. So far, all that China has received from the League of Nations is this suggestion. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, and Maisky, the Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom, plan to depart for Geneva at the same time tomorrow, and will meet with Gu Weijun, the Ambassador to France, in Paris. Guo and Gu will both be representatives of China to the League of Nations, but the important task of representing China at the Council will mostly be assumed by Gu, as in the past.

### At the National Production Conference: President Kong's Closing Address: Must Adapt to the Requirements of the Times, Strive for Practical and Effective Methods

(Chongqing) In his closing address at the National Production Conference, President Kong said approximately: "Despite the obstruction of transportation, all members have enthusiastically participated in the conference after traveling long distances, concentrating their minds and jointly discussing the major plans for national production and construction. They have worked hard day and night, and have remained persistent throughout. I am deeply impressed by their calmness in handling affairs, their dedication, and their loyalty to the country. The essence of the production conference lies in mobilizing the nation's human and material resources to achieve the goal of making the best use of people's talents, land's resources, material's use, and goods' flow, so as to both enhance the power of resistance and lay the foundation for national construction. Our country is vast and populous, and the resources are abundant. The past shortcomings lie in the fact that power has not been mobilized, or that there have been attempts to mobilize but without concrete methods. In the future, we must respond to the needs of the times and strive for practical and effective methods, not indulge in empty talk, not pursue unrealistic goals, and in everything, we must have a broad perspective and start with small things, seek truth from facts, and achieve success. The ancients said that climbing high must start from low, and traveling far must start from near, which can be used as a guideline for our success in establishing our careers. The various proposals received by this production conference can grasp the core of the current various issues, are comprehensive and thoughtful, and are practical plans. The opinions expressed by the members are also mostly based on practical experience, with concise and clear explanations, and are concrete and unique contributions. After this conference, all domestic agricultural, mining, industrial, transportation, and economic production undertakings will have a more meticulous and progressive plan. If, after the closing of the conference, we can further refine and implement more effective methods based on these plans and adapt them to the actual situation in various departments and regions, and work hard to promote them, then the day the conference closes will be the time when new production is launched, and resistance and national construction will depend on it. Now, I will briefly state a few points that I have thought of for reference. First, no one should be wasted. The necessary conditions for production are labor, capital, and land. Our country is blessed with these three needs being fully supplied. The current problem is how to utilize these superior conditions so that nothing is wasted, and in terms of labor and technology, we should pay particular attention. Our country has the largest population in the world, and for thousands of years, it has been based on agriculture. In addition to farming and harvesting, the people in the countryside have plenty of leisure time. Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, the number of unemployed people has been increasing day by day. This large amount of surplus labor should be used in some way to engage in production work. However, observing the current situation, on the one hand, there are gatherings of idlers in society who have nothing to do all day long, and on the other hand, production agencies feel the lack of labor, resulting in high wages and high production costs. As a result, not only can the country's production capacity not be strengthened, but unemployed idlers, under the pressure of hunger and cold, have become bandits in large numbers, and social order has been adversely affected. This contradictory phenomenon must be remedied. The best way to remedy it is to absorb idlers into production undertakings, assigning them appropriate work according to their inclinations, talents, and skills. Those who can engage in agriculture, industry, and commerce will benefit the country. Even if they repair bridges and roads, remove dirt and filth, it is not without benefit to society. We must hope that everyone will pay attention to planning, make proper use of them, integrate relief into production, and apply education and training to production, so that things are done by the right people, and people are able to make the best use of their talents, and then we can develop land resources, exhaust material resources, and facilitate the flow of goods. Second, no resources should be wasted. Our country's production is backward, and resources have not been fully utilized. It is a fact that the development of existing materials is not sufficient to meet current needs. However, a 5,000-year-old ancient country, various production mechanisms and methods, whether inherited from the past or imitated in recent times, can be improved and used to enhance national power, and there will be many supplements. Not to mention the various farming methods in agricultural production, which are deeply in line with modern scientific principles, even the old household industries, handicrafts, etc., have skills that can be adopted and applied. In terms of transportation, if modern trains, ships, and automobiles cannot all be fully self-sufficient, then the original means of transportation, such as horse-drawn carriages, camel transport, and handcarts, should be used and improved. There are countless examples of this, as long as we pay attention to promoting them. Third, we must pay attention to economy. There are many proposals at this conference that involve the organization and structure of production agencies, which is also very important, because if the production agency is large and complex, then there will inevitably be waste in terms of manpower and expenses, which will not increase the original intention of production. This kind of situation often happens in our country. For example, the population census is not too difficult, but the agencies for investigating household registration in various places are spending a lot of money, employing many people, and spending years and months, they still cannot get accurate statistics. It is unlikely that there are dozens of similar production undertakings. In the future, we must avoid redundant expenses as much as possible to reduce production costs. Fourth, we must choose the right time. There are very few things that have permanent value. Most things are time-sensitive. Things that were useful in the past may not be useful now. Things that are needed now cannot wait until the future to be prepared. Production undertakings must be divided into urgent and slow, and they must adapt to the times, so as not to waste energy and time. At the present time of the war of resistance, all military and social demands and supplies must be met without delay. Therefore, we should select some of the most urgent undertakings and create them as soon as possible. Those that are not related to national defense, military affairs, and the necessities of people's lives can be postponed or suspended. This point is very important. During this conference, which lasted for a week, more than two or three hundred proposals were discussed. All members were able to complete their tasks in a tense atmosphere. The process and results of the conference were good. In the future, we can ensure that this result is developed and expanded, which depends on how we implement it. Most of you are the heads of various production agencies and those who are actually responsible. I hope that you will be aware of the importance of your duties, work hard to accomplish things, establish a foundation for your careers, and make the greatest contribution to the country."

It is expected that after six months, all guerrilla members will be able to read the daily newspapers published by the guerrilla headquarters. The political workers in these troops have recently compiled special textbooks and formulated unique educational methods for these special "students." (18th Reuters Electric Dispatch)

### Chinese and Foreign Reporters in Chongqing Interview Japanese Prisoners of War; Captain Ueda Writes Impressions

Chongqing: Chinese and foreign reporters from this city visited twenty prisoners of war from the × War Zone this afternoon. The prisoners of war were all wearing gray uniforms and sitting on the floor. After greeting the reporters, a medium-sized man stood up. Upon inquiry, he was identified as Captain Ueda Susumu, the captain of the Japanese transport unit, from Hiroshima City, 33 years old. Although Captain Ueda and the other twenty-one men belonged to different units, because of his higher rank and longer association with them, they all regarded him as their leader. He introduced to the reporters that some were infantry, some were artillery, and one, Mr. Takagaki Imasaru, a mechanic only 21 years old, was the most sincere. It is said that before enlisting, he was a worker at a certain engine assembly plant, earning a salary of 3 yuan and 33 cents a day. His parents are still alive, and he has no siblings. He was ordered to enlist by the factory owner, which is slightly different from ordinary soldiers. After being captured, he received preferential treatment from the Chinese side. Apart from gratitude, he had nothing to say. In addition, Mr. Morikawa Tatsumatsu and Mr. Takahashi Nagaichi, both 35 years old, belonged to the 104th Regiment of the 13th Division and were both from poor farming backgrounds. They spoke honestly. However, the most knowledgeable person was still Captain Ueda, who had recently written an essay titled "Impressions." The gist of it was that he was ordered to come to China, deceived by warlords, and only after arriving in China did he learn the actual situation, which was completely different from what the warlords had said. After being captured, he was treated with sympathy by Chinese officers, soldiers, and intellectuals, which made him feel extremely grateful and moved to tears. In the future, he sincerely wishes to contribute his talents to China to repay their kindness and to promote the early end of the war so that everyone can enjoy the joy of equality and happiness.

### Full Text of the U.S. Note to Japan

The U.S. government's reply to the Japanese government's request to amend the Shanghai International Settlement Land Regulations was telegraphed in summary by the Associated Press and published in yesterday's newspaper. The full text was announced yesterday by the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai. A special translation is provided below:

Regarding the memorandum of May 3rd from the Japanese Foreign Ministry official regarding the amendment of the Shanghai International Settlement Land Regulations and the alteration and improvement of the administrative structure of the International Settlement sent to the U.S. Ambassador in Tokyo. The memorandum concerns the date on which the Shanghai International Settlement Land Regulations currently in effect came into force, and states that the existing administrative structure is in many respects unsuitable to cope with the gradual evolution of the past seventy years and the severe changes in recent times. The U.S. government, as always, is prepared to engage in friendly and orderly negotiations, properly established and conducted, regarding any amendments needed to the Shanghai International Settlement Land Regulations. However, the U.S. government must state that, in the opinion of the U.S. government, the situation in the Shanghai area is currently far from normal, and there is no prospect of obtaining an orderly solution to the complex problems involved, or a basis for discussions that would afford all parties concerned reasonable and fair treatment. As for the issue of Chinese courts in the International Settlement, it must be stated that these courts were established in accordance with multilateral agreements to which the U.S. is a party, and their status was determined accordingly. Observations regarding possible amendments to the Land Regulations are often applied to these courts as well.

Regarding the existing electoral system of the Municipal Council and the public meetings within the International Settlement, it should be known that according to the Land Regulations, there is no discrimination against foreign taxpayers. The minimum requirement for voting eligibility is the payment of municipal rates based on an annual rental of five hundred taels of silver (equivalent to seven hundred yuan in legal tender). Under this system, the Japanese community enjoys a large and increasingly important voting right. In fact, the proportion of votes held by the Japanese, relative to the total number of votes, is much higher than the proportion of municipal rates and land taxes paid by the Japanese to the total amount of municipal rates and land taxes collected by the Municipal Council. Moreover, the Japanese have representatives participating in the Municipal Council Board of Directors and are employed in various departments of the Municipal Council.

As for the alteration and improvement of the administrative structure of the International Settlement, the U.S. government believes that the Japanese government will surely acknowledge that those involved in the administration of the International Settlement have often made adjustments throughout the settlement's history to cope with changing circumstances. The U.S. government trusts that the settlement authorities will continue to strive to adjust the administrative structure of the settlement, and its customs, to accommodate the fair and reasonable wishes of Japan and the Japanese people.

Regarding the claim in the Japanese memorandum that the settlement authorities should cooperate closely with the regimes that exist in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River with the aid of the Japanese army, it should be known that since there is no properly established and organized government in that area, the settlement authorities have always made various efforts to cope with the realities in the very difficult situation they face. The U.S. government feels that these authorities should expect various considerations from the Japanese civil and military authorities. Regarding this point, it should be pointed out that the International Settlement, from its very beginning, whenever disturbances have occurred in the surrounding areas, has made it its policy to avoid becoming involved in disputes arising from incidents outside the settlement boundaries. This avoidance is inherited from the international nature of the settlement, and from the natural promise inherent therein, namely, that no power enjoying benefits in the settlement, no matter how great its interests, should use developments originating elsewhere to discriminate against the international nature of the settlement.

The U.S. government is deeply impressed by the fact that the settlement authorities, even in the extremely difficult and tense atmosphere in Shanghai, have effectively and energetically minimized the disturbances and illegal activities that have occurred in the part of the International Settlement under their effective jurisdiction. The U.S. government reiterates the efforts made by the standing committee of the International Settlement in the past and continuing in the future to fulfill its normal duties. These efforts are often severely hampered and made more difficult by the illegal activities within the areas connected to the settlement, and by the Japanese army's refusal to return the area of the settlement north of the Suzhou Creek to the effective jurisdiction of the International Settlement authorities.

The U.S. government must inform the Japanese government that if the Japanese government were to frankly acknowledge the excellent work done by the settlement authorities in the past and at present, and immediately return to the settlement authorities full jurisdiction over the settlement area extended to the north of the Suzhou Creek, it would certainly improve the smooth operation of the settlement's administrative structure.

In summary, the U.S. government, in view of the fact that Shanghai is a center of great harmony that has been developed by the people of many nations for the mutual benefit of all, and that the International Settlement is a very important part of this development, believes that any issue that affects the status and welfare of the settlement inevitably involves many countries, including the U.S.

Regarding the amendment of the Land Regulations, the U.S. government, as stated above, believes that this is an issue that should await the development of a more stable situation. However, with regard to the administrative customs of the settlement, many adjustments have already been made to meet the needs of changing circumstances. The U.S. government believes that the settlement authorities are prepared to continue their best efforts to accommodate any reasonable requests aimed at continuing to make adjustments.

### Fierce Fighting in Yixing War, Japanese Planes Bomb the People Suffer

Yixing Correspondence: Yicheng is a vital transportation hub between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, surrounded by mountains, and is a strategically important location for military operations. Since the Chinese army attacked Yixing, they once broke into the city, but the Japanese army resisted fiercely. The Chinese army continues to advance bravely. At the same time, major battles are also taking place in Caoqiao, Heqiao, Qitingqiao, Qishangong, and Fenqiao. The Japanese side dispatched reinforcements from Suzhou and Wuxi, under the command of Sakamoto, and confronted the Chinese army on three fronts. The Chinese army then abandoned the frontal attack, using flanking tactics, dispersing and avoiding the Gaocheng Hongtatou area. The Japanese side then dispatched 14 bombers successively, carrying out indiscriminate bombing in Nanyuesi, Luliping, Hongtatou, Gaocheng, Hejiadu, and Nanxin Street, dropping 60-70 bombs, resulting in heavy casualties among innocent people, and houses were destroyed. The area is now scarred and there is no way to provide relief. The city is short of food, and the residents who had returned to the city have long since scattered. The Japanese army now wants to demolish the houses of the residents outside the city walls to remove obstacles. The Chinese army is still deeply entrenched in the mountains, waiting for an opportunity to attack.

### Japanese Army Forcibly Drafts Men for Combat

Taixian Correspondence: The Japanese army is now forcibly drafting able-bodied men in various guerrilla areas, training them, and sending them to the front lines in different provinces to fight. They are also inducing them to plunder and loot at will. According to a recent report from Yangzhou, the Japanese army stationed in various parts of northern Jiangsu has implemented the forced conscription of men. Therefore, the young people in the various guerrilla areas feel extremely resentful and have risen up to join the guerrilla forces or have moved to the countryside. The Japanese army, because of the active presence of Chinese patriotic elements, has specially gathered Chinese traitors to organize assassination groups, led by Peng Yuxin.

The Taixian Children's Brigade, in order to expand the children's organization and mobilize all the children in the county to participate in the war of resistance, held its first symposium on the afternoon of the 10th in the park hall, gathering children from various schools and private schools to discuss specific items: (1) The symposium should be held weekly. Resolved: to be held every Sunday afternoon at 2 pm in the park. (2) Publish the joint declaration of the children of the county. Resolved: The Children's Brigade is responsible for drafting and submitting it to the next meeting for approval. (3) Promote singing movements. Resolved: Each school and private school should organize singing teams, and the representatives of each school should be responsible for the preparation. The Propaganda Department of the puppet Jiangdu People's Congress is now preparing to organize a so-called "Peace Promotion Sports Meeting," with Shen Mingzhu and Jiang Taihua as the president and vice president, respectively. Shen also colluded with unscrupulous merchants to purchase 1,000 piculs of rice and 2,000 bags of flour to prepare for emergency needs because the Japanese army in Yangzhou was facing a food shortage.

### The Chinese Army Under Ren Once Captured the Town of Meili

Suzhou Correspondence: The Chinese army under Ren Dashi, active in the Changshu Dongxiang area, attacked the town of Meili, located at the junction of Suzhou and Changshu, on the 16th in two groups. The puppet army stationed in the town at the time resisted, but soon the puppet army collapsed, leaving behind many corpses. When the Chinese army occupied the town, the residents of the town brought wine and meat to reward the soldiers. Soon, Ren's troops searched the vicinity and captured the puppet township director Xu Gansheng and many puppet soldiers, and took them to a certain place. Ren's troops stayed in the town for one night, and the next morning led their troops elsewhere.

### Anti-Aggression Talks Stalled Russia Again Rejects British Proposal Insists on Concluding a Tripartite Military Alliance British Foreign Secretary to Paris Today for Negotiations

(London) Regarding the formation of an anti-aggression bloc, the new British counter-proposal advocates: (1) the Soviet Union should guarantee Romania and Poland, and provide assistance immediately upon being subjected to aggression; (2) If Romania and Poland are subjected to aggression, Britain will immediately discuss joint assistance measures with France and the Soviet Union; (3) The British, French, and Soviet Union will expand the scope of guarantees to include other countries; (4) Britain, France, and the Soviet Union will conduct political and military talks as soon as possible. It is reported that this new counter-proposal has been rejected by the Soviet Ambassador Maisky, and the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union have effectively reached a deadlock.

Soviet sources here recently stated that the Soviet Union's proposal is to conclude a mutual assistance treaty between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, supplemented by a military agreement, and any other suggestions will be rejected. People close to the British government said that this Soviet proposal was beyond Britain's imagination. Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax, and Chancellor of the Exchequer Hoare met today for several discussions. It is heard that they do not intend to make any further proposals. When the House of Commons discusses foreign policy tomorrow, Prime Minister Chamberlain will explain the difficulties in the current negotiations, but everything will indicate that anything that hinders the conclusion of an agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union should be avoided. Foreign observers here said that when the League of Nations Council meets in Geneva next week, the representatives of Britain and the Soviet Union may reach a compromise, with Britain accepting new binding obligations. However, the British government should consider the views of the Conservative Party and not enter into a formal alliance treaty with the Soviet Union. (Havas, 18th)

(London) This morning, Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky went to the Foreign Office for a short discussion with the government's foreign policy advisor, Sir Robert Vansittart. It is reported that he stated that his government still cannot accept the new counter-proposal put forward by Britain regarding the formation of an anti-aggression bloc, and insists that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must conclude an alliance treaty. Ambassador Maisky is scheduled to leave for Geneva tonight to attend the League of Nations Council meeting. Therefore, Britain and France will not continue negotiations before the Council meeting. According to well-informed sources here, the French government has indicated to the Soviet Union that since Britain has made efforts to bring its new counter-proposal closer to the Soviet Union's views, it is hoped that the Soviet government will pay attention to it. The previous negotiations are still deadlocked. It is hoped that after France's mediation, a compromise can be found to reconcile the views of both parties. (Havas, 19th)

(London) When the House of Commons met today, Prime Minister Chamberlain reported on the negotiations between Britain and Russia. His conclusion was, "Foreign Secretary Halifax is scheduled to go to Paris tomorrow to exchange views with French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet. It is believed that a practical way will be found to overcome the existing obstacles. I also firmly believe that we will formally announce to the House of Commons at the appropriate time that our country has formally concluded an agreement with the Soviet Union." (Havas, 19th)

### Lloyd George Advocates for a Quick Alliance with Soviet Russia

(London) During today's foreign policy debate in the House of Commons, Lloyd George spoke first, earnestly urging the government to conclude a "heartfelt alliance" with the Soviet Union, stating that the decisions made by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in the next few hours or in the next few days are far more important than any decisions made by the countries since 1914. When George began to speak, Soviet Ambassador Maisky entered the chamber and took his seat in the ambassador's gallery. George's speech was insightful and moving, focusing on the fears that the general public held about the attacks launched by dictatorial countries and asking the public to pay attention to the unprecedented preparations they had made. George said that the secrets obtained now are the same as those that existed in 1918, and their purpose is to intimidate us. The only way to turn hostility into friendship is to prepare the British army to deal with unforeseen events and to seek cooperation from countries that can resist aggression.

When George mentioned the Soviet Union, he said that several parties now want to avoid working with the Soviet Union. Britain has given guarantees to Poland and Romania, using this as a military proposal, without inviting the Soviet Union to join. I wonder what the House thinks about this? Why don't we quickly decide to advocate concluding a heartfelt alliance with the Soviet Union, with the same conditions as France, so as not to miss the opportunity?

George finally mentioned the dictatorial countries, saying, "We have already concluded friendship agreements with them (the audience laughed), we are now shaking their claws (the opposition cheered). At this moment, we are either participating in their celebration of bestial victory (the opposition cheered)."

Opposition leader Attlee then spoke, acknowledging that George had just described an extremely bleak but very realistic picture of the world situation. Attlee expressed dissatisfaction with the government's failure to make constructive efforts to seek peace, but only to wait in fear for the coming act of aggression, saying that we must recognize the Axis powers' policy of aggression, and that Europe now has an armed bandit, ready to demand of anyone, "Stand and deliver all you have."

### Chamberlain's Lengthy Speech Announces British Policy and Strategy

When Prime Minister Chamberlain rose to speak after Attlee, the audience cheered to show their respect. The Prime Minister said that he did not want to talk about foreign policy today, because this is a time of tension, anxiety, and suspicion. He knew that every word he said would not only enter the ears of the members of Parliament, but would also be transmitted to the world and studied under a magnifying glass. There are now some malicious people who are waiting for him to seize a piece of rhetoric uttered in a moment of excitement, and give it a meaning that the speaker never intended. Attlee has just said that the government should set a long-term peace policy, and that the colonial issue should be part of it. It should be known that we in Britain do not want to buy peace at the cost of concessions, because concessions will only lead to further demands. However, this does not mean that we refuse to discuss any method that can satisfy the reasonable wishes of other countries. Even if adjustments are made to the existing situation, it is not impossible. There are several issues that can be easily resolved simply by guaranteeing that they will be discussed in an atmosphere of goodwill. There are also many concessions that can be easily given, simply by confirming that these concessions will only be used for the purpose for which they are given, and not to incite military strategies to harm the freedom of others. We cannot gain anything by discussing the final peace terms until we have recognized or abandoned any aggressive plans imposed on the people of other countries and are satisfied. The German government has announced that it has no intention of aggression. However, the difficulty felt today is not only that the opposition party does not believe its words, but this situation is actually created by the German government itself (the audience cheered). If we can obtain this kind of recognition, if we can be sure that there is no aggressive intent in the relationship between Germany and other countries, or that the continued use of force is necessary, then I think we can retreat and declare what our intentions are, and what policies we should take in discussing permanent and half-way conditions. The greatest interest of our country lies in the maintenance of peace, and a solution that can take into account the needs, demands, and rights of other countries and ourselves is most beneficial to the interests of Britain. I believe that this is a kind of international spirit that I would like to discuss further on how we should propose a permanent peace strategy.

The Prime Minister recounted George's speech, saying that he believed that the seriousness of the situation should not be underestimated, but that George's remarks seemed too pessimistic. As for the rumors that Britain returned Czech assets to benefit Germany, they are completely unfounded. The Ministry of Finance does not allow any Czech assets to be returned to the part issued by the International Clearing Bank, but only provides a small amount of funds for refugees. The Prime Minister also mentioned the annexation of Bohemia and Moravia into Germany, saying that he did not know whether the German policy government itself recognized that this move would cause a huge reaction overseas. He believed that there was one thing that would make the public psychology feel even more deeply uneasy than the merger of this territory, that is, this kind of action is in direct contradiction with the solemn guarantees that the German policy government often gives to the world. Therefore, this contrary fact has completely shaken the sense of security and created a universal emotion in the world, that is, each small country that hinders Germany's ambitions will no longer be able to obtain security. It is our intention that, if we cannot put forward a certain new stabilizing factor, then the disintegration of a large part of Europe is imminent. The government believes that, in this kind of environment, it is responsible for joining with France to intervene and try to supply the above-mentioned stabilizing factors, and that because all parties are keenly aware of the fears of attack, it is necessary to act quickly.

The Prime Minister continued, "The guarantees we have given to Poland and Greece are not all the plans we have in mind. We may call this guarantee an emergency measure, but it is only to prevent the continued deterioration of the situation. There is still a need for more permanent measures to strengthen it and try to obtain assistance from other powerful or willing parties in other areas. I would like to explain that this policy is not motivated by hostility, but to make the European powers into a group of confrontations, and to accept war as an inevitable opinion. I do not recognize it as inevitable before the start of the war. The darker the situation, the more possible the outbreak of war, the more we should redouble our efforts to avoid it. We recognize that the policies of opposing groups are extremely unstable and therefore fundamentally dangerous. The policy we have adopted does not contain any aggressive elements, nor does it exclude the possibility of discussing all the opinions of all countries in a friendly spirit. This is indeed a policy of defense, which can only be used under certain conditions. The establishment of this state and our existence depend on the strength of others. This is a guarantee of resistance to armed aggression. We hope that this aggression will never occur. This policy seems to be necessary, because otherwise, there will never be a prospect of establishing a stable concept in Europe. Without this policy, trade and enterprise will come to a standstill, and the state of people's lives cannot be improved."

The Prime Minister continued, "Things are changing rapidly, and it is impossible to conclude an agreement in an instant. Therefore, I believe that the position of Britain and Turkey in the event of a war caused by aggression in the Mediterranean region should be clearly expressed to the world. We have declared that, in the event of an incident, we are willing to help each other and work together. However, the content of this declaration is not limited to the Mediterranean, because it recognizes the need to establish security in the Balkans. We have obtained a compromise on all the matters discussed, and there is no doubt that the results of the English and Turkish two countries will proceed to conclude a long-term article."

The Prime Minister finally mentioned the huge impression created by the above guarantees, and said, "We are doing our best in the country, which is not enough to fulfill the guarantees we have given, so we are eager to seek the participation of other countries to assist. This is why we are talking with Turkey and the Soviet Union. Our discussion with Turkey quickly revealed the common interests and forward-looking views of the two countries, so the two governments were able to issue a declaration on May 12. This declaration has received an extremely warm welcome. The satisfaction expressed by the general public can be seen as a sign of the high prestige of Turkey and the preciousness of its friendship. The Prime Minister expressed his warm admiration to Turkey and said that the friendship between Britain and Turkey began when Kemal was President, and has continued to strengthen after the current President took office.

The Prime Minister also recounted the discussion between Britain and the Soviet Union, saying that he could not help but feel that there was a slight misunderstanding. I now want to reiterate it, and if we can find a way to obtain the cooperation and assistance of the Soviet Union to establish a peace front, we will naturally be welcome, because we need and value it. We despise the Soviet Union's ability to be a Deputy Director of the Construction Project of the Siberian Heilongjiang Railway, recently published a statement to the press, elaborating on the status of the largest construction project of the third five-year plan. It is said that the area through which this railway passes is rich in gold, tin, coal, and other useful minerals, and the forests in some areas are endless. The construction of this railway will enhance the connection between the Far East and Siberia, and will have a decisive significance for the development of industry in the Far East and along the line. At present, the construction project is in full swing, and the vast work of blasting mountains and building roads has been carried out in all sections. The mountain rocks blasted at one time often reach more than 100,000 cubic meters. The line passes through more than 3,000 large and small rivers, including the Lena River, Angara River, Saiya River, and Heilongjiang. All the bridges on the line, if connected into one, can pass from France to England. The area where the line's construction project is underway is now being developed for settlement and land reclamation. The land has been surveyed, and the future collective farm village houses have also been started. Several villages have been completed, and their collective farms have been distributed land, livestock, and agricultural implements for permanent use. Not long ago, places that were inaccessible to humans will now be prosperous collective agricultural areas. The time for the completion of each section of the line has long been stipulated by the government separately. Most of the money for the whole line will be able to start operating next year. From then on, the roar of the locomotive will break the silence of the forest, and the passion and perseverance of people will create an amazing transportation artery between the ice and snow.

### Churchill Expresses Surprise

(London) After Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons, Churchill, the leader of the far-right wing of the Conservative Party, expressed surprise at the difficulties in the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union. If Britain, France, and the Soviet Union conclude an alliance treaty, they can invite other countries to sign and join it. He expressed his satisfaction with the fact that Britain and Turkey had agreed on a mutual assistance agreement, and said that since the British and the Soviet Union had concluded an alliance treaty, Poland and the Baltic countries would not object, and Spain and Portugal might not approve. The conclusion of a strong alliance treaty by all peace-loving countries is also a good way to persuade Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to part ways with his partners. Finally, Foreign Office Secretary Butler delivered a speech, representing the government to conclude the debate, stating briefly that the British and both countries were still continuing negotiations, and the government was studying the views of the Soviet Union with sympathy. In addition, the government does not intend to recognize Germany's annexation of the two provinces of Bohemia and Moravia. (Havas, 19th) The opinions and the direction we should take in discussing permanent peace conditions, the greatest benefit to our country lies in the maintenance of peace, a solution that can pay attention to the needs and demands of other countries and ourselves, is most beneficial to the interests of Britain, I believe this is a kind of international spirit that he is willing to discuss further on how we should propose a permanent peace strategy.

The Prime Minister's father stated that the seriousness of the current situation should not be underestimated, but that George's remarks seemed too pessimistic. As for the rumors that Britain returned Czech assets to benefit Germany, they are completely unfounded. The Ministry of Finance does not allow any Czech assets to be returned to the part issued by the International Clearing Bank, but only provides a small amount of funds for refugees. The Prime Minister also mentioned the merger of Bohemia and Moravia into Germany, saying that he did not know whether the German policy government itself recognized that this move would cause a huge reaction overseas. He believed that there was one thing that would make the public psychology feel even more deeply uneasy than the merger of this territory, that is, this kind of action is in direct contradiction with the solemn guarantees that the German policy government often gives to the world. Therefore, this contrary fact has completely shaken the sense of security and created a universal emotion in the world, that is, each small country that hinders Germany's ambitions will no longer be able to obtain security. It is our intention that, if we cannot put forward a certain new stabilizing factor, then the disintegration of a large part of Europe is imminent. The government believes that, in this kind of environment, it is responsible for joining with France to intervene and try to supply the above-mentioned stabilizing factors, and that because all parties are keenly aware of the fears of attack, it is necessary to act quickly.

The first successor said that the guarantees we have given to Poland and Greece are not all the plans in our minds, we may call this guarantee a way to save the emergency, but it is only to prevent the continued deterioration of the situation, and we still need a more permanent way to strengthen it, and try to obtain it from other powerful or willing assistance, to obtain this other assistance, he is willing to explain that this policy is not motivated by hostility, but to make the European powers into a group of confrontations, and to accept war as an inevitable opinion, he does not recognize it as inevitable before the war begins, The darker the situation, the more possible the outbreak of war, the more we should redouble our efforts to avoid it. We recognize that the career of opposing groups is extremely unstable, so it is fundamentally very dangerous. The policy we have adopted does not contain any aggressive elements, nor does it exclude the possibility of discussing all the opinions of all countries in a friendly spirit. This is indeed a policy of defense, which can only be used under certain conditions. The establishment of this state and us depend on the strength of others, and this is a guarantee of resistance to armed aggression. We hope that this aggression will never occur. This policy seems to be necessary, because otherwise, there will never be a boom in establishing a stable concept in Europe. Without this policy, trade and enterprise will fall into stagnation, and the state of people's lives cannot be improved.

The Prime Minister continued, "The world is changing rapidly, and it is impossible to conclude an agreement in an instant. Therefore, I believe that the position of Britain and Turkey in the event of a war caused by aggression in the Mediterranean region should be clearly expressed to the world. We have declared that, in the event of an incident, we are willing to help each other and work together. However, the content of this declaration is not limited to the Mediterranean, because it recognizes the need to establish security in the Balkans. We have obtained a compromise on all the matters discussed, and there is no doubt that the results of the English and Turkish two countries will proceed to conclude a long-term article."

The Prime Minister finally mentioned the huge impression created by the above guarantees, and said, "We are doing our best in the country, which is not enough to fulfill the guarantees we have given, so we are eager to seek the participation of other countries to assist. This is why we are talking with Turkey and the Soviet Union.

The Prime Minister also recounted the discussion between Britain and the Soviet Union, saying that he could not help but feel that there was a slight misunderstanding. Since the Soviet Union had previously stated that it was not, I now want to reiterate that if we can find a way to obtain the cooperation and assistance of the Soviet Union to establish a peace front, we will naturally be welcome, because we need and value it. We despise the Soviet Union's ability to be a Deputy Director of the Construction Project of the Siberian Heilongjiang Railway, recently published a statement to the press, elaborating on the status of the largest construction project of the third five-year plan.

### Ten Thousand Spanish Troops Enter Madrid; German and Italian Troops Also Participate; Will Withdraw to Their Countries Soon

Madrid – General Franco formally entered Madrid today, reviewing 100,000 victorious troops, including 10,000 Italian soldiers and 4,000 German soldiers. After the parade, the Italian and German troops will be transferred back to their respective countries. (Reuter, 19th)

Madrid – Spanish Commander-in-Chief General Franco entered Madrid in a motorcade at 9 a.m. this morning, driving directly to the reviewing stand. He was accompanied by various commanders and senior government officials. Representatives of the diplomatic corps attending the ceremony included the German Ambassador Stohrer and the Italian Ambassador Viola. The grand military review began at 9 a.m. sharp. (Haitong Telegraph, 19th)

Spanish Commander-in-Chief Franco

Madrid – The Nationalist Army began its triumphal entry into the city at 9:10 a.m. today. Commander-in-Chief General Franco, cabinet members, and military leaders all participated in the grand event. Except for the Minister of Justice, Rodriguez, all cabinet members wore military uniforms. Along the parade route, stands were erected on both sides, all filled to capacity. (Havas, 19th)

Madrid – The Spanish Nationalist Army began its triumphal entry into the city at 9 a.m. this morning. The participating troops were led by German "Condor Legion" soldiers, followed by the Italian Army's "Black Arrow" Division, then the four divisions of the Spanish headquarters from the central, southern, northern, and western regions, followed by the wireless team, propaganda team, cavalry team, tank team, anti-tank artillery team, anti-aircraft artillery team, mechanized artillery team, and searchlight team. In addition, several squadrons of new-style fighter planes soared overhead. As each unit passed in front of Commander-in-Chief General Franco, they shouted "Long live Spain." (Havas, 19th)

### The King and Queen of England Arrive in Ottawa

Ottawa – The King and Queen of England arrived here today and were warmly welcomed by the people. (Reuter, 19th)

Montreal – The King and Queen of England arrived here at 7:14 p.m. yesterday. The streets were filled with flags and bunting, and an estimated 1.2 million people stood along the route to welcome them. The cheers were deafening. The welcoming ceremony was the same as in Quebec. The King and Queen traveled 24 miles in an open car. When passing through the French countryside, they entered the Montreal Stadium, circling it once. 85,000 children who spoke French in the stadium cheered. The King and Queen signed the city's "Golden Book" and then arrived at Molson Stadium, where they were welcomed by 15,000 children who spoke English. Along the way, a group of Red Indian people paid their respects to the royal carriage with their ancient marching calls. Shortly after, a grand welcoming banquet was held at Windsor Residence, with speeches in Old French Canadian. When the royal train traveled from Quebec to Montreal, it briefly stopped at Trois-Rivières station along the way. The mayor and city councilors of the area, along with their families, waited at the station to welcome them. Another 75,000 factory workers and students gathered around the station, cheering from afar. (Reuter, 18th)

### Relations Between Northern European Countries and Germany; Germany Announces the Progress of Negotiations

(Berlin) – The official announcement stated that after Führer Hitler delivered a speech in the Reichstag on April 28, declaring his willingness to sign non-aggression pacts with certain European countries, the German government conducted separate negotiations with Estonia, Latvia, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Finland. As of now, the results can be summarized in three points: (1) The non-aggression pacts negotiated between Germany and Estonia and Latvia are nearing completion. (2) The agreement between Germany and Denmark has been agreed upon in principle and will be signed as soon as possible. (3) Norway, Sweden, and Finland have all stated that they do not feel threatened by Germany and are determined to maintain neutrality, independence, and territorial integrity, and do not intend to sign non-aggression pacts with any country, including Germany, as they are unnecessary. Foreign observers here have commented on this matter, saying that Lithuania signed an agreement with Germany in March, containing non-aggression clauses. The announcement issued by the German government today did not mention the country at all, which is noteworthy. In addition, Führer Hitler said in his speech to the Reichstag that Germany was willing to guarantee the security of any country that wished to be protected by Germany. Therefore, the proposal to conclude non-aggression pacts originated from Germany and did not wait for the initiation of other countries. (Havas, 18th)

### Arab Countries Oppose the British White Paper; Jews Clash with British Authorities; The Palestine Problem is Very Thorny

Cairo – The Egyptian government today sent a note to the British government, stating that it could not persuade the Palestinians to accept the White Paper. Egypt, the Kingdom of Hejaz, and Iraq do not approve of the British plan. The Arabic newspaper Al-Balagh stated that this British policy lacks wisdom and its ultimate goal is clearly to colonize Palestine with Jews. We hope that the Palestinians can obtain the support of the English who have freedom of thought. (Reuter, 18th)

Capital of Iraq – Regarding the Palestine issue, after the British government issued the White Paper, the Iraqi government submitted a memorandum to the British government, expressing its opposition. It was very lengthy. (Havas, 19th)

Jerusalem – Regarding the Palestine issue, the White Paper issued by the British government yesterday has aroused strong reactions from the Jewish community. The Arab community has also expressed dissatisfaction. The Supreme Committee of the Arab community held an emergency meeting tonight to discuss it and issued a communiqué after the meeting, announcing its rejection of the British government's proposal. The reason given was that the content of the White Paper was no different from the opinions previously put forward by the British government during the London Round Table Conference. At that time, the Arab representatives strongly rejected it because it did not meet their demands and it is not appropriate to accept it now. (Havas, 18th)

Jerusalem – Yesterday, thousands of Jews gathered to demonstrate. At first, they were orderly, but due to the instigation of radicals and the support of young troublemakers, they tried to rush into the local government office, but were blocked by the police. The British police were attacked by demonstrators throwing bricks and remained calm for several hours. When two policemen were injured by rioters, they charged into the crowd. One British policeman died and twelve were injured, and one hundred Jews were injured. The authorities turned off the lights, and the road was as black as pitch, and the rioters dispersed. Order gradually recovered, and armed vehicles patrolled the streets. The Jews have now resumed work, and the shops are open. During the disturbance last night, a post office branch was set on fire by the crowd, and a British department store and a German café were destroyed by rioters. (Reuter, 19th)

### Regarding Chamberlain's Speech

The claim of giving aid is completely unfounded. The House may recall Mr. Stalin's recent remarks that the policy of the Soviet Union is to aid countries that are invaded and willing to defend their independence. This is in line with our opinion. This statement seems to indicate that the Soviet Union may be willing to cooperate, and to make this happen, we also know that this point has not been taken seriously so far. Therefore, the direct participation of the Soviet Union may not fully meet the wishes of other countries that are making this arrangement for them. We want the cooperation of all countries, and we do not want any divisions among the countries. Therefore, we suggested to the Soviet Union that they issue a declaration to Poland and Romania that is the same as that of Britain and France. The Soviet Union obviously believes that this kind of provision is not of a mutual nature. What I want to tell the House now is that the British government has never wanted to ask the Soviet Union to do things that we ourselves are unwilling to do (cheers from the crowd). The British government has always wanted all arrangements to be mutual. What is now incomprehensible is why our proposal is considered to lack reciprocity. This proposal may be considered not to include certain countries outside the Baltic states, because they are neighbors of the Soviet Union, or someone may attack the Soviet Union through their borders. In fact, this is not the case. This proposal is not applied equally to several Western European countries. If these countries are attacked, we will definitely join the war. His intention above is sufficient to show that our proposal did not consider that the Soviet Union should intervene regardless of whether Britain and France are involved in the war. However, the guarantee we issued has therefore assumed obligations regardless of whether the Soviet Union joins us. This is a clear fact. Therefore, if there is any inequality between the two parties, this inequality actually benefits the Soviet Union, not Britain. Now the Soviet Union obviously has some misunderstandings, but no matter what comments criticize our proposal, he dares to say that it cannot be described as unfair. However, since the proposal was rejected by the Soviet Union, we have once again made special efforts. We sincerely want to quickly reach a compromise with each other. Now, please remember that what we are trying to do in this special article is not only to form alliances between Britain and other countries, but also to resist aggression and build a peace front. If the cooperation of one country is guaranteed, and another country is made uneasy by it, and is unwilling to cooperate with us, then our policy cannot succeed. This matter contains huge difficulties and subtleties, and must be handled with caution. This is not due to differences in doctrine, nor is it due to pure stubbornness, but entirely because the purpose of our policy is to create this kind of peace front. I would rather delay for a few days than act rashly, so that the work that has already been carried out will be shattered before our eyes. We believe that the Soviet Union may be willing to announce that they agree with the events that we can agree with, and prepare to continue to discuss the issues on which we have different opinions at length. We believe that this is an enlightened approach, but the Soviet Union's decision not to allow Potemkin to attend the Geneva conference in person is regrettable. The Council of the League of Nations postponed the meeting for a week because Mr. Bo could not arrive immediately. Now that it has been postponed for a week, he still cannot come, which has caused Foreign Minister Halifax to lose the opportunity to discuss issues that are beneficial to both parties with Mr. Bo in person. The Soviet Union must have its own sufficient reasons for adopting this attitude. He can't help but feel that there is a curtain or wall separating the two governments, which is extremely difficult to break through. The Prime Minister continued, we have had close contact with France in the course of the above events. There is no disagreement between Britain and France. Foreign Minister Halifax will have the opportunity to continue discussions with French Prime Minister Daladier and French Foreign Minister Bonnet tomorrow. He believes that after this discussion, it may be possible to discover ways to overcome the obstacles that prevent Britain and the Soviet Union from reaching a compromise. (Reuter, 19th)

### Serious Alert in Both Concessions for the First Time in Months; Curbing Political Agitation and Crime; Garrison Troops and Detectives Fully Mobilized Yesterday; Searching Pedestrians and Residents, the Situation is Serious

The authorities of the two concessions in this city suddenly took various necessary precautions from late at night the day before yesterday. All roads and alleys at the boundaries of the two concessions were sealed off, with only ten places such as Yuqiaqing Road accessible. British and American garrison troops and White Russian mercenaries were deployed to patrol and search pedestrians. The French Navy increased its defense in the Xujiahui Tushanwan Church area of the French Concession, and the alert was extremely tight. The French Police Department also dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to conduct searches of residents in various areas and alleys, and the situation was particularly tense. The details of the investigation are as follows:

Important Reasons for the Concession Alert

The English-language Ta Mei Evening News reported that a certain Chang of the Public Works Bureau told reporters this morning (the 19th) that Shanghai cannot become an arena for political agitators or armed bandits. The sooner this is understood, the better. This is the reason for the alert by the military police and volunteers of the Public Concession and the French Concession today. (Since the two concessions were tightly guarded, rumors have spread everywhere. Seeing this news now, it should be reassuring.)

Meticulous Planning for Several Days

The Public Works Bureau's engineering team set up barbed wire barriers at several road entrances from the Public Concession to Edward Road at night. At 5:00 in the morning, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps received orders to prepare for deployment, and armored vehicles patrolled the roads during lunchtime. Concession police searched extensively throughout the day. French troops patrolled the roads of the French Concession, and American Marines and British soldiers patrolled the roads of the Public Concession. The meticulous planning of the two concessions had been going on for three or four days. Although they remained silent, there were slight leaks, which led to alarming rumors. It was not until last night that they decided to implement the plan.

Signs of Political Disturbances Appear

When citizens went out in the morning, they were surprised to see barbed wire fences placed at the entrances of various roads and armed soldiers patrolling the roads. A police officer said that the plan was a "practice alert" and could be implemented at any time. There have been signs of political disturbances recently, so the military police are working hard to curb them. If everyone is determined to be a good citizen, the public will not be inconvenienced by the measures taken now. The Public Works Bureau teams began setting up barbed wire fences on various roads from midnight. At road entrances designated for traffic, movable barriers were erected, but police teams were stationed there to carry out searches. In order to quickly set up barriers, the Public Works Bureau used circular rather than rectangular barbed wire nets in many places, as they were easier to transport.

Multiple Arrests Result from Searches

Police teams searched pedestrians and people in vehicles at various key points. As for the "badlands" area in western Shanghai, strong police teams also searched pedestrians at various road entrances in the Public Concession. As of the time of writing today, the official announcement of the number of people arrested has not yet been obtained. However, it is believed that several suspects have been arrested and several pistols have been seized. Since 6:00 in the morning, the French Concession has been searching residences in various districts and is expected to continue searching throughout the day. Members of the French Volunteer Corps also mobilized this morning, driving many of the light armored vehicles used by the police department. Special police officers of the French Concession are prepared to stand by and are expected to mobilize tonight to replace the regular police teams.

Sealing Off at Various Intersections

Since Japanese troops landed on Gulangyu Island, the situation in the two concessions in this city suddenly became tense. However, after the solemn expression of Britain and the United States, it has recently eased. However, starting at 0:30 a.m. yesterday, the Public Concession authorities suddenly deployed barbed wire fences to all roads and alleys intersecting with the Inner Concession along Edward Road and Avenue Foch, implemented a blockade, and took necessary precautions. Yesterday morning, traffic on various roads was mostly blocked, and only ten places such as the Bund, Sichuan Road, Henan Road, Zhejiang Road, Yuqiaqing Road, Tongfu Road, Maho Road, Weihaiwei Road, Seymour Road, and Haig Road were accessible. However, additional Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to station at each road entrance to search all vehicles and pedestrians entering the Public Concession from the French Concession. The situation was similar to the "August 13th" Shanghai War Memorial Day last year. In addition, along the Suzhou Creek, except for the Old Rubbish Bridge, which was only guarded by detectives, the other bridges were also equipped with barbed wire fences, leaving only passages to allow pedestrians to enter and exit.

Garrison Troops and Detectives Mobilized for Patrols

British and American garrison troops stationed in Shanghai, White Russian mercenaries, and Chinese and Western detectives from the police station were all mobilized yesterday. British troops were responsible for guarding the area from the Bund to Yuqiaqing Road. White Russian mercenaries also rode in armored vehicles to patrol various roads. In the western Shanghai area near the extra-mural road construction section, American garrison troops sent troops to defend, carrying machine guns and automatic rifles, patrolling back and forth, with extremely tight security. At the same time, various police stations dispatched a large number of detectives to station at various important road entrances to search pedestrians.

French Navy Increases Defense of Tushanwan

During the westward retreat of the National Revolutionary Army, the Tushanwan Catholic Church area on Xujiahui Road in western Shanghai was approved by the National Government and the Municipal Government to be included in the jurisdiction of the French Concession. Recently, the Japanese side protested to the French authorities, requesting the return of the area. However, it has been strongly rejected by the French authorities. In order to prevent unforeseen circumstances, the French garrison authorities specially dispatched 200 French naval soldiers to the area yesterday morning to reinforce the defense. At the same time, the French police station also dispatched more than 70 Chinese, French, Vietnamese, and Russian detectives to assist in the defense, with extremely tight security. Chinese and Western detectives from the French police station searched shops and residences door-to-door in Xiaoyou Lane, Haige Lane, the old street of Xujiahui Town, Haige Road, and Hongqiao Road. At the same time, the French Navy's Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai and the armored vehicle team patrolled back and forth and checked pedestrians and vehicles. The defense at the Tushanwan Catholic Church and the blockade line at Hongqiao Road was very strict, with temporary additional double posts and barbed wire fences surrounding the area.

French Concession Searches Residences

The French Police Department issued orders to all police officers in all districts of the French Concession yesterday morning to mobilize and go to various roads and alleys to search shops and residences. Starting from the Bund of the French Concession, along Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Joffre, Avenue Foch, and all the way to Avenue Albert, the residents of the roads and alleys were searched separately, and the names and occupations of the residents were questioned. The HSBC Building in Zhonghui at the Big Ben Tower was also searched around 3:00 p.m. yesterday, but nothing was found. In addition, the armored vehicle team, the machine vehicle patrol team, and the French Navy Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai were also ordered to mobilize and patrol the streets, searching pedestrians passing by.

Shanghai Volunteer Corps Fully Prepared

The Chinese and foreign police officers in the police stations of the Public Concession's Public Works Bureau are now not allowed to take leave and are stationed in the police stations at all times for dispatch. The volunteer special police officers have also been assembled. As for the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the B Company of the White Russian mercenaries, with more than 300 people, is the one that is usually mobilized. However, at 7:00 a.m. yesterday, the Commander-in-Chief of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, Henry B. Peake, issued a preparatory order. The A Company of the cavalry team (i.e., the English team, the Scottish team, the Jewish team, the anti-aircraft team, etc.), the B Company (i.e., the American team, the Philippine team, the American machine gun team, etc.), and about 2,000 members of the various national teams were ordered to prepare for mobilization. When they receive the mobilization order, they must assemble within five minutes to await dispatch.

Various Measures to Maintain Public Security

Since the authorities of the two concessions took emergency precautions yesterday, the situation in this city, which had already eased, suddenly became tense again. Most citizens are speculating about it. However, according to the reporter's investigation with the relevant parties, the measures taken by the two concessions yesterday were entirely to maintain good order within the concession and protect the residents' peace and tranquility. There were no special events to cause alarm. Also, there was no change in curfew hours yesterday evening. The public believes that unless the situation requires it, the alert will not be advanced. However, the police department will intensify the alert in the evening.

### While the Situation in the Concession is Tense, the Japanese Consul Returns to Shanghai as Scheduled; Japanese Newspapers Describe Japanese Intentions; There is Still a Possibility of Further Occupation of the Concession

The Continental News reported that the Japanese-language Continental News stated last night (the 18th) that after Japanese Consul General Miura returns to Shanghai on May 27 after meeting with Japanese government leaders in Tokyo today, Japan's policy on the Public Concession issue is likely to undergo new developments. The attitude of the authorities here towards the Public Concession has recently reached the "final stage." Tokyo government officials have also decided on

Basic Policies

Accordingly, "thoroughly reform the situation in the Public Concession to adapt to the new situation." Miura is currently meeting with officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the events in the Public Concession and other issues in Central China and will return to Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru. When spokespersons for the Japanese Army and Navy met with reporters from various newspapers yesterday, they claimed that if

Major Events

The Japanese military will occupy the Public Concession if an event occurs in the Public Concession that conflicts with Japanese interests. He also stated that a "major event" would trigger a large military action across the Suzhou Creek bridges into the southern bank. According to reports, the spokesperson made these remarks in response to reporters' inquiries about disputes arising in casinos in this city. He also said that the Japanese Army and Navy have decided that the only way to treat Chinese patriotism is to govern the Public Concession or the French Concession, just like the

Rule of Hongkou

However, the spokesperson also said that if a major event occurs, it is not impossible for the Japanese military to be forced to enter the Public Concession. The interpreter added that the Navy spokesperson had already expressed this situation two weeks ago. The Army spokesperson's opinion is now the same as theirs. The Japanese Ambassador's spokesperson said that the return of Hongkou and Yangshupu to the jurisdiction of the Public Concession authorities "will be very slow." The Public Works Bureau is

Resuming Management

There are many obstacles to the northern district of Suzhou Creek. One of the Japanese goals is to "maintain peace and order." When asked if there was no peace and order before August 1937, the spokesperson replied that before the war in 1937, many Japanese soldiers were assassinated in Hongkou, so it cannot be said that there was peace and order in that area. The spokesperson made these remarks because Washington announced its rejection of the Japanese side's request to amend the Shanghai Public Concession

Land Regulations

So that the Public Works Bureau would approve the request to add Japanese representatives. Yesterday, Sir Marshall, Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, also stated that I believe that the explanation of the American rejection of the Japanese request to amend the Land Regulations is a very fair comment on the situation here. Unless the entire Public Concession is returned to unified management, normalcy cannot be restored.

### American Ship Arrives in Shanghai This Morning

The English-language Ta Mei Evening News reported that the U.S. Asiatic Fleet submarine tender USS Canopus and submarine S-38 sailed to Shanghai from Manila and will arrive in port at 6:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 20th) and will dock at the Huangpu River buoy. In addition, the U.S. ship Asheville is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 10:30 a.m. today and sail to South China.

### The Detained Five Chinese Have Not Been Released

Regarding the case of the five Chinese being detained, the Japanese spokesperson claimed that they had been released. The reporter conducted a detailed investigation, and the five Chinese have not yet returned home and are still being detained in Hongkou. The so-called release is highly questionable.

### The Meat Industry Resumes Operations This Morning; Meat Prices in the Market Have Stabilized; Merchants Are Making Every Effort to Circulate Sources

The fresh pork industry accepted the advice of the concession authorities and resumed operations yesterday, first selling existing pigs. However, they still adhered to their original position and refused to participate in any illegal organizations. The French Concession Slaughterhouse and the Public Concession's Xinninghai and Suxi Slaughterhouses resumed slaughtering pigs last night. Fresh meat merchants throughout the city will resume selling meat from today. Yesterday, meat prices in the meat market stabilized due to the resumption of operations in the fresh pork industry. The industry discounted the price to 12 taels per yuan. The price of leg meat sold at the door was 3 taels per yuan, and streaky pork was 5 taels per yuan. As for the pigs shipped to Shanghai on Japanese, German, and Italian ships in recent days, there were one or two thousand heads. Fortunately, they were detained by the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou. It is reported that merchants are making every effort to unblock the sources in order to maintain the food problem for the people of the two concessions and are determined not to be obstructed by anyone and continue to accept and transport the pigs.

### Rice Market in Extreme Chaos; Authorities Urgently Need to Thoroughly Investigate; Price Limits Cannot Be Enforced; Wuhu Rice Indeed Has Been Decontrolled

Due to speculation and manipulation by hoarders in the Shanghai soybean and rice market, rice prices have soared beyond the price limits. The Management Committee is unable to enforce restrictions, resulting in a serious situation. Rice prices have skyrocketed, and the price limits exist in name only. Yesterday, the situation was reported to the Soybean and Rice Trade Association to seek solutions. Now Wuhu has lifted the ban, and rice merchants are ordering foreign rice, so the entire food supply for the population can be temporarily assured. Details are recorded below:

Price Limits Fail; Market in Chaos

After the Soybean and Rice Trade Association issued decrees with penalties, strictly enforcing price limits and cracking down on black market transactions, the price of top-grade white rice has risen to over seventeen yuan due to speculation and manipulation by hoarders. The prices of all grades of rice exceed the limits. All 105 firms are treating black market transactions as formal business, making it impossible for the Market Management Committee to enforce penalties. The market chaos is unprecedented, creating the most serious problem. However, the daily transaction volume has increased from several thousand bags to over ten thousand bags.

Black Market Reports Cannot Be Suppressed

The chairman of the Market Management Committee, Fu Qian'geng, received a threatening letter the day before yesterday, roughly stating: "The cost of rice is high, and shipping rice to Shanghai is affected by the price limits, resulting in significant losses. If you dare to continue strictly enforcing price limits, we will not be able to operate. Therefore, we hope you will abandon the policy as soon as possible, or we will resort to severe measures." As a result, the Market Committee immediately convened a meeting and reported the situation to the Soybean and Rice Trade Association, requesting a quick and proper solution to maintain the food supply for the people of Shanghai.

Admonishing Rice Merchants is the Best Policy

Respected Sirs, we have received your letter stating that the over-limit black market transactions are caused by the sellers raising prices, which is improper, but the buyers bidding high prices are equally at fault. Please admonish the rice merchants not to bid high prices, and hope that all rice merchants will report such actions, etc. We have received and understood. It is clear that over-limit black market transactions are becoming more intense and can no longer be concealed. Why wait to report? Yesterday, the market price called out was 17.70 yuan. To get to the root of the matter, the sellers take the initiative, and the buyers listen to the market prices. If the sellers do not call out prices exceeding the limits, then the buyers will never bid high prices and sell at a loss in the store. Under the current situation, the most effective way to clarify the black market transactions is to ask your association to strictly admonish all rice merchants not to raise prices beyond the limits, so that price limits can be maintained and black market transactions can be completely eliminated. Regarding your request to admonish all rice merchants not to bid high prices, our association believes this is a major issue. Rice merchants directly supply the food for the entire city. If this results in a shortage of rice for sale, causing panic and affecting public order, and your association can take full responsibility, then our association will follow your instructions and notify all rice merchants to absolutely not buy beyond the limits. Otherwise, it would be merely a superficial gesture that does not help the situation. This is a special reply. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Trade Association, from the Shanghai Rice Merchant Association.

Rice Merchant Association Clarifies the Truth

Respected Sirs, after reading the letter from your association to our association in the newspaper, we were extremely surprised. Therefore, we have a few words we would like to tell your association, hoping you will consider them. Our industry is in direct contact with consumers and sells goods. We must have goods before we can supply the market. We cannot buy today what we need today, or buy tomorrow what we need tomorrow. This is a well-known fact. Moreover, there are many varieties of rice, and it is difficult to decide what to buy. A large supply of one variety may have limited demand, while a small supply of another may be in great demand. No rice merchant can avoid replenishing their stock for ten days. This is also well-known to your association. Currently, in the rice market, hoarders are competing to raise prices. For half a month, prices have exceeded the limits. Yet you want our merchants to strictly comply with the price limits for sales and not buy rice at all. This is unreasonable and factually impossible. Instead of trying to stop the hoarders' manipulation and monopoly (many of your association members are hoarders), you blame our members for not being able to refuse to buy, so that sellers cannot exceed the limits even if they want to. If our industry complies with your letter and refuses to buy, and then our stores run out of rice, causing great panic among the citizens, would your association be able to take full responsibility? Moreover, the sellers raise prices and the hoarders release prices, and all the power is in the hands of your members. How can our industry interfere? If your members had not vigorously absorbed and hoarded rice with the hoarders, rice prices would not have reached today's high. You are clear about blaming others but ignorant about blaming yourselves. Your association should ask yourselves if you are not ashamed of the four million citizens of the isolated island. Furthermore, since the outbreak of the war, Shanghai has experienced several rice shortages. If the authorities in the two concessions had not made every effort to maintain the supply, how could we have overcome these difficulties? Last year, there was a bumper harvest, and the supply to this city was abundant, causing rice prices to fall back to normal. At that time, we could have stored rice to prepare for future needs, to avoid another rice shortage like before. However, you did not do this because your leaders are also engaged in re-exporting. Taking advantage of the low rice prices, you re-exported large quantities and set the price limit at 14 yuan to gain a good reputation, saying that re-exports of high-grade white rice would stop at the limit. At that time, we were entering the new harvest season and trusted your association, not considering other possibilities. Unexpectedly, the goods from the producing areas are now exhausted, transportation is difficult, and prices in the producing areas are high, leading to a sharp reduction in supply. At the same time, Shanghai's reserves are low, and your industry and the hoarders are vigorously releasing prices to absorb supply. Therefore, although the joint meeting on the 5th of this month decided to raise the limit by one yuan, it was still impossible to control the situation. This is your association's fault. Our industry has worked hard for years, selling rice at the door and striving to fulfill our obligations. We can say without shame that we have done our best. However, your letter in the newspaper suddenly blamed us. In order to clarify the truth, we cannot remain silent. We hope that your association will not blame others with empty words to deceive the public, and should eliminate the chaotic conspiracy and restrain yourselves properly, so that we can have hope of returning rice prices to normal. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Trade Association, from Nanchang Rice Store, Hengshengong Rice Store, Yuchang Rice Store, Xinyixing Rice Store, Wufengtai Rice Store, Fuchang Rice Store, Dachang Rice Store, Sanyang Rice Store, Xinshenghe Rice Store, and others.

The Overall Food Supply is Temporarily Assured

Yesterday, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the market that the cause of the soaring rice prices was indeed the manipulation by hoarders. However, the Shanghai Concession has been under martial law, causing citizens to rush to buy rice. The business of rice stores has doubled in recent days, and the market is having difficulty keeping up. The price of top-grade white rice has actually risen to 17.70 yuan per shi. This phenomenon is indeed unfortunate for Shanghai. However, the recent national rice shipments to Shanghai have not been interrupted. Although they are less than before, this is a phenomenon that is inevitable during the transition between harvests. There are still abundant reserves, so the overall food supply is temporarily assured.

Wuhu Relaxes Restrictions; Indica Rice is Sufficient

After rice industry groups worked hard to find sources, the ban on rice leaving Wuhu has been lifted after negotiations with rice merchants. However, Wuxi and other places still ban the export of white rice. Therefore, Shanghai has recently experienced an unusual shortage of japonica rice. Indica rice is still considered sufficient. In the future, the prices of indica rice and japonica rice will diverge, and japonica rice may become like glutinous rice in the current market.

### The Da Mei Newspaper Requests to File a Protest

Since the American-owned Da Mei Newspaper had its license revoked by the Public Works Department, the newspaper has continued to publish as usual to protest, in addition to requesting the American consul to file a protest. Yesterday, the police prevented the newspaper from being distributed, but the newspaper is determined to continue the struggle to wait for a reasonable and proper resolution.

### The Value of the Japanese Yen is Lower Than the Legal Tender; This Morning, Exchange Shops Bought One Japanese Yen for 98.3 Fen of Legal Tender

--The Japanese Side is Working Hard to Find Ways to Support It--

The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that a Chinese exchange shop on Sichuan Road bought one Japanese yen for 98.3 fen of legal tender this morning (the 19th) and sold it for 98.7 fen. The exchange rate for Bank of Korea banknotes is even lower. The Japanese authorities in Shanghai are urging the Japanese here to conserve their resources in order to support the weakening Japanese yen, and will also work to

Prevent the Japanese Yen

from flowing into the south bank of the Suzhou River in large quantities. According to Japanese authorities, the large-scale southward flow of the Japanese yen is a secondary cause of the weakening of the yen in Shanghai. In addition, measures will be taken to limit the number of Japanese tourists to Shanghai and to strictly supervise ships and other means of transport to prevent the Japanese yen from being transported to Shanghai from North China and Manchuria. Mr. So-and-so, an official from the Japanese Ministry of Finance stationed in Shanghai, is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Japan tomorrow (the 20th) to discuss

the measures to be taken in the future

with government officials. It is reported that the East Asia Institute's Central China Liaison Office, the Japanese Resident Financial Affairs Commissioner's Office in Shanghai, and the Shanghai Office of the Bank of Japan are currently working together to implement the necessary measures, and the East Asia Institute will also formally hold a frugality campaign among Japanese personnel, ordering them to avoid holding banquets and other entertainment at this time. According to the Japanese-language Continental New Daily, the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai and the Consulate General will also respond and intend to encourage savings and remittances back to Japan.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession Holds the "Traffic Safety First" Campaign; The Police Department Invited All Relevant Parties to Form a Committee to Draft a Plan Which Has Been Approved

The first decision-making meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Committee for this year was held on the 15th of this month. Mr. Kai Ziwei was elected as the chairman, and a number of major cases were resolved. There was a detailed decision on the propaganda week for the "Safety First" campaign. The Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police reported to the authorities that the congested situation this year is a matter of concern in terms of traffic safety. Therefore, it is planned to hold the "Traffic Safety First" campaign. This proposal has been approved by the Board of Directors in principle, but the authorities cannot bear the huge costs. Any expenses must be approved by the Board of Directors. In this regard, the Assistant Chief of the Police Department, Baker, invited representatives from all relevant parties to a meeting, and the representatives formed a committee to start investigating and drafting the campaign plan. At the beginning of the investigation, the committee asked the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors to allocate 2,000 yuan first, and a detailed budget would be reported separately. The Board of Directors immediately replied, approving the allocation of 1,000 yuan first, and would consider it further when the committee made another report. On the 15th of this month, the secretary of the Safety First Campaign Preparatory Committee sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council with the proposed plan and expenditure budget. According to the sections listed in the budget, this campaign would require 7,782.5 yuan if held within a limited scope. If the scope is expanded, the committee believes that 10,000 yuan would be needed. The committee asked the authorities to reply by letter, whether the proposed plan could be agreed to, whether all departments of the Shanghai Municipal Council could enthusiastically cooperate, whether the required funds could be fully borne by the authorities, or whether a partial subsidy could be given. If only a partial subsidy is given, could the authorities approve the request for subsidies from various public utility companies, major merchants, and the French Concession Public Works Bureau? Regarding this matter, in addition to the fact that all departments of the Shanghai Municipal Council have expressed their willingness to cooperate with the committee, the Police Committee has reconsidered it in detail. The committee members expressed the opinion that this campaign would be welcomed by the majority of residents and would have real value. Although the estimated expenditure of 10,000 yuan is a large amount, it may in fact be necessary. Public transportation companies and insurance companies should be happy to assist due to the value of this campaign. However, since this plan is designed for the public good, the burden on private merchants should not be too heavy. The committee then resolved to recommend to the Board of Directors that the plan proposed by the Safety First Campaign Committee should be approved in principle, with slight modifications to the plan proposed by the Police Department. All departments of the Shanghai Municipal Council should cooperate as much as possible in the Safety First campaign. The proposal to request subsidies should be approved. As for the funds allocated by the authorities, it should be guaranteed to be equal to the amount of subsidies received from other sources, but should not exceed 5,000 yuan. All of the above recommendations have been approved by the Board of Directors. The propaganda outline proposed by the Traffic Safety First Campaign Propaganda Committee is translated below:

### Traffic Safety First Campaign Propaganda Committee Report

The members of this committee have attended the previous decision-making meetings of the preparatory committee and have held multiple meetings to discuss the facilities and recommendations of other subcommittees. Since April 11, this committee has been publicizing in newspapers, asking newspapers to publish slogans about putting safety first when walking, and to draw pictures, published once every three days. This method of publicity will be intensified in the future, until the start of "Avoid Disasters" Week. Various newspapers in Chinese, English, and Russian have set aside space to publish the propaganda text of this committee free of charge. This committee has also sent letters to the editors of various newspapers to promote the campaign. All plans of this committee, now and in the future, will be sent to various newspapers at any time. The most important task of this committee is to contact other subcommittees, prepare a definite plan, and compile an expense budget. Before "Avoid Disasters" Week, this committee intends to hold a publicity campaign that is not related to the safety campaign itself. "Avoid Disasters" Week is scheduled for June 4 (Sunday) to June 10 (Saturday). During this week, this committee intends to invite all public utility companies, transportation companies, private car owners, taxi owners, bicycle shops, rickshaw shops, and vehicle authorities in the two concessions to cooperate in avoiding vehicle accidents and to find ways to make all vehicles and pedestrians be extra careful to seek safety. The intention of this campaign is to lay the foundation for improving the situation in the two concessions and to gradually reduce accidents. This meeting resolved to adopt the opinions of various subcommittees and use the following methods to carry out publicity for pedestrians and vehicles.

### Propaganda Outline

I. Pedestrians

Hire hundreds of storytellers to tell stories in lively places to the general uneducated classes, explaining that walking should be alert and cautious, etc. At the same time, dispatch many older Boy Scouts (not in uniform) to distribute leaflets with concise text explaining the main points of this committee.

For the general educated population, post notices in shops, bars, teahouses, public halls, and various vehicles, and use the broadcast network composed of 40 Chinese commercial radio stations to widely disseminate the message. On one hand, patrol police from various police stations will do their best to guide pedestrians to walk on the sidewalks and instruct them on how to cross intersections with traffic lights and traffic police.

In the more lively sections of major roads, older Boy Scouts will hold flags with Chinese slogans, advising pedestrians not to leave the sidewalks, not to linger, and not to be reckless. Major stores and department stores are requested to cooperate to the best of their ability. Insert texts warning the audience not to be reckless when walking into the programs of cinemas and entertainment venues. Other various publicity methods are listed in the following sections, and the purpose is to advise the public to strive for traffic safety.

II. Students

Each day, teachers will teach students of all grades in each school a short lesson on road safety. The cooperation of the education departments of the two concessions is requested for this work. Short essay contests will also be held in schools. After the principals have evaluated the essays, this committee will give a small number of prizes.

For foreign schools, this committee believes that teachers can prepare short lessons. Each teacher will be able to explain the facts about various aspects of traffic hazards clearly in five days. The necessary information will be provided by the Traffic Department.

For Chinese schools, the authorities of the two concessions should be able to expand the existing lecture courses. During the campaign week, lecturers will give lectures every day. If this method is not possible, then the necessary information will be provided to Chinese teachers. The Education Department will handle the schools under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council.

Teachers in each school will distribute buttons printed with the words "Safety First" to each student to attract the attention of students' parents and nannies and to make this campaign popular. (To be continued)

### Shanghai Municipal Council Police Committee Meeting

The first decision-making meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Committee for this year was held on the 15th of this month. Mr. Kai Ziwei was elected as the chairman, and a number of major cases were resolved as follows:

(1) Children's Protection Division Case The Board of Directors of the American Social Hall sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, stating that in order to participate in the work of rescuing impoverished children, the Hall intends to hire a social work officer to serve under the direction of the Shanghai Municipal Council Children's Protection Division for at least one year. If the proposed plan is effective, it will be extended. The funds required for the officer's salary and other administrative expenses this year have been raised by the Hall for 2,000 yuan, etc. The Police Committee resolved to request the authorities to approve the method proposed by the Hall. The committee members said that according to the facts listed by the Children's Protection Division last month, how to protect children who are separated from their biological parents and abused by others is a major issue. It would be of great benefit to increase the number of officers handling protection affairs. The authorities should direct the officer recommended by the Hall on the one hand and closely contact the Hall on the other hand for cooperation. This recommendation has been approved by the Board of Directors.

(2) Tavern License Case In October of last year, someone proposed to establish a tavern at 681 Sichuan Road and applied to the Shanghai Municipal Council for a license. The Navy Youth Association, with the support of the American Consul General, protested, and the Shanghai Municipal Council did not allow the tavern to be opened there. The petitioner now intends to open a tavern on the side of the same building along Suzhou Road. The Navy Youth Association has again expressed opposition with the support of the American Consul General. At the same time, someone else proposed to open a tavern at 625 Sichuan Road, which is opposite the Navy Youth Association, and applied for a temporary license. The authorities believed that once this case was announced, it would be opposed, so the two cases were submitted to the Police Committee for review. The Navy Youth Association believes that if there are places selling alcohol near the association, it will be detrimental to its affairs. The American Consul General also agreed. In view of these opinions, the Police Committee believed that there were reasons, and there were already places selling alcohol in the Sichuan Road area, so it resolved to request the Board of Directors to approve the request of the Navy Youth Association to refuse to issue the license. This recommendation was approved by the Board of Directors.

### At the Request of the Japanese Side, the Police Department Arrested Chinese Lu Cishan; Accused of Being Involved with Guerrillas; Suspicious Advertisements Appeared in Japanese Newspapers

The Zi Lin Bao reported that yesterday (the 18th) it was learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, at the request of the Japanese authorities, sent detectives to arrest Chinese Lu Jueshan (transliteration) at 4:00 pm on Sunday. Lu lives at 227 Qipulu and is said to be a wealthy landowner. He is now detained at the Fuzhou Road Police Station. It is reported that Lu was arrested because he was accused of being

Involved in Guerrilla

Activities. However, when he was interrogated in the past four days, he did not admit to having any political connections. This case is quite mysterious, because last week, an advertisement appeared in the local Japanese-language Continental New Daily, inviting one Japanese assistant. Applicants could dial a certain number. The

Telephone Number

was Lu's residence. Many Japanese people dialed the number to apply. Mr. Lu did not admit to publishing the advertisement and finally complained to the telephone company, saying that he received an increasing number of calls that were not intended for him, causing him great annoyance. The authorities are continuing to investigate this case.

### In Order to Raise Funds for Silkworm Cocoons, the Puppet Regime Still Intends to Implement Control; Manufacturers Do Not Cooperate

Spring cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang are gradually entering the market. The Zhejiang Provincial Oil Tea Cotton and Silk Management Office, in order to support cocoon merchants and help silkworm farmers, has specially loaned 1.5 million yuan for silkworm cocoons, to the extent of the full loan amount, and has formulated loan methods and procedures, ordering cocoon merchants in various counties to organize cocoon collection groups to avoid unnecessary competition. All cocoon merchants who want to purchase silkworm cocoons in Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Shaoxing, Shengxian, Xinchang, Shangyu, Lanxi, and Fuyang Naxiang and other places, but lack funds, should apply for loans directly to the relevant silk cocoon offices in accordance with the prescribed methods and procedures. They must provide 20% cash in advance, obtain a guarantee from a well-established merchant, and submit a loan application to the silk cocoon department of the relevant office. After the application is approved by the office, a loan approval notice will be issued, and the borrower can use this notice to go directly to the silk cocoon department of the office to sign a contract and withdraw funds, etc. The monthly interest rate for this loan is set at 9% for ordinary cocoon merchants and reduced to 7% for cooperative unions.

Puppet Regime Control

Because last year's control plan failed, the puppet organization is only controlling one district in Jiangsu this year. A notice was issued by the puppet "Jiangsu Construction Department" stating that all those who want to purchase spring cocoons in the occupied areas of Jiangsu Province must register before May 20, and a security deposit of 3 yuan per market dan of dried cocoons must be paid, with each stove calculated at 15 market dan. However, only three days before the deadline, the number of manufacturers going to register and purchase was very small. The cocoon trading volume has decreased significantly compared to the past.

Burning Down Cocoon Factories

Silkworm silk from Zhejiang Province is the only sideline occupation in rural areas, so its output is the highest in the country. Since the areas along the railways and highways were occupied, most of the cocoon factories and houses were destroyed by artillery fire, and very few remain. Because the Chinese guerrillas were afraid that the silk cocoons in the occupied areas would be controlled and purchased and used by others, they recently burned down all the remaining cocoon factories and cocoon stoves in Fengshi Temple, Changan, and other places. It will be difficult to rebuild them in the near future. This year's spring cocoons will thus make it impossible for the villagers to sell them and they will have to reel them themselves.

### Japanese Customs Tax Office Announces Restrictions on Navigation and Customs Clearance; No Clearance Without Japanese Military Permit; Foreign Merchants Again Suffer Illegal Restraints From Fetal Spirits

Foreign merchant ships sailing to various ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River have recently been frequently blocked, and foreign merchant ships sailing along the Zhejiang coast have also been frequently boarded for searches and various difficulties. Foreign merchants in general only dare to be angry and not speak out. Their business has plummeted. It is now reported that the Customs has set a method and notified the shipping companies yesterday to comply. The announcement by Mr. Oyamada, the Japanese Customs Tax Office of the Jianghai Customs, is recorded below (translation): For military reasons, starting from June 1, all ships must not be cleared without a permit from the Japanese Army or Navy and must not sail to the following places: Haimen, Qidong, Xinyang Port, Funing in Jiangsu, Haimen, Xinghua, Xiangyu, Quanzhou, Hanjiang in Zhejiang, etc.

### Moufu Wheel Sails to Ningbo This Morning; Gaodeng Sailed to Dinghai Yesterday; Haifu and Feikang Sailed to Wenzhou

The Defense Commanders of Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, in order to dredge the freight, with the approval of the Commander-in-Chief Liu of the 10th Army Group, the Shanghai-Dinghai Line, the Dinghai-Ningbo Line, the Shanghai-Wenzhou Line, and the Shanghai-Ningbo Qian Line were resumed. (1) Shanghai-Ningbo Line: The Moufu Wheel of the German Reiss & Co. sailed directly to Ningbo this morning. This wheel is the first to resume operations after the resumption of the Shanghai-Ningbo route. (2) Shanghai-Dinghai Line: The Hana Wheel of the German Far East Company sailed from 5:30 pm yesterday, loaded with cargo and passengers, and sailed to Dinghai. (3) Ningbo-Dinghai-Shanghai: The Gaodeng Wheel of the German Lulin & Co. sailed from Shanghai to Dinghai at 5:00 pm yesterday. After arriving in Dinghai, it will resume the Ningbo-Dinghai route. (4) Shanghai-Wenzhou Line: After various shipping companies assigned ships to operate regularly, the Haifu Wheel of the German Reiss & Co. and the Feikang Wheel of the German Lulin & Co. were scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou this morning.

### Resuming Navigation in Fujian Sea: Xinjiang Steamer to Quanzhou, Lisheng Steamer to Fuzhou

Due to the presence of over twenty Japanese warships and frequent bombing raids by Japanese aircraft on Fuzhou and Quanzhou, the maritime situation in Fujian Province had been tense. According to reports from the shipping industry, a portion of the Japanese warships has departed, but three Japanese warships remain anchored outside the Min River estuary, and Japanese aircraft continue to conduct reconnaissance flights. The coastal situation is now relatively peaceful, and the public is calm. The Shanghai Navigation Bureau temporarily prohibited navigation to Quanzhou for defense purposes. However, a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency has learned from the shipping industry that the situation has eased, and the industry has received approval from the authorities to resume navigation to alleviate passenger and cargo congestion. The British Xinjiang Steamer is scheduled to be the first to sail to Quanzhou on the 23rd to resume navigation. The British Jardine Matheson's Lisheng Steamer is scheduled to sail to Fuzhou on the 19th, but this trip will not stop at Xinghua Bay.

### Two US Gunboats Scheduled for Scrapping

According to the Mainland Press, it was learned yesterday (the 18th) that the British 645-ton gunboats HMS Cricket and HMS Mantis, which have served in Chinese rivers for nearly twenty years, are scheduled to be sold for scrap next month. They will be replaced by new-style gunboats HMS Dragonfly and HMS Grasshopper. The two new ships are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in mid-June. It is expected that the Grasshopper has already arrived in Hong Kong today (the 19th, or tomorrow). The Dragonfly should also arrive in Hong Kong, stay for two weeks, and the troop transport ship HMS Dunera is also scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in mid-June, bringing 200 replacement officers and soldiers.

### British Warship HMS Dorsetshire Suddenly Leaves Shanghai

According to the Mainland Press, the British cruiser HMS Dorsetshire, which had been docked in Shanghai for several weeks, suddenly weighed anchor and sailed to Hong Kong at 2:30 PM yesterday. British naval authorities did not announce the ship's departure in advance, only stating that its southward voyage was a "routine operation." The US coastal defense ship USS Tulsa is scheduled to weigh anchor and sail to the South China Sea at noon today. This ship arrived from Qinhuangdao last week and was originally scheduled to sail to Fuzhou, but the plan was canceled due to reports of mines drifting into the sea in the Min River.

### Ministry of Finance Issues Order to Reject "Hua Hsing Bank" Banknotes: Strictly Adhere to Stance, Avoid Dealings, Isolate to Reduce Harm

Regarding the issuance of banknotes by the "Hua Hsing Bank," the Ministry of Finance has issued an order to all provinces, cities, and industries to uniformly reject their use and avoid dealings. The original order stated that the "Hua Hsing Bank" was reportedly officially established at the New Asia Hotel in Shanghai on May 1st, with a capital of 50 million yuan, half borne by the "Reformed Government" and half by six Japanese banks. It was also decided to issue banknotes in denominations of ten yuan, five yuan, one yuan, two jiao, and one jiao. This kind of bank with fictitious capital and indiscriminate issuance of banknotes aims to undermine China's financial system, disrupt monetary policy, and achieve its ambition of monopolizing East Asia and excluding foreign interests in China. The establishment of the "Joint Reserve Bank of North China" and the issuance of unprepared banknotes were previously denounced by the Ministry as a poisonous scheme, and propaganda was disseminated to the people in the guerrilla areas. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was also requested to inform the embassies of various countries in China, asking them to notify overseas merchants to uniformly reject the use of these banknotes and instruct the national financial industry to strictly adhere to its stance, refuse to use the banknotes, and avoid dealings. Now that the market value of these banknotes in North China is declining daily, the so-called "Hua Hsing Bank" has been established in Shanghai and empty banknotes are being issued, further demonstrating its deceptive tricks. All in the financial industry and other industries should strictly adhere to the position, uniformly reject the use of the banknotes and any notes, and absolutely do not associate, so that the bank is isolated in order to reduce the harm and maintain our legitimate rights. In addition to issuing orders for compliance, a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to submit a note to the embassies of various countries, asking for unanimous rejection. It is hoped that everyone will follow the instructions. Seal of the Ministry of Finance in Jiangyu.

### Ningbo Gradually Becoming Quiet: Japanese Warships Shell Zhenhai Twice, Shaoxing Bombed by Japanese Aircraft

Since Ningbo was bombed for the eighth time on the 10th, there have been no Japanese air raids since the 15th. However, on the 15th and 17th, Japanese warships shelled the Zhenhai Fortress from the waters off Qiliyu and Ligang outside Zhenhai Port. The Japanese warships then withdrew, and the garrison did not retaliate, suffering no losses.

Evacuation of Population

The Yin County government, fearing that rural villagers might raise rents for urban residents evacuating to the countryside, specifically ordered township offices and police stations to supervise and maintain order, and prohibited soliciting donations or conscripting soldiers from them.

Post-Disaster Relief

In terms of relief and rehabilitation, all sectors of Ningbo are actively working on it. In terms of funds, the National Relief Commission has allocated funds for relief. The Ningbo Native Place Association is now working hard to urgently raise funds for relief, and the situation is quite enthusiastic. When the time comes, the results will exceed the predetermined amount of 50,000 yuan.

Foreign Property

It is also learned that when Ningbo was brutally bombed by Japanese aircraft for the fifth time on the 9th of this month, a bomb that fell in the Fayuan Lane hit the roof of the British Baptist Church, a foreign property marked with the British flag emblem, causing significant damage.

Shaoxing Bombed

According to refugees arriving in Shanghai from Shaoxing, at 8:40 AM on the 3rd, five Japanese seaplanes flew into the county airspace from the Longshan area north of the town, circling at low altitude for reconnaissance, and then recklessly bombed. The bombing lasted for about an hour before returning along the original route. A total of fourteen bombs were dropped. Shaoxing Middle School and its affiliated primary school, the Shaoxing Chamber of Commerce, the commercial district of Dama Road, the residential area of Duanhetou Yuechifang, and the Shaoxing Relief Center were all hit by bombs. The Special Commissioner's Office and the Shaoxing County Government were also hit, destroying several houses. The commercial district of Dama Road also caught fire, which burned until 1:00 PM, destroying more than eighty houses and causing nearly a hundred casualties. The Chamber of Commerce building was bombed and collapsed, killing a staff member named Chen. Five or six policemen were also injured.

### Arrest of a Person Transporting Narcotics from Beiping to Shanghai

Sun Jinsheng, a 33-year-old Suzhou native residing at 26 Route de la Mairie, French Concession, recently transported one pound of morphine, valued at over 1,000 yuan, from Beiping. He arrived in Shanghai on the Taikoo Steamship Company's Shengjing vessel. At 10:00 AM on the 18th, Sun was unloading goods and was apprehended by French Concession detectives Cai Jinzhang, Zhu Ju, and Xu Shangen at the edge of Taikoo Wharf No. 3. Suspecting his behavior, they searched him and found morphine.

According to the North China Daily News, the case of Mr. Lilley, Principal of the Lester Institute of Technology, who died in a car accident involving a Japanese public bus near Broadway and Minghang Road at just after 9:00 PM on April 24th, was continued yesterday (the 18th) by British Police Court Coroner Haines. After the five witnesses testified, the case was adjourned until 2:15 PM on Monday, when Mrs. Lilley is expected to testify.

Representing Japan

Several officers from the Naval Landing Forces also attended the court yesterday, and two Japanese recorded the testimony. The first two witnesses were Knowles, Detective Chief of the Criminal Division of the Central Police Station, who took seven photographs at the scene of the accident at 10:00 PM on the 24th, and Turner, a trainee officer from the Traffic Division of the Central Police Station, who personally drew a diagram on Broadway and Minghang Road on the evening, clearly showing the positions of the two vehicles. The next witness was Abellansky, a Western Constable from the Hongkou Police Station, who told the coroner that at 9:12 PM on the 24th, he accompanied Chinese Detective No. 33 to

Broadway

Near Minghang Road, where he saw two foreign men on stretchers next to a fire truck, and a Western woman with a bloody face. At the scene, there was a car with license plate number 5593 and a Japanese public bus with license plate number 814. The two vehicles were three hundred yards east of the corner of Minghang Road. The public bus was facing east, and the car was facing west. At that time, he collected information at the scene and made brief notes, but was obstructed by the Japanese marines. He then asked the Chinese detective to report to the Hongkou Police Station and directed the ambulance driver to take the injured to the hospital. He saw that a Chinese

Female Ticket Seller

Was approaching in the public bus, her face was bleeding. He ordered her and three others to enter the ambulance together. When they arrived at the Country Hospital, the two men were treated by Dr. Patrick, Mrs. Lilley was sent upstairs, and the Chinese woman was transferred to Renji Hospital. Western Constable A. continued that the road was wet and slippery at the time. In response to questioning from Mrs. Lilley's lawyer, Mr. Maestre, Mr. A. said that a Western woman ran towards A. from the stretcher, shouting that her husband was dead, and told A. that her name was Lilley. A. continued that he then noticed that one of the two people on the stretcher was a police officer, and upon closer inspection, he found that it was Western Constable Wimsett, dressed in plain clothes. He did not recognize the

Western Man

Corporal McDonald of the West Yorkshire Regiment then stated that at 8:40 PM on the 24th, he was on duty at the Garden Bridge. At about that time, he saw a Ford car driving from the north and stopping in front of the police booth on the Garden Bridge. He saw that the front right lights of the car were damaged. A British man and woman got out of the car and reported to the Western Constable of the local police station that an accident had occurred. The British woman showed the damaged part of the car to the Western Constable and asked him to accompany her to show the location of the accident. The Western Constable then got into the back of the car, which was driven by the man, and drove across the bridge into the Japanese-controlled area.

About Half an Hour

Later, a foreigner living at 1006 Avenue Joffre reported to him that there was a car accident, with four or five Americans involved. British soldier McDonald then told the Japanese police officers on duty on the bridge to inform the Japanese marines. McDonald, with the help of two Chinese constables, telephoned the Central Police Station to report the accident. The Chinese female ticket seller of the public bus, who lived opposite the Shanghai Yarn Factory on Guangxin Road, sat among the Japanese officers who attended the court. It was said that the public bus was owned by the China-Japan Joint Venture Huazhong Company. Coroner Haines asked if the public bus had had an accident last month. No. Mr. Haines asked, "Never?" Answer: "I don't know."

Mr. Haines then Asked

Her whether she was injured last month, and how she was injured. She replied that it was due to a collision between two vehicles. She also said that a month ago, a foreign car collided with a public bus near Broadway and Minghang Road. The public bus was driven by a Chinese. She was in the back of the car selling tickets when she was injured and did not see anything. The Coroner said, "I am not asking what you saw, but what happened to you." She replied, "I don't know." The Coroner then asked, "How did you know you were injured?" The female ticket seller replied that she lost consciousness after the two vehicles collided. The Coroner then said to the interpreter, "Tell this witness that she was very detailed in her account to the police officers

And Seems to Have Forgotten Now?"

The female ticket seller replied that she did not know what she told the police officers. She only regained consciousness after being carried to the hospital. She also said that she did not see the public bus collide. The public bus departed from the Garden Bridge and drove along Broadway at a speed of slightly over 25 miles per hour. Mr. Haines asked, "How could she estimate the speed?" She replied that this was the maximum speed stipulated by the company and that the car seemed to be driving quite slowly at the time. Thereupon, the Coroner dismissed the court until Monday for further questioning.

To the Editor:

Regarding the report in the "Local News" section of your newspaper on the 13th of this month, titled "Post-War New Factories Surge, Cotton Mills Congregate in Shanghai—A First-Hand Account," which stated that among British-owned yarn mills, only Ewo Mills produces yarn, and that the yarn it produces is insufficient for the other three mills to weave cloth, and that it is necessary to purchase yarn from Chinese and Japanese mills, we would like to clarify that our company, including Ewo, Yangtszepoo, and Ewo Cotton Mills, has a total of 170,000 spindles and 3,320 looms. All three mills spin yarn using surplus yarn sold in the market and have never purchased yarn from Chinese or Japanese mills. We request that you correct this to avoid public misunderstanding.

Education News

### ### Overview of Chinese Secondary Education (I)

Restricting the Establishment of Middle School Districts, Preventing the Manufacture of Schools, and Prioritizing the Allocation of New Funding to Vocational Teacher Training

(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The total number of secondary education schools, teachers, students, and funding before the war, as well as the situation of the national middle schools newly established by the Ministry of Education and the teacher service corps after the war, have been published in this newspaper. The following is a summary of the Ministry of Education's overall system and measures for middle schools over the past ten years:

System Aspect

In the 11th year of the Republic (1922), the new education system implemented a 3-3 system for middle schools and adopted the multi-disciplinary middle school method, allowing the establishment of vocational and normal education departments. The duration of study could be 4-2 or 2-4 years, depending on local conditions. In the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the University Council felt that the multi-disciplinary system was difficult to achieve practical results and ordered that normal schools should be established independently in principle. In the 21st year of the Republic (1932), the National Government promulgated the Middle School Law, and at the same time promulgated the Normal School Law and the Vocational School Law, clarifying that the three types of middle schools should be established independently to exert their special functions. The Middle School Law stipulated that middle schools should be divided into junior and senior levels, each with a three-year duration of study. In the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the Ministry of Education formulated the Middle School Regulations based on this decision and continued to amend them, detailing all the facilities that secondary education should have, and the middle school system was largely prepared. Both junior and senior middle schools in the 3-3 system could be established independently.

Establishment Aspect

Middle schools should be established by provinces or municipalities directly under the central government in principle. Counties and cities may also establish them, but only if there is a need to establish a middle school according to local conditions, and if it does not hinder the facilities for elementary education. Private individuals or groups may also establish middle schools. Since the implementation of the new education system, counties in each province have competed to run junior middle schools, calling for raising the local cultural level, encroaching on local elementary education funding, hindering its development, lowering the required level of secondary education, manufacturing crudely, cultivating a large number of graduates who could not advance to higher education and could not make a living, harming youth, and affecting society more than anything else. The abuse of private middle schools was even more harmful. In the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the Ministry of Education restricted the establishment of ordinary middle schools, ordering county middle schools to gradually change to vocational schools or rural normal schools for adjustment. When the Middle School Law was promulgated, the distinction between counties and cities in running middle schools was determined, which was to attach importance to the status of middle schools and to make them standardized and rationalized. As for private middle schools, the Regulations for Private Schools were promulgated to regulate them, rewarding the good ones and cracking down on the bad ones. After ten years of supervision and rectification, they have largely reached the standard. In the 26th year of the Republic (1937), the Ministry of Education selected nine excellent middle schools across the country to carry out middle school experimental education, and private schools accounted for four of them, which shows the government's emphasis on both public and private schools.

In the past, the establishment of public and private middle schools in various provinces was often concentrated in a few large cities. Elementary school graduates in the inland areas could not afford secondary education due to long distances and high costs. For the adjustment, the Ministry of Education formulated the Measures for Dividing Middle School Districts in the 27th year of the Republic (1938), ordering each province to divide the province into several middle school districts according to local traffic, population, economy, culture, and existing school conditions. In principle, a middle school district should be established by the province with a combined high and junior middle school, and each county in the district should be equipped with a single or jointly established junior middle school, so that elementary school graduates and junior middle school graduates could attend school nearby. If the locality is underdeveloped and funding is particularly difficult, the province should first establish one or two junior middle schools in a suitable location in the district and slowly establish senior high schools. Private middle schools should also be included in the overall planning of the number of schools in the district. County private middle schools should also be carefully examined, and those with better results should be strengthened, while county middle schools that are not needed and have poor results should be ordered to close or merge in order to achieve practical results.

### The Purpose and Work of the Shanghai Society for the Protection of Animals

Since humanity's understanding and compassion for the suffering of animals has grown, animal protection societies have been established in countries around the world, gradually evolving from simple to more comprehensive organizations. The term "animals" actually includes all kinds of beasts, birds, and fish, whether domestic or wild. Mistreatment of animals can be intentional, unintentional, due to ignorance, or due to economic factors. This last reason is often seen in China. The initial purpose of these societies is often focused on local conditions. In other words, they try to reduce all kinds of animal abuse that exist locally and provide humane treatment for ownerless wild animals. As the strength of the societies increases, their scope of activities expands greatly.

Based on knowledge gained from past humanitarian endeavors, the methods of operation can be summarized as follows:

1.  Advocate for legislation regarding the humane slaughter of animals.

2.  Prohibit and regulate animal dissection.

3.  Improve methods of trapping animals and birds.

4.  Protect and assist migrating birds, especially those on the coast. Our predecessor, the Royal Society, will submit a proposal to the League of Nations to prohibit oil-fueled ships from discharging fuel oil within a certain distance of the coast. This is because thousands of seabirds die each year from starvation because their feathers are soaked in oil, preventing them from flying.

5.  Educate the public through appropriate writing and lectures.

6.  Cultivate humanitarian education in children.

7.  Widespread publicity of activities.

This activity is international in nature, and international conferences are convened regularly to exchange opinions and coordinate work. There is also an international publication that has a significant impact. October 4th is known as "Animal Day," and it is celebrated in Europe and America.

The above is about the general activities of animal protection societies. Now, let us briefly describe the activities of the Shanghai Society. The origin of the Shanghai Society is obscure and difficult to trace, but it was founded more than 30 years ago. At that time, the Mixed Court exercised its authority in Shanghai, so the Shanghai Municipal Council formulated some humanitarian regulations and attached them to the market and vehicle license regulations. These regulations were enforced by the Mixed Court, and any fines were paid to the Society. Later, due to the abolition of the Mixed Court, and the fact that Chinese law at that time did not have regulations prohibiting animal cruelty, there were great difficulties in imposing penalties. Therefore, the activities of the Society were delayed for many years, and by 1932, only one senior staff member and about 20 members remained. (For several years, there was no office, no investigators, and no issuance of reports.) In the spring of that year, as a result of the brutality of the war, thousands of animals suffered the pain of displacement, starvation, and harm. Social sympathy extended not only to the displaced refugees but also to the animals that had no way to escape. At that time, the police authorities were unable to address this issue, so an active animal protection society became a practical necessity and was quite active. The Society then engaged in reorganization and innovation, and by 1933, it had made considerable progress and was able to hire a part-time secretary. Since 1932, the Society's membership has increased from 20 to more than 800, and it has been able to hire a full-time secretary and an investigator in uniform. The Society also has an office in the Shanghai Race Club, with rent waived, for which we must thank the club. In addition, Sir Austen, who is enthusiastic about animal protection, donated a rescue vehicle, so that sick and injured animals can be sent directly to veterinary hospitals for treatment, and the Society's investigators can expand the area of investigation. In 1936, the Society's quarterly magazine was born, which has been a great help to the Society's publicity department since its publication. In the past four years, the Shanghai Society has been one of the most active societies of its kind in the world.

The Society's organization transcends national boundaries and is completely open. Our goal is to make it universal and international. At present, the Society's members include people of at least 15 nationalities. For example, Mr. Zhang Jianyun was one of the executive members of the Society before his death. When President Guan Jiongzhi was in Shanghai, he was very enthusiastic about the Society's affairs and was willing to help in every way. The Society is immensely grateful to the above two Chinese gentlemen. The purpose of the Society can be briefly stated as follows: to improve the humane treatment of animals in China, especially in the Shanghai area, and to implement the purpose of education, persuasion, promotion of laws, and rescue of suffering animals within the scope of possibility. Poor economic conditions often lead to a lack of empathy, resulting in indifference to the suffering of animals; therefore, the fact that domestic animals are sacrificed to overwork and neglect is not due to the bad intentions of the owners, but rather to a lack of thoughtfulness, which is a common factor. Because the legal basis is very weak, the Society's work is limited, and it has to rely on persuasion and education of the public to awaken individuals' understanding of animals as a matter of urgency; secondly, it is necessary to clarify the importance of legislation to protect animals. In fact, the purpose of the Society is very simple: to create a solid and flourishing social consciousness that has a compassionate view of the suffering of animals, and then use persuasion to eliminate violent behavior.

Then, some may ask: What work has your Society already done? The Society does not dare to boast too much, saying that the majority of the Society's work is devoted to education, but that work has indeed been effective. There are several decentralized and independent authorities managing this city, and most of the animal suffering that can be stopped depends on the sympathetic action of these authorities. In recent years, the authorities have also implemented many in-depth improvements. The Society cannot claim all the credit for these improvements, but the fact that the authorities are willing to carefully consider the suggestions often made by the Society is enough to prove that the Society has a need to exist. However, the success of several improvements is the result of the public's growing interest in the well-being of animals, and the Society can share some of the glory.

It has been mentioned above that the Society employs an investigator in uniform, whose work is not idle. If anyone does not believe it, the investigator welcomes them to accompany him during his work. The investigator inspects various markets, examines dog kennels and medical schools, monitors the loading and unloading of animals in water and land transportation, and tracks down reports of animal cruelty. He also often has to humanely euthanize incurable stray cats to prevent them from suffering indefinitely. Another task of the Society's investigator is to inspect various animal slaughterhouses, paying close attention to the humane treatment of animals from the time they are sent to the slaughterhouse. He supervises the humane treatment of animals, such as replacing the old and cruel nose rings with ropes on the horns, and providing them with adequate drinking water every month. The investigator also pays attention to the pigs in the transport vehicles and the chickens and ducks in the baskets to see if they are too crowded. Often, by pointing out such violations of the inhumane provisions on the license to the police, fines can be imposed. However, these fines are no longer paid to the Society. The Society often gives small rewards to Chinese police officers who are helpful in such matters.

The Society hopes that recent legislation will include regulations requiring the use of vehicles to transport animals such as sheep and dairy cows. Walking on the roads in the city is a cruel thing, especially in hot weather. The following most obvious example can be removed by punishment, and this matter has been reported in the newspapers, and you must have read it. That is, pig bristles, which everyone knows, can be exchanged for goods. Therefore, the pig herders and butchers, whenever they have pigs in hand, pluck the bristles from the live pigs to increase their meager income. The suffering of the animals from this treatment is beyond imagination. An investigator of the Society, after witnessing such an incident, immediately detained the responsible coolie and charged him with "nuisance." The charge of "nuisance" includes many kinds of crimes, and the Society wanted to know at that time whether such cruel behavior could also be charged with this crime. In time, the case was tried in the local court, and after all kinds of evidence were presented, the judge ruled that it was not accepted. Therefore, the Assistant Legal Officer of the Municipal Council applied to change the accusation to "theft"—stealing the pig bristles, the property of the pig owner. As for the coolie's defense, he said that he had no wages and only relied on plucking bristles for his drinking money. The pig owner immediately refuted his statement in court, saying that the coolie actually had a monthly salary of 14 yuan. Therefore, the judge was able to impose a penalty. The most noteworthy thing afterwards was that, a few days later, the police authorities, without notifying the Society, arrested the same kind of offender and achieved the same result. The Society considers the above matter to be the most important thing, that is, after the penalty was imposed, the investigator did not see the same incident happen again in the city. This was commonplace in the past. Some people say that this is just playing with an ignorant coolie, but it is not a happy thing to obtain practical and valuable results. The above matter proves that if there is a law that can accuse the offender of the crime, the penalty can be effective.

At this point, it must be solemnly stated that the Society is not trying to find offenders and punish them, but rather to use education and persuasion to pull the offenders out of the abyss of ignorance. In many cases, those who commit violent acts are often unaware that they are causing terrible suffering. The greatest underlying cause of such events is undoubtedly the hardship of economic life, and thus the ability to be idealistic is also diminished. But sometimes there are many people who are deliberately violent, and only punishment can make them repent.

There are countless examples proving the need for effective legislation. Those who drive pigs often use long sticks with terrifying sharp hooks as driving tools. These sharp hooks pierce into the ears, nose, skin, and flesh of the pigs, causing cruel suffering, but this is not a legal crime and there is no way to complain. Chickens and ducks are often carried by grasping their wings backwards on their backs, causing the joints to dislocate, causing great pain, but everyone thinks that this is the normal way to carry chickens and ducks, and it is not against the law. Recently, a servant beat a cat to death, but this cat was ownerless and could not be punished. You may still remember the news about "Old Soldier" in the newspaper. Old Soldier was a British military horse left behind by the Shanghai Defense Force, and was transferred into the hands of a sycophant, who forced it to work under terrible and arduous conditions, until it was about to die. In fact, it would be better if it could die, because it could be freed from suffering. Finally, with the donations of hundreds of sympathetic people, funds were raised to find a place of rest for the old horse, to spend its old age; the old horse's improvement in life was given by several benefactors. The old horse's bad owner also kept two donkeys, which were found by the investigator to be working in a state of starvation, emaciation, and festering skin. Therefore, the owner was arrested and sued in court, fined for overworking weak animals. In addition, he was ordered to pay the veterinary hospital's medical expenses and had to let the donkey rest for three weeks. Finally, the owner, because the cost of carrying out the order was too high, sent the two donkeys to the Society and used other methods for transportation. The Society recently discovered an old French army horse that was encountering the same fate and is now trying to rescue it and give it a good place of rest.

The situation of hunting animals for fur in China, if described in detail, is shocking. Unfortunately, because the hunting areas are mostly outside the scope of the Society's activities, there is very little work that can be done; but the public awareness that the Society has been working hard to cultivate will awaken and advocate relevant laws to address this issue. Speaking of fur, the love of European and American ladies for fetal lambskin (this trend has gradually subsided) has caused the price of these furs to soar. The manufacturing method of fetal lambskin is extremely cruel. These furs must be taken from the fetal lamb before the hair has grown fully mature in the mother's body. In order to make the fetal lamb born prematurely, the abdomen of the ewe is beaten on both sides with sticks until the desired effect is achieved. This treatment often leads to the death of the ewe, but the value of the fetal lambskin is very high, and the life and death of the ewe is not worth mentioning. Fetal lambskin was obtained in this way, and Zhejiang Province once made lambs disappear because of it. Later, legislation prohibiting the export of fetal lambskin was proposed and strictly enforced, and the trend began to subside. This result was partly due to the efforts of the Society, but the Shanghai Fur Industry Association was an important organization in prohibiting this matter. It is incomprehensible if women can still wear these furs, thinking about the cruel situation when these furs were made.

The Society has never forgotten to educate children to treat animals kindly, so when at school, we often use essay and speech competitions to instill the doctrine of treating animals kindly. The Society's quarterly magazine has a children's column and is printed with beautiful badges for children to wear. Speaking of children's education, there is a misconception that should be corrected here. The Society knows the terrible nature of mad dogs in this city, so it has never taught children to handle stray cats and dogs.

The above, I think, you all know how the Society promotes various works. However, every work requires expenses, and the Society relies solely on voluntary donations from all walks of life. If you are willing to help this kind of humanitarian work, you can join the Society as a member. The annual membership fee is only 5 yuan in national currency. If you pay 20 yuan in national currency at once, you can become a life member. If you do not intend to join, you are also welcome to make a donation at will. For all membership fees and donations, please transfer the money to the Secretariat of the Shanghai Society for the Protection of Animals at No. 184, Rue Massenet, Shanghai.

### Shanghai City Construction Before the War

— Lin Lang

According to the statistics at the end of the 25th year of the Republic of China, the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company installed 3,322 telephones in western Shanghai, 714 in the extra-territorial road area in northern Shanghai, 45 in the southern Shanghai area, and 33 in the northern Shanghai area.

Land Transportation The land transportation tools in the city area, in terms of public ones, include trams, buses, and long-distance buses. (1) Trams. The tram business is operated by the Chinese-owned Electric Company. There are four tram lines with a total length of 23.24 kilometers, with 54 trams and 27 trailers. The third ring road of the company was divided into two sections before the 17th year of the Republic of China, starting and ending in the Laoximen and Xiaodongmen areas respectively. Passengers had to change trains midway, which was very inconvenient. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works ordered the connection of the rails and changed it to a ring road, which opened to traffic in the second half of the 17th year. The second tram line was also supervised by the Bureau and changed to a ring road in the 22nd year. (2) Buses. The Chinese-owned Bus Company signed a contract with the Municipal Government in the 17th year and obtained the right to operate the bus business in the entire city area. In November of that year, it first opened to traffic in Zhabei. After the "January 28th" Incident, the company suffered heavy losses. Later, it replenished its capital and added vehicles to prepare for a comeback. After the Municipal Government moved to the city center, the company resumed operating buses. As of the summer of the 26th year, there were a total of 34 buses, operating on five lines with a total length of 53.2 kilometers. The bus service in the southern Shanghai area was launched by the Southern Shanghai Bus Company in October of the 17th year. However, the company was poorly managed and announced its closure at the end of the 20th year. In April of the 23rd year, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works continued to operate and expanded the routes to Pudong and the Caohijing area in western Shanghai. As of the summer of the 26th year, there were 45 buses, operating on five lines with a total length of 46.5 kilometers. (3) Long-distance buses. There are six long-distance bus companies operating between Shanghai and neighboring counties: Xihu Long-distance Bus Company, Hutai Long-distance Bus Company, Shanghai-Minhang-Nantao Long-distance Bus Line Transportation Company, Shangsong Long-distance Bus Company, Shangnan Transportation Company, and Shangchuan Transportation Company. The vehicles of the first four companies are all buses. The latter two companies laid steel rails and operated steam locomotives. In recent years, their business has been thriving. As for various vehicles with indefinite routes, as of the end of the 25th year, a total of 106,887 vehicles were registered with the Municipal Bureau of Public Works.

Longhua Airport Longhua Airport is located east of Longhua Town, on the bank of the Huangpu River. The airport covers an area of more than 1,200 acres and is the civilian seaplane airport in Shanghai. After the Municipal Government expanded and constructed it, it was handed over to the Management Office of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works for management in November of the 24th year. Successively arranged navigation station equipment, such as the runway for airplanes to take off, which is paved with cement; warehouses for storing airplanes, as well as offices. The take-off and landing of airplanes and the boarding and alighting of passengers are quite convenient. The seaplane wharf and night navigation equipment were also in the process of being equipped, but unfortunately, they became a bubble due to the impact of the war. There are factories of China and Eurasia Airlines in the field. China Airlines' routes depart from Shanghai, south to Guangzhou, north to Peiping, and west to Chengdu and Kunming. The Eurasian Line goes from Shanghai to Zhengzhou, then north to Peiping, south to Guangzhou, and west to Xi'an; then from Xi'an to Kunming or Lanzhou; and between Lanzhou and Peiping, passing through Baotou. According to statistics at the end of the 25th year, the number of flights and passengers at Longhua Airport were highest in October, with 175 flights and 1,200 passengers. (To be continued)

Commercial News

### Food Grain The Open Market in Rice Has Become Public, and Prices are Climbing Above the Limit

Yesterday, various sources and He Xia total four or five, ** rounds of buns. The Su Tongkun gang came with three thousand six or seven hundred buns. The city implemented emergency preparedness, all making preparations for purchase. The market situation felt chaotic again. All rice prices broke through the limit price. Over-the-counter transactions have become secretly public. The highest Changbang white rice was openly sold in the market, priced at 17 yuan and 45 cents. Because the open market has already become public, the sampling of Changshu white rice is gradually increasing, and the prices of thick and thin rice are also rising all the way. However, in the evening market, due to the price increase, it appeared to be sluggish again, with a result of increasing by three or five cents, varying. The situation of Du Yangjian and Bu Jian is similar. The customer tip is high with the rice market, but in the future only one or two cents are good. The yuan is still mediocre. The high price is 20 yuan and five cents.

The customer Xian yesterday arrived and sold vigorously. The market presented a more prosperous atmosphere. When the market opened in the morning, it was appropriate for the authorities of the concession to take emergency measures. The shops and retailers were all moved to purchase, and the over-the-counter transactions on the market were immediately cancelled in the various parties' operations. It was informally cancelled. The selling price of Nanjing Dingji Xian was allowed to be full. A selling price of 15 yuan and 7 cents for Wuxian and 15 yuan and 45 cents has not yet been formally agreed. The sellers are all goods of 15 yuan and 12 cents. The decision meter and the gravel meter are all up to 14 yuan, which is two or three cents higher than the previous day. However, in the evening market, the father returned from the hoarding customers, and the new users waited and watched. The market returned to the market. Corner. Wuyuan rice and Hong Kong Yuan rice have been arriving continuously, and yesterday the market was not smooth. The market price fell sharply by two cents. Although there may be a deal for Saigon by order, the sellers still insist on the original market. The morning transaction was very calm. In the afternoon, 500 packages were traded, and the price was 19 yuan and 6 cents.

### Rice Prices Ascend Step by Step Flour Needs Increase by Themselves

Flour

Yesterday, the current market situation is still brewing. Customer transactions seem to be more active than in the previous two days. The Beiyang Gang is stable with Tianjin Shenhui, and the sporadic demand has increased slightly, but the whole ticket to dissolve it is still difficult to start. The Nanyang Gang is also nervous with the Shantou situation, and the entry is not strong, but the retail transactions on the street are lively. The situation in the concession in this port is becoming more and more tense, and the rice price is rising step by step, and people are inevitably terrified. There is a derivative relationship in the food category, so yesterday the 2nd flour mill still required 4 yuan and 5 and a half cents in cash, and even showed a firm state. The total market transaction continued at around 40,000 packages, and the market remained in the local office.

Wheat

Wheat is slightly tighter. Since the foreign wheat orders have arrived in Shanghai, the impact on the local wheat has been slight. For example, Jiangbei wheat is only sold for 6 yuan one or two corners, and the factory does not accept it. However, Japanese merchants and North China sales are still called cicadas, and the market has been greatly affected. Yesterday, I heard that the asking price for this wheat was higher, and because the rice price was rising, people were uneasy, and the food seemed to be optimistic. However, the factory customers needed it, and they were all indifferent, and the market presented a local office.

Export

Since the 9/18 Incident, the shipping industry between this city and the Zhuangzhuang has been monopolized. Therefore, the foreign merchant ships that run to Niuzhuang have also been suspended. There are only irregular ships that run. Yesterday, a British merchant ship loaded 12,000 packages of flour and transported it to Niuzhuang. I heard that the flour was reported and loaded by a certain national merchant. Under the current circumstances, I don't know what kind of relationship the British ship can load this cargo. Today, 14,330 packages of flour will be transported to Fuzhou.

### Finance. Major Investors Observing, Gold Market Steadfast

Yesterday, the cash gold futures market showed no momentum, resulting in a slight increase. Prices fluctuated between 2,128 and 2,129 throughout the day. It is believed that various parties harbor doubts and anxieties about the current market environment, leading major investors to adopt a wait-and-see approach, awaiting a shift in the situation before making decisions. Furthermore, strict security measures in the British and French concessions made cash transfers inconvenient. Therefore, only a small number of short covering transactions enlivened the market, totaling less than 300 taels for the entire day. Gold jewelry prices remained unchanged, customs gold remained stable, while Chinese and English pure gold saw slight increases.

Futures Up Only Two Yuan

From the morning, each bar (ten taels) saw a prolonged period of quiet in the market. Trading only commenced at 10:15 AM, with silversmiths buying 50 taels from money changers at 2,130 yuan, 3 yuan higher than the previous close. Soon after, silversmiths sold 50 taels to money changers at the same price as the morning opening. Subsequently, the market turned sluggish again. However, sellers still showed interest. Around 11:00 AM, money changers sold 50 taels to a gold shop at [missing value] yuan, showing a flat and weak trend. Later, silversmiths mutually traded 50 taels at 28 yuan as the midday closing price. In the afternoon, strict security measures in the French Concession, along with similar measures in the British Concession, made physical cash transfers inconvenient. Consequently, major investors remained on the sidelines, and trading became even quieter. Only money changers were seen mutually trading 30 taels at 29 yuan. The market remained stable, and the late closing price remained at 2,129 yuan. The result was a two-yuan increase compared to the previous night's close. The difference for the entire day was only two yuan. The selling price of cash shops' own-brand gold was 2,135 yuan, and the buying price was 2,125 yuan. The current standard gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with little actual business.

Jewelry Gold Remains Stable

The exchange price for jewelry gold per tael at silversmiths remained unchanged. Ta Tung Hang still quoted 217 yuan, while Sin Tung Hang quoted 215 yuan for selling and 209 yuan for buying.

English Pure Gold Increases Slightly

London, 18th - English pure gold suddenly increased by half a point, reaching £7 8s 6d per ounce. As a result, the Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese cash also rose to 1,212.30 yuan. The listed customs gold remained stable at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also increased by 40 cents to 1,207.60 yuan.

### Hong Kong Exchange Slightly Tight, Spot Exchange Stable for English and US Currencies, Easier for Futures

Yesterday, although foreign firms frequently sought to acquire spot exchange, plentiful supply from other sources kept the situation stable and unchanged. Sassoon, a Western firm, even made offers to sell. As for futures, foreign banks were increasingly willing to sell, and the Chinese firm Guohua also suddenly started selling. Although foreign firms (acting for Japanese firms and the Tianjin group) were buying, the position still felt ample, and the situation continued to show a stable to firm trend with active trading. The Hong Kong exchange rate appeared slightly tight and soft because foreign banks' appetite to sell was not very strong.

In the early morning, the London large bills for both near and far terms narrowed by 0.0625. The New York silver price remained unchanged. London raw gold increased by half a point. The exchange rates for English versus US, Shanghai, and French currencies remained stable. The rates for US versus English, Shanghai, and French currencies were all half. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling prices for spot exchange at banks were 8 1/4 pence for English currency and 16.0625 yuan for US currency, unchanged from the previous night's close. After the opening, foreign firms first settled spot English currency with HSBC and Banque Belge at 8 1/4 pence. Then, they bought spot US currency from Netherlands Bank and Banque Belge at 16.0625 yuan. Because supply and demand were balanced, there were no changes. Then, HSBC's listed rates were announced, and there was no change. The silver equalization tax was announced at slightly over 2%, calculated as 5.25%. Later, foreign firms settled spot English currency from Sassoon, a Western firm, at 8 1/4 pence. At that time, the Chinese firm Guohua suddenly sold US currency for the current month to Ewo (acting for Japanese firms and the Tianjin group) at 16.0625 yuan. Then, Ewo bought July US currency from Banca Italiana di Sconto at 15.875 yuan. Later, a foreign bank sold July English currency to Banque de l'Indochine at 8.15625 pence. The market trend was stable to firm. Nearing noon, trading in both English and US currencies became scarce. Only Hong Kong exchange was traded, with foreign firm Anda buying from Chinese speculators at a spot price of 55.375 yuan. Later, a Chinese firm strongly bought from Netherlands Bank at a spot price of only 55.25 yuan, showing a softening trend. At the midday close, bank selling prices for spot exchange in English and US currencies were similar to the morning opening. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 55.25 yuan.

In the afternoon market, foreign firms continued to first settle spot US currency at 16.0625 yuan with Banque Belge. Then, they settled spot English currency at 8 1/4 pence with Netherlands Bank. The situation remained largely unchanged. Later, foreign firms bought current month exchange at 16.03125 yuan from Banque Belge and Macgarity. The situation was also stable. There were no reported transactions for Hong Kong exchange, but the bank selling price remained at 55.25 yuan. At the late close, bank spot prices were 8.08125 pence for English currency and 16.0625 yuan for US currency. The result was that spot prices for both English and US currencies remained stable compared to the previous day's late close. Futures remained stable to firm. The Hong Kong exchange rate tightened by 0.0125.

### Three Major Leaks in Foreign Exchange

Foreign exchange is limited. Although there is control, the 8-penny exchange rate can still be freely accessed. Thus, it is far from being controlled. Currently, the biggest leaks in consumer goods are foreign wheat, foreign flour, and foreign cotton. It is even more unfortunate that there may be large remittances for foreign rice in the future. In addition, the Shanghai people's extravagant consumption of various foreign goods is even greater than before the war. If you don't believe it, look at the goods displayed in the shops. What's more, there are even bigger leaks. It is regrettable that such precious foreign exchange is being wasted!

### Tianjin English and US Exchange Rates Increase

In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms were actively settling accounts, and the supply from foreign banks was smooth, so the market was stable and lacking changes. In the gold futures market, gold shops' buying interest was strong, and the market situation was firm. Later, the supply from money changers was slightly smoother, and the market price fluctuated and softened. In the afternoon, supply and demand were balanced, and trading was scarce. The fluctuations throughout the day were narrow. The need for foreign currencies, English and US gold pounds, increased slightly, and they rose slightly. English and US gold tickets fell slightly due to the easing of forward exchange rates and abundant supply. Hong Kong tickets rose slightly due to the potentially weak exchange rate and tight supply.

### Yarn and Cotton: Hand Goods Sold in Competition, Cotton Yarn Price Drops Intensify, Double Horse and Heavenly Maiden Fall Another Seven Yuan, Chips Suddenly Over Supplied

The cotton yarn market is in steep decline, due to the poor environment, weak real demand, and increasingly pessimistic sentiment. Many with inventory are trying to sell their hand goods quickly, while traders are unwilling to buy. The market is increasingly oversupplied, and prices are falling. In the last two days, there has been a sharp drop of ten yuan. The 20-count Double Horse has broken the 420 yuan level. However, it is doubtful whether the resumption of transportation from Eastern Zhejiang will lead to yarn and cloth purchases. In the afternoon, there were very few people at the market, and trading was even more sluggish. Roadblocks set up by the concession authorities were dense. The closing price for Double Horse receipts broke 410 yuan.

Regarding the situation of current yarn, the market opened in the morning with a bleak atmosphere, poor sentiment, and sluggish trading. Even customers were at a loss. Brokers shouted in the market, asking if there was any business for variable-mark yarn. Yarn shops sent tickets to current goods users, eager to sell. Due to the inconvenience of transportation in the concession, they even transported the yarn to the docks themselves, and were willing to sell at a lower price. The opening price for Double Horse ticketed current goods was 419 yuan, the price for current goods outside the warehouse was 420 yuan, and the receipt price started at 414.5 yuan, later 413 yuan. Shortly after, only Guangbang Wanxing, acting on behalf of the Hong Kong gang, made purchases. Otherwise, there was no activity. The selling trend was very strong, and the market price continued to decline. Some large investors, seeing the poor trend, also remained on the sidelines. Suddenly, the price of Double Horse current goods fell to 417 yuan, and the receipt price was 410 yuan. The afternoon opening was average, with just over 100 bales traded, all by traders. The price of Double Horse current goods fell another yuan to 416.5 yuan, and the receipt price was 409 yuan. It was found that a total of 925 bales were purchased by various gangs. The market price for Double Horse fell by seven yuan, Heavenly Maiden also fell by seven yuan, Double Globe fell by six yuan, and 10-count Special Jincheng fell by two yuan. Today, 290 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Fuzhou, and another 120 pieces were shipped to Tianjin. The amount purchased by each gang is listed below:

Hong Kong 330 Yunnan 35

Traders 495 Inland 60

Wenzhou 3 Total 923

The market for Japanese yarn is in steep decline, with a tendency to fall sharply, due to the lack of current sales. The closing price for 20-count Moon Lyre yarn was 351 yuan, a drop of 10 yuan compared to the previous day.

### The Atmosphere in Northern Cotton Yarn Market is Crazy, Just Like the South

Shanghai people have not heard from the northern cotton yarn market for a long time. Here is some information about the cotton yarn situation in Tianjin brought by a friend. Although it is from the previous day, it is valuable in this situation.

(1) The Tianjin cotton market has been very hot recently, and prices have reached a record high, the highest peak in the history of the North China cotton market. The price of fine lint cotton has risen from over 60 yuan to 77 yuan, which is two yuan higher than the highest price last year. The reasons for the sharp rise are nothing more than short supply, stimulation from yarn prices, and the depreciation of counterfeit currency.

(2) The amount of cotton in each warehouse in the city is only about 80,000 to 90,000 bales. This amount is not enough to supply the cotton mills in Tianjin for three months. Now it is only mid-March in the lunar calendar, and the cotton-growing area is still in the sowing season. It is impossible to predict the bumper harvest or shortage of new cotton this year. Even if a bumper harvest is expected, there is still half a year before the harvest season. In this situation, if the cotton mills have no raw materials to supply during the lean season, they will inevitably stop working. Therefore, in order to consider future work issues, the cotton mills must purchase in the market in advance as a precaution. Therefore, each cotton mill is diligently collecting, and at the same time, general hoarders, seeing that the future is profitable, are entrusting cotton warehouses to purchase on their behalf. Even if the selling price increases, they do not hesitate, only seeking to get the goods. The current goods circulating in the market have been absorbed, and the bottom goods are increasingly scarce, so the market price is like a raging horse galloping.

(3) The source of cotton in Tianjin has always been mainly the Xihe and Yuhe areas. Now the source of the two rivers is still as rare as morning stars. The goods shipped by Yuhe feel very lacking, and all have been searched and exhausted by cotton merchants going to the countryside. Therefore, the arrival of goods is not strong. The cost price of goods stored by inland farmers has increased significantly, and the rising power of cotton prices in Tianjin is stronger. The above reasons all make the cotton market rise. (A)

### Foreign Cotton Prices Continue to Rise, Manufacturers Temporarily Stop Ordering

Foreign cotton prices: the New York cotton market is very firm. Although the transaction volume has not increased in recent days, there is a rare shortage of spot goods on the market. There is still no news of the government's loan cotton being released. The new cotton will be launched in August. If the loan cotton is not released in mid-June or July during this lean season, it will create a panic. However, the government is now preparing to release cotton successively when cotton prices rise a certain amount, so that it can also clear a large number of warehouses and replenish the national treasury. Yesterday, New York rose by 9 to 11 pounds, and the April-May white Lok region in India has created a new high price of 172. Egyptian cotton was stable. Converting to legal currency, US cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 8 cents per picul, Indian cotton rose by 4 cents, and Egyptian cotton did not move.

In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, manufacturers both Chinese and foreign have temporarily stopped ordering due to the continuous rise in overseas cotton markets, which has resulted in too high cotton prices. Moreover, a large amount of Japanese foreign cotton has arrived in recent days, and the minds of all traders have also become indifferent. If New York falls back 30 pounds or Indian cotton falls back 10 rupees, the foreign cotton trade can be restored to its previous prosperity. Here are yesterday's market prices for cotton delivered to factories, converted to legal currency.

Raw Material Category Delivery to Factory Including Tax

60-count Egyptian cotton Premium 108.65

Ditto Medium 105.70

80-count Ditto Premium 39.10

24-count Indian Bodi 86.50

32/42-count American Kindred 90.10

The domestic cotton raw material market has developed slightly in the last two days, but yesterday it entered a stagnant and dull trend again. Although factories are accepting goods, the goods are scarce and it is very difficult to find them, so the intentions of each factory are uniformly shifted to foreign cotton. However, in recent days, foreign cotton prices have risen daily, and the purchase prices are also expensive. There are very few sources of supply from northern Jiangsu, only 128 bales. Here is the current situation of cotton.

180 bales Cash, warehouse delivery

200 pieces Ditto

300 pieces Ditto

### Securities: Unsettled Situation, Foreign Stock Still Firm, Domestic Debt Market Somewhat Erratic

Yesterday's situation on the securities gray market suddenly suffered a setback due to rumors in the local market. However, because the situation was unclear, people became flustered and cautious, and the short sellers did not dare to increase their positions rashly. The weak market price was still supportable, but the trading was scarce and the fluctuations were even smaller. This kind of brewing situation cannot last for a long time. There will be greater turbulence today. Looking back on yesterday, the selling pressure was initially stronger, and a number of long positions in Tiansheng, Tongkang, Lianhe, and Hengzi, etc. were liquidated, resulting in a decline of 3-4 cents. Later, Runli, Datong, Yongfeng, Tongde, etc. absorbed, and the price rose slightly, only slightly weaker than the previous day. The situation in the afternoon was stable to weak, and trading was very quiet. Both buyers and sellers were very idle. Although there were many rumors, there was no way to confirm them, and the market continued to see small movements. This situation makes people feel that the situation has not become less serious, people are uneasy, and the market price is not easy to rise again. The result was a slight drop of 0.05 to 0.20 yuan, and the total transaction volume was only more than 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.

Category High Low Closing Change from Previous Day

Unified Class A 60.85 60.55 60.80 Down 0.05

Unified Class B 53.80 53.60 53.60 Ditto 0.10

Unified Domestic 51.85 51.40 51.80 Ditto 0.10

Unified Class D 51.50 51.30 51.50 Ditto 0.15

Unified Class E 51.85 51.50 51.80 Ditto 0.20

96 6.55 6.0 6.55 Ditto 0.05

There were no transactions in Chinese stocks. According to the report from the public association, foreign stocks were firm due to the improved political situation, but trading still did not seem to be broad. Investors continued to buy tram stocks, with a transaction price of 39 yuan, and Kowheong stocks with a buying price of 197 yuan. The Ruirong stock was stable and did not seem to change, with a price of 7.85 yuan, but the Jaysons stock was slightly weak because the company's interim dividend for 1939 was only 4 yuan, and some people thought it was too small. Telephone stocks were calm after the recent surge, with a price of 99 yuan. Jardine stocks did not fluctuate much, with a closing buying price of 18.70 yuan. Company bonds were trending weakly. The 5.5% electricity bonds had supply and demand at a price of 88 yuan. Rubber stocks were potentially firm and rising, but the difference between the buying price and the selling price was too large, and the transaction volume was extremely small.

The board of directors of the British-owned Jaysons Shipyard (i.e., Old Dockyard) Co., Ltd. decided yesterday to pay an interim dividend of 4 yuan per share in national currency for 1939, which will be distributed at the beginning of next month.

The listed prices of the stocks of various Far East companies of the British-owned London on the 18th of this month (Thursday) showed that only the Gula Rong Lin Rubber stock rose by 7 1/2 pence to a price of 18 shillings 9 pence, and the rest did not change.

The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt in London on the 18th of this month (Thursday) showed that only the British debt notes for the Post-War Reconstruction Loan rose by half a pound to a price of 52 1/2 pounds, and the rest did not change. There was a sale of £5,000 in British notes for the Post-War Reconstruction Loan, with a sale price of 53 pounds, half a pound higher than the market price, and £7,000 in Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway public bonds, with a sale price of 19 1/2 pounds, in line with the market price.

### Piece Goods: Eastern Cloth Suffers a Terrible Fall, Domestic Cloth is Quiet in Spot Sales

Domestic Cloth

Yesterday, spot sales in all sectors were uniformly sluggish. The local market was disturbed by rumors, and the weather was not hot enough for summer goods to be at their peak selling season. Therefore, transactions in the market were also sluggish. However, wholesale transactions in Chinese and Western clothing held up well. There were no major rises or falls in prices. Among white goods, the Dahpeng and Fugui fine cloth produced by textile factories such as Yong'an and Shenxin were the most stable. Guangdong and Eastern Zhejiang Wenzhou and Shaoxing gangs bought 40 to 50 packages of specified brands, while fine cloth twill produced by pure weaving factories was affected by the sharp fall in Eastern cloth, and market prices continued to decline. Dyeing factories disliked the high prices and did not use them. Guangdong and Wenzhou gangs bought 50 to 60 pieces, with prices falling by about 10 cents per piece. The Wenzhou and Shaoxing gangs continued to buy nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth/coarse twill. The local market and Wenzhou and Shaoxing gangs continued to buy nearly 100 pieces, with prices continuing to loosen by 5 to 10 cents per piece. Local customers were reluctant to buy bleached and dyed cloth, and only a few transactions were made. The number of dyeing factories in the local market that have stopped work has increased to more than a dozen.

Eastern Cloth

The decline in white goods has not stopped and is moving downstream. Yesterday, the leading fine cloth plunged 30 to 40 cents, selling for 13.05 to 13.10 yuan. Traders replenished their positions in the after market, and the price slowly rose again to 13.40 yuan. Futures for next month traded at 13.45 to 13.50 yuan, and people's hearts began to stabilize slightly. However, colored goods such as serge and zhigong continued to fall, and traders were very panicked. For example, the low price of Four Gentlemen's serge yesterday fell to 0.115 yuan per yard, which is a sharp drop of 8 cents per yard compared to the peak of 0.495 yuan. The difference is 2.40 yuan per piece.

Exports

On the 20th, 65 pieces of piece goods were exported to Tianjin, 35 pieces to Yantai, and 25 pieces to Fuzhou. The Linping cocoon market has opened, and transportation costs are quite high.

### Silk and Tea: Foreign Silk Turns Downstream, Shanghai Silk Shows No Improvement, Linping Cocoon Market Has Opened, Transportation Costs Are Quite High

The foreign silk market has turned downstream in the last two days. Yesterday, the US and Japanese markets fell again. Yokohama spot fell by 22 yuan, and futures fell by 19 yuan. New York recently fell by 5 cents, and futures fell by 4.5 cents. Shanghai silk 78 points fell by 4 cents, Japanese silk 83 points fell by 3 cents, and 75 points fell by 4 cents. Local American sales still show no improvement. French silk prices continued to fall by 10 yuan to 20 yuan. The B-character Bai factory traded at 1,780-1,800 yuan yesterday. Only Kelly & Walsh bought 40 bundles. India's Jili silk was traded slightly yesterday, and silk prices were firm, with 10 bundles traded.

According to news from Hangzhou, the cocoon market in the Linping area opened the day before yesterday. However, due to the poor harvest and many difficulties, the price of local fresh cocoons has risen from 40 yuan to 60 yuan, and the price of foreign fresh cocoons has risen from 60 yuan to 80 yuan (both per dan). It is difficult to make the cocoon collection method public. However, based on factual speculation, it seems to be more inconvenient in the occupied areas, and most of the guerrilla areas can set up cocoon collection points. However, transportation still needs someone to arrange it. Generally speaking, the shipping cost of fresh cocoons from the mainland to Shanghai is 40 yuan per dan, including several "taxes" of unknown name and water feet commissions. The silk cocoon market in Suzhou and Wuxi and other towns near the Yangtze River will also open soon. The "China Central Company" can only engage in cocoon collection in the urban area of Wuxi and the two districts in the west of the city. The same is true in Suzhou. In other areas, the guerrillas provide protection, and the information on cocoons has not been suppressed. The Shanghai-Hangzhou line is relatively bad, and because it was impossible to collect cocoons there the year before last, the amount of silkworms raised this spring has been greatly reduced. It is said that in general, there is only 1/10 to 2/10 of the annual yield. The Beijing-Shanghai area has less impact, but it is only about half of the year before last.

### Oil Cakes: Raw Soybean Oil Rises Again

Yesterday's raw soybean oil market continued the good image of the previous day. Tens of thousands of chips in the market have gradually been transferred, and half of the new remaining amount has been hoarded by the multi-head company, so the appetite for trading has been slightly active in the last two days, and the chips are suddenly tightening. Market prices continue to rise. 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil have been traded at a price of 30 yuan, which is 1 yuan higher than the previous day. Dalian barrel raw oil has to rise by 1.5 yuan, and the price is 40 yuan. 40 barrels were traded. Soybean oil has become a compromise. 350 pieces of Yantai oil, 50 pieces of Qingdao oil, 50 pieces of Dalian large baskets, 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, 300 barrels of Dalian barrel oil, and 30 barrels of Fengnian oil have been traded, and the market prices are generally 0.5 to 1 yuan higher than before.

Today, 880 packages of soybeans were shipped to Xinghua, and 5,600 pieces of bean cakes were also shipped to Xinghua.

### Sugar Market: Sugar Trading Quiet

Yesterday's sugar market was quiet because London loosened again, with the cable saying that it fell by 3/4 for August, to 7s 0 1/4 pence; fell by 1/2 for December, to 6s 1 1/2 pence; fell by 3/4 for March of next year, to 6s 2 pence. In the local association's board, 24 coarse white, the current cargo of this warehouse, a little less than half a dime, traded 80 bags at 27.175 yuan; the goods in the outer warehouse were called for a little less than a dime, and transshipment goods were called for 19 yuan; Taikoo car white was also a little less than half a dime; the existing CW marks were withdrawn as usual; Dutch red and local cotton white were all called for the original price, and few transactions were made. National sugar was also weak, and most of the banks went in and out with the market, and the transactions were even rarer. However, according to the news from Guyu, the price of green products has risen. On the 20th, 120 packages of sugar came from Yantai.

### North and South Goods: White Lotus Goods on the Way

White lotus had no source because the Yongou shipping route was cut off. It was found that the stocks on the market were thin, and they had been sold to 110 yuan. Now it has been sold out. According to the letter from the producing area yesterday, the Jinli area was bombed and recently calmed down a little. A small number of goods have been loaded and are on the way and will be transferred to Shanghai from Wenzhou. Now that the Shanghai bottom has been emptied, the market will inevitably continue to increase.

### Seafood: Yantai Dried Scallops, New Goods on the Way

Yantai dried scallops were sold out early by industry insiders, resulting in a quiet market. Now that the new season is approaching, a message has been received from the producing area that the first batch of goods is being shipped and will arrive in Shanghai soon.

### Metals New Lead Wire Market Also Weak

The metal trade has been sluggish recently due to slow sales to merchants from various regions, coupled with increasingly tense international and Shanghai situations. Demand for metal products from factories in this area is not as strong as in previous weeks. Consequently, sales of various metal products have weakened slightly. Products like white lead sheet, original factory nails, road sheet iron, flat white iron, yellow steel wire, angle iron, and black iron sheet are all weaker than before. Therefore, the new lead wire market is no exception. Only a few hundred bundles were sold yesterday. Standard prices are as follows: #16 to #20 sold for 35 yuan, #21 to #25 sold for 45 yuan, and single-strand fancy wire sold for 65 yuan. This is a drop of 5 to 10 yuan compared to the previous golden age.

### Coal Indian Coal Sells Immediately Upon Arrival

Although Indian bituminous coal has been arriving continuously, the city has been short of stock for a long time. Any arriving goods are quickly purchased, leading to a trend of immediate sales upon arrival. Yesterday, a certain firm received over 7,000 tons, and half of it has already been taken by other firms. According to the manifest, Indian standard coal is priced at 39.25 yuan per ton, screened lumps at 41 yuan, and small pieces at 40 yuan. Transferring from the ship reduces the price by 0.50 yuan. Delivery to customers' gates adds 4 yuan to the price.

The baggage allowance for passengers on flights from Hong Kong to Chongqing was originally 15 kilograms, with excess baggage charges. Due to an excessive volume of airmail, restrictions have been imposed, changing the allowance to only 5 kilograms per passenger, with no exceptions.

Qinling Highway Widening

The Qinling section of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway has been widened due to the narrow roadbed, which caused traffic inconveniences and frequent incidents of vehicles falling into ditches. Construction has started to widen the section by 2 meters, with an estimated cost of 150,000 yuan. The project is expected to be completed in about four weeks, which will greatly benefit travelers.

Guangxi-Vietnam Border Railway

The Nanning Railway in Guangxi Province is part of the Xiang-Gui Railway, with a total length of 250 kilometers. The section from Dong Dang in Vietnam to Zhennanguan, which is 5 kilometers long, has been completed. The opening ceremony was held on the 4th of this month, and trains will officially start running soon. The entire project is also actively underway.

### Luggage Issues When Traveling by Ship

— Jing

Anyone who travels, whether for business or leisure, naturally needs to bring personal belongings. The amount of luggage depends on each individual's preference. Therefore, common modes of transportation, such as airplanes, cars, trains, and ships, have regulations on the amount of luggage allowed to avoid passengers carrying too much. This issue is quite complex. Here are some luggage issues related to ship travel reported to our readers.

Regardless of the shipping company, the amount of luggage passengers can bring for free is determined by their cabin class, level, and distance of travel. These limits vary by shipping company. If the amount of luggage a passenger carries exceeds the limit, the shipping company will charge an excess luggage fee in accordance with the regulations. The fee is very high. While this is generally understood, those with little travel experience may overlook this before boarding and bring large amounts of luggage, even household furniture and unnecessary items. They may find that the excess baggage fee they must pay is even higher than the original value of the items they brought (such as old iron bed frames, wicker baskets, and bulky furniture). At this point, paying the fee according to the shipping company's regulations feels exorbitant, but abandoning the luggage on the spot is impossible, putting them in a difficult situation.

The regulations for free luggage and excess luggage vary depending on the shipping company, especially on the Shanghai to Hong Kong route, where many companies operate ships of various nationalities. Generally speaking, American President Lines and Chang Xing Company allow each first-class passenger 40 cubic feet or 350 pounds of free luggage. Second- and third-class passengers can bring 20-30 cubic feet or 175-250 pounds of free luggage. Exceeding this limit costs US$0.15 per cubic foot or US$0.015 per pound. Luggage is measured by weight or volume, depending on which is greater. Other shipping companies from England, France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands have similar regulations, and their fees are similarly high.

Therefore, if you plan to travel and bring a lot of luggage, it's best to inquire with the shipping company or travel agency beforehand to get an estimate and avoid complications later. Also, shipping companies consider suitcases, briefcases, bedding, and essential travel items as luggage. However, large items such as new statues, pianos, refrigerators, or objects packed with bamboo strips or wooden boards that cannot be opened are considered cargo. When carrying these items, they should be formally declared and shipped, or a "Permit to Ship" should be obtained from customs before sending them to the ship. There are also fees for bringing pets like cats, dogs, and birds, which are quite high. It is important to note that shipping companies have different luggage tags for items to be carried on board (Wanted) and items to be stored in the hold (Not Wanted). Small items needed during the trip can be tagged "Wanted" to be placed in the cabin for easy access. Other bulky and less necessary luggage can be tagged "Not Wanted" and stored in the luggage hold. For the convenience of passengers, the shipping company opens the luggage hold at a specific time each day for passengers to check or retrieve items. Therefore, unnecessary luggage can be stored in the luggage hold to make the cabin more spacious.

### The Latest Eight-Horsepower Austin Model

To meet global needs, the British Austin Motor Company has recently released a new eight-horsepower Austin model. Its size is similar to the ten-horsepower Austin, but its price is much lower. It is also very fuel-efficient, combining the comfort of the ten-horsepower Austin with the economy of the seven-horsepower Austin. It is reported that Jiuwei Automobile Company at 100 Meyer Xi'ai Road in this city has received a sample six-window four-door sedan of this eight-horsepower Austin model. A large shipment is on its way. It is also reported that the manufacturer has decided to stop producing the original seven-horsepower small Austin.

### Renault Automobile Inventory to Sell Out Soon

The batch of 1939 Renault small cars recently arrived at Fada Automobile Company at 424 Route Haig. They have been well-received by the automotive industry due to their exquisite design and fuel efficiency, and sales have been excellent. It is reported that the current stock is nearly sold out. The next batch of new cars is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon. However, due to cost reasons, the prices will increase slightly. The current inventory will still be sold at the original price to show preferential treatment.

### Travel Q&A

Mr. Shi Jingyao asked about the situation of going from Shanghai to Tianjin.

(Answer) 1. All Taikoo and Jardine Matheson ships dock at Tanggu, and then take a train to Tianjin. (Passengers in deluxe cabins will be transported by the company's own small steamers). The Xin'anna of Weili Han Company can go directly to Zizhu Lin. 2. Suits and other clothing can be brought, but legal tender is inconvenient. You can exchange it for Japanese gold or prepare banknotes from the Preparatory Bank to bring with you in Shanghai.

Mr. Shi Peizhi asked about the situation of going to Hong Kong.

(Answer) 1. The lowest fare for ships from Taikoo and Jardine Matheson from Shanghai to Hong Kong is 20 yuan in national currency. The lowest fare for postal ships is 50 yuan. 2. The recent fare from Hong Kong to Kunming via Vietnam is approximately 46 yuan in national currency.

Mr. Jin Jianqiu asked about the situation of going to Fujian and Guangdong:

(Answer) 1. The fare to Hong Kong is 50 yuan in national currency for company ship officer cabins and 20 yuan for steerage. The second-class fare for postal ships is £6 or US$25. The third-class fare is £3 or US$12. There is no problem bringing new clothes to Hong Kong. 2. There are no concessions in Shantou. To go from Shantou to Sanheba, you can first take a train to Chaozhou and then go by road or by small steamship (operated by Chinese merchants). 3. The steamships between Fuzhou and Yanping are also operated by Chinese merchants. 4. There is no problem bringing necessary books to Hong Kong or Fujian.

Messrs. Zhu Fuliang, Lu Yimin, Chen Zhenyu, Yang Ji, He Renlong, and Wang Yiwen asked about the situation in Lishui, Yongkang, and Yiwu in eastern Zhejiang:

(Answer) First take a ship from Shanghai to Wenzhou, and then take a civilian boat to Lishui, which takes two days. Then take a car to Yongkang, which takes three hours. The lowest cost for the entire journey is more than 20 yuan. 2. After arriving in Lishui, you can take a car to Jinhua, which takes five hours. You can also take the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway train to Yiwu, or take a highway bus from Yongkang directly. 3. To go to Dongyang, you can go directly from Yongkang. The bus fare is about 4 yuan and takes 6 hours. 4. You must have a local shop guarantee to land in Wenzhou.

Messrs. Wang Jinyu, Yang Yang, Hu Fanzhong, Xu Jilin, Zhu Zuli, and Hu Hanzhang asked about the recent transportation situation to the interior:

(Answer) It is no longer possible to go to the interior through Wenzhou, Yuhua. But for those who want to save travel expenses and avoid going through Vietnam, there are still two routes available, but the journey is very difficult. One is to go through Shantou, then through Chaoyang, Xingning, and Longnan to reach Qujiang. It is said that this section of the highway has been damaged, but it can still be partially passable, costing more than 20 yuan. After arriving in Qujiang, take the Guangdong-Hankou Railway train to Hengyang, and then transfer to the interior. The other is to take a ship from Shanghai to Guangzhou Bay, with a minimum fare of 29 yuan, and then transfer to Yulin (this section of the highway has been interrupted, and passengers mostly travel in groups on foot or by sedan chair instead of cars, which takes more than two days). After arriving in Yulin, you can take the Guangxi Provincial Highway to Liuzhou, and then transfer to Qian and Shu. We do not recommend the above two routes. In short, the safest and most reliable route to the interior is still through Vietnam. This journal has repeatedly detailed the itinerary. Here is a summary of the most economical journey from Shanghai to various destinations upon inquiry:

Shanghai to Kunming, 95.09 yuan in national currency (steerage on ship, fourth class on train, food and lodging not included).

Shanghai to Guiyang, 88.19 yuan in national currency (same as above).

Shanghai to Qijiang, 106.29 yuan in national currency (same as above).

Shanghai to Chongqing, 112.59 yuan in national currency (same as above).

Mr. Chen Ling asked about the situation in Shenyang, Northeast China:

(Answer) To go from Shanghai to Shenyang, you can first take a Dalian Steamship Company ship to Dalian. The third-class fare is 18 Japanese gold. Then take a train from Dalian directly to Shenyang. The third-class fare is 6.15 Japanese gold. Before buying a ticket, you should first apply for a pass from the Japanese Consulate here before starting the journey. We cannot purchase the boat and train tickets on your behalf.

### About the Huxi Commune

— Jiaoren

—Some Supplements and Corrections—

After reading Mr. Ximon's article "The Huxi Commune" in the 17th issue of this journal, I felt that its content was not entirely accurate and needed to be supplemented. Based on my observations, I offer the following to this journal to present a more general picture.

Since the August 13th Incident, the Huxi Commune was closed for two months due to certain reasons. After several negotiations, it resumed operations in November of last year. Due to environmental restrictions, its facilities have been reduced compared to before the war: the small soccer goalposts and basketball hoops on the playground have also been removed. Apart from the slides for children, there is no other sports equipment or apparatus to be found in the sports field. As for the reading room, it no longer exists. Only one or two copies are kept for the staff to read, presumably to avoid "accidents"!

Under these difficult circumstances, the work of the Huxi Commune can be roughly divided as follows:

(1) Staff Children's Primary School - This was established entirely for those laborers working day and night in factories, so that their children could have the opportunity to receive an education. Tuition is low, at most three yuan.

(2) Destitute Children's Class - The Destitute Children's Class starts at 2 pm. The teachers are not graduates of normal schools, but students selected from the Staff Children's School who are excellent in both character and academics. They are implementing Mr. Tao Xingzhi's "Little Teacher System," and their performance is excellent. Tuition is completely free for the Destitute Children's Class, and books are also provided by the commune.

(3) Staff Evening Supplementary School - Divided into English and Chinese Arithmetic classes, classes are held from 7 pm to 9 pm. The students are all factory workers or shop apprentices. They use their spare time to improve their knowledge, giving them the opportunity to "work and study." Fees are also low.

(4) Free Clinic - From 2 pm to 5 pm every afternoon, doctors and nurses appointed by the Chinese Medical Association come to the commune to diagnose the illnesses of the poor. Only a registration fee of three cents is charged, and medical expenses are waived.

(5) Library - Currently limited to students, expansion is planned.

(6) Games Room - The large auditorium is equipped with two ping-pong tables as a games room, where Huxi workers can play ball and rest at any time. Although there are no ball racks on the playground, they can still play soccer, so more than a hundred people come to the commune to exercise every day.

(7) Sunday School - Every Sunday morning, teaching clergymen come to the commune to hold Sunday School, in which all students can participate.

(8) Public Bathhouse - During the height of summer, the bathhouse is open, and everyone can bathe for a small fee of two or three cents.

(9) People's Canteen - The People's Canteen, which is being prepared, will offer simple and hygienic dishes at low prices to solve the livelihood problems of the hard-working people in Huxi, and to eliminate various unsanitary food stalls on the streets.

(10) Other - Services such as smallpox vaccination and preventative injections for civilians are free of charge.

It is admirable that the Huxi Commune can continue to struggle and work hard in the harsh environment of Huxi, tirelessly organizing the various public welfare undertakings mentioned above. The perseverance of the organizers and the spirit of the members have immeasurably benefited the laboring class in Huxi.

### Perspectives on Shanghai's Flourishing Silver Shops

— (Bumin)

—A Conversation with Mr. Huang Yuqi—

On the 17th, this newspaper published an article about silver shops related to Li Qiuwu. Out of curiosity and a desire for knowledge, the reporter consulted Mr. Huang Yuqi, who was the first founder of silver shops in Shanghai and the head of the most well-funded and largest-scale silver shop, Huizhong. Following Mr. Huang's introduction, I interviewed several respected figures in the industry. They were all open and honest in providing me with a thorough understanding, which gave me a new perspective.

According to Mr. Huang, "The term 'silver shop' appeared before banks. In the past, they were government-run, but now they are commercially operated, so the organization and management methods are different from the past. China's economy is backward, and the majority of society is composed of the 'struggling merchants' described by Mr. Li, who do not have access to the benefits of banks and money shops. Therefore, silver shops came into being as financial organizations serving the general business community. Their current state of development proves that they are an urgent need in society."

"As for not requiring an introduction to open an account at a silver shop," Mr. Huang continued, "this is a necessary measure to implement the principle of serving the general public. However, this is not unique to silver shops. Several banks with millions of capital also do not require introductions for new accounts. I believe that as long as someone is a legitimate merchant, they should have the right to open an account. As for handling fees, ticket posting fees, and ledger fees, these are common rules in the silver and money industry and are legitimate sources of income in the profit and loss statements of the silver and money industry."

Regarding the issue of returned check fees, the reporter asked, "Does charging a 30-cent returned check fee seem inconsistent with the original purpose of serving small and medium-sized businesses?"

"Whether returned check fees should be charged is indeed a matter worth discussing in the practical operations of the silver and money industry. In theory and from the perspective of negotiable instruments law, checks involve capital relationships and should not be returned in the first place. However, in reality, due to the general lack of understanding of negotiable instruments among Chinese merchants, returned checks are unavoidable. In order to minimize returned checks, the silver and money industry has had to come up with a remedial measure. Some charge 50 cents, while others charge 30 cents. This is a passive countermeasure to deal with practical matters and is not a goal in itself. As for a certain silver shop having 300 returned checks per day, this is a joke. Regardless of whether this number is unfounded, such a phenomenon would never occur in reality."

The reporter then asked, "So, I also heard that thirteen yuan and a few cents were deposited for two years and nothing was left. Is this true?"

Mr. Huang replied earnestly, "Do you believe that?" "If this news is unfortunately true, then it would be an unprecedented scandal! But after a little rational consideration, I couldn't help but laugh. My guess is that the customer made deposits and payments by check based on the ledger, and the amounts recorded in the ledger were simply one-sided income figures. Perhaps there was a mistake made there."

After expressing satisfaction and gratitude, the reporter said goodbye, and Mr. Huang said enthusiastically:

"In short, the silver shop industry in China is in the midst of vigorous development. We sincerely welcome and are willing to accept sincere criticism and correction from all sectors."

Chapter 10: A Virtuous Mother with a Chignon and Green Skirt, A Lively Old Man with a Silver Beard and Emerald Sleeves

After lunch, Village Chief Zhu accompanied the two Miss Hes, as well as Zhu’s wife, Ai-ren, and Ai-qun, in the wife’s car. The five of them went to check out the site. Not far from Freedom Village, there was a canal with a wide surface and many boats coming and going. There were several plots of land there, all belonging to the village, and the highway ran along the canal, making it a good location for both water and land transportation. On the opposite bank were distant green hills and lush trees, resembling clusters of fishing villages and farmhouses. Village Chief Zhu said, "This side of the canal belongs to Freedom Village, and the other side does not belong to Freedom Village." He Shuangyu asked, "What is that place called?" Village Chief Zhu said, "That place is called Water Bamboo Village. The village chief's surname is Xu, and I know him. The man is over eighty years old this year." He Liyu thought to herself: Why are the so-called village chiefs here all old men? But she only thought about it and did not say it out loud. Village Chief Zhu continued, "This old Village Chief Xu is also quite something. He is truly a man who sacrificed his family to help the nation. Although he is a Water Bamboo Village resident, he is not a farmer. He went out to do business when he was young and did not live in the village. In his middle age, his business prospered, and he had several hundred thousand in assets. Later, he speculated in Shanghai and made a lot of money, immediately becoming a wealthy man. But he had no sons, nor even daughters. Actually, it doesn't matter if you don't have children, but the Chinese have always valued succession, and having no descendants is a major regret in life. At the time, many friends advised him to adopt a son or adopt a daughter. People knew that he was wealthy and were willing to give him their children, so that they could inherit his property in the future. But this old man was very stubborn and did not want anyone else's children. He also sensed that people wanted to give him their children for his wealth. So if they were not his own children, he would rather not have them, and preferred to be a lonely old man. At this time, his original wife had already died, and he had married two subsequent wives, who had also died. People advised him to take a concubine, but he said that he was old and would not harm anyone else's daughter in her youth. In fact, many people were willing to marry this old man, also for his wealth, knowing that he would not live much longer. After he died, they could enjoy themselves in peace, or remarry someone else. But the old man Xu refused. When the Chinese war came, the old man Xu was also over seventy years old. He donated all his property to the country, except for a portion that was in the occupied territories and could not be recovered at the time. He thought it through thoroughly: rather than letting it fall into the hands of who knows who, it is better to serve the country." (114)

### The Three Musketeers

— Yan Hua

“The 3 Musketeers”

A 20th Century Fox Production, Showing at the Grand Theater

Unveiling the struggles between the French royal family and the power of the Cardinal, Alexandre Dumas's "The Three Musketeers" is unforgettable. The bravery of the young swordsman D'Artagnan, the treachery of the Cardinal, and the loyalty of the Three Musketeers to the French King, are all sketched out by Dumas's pen, portraying heroes and beauties.

Reflected in films, we have seen the silent film era's Douglas Fairbanks starring in "The Three Musketeers" and "The Three Musketeers Continued." Then, in the sound era, the talking "The Three Musketeers" followed, in which amidst the clanging of swords, D'Artagnan's rendezvous with the maid Constance, the Queen's anxiety when the brooch had not yet arrived for the ball, and the Cardinal's shock when he saw the brooch on the Queen's chest before the King—these are all dramatic materials. No wonder Hollywood seizes them and refuses to let go, repeatedly filming "The Three Musketeers."

This "Three Musketeers" film makes the Three Stooges create as many laughs as possible, so it has been slightly altered from the original. For example, D'Artagnan used to go to London to retrieve the brooch from the French Duke, encountering many dangers along the way, but now D'Artagnan only steals the brooch from the Duchess de Winter, who stole it from the Duke. Many dangerous scenes have been omitted here.

Speaking of the altered parts, although it is not as tense as the previous "Three Musketeers," its comedic atmosphere is indeed quite lovely.

Beneath the humorous cartoonishness, the Three Stooges, wearing the "Three Musketeers" hat and sword, seem much more clever because they have a dramatic story like "The Three Musketeers" to work with, rather than just messing around and staring blankly while making strange noises as before.

In terms of performance effects, the entire film is quite exciting and funny. Its better scenes include the following:

(1) D'Artagnan, impersonating the Cardinal, drives a six-horse carriage towards Paris with the maid Constance—the atmosphere and use of the camera in this scene are excellent. The posture of the six horses galloping on the country road, the horseshoes flying in the low-angle shot, the Cardinal's guards on horseback coming from the sky, the coachman leaving the driver's seat, D'Artagnan climbing from the rear of the carriage to the front seat, and then lunging onto the horse's back to grab the reins... The contrasting techniques make this scene reach the expected climax.

(2) Before the Queen goes to the ball, she has not yet received the diamond brooch, but when she and the King bow to other noblewomen, a hand reaches out from behind the curtain, holding a shining diamond brooch ("close-up": the Queen takes the brooch), the Queen calmly stands in front of the Cardinal... Slowly removing her feathered fan, her chest reveals the brooch that shocks the Cardinal...

Don Ameche plays D'Artagnan. His singing and swordsmanship are brave enough, but also just barely passable. The Three Stooges' copper drum dance, with cymbals all over their bodies, makes the audience laugh out loud when the three of them dance.

However, there is one irredeemable regret in the whole film: the real "Three Musketeers" appear, but after being drunk, they disappear and the Three Stooges mess around until the end. This is an irreparable loophole.

The actor playing the Cardinal is not treacherous and cunning enough. Lionel Atwill has too few scenes and cannot show his talents.

The Three Stooges' very nonsensical scenes reduce the more reasonable humorous scenes interspersed, such as stretching their backs after riding horses, and pretending to be the Cardinal's son and interrupting the guards, allowing D'Artagnan to enter the palace. These are much more pleasing than the purely blind noise of the past.

Entertainment World

### Talking About Yuan Yuandan and Gai Jiaotian

— Zhang Guyu

Yuan Yuandan was the top student of the Fu Liancheng troupe. His original name was Gao Xiyu. He played both female roles, martial roles, and acrobatic female roles. Although his appearance was not beautiful, his waist and leg skills were solid, and his stability was unparalleled. He came to Shanghai in the second year of the Republic and gained a great reputation. The following autumn, he returned north and joined the Shuangqing Society at the invitation of Yu Zhenting, performing at the Wenming Garden. His performances were often the main attraction. The supporting actors were all his fellow students, such as Zhong Xijiu, Hou Xirui, Chen Xide, Guo Xifang, and Guo Xiqing. The playbill also included the words "Newly Returned from Shanghai," which showed how grand the situation was.

Gai Jiaotian was from Gaoyang, Hebei. His original name was Zhang Yingjie. His art was based on Li Chunlai, steady and dignified. In his early years, he was excellent in relying on his voice, and his play "The Attack on Zidu" once dominated the stage. In his middle age, he switched to short, action-packed plays. Jiao Qingli, Li Deshan, Tan Yongkui, and Qi Caifen were all good partners for Gai. In the early years of the Republic, his momentum was strongest. In the winter of the fourth year of the Republic, he returned to his hometown to visit relatives. He passed through Beiping and was retained by Yu Zhenting, performing at Jixiang. The first day's repertoire was "The Four Heroes Village," listed after Mei Lanfang and Wang Fengqing's "Fenhe Bay" (Mei was very popular at this time). Yu Zhenting and Zhu Guifang's "Attack on Tongguan" was fourth from the bottom, which was actually the most glorious page in the history of the southern stage. Now, Yuan Yuandan cannot gain a foothold in Tianjin and fell in Harbin. Gai Jiaotian is performing on stage again, but it is difficult to get a seat without begging. Looking back on those years, there is a true sense of "past events are unbearable to recall."

### A Viewing of the Shanghai Bank Peking Opera Society's Rehearsal

— Lao Yang

The Shanghai Bank Colleagues Peking Opera Society held its third rehearsal at 7 pm on the third afternoon. I, the reporter, was fortunate to be seated in the last row and enjoyed a feast for the ears. By the time the play ended and I returned home, it was already midnight. Rubbing my tired eyes, I will briefly record the outline. My words are not worthy of the attention of the elegant. I arrived a little late, and the "Tifang" had already reached its finale, so I only heard half of his slow Xipi.

The second play was "Cosmic Peak." The actress playing Zhao Nv was Wei Meiyu. Her appearance was delicate and graceful, fitting the identity of a young lady. Her singing was smooth and she was not a novice, which was extraordinary. However, her voice was slightly astringent, making her seem strained. I don't know if this was due to practicing her voice. Ms. Zhu's face is full at the top and narrow at the bottom. She can slightly stick out the part near the cheekbones. The lipstick she applied was also slightly too light. If these small points are modified, there may not be much obvious difference when she puts on makeup in front of the mirror, but it will definitely increase the beauty when viewed from the stage below. This is originally a major play for Qingyi, and even experts don't easily perform it. However, Ms. Zhu's performance was balanced and steady, neither too hot nor too cold, which was truly not easy. Her lying-down body movements showed her skill.

The third play was "Fenhe Bay." Wu Hongyou and Ms. Wu Danru played the fake couple, making the "Trouble at the Kiln" scene even more realistic. I wonder if Mr. Wu had forgotten that he was an actor when he knelt down to apologize. (laughs) I heard that Mrs. Wu was making her debut on the stage, but her singing and acting were all stable and flawless, which was commendable. Her voice was broad and sweet. With further polishing, her potential is limitless. I heard that Mr. Wu has been on stage several times, but he has always played comic roles, and this was his first time playing a Lao Sheng. His appearance was majestic and upright, showing the demeanor of the half-Liao King. Mr. Wu should decide to abandon his comic roles and study Lao Sheng from now on. This play has more acting than singing, which makes amateur performers afraid. Mr. and Mrs. Wu's cooperation was skillful and did not seem like their first time performing together. This cannot be achieved without talent. Specifically speaking, Mr. Wu's recitation is better than his singing, and Mrs. Wu's singing and acting are better than her recitation. These humble opinions may be of assistance to Mr. and Mrs. Wu in their discussions. Su Xiaxuan and Ms. Su Shiqiu played the old landlord and Xue Dingshan respectively. Ms. Shiqiu's voice was broad and bright, and her singing had a lot of charm. Her small test of her skills was not enough to show her full potential. When Xue Pinggui appeared for the second time, singing "Leaving Fenhe Bay..." in a continuous stream, the scene started with a Yao Ban, but the first two sentences did not match the singing. It was not until the third sentence that they were in sync. I don't know why. I, the reporter, have no stage experience with this play and dare not assume I am right, but I will record it here and ask those who were present that day to correct me.

The fourth play was "Dianhe Yang." Zhao Zhongguang played Liu Bei, Chen Baode played Zhao Yun, and Zhu Xieqing played Zhou Yu. The combination was well-matched and the chemistry was extraordinary. Both actors put in a lot of effort, with excellent singing and acting. Liu Huangshu's sudden joy and fear were deeply expressed. Zhou Dudu's inner thoughts were expressed through his performance. Zhou Jiangjun's energy was full and he was fearless, all vividly portrayed. They are not much different from professionals. However, there is a difference of one tone between Mr. Zhu's and Mr. Chen's voices. It seems that both of them felt a little strained when choosing the right key. Because I, the reporter, had other matters to attend to, I left before the end and could not enjoy "Fan Jiangguan," which was a pity. The reception by the above-mentioned people was warm and courteous, and they were meticulous in their entertainment. Their spirit of dedication is admirable.

### About "Cloud Garment Fairy"

Chen Yunshang's "Cloud Garment Fairy," which was filmed after "Mulan Joins the Army," has been completed in terms of editing and other projects, and will be released by Shanghai's two major film companies in the near future. "Cloud Garment Fairy" is a masterpiece of domestic song and dance films. It has four great song and dance scenes, and the scenery is more magnificent than any previous song and dance film. Chen Yunshang specially made dozens of costumes for filming "Cloud Garment Fairy." She appears in different costumes in each shot. There are more than a dozen famous songs, mostly sung by Ms. Chen, with the full participation of all students of the Xinhua Dance Troupe.

### A Further Record of Dance Traces

The comic role playing a bailiff in "Fishing and Killing the Family" often says "Leaving the house" at the beginning, some adding "It's still that sentence," which can usually amuse the audience. Doing dance articles is the same. After doing them over and over again, they only write about the same things: "dance guests," "dance girls," and dance halls. I'm tired of writing it myself. Surprisingly, some people still send letters of praise, saying that it contains philosophical thoughts and is beneficial to social morality. Some even invite me to dinner. This really makes me feel infinitely grateful on the one hand and ashamed on the other. I feel like I can't write anything for this issue. Oh well, since I wrote about dance traces last issue, I won't do one again this time. It's like saying "Leaving the river, coming home," even though it's said by a comic role, it's still interesting.

Because I always write my articles on Friday, I'm always in a hurry. So, after sending in my last article, I decided that I would definitely write the title in my notebook on Sunday. It's quiet and comfortable to write at that time. After I wrote the title for this issue, I thought of a way to add supplementary material. Originally, I always went to dance halls passively, following the ideas of my friends. How about being more proactive? That is, I can go or not as I please. If I do go, I can only write about the places I've been to this period in the next issue. Otherwise, I won't accompany them. This way, I can add more material to my articles, and it seems like I'm feeling a new kind of fun. The following dance halls are listed in order of my visits:

Weigong—It's across from the Shanghai Bank and next to the Dengshuo Mo Hotel. The advertisement says it's like going to Peach Blossom Dock. A friend invited me to lunch, which suited my heart. There's a fake rockery cave on the stairs leading to the entrance. Lanterns and flowers are placed every three steps, and willows are placed every five steps, hidden in the dim light. It's really hard to tell the real from the fake. There are also several thatched huts inside, which emit a creaking sound. Where does this sound come from? Forgive me for not announcing it for the time being. You can go see for yourself.

Xinhua—I probably wrote about the general situation in the fourth issue. Now, other than the dance girl Chen Rong having changed slightly, there are no other changes. This time, we went with partners, so we only danced with Lin Yamei once. Yamei's face is not beautiful, but it has a refined air. She has lost some weight recently, making her look even more slender. If men were to talk about it, they would say she has a bit of a scholarly air. When I said she was thin, she insisted she was fat, but the smile on her face always had a forced look. It is said that she has been seen recently. Could she have some unspeakable secret?

Xiaoyao—It's really strange. One night, a friend invited me and actually brought three popular dance girls from high-end dance halls to Xiaoyao. At first, when I heard about Xiaoyao, I didn't know where it was. When we arrived, I realized it was the former Queen's Theater. The stage has been changed into a music platform, which seems a bit too big. The dance floor seems too long, but the floor is still smooth. The seats and people are certainly not comparable to those in high-end dance halls, but there are quite a few dance girls. I just took a quick look, but there are probably beauties within ten steps.

Anlegong—The name ABC is in the eastern section of Avenue Edward VII. I patronized it quite often last year. I haven't been there for a long time, but it's still the same. The lunchtime music seems too lively. My friend originally taught Shu Yunlan and received two apprentices, A Zhen and A Zhu, who are from Hangzhou. They can write a few words and are said to have graduated from elementary school.

Xianle—After going to small dance halls for a few days, going to a big dance hall again naturally makes me feel luxurious and magnificent. However, that night, several friends and I had things to do early the next morning, so we just sat there for a while and returned feeling bored. This shows that the power of the mind is ultimately greater than the power of the environment. The Buddha said that everything is created by the mind, and the Confucian said that contentment brings happiness. A mind that is not content can make people feel that they would be happier staying at home, even more than going to a dance hall.

In addition, I went to Dahua and Dadu Hui once each. The article is already long, so I won't write much more. At Dahua, I met a dance star who is also called Hu Ying and is also quite beautiful. It is said that the Changzhou Hu Ying only dances at night. However, is that person from Changzhou really called Hu Ying? Or can we only say that it's uncertain? I can only scold myself and say I'm very confused.

### Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden

— Xu Muyun

Two things about the late righteous actor Luo Kuifang are worth mentioning.

The first thing is when he was first making a name for himself in Beiping. It was during the late Qing Dynasty, before private performances were abolished. Xiao Bao was born at the wrong time. Since he was in this line of work, he naturally couldn't break this bad environment. He had to come out and pour wine with a group of fellow students. At that time, he was only around twenty years old. He had delicate features and fair skin. He had a long braid and bangs. Wearing a Thirteen Taibao vest, he was indeed a handsome man. At that time, he was greatly favored by a certain general, who often invited him out to drink. On days when he had a performance, the general would definitely reserve several rows of seats or several boxes, spending a lot of money on him. This matter was seen as a great honor by Xiao Bao's group of fellow students, who were all envious. However, Xiao Bao himself not only didn't appreciate it, but also deeply hated the general's entanglement, as if he was deliberately trying to insult him. However, because he had a strict teacher by his side at the time, he could only feel resentment in his heart. Later, he suddenly realized that if he didn't get rid of this inhuman life early, he would never have a chance to rise up in the future. After he made up his mind, he continued to feign compliance with the general on the one hand, and secretly studied the old Sheng roles on the other hand. Sometimes when Lao Tan sang "Empty City Stratagem," Xiao Bao would ask his teacher to tell the backstage manager to assign him the role of a qintong (at that time, Lao Tan was in the same troupe as Yao Qing). So, he later became famous for singing "Empty City" because he had been one of the qintongs several times and had heard Lao Tan's tunes very clearly. The general didn't see through his secret intentions at all and still spared no effort in supporting him. Who would have thought that as soon as he left his apprenticeship, he would immediately become a student of a certain boss and specialize in Song Sheng roles? He even made three rules with his newly apprenticed teacher. The first rule was that he would no longer go out to pour wine, so as not to hinder his studies. Because of all these things he did, he didn't tell the general in advance. When the general repeatedly invited him, he refused to go. The general asked someone to find him, but he refused to meet him several times. The general was so angry that he almost went crazy. From then on, the two of them broke off contact. Later, the general desperately spent money to organize a troupe and tried his best to make a certain actress popular, said to be because he was stimulated by Xiao Bao and was venting his anger out of disappointment.

### Xuan Palace Tonight's Rehearsal

— Lu

Tonight is Saturday night again. In addition to the usual "Peking Opera Joint Performance" at Xuan Palace, there will also be a rehearsal. A stage will be added to the music, and colored scenery will be hung in front of the musicians' seats. This is truly an unprecedented record for a dance hall, giving dance guests a lot of interest and constantly stimulating them until dawn. According to a certain spokesperson, he can guarantee that the guests will not yawn once. According to the investigation, there are a total of three plays rehearsing tonight. One is the dance star Fan Peilan's "Qijie" and Zhang Yetao Suqiu's "New Cotton Spinning." Another is the "Touring Dragon and Playing Phoenix" of the seven-year-old Lingtong Primary School Zhuanlan, which is not easy to see elsewhere. It is admirable that such young children are performing those women's things, which is enough to satisfy many. Finally, I will report on the Xuan Palace's garden dance hall, the jealousy work, and the follow-up.

### Mongolia and Russia Open Trade Routes

### Leisurely Comments on Theater

Theaters in Shanghai stand tall, but Jin Gui of Dan Du Village is known as the best; however, Jin Gui is only great at martial arts, with knives, spears, swords, halberds and somersaults, which quickly gets boring. The singing and acting of the actors and actresses are simply not on the same level; not as compelling and talented as Dan Gui. For example, Yang Yuelou is lively and spirited, with beautiful art and good looks; Han Guixi is lively and exuberant, to the point of perfection; Chen Jitai and Tian Hei are as fast as monkeys and as light as flying swallows, which is good to behold. Compared to Jin Gui's Yue Shan and Hei Er, they are no better. Others, such as Jing Sibao and Wu Fengming, mimic the actors perfectly; Tu Bian Er and Zao Er are playful. As for the beautiful scenery and the pearly and melodious voices, there is Wang Guifang and Li Dixiang; elegant and unconventional, and unrestrained, there is Du Dieyun and Feng Sanxi; vying to outdo each other, and trying their best, there is An Jingzhi; the others have their own strengths and are hard to list; the admiration is well placed.

### Several Couplets

The first line of the couplet was created by this newspaper's poetry forum, here are some of the best responses:

(1) Smoke and fire are everywhere, when the flowers wither and the smoke dissipates, what will be the outcome? Clouds and rain fill the sky, but one day the rain will stop and the clouds will scatter, revealing the true form.

(2) Sun and moon combine to bring light and divide day and night. Sons and daughters together judge the world.

(3) Because fire becomes smoke, if you don't discard it, it will always be suffering. Wanting the heart, to remove it, can be called human.

(4) The self-ringing clock rings twelve times, always self-ringing. The ferry boat swings people over and over, always swinging.

(5) Dongting Lake, Dongting Mountain, the land is divided between Wu and Chu. Tianzhu Kingdom, Tianzhu Temple, the names are famous in China and foreign lands.

To be published tomorrow: Foreigners being burned at the manufacturing bureau. Qi Chang earns interest.
